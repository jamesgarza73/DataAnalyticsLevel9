With Deportivo resigned to their fate, Henry collected Kanu's clever pass and beat Kouba from 15 yards just to make sure. \u0095 Arsenal will play Werder Bremen in the quarter-finals after the Germans beat Parma 3-1 at home last night. \u0095 Celta Vigo completed a miserable week for Italian clubs in a competition they have won eight times in the past 11 years by knocking out the favourites Juventus 4-1 on aggregate after a 4-0 win in Spain last night, South Africa's Benny McCarthy scoring twice. Deportivo La Coruna (4-4-2): Kouba; Scaloni, Ramis, Naybet, Manel; Jaime (Fran, 64min), Mauro Silva, Turu Flores, Fernando (Ivan Perez, 80); Makaay (Victor, 56), Pauleta. Arsenal (4-4-1-1): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Petit, Silvinho; Parlour, Vieira, Winterburn (Vernazza, 84), Ljungberg; Kanu (Malz, 83); Henry (Suker, 79). Referee: O Sarvan (Turkey).",

In the 21st century, it has evolved into a corporate-legal complex. Here is the new threat: global behemoths commanding platoons of besuited lawyers to intimidate and enforce silence. Able to do so, moreover, with more money and power than many nation states, unencumbered by their quaint checks and balances - yet with all the paranoia, secrecy and sleek determination of any nation state on a war footing. </p> <p>Mann's riveting film is based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a scientist and disgruntled employee of a giant US Big Tobacco firm. He comes to Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer on the CBS 60 Minutes television show, with a sensational story. Despite the cigarette moguls' sworn testimony that their product is not addictive, Wigand says his entire career has been devoted to making it precisely that - designing cigarettes as miniaturised \"nicotine delivery systems\" and enhancing their addictive properties. Instantly, his firm unleashes its nuclear arsenal of threats and writs; Wigand and his family are mysteriously threatened, and sinister corporate influences induce CBS to take Wigand's explosive interview off air. </p> <p>Like his 1995 mega-thriller Heat, Mann's picture unfolds across a big canvas and yet cinematographer Dante Spinotti focuses with fanatical, almost dysfunctional intensity on the textures and surfaces of ordinary life - the car dash, the take-out coffee cup, the wiry grain of chain-hotel carpeting: all this is represented with a compulsively strange, jittery urgency as Wigand conducts his panicky secret conversations with Bergman. </p> <p>The most important surface Mann picks out is that of Wigand's face, looming in almost unendurable close-up, pale, sweaty, on the edge of cracking up. This is a very strong performance from Russell Crowe: a completely believable human complex of vanity, courage, self-doubt, fear and despair. Al Pacino is not as impressive, turning in essentially a similar tough-guy performance as his Vincent Hanna in Heat - only this time without a badge and a gun - Pacino does the same even, middleweight job. He has machismo and tough professionalism, and does a lot of curious emotionless shouting in that croaky wrecked voice (a 40-a-day man, surely?). There is simply not much light-and-shade in Pacino's screen presence, no sense of self-questioning or vulnerability, and the fact that he is forced into a very similar position as Wigand at the end points up the material superiority of Crowe's performance. Pacino could play a cop, a mafioso, an investigative journalist, a jockey, a vet - and I fear it would all sound the same. </p> <p>Mann's new thriller appears at a turning point in the cultural history of cigarettes. Just as the tobacco giants are beginning to concede vital points in the courts, thus exposing themselves to the lawsuits they have feared for so long, a libertarian current of politics has made fags fashionable again. Authors like Richard Klein have dashingly made the case for their place in the arena of individual responsibility and pleasure, and revived a Wildean sense of the cigarette as the self-consuming icon of useless delight. However, in the daily drizzle of media commentary, this means that the politically correct anti-smoking bore has been replaced by the equally tiresome opposite: dullard pundits and salaryman columnists incessantly ordering us to admire their adorable courage and sheer intellectual gristle in smoking fags. </p> <p>Mann's film, as well as being in the enjoyable line of conspiracy thrillers like The Conversation, has its own intelligible and lucid relationship to this debate. It is a refreshing corrective to the cigarette industry's sleight-of-hand claims to victim status: a chilling study of a gigantic corporate overdog ruthlessly exercising its unexamined prerogative to threaten and bully the individual. It is based on an article by Marie Brenner for Vanity Fair. As it happens, I have long fantasised about a cigarette conspiracy thriller based on Michael Massing's essay for the New York Review of Books in July 1996, which among other things, discussed Big Tobacco's nastiest secret - the central importance to the industry of children taking up smoking, the seed-corn of long-term addiction without which the cigarette business would go broke in one generation. </p> <p>But The Insider does more than enough in this and every other regard: it is big, brash, thrilling, and exhilaratingly contemporary, and pretty addictive on its own.</p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/eventsandoffers/article/0,5992,145256,00.html\">Win a copy</a> of the Insider soundtrack</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It takes a special kind of magic to obscure the best education settlement in decades in the manner of Nick Davies. </p> <p>Let's start with an independent fact. The Institute of Fiscal Studies confirmed in its Green Budget that \"by 2002, Labour will have achieved an annualised real increase in education spending of 3.2%, double that of the last administration and more than twice that of the Conservatives over their entire term of office from 1979 to 1997\". </p> <p>Sustained increases are going into schools in a way which never happened before. The Conservatives had a one-off increase in 1992 and cut spending afterwards. Real spending per pupil fell by \u00a350 in last three Conservative budgets. In contrast, there will be a real terms increase of \u00a3200 per pupil in this parliament. </p> <p>Of course, we are still in the first year of the three-year spending review, so only a magician would expect schools to have seen results of the whole three years before the first year is over. </p> <p>When we were elected, the 1997-8 Budget (which Davies seems to think I was responsible for) had already been agreed and distributed. With Gordon Brown we took immediate action to give schools an emergency injection of \u00a3835m extra cash for 1998-9, avoiding a further \u00a340 real terms cut per pupil. </p> <p>Nick Davies dismisses increased spending on repairs. Yet twice as much is now being spent as under the Conservatives. With the new deal for schools, over 10,000 schools have already had or are undergoing improvement: much of it substantial. As well as new classrooms for infants and the removal of the last outside toilets, 260 schools are benefiting from substantial buildings improvement or replacement projects through public-private partnerships. </p> <p> Graciously, Nick Davies concedes that we have increased the standards fund. Yet he has made several errors here too. Few grants rely on bids now. The fund which enables us to provide grants for literacy and numeracy or teacher training has increased from \u00a3190m in 1997-8 to over \u00a3820m in grant in 2001-2. Some programmes involve 50% (not 60%) match funding from authorities. Others like class sizes and computer funding are funded fully by the government. This is also true from this coming April of the highly popular excellence in cities programme. </p> <p>Is any of this making a difference? The evidence certainly suggests it is. Standards in the 3Rs have risen as a result of the literacy and numeracy hours. The recent Guardian/ICM poll showed that most primary school parents believed standards in their own primary school had risen as a result. Four times as many primary schools are linked to the internet and schools are being equipped with com puters. Teachers are being trained to use the net. </p> <p>We are able to fund \u00a32,000 increases in annual pay for good teachers - on top of the annual 3.3% award. Schools in the inner cities have got extra money for mentors to help tackle disaffection as well as new units for disruptive pupils and programmes for able children. I'm acting so that we don't simply leave weak and failing schools to sink as the Tories were happy to do (and as Nick Davies advocated on Monday), but at the same time we recognise that good schools should have the chance to flourish without excessive intervention. </p> <p>We are spending \u00a3140m this year on tackling truancy and exclusions compared with \u00a322m a year under the Conservatives. We are spending \u00a3160m this year on cutting class sizes - something ignored by the last government. </p> <p>I know that further and higher education are often relegated to section two of the Guardian on a Tuesday, but that is no reason for your star investigator to miss them completely in his lengthy and supposedly comprehensive piece. In fact, further education colleges which educate over 4m students have seen their budgets increase from \u00a33.1bn in 1997-98 to almost \u00a33.9 bn in 2001-2. Similarly, extra research funding and more money for standards and access means that universities will get an extra \u00a31bn in spending by 2002, together with \u00a31.4bn for research from the government and Wellcome Trust for research. </p> <p>Let us imagine two other scenarios. The Liberal Democrats argued for an extra \"penny on income tax\" at the last election to fund education. Had they done so, there would have been an extra \u00a32bn a year on top of Conservative spending plans - less than half of what we are spending. Had the Conservatives won the election, we would have had even less funding in real terms than in their last Budget in 1997. </p> <p>Of course we need to make sure as much of the money as possible gets directly to schools - and I have taken steps to ensure that happens. We need to sustain increased investment in the years to come. The prime minister recognises that as much as I do. But it is as absurd to pretend that what is happening now represents little change from the past as it would be to suggest that we didn't need to see more money for education in the future. </p> <p>\u0095 David Blunkett is secretary of state for education.</p>",

The recent Guardian/ICM poll showed that most primary school parents believed standards in their own primary school had risen as a result. Four times as many primary schools are linked to the internet and schools are being equipped with com puters. Teachers are being trained to use the net. We are able to fund \u00a32,000 increases in annual pay for good teachers - on top of the annual 3.3% award. Schools in the inner cities have got extra money for mentors to help tackle disaffection as well as new units for disruptive pupils and programmes for able children. I'm acting so that we don't simply leave weak and failing schools to sink as the Tories were happy to do (and as Nick Davies advocated on Monday), but at the same time we recognise that good schools should have the chance to flourish without excessive intervention. We are spending \u00a3140m this year on tackling truancy and exclusions compared with \u00a322m a year under the Conservatives. We are spending \u00a3160m this year on cutting class sizes - something ignored by the last government. I know that further and higher education are often relegated to section two of the Guardian on a Tuesday, but that is no reason for your star investigator to miss them completely in his lengthy and supposedly comprehensive piece. In fact, further education colleges which educate over 4m students have seen their budgets increase from \u00a33.1bn in 1997-98 to almost \u00a33.9 bn in 2001-2. Similarly, extra research funding and more money for standards and access means that universities will get an extra \u00a31bn in spending by 2002, together with \u00a31.4bn for research from the government and Wellcome Trust for research. Let us imagine two other scenarios. The Liberal Democrats argued for an extra \"penny on income tax\" at the last election to fund education. Had they done so, there would have been an extra \u00a32bn a year on top of Conservative spending plans - less than half of what we are spending. Had the Conservatives won the election, we would have had even less funding in real terms than in their last Budget in 1997. Of course we need to make sure as much of the money as possible gets directly to schools - and I have taken steps to ensure that happens. We need to sustain increased investment in the years to come. The prime minister recognises that as much as I do. But it is as absurd to pretend that what is happening now represents little change from the past as it would be to suggest that we didn't need to see more money for education in the future. \u0095 David Blunkett is secretary of state for education.",

The WFP plans to carry 25 tonnes of food to Mahanoro, a town of 30,000 on the east coast, followed by another 375 tonnes to communities in the north-east and west where no aid has yet arrived. The latest figures suggest that at least 130 people have died and more than 10,000 have been made homeless by two cyclones that ripped across the island. Cyclone Eline struck last month before moving on to cause devastating floods in Mozambique 400km across the Mozambique Channel. Then Cyclone Gloria hit the north-east of the island last week. The United Nations has appealed for donations of food, medicines, blankets and water purification tablets. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has warned that the huge scale of the crisis in Mozambique has deflected attention away from the dramatic plight of Madagascar. So far the extent of the disaster is only partially understood as flooded areas can only be approached by helicopter. It is thought that about 12,000 people are cut off by flooding and are likely to be running out of food and clean water. Apart from the human suffering, there is likely to have been substantial damage to Madagascar's unique ecosystem. As the world's fourth largest island, it is home to thousands of plants and animals found nowhere else, including 40 species of lemurs and many types of chameleons. Eyewitnesses say hundreds of birds and animals - such as the monkey-like lemur - have been spotted dead in the floodwaters.",

      "bodyText": "Military scientists have had difficulty in recruiting enough human \"guinea pigs\" for their chemical warfare experiments in recent years, internal documents from the ministry of defence reveal. The shortage has slowed the rate of experiments at the secretive Porton Down chemical defence establishment in Wiltshire, a source said. An official history of the human trials, obtained by the Guardian, catalogues how Porton Down frequently struggled to attract enough volunteers for its experiments between the 1920s and the 1960s. Its recruitment practices during the cold war are being investigated by Wiltshire police after human guinea pigs complained that they were tricked into taking part in poison gas experiments. The guinea pigs claim that they had volunteered for research to find a cure for the common cold but ended up in Porton Down's gas chambers. Wiltshire detectives are also examining the death of Ronald Maddison, 20, an airman who had nerve gas dripped on to his arm in a 1953 trial. Porton Down is believed to have conducted the longest running programme of chemical warfare experiments on humans in the world. At least 20,000 volunteers have taken part in the past 80 years, although even this number has not been enough to satisfy the scientists' demands. The volunteers, recruited from military units, often spend around two weeks at Porton Down. Recent recruitment figures are in annual reports of the establishment's independent ethics committee, which monitors the tests, and have been released to the Liberal Democrats' economy spokesman, Matthew Taylor. The latest figures show that 72 volunteers took part in the experiments in 1998, two thirds of the overall number requested. In 1996 50 volunteers were recruited, just under half of the total wanted. In other years since 1994, between 71% and 77% of the number requested took part in tests. Mr Taylor said yesterday: \"Given Porton Down's record, no wonder it's having problems getting volunteers for its experiments. \"Many volunteers from the past are complaining that their health has been damaged by tests at Porton Down. The government has failed to investigate their health problems properly. \"This does not inspire confidence among service men and women to make themselves available for the tests.\" The shortage of volunteers has not prevented tests from being completed. A source close to Porton Down suggested that military personnel were reluctant to volunteer because they were worried about what the scientists would do to them; the financial inducements were poor and their commanding officers were unwilling to let them leave their units. A spokeswoman said Britain's military commitments abroad, for example in the former Yugoslavia, prevented some personnel from volunteering. \"It may not be easy for military units to release service personnel to go to Porton for two week periods.\" Recruitment had improved in recent months, but figures could not be released. Compared with the cold war period, Porton Down's programme of experiments has been much scaled down, typically using fewer than 100 volunteers a year. The volunteers mainly test equipment which protects individuals from chemical and biological weapons. They are also given anti-gas drugs to see if they have any unpleasant side effects.

'I may wear Lycra and cotton blends, but never spandex. It makes my skin break out.' \" </p> <p>MacIntosh ran a clarification the next day but perhaps she needn't have. Lycra is, in fact, a brand of spandex, the term used in Canada and the US for what the rest of the world knows as elastene. But the pop diva is not the only one to get it wrong. In the 40 years since it was invented, Lycra has so permeated mainstream consciousness that, like Hoover, it's often mistaken for a generic term.</p> <p>Can you believe a fabric with such modern connotations is already 40? Lycra was invented in 1958 by Joe Shivers, an engineer for science company DuPont. Originally known as Fiber K, it was given the name Lycra precisely because it didn't mean anything: DuPont had a computer programme designed to come up with five- or six-letter words that were meaningless in every language and therefore easier to sell globally. Once christened, Lycra began to replace rubber in corsets; in 1962, it appeared in support tights. Swimwear came next (1974), followed by sheer hosiery (1979), sportswear (1985), clothing (1993) and wool (1996). These days, you can find the magical stretchy fibre in everything from Gucci shoes and Hugo Boss suits to your humble M&amp;S knickers.</p> <p>To describe somebody as \"Lycra-clad\" is to conjure a picture of 80s-style black leggings and tight stretchy tops. But the fabric is actually a lot more versatile than that. As DuPont Lycra global brand manager Linda Kearns points out: \"Stretchy and clingy don't have to go together.\"</p> <p>Lycra isn't used as a fabric on its own but is blended with other fibres, such as cotton, nylon and wool, where its impressive stretching capabilities (it can stretch up to 600% and return to its original shape) do more than simply make things tighter. Certainly 20% Lycra content will keep your swimwear clinging in all the right places; slightly less will be enough to mould your leggings to your body. But add just 2% to a pair of khakis and you'll stop them bagging at the knees; add a smidgeon to a full skirt and you'll simply improve its drape; blend with linen and you will give the famously crinkly fibre new crease-resistant properties.</p> <p>All of which is certainly impressive and welcome in modern wardrobes. But why is Lycra believed to do this better than any other brand of elastene? Mariah Carey is not the only one who thinks it's somehow superior to every other stretchy fibre - we all look for LYCRA in our knickers.</p> <p>According to Kearns, this is down to two factors: Lycra's unique formulations are obviously important, but DuPont also spends more on research and development, she says, than all its competitors combined. As a result, it has come up with such innovations as leather with Lycra and the sportswear fibre LYCRAPOWER, said to improve performance by up to 30%.</p> <p> As for Lycra's relationship with its partners: \"We don't just stop at selling the fibre.\" DuPont stays with them all the way, getting involved in everything from quality specifications to marketing of the finished garments. The company wants to be able to guarantee the quality of everything that has a Lycra swing ticket attached.</p> <p>Marketing has obviously had a lot to do with it. It is DuPont's business to make you care what brand of manmade fibre keeps your underwear stretchy. Over the years, the company has actively pursued the fashion vote; it enlisted legendary photographer Richard Avedon to shoot a 1994 promotional campaign and continues to seek celebrity endorsements. This year, DuPont sponsored the glossy fashion tome Millennium Mode, which featured designers' visions for the 21st century, while the Lycra website proudly quotes the likes of Calvin Klein (\"Lycra isn't in or out of fashion. It's a way of life\") and American designer Mark Eisen (\"Lycra has changed the entire dynamics of fit\").</p> <p>The teen market, meanwhile, is being convinced of the benefits of Lycra thanks to the brand's sponsorship of events such as Summer Music Mania, featuring the likes of Britney Spears. \"The teen audience is influencing fashion trends around the world,\" Kearns explains. \"We want them to understand that not all stretch is created equal.\"</p> <p>Do the kids care? DuPont thinks so. Recent research commissioned by the company found close to 40% of young people in Europe and 50% in the US claim they check the fibre content of the clothes they buy.

About 30 passengers were on board and there were a large number of injuries but they are not believed to be serious.\"</p> <p>Ambulance crews were at the scene on platform five treating whiplash-type injuries, he added. A London ambulance service official said there were three stretcher cases and 15 others had minor injuries.</p> <p>Ten ambulances and two motor cycle paramedics went to the scene after the service was alerted.</p> <p>South West Trains said the incident involved an empty train which had travelled to Waterloo from nearby Clapham. The train was due to link up with a train from Hampton Court to form the 1352 service from Waterloo to Chessington.</p> <p>A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: \"At about 2pm, police were called by the London ambulance service in response to reports of an incident at Waterloo. At this early stage, it appears a slow moving train coming into the station was in collision with a stationary train at platform five. This second train was empty. We are told that there are about 25 walking wounded, and no serious injuries.\"</p> <p>The British rail system came under intense criticism after the train crash just outside Paddington last October that killed 31 people.</p> <p>Last month, a report into the Southall train crash cited a breakdown of the safety system and the fragmentation of the rail industry since privatisation for the 1997 accident.</p> <p>The two incidents and numerous lapses in rail safety have brought new pressures on the government to reverse the rail sell-off.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's railways came under renewed questioning today after a crash at Waterloo station that resulted in minor injuries to at least 25 people. In the latest blow to the country's embattled rail system, a South West Trains service hit a stationary train as it entered a platform at the busy terminus at about 1.50pm. A British transport police official said: \"A train hit another stationary train as it arrived at the station. About 30 passengers were on board and there were a large number of injuries but they are not believed to be serious.\" Ambulance crews were at the scene on platform five treating whiplash-type injuries, he added. A London ambulance service official said there were three stretcher cases and 15 others had minor injuries. Ten ambulances and two motor cycle paramedics went to the scene after the service was alerted. South West Trains said the incident involved an empty train which had travelled to Waterloo from nearby Clapham. The train was due to link up with a train from Hampton Court to form the 1352 service from Waterloo to Chessington. A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: \"At about 2pm, police were called by the London ambulance service in response to reports of an incident at Waterloo. At this early stage, it appears a slow moving train coming into the station was in collision with a stationary train at platform five. This second train was empty. We are told that there are about 25 walking wounded, and no serious injuries.\" The British rail system came under intense criticism after the train crash just outside Paddington last October that killed 31 people. Last month, a report into the Southall train crash cited a breakdown of the safety system and the fragmentation of the rail industry since privatisation for the 1997 accident. The two incidents and numerous lapses in rail safety have brought new pressures on the government to reverse the rail sell-off.",

It'll just be for slow guitar, soft trumpet and a bell.' So said Sonny Liston in 1962, after he'd beaten his closest rival, Floyd Patterson, and become Heavyweight Champion of the World. Liston was not known for his sensitivity. Indeed, the facts of his life read like a blueprint for a Hollywood film of the flawed fighter. He was born in Arkansas, the 24th of 25 children. He never knew the date or exact place of his birth, and he was illiterate. He was sent out to work in the fields at the age of eight, picking cotton, peanuts and sweet potato. He was beaten prodigiously by his father and the welts he received were still visible on his adult body. When his mother left Arkansas to find work in St Louis he followed her, but he was unable to hold down a job and turned to crime. By the age of 16 Liston was over six feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds. He was violent as well as strong and earned his first title, that of 'Number One Negro' on the St Louis police wanted list, in 1949. In 1950, he was convicted of armed robbery (his haul was $37). He was introduced to boxing at the Missouri State Penitentiary. </p> <p>On his release, Liston began a professional boxing career while at the same time working as a 'head breaker' for the Mafia. He was an outstanding success in both roles. In 1956, he was convicted of assaulting a policeman and received a nine-month prison sentence, after which sabbatical he became far more deeply involved with New York mobsters and made Philadelphia his home. He was by now loathed by the press and feared by the public. When he won the world title in 1962 he flew back to his adoptive city expecting a reception committee. There was no one at the airport to greet him and in 1963 he left Philadelphia in disgust, remarking: 'I'd rather be a lamp-post in Denver than mayor of Philadelphia.' </p> <p>If Liston led a complicated public life, his arch rival's inner life was far from straightforward. Floyd Patterson grew up in Brooklyn. 'I don't like that boy!' he would say to his mother, pointing to a photograph of himself. At the age of nine, he took the photograph down and scratched crosses over the face. He, too, turned to petty crime and was sent to reform school. This proved to be a redemptive experience and when he returned to New York he took up boxing, under the tutelage of Cus D'Amato at the Gramercy Gym: in 1952 he won a gold medal at the Helsinki Olympics. He was much smaller than many of his opponents and learned to overcome this handicap by leaping into them - almost the Patterson trademark. He became World Heavyweight Champion at 21, the youngest there had ever been. </p> <p>Patterson's neuroses pursued him into adulthood: he was so prone to introspection that boxing writers nicknamed him Freud Patterson. He worried about his opponents getting hurt and refused to make eye contact with them at weigh-ins or press conferences, saying: 'We're going to fight, which is not a nice thing.' A devout Roman Catholic, he took it on himself to be the champion of Christendom and the Civil Rights movement. When he was beaten by Liston, he pasted on a false beard - he had brought one with him in case of defeat - and took a flight to Madrid, where he walked around the poor quarters of the city faking a limp and eating only soup 'because that's what old men do'. </p> <p>Patterson and Liston dominated boxing in the 1950s and early 1960s, and in the eyes of the public, all was well with the world. In one corner, Patterson, integrationist, scared of upsetting the white neighbours, grateful for his opportunities. In the other, Liston, who was without politics but stood for black criminality, sexual menace and resentment. Even better, the two men knew their place. Patterson was summoned to the White House before the Liston fight: 'You've got to beat this guy,' JFK told him, showing what could be gained by conforming to white rules. Liston's behaviour simply affirmed the stereotype of the 'bad nigger', justifying discrimination against those who stepped out of line. </p> <p>Enter Muhammad Ali, who over the next few years was to change the face of boxing. David Remnick's book in fact concentrates on the two astonishing fights Ali had with Liston (Ali won the title in the first and defended it successfully in the second), and on the relationship between Ali, Liston and Patterson. For Remnick, as for most people, there is no one greater than Ali: he is not just a boxing phenomenon but a figure commanding world-wide veneration. He does not come out of the book as well as he might, however. So perfect is he made to seem that his character lacks vibrancy. Remnick's reader knows that every adversary will be conquered or contained by a mixture of charm, mischief and grace. And so Liston, Patterson and other characters on the periphery seem to have more life. </p> <p>In their fighting days the reverse was the case. The public felt they understood the two older boxers, and it was Ali who had the room to experiment, to create uncertainty in the minds of both the public and his fellow boxers. To watch Prince Naseem or Chris Eubank today is to see a clumsy rehash of Ali in the early years, when he seemed so threatening, so unconstrained by the social rules willingly or unconsciously accepted by Liston or Patterson. The space in which imagination and conjecture could float freely has long since been filled in, however. Nowadays, Ali is a secular saint and every off-the-cuff remark he ever made has been set down as Holy Writ. It is out of the sadness or failure of his contemporaries that genuine expressions of humanity are more likely to emerge. </p> <p>Cassius Clay was born in 1942 into the Southern black middle class. He seems to have had a heightened racial awareness from an early age. As a four-year-old he asked his father: 'Daddy, I go to the grocery and the grocery man is white. The bus driver is white. What do the coloured people do?' When he was 12, his bike was stolen and he went to complain to a police officer who happened to run a boxing gym. He was persuaded to try the sport and quickly showed himself to be a natural. He also had the rigid discipline to go with his talent, and became obsessed with training. He was never violent outside the ring and was such a model student in every way except the academic that when he didn't get the results needed to graduate from high school, his headmaster made an impassioned speech to the rest of the staff: 'One day our greatest claim to fame is going to be that we knew Cassius Clay or taught him . . . Do you think I'm going to be the principal of a school that Cassius Clay didn't finish? If every teacher here fails him, he's still not going to fail. He's not going to fail in my school. I'm going to say I taught him!' You can almost hear the opening number of 'Ali the Musical', as the headmaster and a troupe of dancing teachers prepare to sing the showstopper: 'He's a knock-out not a drop-out.' Clay graduated and went on to win an Olympic title in Rome in 1960. </p> <p>When he turned professional, he won backing from a group of wealthy Louisville businessmen. A few years earlier he might have followed Liston into the arms of the Mob: instead, he was drawn to the Nation of Islam, which sustained him spiritually and socially. In 1964, he earned the right to challenge Liston. Both fighters were intensely disliked by the public, with Clay slightly ahead on points. The fight was viewed as a dangerous mismatch and there were real fears that Clay would be seriously injured. At the weigh-in he worked himself into such hysteria that his pulse rose from 54 to 120 beats a minute: 'I'm ready to rumble now! I can beat you any time, chump! Somebody's gonna die at ringside tonight! I am a great performer! You're too ugly! You are a bear! You're a chump, a chump, a chump,' he ranted. </p> <p>At the end of round four, Ali began screaming that he had a burning sensation in his eyes: Liston's corner had rubbed an ointment of some description on his gloves in order to blind Ali. Ali sat on his stool demanding that the fight be stopped; Angelo Dundee, his trainer, sent him back out. Ali boxed the fifth round almost blind, then recovered his sight and began to dominate. Liston retired after the sixth round, claiming a shoulder injury. </p> <p>The rematch in 1965 was even more controversial. Halfway through the first round, Liston fell to the canvas; there had been a vague movement from Ali but no visible punch. The angle of the shot in the video record of the fight makes it impossible to determine whether the knockout was the result of a perfectly timed punch or of a word whispered in Liston's ear before the fight by the Mafia or the Nation of Islam. </p> <p>More than any other sportsman, the boxer lives his life in a series of intense exposures. But as soon as a punch is translated into prose, its force is severely diminished. Attempts to represent the impact of a fist on the temple or nose, and the physical and psychological effect this has on the boxer, have led to a whole school of waffle. Remnick captures the seedy machismo of the downtown gym while at the same time expressing a sense of innocent wonder at the achievements of these freakishly gifted men. He is conscious of boxing's literary tradition and is at pains to distance himself from those among his predecessors whose writing appears to be the product of an unholy union between Papa Hemingway and the features editor of Euro Boy. Neither does he fall entirely into the boxing-as-metaphor school, as favoured by macho liberals, who use boxing as a way of running with the homeboys without having to leave the safety of their desks. </p> <p>There's a convenient ambivalence in those who look for deeper meaning in boxing. If their chosen hero prevails, they can nail their colours to his mast; if he self-destructs, an instrument is created with which to chart the demise of the American dream. The boxing world's association with organised crime, drugs and race inspires dark feelings and is an element of the harsh romance that white writers pursue with black ghetto life. In contrast, the relationship British heavyweight champions have enjoyed with the nation has been - superficially at least - far more harmonious. From Our 'Enry through Gary Mason and Big Frank Bruno (but not Joe Bugner, who was Hungarian, refused to play the game and was disliked by all on both counts) the cult of the deferential, smiling bruiser still holds sway. We expect our fighters to behave like Sergeant Paine in The Third Man who punches the drunk Holly Martins to the floor before picking him up and dusting him down, all under the approving eye of his commanding officer. </p> <p>Issues of race and class form a second narrative strain in Remnick's book, which recalls incidents from boxing's racist past, as when the great Jack Johnson entered the ring to chants of 'Kill the nigger!' Ali's antics caused a sort of panic, disguised as abhorrence of his undignified behaviour. The conservative fight establishment still held Joe 'He's a credit to his race, the human race' Louis up as the yardstick by which to judge behaviour outside the ring. Ali drove a pink bus with 'The World's Most Colourful Fighter' painted on its side, while turning from the wheel to lecture his travelling companions; he ambushed Sonny Liston at his house in the middle of the night (Liston's greeting a pithy, 'What you want, you black motherfucker?'); he was given to manic outbursts of verse. In almost every way, he flew in the face of what was to be expected from a black man. The old order's failure to come to terms with the new was well illustrated by the differing reactions of Liston and Ali on encountering the Beatles. The Louisville Lip engaged in cool banter with John and Ringo. Liston's reaction, like his boxing style, was rather blunt. 'Are those the motherfuckers that everyone's been talking about?' he asked when he saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show. 'My dog plays drums better than the kid with the big nose.' </p> <p>After he'd beaten Liston, Ali officially proclaimed his adherence to Islam - or rather, the Nation of Islam. It was Malcolm X's view that the Nation manipulated Ali, just as other boxers were manipulated by other pressure groups, but the bravery he showed in refusing to go to Vietnam, for example, is not in doubt. With an IQ of 78 he was initially classified as unfit to serve in the Army. It was only when the conflict escalated that standards were lowered sufficiently to make him eligible for active service. Thanks to a ruling by the Supreme Court he didn't serve any of his prison sentence but he was stripped of his titles, lost his licence to box in America and was placed under surveillance by the FBI. On the other hand, his substantive contribution to black politics was much less than is frequently asserted. More generally, his physical achievements have come to be seen as conscious political acts, just as his good looks were somehow taken as evidence of moral stature. This is not to dismiss his significance - he attracted enormous attention to the black cause - but Remnick allows him to overshadow the period in which he rose to prominence. Like the rest of us, he is mesmerised, and with good reason: watch footage from the fights - Ali's wide eyes, the impact of his punch - and just for a second, between the flashes of ringside cameras and the wreaths of cigar smoke, it's impossible not to see this heroic prodigy as the embodiment of hope and freedom. Here, though, is the difficulty: the phenomenon of Ali is inseparably tied to physical prowess. Boxing is a visceral, visual experience akin to dancing or bullfighting. You have to see Ali to understand his impact in and out of the ring. The photographs in Muhammad Ali: Ringside go some way to illustrating the hold he has over many people. Each one is a devotional tableau, with an essay in tribute printed alongside. The essays themselves (all reprints) are the full hagiographic shilling, written by the usual suspects - Mailer, Alex Haley, Joyce Carol Oates - but the pictures do manage to convey something of Ali's tremendous physical presence. </p> <p>Take the picture on page 17. In it, Ali is wearing a white towelling dressing-gown and is baring his teeth, his top lip tucked up Jimmy Cagney style. His expression is a combination of manic elation and apprehension. He exudes a barely controlled, barely understood humour, but no aggression. A man is standing behind him, his face obscured, his arms wrapped around Ali, whether to restrain or protect him. Ali is pointing to someone off camera and in his eyes I imagine I can see the relief of a child who has been saved from himself. This childishness was carried over with destructive effect into the ring, where punches of massive force were flicked from his body without any apparent effort, in comparison with the jarring haymakers thrown by Liston or, later, Joe Frazier. </p> <p>In another photograph from the same decade, Sonny Liston stands square on to the camera, on the scales at a weigh-in. We are drawn to his massive biceps, trapeziuses and hands like shovels. Around him stand his disciples and members of his entourage, staring at the scales. Some are wearing pork-pie hats, others thin black ties or sunglasses. Liston's eyes look downwards and to the side: he is staring at an intruder, at Ali, whose head and torso are poking through the forest of bodies. He, too, is examining the scales but with an altogether different expression on his face, the overly sincere look of the practical joker. Liston's face shows wariness and bafflement in equal measure and, below the surface, the aggression of a king insulted in his own court. </p> <p>Remnick does not deal with the subsequent 20 years of Ali's career: with the fights of the 1970s - the 'Rumble in the Jungle' and the 'Thrilla in Manila'. His fights against Frazier were in fact the zenith of his career and he was never the same after them. The later, farcical fights that proved so disastrous for his health do not figure, nor does the change in the public's perception of him, as the uppity nigger who became a symbol of global peace. By the end of his career, Ali had fought 61 professional fights, of which he won 56 and lost five. He had won the world heavyweight championship three times. </p> <p>Remnick's triumvirate continue to fulfil their allotted roles right to the end of the book. Ali was still the non-pareil who performed magic tricks and played practical jokes when Remnick went to interview him in Atlanta in 1996, an autumnal encounter well described in Remnick's wistful, adulatory prose. Sonny Liston meanwhile, after working as an enforcer and declining as a boxer, was found dead in his bedroom in January 1971. The police discovered a small amount of marijuana, heroin and a syringe; a revolver and a glass of vodka stood next to his bed. The post-mortem recorded the presence of heroin in the body. The most common theory is that a contract killer, possibly a policeman, gave him a lethal dose of the drug. In 1996, his spiritual successor, Iron Mike Tyson, laid flowers on his grave at the Paradise Memorial Gardens, Las Vegas. </p> <p>Floyd Patterson retired from boxing in 1972. In 1995, he was appointed to a sinecure as the head of the New York State Athletic Commission. In 1998, he gave evidence in legal proceedings concerning 'ultimate fighting', a hybrid of brawling and martial arts that is banned in New York. He was cross-examined by counsel for the promoters of the sport and could not remember whom he had fought for the heavyweight title, the names of his fellow commissioners or even the telephone number of his office. Patterson resigned, devastated. He had once again failed the establishment whose acceptance he had always sought. </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

He is conscious of boxing's literary tradition and is at pains to distance himself from those among his predecessors whose writing appears to be the product of an unholy union between Papa Hemingway and the features editor of Euro Boy. Neither does he fall entirely into the boxing-as-metaphor school, as favoured by macho liberals, who use boxing as a way of running with the homeboys without having to leave the safety of their desks. There's a convenient ambivalence in those who look for deeper meaning in boxing. If their chosen hero prevails, they can nail their colours to his mast; if he self-destructs, an instrument is created with which to chart the demise of the American dream. The boxing world's association with organised crime, drugs and race inspires dark feelings and is an element of the harsh romance that white writers pursue with black ghetto life. In contrast, the relationship British heavyweight champions have enjoyed with the nation has been - superficially at least - far more harmonious. From Our 'Enry through Gary Mason and Big Frank Bruno (but not Joe Bugner, who was Hungarian, refused to play the game and was disliked by all on both counts) the cult of the deferential, smiling bruiser still holds sway. We expect our fighters to behave like Sergeant Paine in The Third Man who punches the drunk Holly Martins to the floor before picking him up and dusting him down, all under the approving eye of his commanding officer. Issues of race and class form a second narrative strain in Remnick's book, which recalls incidents from boxing's racist past, as when the great Jack Johnson entered the ring to chants of 'Kill the nigger!' Ali's antics caused a sort of panic, disguised as abhorrence of his undignified behaviour. The conservative fight establishment still held Joe 'He's a credit to his race, the human race' Louis up as the yardstick by which to judge behaviour outside the ring. Ali drove a pink bus with 'The World's Most Colourful Fighter' painted on its side, while turning from the wheel to lecture his travelling companions; he ambushed Sonny Liston at his house in the middle of the night (Liston's greeting a pithy, 'What you want, you black motherfucker?'); he was given to manic outbursts of verse. In almost every way, he flew in the face of what was to be expected from a black man. The old order's failure to come to terms with the new was well illustrated by the differing reactions of Liston and Ali on encountering the Beatles. The Louisville Lip engaged in cool banter with John and Ringo. Liston's reaction, like his boxing style, was rather blunt. 'Are those the motherfuckers that everyone's been talking about?' he asked when he saw them on the Ed Sullivan Show. 'My dog plays drums better than the kid with the big nose.' After he'd beaten Liston, Ali officially proclaimed his adherence to Islam - or rather, the Nation of Islam. It was Malcolm X's view that the Nation manipulated Ali, just as other boxers were manipulated by other pressure groups, but the bravery he showed in refusing to go to Vietnam, for example, is not in doubt. With an IQ of 78 he was initially classified as unfit to serve in the Army. It was only when the conflict escalated that standards were lowered sufficiently to make him eligible for active service. Thanks to a ruling by the Supreme Court he didn't serve any of his prison sentence but he was stripped of his titles, lost his licence to box in America and was placed under surveillance by the FBI. On the other hand, his substantive contribution to black politics was much less than is frequently asserted. More generally, his physical achievements have come to be seen as conscious political acts, just as his good looks were somehow taken as evidence of moral stature. This is not to dismiss his significance - he attracted enormous attention to the black cause - but Remnick allows him to overshadow the period in which he rose to prominence. Like the rest of us, he is mesmerised, and with good reason: watch footage from the fights - Ali's wide eyes, the impact of his punch - and just for a second, between the flashes of ringside cameras and the wreaths of cigar smoke, it's impossible not to see this heroic prodigy as the embodiment of hope and freedom. Here, though, is the difficulty: the phenomenon of Ali is inseparably tied to physical prowess. Boxing is a visceral, visual experience akin to dancing or bullfighting. You have to see Ali to understand his impact in and out of the ring. The photographs in Muhammad Ali: Ringside go some way to illustrating the hold he has over many people. Each one is a devotional tableau, with an essay in tribute printed alongside. The essays themselves (all reprints) are the full hagiographic shilling, written by the usual suspects - Mailer, Alex Haley, Joyce Carol Oates - but the pictures do manage to convey something of Ali's tremendous physical presence. Take the picture on page 17. In it, Ali is wearing a white towelling dressing-gown and is baring his teeth, his top lip tucked up Jimmy Cagney style. His expression is a combination of manic elation and apprehension. He exudes a barely controlled, barely understood humour, but no aggression. A man is standing behind him, his face obscured, his arms wrapped around Ali, whether to restrain or protect him. Ali is pointing to someone off camera and in his eyes I imagine I can see the relief of a child who has been saved from himself. This childishness was carried over with destructive effect into the ring, where punches of massive force were flicked from his body without any apparent effort, in comparison with the jarring haymakers thrown by Liston or, later, Joe Frazier. In another photograph from the same decade, Sonny Liston stands square on to the camera, on the scales at a weigh-in. We are drawn to his massive biceps, trapeziuses and hands like shovels. Around him stand his disciples and members of his entourage, staring at the scales. Some are wearing pork-pie hats, others thin black ties or sunglasses. Liston's eyes look downwards and to the side: he is staring at an intruder, at Ali, whose head and torso are poking through the forest of bodies. He, too, is examining the scales but with an altogether different expression on his face, the overly sincere look of the practical joker. Liston's face shows wariness and bafflement in equal measure and, below the surface, the aggression of a king insulted in his own court. Remnick does not deal with the subsequent 20 years of Ali's career: with the fights of the 1970s - the 'Rumble in the Jungle' and the 'Thrilla in Manila'. His fights against Frazier were in fact the zenith of his career and he was never the same after them. The later, farcical fights that proved so disastrous for his health do not figure, nor does the change in the public's perception of him, as the uppity nigger who became a symbol of global peace. By the end of his career, Ali had fought 61 professional fights, of which he won 56 and lost five. He had won the world heavyweight championship three times. Remnick's triumvirate continue to fulfil their allotted roles right to the end of the book. Ali was still the non-pareil who performed magic tricks and played practical jokes when Remnick went to interview him in Atlanta in 1996, an autumnal encounter well described in Remnick's wistful, adulatory prose. Sonny Liston meanwhile, after working as an enforcer and declining as a boxer, was found dead in his bedroom in January 1971. The police discovered a small amount of marijuana, heroin and a syringe; a revolver and a glass of vodka stood next to his bed. The post-mortem recorded the presence of heroin in the body. The most common theory is that a contract killer, possibly a policeman, gave him a lethal dose of the drug. In 1996, his spiritual successor, Iron Mike Tyson, laid flowers on his grave at the Paradise Memorial Gardens, Las Vegas. Floyd Patterson retired from boxing in 1972. In 1995, he was appointed to a sinecure as the head of the New York State Athletic Commission. In 1998, he gave evidence in legal proceedings concerning 'ultimate fighting', a hybrid of brawling and martial arts that is banned in New York. He was cross-examined by counsel for the promoters of the sport and could not remember whom he had fought for the heavyweight title, the names of his fellow commissioners or even the telephone number of his office. Patterson resigned, devastated. He had once again failed the establishment whose acceptance he had always sought. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "body": "<p>The sly, cruel sorcerer of the modern children's story, Roald Dahl, reached from beyond the grave yesterday to beat Harry Potter's creator JK Rowling in a big poll for Britain's favourite author. </p> <p>Ten years after his death, Dahl's control freak magicians and big, friendly giant won 4.5% of a nationwide vote by 40,000 people for World Book Day. </p> <p>Rowling, who also deals in wizards, got 3.5% - seen as an exceptional achievement for a writer who has only produced three books, though these have dominated bestseller lists for the last year. </p> <p>But the most remarkable coup was by Jane Austen as the only classic writer to reach the top 10. She came eighth, ahead of Dick Francis, the world's bestselling horror writer Stephen King, Danielle Steele, Tolkien, Wilbur Smith and John Grisham. </p> <p>The poll was carried out at 4,000 bookshops and libraries, in schools and on the web. Its results were heavily slewed towards parental and children's book purchases and the book-buying tastes of young people. </p> <p>If only adult votes had been counted, Austen - helped by television adaptations including a shot of Colin Firth in wet, semi-transparent underclothes - would have come fourth. </p> <p>Among adults alone, the top three were Catherine Cookson, Terry Pratchett and Maeve Binchy. Dick Francis's horse-racing mysteries were fifth. </p> <p>In the poll counting both adults and children, Pratchett was third and Cookson, who died in 1998, fourth.

      "bodyText": "The sly, cruel sorcerer of the modern children's story, Roald Dahl, reached from beyond the grave yesterday to beat Harry Potter's creator JK Rowling in a big poll for Britain's favourite author. Ten years after his death, Dahl's control freak magicians and big, friendly giant won 4.5% of a nationwide vote by 40,000 people for World Book Day. Rowling, who also deals in wizards, got 3.5% - seen as an exceptional achievement for a writer who has only produced three books, though these have dominated bestseller lists for the last year. But the most remarkable coup was by Jane Austen as the only classic writer to reach the top 10. She came eighth, ahead of Dick Francis, the world's bestselling horror writer Stephen King, Danielle Steele, Tolkien, Wilbur Smith and John Grisham. The poll was carried out at 4,000 bookshops and libraries, in schools and on the web. Its results were heavily slewed towards parental and children's book purchases and the book-buying tastes of young people. If only adult votes had been counted, Austen - helped by television adaptations including a shot of Colin Firth in wet, semi-transparent underclothes - would have come fourth. Among adults alone, the top three were Catherine Cookson, Terry Pratchett and Maeve Binchy. Dick Francis's horse-racing mysteries were fifth. In the poll counting both adults and children, Pratchett was third and Cookson, who died in 1998, fourth. However the survey reported signs that the popularity of her stoical working class and lower middle class novels about the north east is beginning to slip among younger adult readers; an ominous trend, if continued, for the memory of an earnest author who hoped to be remembered as a serious mainstream writer. In this overall poll, Jacque line Wilson was fifth, Binchy sixth, Francis eighth, King ninth and Steele tenth. They were followed by Tolkien, RL Stine, Charles Dickens, Wilbur Smith and Patricia Cornwell. Stine's high place emphasises the playground popularity of the jokey, gore-filled work of a 53-year-old New Yorker who is little publicised in the British book trade. Earlier this year he emerged from another survey as the author most borrowed from British secondary school libraries - beating Dahl and Rowling. The two favourite children's writers of the post-second world war generation, Enid Blyton and CS Lewis, creator of the Narnia stories, came 17th and 24th in the overall survey. Nearly 40 years after his death, Lewis was only one ranking below Agatha Christie. Blyton and Lewis remained ahead of a clutch of more recent high sellers including Joanna Trollope, Patrick O'Brian, Ruth Rendell, Jack Higgins, Mary Higgins Clark and Ellis Peters in the top 40. Apart from Austen and Dickens, only five classic authors made the top 50. They were Thomas Hardy (19th), George Orwell (44th), Graham Greene (45th), PG Wodehouse (48th) and Shakespeare (50th).

From the UK,\" said another. \"Britain only has two yards of sufficient size to build such a vessel - Harland and Wolff and Kvaerner Govan in Glasgow - and frankly they are on their last legs,\" said Staunton-Lambert, a member of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects. \"They do not have the track record for building vessels of this type and Chantiers de l'Atlantique does. Everybody is struggling to survive and it cannot be a great surprise that the yard with the expertise won.\" Chantiers de l'Atlantique, formerly a state-owned yard which was sold to engineering giant Alstom, was turned into a viable concern after stringent \"rationalisation\" or job cuts. The French company also has an American arm - Marine Service Partners based in Miami - which provides maintenance and sells expertise to US cruise companies.",

If they can't get the big boys to sign up, they are going to have to spend a lot of money trying to get the one and two-office firms. However, I suspect the smaller firms would far rather be on our portal.\"",

The mother of her 22-year-old victim wept at the back of the high court in Aberdeen as Pamela Gourlay, 20, was sentenced, with the judge recommending she serve a minimum of 14 years. </p> <p>\"You are an evil young woman indeed,\" Lord Marnoch told Gourlay, a cafe bar chef. \"To put on rubber gloves, arm yourself with a knife and then burst in on a neighbour and slit her throat in the course of a sustained attack all for the sake of some 20 or 30 pounds and some personal items is a crime of unequivocal depravity.\" </p> <p>The jury took 4 hours and 40 minutes to reach the majority verdict, and rejected Gourlay's defence that the killing had been committed by her then boyfriend, Kris Taylor, 24. </p> <p>He denied having any involvement in the murder and was called as a crown witness. </p> <p>Melanie Sturton, 22, who worked at an old people's home run by nuns, was murdered on a Saturday morning last October after Gourlay had said goodbye to her boyfriend, who had spent the night at her bedsit. </p> <p>Gourlay went downstairs to where Miss Sturton lived and stabbed her and slit her throat before robbing her. </p> <p>Miss Sturton was found lying face down in her blood-soaked pyjamas by police officers the following Monday after she failed to turn up as expected at the family home in Deeside. </p> <p>Officers who searched Gourlay's flat found a kitchen knife with blood on it, a pair of rubber surgical gloves and bloodstained clothes. </p> <p><b>Farming 'threat to river life'</b></p> <p>A purge on Britain's intensive farming methods which were throttling the life out of rivers and streams was demanded by government freshwater fisheries advisers in a report yesterday. </p> <p>They called for tougher action against pollution through agricultural pesticides, the phasing out of many sheep dips, and grants to encourage farmers to stop livestock tramping down the banks of watercourses. </p> <p>They suggested new environmental courts might be needed to impose penalties. New methods of combating salmon poaching - which would include every carcass offered for sale having to be tagged - were proposed. </p> <p>The salmon and freshwater fisheries review group also called on the government to promote angling, especially among the young, an appeal quickly endorsed by the countryside minister, Elliot Morley. </p> <p>But the chairwoman, Lynda Warren, of the university of Wales, Aberystwyth, said animal welfare issues had not been considered. </p> <p>The advisers made clear that government moves to reward farmers who embarked on eco-friendly farming methods went nowhere near far enough, and contrasted the \u00a332m paid to just four opera and ballet companies in 1998-99 with the \u00a33.2m set aside for fisheries work in England next year. </p> <p>The advisers also recommended controls on eel and salmon fishing, tighter rules to prevent new building damaging flood plains and a rule that new dams must include fish runs. - James Meikle </p> <p><b>Kidnapping raises fears for peace</b></p> <p>Police on both sides of the Irish border were last night hunting a 22-year-old man abducted from a house in Armagh in an operation which appeared to be a paramilitary kidnap. </p> <p>The RUC admitted it was increasingly concerned for the safety of Mark Kelly. </p> <p>Five masked men grabbed Mr Kelly just before mid night on Wednesday. He was bundled into a white Ford Transit and driven away at speed. </p> <p>His family was refusing all requests for interviews last night.

They think it was heading towards Monaghan. </p> <p>Mr Kelly was standing outside a house in Greenpark Manor, a middle class area, when the masked gang struck. Neighbours were yesterday unable to throw much light on the incident and said they knew little about Mr Kelly. </p> <p>If the IRA proves to be responsible, it will be a serious blow to the peace process.

The only injuries were burns but the most telling was a tiny, precise burn mark to the urinary opening of the penis. </p> <p>Mr Crompton told the court that, in his opinion, a stream of urine hitting electricity was the only way this type of injury could be caused. </p> <p>The alcohol level present was 198mg - more than twice the drink-drive limit - and it was likely Mr Akrami was drunk. </p> <p>The jury returned a verdict of misadventure. </p> <p>The case was reconvened yesterday after an adjournment on Tuesday to allow relatives to examine CCTV footage of Mr Akrami on the station platform. </p> <p><b>Woman banker wins payout</b></p> <p>A former City banker has agreed a secret settlement after winning a claim of unfair dismissal from her \u00a3300,000-a-year job. </p> <p>Speculation last night suggested that the deal could be worth up to \u00a31m. </p> <p>Kay Swinburne, 32, who was falsely accused by a manager at Deutsche Bank of sleeping with a client, agreed the settlement.

Linus Gregoriadis Helicopter accident kills soldier A woman soldier serving with the army on a peace-keeping mission in the Balkans has been killed after stepping into the blades of a helicopter on the day she was due to return home to Britain. Lance Corporal Katie Tranter, 19, from Sutton Coldrield, was leaving a Lynx helicopter at the airport in Split, Croatia, when she was struck by the rear rotor blade. Ms Tranter, who had been serving with the Signals Regiment since December, had been flown from Bosnia to Croatia on February 24 before a transfer flight back to Britain. She was brought back to Birmingham for treatment but died in hospital. A spokesman for the ministry of defence confirmed that she was caught in the helicopter's tail rotor blade. Her 55-year-old father, Roy Cutts, said he and his former partner, Jo Tranter, were \"absolutely shattered\" by the accident. Their daughter will be buried today. Mr Cutts said: \"She lived life to the full and speaking as her father, I think she was a beautiful girl. \"She had been going on about joining the army for a few years and when she left school in 1997 she did sign up.\" The ministry of defence has launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding her death.

Mr Bondevik of the Christian Democrats said he would deliver his formal resignation to King Harald. \"I will also advise his majesty to approach the parliamentary leader of the largest party, Labour's Jens Stoltenberg [about forming a new government],\" he added. Mr Bondevik had staked the three-party government he formed in 1997 on a dispute with the parliamentary majority over a move which he claimed would weaken Norway's environmental laws. The government, with 42 seats in the 165-member parliament, opposed proposals to build electrical power plants to burn some of Norway's vast natural gas supplies. The country derives virtually all its electricity from clean hydroelectric plants, and the Bondevik government wanted to postpone natural gas plants until new technology could make them pollution free. Parliament's majority - led by Labour and Conservatives in an uneasy alliance - wants work on the plants to start immediately, even if means amending the country's strict anti-pollution laws to allow carbon dioxide emissions. In a last-ditch effort to save the government, Mr Bondevik, who is a Lutheran clergyman, said he could accept parliament's will if it would pass his additional resolution guaranteeing that any changes would not weaken Norway's overall environmental legislation.

Mothers of children aged three or under spend up to 84 hours a week on housework, but a man's quota is not affected by his children's age. Mothers spend around 14 hours a week cooking (valued at \u00a36), compared with fathers' four hours, and 21 hours washing and ironing (\u00a35.60), compared with eight and a half hours for men. Mothers clean for 13 hours a week (\u00a34.90) compared with their husbands' four hours and women spend about an hour sewing (\u00a35.10) compared with 10 minutes for men.

His refusal to clear up the origin of party funds is in blatant defiance of a law which his own government introduced. And it has won him the enmity of many previously loyal supporters among the Christian Democrats.</p> <p>Mr Kohl denied he was trying to buy back popularity and influence. \"I see no reason to have to make up with the party,\" he said. \"I'm trying to right my mistake. I was and am still in the party. It's my political home.\"</p> <p>Though several Christian Democrat MPs have called on him to give up his seat in parliament, the former chancellor said he had no intention of doing so.</p> <p>His latest collection came under attack from the ruling Social Democrats. \"He is trying to shirk responsibility by having third persons fund his breach of the law,\" said the MP Frank Hofmann.</p> <p>His successor as leader of the CDU, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said the party welcomed all contributions. But, with one eye on the critics, he added: \"[The] loss of credibility cannot be redressed with money alone.\"</p> <p>Support for Germany's conservatives has slumped since the scandal broke, though they put up a creditable showing in the regional election in Schleswig-Holstein last month. Mr Kohl's latest - entirely legal - venture into fundraising should strengthen his behind-the-scenes influence on the party he led for 25 years. But his clout will be tested in the coming weeks as the CDU prepares to choose a new leader, and the signs are that other interests will prevail.</p> <p>Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who was also caught up in the scandal, will give up the leadership next month. Last weekend one of the main contenders for the leadership, the former defence minister Volker R\u00fche, ruled himself out, leaving the field apparently clear for the party's general secretary, Angela Merkel.</p> <p>Though a former favourite of Mr Kohl's, Ms Merkel was the first senior party official to openly disown him after the scandal broke. She is not liked by the wing of the party that remains loyal to the former chancellor, but polls have shown that she is the preferred choice of most of the rank and file.</p> <p>On Wednesday she won the valuable endorsement of the CDU's new parliamentary leader, Friedrich Merz.</p> <p>Although the amount of the fine has yet to be set for his party's illegal funding, the law allows for a figure of up to three times the amount found to have been kept off the books. The CDU is expecting to have to pay about \u00a32m.</p> <p>The former chancellor said he was confident he could raise the entire amount by the time the CDU meets in conference next month.</p> <p>A much bigger penalty of \u00a312.8m has already been imposed for illegal fundraising by a regional branch of the party from Hesse. Earlier this week the CDU began an appeal.</p>",

Mr Kohl denied he was trying to buy back popularity and influence. \"I see no reason to have to make up with the party,\" he said. \"I'm trying to right my mistake. I was and am still in the party. It's my political home.\" Though several Christian Democrat MPs have called on him to give up his seat in parliament, the former chancellor said he had no intention of doing so. His latest collection came under attack from the ruling Social Democrats. \"He is trying to shirk responsibility by having third persons fund his breach of the law,\" said the MP Frank Hofmann. His successor as leader of the CDU, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said the party welcomed all contributions. But, with one eye on the critics, he added: \"[The] loss of credibility cannot be redressed with money alone.\" Support for Germany's conservatives has slumped since the scandal broke, though they put up a creditable showing in the regional election in Schleswig-Holstein last month. Mr Kohl's latest - entirely legal - venture into fundraising should strengthen his behind-the-scenes influence on the party he led for 25 years. But his clout will be tested in the coming weeks as the CDU prepares to choose a new leader, and the signs are that other interests will prevail. Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who was also caught up in the scandal, will give up the leadership next month. Last weekend one of the main contenders for the leadership, the former defence minister Volker R\u00fche, ruled himself out, leaving the field apparently clear for the party's general secretary, Angela Merkel. Though a former favourite of Mr Kohl's, Ms Merkel was the first senior party official to openly disown him after the scandal broke. She is not liked by the wing of the party that remains loyal to the former chancellor, but polls have shown that she is the preferred choice of most of the rank and file. On Wednesday she won the valuable endorsement of the CDU's new parliamentary leader, Friedrich Merz. Although the amount of the fine has yet to be set for his party's illegal funding, the law allows for a figure of up to three times the amount found to have been kept off the books. The CDU is expecting to have to pay about \u00a32m. The former chancellor said he was confident he could raise the entire amount by the time the CDU meets in conference next month. A much bigger penalty of \u00a312.8m has already been imposed for illegal fundraising by a regional branch of the party from Hesse. Earlier this week the CDU began an appeal.",

It is the difference between Starbucks, which has attracted plenty of positive publicity for funding good causes, and European companies such as CafeDirect or Percol which espouse \"fair trade\", aiming to leave the coffee growers with more money in the first place. Similarly, it is more important for drinks companies to stop getting people drunk than to fund charities which help alcoholics; more important for a lottery operator to avoid getting people hooked than to support organisa tions helping those with gambling problems; better for toy manufacturers to curb advertising to children than to give away products to toddler groups. Money is important - especially to the charities on the receiving end. But the most progressive companies are looking at their community responsibility in their marketing, their recruitment, their trading practices. A company pursuing what the chancellor described as \"civic patriotism\" should be examining all their business practices, from the way they buy products and materials to the way they reward executives. And a chancellor looking for ways to support communities might look at tax breaks for investing to create sustainable communities, not just handouts for a temporary reprieve. \u0095 Roger Cowe writes on business and society",

The exercise was staged in Merthyr Tydfil, where more than a third of reported crime last year was car related. South Wales police joined other emergency services and a local youth group to hammer home the message to 10 boys and girls aged 14 to 17 as part of a project involving young people identified as actual or potential car thieves. The youngsters were being taken by minibus on what they were told was an outing to an outdoor activity centre when they saw fire, police and ambulance officers battling to save what appeared to be four casualties from a head-on collision between an Alfa Romeo and an Austin Montego. Police said the teenagers were told that the accident was faked for their benefit and that they should ask questions and learn from the incident. However, Simon Hunt, 32, who works for Merthyr Tydfil's Oasis youth project, acknowledged that some of the group had been upset at what they saw, but counsellors and youth workers had been on hand to give support. \"It was done to highlight the fact that so-called joyriding is leading to the deaths of young people and has a devastating effect on families.

But to the asylum seekers, begging from the shoppers, workers and tourists, Anton is a prime asset. He brings the sympathy of passers by and more of their loose change. Because of this, Anton is passed around as a beggar's aid.</p> <p>Yesterday Anton was at work on the streets again. So were countless other babies and young children that accompany the city's refugee beggars. They were joined by three children, all under the age of 10, playing accordion along the busy Oxford Street pavements.</p> <p>Among Anton's minders were a number of groups of women, all Romany, and all wearing their distinctive outfits of scarves, long skirts, bright coats and all with children. Instead of sitting asking for money, they walked right up to pedestrians, put their hand out for money then motioned towards their mouths.</p> <p>One young girl, who said she was called Linka, was 14 and came from Bosnia, was holding Anton, asking for cash. But when asked, she admitted that the baby she was holding was not hers. She said Anton was the child of a woman further up the road. Then she changed her mind and said he belonged the woman standing next to her.</p> <p>A moment later a boy of around 15, claimed to be the child's father and said that Linka was the child's mother and that she was his wife. Though the beggars are almost always women, their men are never very far away. Police sources said a number of men gathered in Hyde Park, central London, where they would put out food. The beggars would come to eat and leave their money there.</p> <p>As a walk up Oxford Street shows, the police are becoming increasingly concerned by the number of beggars with young children on the capital's streets. Using them this way is breaking the law.</p> <p>The problem has become so bad that police, social services, the crown prosecution service and the London boroughs are soon to hold a meeting to develop a strategy to combat the situation.</p> <p>Elsewhere in London, women walk on to the road with their children, banging on car doors as they wait at traffic lights. At the Angel in Islington, north London, the women weave in and out of the speeding vehicles, risking injury to themselves and the babies in their arms. The same happens at Euston and Baker Street in central London and at other busy spots across the city.</p> <p>Last night, commander Bob Currie, in charge of policing Westminster, said: \"Begging itself is illegal, begging with children is more serious and brings into question the welfare of the children themslves. We are working together with social services and all relevant agencies to alleviate this.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anton, at seven months old, does not appreciate why he must spend day after day on the pavements of Oxford Street in central London. But to the asylum seekers, begging from the shoppers, workers and tourists, Anton is a prime asset. He brings the sympathy of passers by and more of their loose change. Because of this, Anton is passed around as a beggar's aid. Yesterday Anton was at work on the streets again. So were countless other babies and young children that accompany the city's refugee beggars. They were joined by three children, all under the age of 10, playing accordion along the busy Oxford Street pavements. Among Anton's minders were a number of groups of women, all Romany, and all wearing their distinctive outfits of scarves, long skirts, bright coats and all with children. Instead of sitting asking for money, they walked right up to pedestrians, put their hand out for money then motioned towards their mouths. One young girl, who said she was called Linka, was 14 and came from Bosnia, was holding Anton, asking for cash. But when asked, she admitted that the baby she was holding was not hers. She said Anton was the child of a woman further up the road. Then she changed her mind and said he belonged the woman standing next to her. A moment later a boy of around 15, claimed to be the child's father and said that Linka was the child's mother and that she was his wife. Though the beggars are almost always women, their men are never very far away. Police sources said a number of men gathered in Hyde Park, central London, where they would put out food. The beggars would come to eat and leave their money there. As a walk up Oxford Street shows, the police are becoming increasingly concerned by the number of beggars with young children on the capital's streets. Using them this way is breaking the law. The problem has become so bad that police, social services, the crown prosecution service and the London boroughs are soon to hold a meeting to develop a strategy to combat the situation. Elsewhere in London, women walk on to the road with their children, banging on car doors as they wait at traffic lights. At the Angel in Islington, north London, the women weave in and out of the speeding vehicles, risking injury to themselves and the babies in their arms. The same happens at Euston and Baker Street in central London and at other busy spots across the city. Last night, commander Bob Currie, in charge of policing Westminster, said: \"Begging itself is illegal, begging with children is more serious and brings into question the welfare of the children themslves. We are working together with social services and all relevant agencies to alleviate this.\"",

The lead singer of Blur made several trips to the podium to collect awards for the best single, best video and the much-cherished prize of best band. But when Albarn got to the mic his victory speech was short and clear; his message was not about pop but politics. \"Ken Livingstone, good luck,\" he said on one occasion; \"Big up to Ken Livingstone,\" he declared on another. Livingstone received another endorsement from Fatboy Slim, who wished the (then) Labour leftwinger luck as he collected the award for Best DJ.</p> <p>Livingstone, who was in the audience, looked on with glee. \"I prefer to be here having a good laugh rather than sitting in the House of Commons listening to that lot drone on,\" he said. It was February 1 - just over a month ago but a different political age altogether. A time when Livingstone still held out hope that he could carry enough Labour party members and trade union votes to secure the official nomination and was telling everyone who would listen that if he failed within the party he would not stand outside it.</p> <p>Now he stands not only outside it, but above it in the polls and, having already been suspended and about to be expelled, beyond it in terms of censure. But with neither party machine nor an alternative organisation to back him, support of the likes of Blur and Fatboy Slim takes on a whole new significance. They are no longer the smart bombs in his phoney war against the hapless official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson, but they could well become the most potent weapons in his populist assault on New Labour.</p> <p>His line-up in the world of popular music, even at this early stage, is impressive. Along with Fatboy Slim and Albarn there are the Chemical Brothers, Pink Floyd guitarist, Dave Gilmour, as well as the expected defection of Alan McGee - who discovered Oasis - from the clutches of the maverick candidate, Malcolm Maclaren. With the actor, Neil Pearson, as his unofficial fundraising manager, comes the likelihood of further support from stage and screen - comedian Jo Brand and film director Ken Loach are already on board.</p> <p>Backing from the beautiful people is nothing new in politics. Almost since there has been pop music the stars and politicians have been in search of the kind of mutual endorsement that would boost both sales and poll ratings. It is not difficult to see why. Stars want to be taken seriously and make a stand; politicians want to broaden their appeal, particularly among the young. The love affair rarely lasts and the break-up is usually messy. Political success demands not just popularity but respectability before an electoral audience who are, on average, in their 40s; success in the pop music industry requires, for the most part, that you keep pace with the spirit of youth which, almost by definition, tends towards the rebellious and hedonistic. When invited to Downing Street with the rest of Britpop shortly after the last election, Albarn declined for precisely this reason. \"I wouldn't have dreamed of going, because you don't expect politicians to make records and pop stars shouldn't mix in politics,\" he said.</p> <p>What begins as a mutually advantageous embrace ends in mutual recrimination; what at first appears symbiotic soon becomes antagonistic. \"Ministers were in love with the bands when they all turned up at the Brit awards,\" said Craig McLean, the assistant editor of the Face. \"But as soon as it started to turn a bit rock 'n' roll, they branded them drunken layabouts. Of course they're drunken layabouts - they're pop stars. If you climb into bed with a tiger, you shouldn't be surprised if you get your bum nipped.\"</p> <p>But the alliance between pop and politics isn't simply self-serving. It usually represents a genuine confluence between popular sentiment and political expression. Harold Wilson's photo-opportunity with the Beatles was symbolic of the new modern era where the \"white heat of technology\" would transform both our economy and our culture. Billy Bragg's Red Wedge tapped into a general feeling of disenfranchisement among young Britain during the Thatcher period. Even Cool Britannia had its roots in a new beginning after 18 years of Thatcherism. Similarly Livingstone's candidacy taps into a popular mood of anti-authoritarian local politics brought about by the contradictory trends of centralisation within the Labour party and the devolution of power it has brought about.</p> <p>On one level, Livingstone's independent candidacy provides a focus for most of this frustration that had risked descending into a pit of introspective disaffection. But not all of it. \"I don't know why people think all of the anti-politician frustration is going to go to Livingstone,\" says Alice Nutter of Chumbawumba. \"At the end of the day, he's a state politician. I'd rather him than Dobson but he's not an alternative to New Labour. He's still a career politician.\"</p> <p>But Livingstone's relationship with pop music goes beyond this. As the frontrunner and the renegade, he will be attacked from every possible angle at every possible opportunity. And with less than two months to go, he has no leafletters - let alone leaflets - envelope stuffers or door knockers to defend him. Since any Labour party member who supports him will find themselves expelled from the party, he is unlikely to get help from that quarter. If proof were ever needed that his decision to run was taken very recently surely it can be found in the organisation of his campaign which is, at present risible. Of the four phone numbers available to contact his camp, two are permanently engaged, one rings off the hook and the other, a mobile phone, has so many unanswered messages on it that the voice mail politely informs you that it is full.</p> <p>Things will improve somewhat in the next week or so but the fact remains that, paradoxically given the characterisation of him as an old Labour dinosaur, his campaign will be more modern than anything Millbank has ever been involved in. The only distinctive policy that he has - funding the tube through bond issues - is shared by the Liberal Democrat candidate Susan Kramer. The genuine affection that many Londoners of all political persuasions have for him is far more about style than substance. With a great deal of help from the Labour party hierarchy, he has carefully cultivated a media-image as a likeable rogue who has been badly mistreated by party bigwigs.</p> <p>His decision to break with 30 years of personal loyalty to the Labour party was made, by his own admission, on the basis of opinion polls, emails and the comments of people he met on the street.</p> <p>He declared his decision to stand on the comment pages of the London Evening Standard. With little in the way of a press team and few footsoldiers, Livingstone will need the media, including the internet, to respond to most of his opponents' accusations. And in this context, the momentum of his campaign will hinge heavily on the number of personalities with media-recognition that he can get on board in the coming weeks. Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Brothers have already agreed to do a fundraising gig and Gilmour has also offered his services; if and when support grows among comedians and actors, so does the potential for benefit shows which raise both cash and support, and do no harm to the image of a popular insurgency.</p> <p>This alliance between the populist candidate and the world of pop is not accidental. In anticipation of his long-trailed candidacy - independent or otherwise - Livingstone has been courting the pop world since soon after the last election. \"This government will only do what it is forced to do,\" he told the NME in early 1998. In a statement that could have formed the strategy basis for his own campaign for mayor, he continued: \"If there's enough rebellion and pressure from below then they'll have to take notice - otherwise they'll just roll right over everybody. Get along there and give them some stick.\" Livingstone's relationship with Blur goes way back. As long ago as 1995 he appeared on Blur's album The Great Escape. Albarn has already spoken alongside Livingstone at a meeting in the Commons to support free higher education and at a rally late last year.</p> <p>The warm reception he received at the London School of Economics earlier this week suggests that the combination of personality and policies give him a strong appeal among the young. They call him Ken; he is a regular at National Union of Students conference; there is already a direct link between the NME's website and his own. T-shirts already exist of him as Che Guevara; it will not be long before other titbits of popular iconography start to appear on campuses and in bars. He is the natural candidate of youth. Not difficult when you consider the appeal of the other candidates. They are at best avuncular and at worst dull - Livingstone has radical cheek. (SIC)</p> <p>The government's introduction of tuition fees, its welfare-to-work scheme, a proposed curfew scheme for under-18s and hardline stance on soft drugs eroded much of the goodwill that had been built up between pop figures and the government very quickly.

      "bodyText": "Internet service providers are not charities (BT rivals scorn \u00a330 internet package, March 9). They will only provide internet access free at the point of use if somebody, somehow, is paying for it. Who will offer free internet access to users who are too poor to subscribe to other telecommunications services, or to be worth advertising to? Will service providers \"cherry pick\", competing to reward the already rich with further blandishments and concessions while punishing the poor with higher charges, just as the privatised energy suppliers did until regulators stepped in? How can the government prevent this net exclusion? Will it come under pressure to subsidise internet companies to service the less well off? Will more reliance on keyboarded text make it even harder for the less literate to hold their own in society? As a director of a knowledge-based business which, largely thanks to the internet, can now run as a \"virtual organisation\", with colleagues based where they please all over the UK and no central office, I know it's a wonderful tool for some purposes. But internet access for all will be neither as easy to achieve, nor as unalloyed a blessing, as the prime minister (with perhaps naive enthusiasm borne of relative lack of practical experience) seems to think. Roger Levett London rl@cagconsult.co.uk \u0095 I can't be alone in permitting myself a hollow laugh when reading about the current internet hyper-ventilation. I recently spent two days trying to log on to the Go website; eventually I gave up and telephoned instead, which enabled me to listen to a message that told me that the easiest way to book with Go was via their website. I flew Easyjet, booked by phone. Yesterday I wasted two hours trying to log on to thetrainline.com (sorry, maximum number of site users exceeded). I finally managed to enter my details as a \"new user\" and then attempted to access the timetable page. Result: \"sorry\".

      "body": "<p>Nato last night was forced into an embarrassing climbdown when it admitted that, contrary to earlier denials, a secret US report exists suggesting it had a spy in its ranks in the early days of the Kosovo war.</p> <p>After first denying knowledge of the report, it admitted that a senior US air force officer had carried out an internal Pentagon investigation into the vulnerability of Nato's secret \"air tasking orders\" giving daily details of allied bombing raids, including targets and reconnaissance flights.</p> <p>Jamie Shea, Nato's chief spokesman, at first insisted there was \"no evidence\" of a spy and Nato had no knowledge of the US report. Lord Robertson, Nato's secretary general, said during a visit to Ankara: \"We have no knowledge and no evidence that the air tasking order was ever leaked to the Serbs or otherwise compromised\".</p> <p>Javier Solana, Nato's secretary general during the Kosovo war, told the Guardian he had no knowledge of a spy at Nato, and had not seen any US report on the subject. He added that in one case - an attack on the town of Novi Sad - there were suspicions that Belgrade had had some prior knowledge of Nato plans.</p> <p>However, Nato officials later confirmed a report had indeed been written. A definitive \"lessons learned from Kosovo\" study had been drawn up by James McCarthy, a now retired US air force general, for the deputy secretary of defence John Hamre and general Joe Ralston, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff.</p> <p>The McCarthy report says that after Nato reduced the number of people with access to bombing raid orders from 600 to 100, the effect on what the Serbs appeared to know about Nato's plans was immediate. It says that the Serbs appeared to know when Nato spy planes and unmanned reconnaissance drones would be deployed. General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, has admitted that concern about Nato security led to particularly sensitive information being omitted from the tasking orders.</p> <p>The report was discovered by Allan Little, the BBC's foreign correspondent and reporter for a BBC2 programme, Moral Combat: Nato at War, to be broadcast on Sunday night. It was first revealed yesterday by the Guardian.</p> <p>A senior US air force source tells the programme that Gen Clark told colleagues: \"I know I've got a spy, I want to find him\".</p> <p>Yesterday, a Nato military official described General McCarthy's conclusion as based on \"circumstantial evidence\". In Washington, US air force spokesman, Lt Colonel Vic Warzinsky said that while the report provided no conclusive evidence of a spy within Nato, \"there was a sense in Nato headquarters that the Serbs were pretty well informed about what we were doing.\"</p> <p>He said Serb intelligence could have come from a number of sources, including ground spotters positioned at the end of Nato runways in Italy, passing on information to Belgrade by satellite phone on the numbers and types of aircraft being launched. The Serbs were also listening in to unscrambled radio traffic, to glean whatever indirect information they could about air force activities.</p> <p>He acknowledged that Nato targeting appeared to have become more effective after the distribution list was shortened, though he said that could have been the result of a number of different factors, including the destruction of Serb communication and command-and-control centres in the first days of the bombing campaign.</p> <p>However, diplomatic sources said the tasking orders - placed on Nato's coded computer system, called Chronos - were potentially available to thousands of people once it reached the capitals of Nato's 19 governments. \"There would be no way for anyone to know if some of it had leaked,\" said one source.</p> <p>The McCarthy report appears to have been withheld from America's Nato partners, including the British government. The ministry of defence said it intended to question Washington about the report. Senior British government sources said they had not seen it, and expressed surprise that it had taken so long to leak.</p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: \"This was the most sensitive information of all available at that time in the campaign and for 600 people to have access to it seems fairly contrary to the principle of need to know. These revelations will only serve to increase political tension within the alliance.\"</p> <p>They come as the US and the European allies are at odds over defence spending, Washington's plans for a national anti-missile defence shield, and for increased military cooperation within the EU.</p> <p>Mr Solana, the EU's security supremo, made it clear he is anxious to avoid any suggestion of problems within Nato as he advances the delicate business of trying to construct a European \"defence identity\" and capabilities that some US officials have warned will undermine the western alliance.</p> <p>Iain Duncan-Smith, the shadow defence secretary, said the disclosure \"begs the question of whether it is ever feasible to operate with all the Nato nations having access to the most sensitive information, regardless as to whether they are committed in a military sense or not\".</p> <p>He added: \"The lesson to learn is that there will always be a core that will go ahead and operate under the umbrella of Nato while others will go along politically but do not necessarily need to be kept alongside militarily, so as to avoid the temptation for them to use that information to weaken Nato.\"</p> <p>He joined Francis Maude, the the shadow foreign secretary, in calling for an inquiry into the handling of the Kosovo conflict.</p> <p><b>How the story changed</b></p> <p>We don't know of any report</p> <p>We don't know of allegations (that there is a spy)</p> <p>There is no evidence</p> <p>There is no spy</p> <p><b> Jamie Shea</b>, Nato spokesman, on BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday morning.</p> <p>Yes there is a report by a US air force general</p> <p>There is a claim of espionage</p> <p>The evidence is circumstantial</p> <p>There is no spy</p> <p><b> Nato military official</b>, quoted on Reuters six hours later</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nato last night was forced into an embarrassing climbdown when it admitted that, contrary to earlier denials, a secret US report exists suggesting it had a spy in its ranks in the early days of the Kosovo war. After first denying knowledge of the report, it admitted that a senior US air force officer had carried out an internal Pentagon investigation into the vulnerability of Nato's secret \"air tasking orders\" giving daily details of allied bombing raids, including targets and reconnaissance flights. Jamie Shea, Nato's chief spokesman, at first insisted there was \"no evidence\" of a spy and Nato had no knowledge of the US report. Lord Robertson, Nato's secretary general, said during a visit to Ankara: \"We have no knowledge and no evidence that the air tasking order was ever leaked to the Serbs or otherwise compromised\". Javier Solana, Nato's secretary general during the Kosovo war, told the Guardian he had no knowledge of a spy at Nato, and had not seen any US report on the subject. He added that in one case - an attack on the town of Novi Sad - there were suspicions that Belgrade had had some prior knowledge of Nato plans. However, Nato officials later confirmed a report had indeed been written. A definitive \"lessons learned from Kosovo\" study had been drawn up by James McCarthy, a now retired US air force general, for the deputy secretary of defence John Hamre and general Joe Ralston, vice-chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff. The McCarthy report says that after Nato reduced the number of people with access to bombing raid orders from 600 to 100, the effect on what the Serbs appeared to know about Nato's plans was immediate. It says that the Serbs appeared to know when Nato spy planes and unmanned reconnaissance drones would be deployed. General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander, has admitted that concern about Nato security led to particularly sensitive information being omitted from the tasking orders. The report was discovered by Allan Little, the BBC's foreign correspondent and reporter for a BBC2 programme, Moral Combat: Nato at War, to be broadcast on Sunday night. It was first revealed yesterday by the Guardian. A senior US air force source tells the programme that Gen Clark told colleagues: \"I know I've got a spy, I want to find him\". Yesterday, a Nato military official described General McCarthy's conclusion as based on \"circumstantial evidence\". In Washington, US air force spokesman, Lt Colonel Vic Warzinsky said that while the report provided no conclusive evidence of a spy within Nato, \"there was a sense in Nato headquarters that the Serbs were pretty well informed about what we were doing.\" He said Serb intelligence could have come from a number of sources, including ground spotters positioned at the end of Nato runways in Italy, passing on information to Belgrade by satellite phone on the numbers and types of aircraft being launched. The Serbs were also listening in to unscrambled radio traffic, to glean whatever indirect information they could about air force activities. He acknowledged that Nato targeting appeared to have become more effective after the distribution list was shortened, though he said that could have been the result of a number of different factors, including the destruction of Serb communication and command-and-control centres in the first days of the bombing campaign. However, diplomatic sources said the tasking orders - placed on Nato's coded computer system, called Chronos - were potentially available to thousands of people once it reached the capitals of Nato's 19 governments. \"There would be no way for anyone to know if some of it had leaked,\" said one source. The McCarthy report appears to have been withheld from America's Nato partners, including the British government. The ministry of defence said it intended to question Washington about the report. Senior British government sources said they had not seen it, and expressed surprise that it had taken so long to leak. Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said: \"This was the most sensitive information of all available at that time in the campaign and for 600 people to have access to it seems fairly contrary to the principle of need to know. These revelations will only serve to increase political tension within the alliance.\" They come as the US and the European allies are at odds over defence spending, Washington's plans for a national anti-missile defence shield, and for increased military cooperation within the EU. Mr Solana, the EU's security supremo, made it clear he is anxious to avoid any suggestion of problems within Nato as he advances the delicate business of trying to construct a European \"defence identity\" and capabilities that some US officials have warned will undermine the western alliance. Iain Duncan-Smith, the shadow defence secretary, said the disclosure \"begs the question of whether it is ever feasible to operate with all the Nato nations having access to the most sensitive information, regardless as to whether they are committed in a military sense or not\". He added: \"The lesson to learn is that there will always be a core that will go ahead and operate under the umbrella of Nato while others will go along politically but do not necessarily need to be kept alongside militarily, so as to avoid the temptation for them to use that information to weaken Nato.\" He joined Francis Maude, the the shadow foreign secretary, in calling for an inquiry into the handling of the Kosovo conflict. How the story changed We don't know of any report We don't know of allegations (that there is a spy) There is no evidence There is no spy Jamie Shea, Nato spokesman, on BBC Radio 4 Today programme yesterday morning. Yes there is a report by a US air force general There is a claim of espionage The evidence is circumstantial There is no spy Nato military official, quoted on Reuters six hours later",

In doing so, the government will exceed its United Nations legally binding target of 12.5% and, as a world market develops in carbon credits, will be able to sell them to countries unable to meet their own binding pledges. </p> <p>Britain's lead in this area is partly luck, brought about because of Lady Thatcher's hatred of the miners when prime minister, causing a mass switch to gas generation - a far less polluting means of generating electricity. Britain is set to achieve a 15% reduction on 1990 levels this year mainly because of the switch to gas. </p> <p>However, increased economic activity and more traffic growth would have meant the totals rising again, except that policies adopted in the last two years are designed to maintain the downward trend, as it has become clear that climate change is accelerating and is a serious threat. </p> <p>Mr Prescott said yesterday that the UK's strategy went much further than any other country in the world in taking reduction beyond its legally binding target. \"There is no doubt that climate change is the greatest threat to the future of mankind. The floods in China and Mozambique, the damage hurricane Mitch did to central America, they are all symptoms of what we can expect as climate change takes hold. These measures we are putting in place are to save us from the worst effects of global warming.\" </p> <p>The UK's targets would allow the country to take a lead in renewed international negotiations due in the Hague in November; Mr Prescott hoped Europe would ratify the Kyoto protocol that gave binding targets to all countries, and would allow international carbon trading to begin. So far the UK had not decided whether to sell its surplus or keep it \"in the bank\", he said. Estimates vary about how much a ton of carbon will be worth in international trade but it could be as much as \u00a315. Britain will have up to 8m tonnes to sell. </p> <p>Among the initiatives announced yesterday were revised energy efficiency targets in homes.

      "bodyText": "Britain will exceed its target for reducing carbon dioxide emission by such a large amount that it will have as much as \u00a3100 million worth of carbon credits to sell to the United States or any other country that will buy to meet its legally binding target. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, said yesterday that the United Kingdom would be in the \"happy position\" of having a huge surplus of credits to trade on the world markets if the government chose to do so. He was launching the government's climate change strategy, which confirmed Britain as the world leader in fighting climate change by delivering on Labour's manifesto pledge of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% for 2010. In doing so, the government will exceed its United Nations legally binding target of 12.5% and, as a world market develops in carbon credits, will be able to sell them to countries unable to meet their own binding pledges. Britain's lead in this area is partly luck, brought about because of Lady Thatcher's hatred of the miners when prime minister, causing a mass switch to gas generation - a far less polluting means of generating electricity. Britain is set to achieve a 15% reduction on 1990 levels this year mainly because of the switch to gas. However, increased economic activity and more traffic growth would have meant the totals rising again, except that policies adopted in the last two years are designed to maintain the downward trend, as it has become clear that climate change is accelerating and is a serious threat. Mr Prescott said yesterday that the UK's strategy went much further than any other country in the world in taking reduction beyond its legally binding target. \"There is no doubt that climate change is the greatest threat to the future of mankind. The floods in China and Mozambique, the damage hurricane Mitch did to central America, they are all symptoms of what we can expect as climate change takes hold. These measures we are putting in place are to save us from the worst effects of global warming.\" The UK's targets would allow the country to take a lead in renewed international negotiations due in the Hague in November; Mr Prescott hoped Europe would ratify the Kyoto protocol that gave binding targets to all countries, and would allow international carbon trading to begin. So far the UK had not decided whether to sell its surplus or keep it \"in the bank\", he said. Estimates vary about how much a ton of carbon will be worth in international trade but it could be as much as \u00a315. Britain will have up to 8m tonnes to sell. Among the initiatives announced yesterday were revised energy efficiency targets in homes. From 2002 elderly people and families on low incomes will be helped by electricity and gas suppliers to insulate their homes. There will be an internal UK carbon trading market to encourage businesses to save carbon and sell on credits to other industries. The government has also finalised its climate change levy on industry, which is expected to be the incentive for a cut in emissions of 2.5m tonnes. The government has also given industry notice that hydrochlorofluorocarbons, the successors to chlorofluorocarbons in refrigeration, have no long term future and will be phased out, since they too are a powerful global warming gas. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said: \"The 20% cut is only the beginning. Scientists say we must cut 60% to 70% to peg the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to double what it was before the industrial revolution. We must move into renewable energies, fuel cells to drive cars, and other technologies that cause no carbon pollution.\"",

Known as a leftwinger, he had been an MP for 27 years when he retired at the last general election after a stroke and heart bypass; he was also a diabetic. Police question GP over death An unnamed family doctor from Harlow, Essex, is being questioned by police over a 17-year-old patient for whom he prescribed methadone, a heroin substitute, and who died in September 1997. His health authority has asked that he be suspended, and the General Medical Council will investigate. Crufts judge denies cruelty Caroline Gatheral, 65, an authority on King Charles spaniels, is among the judges at today's Crufts show in Birmingham. She and her sister, Mary, 63, are to stand trial in a fortnight for alleged cruelty to 83 dogs in their care, which they deny, at their kennels in a former stately home in Co Durham last year.

      "bodyText": "Edwina Currie is not the vilest woman in Britain. For those who may have been in some doubt on the matter, it was resolved yesterday in the high court in London when the novelist and former Tory minister won a public apology and \u00a330,000 in libel damages from a newspaper which had accused her of holding this special place in the nation's heart. The article, written by the Express's political columnist Peter Oborne in September 1997, had made a number of \"offensive\" allegations about the ex-Tory MP, the court heard. But it was the headline, How Edwina is now the vilest lady in Britain, which had particularly upset Mrs Currie, her counsel Edward Garnier QC said, because it could have been taken by readers to compare her unfavourably with the Moors murderer Myra Hindley and the serial killer Rosemary West. The article claimed that there were rumours sweeping Westminster that Mrs Currie was about to join the Labour party to breathe new life into her \"clapped out\" political career. Mr Oborne wrote that she would be no more acceptable to Tony Blair's inclusive new Labour administration than \"a mass murderer\", a \"serial rapist\" or \"an active officer in Radovan Karadzic's death squad\". Mrs Currie was unaware of any rumours that she was about to leave the Conservative party and they were, in any event, untrue. Other allegations in the article had been put to Mrs Currie in televison and radio interviews as though they were established facts, Mr Garnier told Mr Justice Morland. Kate Macmillan, solicitor for the newspaper, expressed \"sincere regret\" that the article had caused Mrs Currie any upset and damage. She added: \"The article and headline in particular were not meant to be taken literally but were intended to be a strong piece of political comment.\" The newspaper accepted without reservation that the headline - which was not written by Oborne - and parts of the article went beyond the acceptable ambit of fair comment. Mrs Currie, who was MP for South Derbyshire from 1983 to 1997 and a junior health minister from 1986 to 1988, also received her legal costs. Afterwards, she said: \"I'm delighted it's done and delighted it's over. I never wanted a fight with the Express.\"",

      "body": "<p>The families of two women crushed to death by a runaway bus are considering legal action against the vehicle's makers after the collapse of a dangerous driving trial yesterday.</p> <p>Crown court judge David Hodson ordered the jury at Newcastle upon Tyne to acquit 64-year-old Gordon Clifford, whose single-decker Dennis Dart careered into passengers waiting at a crowded bus station in Sunderland in December 1998.</p> <p>Mark Laprell, defending, told the jury during the nine day hearing that because of engineering tolerances the accelerator could be higher than the brake in one bus but lower in another which was otherwise an identical model.</p> <p>The mother of student teacher Janine Harrison, who was 19 and died after being dragged 200ft beneath the bus, collapsed in the public gallery after the judge made his ruling.</p> <p>The court was suspended while Lesley Harrison was taken to Newcastle royal infirmary where she was recovering last night.</p> <p>Other relatives said that they were stunned by the decision and John Anderson, whose 26-year-old wife, Nicola, also died, said: \"This is not an answer to what happened. I never expected this. We wanted answers but we haven't got any. I shall be talking to the Harrison family straight away about what steps we can take.\"</p> <p>Bus makers Dennis said last night that the company was confident of the safety of the Darts, as were the many operating companies which used it in Britain and overseas.</p> <p>A spokesman added: \"Dennis will of course be looking at every aspect of the case. This case has been distressing for all concerned and our thoughts remain with the families of those involved.\"</p> <p>But he emphasised that Judge Hodson had not accepted defence submissions that the bus was defective.</p> <p>The court had heard that Clifford's claim that his bus \"suddenly shot forward\" echoed a series of previous cases involving Dart single-deckers. Although the buses could not be described officially as defective, the judge ruled, three separate studies had suggested that the pedal positioning problem could increase the chance of accidents particularly when a driver was making a sudden or emergency stop.</p> <p>The history of unexpected power surges or unintentional acceleration had been known to Dennis for more than a decade with separate reports from the Motor Industry Research Association, the Cranfield research institute and an ergonomics company all highlighting the problem. The company said that design improvements had been made after the Mira and Cranfield reports in the early 1990s, but acknowledged that incidents continued until the Sunderland tragedy.</p> <p>Judge Hodson said that to prove the two charges of dangerous driving faced by Clifford, a Stagecoach Buses driver who lives in Monkwearmouth, near Sunderland, the prosecution had to establish that the acceleration was deliberate. The ruling concluded: \"This they have not succeded in doing. Indeed it is difficult to see how they ever could.\"</p> <p>Clifford, who had denied the charges, refused to comment after the trial. His solicitor, Jonathan Backhouse, said in a statement: \"Mr Clifford is extremely upset and distraught but wants to pass on his sympathy to the families. This is an extremely sad case in which there are only losers. Gordon's life is only a shadow of what it was prior to this accident. While his grief cannot compare to that of the families of the women involved he is still extremely sad and feels he will never recover from this.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The families of two women crushed to death by a runaway bus are considering legal action against the vehicle's makers after the collapse of a dangerous driving trial yesterday. Crown court judge David Hodson ordered the jury at Newcastle upon Tyne to acquit 64-year-old Gordon Clifford, whose single-decker Dennis Dart careered into passengers waiting at a crowded bus station in Sunderland in December 1998. Mark Laprell, defending, told the jury during the nine day hearing that because of engineering tolerances the accelerator could be higher than the brake in one bus but lower in another which was otherwise an identical model. The mother of student teacher Janine Harrison, who was 19 and died after being dragged 200ft beneath the bus, collapsed in the public gallery after the judge made his ruling. The court was suspended while Lesley Harrison was taken to Newcastle royal infirmary where she was recovering last night. Other relatives said that they were stunned by the decision and John Anderson, whose 26-year-old wife, Nicola, also died, said: \"This is not an answer to what happened. I never expected this. We wanted answers but we haven't got any. I shall be talking to the Harrison family straight away about what steps we can take.\" Bus makers Dennis said last night that the company was confident of the safety of the Darts, as were the many operating companies which used it in Britain and overseas. A spokesman added: \"Dennis will of course be looking at every aspect of the case. This case has been distressing for all concerned and our thoughts remain with the families of those involved.\" But he emphasised that Judge Hodson had not accepted defence submissions that the bus was defective. The court had heard that Clifford's claim that his bus \"suddenly shot forward\" echoed a series of previous cases involving Dart single-deckers. Although the buses could not be described officially as defective, the judge ruled, three separate studies had suggested that the pedal positioning problem could increase the chance of accidents particularly when a driver was making a sudden or emergency stop. The history of unexpected power surges or unintentional acceleration had been known to Dennis for more than a decade with separate reports from the Motor Industry Research Association, the Cranfield research institute and an ergonomics company all highlighting the problem. The company said that design improvements had been made after the Mira and Cranfield reports in the early 1990s, but acknowledged that incidents continued until the Sunderland tragedy. Judge Hodson said that to prove the two charges of dangerous driving faced by Clifford, a Stagecoach Buses driver who lives in Monkwearmouth, near Sunderland, the prosecution had to establish that the acceleration was deliberate. The ruling concluded: \"This they have not succeded in doing. Indeed it is difficult to see how they ever could.\" Clifford, who had denied the charges, refused to comment after the trial. His solicitor, Jonathan Backhouse, said in a statement: \"Mr Clifford is extremely upset and distraught but wants to pass on his sympathy to the families. This is an extremely sad case in which there are only losers. Gordon's life is only a shadow of what it was prior to this accident. While his grief cannot compare to that of the families of the women involved he is still extremely sad and feels he will never recover from this.\"",

Tyler Foster, 23 months old, was taken to the accident and emergency department at Grantham and District hospital in Lincolnshire after his mother spotted a purple rash on his neck. The child, from Gonerby Hill Foot, Lincolnshire, was transferred by ambulance to the Pilgrim hospital in Boston, because Grantham hospital does not have intensive care facilities for children. Doctors at the Pilgrim, which is also without a paediatric intensive care unit, then decided that Tyler needed to go to a third hospital in Nottingham where he could receive specialist treatment. The child, who eventually arrived at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham 10 hours after he was first taken to the Grantham hospital, died of meningococcal meningitis on February 26 after four days in intensive care. After the boy's parents complained, Grantham and District hospital yesterday said it would investigate why the decision had been taken to take the child to Boston rather than Nottingham. Sarah Temple, 27, the boy's mother, said: \"Meningitis is every mother's worst nightmare and Tyler should have been taken to the right hospital straight away.

Rowland was devastated when in July that year the crown prosecution service advised the police that there was no real prospect of a criminal conviction. Mr Fayed greeted the decision as a \"triumph for the truth\", claiming the allegations of theft had been a \"total fabrication\".</p> <p>But the matter refused to go away. It dominated the final days of Rowland's life and before he died he made his wife promise that she would go on with a civil action he had launched. The case reached the courts in November 1998. Mr Fayed admitted the safe deposit box had been broken into, but denied any involvement, claiming he had only found out afterwards. But after two weeks Mr Fayed paid costs, estimated at \u00a32m, and damages totalling \u00a3253,465, to Mrs Rowland, including \u00a32,400 for the missing cigarette case, \u00a31,000 for the Tibetan coins, \u00a3150,000 for reducing the value of Row land's archive when personal letters were copied and \u00a3100,000 special damages.</p> <p>Yesterday was the third time that the owner of Harrods has been forced to pay out a considerable sum of money in an attempt to make the allegations go away.

He claims Dodi overruled those appointed to take care of security, changed travel plans at a moment's notice and travelled without back-up.</p> <p>Mr Rees-Jones portrays Mr Fayed as a fantasist who, in order to disguise his son's culpability, invented incredible conspiracy theories involving MI5 and the British establishment.</p> <p>He also rejects the contention that the couple were intending to marry, dismissing suggestions that Dodi had bought Princess Diana an engagement ring. Mr Fayed has claimed that the couple chose a ring in Monte Carlo before their deaths, but Mr Rees-Jones, who accompanied them on the trip wrote that they \"never went into a jewellery store\".</p>",

The millionaire Egyptian businessman and three of his employees admitted liability in 1998 over the unlawful break-ins to the safe deposit box, paying Josephine Rowland more than \u00a3250,000 in damages. He is also liable for costs of the case, which are estimated at \u00a32.1m over its three-year duration. But in accordance with her husband's last wish that she should continue with the civil action to the bitter end, Mrs Rowland pursued the Harrods owner over the value of the collection of 20 emeralds, seven rubies and four tanzanite stones that were lost \"because of the wrongdoing of the defendants\". Christopher Moger QC, representing Mrs Rowland, told the high court in London yesterday that the the process of getting Mr Fayed and the other defendants to pay compensation was \"a process akin to drawing teeth\", adding: \"I would like to emphasise that this is not a settlement or a compromise. It is a submission by Mr Fayed and the other defendants for the whole of the claim.\" Mrs Rowland said yesterday that the case was not about money. \"Those stones were selected by my husband as gifts for our daughters and were a very great loss to us. My children will never be able to say these stones came from daddy's mines.\" Humiliating Of all the mud that was thrown between Mr Fayed and Mr Rowland during their 14-year feud over the control of Harrods, the safety deposit box allegations have proved to be possibly the most humiliating and damaging for the Harrods owner. His consuming passion to be granted a British passport was dealt a fatal blow by the theft claims last year when Jack Straw ruled that Mr Fayed was unfit to be given British citizenship on the grounds that he had made \"improper and unethical\" cash-for-questions payments to MPs and because of his failure to report the deposit box break-in to the police. The saga began in 1997 when a former employee of Mr Fayed, Robert Loftus, contacted Rowland and told him that on December 6 1995 he had shown a still picture taken from a closed-circuit security camera of Rowland visiting the Harrods vaults. The Harrods owner was said to be furious that his enemy had managed to keep personal belongings right under his nose and ordered his security staff to break into the safe deposit box. Bodyguard A Surrey locksmith who had been asked to perform a \"special job\" was brought to Harrods, while the deposit box manager was told not to go through the alarm procedures for the evening and leave the security cameras switched off. After the store closed Mr Loftus took the locksmith down to the safe deposit boxes where they were joined by John Macnamara, Mr Fayed's head of security, Mark Griffiths, his personal assistant, and Paul Handly-Greaves, his bodyguard. As soon as the box was opened it was taken up to Mr Fayed's office suite on the fifth floor, where, in the chairman's presence, Mr Griffiths and Mr Macnamara put on plastic food-handlers' gloves from the store's world-famous food hall and removed the contents. Rowland reported the matter to the police. He claimed the items missing from the box - rented over 30 years earlier - contained documents and mementos relating to his wartime activities, emeralds, rubies, Tibetan coins, a Tibetan stamp, a gold cigarette case and audio tapes. He alleged the items had been removed to blackmail him into falsely claiming that he had paid the former home secretary Michael Howard \u00a310m as a bribe to launch the DTI inquiry into Mr Fayed's takeover of Harrods. In March 1998 the Harrods chairman and a number of his employees suffered the indignity of being arrested and released on police bail after voluntarily going to a central London police station to be questioned about the allegations. Rowland was devastated when in July that year the crown prosecution service advised the police that there was no real prospect of a criminal conviction. Mr Fayed greeted the decision as a \"triumph for the truth\", claiming the allegations of theft had been a \"total fabrication\". But the matter refused to go away. It dominated the final days of Rowland's life and before he died he made his wife promise that she would go on with a civil action he had launched. The case reached the courts in November 1998. Mr Fayed admitted the safe deposit box had been broken into, but denied any involvement, claiming he had only found out afterwards. But after two weeks Mr Fayed paid costs, estimated at \u00a32m, and damages totalling \u00a3253,465, to Mrs Rowland, including \u00a32,400 for the missing cigarette case, \u00a31,000 for the Tibetan coins, \u00a3150,000 for reducing the value of Row land's archive when personal letters were copied and \u00a3100,000 special damages. Yesterday was the third time that the owner of Harrods has been forced to pay out a considerable sum of money in an attempt to make the allegations go away. Bob Loftus accepted \"generous\" undisclosed damages from the Harrods chairman after he accused his former security guard of instigating the opening of the box while in the pay of Mr Rowland. Latest in a week of legal setbacks Yesterday's payment to the widow of Tiny Rowland completes what has been a very bad week for Mohamed Al Fayed, the fabulously wealthy owner of Harrods. On March 3 it emerges that the City of London police have launched an investigation into allegations that Mr Fayed had paid \u00a310,000 for legal documents stolen from the dustbins of the disgraced former minister Neil Hamilton's lawyers before the start of his libel trial against the Harrods owner. The papers, allegedly taken by Benjamin Pell, are said to have contained details of the strategy to be employed by Mr Hamilton's legal team in their cross-examination of the Harrods owner. Mr Hamilton was able to win a stay on paying \u00a3500,000 of the \u00a32m in costs he owes Mr Fayed. Lord Harris of High Cross, the coordinator of Mr Hamilton's \u00a3400,000 fighting fund, also won a stay on an order that he should disclose the names of those who donated more than \u00a35,000. On March 6, lawyers for Mr Fayed failed to gain an injunction against the Daily Telegraph over the publication of extracts from a forthcoming book by Trevor Rees-Jones, The Bodyguard's Story. In the book, Mr Rees-Jones places the blame for the crash which killed Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed squarely with Mr Fayed's son, describing him as reckless, dangerous and unpredictable. He claims Dodi overruled those appointed to take care of security, changed travel plans at a moment's notice and travelled without back-up. Mr Rees-Jones portrays Mr Fayed as a fantasist who, in order to disguise his son's culpability, invented incredible conspiracy theories involving MI5 and the British establishment. He also rejects the contention that the couple were intending to marry, dismissing suggestions that Dodi had bought Princess Diana an engagement ring. Mr Fayed has claimed that the couple chose a ring in Monte Carlo before their deaths, but Mr Rees-Jones, who accompanied them on the trip wrote that they \"never went into a jewellery store\".",

After more than a year of feuding, two of the most powerful women in the Labour party have decided to bury the hatchet and forge an alliance. Margaret McDonagh, the party's general secretary, and Sally Morgan, the prime minister's political secretary, who have repeatedly clashed over Labour's \"Stop Ken\" campaign, have told friends that it is in both their interests to make up. \"Margaret and Sally have realised that their differences are not doing either of them any good,\" one friend said. \"They both realise that if one goes, the other is likely to follow soon afterwards.\" Tales of clashes between Ms McDonagh and Ms Morgan have provided an endless source of gossip for Millbank watchers during the ham-fisted campaign to block Ken Livingstone from standing as London mayor. Insults - all off the record and spun by friends - have been hurled between Downing Street and Millbank where each woman presides over a half of the prime minister's political empire. As Labour's general secretary, Ms McDonagh runs Labour's Millbank headquarters, while Ms Morgan holds sway in Downing Street as the prime minister's political secretary. Their greatest clash came as the Labour hierarchy struggled to draw up a plan to block Mr Livingstone from winning the Labour nomination for London. Ms McDonagh found herself in the firing line for opting for the controversial electoral college which handed the Labour nomination to Frank Dobson in a discredited way which appears to have made Mr Livingstone unstoppable. Ms Morgan has been criticised by Millbank for failing to focus the prime minister on the threat posed by Mr Livingstone until it was too late. The McDonagh-Morgan non-aggression pact is a demonstration of the concern at the highest levels of the Labour party that personal feuds are proving highly damaging. The feud between the Blair and Brown camps destabilised the government in the first two years after the general election, although the prime minister and chancellor maintained good relations. Ms McDonagh and Ms Morgan's friends will hope that their pact lasts.",

A collection of offbeat stories, designed with the late-night adult audience of its US cable home, Showtime, in mind, it's an anthology series in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock Presents or The Twilight Zone, shot, as Scott would have it, in a style that's \"bridging the gap between MTV and half-hour television shows.\" </p> <p>For the second series, which starts tonight, (Sci Fi Channel, 8.30pm) he's managed to convince David Bowie to take on the Alfred Hitchcock/Rod Serling presenter role, bookending the stories with his customary deadpan delivery from an abandoned prison facility in Canada. </p> <p>Speaking from his carphone in America, Scott explained why he had wanted to make the move to television after establishing himself as a director of blockbusters. </p> <p>\"Film is so hard, it's like running a marathon.

With Top Gun or Enemy Of The State I kept getting put into that box, but my favourite movie of mine is True Romance, and it's hard for me to get out of the other box and into the True Romance box, where its true strength was Tarantino's writing. But that is Hollywood. It's very hard once you get boxed to get out of it.\" </p> <p>Scott had worked with Bowie before on his first feature, the 1983 version of The Hunger, with Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon, a slick vampire flick that he describes as \"a very strange, esoteric, artsy fartsy piece\", perfect for a rainy afternoon and a joint. \"The series is really an off-shoot, in terms of content, in terms of strangeness and weirdness and otherworldliness.\" </p> <p>In the first episode, Bowie takes centre stage as a performance artist who has dropped out of the public eye. Holed up in his forbidding prison, a dystopian panopticon of surveillance cameras and grey concrete, he takes in a young man on the run, who he coerces into helping with a gruesome, visceral swansong. </p> <p>\"The way I managed to get Bowie to do this was that he loved the material. I came to it with the idea of doing a rock and roller terrified of getting old, a rip-off of Performance, a rocker who's become a recluse because of his fear of showing his age to the public, and David said: \"Hell, I've been there, I don't want to do that - let's look at the performing arts world.\" </p> <p>\"It was an interesting process with Bowie and with the writer and myself doing this original from scratch involving him and his ideas. David's pretty smart, very articulate. The other half of his life is the art world, so he was our intro into this performing arts world.

No one is prepared to explain why the cost of the building has leapt from around \u00a340m in 1997 to more than \u00a3200m. No one will say why no plans have been produced, why the opening date may be pushed back more than a year, whether the whole project may have to be scrapped.</p> <p>\"It has become Scotland's state secret,\" said an architect. \"Someone, somewhere has been keeping lots of people quiet.\"</p> <p>Even before the devolution referendum, plans for a parliament building had been taking shape. Once the vote was cast an international competition was launched to find a noteworthy architect.</p> <p>Out of 80 entrants the judges picked the renowned Catalan Enric Miralles, who promised to create a dramatic political campus, built around an \"upturned boat\" design, at the bottom of the Royal Mile. Initial estimates were between \u00a310m and \u00a340m.</p> <p>Within months the blueprint was changing and the costs rising. Members of the Scottish parliament, in their temporary home on the Mound, wanted more space. Numerous adjustments were made.</p> <p>The project manager quit and revealed this week that he had been concerned about rising costs and an unwillingness by senior civil servants to make them public.</p> <p>In June last year, Mr Dewar was talking about \u00a3109m. In the past week he has been confronted with \u00a3230m. An independent study of the project, initiated by the parliament's presiding officer, Lord Steel, is due to report by the end of the month. He has said he cannot rule out shelving the scheme.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Miralles has criticised the \"sentimental\" attitude of his clients. He said the figure of more than \u00a3200m was invention but warned that further interference would only push the price up further.</p> <p>\"I have never come across problems like this, but the team are trying not to let the controversy over costs hold us back,\" he said. \"This is a tremendously important building which must be built to last hundreds of years. At the end of the day the cost should not be the overriding concern.\"</p> <p>There are fears in parliamentary circles that he might quit.</p> <p>\"He's just so affronted that anyone is asking: Excuse me, but how much is this costing?\" said one MSP. \"He's bound to be saying to himself: What is this doing to my international reputation?\"</p> <p>Mr Dewar, beset by scandals and policy setbacks, can ill afford another crisis. There have been accusations - angrily dismissed - that he knew about the spiralling costs and wanted them glossed over.</p> <p>Some MSPs say he ought to have known.</p> <p>Ms MacDonald takes no comfort in saying she told them so. It was she who first raised concerns about the project. She noticed the lack of activity on the site. She spoke to architects and lobbied other MSPs.</p> <p>\"The role of the civil service in this has to be questioned,\" she said. An inquiry was needed into the professional, administrative and the political management of the project.</p> <p>\"The executive are worried now, and it's the strangest thing: my job has been to tell them not to panic. There is no fantastic wrong done - other than to public confidence.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "There's a big hole where Scotland's parliament should be: an empty site gouged from Edinburgh's historic heart that is swallowing ever-increasing amounts of money and casting long shadows over Donald Dewar's administration. Almost a year since devolution, the Holyrood building that was to symbolise Scotland's pride has not progressed beyond an outdated scale model. \"There are 35 cement pourers on that site, and they have not poured as much as a teaspoon of cement,\" said Margo MacDonald of the Scottish National party. \"It's the quietest construction site in the town.\" And it's an ominous silence. No one is prepared to explain why the cost of the building has leapt from around \u00a340m in 1997 to more than \u00a3200m. No one will say why no plans have been produced, why the opening date may be pushed back more than a year, whether the whole project may have to be scrapped. \"It has become Scotland's state secret,\" said an architect. \"Someone, somewhere has been keeping lots of people quiet.\" Even before the devolution referendum, plans for a parliament building had been taking shape. Once the vote was cast an international competition was launched to find a noteworthy architect. Out of 80 entrants the judges picked the renowned Catalan Enric Miralles, who promised to create a dramatic political campus, built around an \"upturned boat\" design, at the bottom of the Royal Mile. Initial estimates were between \u00a310m and \u00a340m. Within months the blueprint was changing and the costs rising. Members of the Scottish parliament, in their temporary home on the Mound, wanted more space. Numerous adjustments were made. The project manager quit and revealed this week that he had been concerned about rising costs and an unwillingness by senior civil servants to make them public. In June last year, Mr Dewar was talking about \u00a3109m. In the past week he has been confronted with \u00a3230m. An independent study of the project, initiated by the parliament's presiding officer, Lord Steel, is due to report by the end of the month. He has said he cannot rule out shelving the scheme. Meanwhile, Mr Miralles has criticised the \"sentimental\" attitude of his clients. He said the figure of more than \u00a3200m was invention but warned that further interference would only push the price up further. \"I have never come across problems like this, but the team are trying not to let the controversy over costs hold us back,\" he said. \"This is a tremendously important building which must be built to last hundreds of years. At the end of the day the cost should not be the overriding concern.\" There are fears in parliamentary circles that he might quit. \"He's just so affronted that anyone is asking: Excuse me, but how much is this costing?\" said one MSP. \"He's bound to be saying to himself: What is this doing to my international reputation?\" Mr Dewar, beset by scandals and policy setbacks, can ill afford another crisis. There have been accusations - angrily dismissed - that he knew about the spiralling costs and wanted them glossed over. Some MSPs say he ought to have known. Ms MacDonald takes no comfort in saying she told them so. It was she who first raised concerns about the project. She noticed the lack of activity on the site. She spoke to architects and lobbied other MSPs. \"The role of the civil service in this has to be questioned,\" she said. An inquiry was needed into the professional, administrative and the political management of the project. \"The executive are worried now, and it's the strangest thing: my job has been to tell them not to panic. There is no fantastic wrong done - other than to public confidence.\"",

In 1945, he married Anne Hucklebridge, and two years later left the RAFVR.</p> <p>After Oxford, Godden trained at Chichester Theological College, where he learned the habits of prayer, study and self-discipline which were to mark the rest of his life. At Chichester, he was also influenced by the 19th-century, high-church Oxford movement, and John Keble and John Henry Newman in particular.</p> <p>A year as deacon at Cuckfield, Sussex, in 1952 was followed by four years as a curate at Brighton parish church, and five years, from 1957-62, as vicar in Hangleton, a Hove housing estate. The parish hummed with activity and, at its centre, was the jovial figure of the young vicar with his wife and family, teaching the flock and training the curates. Here was someone to be reckoned with, given major responsibility early.</p> <p>Then, before he was even 40, Godden completely changed direction, moving to the country as incumbent of the three small Sussex parishes of Glynde, Firle and Bedingham. Godden became a complete country parson. Why? No one can know for sure, but it was something about the balance of prayer and activity; its roots may well have been in the inner experience of the wartime pilot.</p> <p>For 26 years, Godden remained at Glynde, tended the parishes, knew the big landowners and the small farmers intimately, kept his garden and kept his soul. In 1972, he was made archdeacon of Lewes and, three years later, of Hastings as well. He stayed on at Glynde, but now roamed over East Sussex.</p> <p>The role suited Godden's talents. He was interested in power, and didn't mind having a little of it himself. He was good at administration, and could be formidable. He was usually right in any argument. All the time, you were aware of the depths of his inner resources. And he still tended his three parishes. He was a friend and support to bishops and clergy, though he could say plain words to both. Members of the laity regarded him highly.</p> <p>After he retired, Godden filled his time with prayer, reading, gardening and caring for his friends, but not with further church activity. Few other priests had complete sets of both Keble's and Newman's sermons on their shelves, fewer still would include - as part of their spiritual exercises - the daily reading of two of these sermons.</p> <p>His beautiful and scrupulous gardening further reflected the man, and his family were cherished and loved. He remained the fascinating, magnetic, affectionate and profound being that his friends and family knew him to be. He was a quiet glory of the Church of England.</p> <p>Godden is survived by Anne and their four daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 The Venerable Max Leon Godden, priest, born November 25 1923; died March 1 2000</p>",

A year as deacon at Cuckfield, Sussex, in 1952 was followed by four years as a curate at Brighton parish church, and five years, from 1957-62, as vicar in Hangleton, a Hove housing estate. The parish hummed with activity and, at its centre, was the jovial figure of the young vicar with his wife and family, teaching the flock and training the curates. Here was someone to be reckoned with, given major responsibility early. Then, before he was even 40, Godden completely changed direction, moving to the country as incumbent of the three small Sussex parishes of Glynde, Firle and Bedingham. Godden became a complete country parson. Why? No one can know for sure, but it was something about the balance of prayer and activity; its roots may well have been in the inner experience of the wartime pilot. For 26 years, Godden remained at Glynde, tended the parishes, knew the big landowners and the small farmers intimately, kept his garden and kept his soul. In 1972, he was made archdeacon of Lewes and, three years later, of Hastings as well. He stayed on at Glynde, but now roamed over East Sussex. The role suited Godden's talents. He was interested in power, and didn't mind having a little of it himself. He was good at administration, and could be formidable. He was usually right in any argument. All the time, you were aware of the depths of his inner resources. And he still tended his three parishes. He was a friend and support to bishops and clergy, though he could say plain words to both. Members of the laity regarded him highly. After he retired, Godden filled his time with prayer, reading, gardening and caring for his friends, but not with further church activity. Few other priests had complete sets of both Keble's and Newman's sermons on their shelves, fewer still would include - as part of their spiritual exercises - the daily reading of two of these sermons. His beautiful and scrupulous gardening further reflected the man, and his family were cherished and loved. He remained the fascinating, magnetic, affectionate and profound being that his friends and family knew him to be. He was a quiet glory of the Church of England. Godden is survived by Anne and their four daughters. \u0095 The Venerable Max Leon Godden, priest, born November 25 1923; died March 1 2000",

      "bodyText": "The world's northern-most village, Longyearbyen, situated 620 miles north of the Arctic circle, is celebrating its first sunrise of the new millennium this week. Its 1,200 villagers last saw the entire sun from town in mid-October, so when it returned for about 10 minutes early on Wednesday afternoon, they were ready. Townspeople gathered to watch the first rays and sing songs to celebrate the sun's return during their traditional Sun Week festival. \"The first rays hit the steps of the old hospital,\" said a government official, Terje Carlsen. \"The hospital was torn down, but the steps were still there.\" Mr Carlsen said the sun had peaked over the steep hills flanking town earlier in the week, but it was blocked by snow. Bad weather had also threatened visibility on Wednesday - designated the village's first official sunrise of 2000 months ago. But to the delight of locals, the skies cleared just before the sun made it's brief appearance and, in keeping with local tradition, everyone watched the light hit the old hospital steps. The return of the sun \"is always a big event\", said Mr Carlsen, adding that the days were quickly getting longer. By late next month the midnight sun, with its 24-hours of daylight, will have returned to the archipelago's islands. Asked when villagers last saw the sun from town, Mr Carlsen was stumped. \"No one seems to notice when it disappears, only when it comes back.\"",

      "bodyText": "A judge is expected to deliver a crucial ruling within the next week which could determine the future of the six-year-old boy who has been the subject of an international tug-of-war since he was found clinging to an inner tube off Florida. After a hearing yesterday, Miami judge Michael Moore must decide whether he can intervene in the dispute for custody of Elian Gonzalez or whether he must allow him to be sent back to Cuba, where there are regular demonstrations for the boy's return. The case has damaged relations between the US and the Caribbean island, even though Washington believes Elian should be returned to Cuba to his father, who says he did not know that his former wife planned to make the doomed voyage to Florida. Armando Gutierrez, a spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives who have been looking after him for more than three months and want him to stay in the US, said: \"The family is praying and very hopeful.\" Most of the boy's Miami relatives believe he would have a better life if he stayed in the US and argue that his mother died trying to liberate him from Cuba when their boat capsized in November. The US government says that Elian is too young to seek political asylum and backs an immigration and naturalisation service (INS) ruling that his father is the legal guardian and that Elian should go back. Legal experts believe that Judge Moore is likely to decide that he has no jurisdiction and agree with the INS. But whichever side of the family loses is likely to appeal. Fidel Castro, the Cuban president, speaking at a protest rally, blamed US immigration policy for the impasse. He specifically targeted the Cuban adjustment act of 1966, which allows people who reach American soil from the island to stay and apply for political asylum. \"How many lives has this law cost our nation?\" he asked. \"How many lives of innocent children pulled out of school by mothers and fathers who are irresponsible or tricked by illusions?\" The US president, Bill Clinton, and the attorney general, Janet Reno, have said Elian should leave the US. Congress, which has received a bill to grant the boy US citizenship, has agreed not to act before Judge Moore's ruling. Marisleysis Gonzalez, a cousin who has been helping look after the boy in Miami, told a congressional committee that she believed his father wanted him to remain in the US, but that the Cuban government prevented him from saying so. \"He knows that he is in a country of freedom, where he is protected,\" she said. But Manuel Gonzalez, a great uncle from the other side of the family, said: \"Help return this child to his father, who needs him ... that child is going through a shock. \"He doesn't know where he is and one must act urgently and give this child the attention he needs.\" Politicians are just as divided. \"This is not just a custody issue,\" said the senate judiciary committee chairman, Orrin Hatch, a Republican, \"but a case where one of the options considered is returning this child to one of the last prison nations in the world, Fidel Castro's wretched communist dictatorship.\" But Patrick Leahy, the senior Democrat on the committee, said: \"A young boy belongs with his parent, not with distant relatives. \"Just because we oppose Fidel Castro does not mean we should oppose this boy being with his father.\"",

It was awarded, last week, to a new Cannes restaurant called Neat, named after its chef, Richard. He has just become the first British restaurateur since the second world war to win a Michelin star in France.</p> <p>Words like coals and Newcastle may spring forcefully to mind, but Neat - formerly of the ritzy two-star London eatery Pied \u00e0 Terre - insists he is not out to prove any kind of nationalist point, even if five out of the six kitchen staff in his new venture are English and it only took him six months to pick up the honour.</p> <p>\"I suppose it would have been sensible to be a little apprehensive,\" he says. \"But to be honest, I didn't even think about it. I'm surrounded by professionals, and provided you're honest, provided you serve up a quality product for a reasonable price, you'll do well. That's always been my philosophy, and it's the same here.\"</p> <p>Nor, he points out diplomatically, can the quality product he is serving up be described as English in any meaningful sense of the word. Having served under such Gallic gurus as Raymond Blanc at the Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and Joel Robuchon in Paris, and spent 14 months with \"the great unwashed\" Marco Pierre White to boot, he is definitely more cuisinier than cook.</p> <p>\"In a way, I'm a pure product of France,\" he says frankly, drawing on a post-lunch cigarette. \"I've been working in France or with French people for the past 18 years. It wouldn't be honest or sensible of me to be aggressively British about anything - and I'm hardly about to bite the hand that feeds me.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, his rapid promotion to one-star status in France, an honour for which many French chefs spend years slaving over hot vol-au-vents, has raised eyebrows. The local press has had a field day, and even national television has made the trip down to the chic Mediterranean resort town where Neat, 33, settled with his French wife Sophie in September 1998.</p> <p>Cannes was, he says, a very deliberate choice for his new venture. It was a challenge he set himself after chucking in Pied \u00e0 Terre, exhausted, in 1996, getting married and taking off on a two-year extended honeymoon to India (during which, Neat admits, he did very little except perfect his crawl in various hotel swimming pools and become a \"really rather good\" amateur chess player).</p> <p>\"This was a good place for a lot of reasons,\" he says. \"Sophie studied at Nice just along the coast, and the south of France is her adopted home.\"</p> <p>\"Cannes has a longer season than anywhere else. There are film, TV and music festivals here, conferences and congresses from January to November. And there are 150,000 Brits living within 45 minutes' drive, plus another 50,000 every summer.\"</p> <p>It took the couple and their business partner, Frenchman Bruno Asselin, some time to find the right venue, on the Place M\u00e9rim\u00e9e about 30 yards from the Congress Centre. When they first arrived, the place had just been bought by a former French textiles executive who \"rather fancied running a little bistro to keep himself from getting bored in his retirement,\" Neat says.</p> <p>That being no way to run a restaurant, the Frenchman was \"practically on his knees, begging us to buy it\" seven months later; Neat was born, and at roughly half the price its owners would have had to pay for it half a year earlier. The restaurant, redecorated by Sophie, seats 45 in winter and will take 55 when the terrace is open in summer.</p> <p>Finding the right staff was no problem, Neat says - though in the end they came from a somewhat unexpected source. The first hire was Mike, an old acquaintance from the Manoir, who was on holiday in Cannes and visiting a girlfriend at the Carlton hotel down the Croisette.</p> <p>\"He recognised the name and showed up two weeks after we opened,\" Neat says. \"He came in for a coffee and about half an hour later was asking for a job. I told him working here was different to being on holiday, but he was back in a week with his knives. It was a fait accompli.\"</p> <p>A month later came Elliot, a friend of Mike's \"who does the pastry\". Then Warren, Neat's old sous-chef at Pied \u00e0 Terre, pitched up, and finally Jimmy, who was a good friend of Warren's. It's the best way to recruit people, Neat says: everyone can vouch for everyone else.</p> <p>A battalion of Brits behind the saucepans didn't exactly go down a bundle with the local restaurateurs, however, particularly when the sought-after star came Neat's way. The reaction from the local trade was, he concedes, \"underwhelming\". But his customers - the congress business, a highly enthusiastic British community, and a small but growing band of Frenchmen - are delighted.</p> <p>\"Sophie tells me the French who come in here are a little bit sceptical at first,\" Neat says. \"But they take the plunge, they see it's a professional operation, they like what they eat - and they come back.\"</p> <p>Neat's three-course lunchtime menu is priced at 220 francs, and the dinner equivalent is 270 francs: good value by Cannes' standards and a downright steal by London's. The dishes, with the exception of his trademark escargots with morilles and garlic pur\u00e9e, are all new since the chef's Pied \u00e0 Terre days.</p> <p>There are many in Britain, and a growing number in France, who will dispute the value to a restaurant of a Michelin star. The venerable red guide, which this year celebrates its 100th anniversary, is accused of favouring the traditional over the inventive, and of placing as much emphasis on the fripperies as on the food. More than one chef in both countries has turned down a star.</p> <p>But Neat, unashamedly, is not one of the doubters. \"I've worked in gastronomic restaurants for 13 years now,\" he says. \"I like working in them because you can charge enough to buy the best produce, to get top personnel, and to attract the best clientele - people who really enjoy their food, are knowledgeable about what they're doing.</p> <p>\"It's a fact that gastronomy is judged in certain ways. Now I didn't set the goalposts, but I know what they are, and Michelin is the most creditable organisation currently giving ratings to gastronomy. I want to run a restaurant I'm proud of, and Michelin is the measure.\"</p> <p>So would he like a second star? \"One, two, three, I don't know,\" he says. \"I want to run a good restaurant, but I want a life too. Right now the most important thing is that I can do that right here - and wear shorts and sunglasses 10 months of the year.\"</p>",

I'm surrounded by professionals, and provided you're honest, provided you serve up a quality product for a reasonable price, you'll do well. That's always been my philosophy, and it's the same here.\" Nor, he points out diplomatically, can the quality product he is serving up be described as English in any meaningful sense of the word. Having served under such Gallic gurus as Raymond Blanc at the Manoir aux Quat' Saisons and Joel Robuchon in Paris, and spent 14 months with \"the great unwashed\" Marco Pierre White to boot, he is definitely more cuisinier than cook. \"In a way, I'm a pure product of France,\" he says frankly, drawing on a post-lunch cigarette. \"I've been working in France or with French people for the past 18 years. It wouldn't be honest or sensible of me to be aggressively British about anything - and I'm hardly about to bite the hand that feeds me.\" Nonetheless, his rapid promotion to one-star status in France, an honour for which many French chefs spend years slaving over hot vol-au-vents, has raised eyebrows. The local press has had a field day, and even national television has made the trip down to the chic Mediterranean resort town where Neat, 33, settled with his French wife Sophie in September 1998. Cannes was, he says, a very deliberate choice for his new venture. It was a challenge he set himself after chucking in Pied \u00e0 Terre, exhausted, in 1996, getting married and taking off on a two-year extended honeymoon to India (during which, Neat admits, he did very little except perfect his crawl in various hotel swimming pools and become a \"really rather good\" amateur chess player). \"This was a good place for a lot of reasons,\" he says. \"Sophie studied at Nice just along the coast, and the south of France is her adopted home.\" \"Cannes has a longer season than anywhere else. There are film, TV and music festivals here, conferences and congresses from January to November. And there are 150,000 Brits living within 45 minutes' drive, plus another 50,000 every summer.\" It took the couple and their business partner, Frenchman Bruno Asselin, some time to find the right venue, on the Place M\u00e9rim\u00e9e about 30 yards from the Congress Centre. When they first arrived, the place had just been bought by a former French textiles executive who \"rather fancied running a little bistro to keep himself from getting bored in his retirement,\" Neat says. That being no way to run a restaurant, the Frenchman was \"practically on his knees, begging us to buy it\" seven months later; Neat was born, and at roughly half the price its owners would have had to pay for it half a year earlier. The restaurant, redecorated by Sophie, seats 45 in winter and will take 55 when the terrace is open in summer. Finding the right staff was no problem, Neat says - though in the end they came from a somewhat unexpected source. The first hire was Mike, an old acquaintance from the Manoir, who was on holiday in Cannes and visiting a girlfriend at the Carlton hotel down the Croisette. \"He recognised the name and showed up two weeks after we opened,\" Neat says. \"He came in for a coffee and about half an hour later was asking for a job. I told him working here was different to being on holiday, but he was back in a week with his knives. It was a fait accompli.\" A month later came Elliot, a friend of Mike's \"who does the pastry\". Then Warren, Neat's old sous-chef at Pied \u00e0 Terre, pitched up, and finally Jimmy, who was a good friend of Warren's. It's the best way to recruit people, Neat says: everyone can vouch for everyone else. A battalion of Brits behind the saucepans didn't exactly go down a bundle with the local restaurateurs, however, particularly when the sought-after star came Neat's way. The reaction from the local trade was, he concedes, \"underwhelming\". But his customers - the congress business, a highly enthusiastic British community, and a small but growing band of Frenchmen - are delighted. \"Sophie tells me the French who come in here are a little bit sceptical at first,\" Neat says. \"But they take the plunge, they see it's a professional operation, they like what they eat - and they come back.\" Neat's three-course lunchtime menu is priced at 220 francs, and the dinner equivalent is 270 francs: good value by Cannes' standards and a downright steal by London's. The dishes, with the exception of his trademark escargots with morilles and garlic pur\u00e9e, are all new since the chef's Pied \u00e0 Terre days. There are many in Britain, and a growing number in France, who will dispute the value to a restaurant of a Michelin star. The venerable red guide, which this year celebrates its 100th anniversary, is accused of favouring the traditional over the inventive, and of placing as much emphasis on the fripperies as on the food. More than one chef in both countries has turned down a star. But Neat, unashamedly, is not one of the doubters. \"I've worked in gastronomic restaurants for 13 years now,\" he says. \"I like working in them because you can charge enough to buy the best produce, to get top personnel, and to attract the best clientele - people who really enjoy their food, are knowledgeable about what they're doing. \"It's a fact that gastronomy is judged in certain ways. Now I didn't set the goalposts, but I know what they are, and Michelin is the most creditable organisation currently giving ratings to gastronomy. I want to run a restaurant I'm proud of, and Michelin is the measure.\" So would he like a second star? \"One, two, three, I don't know,\" he says. \"I want to run a good restaurant, but I want a life too. Right now the most important thing is that I can do that right here - and wear shorts and sunglasses 10 months of the year.\"",

No difference? \"I think he's more guarded than he used to be.\"</p> <p>Rees-Jones says he hates this attention, hates being in the public eye. For so long, he never wanted to utter a word about the accident. He is a strong man who talks about honesty, trust, loyalty; a man who enjoyed serving the powerful and privileged - whether it be during his six years in the army (including a stint in Northern Ireland) or the Fayed family. He really did believe that discretion was the greater part of valour.</p> <p>He says he doesn't do emotional stuff, poignant stuff; he doesn't hug or cry readily, but he admits Fayed's allegations against him hurt badly. \"When they came out it was so frustrating because we had no way of replying. We felt like two normal blokes who were just out on a limb, and when this opportunity came up . . .\"</p> <p>It was important to be able to put things in his own words, not to have them \"twisted, controlled by others\".

It's been done.\"</p> <p>While Fayed was urging him to talk, others were urging him to stay silent. \"I had phonecalls when working in the sports shop saying keep your mouth shut or we'll sort you out, we know where you are. They said they were from MI6.

He also wanted to use the book to pay tribute to his mum and stepfather, who have been \"brilliant\". But the most important thing is to vindicate himself and Kez. He explains in words that seem at once clumsy and practised: \"I am confident in myself of what I did. I am confident that I did as much as I could do in that situation. I've got to look in the mirror every day and be confident with the actions I took that night. And I'm happy to do that now.\" You sense that however many times he repeats this, there will still be doubts.</p> <p>He points out that Dodi was the boss, and he had no right to stop him doing whatever he fancied. Dodi decided he and the princess would leave by the back entrance with no security. Rees-Jones intervened and insisted that they travelled with at least one security man - him.</p> <p>He talks without bitterness of the way he has been treated by Fayed. \"People are looking for a great outpouring of anger, but if we did that we'd still be living two and a half years ago.\" Has it made him more cynical? He answers questions eliptically. \"When at first I was recovering, I was trying to keep everyone happy, trying to keep all the balls in the air, and the only person I wasn't looking after was myself.\" He is alluding to the fact that when Fayed first suggested the conspiracy theory, he didn't quash it - he couldn't because he didn't have a clue what had happened. Fayed took this as Rees-Jones's tacit acceptance of an orchestrated crash.</p> <p>How is he looking after himself now? \"By doing this.\" With his version on the record, he hopes people will stop filling in the gaps, although the main gap, four minutes either side of the accident, will never be filled. He insists he never believed in a conspiracy, but he understands why so many of us are anxious to find one. \"I think the problem is that it is such an ordinary end for a person put on a pedestal. People can't believe that the Princess of Wales died in such a tragic but normal way.\"</p> <p>Why was the Fiat that is said to have scraped the Mercedes never traced? \"I try not to think about that,\" he says distantly. \"I try not to remember all the detail.\" He remembers the broader picture - the summer cruise with the Fayeds and Diana, happy times. He says it would be dishonest to pretend he had an intimate relationship with the princess, but he liked what he knew. \"What surprised me was how ordinary and natural she was. She was the sort of lady I'd be willing to take down the pub, and that's as big a compliment as I can say.\"</p> <p>And Dodi? \"I had a very professional relationship with him. He was polite, never rude, always please and thank you, and good morning and good night, and that's a pleasant atmosphere to work in.\" But the way he describes Dodi in the book makes him sound so infantile - the voracious boy who counted up his cars and played all night long. \"That's the conclusion you've drawn. I want people to draw their own conclusion.\"</p> <p>\"He's not the kind of bloke you'd want to go out for a beer with,\" says Kez. Why not? \"Because I'd probably end up paying . . . We're from different backgrounds, have different interests.\" But Diana was also from a different background. Yes, says Rees-Jones, that's why her normality was so amazing. Did he fancy her? \"Very attractive. I'm not going to say. I thought she was very attractive,\" he mumbles.</p> <p>What did she see in Dodi? \"Obviously something did click. She made the decision to go on that holiday. As far as I'm concerned, that holiday was a success, they seemed very happy.\" Then again, who wouldn't enjoy a free trip round the Mediterranean on a luxury yacht, he adds.</p> <p>When I ask whether Dodi and Diana were physical with each other, both men bristle. Kez warns that we're getting into kiss-and-tell territory, \"and as blokes we're not like that. Even if we did see that kind of crap, we wouldn't tell anybody. And we were working our balls off by the way, working 18 hours a day, and the last thing we were doing was peeping through keyholes.\"</p> <p>Rees-Jones is now working again, helping set up a security firm. Is he still haunted by the accident? He returns to the mantra. \"No, I'm confident. I'm happy with the investigation's conclusion. I'm happy with what I did that night, and I've moved on from that.\"</p> <p>However much he has put it behind him, he has to live with the fact that Dodi and Diana \"died on my shift\", as he puts it. He used to dream about the crash: he saw Fiats and motorbikes and heard Dodi's voice, and he became so confused he never knew if it was real. \"At the time, I wanted to know. I was desperate to know.\" Rees-Jones says he hates labels, but sometimes you can't avoid them. \"If you like, it's 'survivor's guilt'. I thought a while ago it would be a lot less hassle if I wasn't around, and things could have moved on.\"</p> <p>Did he get depressed? \"I had a time two Christmases ago when I thought, 'Hold on, you're not as happy as you claim to be.' You have to admit you're not Superman, you do have down periods. You have to accept it happened.\" He sits up straight and certain. \"I'm not the kind of person who would get depressed anyway.\"</p> <p>He admits that it has been odd when strangers have walked up to him, called him Trevor and shaken his hand; and he says it would have been upsetting had they not been so supportive. It must be so distressing to be a cypher for the emotion or ghoulish curiosity of others, I say. He tells me of the time he was walking through his village, head pointed down to his feet, anxious for anonymity. It dawned on him that he had started to walk like Diana.</p> <p>But now, he says, he is better, and perhaps the book is the final stage of recovery. He talks about the three who died in the car, the friends he has who are now wheelchair-bound after sports injuries, while at 31 he's playing rugby for Wrexham at a higher level than he ever has done. \"I've got nothing to complain about whatsoever. I'm very lucky.\"</p> <p>The Bodyguard's Story by Trevor Rees-Jones with Moira Johnston is published by Little Brown at \u00a316.99.</p>",

Fayed took this as Rees-Jones's tacit acceptance of an orchestrated crash. How is he looking after himself now? \"By doing this.\" With his version on the record, he hopes people will stop filling in the gaps, although the main gap, four minutes either side of the accident, will never be filled. He insists he never believed in a conspiracy, but he understands why so many of us are anxious to find one. \"I think the problem is that it is such an ordinary end for a person put on a pedestal. People can't believe that the Princess of Wales died in such a tragic but normal way.\" Why was the Fiat that is said to have scraped the Mercedes never traced? \"I try not to think about that,\" he says distantly. \"I try not to remember all the detail.\" He remembers the broader picture - the summer cruise with the Fayeds and Diana, happy times. He says it would be dishonest to pretend he had an intimate relationship with the princess, but he liked what he knew. \"What surprised me was how ordinary and natural she was. She was the sort of lady I'd be willing to take down the pub, and that's as big a compliment as I can say.\" And Dodi? \"I had a very professional relationship with him. He was polite, never rude, always please and thank you, and good morning and good night, and that's a pleasant atmosphere to work in.\" But the way he describes Dodi in the book makes him sound so infantile - the voracious boy who counted up his cars and played all night long. \"That's the conclusion you've drawn. I want people to draw their own conclusion.\" \"He's not the kind of bloke you'd want to go out for a beer with,\" says Kez. Why not? \"Because I'd probably end up paying . . . We're from different backgrounds, have different interests.\" But Diana was also from a different background. Yes, says Rees-Jones, that's why her normality was so amazing. Did he fancy her? \"Very attractive. I'm not going to say. I thought she was very attractive,\" he mumbles. What did she see in Dodi? \"Obviously something did click. She made the decision to go on that holiday. As far as I'm concerned, that holiday was a success, they seemed very happy.\" Then again, who wouldn't enjoy a free trip round the Mediterranean on a luxury yacht, he adds. When I ask whether Dodi and Diana were physical with each other, both men bristle. Kez warns that we're getting into kiss-and-tell territory, \"and as blokes we're not like that. Even if we did see that kind of crap, we wouldn't tell anybody. And we were working our balls off by the way, working 18 hours a day, and the last thing we were doing was peeping through keyholes.\" Rees-Jones is now working again, helping set up a security firm. Is he still haunted by the accident? He returns to the mantra. \"No, I'm confident. I'm happy with the investigation's conclusion. I'm happy with what I did that night, and I've moved on from that.\" However much he has put it behind him, he has to live with the fact that Dodi and Diana \"died on my shift\", as he puts it. He used to dream about the crash: he saw Fiats and motorbikes and heard Dodi's voice, and he became so confused he never knew if it was real. \"At the time, I wanted to know. I was desperate to know.\" Rees-Jones says he hates labels, but sometimes you can't avoid them. \"If you like, it's 'survivor's guilt'. I thought a while ago it would be a lot less hassle if I wasn't around, and things could have moved on.\" Did he get depressed? \"I had a time two Christmases ago when I thought, 'Hold on, you're not as happy as you claim to be.' You have to admit you're not Superman, you do have down periods. You have to accept it happened.\" He sits up straight and certain. \"I'm not the kind of person who would get depressed anyway.\" He admits that it has been odd when strangers have walked up to him, called him Trevor and shaken his hand; and he says it would have been upsetting had they not been so supportive. It must be so distressing to be a cypher for the emotion or ghoulish curiosity of others, I say. He tells me of the time he was walking through his village, head pointed down to his feet, anxious for anonymity. It dawned on him that he had started to walk like Diana. But now, he says, he is better, and perhaps the book is the final stage of recovery. He talks about the three who died in the car, the friends he has who are now wheelchair-bound after sports injuries, while at 31 he's playing rugby for Wrexham at a higher level than he ever has done. \"I've got nothing to complain about whatsoever. I'm very lucky.\" The Bodyguard's Story by Trevor Rees-Jones with Moira Johnston is published by Little Brown at \u00a316.99.",

      "trailText": "<p>Novelist John Irving tells Will Hodgkinson about the hard choices he faced in adapting his epic The Cider House Rules for the screen</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the days when John Irving thought he was going to be a professional athlete, his wrestling coach, Ted Seabrooke, told him: \"Talent is overrated. That you're not very talented needn't be the end of it.\" In the 30-odd years since he was given such backhanded reassurance, the dyslexic Irving has become one of the few American writers to consistently produce best-sellers - including The World According to Garp, The Hotel New Hampshire and A Prayer for Owen Meany - that have been hailed as literary classics. And, like many of his characters, he still wrestles. </p> <p>It is no surprise that Irving's books appeal to film-makers. Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and most recently The Cider House Rules have all been adapted for the screen. But while the richly developed characters, heartbreaking stories and sense of humanity are a gift for a director, the broad Dickensian sweep of a typical Irving novel is more daunting. How do you tie up all those convoluted plotlines, or make characters who do terrible things seem sympathetic, when you don't have the luxury of 500 pages to explain their situation? </p> <p>The Cider House Rules is typically epic. It gives equal billing to the story of Dr Larch, an ether-addicted obstetrician in 40s Maine who runs an orphanage and performs illegal abortions out of a sense of moral duty; and Homer Wells, the orphan he treats as his son who flees his work as a doctor at the orphanage to build a new life in an apple farm community. It takes in Larch's life, from a teenage encounter with a prostitute that led to a severe case of the clap and a lifetime commitment to celibacy, and that of his ward's, from four failed attempts to leave the orphanage, through his involvement with the migrant black apple-pickers whostay at the cider house, to his eventual return to the orphanage 15 years after leaving it. </p> <p>No film could contain all that. So how do you do it? Irving's solution was to adapt his novel into a screenplay himself. Plans to make the film began as early as 1986, soon after the book was published. The death of the intended director, Philip Borsos, put an end to futher developments for nine years, when Wayne Wang took up the mantle; then Michael Winterbottom, and finally Lasse Hallstrom, who completed the film with Irving's co-operation last year. The 15- year timespan of the book is compressed into 15 months, to help Irving reduce his original nine-hour draft into something more manageable. </p> <p>\"The most radical decisions about what to include in the story were made by me in the first draft, 13 or 14 years ago,\" Irving says. \"What so often goes wrong in movies made from novels is not what is left out, but characters becoming marginalised, thereby having less of an emotional effect on an audience than they should have. So early on I had the intention that the principal characters must have the same power. That you feel Mr Rose to be a sympathetic man, even though he's doing some highly unsympathetic things; that your sympathies are entirely with Dr Larch, despite the fact that he's a moral bully.\" </p> <p>It is the film's treatment of Larch and Rose - the black migrant worker the audience gets to like and respect before discovering he is having an incestuous affair with his daughter - that is the key to its success. Michael Caine's Larch could have been made a heroic pioneer who fights for a woman's right to abortion; Delroy Lindo's Rose could have been demonised, but it is through their being fully-formed people rather than symbols that the book's spirit shines through. </p> <p>\"The story isn't about the politics of abortion, it's about a period in history when abortion was illegal, and the consequences of that,\" says Irving. \"It would have been too easy to make Mr Rose unsympathetic, and it's an argument that the pro- lifers use if you ask them if abortions should be allowed to victims of rape. You know, 'Well obviously, that's all right'. So to demonise Rose, and to simplify the situation like that, would have been wrong. Mr Rose is a likeable man doing a highly unpleasant thing.\" In the book, Rose also keeps his daughter in line by cutting her constantly and by not teaching her to read, even though he can. \"We cut those from the film,\" says Irving. \"When you get an actor of Delroy's class you want to help him a bit. It would have been too much to ask of him to make people like this man if we included that too.\" </p> <p>Larch has also been toned down. The manic, controlling doctor of the book has been replaced by Michael Caine's gentler, more normal patriarch, who flirts with the nurses and screens King Kong for the orphans with a tired resignation rather than a furious raging against the world beyond his own. \"Again, there wasn't time in the film to explain Larch as he is in the book,\" says Irving. \"If you asked the audience to accept this man who goes around shouting at everyone, is sexually abstemious, and is addicted to ether, then you've got a character who can be written off as a comic eccentric. And he had to be likeable: if we made a picture of this old guy yelling at this hesitant kid everybody would hate him.\" </p> <p>Tobey Maguire's Homer Wells is the real star of the film. Maguire, familiar from The Ice Storm and Pleasantville, portrays the orphan as a gentle innocent with a look of detached bemusement. \"The choices we made on what to include from the book made Tobey the star of the film,\" says Irving. \"Homer is passive, he doesn't talk much, so his facial characteristics have to say everything. The most important moment for Homer is when he stands up to Mr Rose who, he discovers, has got his own daughter pregnant. He makes the most of the visual language film relies on, with expressions that tell everything you need to know about him. It's the point in the story where he becomes a man, and Tobey said everything with the right expression.\" </p> <p>The pruning of the book that made a working film out of it saw the loss of Homer Wells's nemesis, the incredible Melony. A fellow orphan, Melony is a furious, heavy-boned tough who seduces the adolescent Homer by showing him a photograph of a woman with a horse's penis in her mouth; tears down a derelict building with her bare hands; and embarks on a search for Homer after he leaves the orphanage that sets a pace for the rest of the book. \"She went in the first draft of the screenplay. She's just too overbearing for this quiet little kid,\" says Irving. \"Homer's decisions are being formed by these two dominant men; to throw her into the equation might have wiped him out completely. But I went to a stage adaptation of The Cider House Rules that kept Melony in, and it was like seeing an old friend once more. She's a character that nobody forgets.\" </p> <p>The Cider House Rules is the most successful film of Irving's books; the director of My Life as a Dog is, after all, the perfect choice for a tale about the flowering of a young man out of step with the world around him. George Roy Hill's film version of The World According to Garp kept that book's epic scale but substituted quirky humour for one-liners; Tony Richardson's The Hotel New Hampshire was overtly camp. Hallstrom's film moves the audience in the same way as the book moves the reader, despite the changes in plot and timing. </p> <p>After such a happy creative partnership, and with another novel, A Son of the Circus, already in production with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange signed up, it would be understandable for Irving to be tempted away from the solitude of novel-writing, but he remains true to his craft. \"I like my day job better. I like it that for three or four years the only person who knows what I'm doing is my wife. But what we had on Cider House is unusual. Lasse, Richard Gladstein [the producer] and I had total creative control, and we had a rule that if two of us agreed on something, then the third would have to yield. But it never happened. That must be rare for a film.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Cider House Rules is released next Friday. It has received seven Oscar nominations.</p>",

That you're not very talented needn't be the end of it.\" In the 30-odd years since he was given such backhanded reassurance, the dyslexic Irving has become one of the few American writers to consistently produce best-sellers - including The World According to Garp, The Hotel New Hampshire and A Prayer for Owen Meany - that have been hailed as literary classics. And, like many of his characters, he still wrestles. It is no surprise that Irving's books appeal to film-makers. Garp, Hotel New Hampshire and most recently The Cider House Rules have all been adapted for the screen. But while the richly developed characters, heartbreaking stories and sense of humanity are a gift for a director, the broad Dickensian sweep of a typical Irving novel is more daunting. How do you tie up all those convoluted plotlines, or make characters who do terrible things seem sympathetic, when you don't have the luxury of 500 pages to explain their situation? The Cider House Rules is typically epic. It gives equal billing to the story of Dr Larch, an ether-addicted obstetrician in 40s Maine who runs an orphanage and performs illegal abortions out of a sense of moral duty; and Homer Wells, the orphan he treats as his son who flees his work as a doctor at the orphanage to build a new life in an apple farm community. It takes in Larch's life, from a teenage encounter with a prostitute that led to a severe case of the clap and a lifetime commitment to celibacy, and that of his ward's, from four failed attempts to leave the orphanage, through his involvement with the migrant black apple-pickers whostay at the cider house, to his eventual return to the orphanage 15 years after leaving it. No film could contain all that. So how do you do it? Irving's solution was to adapt his novel into a screenplay himself. Plans to make the film began as early as 1986, soon after the book was published. The death of the intended director, Philip Borsos, put an end to futher developments for nine years, when Wayne Wang took up the mantle; then Michael Winterbottom, and finally Lasse Hallstrom, who completed the film with Irving's co-operation last year. The 15- year timespan of the book is compressed into 15 months, to help Irving reduce his original nine-hour draft into something more manageable. \"The most radical decisions about what to include in the story were made by me in the first draft, 13 or 14 years ago,\" Irving says. \"What so often goes wrong in movies made from novels is not what is left out, but characters becoming marginalised, thereby having less of an emotional effect on an audience than they should have. So early on I had the intention that the principal characters must have the same power. That you feel Mr Rose to be a sympathetic man, even though he's doing some highly unsympathetic things; that your sympathies are entirely with Dr Larch, despite the fact that he's a moral bully.\" It is the film's treatment of Larch and Rose - the black migrant worker the audience gets to like and respect before discovering he is having an incestuous affair with his daughter - that is the key to its success. Michael Caine's Larch could have been made a heroic pioneer who fights for a woman's right to abortion; Delroy Lindo's Rose could have been demonised, but it is through their being fully-formed people rather than symbols that the book's spirit shines through. \"The story isn't about the politics of abortion, it's about a period in history when abortion was illegal, and the consequences of that,\" says Irving. \"It would have been too easy to make Mr Rose unsympathetic, and it's an argument that the pro- lifers use if you ask them if abortions should be allowed to victims of rape. You know, 'Well obviously, that's all right'. So to demonise Rose, and to simplify the situation like that, would have been wrong. Mr Rose is a likeable man doing a highly unpleasant thing.\" In the book, Rose also keeps his daughter in line by cutting her constantly and by not teaching her to read, even though he can. \"We cut those from the film,\" says Irving. \"When you get an actor of Delroy's class you want to help him a bit. It would have been too much to ask of him to make people like this man if we included that too.\" Larch has also been toned down. The manic, controlling doctor of the book has been replaced by Michael Caine's gentler, more normal patriarch, who flirts with the nurses and screens King Kong for the orphans with a tired resignation rather than a furious raging against the world beyond his own. \"Again, there wasn't time in the film to explain Larch as he is in the book,\" says Irving. \"If you asked the audience to accept this man who goes around shouting at everyone, is sexually abstemious, and is addicted to ether, then you've got a character who can be written off as a comic eccentric. And he had to be likeable: if we made a picture of this old guy yelling at this hesitant kid everybody would hate him.\" Tobey Maguire's Homer Wells is the real star of the film. Maguire, familiar from The Ice Storm and Pleasantville, portrays the orphan as a gentle innocent with a look of detached bemusement. \"The choices we made on what to include from the book made Tobey the star of the film,\" says Irving. \"Homer is passive, he doesn't talk much, so his facial characteristics have to say everything. The most important moment for Homer is when he stands up to Mr Rose who, he discovers, has got his own daughter pregnant. He makes the most of the visual language film relies on, with expressions that tell everything you need to know about him. It's the point in the story where he becomes a man, and Tobey said everything with the right expression.\" The pruning of the book that made a working film out of it saw the loss of Homer Wells's nemesis, the incredible Melony. A fellow orphan, Melony is a furious, heavy-boned tough who seduces the adolescent Homer by showing him a photograph of a woman with a horse's penis in her mouth; tears down a derelict building with her bare hands; and embarks on a search for Homer after he leaves the orphanage that sets a pace for the rest of the book. \"She went in the first draft of the screenplay. She's just too overbearing for this quiet little kid,\" says Irving. \"Homer's decisions are being formed by these two dominant men; to throw her into the equation might have wiped him out completely. But I went to a stage adaptation of The Cider House Rules that kept Melony in, and it was like seeing an old friend once more. She's a character that nobody forgets.\" The Cider House Rules is the most successful film of Irving's books; the director of My Life as a Dog is, after all, the perfect choice for a tale about the flowering of a young man out of step with the world around him. George Roy Hill's film version of The World According to Garp kept that book's epic scale but substituted quirky humour for one-liners; Tony Richardson's The Hotel New Hampshire was overtly camp. Hallstrom's film moves the audience in the same way as the book moves the reader, despite the changes in plot and timing. After such a happy creative partnership, and with another novel, A Son of the Circus, already in production with Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange signed up, it would be understandable for Irving to be tempted away from the solitude of novel-writing, but he remains true to his craft. \"I like my day job better. I like it that for three or four years the only person who knows what I'm doing is my wife. But what we had on Cider House is unusual. Lasse, Richard Gladstein [the producer] and I had total creative control, and we had a rule that if two of us agreed on something, then the third would have to yield. But it never happened. That must be rare for a film.\" \u0095 The Cider House Rules is released next Friday. It has received seven Oscar nominations.",

      "body": "<p>When all the simmering conflicts finally come to a boil in Paul Thomas Anderson's 70s porn-industry epic Boogie Nights, protagonist Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), porn star and possessor of a much-coveted 13-inch penis, issues a perfectly inarticulate, impassioned, if ultimately useless declaration of independence. Dirk's erectile capacity has been badly eroded by his coke intake and he knows at best he only has a 20-minute window of tumescence to exploit before his talent turns once again to, well, to ashes in his hand. But director and father-figure Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) isn't ready, and there's a big fight that turns nasty. </p> <p>Before long they're being pulled off each other by the crew members as Dirk screams, \"You're not the boss of me, Jack! You're not the king of Dirk! I'm the boss of me! I'm the king of me. I'm Dirk Diggler! I'm the star! It's my big dick and I say when we roll!\" Anderson is 30 years old. He's made three movies, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and now Magnolia, each of which has been called a masterpiece. He is routinely heralded as one of the great hopes of the American cinema, someone who got started early and who may have a lifetime of great movies inside him. </p> <p>The producers of his first movie, Hard Eight - which he still calls by its original title, Sidney - tried to be the boss of Paul, the king of Paul, but he fought to have his own version released and against all the odds, he won. \"It fucked up my entry into this whole world,\" he says. \"Or maybe it actually helped, because it sure as hell put me on my guard.\" On Boogie Nights, Anderson was able to release the movie he'd envisaged, having developed the armour to keep the money men off his back. And with Magnolia, he got what every director twice his age still dreams of the moment his head hits the pillow: Final Cut. </p> <p>Even Martin Scorsese had to wait more than 25 years for the right not to have his films molested by the suits. \"It's pretty unusual,\" says Anderson, \"but the concept is that once you've got it, you've got it for life. It feels great!\" Now no one's the boss of Paul Thomas Anderson. Paul's the king of Paul. It's his big dick, and he says when we roll. There are those who'll say that Magnolia, at 188 minutes and featuring some 20 characters, is a repudiation of the very notion of final cut, that no movie deserves to carve that much time out of a viewer's life, that surely the backers could have imposed some discipline and order on the project had it not been for the director's special privilege. </p> <p>This might be more plausible if Magnolia weren't as compelling and cussedly ambitious as it is, but it isn't the kind of film that can be shoehorned into any safe categories, and that alone will always make the unimaginative critic reach elbow-deep into his arsenal of uncomprehending put-downs. Magnolia is hip enough, I suppose, but it's also unabashedly, transcendently emotional, which is about as unhip as you'll ever get in Los Angeles. It's a semi- independent movie in financial terms (mini-major Fine Line is the backer) but it's about parents and children, life's bystanders, and about love and security lost and found. </p> <p>There are none of the tired tropes and tics one associates with post-Tarantino indie film-making - no five-way Mexican stand-offs, no arch quoting of naff movies, no brand-name humour, and no genre-twisting. The result is a giant mosaic that makes up one day in the life of the characters, constructed tile by tiny tile until a huge collective portrait emerges, with characters linked by what the film's narrator call \"things that are not, one hopes, merely a matter of chance\". </p> <p>Anderson never intended that it become so big. \"It came from a much smaller plane,\" he explains. \"I wanted to make something that was intimate and small- scale, and I thought that I would do it very, very quickly. The point was that I wanted to shed myself of everything that was happening around Boogie Nights. And I started to write and well, it kept blossoming. And I got to the point where still it's a very intimate movie, but I realised I had so many actors I wanted to write for that the form started to come more from them. Then I thought it would be really interesting to put this epic spin on topics that don't necessarily get the epic treatment, which is usually reserved for war movies or political topics. But the things that I know as big and emotional are these real intimate everyday moments, like losing your car keys, for example. You could start with something like that and go anywhere.\" </p> <p>As a writer, Anderson starts with lists, actors and music. \"Magnolia came out of Aimee Mann's songs, which I was listening to at the time I was starting to write. I had her two solo albums and a lot of her demos, because she's a friend, and I think the tone she gets is really beautiful. So I thought about using them as a basis, or as inspiration for the film.\" </p> <p>Indeed, certain lines of dialogue in Magnolia come directly from Mann's songs, including \"Now that you've met me, would you object if you never saw me again?\" which is the crux of one thread of the narrative. And towards the finale, Anderson lays Mann's Wise Up on the soundtrack and cuts all across the San Fernando Valley to his different characters, who all dreamily sing along with a line each from the song. It should be a ridiculous moment, but it's the emotional high point of the movie, capable of reducing entire rows of filmgoers to tears. </p> <p>\"I wondered about that moment too,\" says Anderson, \"but I tricked everyone by getting Julianne Moore to do it first. She can always set the pace, because actors are so competitive. Then everyone was up for it.\" Anderson's scripts, he says, start out as \"lists of things that are interesting to me, images, words, ideas, and slowly they start resolving themselves into sequences and shots and dialogue.\" </p> <p> For Magnolia, he first saw an image of the smiling face of his friend, actress Melora Walters, and went from there. Having consolidated an Altmanesque de facto repertory company in the course of making Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, Anderson is now free to write with specific actors in mind, actors who he stresses are his friends off-set, not just his employees. \"John Reilly came up with most of his character a couple of summers ago, after he grew a moustache for fun. He started to work up this not very smart cop character and we did a sort of take off on Cops [a Fox reality show in which camera crews go on police call-outs] with me chasing him around the streets with a video camera. We did several - Jennifer Jason Leigh was in one - and some of the Reilly character's line come from that far back. </p> <p>\"That's a case of an actor really bringing something in, because John basically co-created the character. But I always try to sneak a little bit of them in there, their little traits that I know. I also wanted to make John a romantic lead, because I've always seen him that way.\" The other actors all received similar care in the development of their roles. \"I really didn't want Phillip Seymour Hoffman to play another character-character, you know what I mean? I wanted him to play a really simple, uncomplicated, caring character. </p> <p>\"And Julianne Moore, I just thought I really wanted to see her explode. I just haven't seen her do that. I said, 'I want you to go fucking nuts!' Crazy is so hard to play, there's nothing you can really tell an actor. You end up saying, 'She's nuts, and she's on so many pharmaceuticals, and I can't rationalise her behaviour. Just go nuts'.\" As for William H Macy, \"I think he's scared of big emotional parts - he thinks actors shouldn't cry - so I wrote a big tearful, emotional part just for him.\" </p> <p>Anyone who knows Anderson's movies knows that they celebrate the San Fernando Valley, the city \"over the hill\" that Angelenos feel duty bound to hate in the way other Americans feel duty bound to loathe Los Angeles itself. </p> <p>\"Boogie Nights and Magnolia are both fuck-you celebrations of the Valley,\" says Anderson. \"I don't hate it simply because I grew up there, in Studio City. I'm just always nostalgic for it. It makes me comfortable. I wrote this article for the New York Times about it and I said as a kid I was really self-conscious, because I wanted to be a director but I was 'from the Valley...' It wasn't like I was in a war with John Ford, or I grew up on the streets of New York. I'm from the Valley. What do I have to offer? And once you get past that insecurity, you're all set. So many people from Hollywood, the other side of the hill, they just rag it so hard. Whatever, fuck it, I love it.\" </p> <p>Anderson's late father Ernie, to whom Boogie Nights was dedicated, was for years \"The Voice of ABC\" and made a living doing voiceovers for the ABC network. In a previous life, back in Cleveland, Ohio, Ernie had worked as a local TV announcer who gained fame as the Ghost-Host Ghoulardi. He introduced broadcasts of horror movies in a costume and mask, interrupted the screenings, talked over the dialogue and generally delighted his juvenile audience with every manner of inspired idiocy. </p> <p>They still mention him from time to time on The Drew Carey Show - and always in tones of reverence. \"He was very wonderful, totally unique,\" says Anderson, whose films are filled with fathers both real and surrogate. Anderson scorned film school, though he attended NYU for two days. \"I had a feeling that I didn't want to go there anyway. The first day I took some pages from a David Mamet script and handed them in as my own - and it got a C-plus. I thought they should go fuck themselves because Mamet - you know, Pulitzer prizewinner, great playwright - he deserved a little better than a C-plus. </p> <p>\"I met all these people who said 'I'm gonna go learn about movies at film school.' And I would say, 'You're what? Watch your fucking TV! That's what it's for!\"' Anderson once said you could learn more from the director's commentary on the laser-disc version of Bad Day at Black Rock than from 10 years in film school. </p> <p>After that he worked odd-jobs ('messenger, bird shop assistant') before securing a place in the Sundance director's workshop. \"I'm not really a Sundance baby, but they helped me so much I feel I have to acknowledge it,\" he says, perhaps reluctant to associated himself too closely with Planet Redford. Then came Sidney, a noirish character study with Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow and Philip Baker Hall (\"one of the best American actors alive\" and an Anderson regular) set in Reno. Anderson is very happy that the backer, Rysher Entertainment, is now defunct. \"They were altering the performances. They were butchering it. Rescoring it, reformatting it. I shot the film widescreen and they reformatted it 1:1.85. I mean that's fucking insane - its a very conscientiously framed movie - and every shot changed. Literally every composition.\" </p> <p>Luckily he had his own cut and it was this version that won awards at several festivals. \"It made me very gun-shy, anxious to be in total control.\" With Boogie Nights he was in the gentler care of Fine Line, but still had to deal with the MPAA ratings board. \"They're not bad people and a lot of the things make perfect sense, but a lot of them don't. We'd say, 'I understand that blood and sex is not good in the same scene or the same shot, but can you explain about humping and talking at the same time?' I don't get that - what should I do?\" </p> <p>You meet the megaplex movie fan in Anderson when you ask him who he'd like to work with in future and whose work he's looking forward to. Where previously he has sung the praises of Max Ophuls as the world's greatest proponent of the moving camera, and namechecked Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray, now he's talking about how much he wants to see the new Jonathan Demme movie (\"Whatever it is, I don't care\"), and the next Tarantino film. \"I'm really looking forward to Mission: Impossible 2. I'm a John Woo fan, sure, but I'm really a Tom Cruise fan. I asked Cruise about it after I saw the trailer (an absurdly kinetic 45 seconds of Woo magic) and he said, 'It's all like the trailer!' I can't wait.\" </p> <p>The real surprise came when I asked him who he'd like to work with. \"Somebody I'd really like to use is Adam Sandler. I just cry with laughter in his movies.\" As far as I can determine he's not being facetious. He also admires Daniel Day-Lewis. \"He's just a powerhouse. All of his films are really solid.\" And of his own future? \"Images, thoughts, ideas, preliminary stuff. But I'm determined it'll be 90 minutes. I'm gonna show the whole world...\"</p>",

After that he worked odd-jobs ('messenger, bird shop assistant') before securing a place in the Sundance director's workshop. \"I'm not really a Sundance baby, but they helped me so much I feel I have to acknowledge it,\" he says, perhaps reluctant to associated himself too closely with Planet Redford. Then came Sidney, a noirish character study with Reilly, Gwyneth Paltrow and Philip Baker Hall (\"one of the best American actors alive\" and an Anderson regular) set in Reno. Anderson is very happy that the backer, Rysher Entertainment, is now defunct. \"They were altering the performances. They were butchering it. Rescoring it, reformatting it. I shot the film widescreen and they reformatted it 1:1.85. I mean that's fucking insane - its a very conscientiously framed movie - and every shot changed. Literally every composition.\" Luckily he had his own cut and it was this version that won awards at several festivals. \"It made me very gun-shy, anxious to be in total control.\" With Boogie Nights he was in the gentler care of Fine Line, but still had to deal with the MPAA ratings board. \"They're not bad people and a lot of the things make perfect sense, but a lot of them don't. We'd say, 'I understand that blood and sex is not good in the same scene or the same shot, but can you explain about humping and talking at the same time?' I don't get that - what should I do?\" You meet the megaplex movie fan in Anderson when you ask him who he'd like to work with in future and whose work he's looking forward to. Where previously he has sung the praises of Max Ophuls as the world's greatest proponent of the moving camera, and namechecked Douglas Sirk and Nicholas Ray, now he's talking about how much he wants to see the new Jonathan Demme movie (\"Whatever it is, I don't care\"), and the next Tarantino film. \"I'm really looking forward to Mission: Impossible 2. I'm a John Woo fan, sure, but I'm really a Tom Cruise fan. I asked Cruise about it after I saw the trailer (an absurdly kinetic 45 seconds of Woo magic) and he said, 'It's all like the trailer!' I can't wait.\" The real surprise came when I asked him who he'd like to work with. \"Somebody I'd really like to use is Adam Sandler. I just cry with laughter in his movies.\" As far as I can determine he's not being facetious. He also admires Daniel Day-Lewis. \"He's just a powerhouse. All of his films are really solid.\" And of his own future? \"Images, thoughts, ideas, preliminary stuff. But I'm determined it'll be 90 minutes. I'm gonna show the whole world...\"",

      "body": "<p>England winning the World Cup wasn't all that happened in 1966. It was also the year of Alfie. When the chips were down at Wembley, English fans would chant What's it all about, Alfie? to manager Ramsay. Yet two years before, Alfie's director, Lewis Gilbert, had despaired as a revolution in Sudan sank the big picture he hoped would make his name. With Burt Lancaster and Lawrence Olivier, Gilbert was ready to shoot in Khartoum. \"Paramount asked if I had anything else\", he recalls. \"I offered a small play I'd optioned.\" It was Alfie. </p> <p>In real terms it's one of the most profitable movies ever, but Alfie remains a milestone because it blew a hole in Hollywood censorship and took cinema in a new direction. It also made Michael Caine a world star and propelled Gilbert to the directors' A-list. </p> <p>The Hollywood studios continue to offer big movies to Gilbert, who was 80 on Monday. Amazingly, he's been directing continuously since the 40s. He starts a seventh decade in the job with his current project falling into place - Shelagh Stephenson's The Memory of Water. It will be his 38th feature. We've all grown up with some of the other 37 - but unconsciously: somehow, we've missed the man behind them. That's odd, for his life is a history of British cinema. Gilbert thinks he first acted in a silent film as far back as 1925. He was born into a London family whose trade had long been vaudeville. Mum and dad played the halls with Chaplin. \"I was brought up in a theatre. Aged four, I used to stand on the edge of a stage and see people laugh. I loved to watch that\". Yet his father died young. Gilbert acted in childhood to support a poor family. It created a compulsive need to work that's never left him. </p> <p>From the start he imbibed a useful truth: theatre and film should be enjoyable. He certainly found it fun. \"They were always nice to children in film\". Yet adults couldn't hide its insecurity. \"The silent died almost overnight. 4-5,000 were thrown out of work\". They were mostly musicians in cinema orchestras, the people who provided DW Griffith's \"voice of the silent drama\". Soon, they played the streets with a card saying \"ex-cinema violinist\". </p> <p>In his teens, Gilbert graduated to supporting roles via quota quickies (when an act required a proportion of British films to be shown, however cheaply made) and Will Hay films. Life took a new turn when acting with Olivier in The Divorce Of Lady X, a Technicolor production of Korda's. Olivier was friendly, \"though he had such majesty, he couldn't play an ordinary man\". Korda offered to send the 17-year-old Gilbert to Rada. He boldly said he wanted to direct. Korda laughed and fixed him up as a lowly assistant at Denham. </p> <p>The cinema education he'd absorbed since infancy paid off. \"I became a first assistant at 19 because I'd already been around so long. I always had confidence\". Earlier, he'd been third assistant to Hitchcock himself , on Jamaica Inn. \"He was the man I learned the most from. He knew best how to handle actors. He'd destroy arrogant ones\". Gilbert peppered him with questions. Hitchcock clearly liked him enough to make him the butt of his deadpan humour. \"After one take, he said 'print that' and turned to me. 'Was it all right for you, Mr Gilbert?'\" </p> <p>War took Gilbert into the RAF - and later, the US Air Corps film unit, where he assisted Warners veteran William Keighley on documentaries. The great man preferred his Mayfair hotel to our weather, so he gave Gilbert his directing break. </p> <p>After the war, at Gaumont-British Instructional, Gilbert moved from his own documentaries to directing The Little Ballerina, his debut feature, a 1946 children's picture featuring Margot Fonteyn. </p> <p>If ever British film had a golden age, it was then. Was it the bliss it must seem to any director trying to start today? The answer's yes. \"In the 40s you could make a supporting movie for \u00a312,000. With no TV, people just sat through them. It didn't matter if you failed. It was a good chance to progress\". Gilbert ascended the budget stairway to the stars. \"Gradually you went from \u00a312,000 to \u00a320,000 to \u00a325,000 a picture, and as director, you actually made the film.\" </p> <p>At \u00a320,000 he struck gold, with Emergency Call, in 1951. Jack Warner's race against time to find the three people with the right blood type to save a child established Gilbert as a British director. However, the turbulence he hit the following year with Cosh Boy is more intriguing. This pioneer X-film featuring a young Joan Collins was widely banned. Release coincided with Derek Bentley's trial. A rancid press linked the film to his 'crime'. \"Today, you'd show it to 10-year-olds,\" he says. </p> <p>Gilbert found his metier in that typically 50s' genre, the war movie. \"I did the films I know about. So, after the RAF, I did war films\". The best-known examples - Reach for the Sky in 1955, Carve Her Name With Pride in 1958 and Sink the Bismarck! (1960) are classics we've been watching for years. Whenever TV does a documentary on wartime secret agents, you expect to see a clip from Carve Her Name. Like Reach for the Sky, it was the most successful British film of its year, earning big money for Rank - where most of the studio's films lost it. </p> <p>Reach for the Sky won the Bafta for best British film, and started Gilbert's fruitful association with Kenneth More. (They made four films together, including Bismarck). Rank supremo John Davis was keen to nurture Gilbert. He found Davis straight - and rude, \"I went to discuss Carve Her Name with him. Earl St John, head of production at Pinewood, came along. 'Don't just stand there', Davis bawled. 'Get Mr Gilbert a chair.' \" </p> <p>Davis wanted Rank to take on the world. He set up his own US distribution arm, starting with Reach for the Sky. It never stood a chance. A similar illusion led him to try making his own international epics, Ferry to Hong Kong being the chosen vehicle. Curt Jurgens and Orson Welles led the cast and Gilbert was signed to direct. </p> <p>Making Ferry was an ordeal. Gilbert found Welles \"a genius - but just impossible. Orson, having been a director, knew his way round. You couldn't argue with him or he'd go sick. Just for a day, because he knew the insurers wouldn't then pay out. Then he'd go slow.\" To make things worse, Jurgens and Welles hated each other. </p> <p>By now, Gilbert was feeling a rival pull from Hollywood. Back in 1956 he'd first worked for Americans, directing The Admirable Crichton for Columbia. Harry Cohn, the studio's ruler, loved the film and summoned Gilbert over. At New York airport, he received a dignitary's welcome - without a dollar in his pocket, thanks to exchange controls. After days of waiting, Gilbert finally met the man who said 'I don't have ulcers. I give them'. \"He really did have six yes-men standing round him. He said 'I'm going to take you to Holly wood'. \" But Gilbert pleaded a prior booking back home and they never went. </p> <p>Sink the Bismarck! was the kind of British US hit Davis craved because we didn't fund it. Backing by 20th Century Fox guaranteed it a flightpath to US cinemas. Gilbert quickly grasped a harsh truth: British storylines can play the world - but only if pushed by US distribution muscle. From now on almost all his films, however British they looked, would be American-financed. Even Alfie. </p> <p>Terence Stamp offered to play Alfie for nothing. Gilbert's son John suggested Michael Caine. \"Today, women find Alfie a neanderthal,\" says Gilbert. His creator, Bill Naughton, certainly didn't like him. \"You're meant to disapprove of him but the film was a success because he was the first anti-hero.\" Naughton included the abortion scene so that people would question the practice. \"Before then, you couldn't mention abortion in US cinema,\" Gilbert recalls. \"The censor rang me for advice and passed the scene. Alfie changed America's censorship laws\". </p> <p>Its success brought Gilbert the best directing job on offer - You Only Live Twice. It's one of three Bonds he's made, along with The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. The second is his favourite, but Twice remains a magnificent film in terms of pace, structure and visuals. There was a compelling reason for making it: \"We knew we'd at least have an audience\". </p> <p>While it was being made, Paramount was buying Gilbert's company in order to acquire Alfie. Gilbert had agreed to make Oliver! for his friend John Woolf. Paramount's new owner, Gulf and Western, at first agreed but then decided Gilbert could only direct for Paramount. \"It was the lowest point in my life. I'd developed Oliver! with Lionel Bart. I had to do The Adventurers instead\". Gilbert suggested Carol Reed might like Oliver! The Adventurers, a Harold Robbins tale was not a success. </p> <p>Things stayed out of kilter with Paramount. \"While doing this film, I signed to do The Godfather. Because of their financial problems, Paramount could only find $2m to make it. I said it needed $7m\". Instead, Gilbert made them a low-budget film called Friends. It did well, winning best foreign film at the Golden Globes. \"Paramount meanwhile had an unexpected hit in Love Story so they were back in the money. They could then spend properly on The Godfather. Coppola made it and the rest is history.\" </p> <p>Bond kept Gilbert busy for much of the 70s but in the following decade he aimed for more intimate fare. His wife Hylda - they've been married for 55 years - had once spotted Alfie. Now she suggested Willy Russell's play, Educating Rita. You'd think it easy to raise money if your last film was Moonraker. \"Yet everyone turned down Rita. Columbia wanted me to cast Dolly Parton as Rita\". When Gilbert had finished the film, he had US distributors fighting over it and was able to cut a deal that avoided the usual fatal subtraction. </p> <p>Rita won Gilbert another Bafta for best film, a distinction he shares with Richard Attenborough and John Schlesinger among his living British contemporaries. It also led him to another Russell play, Shirley Valentine. After its success, Bafta handed Gilbert the Michael Balcon award for his life's work. It's reputedly the Queen's favourite film. </p> <p>Certainly, Rex Reed - doyen of US critics - declared that Shirley Valentine proved Gilbert was \"the best woman's director since Cukor\". It's a phrase we no longer hear. Gilbert says it was once the highest praise. \"Women used to be the dominant force in cinema. Then, they chose the film and you made it for them. Nowadays films are mostly about two men\". He feels this masculinising of movies, caused by special effects, is the biggest change to the medium he's seen in his lifetime. So is he returning to \"women's pictures\" by taking Stephenson's adaptation of her play, The Memory of Water, which shoots this year? \"Not exactly. Although it's largely about three women, it's actually a comedy\". (The play won best new comedy at last month's Olivier Awards). </p> <p>Gilbert's output earned him a CBE in 1997 and the industry has honoured him handsomely, though he's never been fashionable. \"Maybe that's why I've endured. Fashion is something that doesn't last\". </p> <p>There's a nice twist to the tale though. Back in 1932, Gilbert played a lead in Dick Turpin with Victor McLaglen. Interviewed by the Star, a long-vanished London evening paper, he was asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. \"I want to be in films until I'm 80,\" he said. Not many of us fulfil our childhood dream.</p>",

Orson, having been a director, knew his way round. You couldn't argue with him or he'd go sick. Just for a day, because he knew the insurers wouldn't then pay out. Then he'd go slow.\" To make things worse, Jurgens and Welles hated each other. By now, Gilbert was feeling a rival pull from Hollywood. Back in 1956 he'd first worked for Americans, directing The Admirable Crichton for Columbia. Harry Cohn, the studio's ruler, loved the film and summoned Gilbert over. At New York airport, he received a dignitary's welcome - without a dollar in his pocket, thanks to exchange controls. After days of waiting, Gilbert finally met the man who said 'I don't have ulcers. I give them'. \"He really did have six yes-men standing round him. He said 'I'm going to take you to Holly wood'. \" But Gilbert pleaded a prior booking back home and they never went. Sink the Bismarck! was the kind of British US hit Davis craved because we didn't fund it. Backing by 20th Century Fox guaranteed it a flightpath to US cinemas. Gilbert quickly grasped a harsh truth: British storylines can play the world - but only if pushed by US distribution muscle. From now on almost all his films, however British they looked, would be American-financed. Even Alfie. Terence Stamp offered to play Alfie for nothing. Gilbert's son John suggested Michael Caine. \"Today, women find Alfie a neanderthal,\" says Gilbert. His creator, Bill Naughton, certainly didn't like him. \"You're meant to disapprove of him but the film was a success because he was the first anti-hero.\" Naughton included the abortion scene so that people would question the practice. \"Before then, you couldn't mention abortion in US cinema,\" Gilbert recalls. \"The censor rang me for advice and passed the scene. Alfie changed America's censorship laws\". Its success brought Gilbert the best directing job on offer - You Only Live Twice. It's one of three Bonds he's made, along with The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker. The second is his favourite, but Twice remains a magnificent film in terms of pace, structure and visuals. There was a compelling reason for making it: \"We knew we'd at least have an audience\". While it was being made, Paramount was buying Gilbert's company in order to acquire Alfie. Gilbert had agreed to make Oliver! for his friend John Woolf. Paramount's new owner, Gulf and Western, at first agreed but then decided Gilbert could only direct for Paramount. \"It was the lowest point in my life. I'd developed Oliver! with Lionel Bart. I had to do The Adventurers instead\". Gilbert suggested Carol Reed might like Oliver! The Adventurers, a Harold Robbins tale was not a success. Things stayed out of kilter with Paramount. \"While doing this film, I signed to do The Godfather. Because of their financial problems, Paramount could only find $2m to make it. I said it needed $7m\". Instead, Gilbert made them a low-budget film called Friends. It did well, winning best foreign film at the Golden Globes. \"Paramount meanwhile had an unexpected hit in Love Story so they were back in the money. They could then spend properly on The Godfather. Coppola made it and the rest is history.\" Bond kept Gilbert busy for much of the 70s but in the following decade he aimed for more intimate fare. His wife Hylda - they've been married for 55 years - had once spotted Alfie. Now she suggested Willy Russell's play, Educating Rita. You'd think it easy to raise money if your last film was Moonraker. \"Yet everyone turned down Rita. Columbia wanted me to cast Dolly Parton as Rita\". When Gilbert had finished the film, he had US distributors fighting over it and was able to cut a deal that avoided the usual fatal subtraction. Rita won Gilbert another Bafta for best film, a distinction he shares with Richard Attenborough and John Schlesinger among his living British contemporaries. It also led him to another Russell play, Shirley Valentine. After its success, Bafta handed Gilbert the Michael Balcon award for his life's work. It's reputedly the Queen's favourite film. Certainly, Rex Reed - doyen of US critics - declared that Shirley Valentine proved Gilbert was \"the best woman's director since Cukor\". It's a phrase we no longer hear. Gilbert says it was once the highest praise. \"Women used to be the dominant force in cinema. Then, they chose the film and you made it for them. Nowadays films are mostly about two men\". He feels this masculinising of movies, caused by special effects, is the biggest change to the medium he's seen in his lifetime. So is he returning to \"women's pictures\" by taking Stephenson's adaptation of her play, The Memory of Water, which shoots this year? \"Not exactly. Although it's largely about three women, it's actually a comedy\". (The play won best new comedy at last month's Olivier Awards). Gilbert's output earned him a CBE in 1997 and the industry has honoured him handsomely, though he's never been fashionable. \"Maybe that's why I've endured. Fashion is something that doesn't last\". There's a nice twist to the tale though. Back in 1932, Gilbert played a lead in Dick Turpin with Victor McLaglen. Interviewed by the Star, a long-vanished London evening paper, he was asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. \"I want to be in films until I'm 80,\" he said. Not many of us fulfil our childhood dream.",

      "body": "<p>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that it's lunchtime. And let's say, for the sake of argument, that you're sitting in a New York diner, eating pastrami on rye - you work in an office, say, on Fifth Avenue - you're in advertising, or publishing. Or let's say you're grabbing a quick cheese sandwich between clients, in a brothel in Leipzig. Or you've got a moment or two to yourself, for a quiet smoke, just a quick break from selling your Baby Jesus snowstorms and \"What Would Jesus Do?\" bracelets from your souvenir kiosk at a dusty bus- stop in Bethlehem. Or it's time for noodles, kishimen, at a bench with 500 others in the canteen of a hypodermic needle incinerator factory on a light-industrial estate on the outskirts of Kyoto. Or it's a 3\"x12\" sub in a Polish-run caf\u00e9 by the beach on an unseasonably rainy day in St Kilda's, in Melbourne, Australia. </p> <p>And let's say, for the sake of argument, that you have a book propped up in front of you. You're trying not to stain the pages. Assuming it's not the new John Grisham or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, what is it? If you're a high-class German prostitute looking to make some serious money it might be <strong>Gewinnen mit Aktien</strong> by Bernd W Kl\u00f6ckner (Falken-Verlag, hardback, DM100). If you're chowing down in Kyoto it might be a Haruki Murakami. In Israel you might be tucking in to Moshe Bernstein's<strong> A Gedenk Licht </strong>(Peretz, hardback, $27). If you're in New York, and you can stomach a pitcher of schmaltz, you might be reading <strong>Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson </strong>by Mitch Albom(Doubleday, hardback, $21). If you're the Australian, you might be drooling your mayo over Sara Douglass's<strong> Crusader </strong>(Voyager, paperback, $19.95). Goodness only knows what it might be if you're in the Ukraine, Armenia, Turkmenistan or Bedford: whatever it is, it's unlikely to be familiar to your pen-friend in Malawi or Denmark. </p> <p>At a certain age, and at a certain stage of one's reading, even the most assiduous, the most compulsive of readers - the bibliomaniac - has to acknowledge that they can't read everything, unless they're Melvyn Bragg, of course, or Goethe. There comes a stage in one's reading when the only honest response to a friend's enthusing about his or her favourite author is to ask that which Harold Ross - son of an Ulsterman, who stood no nonsense - would scribble in the margins of the scripts and proofs at the New Yorker: \"Who he?\". </p> <p>Let's not pretend: when did you last read a book by any of the younger Russian novelists? You've read Victor Pelevin? Really? Chapaev i pustota, or the translation, <strong>The Clay Machine-Gun</strong> (Faber, \u00a39.99)? Did you finish it? Did you understand it? </p> <p>A vague knowledge, a passing familiarity, a limp handshake, an acquaintance with one's own national literature is about the best that most of us can manage. Most \"foreign books\" - or as some of the American chain bookstores have it, \"Literature Not Yet Translated\" - simply do not take up space in another nation's mind, let alone on its bookshelves. To be English or Scottish or Irish or Welsh and to have read French literature means to have spent a lifetime struggling through the obvious two or three dozen books that most French students would have skimmed, absorbed and discarded by the age of 18. It is of course always amusing to meet someone from the Czech Republic, say, or Hungary, and to hear them claim that the most exciting contemporary English novelist is Malcolm Bradbury, but then visit France and try enthusing about how much you've enjoyed Camus, or Georges Perec. \"Have you read Dominique Edd\u00e9?\" your French friend might ask. To which the only honest reply, for most of us, is \"Who she?\". </p> <p>Readers get stuck in a rut. If you happen to have been born in Britain, for example, the chances are you will, by your late teens and early 20s, have developed a ruinous taste for biography. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be addicted to the heavyweights, such as Richard Holmes's 432-page <strong>Coleridge: Early Visions </strong>(HarperCollins, hardback, \u00a315.99), or his 633-page <strong> Coleridge: Darker Reflections </strong> (HarperCollins, hardback, \u00a319.99). You might just be dipping in to the occasional Humphrey Carpenter at weekends - you can handle it. You may even be one of the few not itching with excitement at the thought of Martin Amis's <strong>Experience</strong>, forthcoming from Jonathan Cape (ISSN: 0224050605), and according to his publisher \"destined to become a classic\". </p> <p>It may simply mean that you are a mackintoshed habitu\u00e9 of the \"True Crime\" section in W H Smith, and are slowly, furtively adding over the years to your slightly stained bedside collection of books about the Krays, and serial killers, quietly stocking up, say, on <strong>Calling Time on the Krays: the Barmaid's Tale</strong> (Warner, \u00a36.99), by Mrs X, or Sandra Harrisson Young's <strong> Destined for Murder: Profiles of Six Serial Killers With Astrological Commentary</strong> (Llewelyn, \u00a310.99). Or it may only mean that you are a fan of the sub-autobiographical froth that sometimes passes for British fiction. </p> <p>Whatever the signs and symptoms, there's no doubt that biographies and autobiogra phies infest our small island, like rats and free local newspapers, and it's easy to see why. The legendary Leon Edel, Henry James's biographer, claimed that \"The secret of biography resides in finding the link between talent and achievement.\" The motive to discovering this link is what we amateur psychologists like to call envy, and everyone knows that envy grows rich and thick in damp, dark and crowded places like England. </p> <p>Imagine, though, that you had been born in Italy. Things might have been so different. Apart from wearing nicer shoes, you might have developed an enthusiasm for long poems in terza rima or for novels of great length and philosophical depth and distinction. On the other hand, you might have been born in Romania, and been seduced by Ionesco. </p> <p>Is it possible to overcome these limitations? The readers of the English-speaking nations have perhaps the greatest opportunity to do so - after all, we get a lot of books in translation, unlike, say, the 150,000 speakers of Gagauz in Moldavia, or the native Inuit, or the Cuzco Quechua speakers of Bolivia. These poor people may never get to read a book by Nick Hornby or Helen Fielding (but then again, the Bolivians have their epic drama, the Ollanta, and the West Greenlandic Inuit have a rich tradition of religious texts stretching back to the 18th century, which may be some consolation). </p> <p>The availability of books in translation may in fact be the problem. They queer the pitch. What sounds and reads like genius in the French can often seem like nothing but a moaning metaphysical drone when translated into English, and this may deter the reader from seeking out the original. Very often when reading books in translation, you have to make a huge effort to try and imagine the original texture and context and flavour, which has usually dried out or congealed in transit: it's like being faced with a black plastic plate of M&amp;S sushi fresh from Swindon and being asked to believe that you're eating Japanese food. It requires a willing suspension of disbelief. </p> <p>The literature of other nations, then, like the cuisine, and the children, always seems precocious, gross, too saucy, or simply dim-witted to the outsider. It's a sad fact, but literature often does not travel well - the manners and modes differ so greatly that they present a barrier to distant appreciation and understanding. This may explain, for example, why it is almost impossible for the English to understand American L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, or to really enjoy David Foster Wallace: you need to have been force-fed from an early age on Melville, Whitman, and Doctor Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham. </p> <p>These vast national differences and boundaries are reflected in miniature within states and nations, in the form of regional, ethnic, gender and class differences. It is of course unrealistic, although entertaining, to imagine that everyone within a particular country is inclined to read the same - there are many in Britain, for example, who suffer acute auto- and biographophobia. Ronald Reagan, returning from his tour of South America in 1982 is reported to have said, \"Well, I learned a lot... You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries\", and the same might now be said of what we used to call the United Kingdom. It may seem hard to credit it, but Colin Bateman is a very famous novelist in Northern Ireland, and there are people who regard the Poet Laureate as the greatest living English poet. </p> <p>There are even sub-cultures within sub-cultures. It is of course possible that someone working within a university but outside the Faculty of History might find occasion to consult the new five-volume <strong>Oxford History of the British Empire </strong> (Oxford University Press, hardback, \u00a330 per volume). But who but a handful of die-hards within the English Department will be bothering to read theoretician Stanley Fish's latest, <strong>The Trouble with Principle </strong> (Harvard University Press, hardback, $24.95)? And for that matter, who but a madman or a judge reads all the books on the Booker Prize shortlist? </p> <p> This is no excuse for complacency. Indeed, for all of these reasons, it is one's duty as a reader to beat one's own pathway through the great felled forests of the world's literature, and to avoid at all costs the easy, recommended routes and the quagmires of the bestseller lists. A bestseller list, after all, measures only so much bulk and wind, and when flicking through the New York or Sunday Times one should always be mindful of the old Russian proverb - shit floats. Publishers and booksellers like to pretend that they know what the public like and what the public want, but the public remains, as the public always was, a phantasm: it is less real, certainly less corporeal, than any one single woman, man or child. </p> <p>On World Book Day, then, pass on by the Waterstone's Recommends and refuse to click on Amazon's Hot 100. Try and forget the big names. Refuse the offerings of the major publishing houses, and disregard the sayings of pundits and reviewers - although, since you asked, I'm currently enjoying Ewen A Whitaker's <strong> Mapping and Naming the Moon: A History of Lunar Cartography and Nomenclature</strong> (Cambridge University Press, \u00a337.50), Eva Crane's <strong> The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting </strong> (Duckworth, \u00a385), Alison J Clarke's <strong> Tupperware: The Promise of Plastic in 1950s America </strong> (Smithsonian Institute Press, $24.95), Mary F Corey's<strong> The World Through a Monocle: the New Yorker at Mid-century </strong>(Harvard University Press, $25.95), Antonio Tabbuchi's <strong> Declares Pereira</strong> (Harvill, \u00a35.99), and <strong> Moby Dick</strong>, by Herman Melville (Penguin Books, \u00a31). Ignore this. Go teach yourself Gagauz - I can recommend the Ollanta.</p>",

And let's say, for the sake of argument, that you're sitting in a New York diner, eating pastrami on rye - you work in an office, say, on Fifth Avenue - you're in advertising, or publishing. Or let's say you're grabbing a quick cheese sandwich between clients, in a brothel in Leipzig. Or you've got a moment or two to yourself, for a quiet smoke, just a quick break from selling your Baby Jesus snowstorms and \"What Would Jesus Do?\" bracelets from your souvenir kiosk at a dusty bus- stop in Bethlehem. Or it's time for noodles, kishimen, at a bench with 500 others in the canteen of a hypodermic needle incinerator factory on a light-industrial estate on the outskirts of Kyoto. Or it's a 3\"x12\" sub in a Polish-run caf\u00e9 by the beach on an unseasonably rainy day in St Kilda's, in Melbourne, Australia. And let's say, for the sake of argument, that you have a book propped up in front of you. You're trying not to stain the pages. Assuming it's not the new John Grisham or Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, what is it? If you're a high-class German prostitute looking to make some serious money it might be Gewinnen mit Aktien by Bernd W Kl\u00f6ckner (Falken-Verlag, hardback, DM100). If you're chowing down in Kyoto it might be a Haruki Murakami. In Israel you might be tucking in to Moshe Bernstein's A Gedenk Licht (Peretz, hardback, $27). If you're in New York, and you can stomach a pitcher of schmaltz, you might be reading Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, A Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson by Mitch Albom(Doubleday, hardback, $21). If you're the Australian, you might be drooling your mayo over Sara Douglass's Crusader (Voyager, paperback, $19.95). Goodness only knows what it might be if you're in the Ukraine, Armenia, Turkmenistan or Bedford: whatever it is, it's unlikely to be familiar to your pen-friend in Malawi or Denmark. At a certain age, and at a certain stage of one's reading, even the most assiduous, the most compulsive of readers - the bibliomaniac - has to acknowledge that they can't read everything, unless they're Melvyn Bragg, of course, or Goethe. There comes a stage in one's reading when the only honest response to a friend's enthusing about his or her favourite author is to ask that which Harold Ross - son of an Ulsterman, who stood no nonsense - would scribble in the margins of the scripts and proofs at the New Yorker: \"Who he?\". Let's not pretend: when did you last read a book by any of the younger Russian novelists? You've read Victor Pelevin? Really? Chapaev i pustota, or the translation, The Clay Machine-Gun (Faber, \u00a39.99)? Did you finish it? Did you understand it? A vague knowledge, a passing familiarity, a limp handshake, an acquaintance with one's own national literature is about the best that most of us can manage. Most \"foreign books\" - or as some of the American chain bookstores have it, \"Literature Not Yet Translated\" - simply do not take up space in another nation's mind, let alone on its bookshelves. To be English or Scottish or Irish or Welsh and to have read French literature means to have spent a lifetime struggling through the obvious two or three dozen books that most French students would have skimmed, absorbed and discarded by the age of 18. It is of course always amusing to meet someone from the Czech Republic, say, or Hungary, and to hear them claim that the most exciting contemporary English novelist is Malcolm Bradbury, but then visit France and try enthusing about how much you've enjoyed Camus, or Georges Perec. \"Have you read Dominique Edd\u00e9?\" your French friend might ask. To which the only honest reply, for most of us, is \"Who she?\". Readers get stuck in a rut. If you happen to have been born in Britain, for example, the chances are you will, by your late teens and early 20s, have developed a ruinous taste for biography. This doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be addicted to the heavyweights, such as Richard Holmes's 432-page Coleridge: Early Visions (HarperCollins, hardback, \u00a315.99), or his 633-page Coleridge: Darker Reflections (HarperCollins, hardback, \u00a319.99). You might just be dipping in to the occasional Humphrey Carpenter at weekends - you can handle it. You may even be one of the few not itching with excitement at the thought of Martin Amis's Experience, forthcoming from Jonathan Cape (ISSN: 0224050605), and according to his publisher \"destined to become a classic\". It may simply mean that you are a mackintoshed habitu\u00e9 of the \"True Crime\" section in W H Smith, and are slowly, furtively adding over the years to your slightly stained bedside collection of books about the Krays, and serial killers, quietly stocking up, say, on Calling Time on the Krays: the Barmaid's Tale (Warner, \u00a36.99), by Mrs X, or Sandra Harrisson Young's Destined for Murder: Profiles of Six Serial Killers With Astrological Commentary (Llewelyn, \u00a310.99). Or it may only mean that you are a fan of the sub-autobiographical froth that sometimes passes for British fiction. Whatever the signs and symptoms, there's no doubt that biographies and autobiogra phies infest our small island, like rats and free local newspapers, and it's easy to see why. The legendary Leon Edel, Henry James's biographer, claimed that \"The secret of biography resides in finding the link between talent and achievement.\" The motive to discovering this link is what we amateur psychologists like to call envy, and everyone knows that envy grows rich and thick in damp, dark and crowded places like England. Imagine, though, that you had been born in Italy. Things might have been so different. Apart from wearing nicer shoes, you might have developed an enthusiasm for long poems in terza rima or for novels of great length and philosophical depth and distinction. On the other hand, you might have been born in Romania, and been seduced by Ionesco. Is it possible to overcome these limitations? The readers of the English-speaking nations have perhaps the greatest opportunity to do so - after all, we get a lot of books in translation, unlike, say, the 150,000 speakers of Gagauz in Moldavia, or the native Inuit, or the Cuzco Quechua speakers of Bolivia. These poor people may never get to read a book by Nick Hornby or Helen Fielding (but then again, the Bolivians have their epic drama, the Ollanta, and the West Greenlandic Inuit have a rich tradition of religious texts stretching back to the 18th century, which may be some consolation). The availability of books in translation may in fact be the problem. They queer the pitch. What sounds and reads like genius in the French can often seem like nothing but a moaning metaphysical drone when translated into English, and this may deter the reader from seeking out the original. Very often when reading books in translation, you have to make a huge effort to try and imagine the original texture and context and flavour, which has usually dried out or congealed in transit: it's like being faced with a black plastic plate of M&amp;S sushi fresh from Swindon and being asked to believe that you're eating Japanese food. It requires a willing suspension of disbelief. The literature of other nations, then, like the cuisine, and the children, always seems precocious, gross, too saucy, or simply dim-witted to the outsider. It's a sad fact, but literature often does not travel well - the manners and modes differ so greatly that they present a barrier to distant appreciation and understanding. This may explain, for example, why it is almost impossible for the English to understand American L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry, or to really enjoy David Foster Wallace: you need to have been force-fed from an early age on Melville, Whitman, and Doctor Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham. These vast national differences and boundaries are reflected in miniature within states and nations, in the form of regional, ethnic, gender and class differences. It is of course unrealistic, although entertaining, to imagine that everyone within a particular country is inclined to read the same - there are many in Britain, for example, who suffer acute auto- and biographophobia. Ronald Reagan, returning from his tour of South America in 1982 is reported to have said, \"Well, I learned a lot... You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries\", and the same might now be said of what we used to call the United Kingdom. It may seem hard to credit it, but Colin Bateman is a very famous novelist in Northern Ireland, and there are people who regard the Poet Laureate as the greatest living English poet. There are even sub-cultures within sub-cultures. It is of course possible that someone working within a university but outside the Faculty of History might find occasion to consult the new five-volume Oxford History of the British Empire (Oxford University Press, hardback, \u00a330 per volume). But who but a handful of die-hards within the English Department will be bothering to read theoretician Stanley Fish's latest, The Trouble with Principle (Harvard University Press, hardback, $24.95)? And for that matter, who but a madman or a judge reads all the books on the Booker Prize shortlist? This is no excuse for complacency. Indeed, for all of these reasons, it is one's duty as a reader to beat one's own pathway through the great felled forests of the world's literature, and to avoid at all costs the easy, recommended routes and the quagmires of the bestseller lists. A bestseller list, after all, measures only so much bulk and wind, and when flicking through the New York or Sunday Times one should always be mindful of the old Russian proverb - shit floats. Publishers and booksellers like to pretend that they know what the public like and what the public want, but the public remains, as the public always was, a phantasm: it is less real, certainly less corporeal, than any one single woman, man or child. On World Book Day, then, pass on by the Waterstone's Recommends and refuse to click on Amazon's Hot 100. Try and forget the big names. Refuse the offerings of the major publishing houses, and disregard the sayings of pundits and reviewers - although, since you asked, I'm currently enjoying Ewen A Whitaker's Mapping and Naming the Moon: A History of Lunar Cartography and Nomenclature (Cambridge University Press, \u00a337.50), Eva Crane's The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting (Duckworth, \u00a385), Alison J Clarke's Tupperware: The Promise of Plastic in 1950s America (Smithsonian Institute Press, $24.95), Mary F Corey's The World Through a Monocle: the New Yorker at Mid-century (Harvard University Press, $25.95), Antonio Tabbuchi's Declares Pereira (Harvill, \u00a35.99), and Moby Dick, by Herman Melville (Penguin Books, \u00a31). Ignore this. Go teach yourself Gagauz - I can recommend the Ollanta.",

Kitchen is at heart an oblique love story, soft-hearted but entirely slop-free. It covers topics like grief, tenderness and friendship with a wonder fully fresh eye. It doesn't look like anything in the western frame of reference. It's lyrical at times but with a fair share of gross behaviour, black comedy and a nicely sensual undertow. The story is simple. A girl, distraught at the death of her grandmother and in danger of eviction is taken in by an unconventional club-owner and her stroppy, hairdresser son. Being from Hong Kong rather than China, weird bits of east-west juxtaposition add to the appeal: lava lamps and the ludicrous New Romantic-style hairdo of our hero look strangely familiar and English phrases creep into the Chinese dialogue (\"NO means no\", \"see you later\" \"bye-bye\"). At one stage the characters burst into a rendition of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. Kitchen is a reflective film. The one piece of violent action is in dreamlike slow-motion. It's beautifully played by Jordan Chan as Louie - a character you see developing - and captivating Japanese actress Yasuko Tomita. Writer- director Yim Ho shares the love of interiors and textures that was a feature of Wong-Kar Wai's Chungking Express as well as a fluid, less hyperactive camera style.

But we all assume that anyway and Michael Patrick Jann's film only really made me laugh when it went one step beyond on the taste front: last year's winner of the Mount Rose pageant has to be wheeled out of the anorexia clinic to hand over her crown, for example, while Denise Richards's routine includes a Mount Rushmore headdress and a dance routine with a plastic Christ on the cross (nobody ever lost a US beauty contest by being too patriotic or too religious). But everyone except Richards's main rival, Kirsten Dunst, is more stereotype than character. The best lines mostly go to Allison Janney as the acerbic best friend of Dunst's alcoholic mother.

Responding to anxieties that up to 6,000 job cuts were on the cards at DKB, the chairman of the old Deutsche Bank and joint chief executive of the new company - bearing the same name - said: \"Any fears in London are absolute rubbish. </p> <p>\"We have no idea whatsoever to close or sell Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. It is a jewel and we want to keep that jewel,\" said Rolf Breuer, who admitted he would step down as joint chief executive in 2002. </p> <p>While his words appeared to be reassuring, they did little to boost sentiment yesterday at DKB's operation in London where many still felt resigned to redundancy. While the two banks saw the deal as a merger of equals, the ratio for existing shareholders in the banks is likely to be 60-40 in Deutsche's favour. </p> <p>In total the combined bank will shed 16,000 jobs from its 140,000 workforce over a three-year period as it streamlines its domestic branch network with the help of Allianz, the German insurance group which holds stakes in both banks. With the exception of its fund management business, every operation is to be restructured to remove overlaps in an effort to squeeze out \u20ac2.9bn of costs a year. </p> <p>While Mr Breuer heralded the deal as the beginning of consolidation in the German market, it can also be expected to put pressure on his rivals in Europe. The new Deutsche will be second in terms of stock market size in Europe only to HSBC, bigger than Lloyds TSB and UBS of Switzerland. </p> <p>Mr Breuer said the deal was good for Germany as a whole by creating \"a European powerhouse\". His counterpart at Dresdner Bank, Bernhard Walter, backed rejection of City rumours about Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's fate, describing them as \"pure and utter nonsense\" </p> <p>Both German banks have built up their investment banking presence by buying up top City names, Deutsche through Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner in acquiring Kleinwort Benson. </p> <p>Mr Breuer admitted yesterday that Dresdner's acquisition had been more successful than his bank's deal with Morgan Grenfell although he had learned from the mistakes of the past through the recent purchase of Bankers Trust of the United States which involved 5,500 job cuts last year. </p> <p>\"In hindsight the Kleinwort Benson deal went more smoothly than Morgan Grenfell,\" Mr Breuer said, admitting that Deutsche had been too slow to integrate Morgan Grenfell - whose name has now been eradicated from the City - with its own operations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank yesterday insisted Dresdner Kleinwort Benson was a \"jewel\" and not an investment bank threatened by closure following its \u20ac80bn (\u00a350bn) groundbreaking merger with its smaller domestic rival. Deutsche admitted 1,600 investment banking jobs face the axe across its operations in London and New York, but refused to indicate how many of them would be lost in the City where the two investment banks employ more than 12,000 people. Responding to anxieties that up to 6,000 job cuts were on the cards at DKB, the chairman of the old Deutsche Bank and joint chief executive of the new company - bearing the same name - said: \"Any fears in London are absolute rubbish. \"We have no idea whatsoever to close or sell Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. It is a jewel and we want to keep that jewel,\" said Rolf Breuer, who admitted he would step down as joint chief executive in 2002. While his words appeared to be reassuring, they did little to boost sentiment yesterday at DKB's operation in London where many still felt resigned to redundancy. While the two banks saw the deal as a merger of equals, the ratio for existing shareholders in the banks is likely to be 60-40 in Deutsche's favour. In total the combined bank will shed 16,000 jobs from its 140,000 workforce over a three-year period as it streamlines its domestic branch network with the help of Allianz, the German insurance group which holds stakes in both banks. With the exception of its fund management business, every operation is to be restructured to remove overlaps in an effort to squeeze out \u20ac2.9bn of costs a year. While Mr Breuer heralded the deal as the beginning of consolidation in the German market, it can also be expected to put pressure on his rivals in Europe. The new Deutsche will be second in terms of stock market size in Europe only to HSBC, bigger than Lloyds TSB and UBS of Switzerland. Mr Breuer said the deal was good for Germany as a whole by creating \"a European powerhouse\". His counterpart at Dresdner Bank, Bernhard Walter, backed rejection of City rumours about Dresdner Kleinwort Benson's fate, describing them as \"pure and utter nonsense\" Both German banks have built up their investment banking presence by buying up top City names, Deutsche through Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner in acquiring Kleinwort Benson. Mr Breuer admitted yesterday that Dresdner's acquisition had been more successful than his bank's deal with Morgan Grenfell although he had learned from the mistakes of the past through the recent purchase of Bankers Trust of the United States which involved 5,500 job cuts last year. \"In hindsight the Kleinwort Benson deal went more smoothly than Morgan Grenfell,\" Mr Breuer said, admitting that Deutsche had been too slow to integrate Morgan Grenfell - whose name has now been eradicated from the City - with its own operations.",

The DTI announced it will provide a loan under the home shipbuilding credit guarantee system for up to 80% of the value of the contract. </p> <p>It is believed to be the largest ever such loan and is repayable on completion.

      "body": "<p>In 1967 Susanna Kaysen, instead of heading for a prestigious American university, checked into a mental hospital. The 18-year-old had taken a bottle of aspirin chased with a bottle of vodka, and there were bad bruises on her wrists. She signed herself into McLean hospital outside Boston and spent the next two years on a ward for teenage girls. Actually, make that rich, privileged, teenage girls. These are no crazed low-lifes; they are the nice but troubled daughters of even nicer (and probably more troubled) parents. </p> <p>From that stay came first Kaysen's best-selling memoir, Girl, Interrupted, and now the screen version starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. This is not One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in cashmere twinsets. It is a pitch-perfect take on a very American conceit: that going crazy in a controlled, socially acceptable, relatively well-dressed way is, well, kind of romantic. </p> <p>The story begins at a pivotal point in Susanna's life. She is on the brink of graduation from high school and without direction. We know hers is a good school: not only is she the only member of her class not going on to college, but she is the first person in the history of the place not to go on to higher education. Susanna's pals belong on campuses that make up the east coast's fabled Seven Sisters, such as Wellesley, Radcliffe, and Vassar. Susanna's path is decidedly less social. She \"plans to write\". And write she does, through her endless hours on the ward. There is certainly no shortage of material. </p> <p>The girls of Claymoore (as the hospital is renamed) - Daisy, Georgina, Polly, Lisa and Susanna - are an awkward yet vivid bunch. They are the moneyed miserable, the cared-for neglected, the loved unwanted. The movie and the book ask you to root for them. It's a tough sell. Not because the characters don't deserve our compassion, they do. Georgina is a pathological liar; Polly once doused herself with gasoline and then tossed the match; Daisy has a pitiful eating disorder, the tip of a large iceberg; Lisa is a sociopath. These young women are clinging to wire-mesh windows instead of going on dates or learning to live on their own. But the very idea of them seems to beg for some championship eye-rolling. Kaysen's assessment of her situation is tart and clear-eyed, \"Angst of these dimensions is a luxury item. You need to be well-fed, clothed, and housed to have time for this much self-pity.\" </p> <p>For all its prep-school winsomeness, the film is deftly cast. Winona may have sworn off \"teen angst bullshit\" some time after Heathers, but this is her story to tell (she was co-producer) and no one treads the line between pissed off and repentant better. Her Susanna's ennui is of the finest porcelain. Ryder herself skipped college and put herself briefly into a facility where she could take time out from her rampag ing early fame, as well as get a good night's sleep. Jolie's depiction of Lisa has earned her an Oscar nomination. </p> <p>The girls' link between the solipsism of mental illness and the world beyond the ward is a nurse called Valerie, played with typical stoicism by Whoopi Goldberg. Her diagnosis of Susanna's condition is more Sister Act than Sigmund Freud: \"You are a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who's driving herself crazy\". The viewer can't help but agree.It's hard to tell whether Susanna is truly sick or not. In the late-60s, depression, homosexuality and resistance to marrying appliance salesmen, could all be deemed signs of clinical mental instability. </p> <p>For the audience, though, there is something else going on, something far more relevant to our lives than the shaky constitution of a well-read, sensitive girl. A doctor advises Susanna: \"You need a genuine rest,\" and in the dark of the cinema, we'll all be sighing, \"Doctor, who doesn't?\" Watching 1967 from 2000, we don't see a tough road back to health, we see a vacation. Ryder shuffles around in darling Peter Pan collars and natty black pants, her pixie-ish haircut sweeping stylishly off her glowing face. When not tricked out in the dream student wardrobe - cardigans, sneakers, pea coats - Ryder curls up in cute pyjamas. Smoking, pyjamas, all-day television: this is a spot-on description of the residents of my college dorm most days. </p> <p>Even Kaysen says in her book, 'For many of us, the hospital was as much a refuge as it was a prison. Though we were all cut off from the world, we were also cut off from the demands and expectations that had driven us crazy ... As long as we were willing to be upset, we didn't have to get jobs or go to school. We could weasel out of anything except eating and taking our medication.\" </p> <p>Substitute cruise ship or religious retreat for hospital and you're getting closer to the real allure of checking out, or rather checking in. Imagine the comfy white clothes, courtesy of Donna Karan's new Pure line, minimalist decor, and low sodium cuisine. Valerie lays out the set-up and neatly voices the audience's sentiments: \"I worked in a state-run hospital. This is a five star hotel.\" And let's face it, aren't five star hotels and spas actually low-security asylums? Where does group therapy end and Club Med begin? </p> <p>But Susanna is on a different trip. \"It's so nice to go insane, no one asks you to explain,\" sang Helen Reddy in her creepy 1974 hit, Angie Baby. Susanna could hardly have chosen a better site than McLean's for her tutelage. Other former clients include musicians James Taylor and Ray Charles and poets Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath. (Taylor's classic Fire and Rain was written about a girl he met while in McLean.) Susanna's goals are simple and reasonable. She intends to make a life out of boyfriends and literature and she exposes her roman tic predilections early. In getting to know her new roommate, Georgina (Clea Duvall), Susanna explains that her brand of cigarettes is Gauloises: \"The French Resistance smoked them, I think.\" She keeps a diary, develops a worshipful crush on crazier-than-thou Lisa, and mourns a boyfriend whose draft number is due up any time. </p> <p>F Scott Fitzgerald's novel Tender is the Night, about his unstable wife Zelda, portrays the beauty of the half-mad heroine. And sure enough, Scotty and Zelda's breakdowns became a profound influence on his work, not to mention his literary legend. From southern gothic to Northern Exposure, kookiness is how we get our kicks. America can, after all, be an inauthentic place and craziness is one way to get real. Rather than be repelled by the harpy in the attic, we long to be the first Mrs Rochester. Not for us the centred, resolute Jane, forever doing right and never pitching a fit. In the 1970 movie Diary of a Mad Housewife, for example, there was only one character in the whole business worth knowing - the one having the meltdown. Dorothy Parker's depression, William Burroughs's drug habit and Kurt Cobain's alienation all bear witness to an emotional life not encouraged in the scrubbed suburbs. How else can we explain Depeche Mode's unflagging popularity in the Los Angeles basin? </p> <p>The most significant graduate of McLean's psychological finishing school was Sylvia Plath. It has been said, cruelly, that suicide was her smartest career move. It is probably just a coincidence that both Ryder's Kaysen and Plath travelled with matched white Samsonite luggage. As a symbol of middle-class normalcy and order, there are few neater. Emotional baggage indeed. </p> <p>There is something downright literary about the girls' school experience in a country where such adventures are rare. If the defining run at rebellion can't be unleashed at boarding school (if you are super-rich), it can be a sorority house - author Joan Didion was a Tri Delt at Berkeley - or it can wait until that first job in publishing. Or, a clean mental hospital where you can have your own room. Setting yourself against even the puny establishment of an all-girl's dorm may be as close as some girls ever get to challenging their status quo. Defiance, yes, but also a comforting togetherness. </p> <p>Next up on the angst front is Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, The Virgin Suicides, about a family of beautiful, mysterious suicidal sisters. With a soundtrack by Air and a story filtered through the hip gauze of Coppola's retro-savvy, this adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides's novel set in the 70s American suburban Elysium should add a dark new spin to the form.</p> <p>\u0095 Girl, Interrupted is released on March 24</p>",

History ranges from a biography of Phillip V by Yale historian Henry Kamen, to a new book on Charles V, Man and Emperor, by home-grown historian Manuel Fernandez Alvarez, linked to the 500th anniversary of Charles's birth this year. Among the novels that are riding high are La Agonia del Dragon (The Agony of The Dragon), by Juan Luis Cebriana (a former editor of Spain's leading newspaper El Pa\u00eds), set during Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy in the 70s.

In All The Names, a registry officer's obsession with reconstruction sets him on the trail of a woman with no history.

Simon Rattle's decade-long survey of the 20th century has been transmuted into HearNow, signalling that as well as summarising the music of the 1990s the series is looking forward with premieres of specially commissioned scores in each concert. </p> <p>So for the opening concert last night, Mark-Anthony Turnage's Blood on the Floor, first heard in 1997, was prefaced by Magnus Lindberg's brand new Gran Duo, a remarkable 20-minute movement for woodwind and brass alone, with a scoring that is practically identical to that of Stravinsky's masterpiece Symphonies of Wind Instruments. </p> <p>Lindberg begins with an explicit reference to that archetype, but after that goes his own way entirely, save for a tiny homage, more a passing colour than a quote, to Sibelius's tone poem Tapiola.

      "bodyText": "For its final flourish, Towards the Millennium has changed its name. Simon Rattle's decade-long survey of the 20th century has been transmuted into HearNow, signalling that as well as summarising the music of the 1990s the series is looking forward with premieres of specially commissioned scores in each concert. So for the opening concert last night, Mark-Anthony Turnage's Blood on the Floor, first heard in 1997, was prefaced by Magnus Lindberg's brand new Gran Duo, a remarkable 20-minute movement for woodwind and brass alone, with a scoring that is practically identical to that of Stravinsky's masterpiece Symphonies of Wind Instruments. Lindberg begins with an explicit reference to that archetype, but after that goes his own way entirely, save for a tiny homage, more a passing colour than a quote, to Sibelius's tone poem Tapiola. The music is a wonderful mosaic of interlocking blocks of material, each with its own sharply defined character, which speed up and slow down to generate constantly changing patterns and alliances. It is a treacherous combination of instruments to write for: at the start the woodwind and brass are sharply contrasted, but over the course of the five continuous sections they are gradually reconciled, and the final, gruff chorale is a wonderful melding of colours and magical harmonic shifts. The Royal Festival Hall acoustics did no favours to the meticulously balanced textures of Gran Duo, and the score would sound even more impressive in a smaller, warmer space.
