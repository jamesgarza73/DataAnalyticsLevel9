Very Lite. Just one calorie - if that. Nurse Betty is a screwball-comedy-cum-road-movie which could have been made at any time in the last 30 years, and is encumbered with the bafflingly dated and unoriginal theme of how TV subverts reality. Only the abrasive, recalcitrant presence of Chris Rock gives this film anything resembling the contemporary edge that we are hoping for in a Neil LaBute picture, and alerts us to the fact that all this is supposed to be happening in the year 2000. </p> <p>Whether or not the \"throwback\" quality of Nurse Betty is accidental, some of it is certainly attributable to the fact that it starts off in the sheltered mid-west of Fair Oaks, Kansas, where diner waitress Betty (Zellweger) regularly swoons over her favourite daytime soap, A Reason to Love, starring the dishy actor George McCord (Greg Kinnear) who plays the unfeasibly handsome Dr David Ravell. </p> <p>Zellweger is so sweet and innocent as to have almost stepped from one of the ads that would intersperse the show.

Del's two assassins are Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock), who happen to have a large quantity of drugs hidden in the back of a stolen car that Del is illegally trying to re-introduce to the \"pre-owned\" market.</p> <p>But seeing Del's bloody despatch sends poor Betty over the edge; in a state of traumatised shock, she believes herself to be Nurse Betty, the one true love of Dr David Ravell, and she resolves to drive to Los Angeles to find him and marry him. Naturally she takes the car with the drugs hidden in it, so Charlie and Wesley head off after her in pursuit, with Charlie nursing a yearning, obsessive, late-menopausal interest in the kind of woman Betty might be. </p> <p>It's the death of Del that is the saddest and most frustrating thing about Nurse Betty: very early on, the grit is removed from the oyster, and the film's one authentically nasty person is deleted. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock aren't real bad guys; Freeman is sold to us as the purveyor of gentle, weary wisdom, underlined by the half-smile and the half-moon spectacles that Hollywood generally assigns to the Token Black Judge character, and Rock is the streetwise avatar of comedy cool. </p> <p>From there on in, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger floats alone in a bubble of space-cadet kookiness, without the dramatic interest of enforced intimacy with a genuinely unpleasant character. </p> <p>Zellweger has the cutesy, squeaky, semi-strangulated voice that is a few notches up the caricature-scale from the voice she had in Jerry Maguire, and it's all part of what her would-be assailants call the \"Doris Day thing\" that she has going.</p> <p>It is actually a very finely wrought and professionally executed character study from Zellweger, whose brio and charm persuades you, more or less, to buy the plot's trickiest element: Betty finally meeting her TV hero in the flesh, and him believing that she is a method actress auditioning for a part in the programme. As Nurse Betty, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger emerges as a very accomplished performer and comedian. Her performance really grows on you throughout, with an accretion of engaging little touches. </p> <p>But, really, what is the point of Nurse Betty? There is such a curious air of redundant social commentary and satire about the whole enterprise. It's as if the film expects plaudits for the allegedly funky idea of TV invading reality; but this was a talking point around the time of The Killing of Sister George (1968) or Network (1976) and John Sayles's excellent and under-rated 1992 film Passion Fish was much more interesting and original about the existence of a daytime soap star.</p> <p>If Nurse Betty is Neil LaBute's bid for the mainstream, then maybe its watery similarity to his tougher, more astringent earlier work has at least a certain consistency. Another director might simply have taken on a more thoroughly commercial picture, and regarded it as a pay-packet to subsidise his more heartfelt ventures.

Whatever one thinks of Shaw's five-part journey from part to future, David Fielding's heavily cut, brilliantly visual Royal Shakespeare Company production certainly proves it can hold its place on the modern stage. </p> <p>An admired colleague this week classified Shaw as \"evil\", fit to be ranked alongside Hitler: he cited as part of his case this supposedly barmy vision of a long-life utopia dominated by pure thought. But, with all respect, this is a misreading of Shaw. Back to Methuselah, which he finished in 1921, is based on two strong Shavian emotions: detestation of the social consequences of Darwinism and despair at the horrors unleashed by the first world war. Shaw believed that western civilisation was doomed. His answer was to come up with a scientific religion, Creative Evolution, in which mankind through will and imagination achieved longevity and wisdom. Optimistically naive perhaps but scarcely evil. </p> <p>Seeing Back to Methuselah, what also hits one is Shaw's subversive humour and ability to question his own thesis. The Garden of Eden offers an ironised Genesis with Adam and Eve happily escaping \"the burden of immortality\". In the second and funniest of the plays, set in 1920s London, we see how the rejection of biological determinism by the Brothers Barnabas is turned into an election slogan by opportunist Liberal politicians. </p> <p>If Shaw's vision of the future arouses qualms, one can only say that he himself seems to share them. In the fourth play, set in Galway in 3000 AD, the newly evolved long-livers are humourless automatons who advocate extermination of the unfit. Shaw's ultimate glimpse of Arcadia, where the young are born out of eggs, where art and music are transient delights and where the He and She-Ancients are sexless, hairless and passionless, is also calculatedly repellent. Shaw is writing out of despair at human folly; but, having created a radical blueprint for the future, he implies that the price of a willed longevity may be a decorous sterility. </p> <p>In realising Shaw's vision, Fielding's production offers its own criticism. The evening is presented as if it were a laboratory experiment, starting with a scientist flinging a dead fawn onto the Edenic stage. And when we get to the final play, with its unisex long-livers and mitred ancients in topless sheaths, we sense that death might be preferable to this joyless paradise. </p> <p>Andrew Walsh's designs skilfully use videogames and shape-shifting computerised images to question Shaw's futuristic vision. And the cast, leaping from aeon to aeon, do a remarkable job. Julian Curry moves easily from a Hampstead evolutionist to a gender-transcending ancient, Caroline Harris starts as a jump-suited Eve and ends as an artificially-recreated Cleopatra, while Adam Levy throughout embodies the kind of male militarism Shaw detests. You may not be persuaded by Shaw's vision of Creative Evolution, but the surprise revelation of this four-hour, unpredictably enjoyable evening is that neither was Shaw himself. </p> <p> Until October 7.

      "body": "<p>The following reviews aim to give a rough guide to just a few of the many short film sites out there. Content and sites change; our reviewers' comments are what they found when they visited the sites during September 2000. All sites were tested on PCs and and macs and with both dial-up modem and broadband connections. We welcome your comments, and if you would like us to review your site, please email us at film.feedback@guardianunlimited.co.uk.</p> <p>Reviews by Kate Stables, Sean Dodson, Emma Yates and Imogen Tilden.</p> <p><a href=\"http://panushka.absolutvodka.com/\">Absolut Panushka</a><br>An online experimental animation festival that featured 32 films in 1998. Still live, still worth a look - in spite of all the films being about a very famous brand of Swedish vodka.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.afilmcinado.net/\">afilmcinado.net</a><br>A well-intentioned but sparsely stocked \"alternative\" site, which was concentrating largely on German shorts at our last glance. Horribly slow downloads (even with a broadband connection) meant that we couldn't gauge how trippy Irish thriller The Trip was intended to be. RealPlayer and QuickTime options are offered, but be prepared for a unhealthy wait between clicking and viewing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alwaysindependentfilms.com/\">always independent</a><br>A good selection of independent movies from minute-long shorts to full-length features. Also includes a classic film section that - if you have the patience - streams old black and whites like The Three Stooges' Brideless Groom and Chaplin's The Gold Rush. You'll need a Windows Media Player to see the majority of them (sorry, mac users).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com/browsersafe/\">AtomFilms</a><br>Probably the most famous and most visited short film site on the Web. Atom's comprehensive choice and popular content make it a good place to learn what you enjoy - and what you want to avoid - in the world of webfilm. Roam all over this vast and varied site, to sample work running from Oscar nominated shorts, through festival favourites and foreign films, to \"extreme\" interactive animations. To see more than featured picks requires registration as an Atom Insider, which is free and doesn't (to date) result in a tsunami of junk email. All streaming video formats are catered for. Gadget freaks can have shorts sent to their personal digital organizer or WAP phone, to stun the bus queue.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bijoucafe.com/\">Bijou Cafe</a><br>Movie lovers with a taste for kitsch cinema will love this site - as long as they have access to a superfast connection. Bijou Cafe stream old feature-length movies from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in Horror Express to transvestite classic Glen or Glenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.binarytheater.com/\">BinaryTheater</a><br>A cheerful American single page site with half a dozen titles, all under 15 minutes. Its raison d'\u00eatre is to give free, unlimited distribution to the best work from US film schools. We'd guess that the cream of US film school shorts pour headlong onto higher-profile sites like Atom and IFilm, but if you have a RealVideo plugin, this is worth a quick look.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebitscreen.com/\">The Bit Screen<br></a>Convince yourself that the web is the next broadcast medium, by stopping in at The Bit Screen. Owner Nora Barry has a messianic interest in first run web-specific work, and this is the place to pick up on interactive artistic novelties like self-assembly webfilms. Look out for Random Shuffles - films programmed to reconfigure for each successive site visitor. Succulent animations were programmed when we visited, including Billy Blob's stylised satire Darwin Bug. Four works are featured every week, which can be viewed using Shockwave or RealPlayer, but there's no on-site archive</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.campchaos.com/\"><br>Camp Chaos</a><br>Cartoonist Bob Cesca's web HQ, and home to his set of energetic, taste-free Flash cartoon series, which are updated weekly. Lovers of American \"extreme content\" animation will fall giggling onto his topical spoofs, but we preferred Mafia series This Thing of Ours. Browse through Public Domain Theater, which marries cheesy black and white B-movie footage with parody voiceover, should you have the time. If you can't hear anything, check you've updated your Flash plugin.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.culturejam.com/\">Culturejam</a><br>Culturejam is that counter-culture curiosity, a site dedicated to streaming subversive media to the masses. A welcome shot of guerilla media is delivered in a single RealPlayer short film, highlighting the issue of the week. Sticking it to the military-industrial complex when we showed up was the mind-expander's manifesto Mother May I ? (Control My Own Consciousness). There's no film archive on site, so counter-media connoisseurs will need to demonstrate solidarity by regular attendance.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfilm.com/\"><br>D.Film</a><br>Now grown up from its diminutive indie roots into a fully fledged festival and supporting website, D.film picks one film a month to showcase. Recent highlights include an excerpt from The Week Before, a beautiful, slow-moving silent movie about God in the seven days before he created the earth, and Mutate, by British director Jack Price. Each film offers you the option of downloading it or watching it via streaming QuickTime.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.directorunknown.com/\"><br>Director Unknown</a><br>Using a Dogme '95-style manifesto to create a \"movie of the web\", six young American film-makers have put together a fresh but flakey 12-episode RealPlayer thriller on this site. Each short episode was shot in a day by a member of the collective, and sometimes - inevitably - it shows. Watch their Lynchian streamed video in episode order, using a broadband connection if at all possible.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.evanmather.com/html/index0.html\">Evan Mather</a><br>The delightful and diverse offerings of prolific short film-maker Evan Mather, packed into a single page site, both Mac and PC-friendly.

Content and sites change; our reviewers' comments are what they found when they visited the sites during September 2000. All sites were tested on PCs and and macs and with both dial-up modem and broadband connections. We welcome your comments, and if you would like us to review your site, please email us at film.feedback@guardianunlimited.co.uk. Reviews by Kate Stables, Sean Dodson, Emma Yates and Imogen Tilden. Absolut Panushka An online experimental animation festival that featured 32 films in 1998. Still live, still worth a look - in spite of all the films being about a very famous brand of Swedish vodka. afilmcinado.net A well-intentioned but sparsely stocked \"alternative\" site, which was concentrating largely on German shorts at our last glance. Horribly slow downloads (even with a broadband connection) meant that we couldn't gauge how trippy Irish thriller The Trip was intended to be. RealPlayer and QuickTime options are offered, but be prepared for a unhealthy wait between clicking and viewing. always independent A good selection of independent movies from minute-long shorts to full-length features. Also includes a classic film section that - if you have the patience - streams old black and whites like The Three Stooges' Brideless Groom and Chaplin's The Gold Rush. You'll need a Windows Media Player to see the majority of them (sorry, mac users). AtomFilms Probably the most famous and most visited short film site on the Web. Atom's comprehensive choice and popular content make it a good place to learn what you enjoy - and what you want to avoid - in the world of webfilm. Roam all over this vast and varied site, to sample work running from Oscar nominated shorts, through festival favourites and foreign films, to \"extreme\" interactive animations. To see more than featured picks requires registration as an Atom Insider, which is free and doesn't (to date) result in a tsunami of junk email. All streaming video formats are catered for. Gadget freaks can have shorts sent to their personal digital organizer or WAP phone, to stun the bus queue. Bijou Cafe Movie lovers with a taste for kitsch cinema will love this site - as long as they have access to a superfast connection. Bijou Cafe stream old feature-length movies from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in Horror Express to transvestite classic Glen or Glenda. BinaryTheater A cheerful American single page site with half a dozen titles, all under 15 minutes. Its raison d'\u00eatre is to give free, unlimited distribution to the best work from US film schools. We'd guess that the cream of US film school shorts pour headlong onto higher-profile sites like Atom and IFilm, but if you have a RealVideo plugin, this is worth a quick look. The Bit Screen Convince yourself that the web is the next broadcast medium, by stopping in at The Bit Screen. Owner Nora Barry has a messianic interest in first run web-specific work, and this is the place to pick up on interactive artistic novelties like self-assembly webfilms. Look out for Random Shuffles - films programmed to reconfigure for each successive site visitor. Succulent animations were programmed when we visited, including Billy Blob's stylised satire Darwin Bug. Four works are featured every week, which can be viewed using Shockwave or RealPlayer, but there's no on-site archive Camp Chaos Cartoonist Bob Cesca's web HQ, and home to his set of energetic, taste-free Flash cartoon series, which are updated weekly. Lovers of American \"extreme content\" animation will fall giggling onto his topical spoofs, but we preferred Mafia series This Thing of Ours. Browse through Public Domain Theater, which marries cheesy black and white B-movie footage with parody voiceover, should you have the time. If you can't hear anything, check you've updated your Flash plugin. Culturejam Culturejam is that counter-culture curiosity, a site dedicated to streaming subversive media to the masses. A welcome shot of guerilla media is delivered in a single RealPlayer short film, highlighting the issue of the week. Sticking it to the military-industrial complex when we showed up was the mind-expander's manifesto Mother May I ? (Control My Own Consciousness). There's no film archive on site, so counter-media connoisseurs will need to demonstrate solidarity by regular attendance. D.Film Now grown up from its diminutive indie roots into a fully fledged festival and supporting website, D.film picks one film a month to showcase. Recent highlights include an excerpt from The Week Before, a beautiful, slow-moving silent movie about God in the seven days before he created the earth, and Mutate, by British director Jack Price. Each film offers you the option of downloading it or watching it via streaming QuickTime. Director Unknown Using a Dogme '95-style manifesto to create a \"movie of the web\", six young American film-makers have put together a fresh but flakey 12-episode RealPlayer thriller on this site. Each short episode was shot in a day by a member of the collective, and sometimes - inevitably - it shows. Watch their Lynchian streamed video in episode order, using a broadband connection if at all possible. Evan Mather The delightful and diverse offerings of prolific short film-maker Evan Mather, packed into a single page site, both Mac and PC-friendly. He made his name with surreal Star Wars parodies like Les Pantless Menace, one of a series of lo-tech spoofs stuffed with plastic figurines and disco soundtracks. If these crowd-pleasers leave you cold, try out his funky, rough-edged animations, such as Fansom The Lizard. An excellent antidote to the plague of one-joke Flash cartoons that friends insist on cramming into your email inbox with. Flash Film Festival The showcase site for New York's July 2000 Flash Film Festival, which \"honoured the best motion graphics and animation on earth\". Although the festival has been and gone, you can still roam through the 10 categories (including design, 3D, interactivity, cartoons), and check out the five finalists.

Jewels like Chris Titchborne's Tommy Grimbald or couch potato cautionary tale Horsehair can be found lower down the listings, with a bit of digging. We liked the Least Popular Films chart option, with its very British appeal for lovers of lame-dog cinema. hahabonk Holy arse-kicking ecclesiasticals!

      "body": "<p> Feats of memory are badges of a musician's professionalism, yet seeing the Zehetmair Quartet play a whole programme from memory - a challenge hardly ever attempted by most string quartets - was a uniquely compelling experience. Even more astounding was the range of music in that programme. Haydn's C Major Quartet, Op 74 No 1, and Schumann's Second, F Major Quartet, surrounded a performance of Karl Amadeus Hartmann's Second String Quartet, a piece rarely heard in this country. </p> <p>The benefits of the Zehetmairs' combined memory were immediately apparent. Each player knew the intricacies of the other three parts. In the Haydn quartet, Thomas Zehetmair - leader and founder of the ensemble, as well as a renowned soloist - engaged in a continuous dialogue of gestures with his colleagues. The result was a performance of extraordinary poetic range. The minuet was a masterpiece of artful rusticity, whilst the unadulterated round-dance of the finale exploded with thrilling, violent abandon. </p> <p>The performance of Schumann's F Major Quartet was also searingly imaginative. But their account of the Hartmann quartet was still more astonishing. Written just after the second world war, Hartmann's work is an unrelenting lament. Throughout the three movements, Hartmann finds an expressive language between the rigour of serialism and the disengagement of neo-classicism.

      "bodyText": "Feats of memory are badges of a musician's professionalism, yet seeing the Zehetmair Quartet play a whole programme from memory - a challenge hardly ever attempted by most string quartets - was a uniquely compelling experience. Even more astounding was the range of music in that programme. Haydn's C Major Quartet, Op 74 No 1, and Schumann's Second, F Major Quartet, surrounded a performance of Karl Amadeus Hartmann's Second String Quartet, a piece rarely heard in this country. The benefits of the Zehetmairs' combined memory were immediately apparent. Each player knew the intricacies of the other three parts. In the Haydn quartet, Thomas Zehetmair - leader and founder of the ensemble, as well as a renowned soloist - engaged in a continuous dialogue of gestures with his colleagues. The result was a performance of extraordinary poetic range. The minuet was a masterpiece of artful rusticity, whilst the unadulterated round-dance of the finale exploded with thrilling, violent abandon. The performance of Schumann's F Major Quartet was also searingly imaginative. But their account of the Hartmann quartet was still more astonishing. Written just after the second world war, Hartmann's work is an unrelenting lament. Throughout the three movements, Hartmann finds an expressive language between the rigour of serialism and the disengagement of neo-classicism. But at the same time as creating a fascinating stylistic synthesis, Hartmann's quartet makes a profoundly personal statement. At the end of the slow movement, in the wake of a cataclysmic climax, the music's final gesture is a barely audible major chord. In the context of the Zehetmairs' performance, this moment was a vision of an untroubled past, a state of bliss impossible to attain in the post-1945 world. But when the frantic energy of the last movement also finished with a major chord, this time forceful, the effect was different. Here, the gesture seemed hollow . For the Zehetmair Quartet to achieve the symbiotic musicality they displayed in the classical and romantic repertoires was remarkable in itself. But to manage the same intimate rapport in the complex music of Hartmann was miraculous.",

Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. *Note: in a draw where the scores finish level , the side batting in the fourth innings earn 6 points their opponents 4, plus bonus points.

Gloucestershire, meanwhile, arrived here trailing three consecutive wins and yet another one-day pot.

Only the last two, however, cast aside the shackles imposed by tight bowling and the visitors' omnipresent spring-heeled fielding. One stop by Tim Hancock was the handiwork of a habitual blood donor. </p> <p>While Ball spun an off-break lavishly to defeat Sales, Tom Cotterell, his southpaw partner, tickled the more aesthetic fancy. </p> <p>Setting off with a Tufnellesque hop, the youngster made one dip deliciously to bowl Jeff Cook, meagre reward for an auspicious stint.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world has turned cartwheels since these sides met at Cheltenham in mid-July. At that juncture they were propping up the Second Division, seemingly as plausible a pair of candidates for promotion as a couple of cops caught stealing Kojak's lollipops. Northamptonshire won that match to move off the bottom and have coasted home in their last four outings, opening up a 14-point lead at the top, equivalent to half a dozen furlongs. Gloucestershire, meanwhile, arrived here trailing three consecutive wins and yet another one-day pot. In a perverse twist, though, they forsook the nous of Mike Smith for the novel reason that he might leave footmarks that could be exploited by the home twirlers, who themselves were ultimately reduced to the singular by Graeme Swann's injured finger. That left Mark Alleyne, already deprived of the reportedly knackered Ian Harvey, to take the new ball himself, and a presentable job he made of it. Inevitably, though, the art of deception ruled and once Martyn Ball had terminated a sturdy opening stand of 82 by those occasionally incredible hulks Matthew Hayden and Adrian Rollins, luring the captain into a top-edged sweep, a handsome crowd was captivated by county cricket at its most deceptively tranquil. The quintet who passed 40 prospered according to type: Rollins obstinate, Hayden assured, David Sales bullish, Tony Penberthy unobtrusive, Russell Warren elegant. Only the last two, however, cast aside the shackles imposed by tight bowling and the visitors' omnipresent spring-heeled fielding. One stop by Tim Hancock was the handiwork of a habitual blood donor. While Ball spun an off-break lavishly to defeat Sales, Tom Cotterell, his southpaw partner, tickled the more aesthetic fancy. Setting off with a Tufnellesque hop, the youngster made one dip deliciously to bowl Jeff Cook, meagre reward for an auspicious stint.",

In the mid-Nineties, when Alec Stewart was still allowed to open, England frequently got off to a perfect start, only to subside from 120-0 to 220 all out. Today it was an even better start, and Marcus Trescothick, after tasting failure for the first time at Headingley, confirmed himself as one of the players of the summer, with his unruffled drives and that hugely encouraging ability to push forward on off stump and stay there even when the ball leaves him. </p> <p> A hundred was there for the taking, but after playing the role of Mark Taylor for four hours, he turned into Mark Butcher, and played a half-cock nothing-shot at the legspinner. If he does that this winter, his England opening career could be as brief as that of the last lefthanded opener to share a 100 stand against West Indies at the Oval - Hugh Morris of Glamorgan. </p> <p>All series, it has been a game of two halves when England have batted: sheer attrition when Curtly and Courtney are on, sheer indulgence when they take their sweaters. This morning that pattern continued but this afternoon, like an old ball, it suddenly reversed. The first four wickets fell to the support bowlers. And Courtney Walsh bowled a bad ball (a wide, gentle half-volley outside off, which Trescothick incredulously thumped to the cover boundary). Mahendra Nagamootoo got a second stroke of beginner's luck as Nasser Hussain allowed himself to be drawn well wide of off, playing with half a bat and less than half a brain. Graham Thorpe steadied the ship as he had at Headingley, but Alec Stewart then lost his footing. Maybe that's why he doesn't normally bother moving his feet. </p> <p>It wasn't a good day for captains: Jimmy Adams's blushes were partly spared by the late clatter of wickets, but his decision to bowl was a strange one. Like a weak umpire, he seemed to be trying to correct one bad decision (in fact two - batting first twice under heavy northern skies) by making another. </p> <p>Of the captains past and present, only Mike Atherton shone. Having got his retirement plans off his chest (this time next year, he says), he played the way he used to before his back got him down: upright, classical, Boycott-like in the best sense of the word. He went forward and eased the ball through the covers; he went back and whipped the legspinner past midwicket. I only saw him play one poor shot all day, and it got him out.

It broke down in February 1996, but was renewed in July 1997 soon after Tony Blair's general election victory, and Mr Hume was key in negotiating the Good Friday agreement nine months later. Mr Hume, an ardent Europhile, was a French teacher at his former school, St Columb's college in Londonderry, before becoming involved in the civil rights movement and then in founding the SDLP in 1970. He was one of the first beneficiares of the Education Act, which allowed many Catholics access to grammar schools for the first time. He is a pragmatic nationalist, and cites his father's warning after he attended one rally as a boy. He said: \"You can't eat a flag, son.\" Mr Hume was a member of the first Northern Ireland assembly in 1973, and was elected to the European parliament in 1979. He became an MP in 1983, three years after succeeding Gerry Fitt as SDLP leader.",

      "body": "<p> The second annual set of performance profiles released by the Teacher Training Agency (30 August 2000) are designed to help prospective students select an institution at which to train, and to provide institutions with benchmarking data so that training provision can be improved. It is commendable that the TTA do not attempt to aggregate all the various data sets into as simplistic league table that purports to identify the 'best' institution. A close analysis of the data shows that there is an inherent tension between the various items being measured, and that institutions that score 'highly' on one index perform 'poorly' on another. </p> <p>This paper attempts to use the data in the Performance Profiles to examine three characteristics of the institutions that provide teacher training. Each is constructed from the raw data in the profiles, supplemented on occasion by other DfEE and TTA information. The methods used to construct each scale are describes in Appendix 1, which explains the particular weightings given, and the assumptions underlying these. </p> <p>Tables have been created separately for primary teacher provision and secondary teacher provision. The characteristics of training provision for each phase are sufficiently different to make this distinction. A minority of institutions provide training that is cross-phase (teachers for Key Stage 2 and 3). These are so few (less than 3% of the total intake of student teachers) that they have been omitted from the analysis. The analysis also excludes the provision made by the School Centred Initial Teacher Training groups (SCITTs), which are small school-based training consortia that supply just 2.7% of teachers: including the 29 SCITTs, which have an average intake of less than 25 students each, distorts the comparison between the larger providers. </p> <p><strong>Table 1: Contribution to Teacher Requirements</strong> </p> <p>Table 1 (1a Primary, 1b Secondary) attempts to quantify how well each institution is meeting the need for teachers. Three characteristics have been employed in this table, reflecting different characteristics of the teaching force that is desired. </p> <p><strong>Gender</strong>: There are insufficient male teachers in the workforce as a whole. The number of men recruited into teaching each year is declining - just 13% of primary students and 38% of secondary students in 1998. A large proportion of the men who are currently teaching are in the older cohorts of teachers, who will be approaching retirement over the next decade. The TTA have a national campaign to attract more men into teaching. The fact that teaching appears to be increasingly a predominantly female profession is possibly a contributory factor to boy's under-performance in national examinations. Institutions have been weighted by their ability to attract male recruits in 1998: thus in the Primary table, 33% of the Urban Learning Foundation's students were men, while only 4% of the Open University's recruits were men. </p> <p><strong>Ethnicity</strong>: It is widely acknowledged the ethnic minorities are under-represented in the nation's teaching force, and the TTA are also attempting to recruit more ethnic minority teachers. Institutions have been scored by their success in attracting a high proportion of ethnic minority students in their 1998 intakes. There are wide variations - ten of the 67 primary providers did not recruit any ethnic minority students, while one institution, the University of North London, recruits over 11% of all the ethnic minority primary students in England. In the Primary table, the Urban Learning Foundation actually attracts the highest proportion of ethnic minority students (63%). </p> <p><strong>Contribution to regional vacancies</strong>: Teacher vacancy rates vary substantially across the country, and it is becoming increasingly evident that teacher supply operates on a regional, or even sub-regional basis. An analysis of teachers working in several London LEAs last year suggested that 40% of all teachers were working less than 20 kilometres from the institution in which they trained. The proportion of newly-qualified teachers working close to their training institution is higher. The table therefore combines the number of teachers who qualified in 1999 from each institution with the DfEE's vacancy rates for primary teachers and secondary teachers in each Government region. Thus, for example, among secondary teacher providers, Goldsmiths College, producing 250 qualified teacher in 1999 in the London region (with a secondary vacancy rate of 1.4%) scores more than the similarly sized University of Brighton (257 secondary teachers), because the vacancy rate in the south eastern region is only 0.7%, while the University of Nottingham (245 students) in the east midlands (vacancy rate 0.3%) scores even less. </p> <p>These three factors have been equally weighted to a maximum of 100, and summed to give an overall \"Contribution to teacher needs\" index with theoretical maximum score of 300). The index thus combines the <em>percentages</em> of males and ethnic minority students recruited, with the <em>numbers</em> of teachers who qualified weighted by the regional need for teachers. London-based institutions score relatively highly, but not only because they are situated in a region with a shortage of teachers. They also tend to perform better at recruiting men and ethnic minority students. </p> <p><strong>Table 2: \"Value Added\" by each institution</strong> </p> <p>Table 2 (2a Primary, 2b Secondary) compares the entry qualifications of students accepted on course with the institution's output, in terms of the proportion of final year students who both successfully qualify as teachers and succeed in being appointed to teaching posts. The TTA are urging institutions to take more students who have 20 or more A level points on undergraduate courses, and more students with at least an upper second class degree on postgraduate courses. This table takes the proportion of such 'well-qualified' students as an intake measure, and compares it to the proportion of those in the final year of study in 1998-9 who actually become classroom teachers after completing their course. For example, among the secondary teacher providers, St Mary's College had 110 final year students, 98 of whom qualified as teachers, and 97 of these took up teaching jobs. Thus 88% of the final year were sufficiently qualified, well-motivated and good enough to secure a teaching position. On the other hand, University College Worcester had 141 final year students, of whom only 116 qualified as teachers, and only 76 of these were reported as finding positions as teachers - just 54% of the entry cohort. Yet Worcester had a high proportion of 'well-qualified entrants - just over 50% of their students had a 2.1 degree or higher, while St Mary's, with an apparently 'lower quality' intake of just 34% of their postgraduate students with a 2.1 or higher, and 13% of their undergraduates with 20 or more A level points, achieve a much better output. There is a positive correlation between entry standards and output, but this is a relatively weak relationship. </p> <p>Table 2 creates an index for both employment and entry standards, both weighted to a maximum of 100, and then imputes an \"added value\" by calculating the difference between the two scales. Thus, for example, in the secondary table, Southampton has a relatively well-qualified entry, but a poor rate of students working as teachers, and therefore the institution scores less well than Sunderland, which takes relatively more students with less good entry qualifications, but nevertheless gets more of them into work in schools. </p> <p><strong>Table 3: The OfSTED rating of quality for each institution</strong> </p> <p>Each course in each institution is rated for its quality of provision by teams of OfSTED inspectors. Each course can have up to six ratings for separate aspects of provision, on a scale of 1 to 4. Table 3 takes the most recent inspection scores for each course, and calculates an average score for all the primary courses (Table 3a) and all the secondary courses (Table 3b) for each institution. The data supplied by the TTA is the most recent published data for each course, and the figures given account for the different numbers of scores given by different inspections. The maximum score possible would be 1.00, which would indicate that every course achieved the maximum score for every aspect of its provision. The lowest possible score would be 4.00. Two institutions - Homerton College and Canterbury Christ Church - had clear runs of 1 ratings for all aspects of their primary courses, and thus get the maximum possible. Because there are generally more secondary courses at each institution, it is less likely that all courses will achieve 1 ratings on all aspects of provision: nevertheless, Oxford University scores 1.08 - three of its 5 PGCE courses got all 1 scores, and the others had a small sprinkling of 2s. </p> <p><strong>Commentary</strong> </p> <p>Comparing the three tables, the most striking aspect is their inconsistency. The relationship between the OfSTED quality ratings and the other two tables show that there is a small inverse relationship between them: institutions which OfSTED score as having a high quality of provision tend to be rather less good at providing the teachers needed (male. ethnic minority, and in the regions of greatest need) than institutions which OfSTED rates as having poorer quality. </p> <p>A similar weak inverse correlation is evident in the figures for the secondary providers, and when the figures of Table 2 (\"Value Added\") are compared to OfSTED quality ratings. </p> <p><strong>Appendix 1: The Construction of Tables 1 - 3</strong> </p> <p>All data is taken from the TTA data used to compile the Initial Teacher Training Performance Profiles 2000, with the exception of the Regional Teacher Vacancy Rates 1999 (Primary and Secondary) from the Department for Education and Employment. </p> <p>In all cases the different courses provided within one institution have been summed to give a single number for primary courses and for secondary courses. Student numbers have =been summed, rather than percentages, in all cases. </p> <p>Courses designated Key Stage 2/Key Stage 3 have been eliminated. (2.9% of the total numbers of students). </p> <p>Courses provided by SCITTs have been eliminated. (2.7% of the total). </p> <p>Table 1: Contribution to Teacher Requirements </p> <p><strong>Number of teachers qualified 1999</strong>: This is the sum of the two fields Awards UG and Awards PG, and represents all the undergraduate and postgraduate awards made that give Qualified Teacher Status in 1999 by each institution. </p> <p><strong>Contribution to Gender Equality</strong>: This is derived from the field <em>pfstMale,</em> which is the percentage of male students in the first year (1998 intake). The largest qualifying value appearing was 64%, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. </p> <p><strong>Contribution to Ethnic Equality</strong>: This is derived from the field<em> pfstEthnic, </em>which is the percentage of ethnic minority students in the first year (1998 intake). The largest qualifying value appearing was 45%, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. </p> <p><strong>Contribution to regional vacancy rates</strong>: This is based on the total number of students qualified in 1999 (see a above), factored by the Regional Teacher Vacancy Rates (using the different data available for primary and secondary vacancies) from the DfEE by Government Region, using the allocations of each institution to Government Region provided by the TTA. For those institutions deemed to be 'National' rather than belonging to a particular region, the national (England) vacancy rate has been applied. The largest qualifying value was 774.2, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. </p> <p><strong>Contribution to teacher needs</strong>: This is the sum of the three previous values: gender, ethnic and vacancy contributions. The maximum value is therefore 300. Each item has been weighted so that it has a maximum value of 100, and this is therefore based on the assumption that the three factors are of equal import. </p> <p><strong>Table 2: \"Value Added\" by each institution</strong> </p> <p><strong>No of teachers qualified</strong>: As the previous table. </p> <p><strong>Entry Standards Index</strong>: This is derived from the number of students admitted in 1998 either with 20+ A level points to undergraduate courses, or with a 2.1 degree or above to postgraduate courses (<em>fstUG20+ </em>plus<em> fstPG2_1+) </em>as a percentage of the total number of undergraduates and postgraduates admitted<em> (fstUG </em>plus <em>fstPG).</em> This was then weighted so that the maximum score was 100. </p> <p><strong>Employment as Teachers of Final Year Students Index</strong>: This is derived from the number of students reported as being employed as a teacher (<em>TeachUG</em> plus <em>TeachPG</em>) as a percentage of all the students in the final year of teacher-training courses in the institution (<em>TotalUG</em> plus <em>TotalPG</em>). This was then weighted so that the maximum score was 100. </p> <p><strong>\"Added Value\" index</strong>: This value is determined as the difference between the Entry Standards Index <em>(b)</em> and the Employment as Teachers of Final Year Students Index <em>(c).</em> The theoretical range is thus from +100.00 to -100.00. </p> <p><strong>Table 3: The OfSTED rating of quality for each institution</strong> </p> <p><strong>Average Quality</strong>: This is the average of all the quality awards made by OfSTED for each relevant course, primary and secondary. It is thus the sum of ST1, ST2, ST3. T2, T4 and S1 divided by the number of awards made (not every course had all the various categories awarded. The data omits new, ungraded courses, and those for which data was unavailable. </p> <p>Grades available are 1 ( very good) to 4 (poor quality). The highest average grade therefore available is 1.00. </p> <p><strong>The analysis of this data was carried out by Judy Evans and Linda Woodland of the Management Information Unit of the University of North London.</strong></p>",

It is commendable that the TTA do not attempt to aggregate all the various data sets into as simplistic league table that purports to identify the 'best' institution. A close analysis of the data shows that there is an inherent tension between the various items being measured, and that institutions that score 'highly' on one index perform 'poorly' on another. This paper attempts to use the data in the Performance Profiles to examine three characteristics of the institutions that provide teacher training. Each is constructed from the raw data in the profiles, supplemented on occasion by other DfEE and TTA information. The methods used to construct each scale are describes in Appendix 1, which explains the particular weightings given, and the assumptions underlying these. Tables have been created separately for primary teacher provision and secondary teacher provision. The characteristics of training provision for each phase are sufficiently different to make this distinction. A minority of institutions provide training that is cross-phase (teachers for Key Stage 2 and 3).

Table 1: Contribution to Teacher Requirements Table 1 (1a Primary, 1b Secondary) attempts to quantify how well each institution is meeting the need for teachers. Three characteristics have been employed in this table, reflecting different characteristics of the teaching force that is desired. Gender: There are insufficient male teachers in the workforce as a whole. The number of men recruited into teaching each year is declining - just 13% of primary students and 38% of secondary students in 1998. A large proportion of the men who are currently teaching are in the older cohorts of teachers, who will be approaching retirement over the next decade. The TTA have a national campaign to attract more men into teaching. The fact that teaching appears to be increasingly a predominantly female profession is possibly a contributory factor to boy's under-performance in national examinations. Institutions have been weighted by their ability to attract male recruits in 1998: thus in the Primary table, 33% of the Urban Learning Foundation's students were men, while only 4% of the Open University's recruits were men. Ethnicity: It is widely acknowledged the ethnic minorities are under-represented in the nation's teaching force, and the TTA are also attempting to recruit more ethnic minority teachers. Institutions have been scored by their success in attracting a high proportion of ethnic minority students in their 1998 intakes. There are wide variations - ten of the 67 primary providers did not recruit any ethnic minority students, while one institution, the University of North London, recruits over 11% of all the ethnic minority primary students in England. In the Primary table, the Urban Learning Foundation actually attracts the highest proportion of ethnic minority students (63%). Contribution to regional vacancies: Teacher vacancy rates vary substantially across the country, and it is becoming increasingly evident that teacher supply operates on a regional, or even sub-regional basis. An analysis of teachers working in several London LEAs last year suggested that 40% of all teachers were working less than 20 kilometres from the institution in which they trained. The proportion of newly-qualified teachers working close to their training institution is higher. The table therefore combines the number of teachers who qualified in 1999 from each institution with the DfEE's vacancy rates for primary teachers and secondary teachers in each Government region. Thus, for example, among secondary teacher providers, Goldsmiths College, producing 250 qualified teacher in 1999 in the London region (with a secondary vacancy rate of 1.4%) scores more than the similarly sized University of Brighton (257 secondary teachers), because the vacancy rate in the south eastern region is only 0.7%, while the University of Nottingham (245 students) in the east midlands (vacancy rate 0.3%) scores even less. These three factors have been equally weighted to a maximum of 100, and summed to give an overall \"Contribution to teacher needs\" index with theoretical maximum score of 300). The index thus combines the percentages of males and ethnic minority students recruited, with the numbers of teachers who qualified weighted by the regional need for teachers. London-based institutions score relatively highly, but not only because they are situated in a region with a shortage of teachers. They also tend to perform better at recruiting men and ethnic minority students. Table 2: \"Value Added\" by each institution Table 2 (2a Primary, 2b Secondary) compares the entry qualifications of students accepted on course with the institution's output, in terms of the proportion of final year students who both successfully qualify as teachers and succeed in being appointed to teaching posts. The TTA are urging institutions to take more students who have 20 or more A level points on undergraduate courses, and more students with at least an upper second class degree on postgraduate courses. This table takes the proportion of such 'well-qualified' students as an intake measure, and compares it to the proportion of those in the final year of study in 1998-9 who actually become classroom teachers after completing their course. For example, among the secondary teacher providers, St Mary's College had 110 final year students, 98 of whom qualified as teachers, and 97 of these took up teaching jobs. Thus 88% of the final year were sufficiently qualified, well-motivated and good enough to secure a teaching position. On the other hand, University College Worcester had 141 final year students, of whom only 116 qualified as teachers, and only 76 of these were reported as finding positions as teachers - just 54% of the entry cohort. Yet Worcester had a high proportion of 'well-qualified entrants - just over 50% of their students had a 2.1 degree or higher, while St Mary's, with an apparently 'lower quality' intake of just 34% of their postgraduate students with a 2.1 or higher, and 13% of their undergraduates with 20 or more A level points, achieve a much better output. There is a positive correlation between entry standards and output, but this is a relatively weak relationship. Table 2 creates an index for both employment and entry standards, both weighted to a maximum of 100, and then imputes an \"added value\" by calculating the difference between the two scales. Thus, for example, in the secondary table, Southampton has a relatively well-qualified entry, but a poor rate of students working as teachers, and therefore the institution scores less well than Sunderland, which takes relatively more students with less good entry qualifications, but nevertheless gets more of them into work in schools. Table 3: The OfSTED rating of quality for each institution Each course in each institution is rated for its quality of provision by teams of OfSTED inspectors. Each course can have up to six ratings for separate aspects of provision, on a scale of 1 to 4. Table 3 takes the most recent inspection scores for each course, and calculates an average score for all the primary courses (Table 3a) and all the secondary courses (Table 3b) for each institution. The data supplied by the TTA is the most recent published data for each course, and the figures given account for the different numbers of scores given by different inspections. The maximum score possible would be 1.00, which would indicate that every course achieved the maximum score for every aspect of its provision. The lowest possible score would be 4.00. Two institutions - Homerton College and Canterbury Christ Church - had clear runs of 1 ratings for all aspects of their primary courses, and thus get the maximum possible. Because there are generally more secondary courses at each institution, it is less likely that all courses will achieve 1 ratings on all aspects of provision: nevertheless, Oxford University scores 1.08 - three of its 5 PGCE courses got all 1 scores, and the others had a small sprinkling of 2s. Commentary Comparing the three tables, the most striking aspect is their inconsistency. The relationship between the OfSTED quality ratings and the other two tables show that there is a small inverse relationship between them: institutions which OfSTED score as having a high quality of provision tend to be rather less good at providing the teachers needed (male. ethnic minority, and in the regions of greatest need) than institutions which OfSTED rates as having poorer quality. A similar weak inverse correlation is evident in the figures for the secondary providers, and when the figures of Table 2 (\"Value Added\") are compared to OfSTED quality ratings. Appendix 1: The Construction of Tables 1 - 3 All data is taken from the TTA data used to compile the Initial Teacher Training Performance Profiles 2000, with the exception of the Regional Teacher Vacancy Rates 1999 (Primary and Secondary) from the Department for Education and Employment. In all cases the different courses provided within one institution have been summed to give a single number for primary courses and for secondary courses. Student numbers have =been summed, rather than percentages, in all cases. Courses designated Key Stage 2/Key Stage 3 have been eliminated. (2.9% of the total numbers of students). Courses provided by SCITTs have been eliminated. (2.7% of the total). Table 1: Contribution to Teacher Requirements Number of teachers qualified 1999: This is the sum of the two fields Awards UG and Awards PG, and represents all the undergraduate and postgraduate awards made that give Qualified Teacher Status in 1999 by each institution. Contribution to Gender Equality: This is derived from the field pfstMale, which is the percentage of male students in the first year (1998 intake). The largest qualifying value appearing was 64%, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. Contribution to Ethnic Equality: This is derived from the field pfstEthnic, which is the percentage of ethnic minority students in the first year (1998 intake). The largest qualifying value appearing was 45%, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. Contribution to regional vacancy rates: This is based on the total number of students qualified in 1999 (see a above), factored by the Regional Teacher Vacancy Rates (using the different data available for primary and secondary vacancies) from the DfEE by Government Region, using the allocations of each institution to Government Region provided by the TTA. For those institutions deemed to be 'National' rather than belonging to a particular region, the national (England) vacancy rate has been applied. The largest qualifying value was 774.2, and all figures have been adjusted so that the maximum value is 100. Contribution to teacher needs: This is the sum of the three previous values: gender, ethnic and vacancy contributions. The maximum value is therefore 300. Each item has been weighted so that it has a maximum value of 100, and this is therefore based on the assumption that the three factors are of equal import. Table 2: \"Value Added\" by each institution No of teachers qualified: As the previous table. Entry Standards Index: This is derived from the number of students admitted in 1998 either with 20+ A level points to undergraduate courses, or with a 2.1 degree or above to postgraduate courses (fstUG20+ plus fstPG2_1+) as a percentage of the total number of undergraduates and postgraduates admitted (fstUG plus fstPG). This was then weighted so that the maximum score was 100. Employment as Teachers of Final Year Students Index: This is derived from the number of students reported as being employed as a teacher (TeachUG plus TeachPG) as a percentage of all the students in the final year of teacher-training courses in the institution (TotalUG plus TotalPG). This was then weighted so that the maximum score was 100. \"Added Value\" index: This value is determined as the difference between the Entry Standards Index (b) and the Employment as Teachers of Final Year Students Index (c). The theoretical range is thus from +100.00 to -100.00. Table 3: The OfSTED rating of quality for each institution Average Quality: This is the average of all the quality awards made by OfSTED for each relevant course, primary and secondary. It is thus the sum of ST1, ST2, ST3. T2, T4 and S1 divided by the number of awards made (not every course had all the various categories awarded. The data omits new, ungraded courses, and those for which data was unavailable. Grades available are 1 ( very good) to 4 (poor quality). The highest average grade therefore available is 1.00. The analysis of this data was carried out by Judy Evans and Linda Woodland of the Management Information Unit of the University of North London.",

      "bodyText": "Fifa president Sepp Blatter has agreed to scrap transfer fees for players over 24 in order to appease the European Commission and avoid a \"guillotine decision which could destroy the sport\". But today's decision - made by a task force of football's governing bodies and clubs - will still mean an end to football as we know it. Players will be free to hop from one club to another for greater and greater salaries and there will be little anyone can do about it. Why will any club pay \u00a340m for Luis Figo when they can get him for free? In an effort to put some breaks on their decision, the task force have suggested there should be a minimum one-year stay with a club - but it's still uncertain whether the European Commission will accept this. They also agreed to forbid the international transfer of players under the age of 18 and to pay a compensation package for the movement of players under the age of 24. Ever since the 1995 Bosman ruling - which allows free movement of out-of-contract players within Europe - Fifa and Uefa have been trying to persuade the EU that football is a special case. They have argued that the EU's efforts to bring football into line with regular employment laws will damage the sport, choking smaller clubs which can no longer rely on transfer fees. But the EU have consistently argued that sportsmen and women should be treated the same as those involved in other occupations - and their executive commission has told Fifa and Uefa to come up with an alternative to the existing transfer system. Talks, which started in February 1999 between the EU, Fifa and Uefa, have remained in deadlock. But after today's announcement it finally looks that - in line with employees in other professions - players will be able to leave their clubs without clubs being able to demand a transfer fee. In effect, the European Union have won.",

If Asian and black people, who make up 5.5% of the population, were fairly represented that figure should have been at least 22.</p> <p>An increase of just one will anger black party activists who fear the issue could cost Labour votes at the next election by exacerbating disillusionment among ethnic minority voters who, traditionally, overwhelmingly vote Labour.</p> <p>It is also embarrassing because Labour has ordered that police forces should employ the same proportion of ethnic minority officers as live in the communities they serve - a target it looks certain to fail to meet for its own parliamentary candidates.</p> <p>Party bosses are so worried that in July they held a Downing Street crisis meeting to discuss the problem. A member of Mr Blair's personal staff was present, as well as the Labour general secretary Margaret McDonagh.</p> <p>The one new winnable seat to pick an ethnic minority candidate is Gloucester - with a Labour majority of 8,259 - where Parmjit Dhanda could become the party's tenth Asian or black MP.</p> <p>Asians have been selected for no-hope seats in Wycombe, which has a Tory majority of 2,370, and Wokingham, held by the Conservative John Redwood with a majority of more than 9,000.</p> <p>The Labour party declined to say how many of the seats it won in 1997 had yet to be decided saying it would \"not give a running commentary\" on its selection process. A spokesman agreed that between 20 and 40 Labour-held seats still were vacant.</p> <p>NEC member-elect Shahid Malik said: \"Doubtless we are light years ahead of the other parties, but it will be extremely disturbing if it transpires that there's only one extra ethnic minority candidate in a winnable seat.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has so far selected just one extra candidate from the Asian or black communities to fight a winnable seat at the next general election, the Guardian has learned. With few of the 418 seats the party won in 1997 still to have their candidates decided, leading Asian and black figures in the party are furious that so little has been done to reduce under-representation of ethnic minority MPs within the Labour ranks. The revelation will embarrass party chiefs and the prime minister, Tony Blair, who has urged black people to get involved with politics, amid growing evidence that they are being turned off. Labour had nine ethnic minority MPs elected in its 1997 landslide. If Asian and black people, who make up 5.5% of the population, were fairly represented that figure should have been at least 22. An increase of just one will anger black party activists who fear the issue could cost Labour votes at the next election by exacerbating disillusionment among ethnic minority voters who, traditionally, overwhelmingly vote Labour. It is also embarrassing because Labour has ordered that police forces should employ the same proportion of ethnic minority officers as live in the communities they serve - a target it looks certain to fail to meet for its own parliamentary candidates. Party bosses are so worried that in July they held a Downing Street crisis meeting to discuss the problem. A member of Mr Blair's personal staff was present, as well as the Labour general secretary Margaret McDonagh. The one new winnable seat to pick an ethnic minority candidate is Gloucester - with a Labour majority of 8,259 - where Parmjit Dhanda could become the party's tenth Asian or black MP. Asians have been selected for no-hope seats in Wycombe, which has a Tory majority of 2,370, and Wokingham, held by the Conservative John Redwood with a majority of more than 9,000. The Labour party declined to say how many of the seats it won in 1997 had yet to be decided saying it would \"not give a running commentary\" on its selection process. A spokesman agreed that between 20 and 40 Labour-held seats still were vacant. NEC member-elect Shahid Malik said: \"Doubtless we are light years ahead of the other parties, but it will be extremely disturbing if it transpires that there's only one extra ethnic minority candidate in a winnable seat. We'd be in danger of our credibility on race being called into question in a big way. People will perceive that not enough has happened. We should have 28 MPs, we have nine. \"There is a great concern for the medium to long term. We have the first generation who traditionally voted Labour. The next generation and those after won't vote for anyone unless they believe they are representative.\" Simon Woolley of Operation Black Vote said academic research which it commissioned showed that the biggest reason that black people are turned off politics is because they are under-represented in parliament. \"When you bear in mind that 80% of ethnic minority voters vote Labour, its appalling. It's basically saying one thing and doing another.\" \"Tony Blair talks about wanting to see a black prime minister, yet election after election the Blair administration has made no inroads into turning that around.

Mr Blair told a conference of black church leaders in July of his desire for more black MPs: \"I say to young black people: 'you perhaps more than anyone can gain from going into politics.' Politics needs people from the ethnic minorities.\" The Tories, currently an all-white parliamentary party, have one ethnic minority candidate in a winnable seat - Shailesh Vara, in Northampton South, who has a Labour majority of 744 to overturn.

So no \"I think I'll wear my dad's old suit, no one will notice.\" They will, and it could mean the difference between acceptance and rejection. Women's suits are definitely out, unless you can say you have just come out of a meeting with your VC. The easiest thing to do is ditch the suit jacket. Head-to-toe Carhartt is receiving a bit of a backlash courtesy of Tvgohome.com, so opt for Duffer and Erl and Joseph jeans instead. Palm Pilots/PDAs and WAP phones are the ultimate fashion accessories, although be careful about flashing them around all night - five minutes every hour should do the trick. What to say A good starting point is: \"I've just got third-round funding\", \"Lastminute.com is shite\", \"The next big thing is P2P [person to person] or G2C [government to citizen]\", or \"I'm setting up a corner shop.\" What not to say \"I've just got third-round funding\" \"Who's Tim Berners Lee?\", \"PDAs are a waste of time\" \"Wap is amazing\" \"Is Esther Dyson the person behind those clever vacuum cleaners?\" \"Can I sleep with you?\" \"What's ADSL?\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Janine Gibson:</strong> So who would you evict from the Big Brother house?</p> <p><strong>Greg Dyke:</strong> I've been away for most of it. I haven't seen enough to make a judgement. What are the figures like?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> (I tell him analysts expect the show will take Channel 4's audience share for the year to more than 11% of total viewing.)</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Look at what it did in the Netherlands - it went through the roof. </p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> I don't understand why Channel 4 will not be doing a second series.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> I quite admire that. I think one of the greatest problems with television [is that, for example,] the first docusoap was brilliant, the one about the driving school was absolutely brilliant - the 32nd one wasn't. Changing Rooms, the makeover show, was brilliant. Ground Force is brilliant, but I'm afraid the 20th show isn't. One of the great dangers with television is that it milks everything. It eats material.</p> <p>When I was at ITV, the BBC and ITV - mainly ITV - destroyed snooker single-handedly. Because snooker had taken off suddenly and ITV had five tournaments a year -- the BBC had four -- no one knew what was what. We just killed it. Television has got a terrible tendency to take a good idea and milk it, until, in the end, everyone thinks it's dumbed down.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> I think Castaway will suffer from the hype surrounding Big Brother.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> What Big Brother's shown, which is what we know from Who Wants to be A Millionaire?, is that if you can run things consistently over a period of time, day in and day out, they work.</p> <p>&lt;B: It'll be interesting to see if it works for the People Versus, which is a very average show. </p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> The People Versus looks too much like Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. But then, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? was just Mastermind with money.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Tell me about BBC3 and BBC4.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> No, I can't, because that's what I'm going to talk about [in the MacTaggart].</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> All right. Are you concerned about the highbrow elite's reaction to the remaking of BBC1 as a drama and entertainment channel?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> That reaction is based on a false premise, so I'm not concerned at all.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Why have people got the wrong idea?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Because they always do. What happens is something gets out there as an idea; then it gets into the cuttings as something real; then everyone thinks it's happened. That was never intended.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> But you quite like to float ideas?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> I don't float them publicly - they become public. Everything becomes public knowledge out of here. But if you want to have an open, interesting environment, the cost of this is that stuff gets out and gets picked up. It's a price worth paying because you want that sort of environment. </p> <p>Did you read Mark Thompson's speech? He didn't say that. No one's been briefed. Thompson made one speech, and that was it.</p> <p>The idea that BBC1 is not going to have factual programmes or news and current affairs is simply not true.</p> <p>But what is an interesting idea... [breaks off]</p> <p>The problem is that the detractors are always there, and always will be. Some of my MacTaggart [speech] is about that. They're detractors of any change. </p> <p>There are times in the history of the BBC when you have to change the organisation. This is one of them. I say change the organisation, but it's really about changing the output. And it's one of those times because of what's happening in the digital world. </p> <p>What you need to do - and this is what I keep banging home and shall be banging home again in the MacTaggart - is say, look, if this government wants digital switch off at some point this decade - which is what it says it wants and what I suspect it will get - at some stage every home will be a multi-channel home. </p> <p>That doesn't mean they'll all be pay-TV homes, because there's quite a lot of evidence that 30-40% of them are never going to pay - and they won't pay.</p> <p>But every home will be a digital home, and at that stage the BBC will have a number of channels in every home. Therefore, you have to ask: between now and then, what type of channel portfolio will you need?</p> <p> The trouble is it's a Catch 22. You'd quite like to have that [portfolio] now. The difficulty is a large part of the population will not go digital until they have to, and they will have just a four or five channel environment. You can't afford that - they pay their licence fee and deserve to have the best of the BBC - you can't deny them that.</p> <p>But at some stage in the future you've got to say that everyone's going to be digital. And that's what Thompson was trying to say: it's a journey between now and there.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Is there a danger that the BBC's pace of change will outpace the population's move to digital? </p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> No, I think if anything... No I don't. The audience would tell you.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> What about the investments in digital radio which [BBC chairman] Sir Christopher Bland recently admitted were too far ahead of the expansion of digital radio in the UK?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Oh digital radio... but that's small money for the BBC. As I understand it there's been a problem with the set manufacturers. Did we go too far? Well there is an argument that we went too late into 24-hour news and should've gone earlier</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Come off it.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Look. Change at the BBC means criticism. Always. I've read it all. I've read a lot of it in the last few weeks. Change always means criticism. It's very very different from a commercial organisation because of that.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> But most of your changes so far have been lauded and applauded. It's only when you started talking about changing BBC1...</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Yeah but everything else is irrelevant. Right? Everything else is about finding money, trying to get a better... you know. In the end what is television about? What is radio about? It's about a combination of money and talent. Right? You're not going to get talent to work here if they don't like the place, if they think it's vicious or unpleasant or bureaucratic or all the rest of it, so you've got to change that. Secondly you've got to find money, which means to find out 24% of the money in this place is being spent running the place is just not acceptable, right? </p> <p>Those two - the combination of money and talent - in the end is what matters is what goes out on screen or on radio; what we listen to, what we use. The rest is just organisational stuff.</p> <p>So I mean, you know, easy isn't it? I come in and say I believe in programmes and I'm going to give you more money and they're gonna love you aren't they? They're going to love you for saying that. That's the easy stuff, I believe in heaven and I don't believe in hell. </p> <p>The real question is once you've got the money available, can we get the talent? Can we free up that talent and make this an exciting place to work for creative people? Cos if we can't we're dead.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> You've said several times that the important thing about work is that it should be fun </p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> (Nods...)]</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Do you think this is a fun place to work at the moment?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> For me?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> No, not for you. For everyone else. If it's not fun for you, you can go.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> They can go. That's what I said on day one. \"If you don't like it here, go somewhere else.\" People get trapped into places that they don't need to be trapped in. This is an industry that's booming.</p> <p>One person that left came to me and said: \"I wanna thank you for...\" [stops] I've got to be careful what I say... </p> <p>They described their last couple of years and they had been very unhappy. And I just said, \"well why didn't you leave?\" And they said, \"do you know I never thought about that\". Now they've got another job and came in and said thanks. </p> <p>That seems to me to be fine. You know... If you're unhappy, my view of the world is that you change it. You. The world isn't going to change it for you. You change it. Do something else. That's not to say, \"If you don't like the way I'm doing it.\" </p> <p>We're all free spirits, all free individuals...</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> You still have the responsibility to make the culture of your corporation happy...</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong>...sure you've got to make it happy. It's supposed to be fun.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Do you think they're having fun though?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> (Big sigh.) It depends where you are. I mean, no. Being here in an organisation where a lot of people are being made redundant if they're around you is not nice. It's very unpleasant.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> It's quite a prolonged revolution.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> I hate doing it. All I can say is we treat people very fairly and they happen to be lucky that they're moving out into a labour market at the moment in this industry which is booming.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> How many people have actually been sacked?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Dunno.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong>: Roughly?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Some people saw the writing on the wall and went away. We expect to save 1,200 jobs. They won't all be fired. There are areas where we got rid of 40% of the staff and we're having to recruit people because we haven't got rid of them, they just left.</p> <p>I don't like doing it. I didn't come here to do it. But at the end of the day the obligation upon us must be to put as much of the money on to the screen as we can.</p> <p>Oddly that might end up as we could well end up employing another 1,000 people, but we're shifting the money from support systems to production systems and production.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Have you sacked anyone yourself?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> (Pause.) Yeah.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Not in the past, here at the BBC?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Yeah. Well not sacked, I don't say sacked. But yes.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> What do you say to them?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Ha. Err, what I say to them is what I say to everyone - it is not your fault. It is not their fault. The world changes and organisations change. There is not a lot you can do about it. You either change with it or you lose anyway. </p> <p>Treat them properly and treat them fairly. There is always a danger that the moment someone's going, you see them as the other side. There's a real danger of that and you've got to treat people properly. I hope we're doing that, but no doubt there will be places where people don't feel that. We're certainly very generous and should be, as it's not their fault.</p> <p>And actually there was too much money in this place being spent on running the organisation.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> But then in organisations like the BBC you get the verucca effect... That people who have worked here for a long time restructure and rebuild their departments as they were before, so suddenly all your suits spring up again. </p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> All organisations do that. All organisations in the end, if you're not taking out overhead you're putting it on. There is no in-between. And you can't constantly take out overhead because it's too damaging. </p> <p>So inevitably you have a period where you take out overhead and it builds up and you take it out again and that's why people change systems and structures every five years.</p> <p>Secondly there's no ideal structure of an organisation.</p> <p>When I left Pearson it was time to change the structure, but I'd set it up and I didn't have the appetite for doing it.</p> <p>We have introduced this statistic. This figure. [Dyke has announced that the BBC currently spends 76% of its income on programmes and 24% on running the organisation and he aims to cut those costs to 15%]</p> <p>I can understand having worked here why the bureaucracy can become too big. I suspect it's the same in any public sector organisation.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Because when you sit in a profit and loss company and you think of a way of saving \u00a31m you put it on to your profit and that profit goes up by 15%, it's probably worth about \u00a320m in value to your company.</p> <p>If you sit in the BBC where all you do is spend money, you spend \u00a32.2bn a year so \u00a31m is (snaps fingers).</p> <p>The stuff we've done, like the croissants (which was really about me putting on too much weight) or the flowers. If people want flowers on their desks then they can pay for them. I don't see why the licence fee payer should pay for them. The transport: we've put a ban on booking cars. You're not allowed to have more than 15 minutes waiting time and we've put on a bus service between the bits of the BBC. [He doesn't take it, cos of the getting in a lift syndrome where people wander round saying: \"Oh yes, the DG approved it.\"]</p> <p>Those things are about saying, look we don't waste money. In some ways it's easier in a profit and loss company.</p> <p>Here, we say, we're going to spend the money on programmes.</p> <p>The first day, I got in my car and there were piles that thick [waves arms in the air] and they said that's your reading for tomorrow and I said: \"You must be mad. I'm not reading all that.\" Once people began to understand I wasn't going to read it they cut it short.</p> <p>I always carried all my paper around in boxes. Once I lost one... and it didn't seem to make any difference.</p> <p>What I do is have about ten ideas going. That's what I'm interested in.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> It's like an oven in here...</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Don't get me going. The Chinese minister for culture came here and he said: \"Mr Dyke, it is very warm in here. Could you turn down the heating?\" I said: \"Minister there are some things I can do about the BBC and some I can't. One thing I can't do is change the air conditioning.\"</p> <p><strong>JG::</strong> Are people finding it weird to adapt?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> I don't do details. I think one of the dangers is that there was almost a culture here of having written the paper, that was the end of it. A report culture. Now I'm not interested in papers, I'm interested in what we do.</p> <p>Do you know what I mean?</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Oh yes. I vividly recall Extending Choice - the BBC's role in the digital age.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Yeah. My view is: look, the paper's irrelevant. What are we going to do? What are we going to change?</p> <p>So yeah, it was difficult. One of the things of course, which John Birt warned me about, is that you're going ahead, getting things sorted and out of nowhere comes the Queen Mother's pageant that you've never heard of, you've no idea what it's about and suddenly it dominates a week or 10 days. You realise you have to have a system which gives you some time to sort those.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Was that a low point?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> No. No.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> What was?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> The stuff about my shares [Dyke was accused by a number of newspapers - led by the Times - of conflict of interest because he owned shares in companies including Granada at the time that he joined the BBC as director-general designate] was a low point because it was deeply unfair.</p> <p> I was doing precisely what the BBC had asked me to do. I didn't even negotiate a contract. When I got the job I just signed what they wanted.</p> <p>The suggestion that somehow you were corrupt for taking the job when in all honesty no one, well certainly not me, would take it for the money. I've got enough money. I don't need the money.</p> <p>And suddenly you realise you're in a much much more political world. That's it. You're closer to the world of politics than you are to the world of business and I don't like that a lot. I chose many years ago not to be a politician. They're the bits I don't like.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> But you're familiar with it....</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Oh, I'm familiar with it, but I still find being slagged off by some second rate backbench MP a pain in the arse. But that's part of the game.</p> <p>But a lot of it isn't. I just find sitting in the middle of a political battle, which you end up doing a lot in this job, I don't like it a lot. It's not what I want to do with my life. The upside is it's a fascinating place. You've got an enormous amount of output.</p> <p>The political stuff is that I can sit here and tell them what to do. You must be joking. In the middle of the premier league negotiations Panorama was doing a documentary about it. I asked them why they were doing it and they said, \"We're doing it to test you\". </p> <p>I said: \"It better be bloody good. If we lose the contract because of it and it's rubbish, I shall be really annoyed.\"</p> <p>I'm fair game. My kids aren't. My kids are entitled... and suddenly you find their shares are being investigated...</p> <p>I'm not really that sort of person. I don't have many low points. I'm quite a resilient human being. My view of the world is that everything will work out.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> How much of the BBC's output do you watch?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> Not enough. Can't watch it enough. Not enough of the competition either. What do I think of the output? I watched the night before last the re-run of the BBC2 documentary about the expedition to find out what happened to Mallory. Fantastic.</p> <p>I think the problem with television is that it eats material so I think the output's mixed. Some of it's good, some of it's not, but you've got to get the average better.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Do you think any of the networks are at the top of their game at present?</p> <p>I think the radio stations are pretty good at the moment. I'm really a Radio 4, Radio 5 listener. When I got here I thought I'd better listen to some of the other. I thought of Radio 2 as what my Auntie Vera used to listen to - not for my generation, but it's great. [Radio 2 controller] Jim Moir's done a really good job there. </p> <p>I'm doing a tour of regional radio stations. In 1965 one local newspaper had to buy its own typewriter. It's the same now in local radio. [Tells a story about being in Radio Coventry where the studio is the newsroom and everyone has to be quiet when the broadcasts are one].</p> <p>I said, \"Come on, this is not big money for the BBC.\" Local radio's been squeezed too much.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> What about BBC1?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> BBC1 has got some brilliant bits. Some of the drama is as good as anything you'll see over the years. A lot of BBC1's quite good, we just need to make more of it.</p> <p>Everybody I know who's been a programme-maker has spent a lot of money on a piece of garbage, but there are very few people who have made wonderful things with very little money. Resources and talent. Resources and talent.</p> <p>BBC2 is still erm [pauses] not sure what it is. It never has done. Is it the channel of the Open University - or is it the home of Gimme Gimme Gimme?</p> <p>It's got some great programmes on it. Some great programmes. You know what Channel 4 is, by and large.</p> <p>But if you judge a channel by some of the bits, then some of the bits are great.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Your 17-strong executive committee is quite sizeable. Are they collaborative or do they still gang up on each other?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> I don't see it, but I suspect there still is [ganging up]... My style is that you don't take people aside afterwards and say: \"You shouldn't have said that,\" you say what you think.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Programme Review [a torturous meeting where BBC executives discuss each other's programmes] is traditionally full of backbiting isn't it? I've heard it described as a complete carve up.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> That's always been like that. When I first got a job in TV at LWT I went to my first reviewing meeting and about four people completely slagged off this poor bloke's programme. He waited for weeks until it was one of theirs' and wreaked his revenge.</p> <p>If you completely screw up, what you want is a discussion with the people in the room saying look guys, we've completely screwed this, let's fix it. There's no point having people scoring points. What's the point? Might as well go into politics.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> People have behaved like politicians in the BBC over the last ten years, you know they have.</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> As I get older I find politics harder and harder to understand. If you've got a problem, you want to sit people round a table and say how do we solve this?</p> <p>I had lunch with a senior opposition minister early on who said to me, \"if you really want to change the BBC, keep as far away from Westminster as you can.\" I think there's some truth in that. It's not the role of the broadcaster to be in government's pockets.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> What do you think the main differences between your BBC and John Birt's BBC will prove to be? </p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> John [Birt] and I believed in very similar things, I just think we have a very different style of management.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> So does that mean that your BBC will be similar to his?</p> <p><strong>GD:</strong> No. [pauses]. Because I think... I think... if you want organisations to change you have to carry the staff with you. If you can't carry the staff with you, you can't change it.</p> <p>I did a thing for the NHS a few years ago [He chaired a panel writing a report for the government] which had some quite good ideas in it that were largely ignored. </p> <p>One of the things it said was: \"If you can't get the staff back onside, they've had political initiative overload, and they're not going to take nay notice.\" </p> <p>[As part of the exercise] I wanted to be a porter for a night. So I went to the Whittington in North London to A&amp;E on a Friday in an overall and a hat. Someone came in who I knew. Said to me: \"Is there any way you can hurry this up?\" I just said: \"Naah, I can't help you.\"</p> <p>It was an amazing night. A kid was born in the car park, a bloke walked in and hit one of the nurses... All that kind of stuff. And the idea that I was going to go up to one of these nurses and say: \"Do you think you've met your charter standards?\" I mean, the only thing to say was: \"How do you survive this every night?\"</p> <p>The problem with the health service - and you saw a bit in the BBC - was that the people down on the coalface thought they did it despite the management and despite the organisation, not because of it. That was the biggest change you had to take at the health service and it's the same here. You had to... [trails off]</p> <p>Somehow John had lost contact, the relationship with the people who worked here. </p> <p>That's most of what I spend my time doing. </p>",

JG: (I tell him analysts expect the show will take Channel 4's audience share for the year to more than 11% of total viewing.) GD: Look at what it did in the Netherlands - it went through the roof. JG: I don't understand why Channel 4 will not be doing a second series. GD: I quite admire that. I think one of the greatest problems with television [is that, for example,] the first docusoap was brilliant, the one about the driving school was absolutely brilliant - the 32nd one wasn't. Changing Rooms, the makeover show, was brilliant. Ground Force is brilliant, but I'm afraid the 20th show isn't. One of the great dangers with television is that it milks everything. It eats material. When I was at ITV, the BBC and ITV - mainly ITV - destroyed snooker single-handedly. Because snooker had taken off suddenly and ITV had five tournaments a year -- the BBC had four -- no one knew what was what. We just killed it. Television has got a terrible tendency to take a good idea and milk it, until, in the end, everyone thinks it's dumbed down. JG: I think Castaway will suffer from the hype surrounding Big Brother. GD: What Big Brother's shown, which is what we know from Who Wants to be A Millionaire?, is that if you can run things consistently over a period of time, day in and day out, they work.",

      "body": "<p>They are fresh faced twenty-somethings who wear combat trousers to work and dream about making a fast buck while burning vast sums of someone else's venture capital. </p> <p>At least that is what we thought dot.com entrepreneurs were supposed to be. </p> <p>New research from KPMG Consulting suggests that the identikit \"e-business leader\" is actually a far more sober-suited type. Typically aged 38, he often works seven days a week, has little time for a social life and is more likely to be found travelling economy class on a budget airline than the business class of a longer established carrier. </p> <p>And nine out of 10 dot.com directors say they would wear a traditional suit to an important meeting because casual dress was \"inappropriate\". </p> <p>The report, E-Business Leaders Survey 2000, paints dot.com directors in a far more flattering light than the publicity many in cyberspace have attracted after high-profile failures by the likes of Boo.com. </p> <p>\"Most people think that dot.coms are run by young graduates, who make loads of money in a short space of time,\" said Alan Buckle, chief executive of KPMG Consulting UK. \"The dot.com leaders we surveyed work hard and are extremely dedicated - they are not kids, playing at business and hoping to make a fast buck. </p> <p>\"The research shows that there really is no short cut to success in the new economy. Just like a traditional business, a net venture will only thrive thanks to the hard work and business sense of its people. </p> <p>\"But there are critical differences in how dot.com leaders work that are increasingly likely to spread to the rest of the UK plc - particularly the focus on keeping costs to a minimum and the changing work patterns that reflect the 24/7 culture of the internet world.\" </p> <p>KPMG interviewed 101 executives and found several differences between dot.com and traditional company working patterns. The biggest gap is in the median annual company turnover of the two groups: for traditional businesses it was \u00a3860m, for internet firms just \u00a3750,000. </p> <p>Despite the gap both groups worked more than 56 hours a week on average. Directors of internet firms are twice as likely as traditional directors to work 71 hours per week and 40% are still in the office after 8pm. </p> <p>More than a third said they have little time to relax or socialise and when they do take time out to read a book almost half read business books rather than fiction. On average dot.com directors take less than half of their annual holiday entitlement. </p> <p>Internet directors are less likely to have degrees or backgrounds in finance but more have had private educations and come from marketing backgrounds. </p> <p>The average age of the two groups of directors was much closer than researchers expected. Although 10 times as many dot.com directors were under 30 than those in traditional businesses, the average age of executives at new economy firms was an older than expected 38. The average age of old economy business leaders was 46. </p> <p>What motivates each group also threw up some interesting results.

      "bodyText": "They are fresh faced twenty-somethings who wear combat trousers to work and dream about making a fast buck while burning vast sums of someone else's venture capital. At least that is what we thought dot.com entrepreneurs were supposed to be. New research from KPMG Consulting suggests that the identikit \"e-business leader\" is actually a far more sober-suited type. Typically aged 38, he often works seven days a week, has little time for a social life and is more likely to be found travelling economy class on a budget airline than the business class of a longer established carrier. And nine out of 10 dot.com directors say they would wear a traditional suit to an important meeting because casual dress was \"inappropriate\". The report, E-Business Leaders Survey 2000, paints dot.com directors in a far more flattering light than the publicity many in cyberspace have attracted after high-profile failures by the likes of Boo.com. \"Most people think that dot.coms are run by young graduates, who make loads of money in a short space of time,\" said Alan Buckle, chief executive of KPMG Consulting UK. \"The dot.com leaders we surveyed work hard and are extremely dedicated - they are not kids, playing at business and hoping to make a fast buck. \"The research shows that there really is no short cut to success in the new economy. Just like a traditional business, a net venture will only thrive thanks to the hard work and business sense of its people. \"But there are critical differences in how dot.com leaders work that are increasingly likely to spread to the rest of the UK plc - particularly the focus on keeping costs to a minimum and the changing work patterns that reflect the 24/7 culture of the internet world.\" KPMG interviewed 101 executives and found several differences between dot.com and traditional company working patterns. The biggest gap is in the median annual company turnover of the two groups: for traditional businesses it was \u00a3860m, for internet firms just \u00a3750,000. Despite the gap both groups worked more than 56 hours a week on average. Directors of internet firms are twice as likely as traditional directors to work 71 hours per week and 40% are still in the office after 8pm. More than a third said they have little time to relax or socialise and when they do take time out to read a book almost half read business books rather than fiction. On average dot.com directors take less than half of their annual holiday entitlement. Internet directors are less likely to have degrees or backgrounds in finance but more have had private educations and come from marketing backgrounds. The average age of the two groups of directors was much closer than researchers expected. Although 10 times as many dot.com directors were under 30 than those in traditional businesses, the average age of executives at new economy firms was an older than expected 38. The average age of old economy business leaders was 46. What motivates each group also threw up some interesting results. Dot.com directors cited the chance to grow a business from scratch, working in a young, dynamic environment and stock options as the three biggest motivating factors. Old economy directors say they are turned on most by stock options and high salaries. When it comes to dressing for work, 82% of dot.com executives favour permanent dress down days but nine out of 10 will put on a suit for an important business meeting. Eight out of 10 old economy bosses wear suits every day. Nearly half of all executives plan to retire by the time they are 60 but almost 15% of e-business leaders love work so much they do not plan to hang over the reigns until they are 70. The dot.com executive... Average age 38 Prefers casual clothes Twice as likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous More likely to have a private education Less likely to have a degree Background in marketing or IT Willing to take risks Works very long hours Rarely goes out Travels infrequently and flies economy Admires Richard Branson Would love an Audi TT Dreams of being a pilot Retirement age varies from 30-70 The traditional executive...

Ezesurf's managing director, Matt Bryson, announced the closure of the company in a 2,300-word statement on the company's website, and blamed a variety of people and situations for its problems. The monologue was later removed from the site. The failure of the AltaVista and Ezesurf services illustrates the difficulty many internet service providers are experiencing in moving towards the unmetered access model pioneered in the US. In Britain, home internet users have to pay local phone charges for each minute they are online. But in the US, local calls are included in a flat rate package supplied by the telecoms provider. Analysts have repeatedly said that until the UK has unmetered access internet growth and usage will be restricted.",

      "body": "<p><strong>First Tuesday</strong> <a href=\"http://www.firsttuesday.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.firsttuesday.com</a> Set up in London in October 1998, First Tuesday holds regular \"matchmaking\" events for start-ups in more than 80 cities across the globe, employing 20 staff worldwide. It claims to have helped entrepreneurs to raise more than $147m (\u00a398m) in funding.</p> <p><strong>E-women</strong> <a href=\"http://www.e-women.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.e-women.org</a> One of the many networking events to have emerged that focus solely on women, E-women is held every few months, generally with top-name speakers - the last one pulled in Patricia Hewitt MP. In general, E-women events are very studious and, while wine is served, it is rare for anyone to over indulge. They are also generally quite well-dressed affairs, with mainly key women in the industry turning out.</p> <p><strong>The Chemistry</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thechemistry.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thechemistry.com</a> This is a bit more difficult to get in to than First Tuesday, as applicants have to be invited and then vetted for suitability. Essentially, it does the same thing as First Tuesday: matching VCs with entrepreneurs and service providers. </p> <p><strong>Four Leaf</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fourleaf.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fourleaf.com</a> The Four Leaf company is dedicated to the art of networking, although this is mainly done via the website. It does not run events, despite having been involved in Netproz, but plans to launch a channel covering all industry events on Four Leaf.</p> <p><strong>WAPWednesday</strong> <a href=\"http://www.wapwednesday.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.fourleaf.com</a> As the name suggests, WAPwednesday meets on Wednesdays and involves local mobile commerce professionals getting together in different European markets to talk about, yes, you guessed it, WAP. The format is similar to a seminar-focused network event, and meetings are open to anyone with an interest in WAP and m- commerce. WAPwednesday was hatched in December 1999. </p> <p><strong>NetProZ</strong> <a href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/netproz-forum\" target=\"_NEW\">www.egroups.com/group/netproz-forum</a> In the vane of First Tuesday, NetProZ could be called \"Third Thursday\". It describes its events as \"hosted networking\", but, unlike First Tuesday, entry is free. This informal matchmaking service was conceived in May 1999 - driven by the need to put specialist media, telecoms, finance and retail commentators in touch with each other. </p> <p><strong>The Ecademy</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theecademy.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.theecademy.com/</a> Ecademy runs an e-commerce-focused event that meets once a month on Wednesday evenings. There is usually a speaker, and attendance is free. Ecademy provides networking events, as well as training, business development, examination certification, seminars, content distribution and consultancy services.</p> <p><strong>Digital People</strong> <a href=\"http://www.digitalpeople.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.digitalpeople.org</a> Digital People grew out of conference-oriented events into a smaller group that meets every month on a Wednesday. Industry speakers are the mainstay of these meetings, which include drinks and a buffet. There is a charge to get in. </p> <p><strong>Paradigm Violators</strong> <a href=\"http://www.egroups.com/group/paradigmviolators/info.html\" target=\"_NEW\">www.egroups.com/group/paradigmviolators/info.html</a> The description on the website says \"Paradigm Violators is for people who are not satisfied with the status quo.\" So if you want to meet these types of people, sign up and go along once a month. This free event offers speakers and food, and targets marketers, VCs and entrepreneurs. </p> <p><strong>The Glasshouse</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theglasshouse.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.theglasshouse.net/</a> The Glasshouse is a recently set up monthly networking party aimed at entrepreneurs, wannabe entrepreneurs and business people. Entry is free. Events, held at private clubs, are limited to around 150-200 people in order to keep them intimate. There are plans to host workshops. </p> <p><strong>Informal parties</strong></p> <p><strong>Netnight</strong> A few individuals in key new media companies set up the original networking do in early 1997. It is held much less frequently than other networking parties that have sprung up over the past few years, and sometimes only occurs every six months. Netnight is generally organised by Ralph Averbuch, business development at Yahoo UK &amp; Ireland, with sponsorship by the likes of Pixelpark, MSN, Ziff Davis and Price Jamieson. Drinks are free, but it is difficult to get tickets, the number of which are limited to 450 and only allocated to the sponsors, who send them out to business partners at their discretion. If you get a ticket, go, because everyone there is invited for a reason and the networking opportunities are good. The downside is that you feel obliged to behave yourself and do some proper networking.</p> <p><strong>NetEdNight</strong> This event was set up as an alternative to NetNight for people working on the content side of the Web - in other words, site editors and journalists, although some \"creatives\" are allowed in too. NetEdNight began life in June 1998 and takes place twice a year (usually June and October/November). Although it is sponsored, no branding is allowed at the event itself. </p> <p><strong>Netimperative</strong> Although billed as a networking event, the Netimperative monthly parties are generally a good excuse to meet people and have a drink. The bar is free, courtesy of various sponsors, and the dress code is young, trendy and labels.</p> <p><strong>Talking Frog</strong> <a href=\"http://www.talkingfrog.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.theglasshouse.net/</a> Talking Frog was the brainchild of bEurope - a business-to-business (b2b) \"generator\" set up by former Guardian Unlimited boss Justin Walters. It is aimed at technical people such as programmers and developers - in other words, the type of people who rarely venture outdoors. It is held every month. </p> <p><strong>Boobnight</strong> <a href=\"http://www.boobnight.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.boobnight.co.uk</a> This long-running event began life in November 1998 but, as the name suggests, there is no free booze (the acronym stands for \"buy our own beer\"). It is one of the better events, but has been criticised for being cliquey. It is best to go there with a few colleagues, or arrange to meet people there. The general code is to wear as little as possible, drink as much as you can, but don't try to sell anything to anyone. \"It's a purely social event. You are there to find out things other than where people work. Generally, it's great for recruitment consultants and those who need to spice up their love-life,\" says one of the head honchos. Boobnight is held on the first Thursday of each month, just after pay-day.</p> <p><strong>Clerkenwell Social</strong> <a href=\"http://www.clerkenwell@egroups.com/group/clerkenwell\" target=\"_NEW\">www.clerkenwell@egroups.com/group/clerkenwell</a> This does exactly what it says on the tin. It is a social evening for Clerkenwell new media types, entry is free and sponsors pay for the beer. Run by Sophie Sillochi at Guardian Unlimited and Moreover.com, it takes place on a monthly basis and tends to have the same kind of atmosphere as Boobnight. The Clerkenwell Social was conceived by Guardian Unlimited as the antithesis of First Tuesday. </p> <p><strong>The WAP Group</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thewapgroup.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thewapgroup.com/</a> The WAP group runs monthly meetings for developers, start-ups and anyone interested in WAP. Entry is free and there is normally a seminar, followed by a discussion. Events are tied to concurrent events in the US and Canada.</p> <p><strong>Dotcircus</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dotcircus.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dotcircus.com</a> This is a free, informal fortnightly networking group that matches VCs with entrepreneurs. </p> <p> <strong>Overseas: US</strong></p> <p>Unlike the British, Americans love to do rooftop parties - cocktails being the preferred tipple. Another key difference is that Americans do not go to parties to get drunk. Far from it, they go with strict agendas: to meet certain people and make strong business contacts. </p> <p><strong>The Industry Standard</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thestandard.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thestandard.com</a> This event began in mid-1998 in San Francisco to celebrate the first issue of the magazine. The parties became so popular that the Standard extended them to other cities (Washington, New York) and began hosting larger events in San Francisco, its main market. There are plans to bring the event to the UK, kicking off on October 18 - the night before the first issue of the Industry Standard Europe is released.</p> <p><strong>Cocktails with Courtney</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cocktailswithcourtney.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cocktailswithcourtney.com/</a> This is billed by Courtney Pulitzer (yes, her family is connected with the Pulitzer Prize) as a gathering of \"internet industry friends, associates and business acquaintances for a fine evening with witty and thought-provoking conversations, cocktails to heighten the mood and complimentary hors d'oeuvres\" - sounds lovely. Courtney has started to bring her inimitable model to this side of the pond, holding three parties so far this year. While the reception was generally fine - \"everyone loves to drink champagne all night,\" said one punter - Courtney disappointed a few attendees by failing to be the perfect hostess. \"I thought she would do a lot of introductions and 'match-making' but she didn't,\" said another punter. She should have done a quick introductory speech. The people there were a strange mixture of dot.com entrepreneurs and agency staff, all of whom seemed a bit hesitant to speak to each other and a little confused as to what the evening was all about.\" </p> <p><strong>Garage.com</strong> <a href=\"http://www.garage.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.garage.com/</a> Entrepreneur/VC match-maker Garage.com offers day-long boot-camps for start-ups. Run along the lines of conferences/ workshops, these events have received no end of critical acclaim and networking opportunities are said to be \"excellent\". Garage.com will soon start a gruelling schedule of boot-camps and networking parties in the UK. </p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>August 25 2000:</strong> Dyke used the MacTaggart Lecture, the keynote speech at the Guardian Edinburgh international television festival, to outline a future vision for the BBC based on the principle of \"universality\" - making all the corporation's publicly funded services available in all homes. He added that in the digital era the BBC's single most important role will be to make \"great British programmes\".</p> <p>He said universality meant the BBC will limit itself to seven licence fee-funded TV services on five channels - the maximum that could fit on the BBC's digital terrestrial multiplex and be available free to all digital TV viewers.</p> <p>The services, Dyke said, would include a BBC1 focused on delivering \"greater impact\", but without banishing all current affairs, documentaries, religion and arts. Dyke also announced that the BBC planned to move its 9pm news to 10pm from 2001. </p> <p>BBC2, he added, would take some shows from BBC1 and become the channel for \"intelligent specialist factual\", leisure and lifestyle, \"thoughtful analysis, creatively ambitious drama and comedy, and specialist sports\".</p> <p>But Dyke said this gradual transformation would take years, maybe until after analogue switch-off - estimated to take place towards the end of the decade. He added that BBC1 and BBC2 would continue to be aimed at analogue viewers, who are expected to make up the majority of TV homes until at least 2003.</p> <p>BBC Choice would be transformed into youth-oriented service BBC3; while BBC Knowledge was to become BBC4, \"a mixture of Radios 3 and 4 on television\". The other services would be News 24 and two children's services, aimed at pre-school and six to 13-year-olds, which will go out on BBC3 and 4 during the daytime.</p> <p>Dyke also announced that the BBC would be spending an extra \u00a3480m on programmes and services within two years - a 30% increase in real terms over three years. More than half the extra money will be spent on BBC1 and 2, with BBC3 and 4 having a combined budget of \u00a3130m and the Nations and Regions getting an extra \u00a350m.</p> <p><strong>August 7:</strong> BBC lobbying was reported to have persuaded the government not to abolish the board of governors. But the BBC governors are expected to have their powers curtailed and be made to report to a single independent regulator that will be created to oversee the broadcasting industry.</p> <p> <strong>August 6: </strong>The Sunday Times reported that Greg Dyke was planning to use his MacTaggart speech at the Edinburgh TV festival to unveil plans to reposition BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge as BBC3 and BBC4. The newspaper reported that BBC3 would be relaunched in April 2001 as a youth channel with a \u00a392m annual budget. BBC4, which is to be repositioned as a high-brow arts, science and politics channel, is expected to have a \u00a350m budget. Dyke was said to have discussed his plans with the BBC governors during their monthly meeting in July and to have described BBC4 as a \"virtual Tate Modern\".</p> <p><strong>July 13:</strong> In his first appearance before the Commons media select committee as director-general, Dyke told MPs that the BBC needed to adapt to a digital multi-channel TV environment. He said BBC1 would largely become an entertainment channel, while assuring the committee that there would always be a place for current affairs. BBC2 would carry more serious output, while BBC Choice would become youth and comedy channel BBC3. BBC Knowledge would evolve into BBC4 - an arts and culture channel. </p> <p><strong>July 12: </strong>Dyke failed in his bid to lure friend and former LWT colleague lord Melvyn Bragg to the BBC. Lord Bragg signed a lucrative four-year contract to remain LWT controller of arts and features.</p> <p><strong>July 10:</strong> It was announced that up to 1,100 BBC jobs were to go as part of Dyke's restructuring of the organisation. Most of the job losses and 70% of accompanying savings were to come from support areas - including human resources, marketing and publicity, strategy and finance - and management, with around 200 posts expected to be axed from the resources division. </p> <p>The cuts form part of measures expected to produce savings of \u00a3750m over the next six years, as the BBC strives to meet Dyke's target of increasing the proportion of licence fee revenue it spends on programming and services from 76% to 85%. </p> <p>Dyke also unveiled further details of the new BBC corporate structure he would be introducing, including four new TV genre commissioners for entertainment, drama, factual and arts programming, who would work with the channel controllers. </p> <p>Within the factual and learning production division, 10 department heads were asked to compete for three new posts: head of documentaries and investigations, leisure and factual programming and specialist factual. A new head of religion and ethics post was also created within the division. </p> <p>Factual and learning was asked to work with BBC News to create a business programming department.</p> <p>The former drama and entertainment department management teams were to be merged and streamlined within the new drama, entertainment and children's production division, under Alan Yentob, who would also oversee a new innovative unit, Fictionlab.</p> <p>BBC Radio, headed by Jenny Abramsky, was renamed Radio &amp; Music. </p> <p><strong>June 21:</strong> Dyke announced a further \u00a315m in funding for BBC1 and BBC2 - to come from efficiency savings - as the BBC unveiled its 1999-2000 annual report. In the face of criticism from the BBC governors that the average quality of BBC1 shows \"was still not good enough\", Dyke promised a \"fundamental change\" in the channel's performance. But he skirted around a question about whether BBC1 controller Peter Salmon was to blame for the channel's poor showing. </p> <p>The annual report also revealed that Dyke's predecessor, Sir John Birt, received a termination payment of \u00a3328,400 for retiring early.</p> <p><strong>June 15:</strong> The BBC won back live rights to the FA Cup final from ITV. The corporation also secured live rights to England's home football internationals, as part of a \u00a3400m three-year deal with BSkyB. </p> <p>However, Dyke was forced to back-track on accusations of skulduggery by ITV and the Premiership in the earlier deal to wrest Match of the Day football highlights away from the BBC. Match of the Day will be revived for a handful of weekends each year to cover the FA Cup.</p> <p><strong>June 14:</strong> Dyke, who arrived at the BBC promising to reverse the loss of key sports rights, suffered the biggest reversal of his tenure to date when ITV snatched Premiership highlights, effectively signalling the death-knell for Saturday night BBC1 institution Match of the Day. The BBC lost out despite doubling what it paid for the previous highlights deal - to \u00a3120m over three years. Dyke misjudged how much ITV wanted the rights; the commercial broadcaster bid \u00a3183m.</p> <p><strong>June 12:</strong> In the first public indication of a major shift in the BBC's strategic thinking, director of television Mark Thompson announced plans to move from the mixed schedules offered by BBC1 and BBC2 to genre-based channels. In a speech at the Banff TV festival in Canada, which was drafted in close consultation with Dyke, he said there would be \"no sacred cows\" in a review of how the BBC should adapt its TV output for the digital multi-channel era. Thompson added that genre-based channels would allow the BBC to extend, rather than dilute, its public service remit. </p> <p>But the speech aroused immediate fears that the BBC was planning to dumb down its TV output and turn BBC1 into an entertainment service, shifting news and serious documentaries and current affairs to BBC2. </p> <p>On the same day, it was announced that BBC director of public policy Patricia Hodgson was leaving the corporation to become Independent Television Commission chief executive. Hodgson was regarded as one of Sir John Birt's most trusted lieutenants, and her role had already been diminished under Dyke.</p> <p><strong>June 5:</strong> ITV controller of children's and youth Nigel Pickard, who worked for Dyke at TVS in the 80s, was poached to become BBC controller of children's programmes.</p> <p><strong>May 20:</strong> Grandstand, the BBC's flagship Saturday afternoon sports programme, was cancelled because of a lack of decent events to show. The 42-year-old institution, which had previously only come off air during annual holiday periods and the funeral of Diana, princess of Wales, was the victim of the BBC's loss of sports rights.</p> <p><strong>May 13:</strong> Dyke risked sparking a political row with the appointment of former Independent editor Andrew Marr as the BBC's political editor. Marr, who is regarded as left-leaning, was recruited by Dyke and head of news Tony Hall to replace Robin Oakley. Oakley, a former Times political editor with Conservative sympathies, was persuaded to retire a year early to make way for Marr.</p> <p><strong>May 10:</strong> In a further cost-cutting measure, BBC department heads received a memo from Dyke informing them that in future croissants would not be served at breakfast meetings.</p> <p><strong>May 2: </strong>A shuttle bus service was introduced to ferry staff between Broadcasting House in central London and Television Centre 'out west'. The move formed part of a Dyke-inspired clampdown on taxi costs. </p> <p><strong>April 7: </strong>Dyke pledged to increase the proportion of BBC employees from ethnic minorities to 10%, and double the number of managers from ethnic backgrounds by 2003, in a speech at the race in the media awards dinner. He said people from ethnic minorities made up 8% of the BBC workforce, but only 2% of managers. </p> <p><strong>April 3:</strong> Unveiling his strategic vision for \"One BBC\", Dyke promised to spend at least an extra \u00a3100m on programming and services in the coming year. </p> <p>He announced plans for a flatter management structure, with an 18-strong executive committee at its centre. </p> <p>Dyke also set a target of reducing the proportion of licence fee income spent on running the BBC from 24% to 15% over the next five years - in order to invest more in programming.</p> <p>He said this would free up \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and help meet the government's savings target of \u00a31.2bn over the next seven years. Dyke indicated that drama and entertainment would be top of the list for extra funding, but said neglected areas, such as local radio, would also benefit.</p> <p>Dyke said he wanted to bring programme-makers closer to the centre of decision-making - 10 out of the 18 executive committee members would be responsible for production or broadcasting, compared with four in the previous senior executive forum.</p> <p>As part of the management reorganisation, the much-maligned, Birt-inspired division between the BBC's broadcasting and production operations was abolished, along with the independent commissioning group. Four programming divisions were created: drama, entertainment &amp; children, factual and learning, sport &amp; news - along with a new media division to develop interactive TV and online operations. </p> <p>In sport, children's and education, commissioning and programme-making were reintegrated. All in-house producers were to be offered output guarantees and longer term commissions. And the BBC internal market was to be simplified, with the number of business units cut from 190 to 50.</p> <p>In radio, Abramsky was given responsibility for Radio 5 Live and music production - from the News and Production directorates, respectively.</p> <p><strong>March 8: </strong>The BBC saw off Kelvin MacKenzie's TalkSport to retain radio rights to England's home cricket Tests, in a bid orchestrated by Dyke. The BBC was said to have paid about \u00a32m for the five-year deal. </p> <p><strong>March 2: </strong>Helen Boaden was appointed Radio 4 controller, replacing James Boyle.</p> <p><strong>February 21:</strong> Chris Smith announced a BBC funding settlement that gave it a rise in licence fee income equivalent to \u00a3200m a year over the next seven years. As a result, the licence fee for 2000-2001 would rise by 1.5% above inflation from April 1 - to \u00a3104.</p> <p>While offering the BBC more money, Smith neatly side-stepped the \u00a324 digital licence fee proposed by the Davies committee, which had been so roundly condemned by commercial rivals as a \"digital poll tax\". </p> <p>But the increase he offered was well below the extra \u00a33bn the BBC had asked for to see it through to the end of the existing licence fee charter period in April 2007. Describing his proposals as \"tough love\", Smith ordered the BBC to find a further \u00a31.1bn in funding from \"self-help\" measures, including efficiency savings and increased commercial income.</p> <p>Smith also announced plans to reform the BBC's self-governing status. The role of the board of governors was to be reviewed, along with the corporation's finances and fair trading commitments and the public service justification for new digital services such as News 24. He also confirmed a number of new licence fee concessions, including half-price fees for the blind and a free licence for the over-75s.</p> <p><strong>February 6: </strong>Dyke sanctioned the launch of a dedicated BBC online sports website. On the same day, BSkyB snatched the rights to cover the Bafta film awards ceremony from the corporation.</p> <p><strong>February 1: </strong>On his first official day in charge of the BBC, Dyke told an audience of 450 senior staff gathered at Television Centre to stop moaning or leave. He pledged to put programmes first and free up money to spend on them, starting with a \u00a310m reduction in the cost of hiring management consultants. </p> <p>His second main aim was to improve the BBC's internal culture. Dyke praised his predecessor Sir John's achievements, especially the launch of BBC Online.</p> <p><strong>January 31:</strong>Sir John's last day as director-general.</p> <p><strong>January 20: </strong>Dyke bowed to mounting pressure from critics and sold his \u00a36m holding in Granada - pre-empting a meeting with the BBC governors, after which he could have been ordered to sell the stake. In a statement, Dyke said he had decided to sell the shares to prevent his early days as director-general from being dominated by controversy. </p> <p><strong>January 16:</strong> It emerged that the BBC governors had given Dyke until the end of April - two months after taking over as director-general - to sell his Granada shares - valued at about \u00a36m. The disclosure prompted howls of protest about a possible conflict of interest. Dyke acquired the equity stake when Granada took over LWT. </p> <p><strong>January 1:</strong> Sir John became a lord, courtesy of the new year's honours list. On the same day, the BBC announced that he would be stepping down two months earlier than planned, at the end of January, giving credence to the theory that the life peerage formed part of a trade-off to prize his hands off the BBC tiller.</p> <p><strong>November 18 1999:</strong> In his first major public speech after being appointed director-general, Dyke pledged to place education at the heart of his strategy. </p> <p><strong>November 1 1999: </strong>Dyke joined the BBC as director-general designate, working alongside Sir John in a handover period due to last until the end of March 2000. The pair were to share adjoining offices. </p> <p>Dyke announced immediately that he would be overseeing a review of the relationship between the Broadcast directorate and other BBC divisions, including Production and the corporate centre. </p> <p>BBC observers took this as an indication that he intended to dismantle the corporate structure put in place by Sir John. The review was to take in TV commissioning, the four national radio services, new digital TV channels and BBC Online. Dyke would also take over direct control of Broadcast when chief executive Will Wyatt retired at the end of the year.</p> <p><strong>October 1 1999:</strong> Dyke resigned from the board of Manchester United.</p> <p><strong>August 29 1999:</strong> BBC1 controller Peter Salmon told the Guardian Edinburgh International TV Festival that he would be asking Dyke for an extra \u00a3100m in his annual budget to combat falling ratings. Salmon had faced mounting criticism because of falling ratings and the alleged dumbing down of BBC1 output. </p> <p><strong>August 19 1999:</strong> Dyke sold his remaining Pearson shares, netting \u00a3800,000.</p> <p><strong>August 5 1999:</strong> A government-appointed committee chaired by leading economist Gavyn Davies recommended that the BBC's future funding needs be met by introducing a digital licence fee. The Davies committee's report suggested the additional licence fee be levied from people with access to digital TV services. It would initially be set at \u00a324 from April 2000, but then fall as the uptake of digital services grew - to \u00a312 by 2006. </p> <p>The Davies report estimated that this measure, along with efficiency savings, the privatisation of BBC Resources and sale of a 49% stake in BBC Worldwide, would net the corporation an extra \u00a3150-200m a year over this period. </p> <p>The committee recommended that advertising, subscription or sponsorship should not be introduced to the BBC's core services. They also said the BBC's accounts should more transparent and open to greater scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading and National Audit Office, and that the licence fee discount for blind people should be increased to 50%.</p> <p>The Davies report's digital licence fee recommendation was criticised by Sir John for not providing sufficient money to meet the corporation's funding needs. The BBC submission to the Davies committee had asked for an extra \u00a3650m a year to fund new digital services and ensure its public service remit was not watered down. </p> <p>The digital licence fee proposal met with howls of protest from commercial media players, including the ITV companies and BSkyB, which said it would blight their efforts to sell digital TV services to the public.</p> <p><strong>August 2 1999: </strong>BBC executives were stunned by the defection of iconic sports presenter Des Lynam to ITV. Lynam signed a four-year deal reportedly worth \u00a35m, citing unhappiness with the late scheduling of Match of the Day as one reason for his move.</p> <p><strong>June 24 1999:</strong> In a brief statement, the BBC announced that Dyke would replace Sir John as director-general. The announcement followed an extraordinary few days of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvring and intrigue. The final decision to appoint Dyke had been taken the previous evening by BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland and the board of governors over dinner. </p> <p>Even at this stage, the governors remained split, with only seven of the 12 believed to have joined Bland - a close friend of Dyke's since their days working together as LWT chairman and chief executive, respectively - in approving his appointment. They had failed to reach agreement the previous week, amid newspaper reports that governors opposed to Dyke's candidacy, including vice-chairwoman Baroness Young, had threatened to resign over the issue - rumours officially denied by the BBC.</p> <p>The reason for the split was the controversy over Dyke's links to Labour and whether he would be impartial. Back in April, the Times had sparked a row over Dyke's political allegiences by revealing he had donated \u00a350,000 to Labour since 1994. </p> <p>Rival candidates - who included BBC News chief executive Tony Hall, ITV chief executive Richard Eyre and BBC director of television Alan Yentob - had also begun briefing against Dyke in the spring and early summer, as the odds on him landing the job shortened and the race to become BBC director-general came increasingly dirty.</p>",

The other services would be News 24 and two children's services, aimed at pre-school and six to 13-year-olds, which will go out on BBC3 and 4 during the daytime. Dyke also announced that the BBC would be spending an extra \u00a3480m on programmes and services within two years - a 30% increase in real terms over three years. More than half the extra money will be spent on BBC1 and 2, with BBC3 and 4 having a combined budget of \u00a3130m and the Nations and Regions getting an extra \u00a350m. August 7: BBC lobbying was reported to have persuaded the government not to abolish the board of governors. But the BBC governors are expected to have their powers curtailed and be made to report to a single independent regulator that will be created to oversee the broadcasting industry. August 6: The Sunday Times reported that Greg Dyke was planning to use his MacTaggart speech at the Edinburgh TV festival to unveil plans to reposition BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge as BBC3 and BBC4. The newspaper reported that BBC3 would be relaunched in April 2001 as a youth channel with a \u00a392m annual budget. BBC4, which is to be repositioned as a high-brow arts, science and politics channel, is expected to have a \u00a350m budget. Dyke was said to have discussed his plans with the BBC governors during their monthly meeting in July and to have described BBC4 as a \"virtual Tate Modern\". July 13: In his first appearance before the Commons media select committee as director-general, Dyke told MPs that the BBC needed to adapt to a digital multi-channel TV environment. He said BBC1 would largely become an entertainment channel, while assuring the committee that there would always be a place for current affairs. BBC2 would carry more serious output, while BBC Choice would become youth and comedy channel BBC3. BBC Knowledge would evolve into BBC4 - an arts and culture channel. July 12: Dyke failed in his bid to lure friend and former LWT colleague lord Melvyn Bragg to the BBC. Lord Bragg signed a lucrative four-year contract to remain LWT controller of arts and features. July 10: It was announced that up to 1,100 BBC jobs were to go as part of Dyke's restructuring of the organisation. Most of the job losses and 70% of accompanying savings were to come from support areas - including human resources, marketing and publicity, strategy and finance - and management, with around 200 posts expected to be axed from the resources division. The cuts form part of measures expected to produce savings of \u00a3750m over the next six years, as the BBC strives to meet Dyke's target of increasing the proportion of licence fee revenue it spends on programming and services from 76% to 85%. Dyke also unveiled further details of the new BBC corporate structure he would be introducing, including four new TV genre commissioners for entertainment, drama, factual and arts programming, who would work with the channel controllers. Within the factual and learning production division, 10 department heads were asked to compete for three new posts: head of documentaries and investigations, leisure and factual programming and specialist factual. A new head of religion and ethics post was also created within the division. Factual and learning was asked to work with BBC News to create a business programming department. The former drama and entertainment department management teams were to be merged and streamlined within the new drama, entertainment and children's production division, under Alan Yentob, who would also oversee a new innovative unit, Fictionlab. BBC Radio, headed by Jenny Abramsky, was renamed Radio &amp; Music. June 21: Dyke announced a further \u00a315m in funding for BBC1 and BBC2 - to come from efficiency savings - as the BBC unveiled its 1999-2000 annual report. In the face of criticism from the BBC governors that the average quality of BBC1 shows \"was still not good enough\", Dyke promised a \"fundamental change\" in the channel's performance. But he skirted around a question about whether BBC1 controller Peter Salmon was to blame for the channel's poor showing. The annual report also revealed that Dyke's predecessor, Sir John Birt, received a termination payment of \u00a3328,400 for retiring early. June 15: The BBC won back live rights to the FA Cup final from ITV. The corporation also secured live rights to England's home football internationals, as part of a \u00a3400m three-year deal with BSkyB. However, Dyke was forced to back-track on accusations of skulduggery by ITV and the Premiership in the earlier deal to wrest Match of the Day football highlights away from the BBC. Match of the Day will be revived for a handful of weekends each year to cover the FA Cup. June 14: Dyke, who arrived at the BBC promising to reverse the loss of key sports rights, suffered the biggest reversal of his tenure to date when ITV snatched Premiership highlights, effectively signalling the death-knell for Saturday night BBC1 institution Match of the Day. The BBC lost out despite doubling what it paid for the previous highlights deal - to \u00a3120m over three years. Dyke misjudged how much ITV wanted the rights; the commercial broadcaster bid \u00a3183m. June 12: In the first public indication of a major shift in the BBC's strategic thinking, director of television Mark Thompson announced plans to move from the mixed schedules offered by BBC1 and BBC2 to genre-based channels. In a speech at the Banff TV festival in Canada, which was drafted in close consultation with Dyke, he said there would be \"no sacred cows\" in a review of how the BBC should adapt its TV output for the digital multi-channel era. Thompson added that genre-based channels would allow the BBC to extend, rather than dilute, its public service remit. But the speech aroused immediate fears that the BBC was planning to dumb down its TV output and turn BBC1 into an entertainment service, shifting news and serious documentaries and current affairs to BBC2. On the same day, it was announced that BBC director of public policy Patricia Hodgson was leaving the corporation to become Independent Television Commission chief executive. Hodgson was regarded as one of Sir John Birt's most trusted lieutenants, and her role had already been diminished under Dyke. June 5: ITV controller of children's and youth Nigel Pickard, who worked for Dyke at TVS in the 80s, was poached to become BBC controller of children's programmes. May 20: Grandstand, the BBC's flagship Saturday afternoon sports programme, was cancelled because of a lack of decent events to show. The 42-year-old institution, which had previously only come off air during annual holiday periods and the funeral of Diana, princess of Wales, was the victim of the BBC's loss of sports rights. May 13: Dyke risked sparking a political row with the appointment of former Independent editor Andrew Marr as the BBC's political editor. Marr, who is regarded as left-leaning, was recruited by Dyke and head of news Tony Hall to replace Robin Oakley. Oakley, a former Times political editor with Conservative sympathies, was persuaded to retire a year early to make way for Marr. May 10: In a further cost-cutting measure, BBC department heads received a memo from Dyke informing them that in future croissants would not be served at breakfast meetings. May 2: A shuttle bus service was introduced to ferry staff between Broadcasting House in central London and Television Centre 'out west'. The move formed part of a Dyke-inspired clampdown on taxi costs. April 7: Dyke pledged to increase the proportion of BBC employees from ethnic minorities to 10%, and double the number of managers from ethnic backgrounds by 2003, in a speech at the race in the media awards dinner. He said people from ethnic minorities made up 8% of the BBC workforce, but only 2% of managers. April 3: Unveiling his strategic vision for \"One BBC\", Dyke promised to spend at least an extra \u00a3100m on programming and services in the coming year. He announced plans for a flatter management structure, with an 18-strong executive committee at its centre. Dyke also set a target of reducing the proportion of licence fee income spent on running the BBC from 24% to 15% over the next five years - in order to invest more in programming. He said this would free up \u00a3200m a year to spend on programmes and help meet the government's savings target of \u00a31.2bn over the next seven years. Dyke indicated that drama and entertainment would be top of the list for extra funding, but said neglected areas, such as local radio, would also benefit. Dyke said he wanted to bring programme-makers closer to the centre of decision-making - 10 out of the 18 executive committee members would be responsible for production or broadcasting, compared with four in the previous senior executive forum. As part of the management reorganisation, the much-maligned, Birt-inspired division between the BBC's broadcasting and production operations was abolished, along with the independent commissioning group. Four programming divisions were created: drama, entertainment &amp; children, factual and learning, sport &amp; news - along with a new media division to develop interactive TV and online operations. In sport, children's and education, commissioning and programme-making were reintegrated. All in-house producers were to be offered output guarantees and longer term commissions. And the BBC internal market was to be simplified, with the number of business units cut from 190 to 50. In radio, Abramsky was given responsibility for Radio 5 Live and music production - from the News and Production directorates, respectively. March 8: The BBC saw off Kelvin MacKenzie's TalkSport to retain radio rights to England's home cricket Tests, in a bid orchestrated by Dyke. The BBC was said to have paid about \u00a32m for the five-year deal. March 2: Helen Boaden was appointed Radio 4 controller, replacing James Boyle. February 21: Chris Smith announced a BBC funding settlement that gave it a rise in licence fee income equivalent to \u00a3200m a year over the next seven years. As a result, the licence fee for 2000-2001 would rise by 1.5% above inflation from April 1 - to \u00a3104. While offering the BBC more money, Smith neatly side-stepped the \u00a324 digital licence fee proposed by the Davies committee, which had been so roundly condemned by commercial rivals as a \"digital poll tax\". But the increase he offered was well below the extra \u00a33bn the BBC had asked for to see it through to the end of the existing licence fee charter period in April 2007. Describing his proposals as \"tough love\", Smith ordered the BBC to find a further \u00a31.1bn in funding from \"self-help\" measures, including efficiency savings and increased commercial income. Smith also announced plans to reform the BBC's self-governing status. The role of the board of governors was to be reviewed, along with the corporation's finances and fair trading commitments and the public service justification for new digital services such as News 24. He also confirmed a number of new licence fee concessions, including half-price fees for the blind and a free licence for the over-75s. February 6: Dyke sanctioned the launch of a dedicated BBC online sports website. On the same day, BSkyB snatched the rights to cover the Bafta film awards ceremony from the corporation. February 1: On his first official day in charge of the BBC, Dyke told an audience of 450 senior staff gathered at Television Centre to stop moaning or leave. He pledged to put programmes first and free up money to spend on them, starting with a \u00a310m reduction in the cost of hiring management consultants. His second main aim was to improve the BBC's internal culture. Dyke praised his predecessor Sir John's achievements, especially the launch of BBC Online. January 31:Sir John's last day as director-general. January 20: Dyke bowed to mounting pressure from critics and sold his \u00a36m holding in Granada - pre-empting a meeting with the BBC governors, after which he could have been ordered to sell the stake. In a statement, Dyke said he had decided to sell the shares to prevent his early days as director-general from being dominated by controversy. January 16: It emerged that the BBC governors had given Dyke until the end of April - two months after taking over as director-general - to sell his Granada shares - valued at about \u00a36m. The disclosure prompted howls of protest about a possible conflict of interest. Dyke acquired the equity stake when Granada took over LWT. January 1: Sir John became a lord, courtesy of the new year's honours list. On the same day, the BBC announced that he would be stepping down two months earlier than planned, at the end of January, giving credence to the theory that the life peerage formed part of a trade-off to prize his hands off the BBC tiller. November 18 1999: In his first major public speech after being appointed director-general, Dyke pledged to place education at the heart of his strategy. November 1 1999: Dyke joined the BBC as director-general designate, working alongside Sir John in a handover period due to last until the end of March 2000. The pair were to share adjoining offices. Dyke announced immediately that he would be overseeing a review of the relationship between the Broadcast directorate and other BBC divisions, including Production and the corporate centre. BBC observers took this as an indication that he intended to dismantle the corporate structure put in place by Sir John. The review was to take in TV commissioning, the four national radio services, new digital TV channels and BBC Online. Dyke would also take over direct control of Broadcast when chief executive Will Wyatt retired at the end of the year. October 1 1999: Dyke resigned from the board of Manchester United. August 29 1999: BBC1 controller Peter Salmon told the Guardian Edinburgh International TV Festival that he would be asking Dyke for an extra \u00a3100m in his annual budget to combat falling ratings. Salmon had faced mounting criticism because of falling ratings and the alleged dumbing down of BBC1 output. August 19 1999: Dyke sold his remaining Pearson shares, netting \u00a3800,000. August 5 1999: A government-appointed committee chaired by leading economist Gavyn Davies recommended that the BBC's future funding needs be met by introducing a digital licence fee. The Davies committee's report suggested the additional licence fee be levied from people with access to digital TV services. It would initially be set at \u00a324 from April 2000, but then fall as the uptake of digital services grew - to \u00a312 by 2006. The Davies report estimated that this measure, along with efficiency savings, the privatisation of BBC Resources and sale of a 49% stake in BBC Worldwide, would net the corporation an extra \u00a3150-200m a year over this period. The committee recommended that advertising, subscription or sponsorship should not be introduced to the BBC's core services. They also said the BBC's accounts should more transparent and open to greater scrutiny by the Office of Fair Trading and National Audit Office, and that the licence fee discount for blind people should be increased to 50%. The Davies report's digital licence fee recommendation was criticised by Sir John for not providing sufficient money to meet the corporation's funding needs. The BBC submission to the Davies committee had asked for an extra \u00a3650m a year to fund new digital services and ensure its public service remit was not watered down. The digital licence fee proposal met with howls of protest from commercial media players, including the ITV companies and BSkyB, which said it would blight their efforts to sell digital TV services to the public. August 2 1999: BBC executives were stunned by the defection of iconic sports presenter Des Lynam to ITV. Lynam signed a four-year deal reportedly worth \u00a35m, citing unhappiness with the late scheduling of Match of the Day as one reason for his move. June 24 1999: In a brief statement, the BBC announced that Dyke would replace Sir John as director-general. The announcement followed an extraordinary few days of behind-the-scenes political manoeuvring and intrigue. The final decision to appoint Dyke had been taken the previous evening by BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland and the board of governors over dinner. Even at this stage, the governors remained split, with only seven of the 12 believed to have joined Bland - a close friend of Dyke's since their days working together as LWT chairman and chief executive, respectively - in approving his appointment. They had failed to reach agreement the previous week, amid newspaper reports that governors opposed to Dyke's candidacy, including vice-chairwoman Baroness Young, had threatened to resign over the issue - rumours officially denied by the BBC. The reason for the split was the controversy over Dyke's links to Labour and whether he would be impartial. Back in April, the Times had sparked a row over Dyke's political allegiences by revealing he had donated \u00a350,000 to Labour since 1994. Rival candidates - who included BBC News chief executive Tony Hall, ITV chief executive Richard Eyre and BBC director of television Alan Yentob - had also begun briefing against Dyke in the spring and early summer, as the odds on him landing the job shortened and the race to become BBC director-general came increasingly dirty.",

(The CBI) asked us for balance sheets which we handed over to them. They also wanted to know how the subcommittees were appointed and how they functioned. All the details were given to them. Besides this, nothing else was discussed,\" Muthiah says, although the CBI deny that the meeting was mutually arranged.</p> <p><strong>Saturday August 5</strong><br> Police in New Delhi arrest a third bookmaker, <strong>Sunil 'Bittoo' Dara</strong>, with alleged match-fixing links. This follows the earlier arrest of Rajesh Kalra and Kishan Kumar. </p> <p><strong>Sunday August 6</strong><br> An Indian website, tehelka.com, reports that <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong> and <strong>Salim Malik</strong> have paid up to \u00a3500,000 into each other's bank accounts.

In the third allegation, a person could not be testified. In the fourth, I have been found guilty not of match-fixing but attempting to fix the first Test match at Karachi in September 1994 against Australia ... The Inquiry Commission was convinced that a match can only be fixed by five or four players working together. It cannot be fixed by an individual or by two players ... The Commission should not have believed Shane Warne and Mark Waugh's testimony because of the admitted position that they themselves are self-confessed habitual gamblers.\" </p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 8</strong><br> In India, Deputy Finance Minister <strong>Dhananjaya Kumar</strong> announces in Parliament that tax officials have seized unaccounted wealth worth $900,000 during the nationwide raids, codenamed \"Operation Gentleman,\" conducted last month. But Finance Minister <strong>Yashwant Sinha</strong> says that the names of those with unaccounted assets will not yet be revealed. \"There will be no trial outside the court.

It makes no recommendations for disciplinary action, although it does allow the UCB to convene a disciplinary hearing on <strong> Herschelle Gibbs</strong>, <strong> Pieter Strydom </strong> and <strong> Henry Williams</strong>. No decision has been reached as to whether Hansie Cronje was completely honest during the hearing, and thus eligible for immunity from criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The UCB later confirms that hearings for Gibbs, Strydom and Williams will take place on August 19, with an announcement of any punishment to be made on August 28.</p> <p> <strong>Charles Williams</strong>, the father of Henry, accuses match-fixing investigators of racism. \"My son and Gibbs were offered money, but did not take it...How can their sporting careers be taken away from them?

While that might be his prerogative, it should be noted that the work of the Commission has not yet been finalised.\" </p> <p>The PCB's <strong> Lt Gen Tauqir Zia </strong> tells total-cricket.com that <strong> Salim Malik's </strong> life ban will not be withdrawn. \"Malik can go to the Supreme Court of Pakistan if he likes but the ban cannot be revoked.\"</p> <p><strong> Saturday August 12 </strong><br>On arrival in Australia for a one-day series, captain <strong> Shaun Pollock </strong> repeats his team's desire to put the match-fixing scandal behind them. \"If we can win this, it will go a long way to help people who have been feeling miserable about what has happened...I think it's only a matter of time before they can rally behind us 100 per cent, and maybe once the King Commission's findings are out it can be totally forgotten about.\"</p> <p><strong> Sunday August 13 </strong><br><strong> Income-tax authorities </strong> in India say that they are preparing a report on the findings of the raids on July 20/21, in which the lockers and houses of cricketers, administrators and bookmakers were searched.</p> <p><strong>Monday August 14</strong><br><strong>Shamila Batohi</strong>, the chief advocate of the King Commission, is to travel to India in an attempt to gain further evidence.

They were not responding to our queries properly and their attitude was not positive. They were also adopting delaying tactics but they met me recently and assured me that in future they will co-operate with the Sports Ministry.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday August 17</strong><br> BCCI treasurer <strong>Kishore Rungta</strong> appears before the CBI to clarify the Board's position on a number of issues, including the match-fixing scandal.</p> <p>King Commission spokesman <strong>John Bacon</strong> tells Times of India that chief prosecutor <strong>Shamila Batohi</strong> and investigator captain <strong>Geoff Edwards</strong> will spend a week in India. \"We cannot yet confirm when they will be leaving South Africa...They will certainly be wanting to talk to Azharuddin and also to listen closely to the tapes in the possession of the Indian police.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday August 18</strong><br> <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>, the current Indian coach, says that he is considering severing his ties with cricket. \"If this is what I get for being a cricketer, I do not want to be part of it. I know I am clean - I have nothing to hide. The investigations will prove that. But I am finished with cricket. It is not worth it. If they [the BCCI] want me for one more year, then fine. I will do the job to the best of my ability. But after that I will have nothing to do with cricket.\"</p> <p><strong>Sir Donald Bradman</strong> says that he expects cricket to survive its current nadir. In a message read by <strong>his son John</strong> at the inaugural Sir Donald Bradman oration in Melbourne, Bradman said, \"Despite recent sad developments, cricket will survive and remain our most noble game and I shall always remain proud of the part I played in its history and development.\"</p> <p><strong>Saturday August 19</strong><br> <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Henry Williams</strong> plead guilty to accusations of accepting $15,000 from Hansie Cronje to underperform in a Nagpur one-day international in March. A three-man tribunal will decide their fate, and that of Pieter Strydom, to be announced on August 28 or 29. </p> <p> <strong>Sunday August 20</strong><br> At its working committee meeting in Bangalore, the BCCI approves a code of conduct for players and officials. \"This code will come in to effect immediately, but when it is passed at the general body meeting, we will have more authority in enforcing it. In addition, all players, officials and team administrators will have to sign a declaration. This is a very important step for the future of the Indian Cricket Board\" says President <strong>AC Muthiah</strong>.</p> <p>Muthiah also announces plans to speak to Kapil Dev, in the light of his threats to quit as Indian coach. \"The Board has authorised me, the President, to call Mr Kapil Dev and have a discussion with him. They have also authorised me to take whatever decision I see fit in the interest of Indian cricket. I will be calling him shortly and taking a decision very soon on the subject.\" </p> <p> <strong>Monday August 21</strong><br> Indian police say that they have \"excellent evidence\" to support charges of match-fixing against Cronje.</p> <p>The Press Trust of India reveal that <strong>Ravi Shastri</strong>, the only man to have corroborated Manoj Prabhakar's claim that Kapil Dev attempted to bribe him in 1994, was recently questioned by CBI officials.</p> <p>PTI, quoting UCB sources, also say that \"[Herschelle] Gibbs is likely to be banned from international cricket for at least a year for his role in the Cronje match-fixing scandal, [Henry] Williams is likely to be fined, while [Pieter] Strydom is expected to escape with a caution.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 22</strong><br> <strong>Cronje</strong> has given an extensive interview to South African subscription channel M-Net, to be aired on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week. King Commission chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi confirms that she'll be tuning in. \"Rest assured, I'll be watching. Just like the rest of the country, I expect.\"</p> <p><strong>Wednesday August 23</strong><br>The Daily Mail reports that <strong>Chris Lewis</strong> is to write a book in which he will name the three English cricketers he was told had taken money to fix matches. Leicestershire coach Jack Birkenshaw said: \"If he (publishes) it will be the end of him as a player. He will not be able to write a book without permission. If he does as an active player, the ECB will be bound to suspend him.\" </p> <p><strong>Thursday August 24</strong><br> The King Commission's interim report is passed to the UCB. \"It is being made public on Friday. We will post it on the government's website,\" said spokesman <strong>Graham Abrahams</strong>. Meanwhile, <strong>R N Sawani</strong>, joint director of the CBI declares that he is \"satisfied\" with the progress being made in their match-fixing investigations. A preliminary report is being finalised and will be submitted to the Sports Ministry in September. </p> <p>In a three part TV interview on South African subscription channel M-Net, Cronje says that <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> should not receive further punishment for his part in the match-fixing scandal. \"In my opinion Herschelle should be given another chance to play.

You entertained the thought, you were tempted but you never followed through.\"</p> <p>South African sports minister <strong>Ngconde Balfour</strong> confirms that there are no major surprises in the King Commission interim report, which is published on cricket.co.za. \"There is not much in it really, no recommendations, nothing much. I am still of the opinion that there are only one or two people involved in this type of thing and we can easily clean up the game.\" The report makes no recommendations of disciplinary action, nor does it indicate whether Cronje will be granted immunity from criminal prosecution. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph reports that <strong>Judge King</strong> has asked the South African president Thabo Mbeki to widen his terms of reference. This would allow King to investigate match-fixing dating back to 1995. A commission source is quoted as saying, \"We don't know what happened between the 1995 offer (to throw an ODI against Pakistan) and early this year. Were there other attempts to bribe South African cricketers? The present terms of reference do not allow us to investigate.\"</p> <p><strong>Friday August 25</strong><br> In his interim report, <strong>Judge King</strong> takes a dim view of Hansie Cronje*s activities. \"There is a common thread to these events which is shared by others where Cronje sought to involve his team-mates in match-fixing or related matters and that is that the initial approach is made jocularly. It seems that this was Cronje*s modus operandi. He would sound out his colleagues, in a way which would enable him to say later, if the need arose, that he had only been joking.\" </p> <p>In the second part of his interview, <strong>Cronje</strong> praises the effective work of the match-fixing enquiry in South Africa: \"I think we have got to give credit to the way it is being handled here as opposed to in Australia. But I would rather have (Mark Waugh and Shane Warne*s) punishment.\" On rediff.com, CBI joint director R N Savani says that Kapil Dev will be summoned before the CBI shortly. \"No date has been fixed for the meeting, but it will take place.\"</p> <p>The BCCI submits a copy of its code of conduct to the Indian government.

Both Gibbs and Williams pleaded guilty to accepting money to underperform in a one-day international. In addition to the bans, Gibbs is fined 60,000 rand and Williams 10,000 rand. The bans do not preclude the pair from playing domestic cricket.</p> <p>In a prepared statement, Gibbs does not dispute his punishment. \"I am obviously bitterly disappointed that I will not be able to represent my country until next year. However, I am grateful that I will at least have the honour of being able to play for Western Province if so selected.\"</p> <p>Former BCCI president <strong>IS Bindra</strong> criticises the board's treatment of Kapil Dev. \"It is wrong on the part of the BCCI to gun for the team coach Kapil Dev though the board had earlier promised all help to him.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday August 29</strong><br>Speculation mounts that Cronje could face civil claims running into millions of rands from past and present team-mates who suffered financial losses in the match- fixing scandal. He may also have to pay legal costs incurred during the King Commission. On cricketline.com, a <strong>senior South African player</strong>, who asks not to be named, says that he would sue Cronje were he Herschelle Gibbs or Henry Williams. The player also says that Cronje approached players from the traditionally less privileged sectors of South African society \"to do his dirty work for him.\"</p> <p>In the Cape Times <strong>Herman Gibbs</strong>, father of Herschelle, is quoted as deeming the sentences \"bullshit - the boys have suffered enough. What I would like to know is who are the UCB accountable to in terms of their own misdemeanours when it comes to administering the game?\" </p> <p>Gibbs senior also tells rediff.com that he would like to <strong>sue</strong> Hansie Cronje for corrupting his son, and the UCB for failing to protect him from match-fixing. He says his son should act \"like a boxer stepping back into the ring after a bad blow\", and show that he is the best opener in South Africa.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday August 30</strong><br> In his cricketline.com column, <strong>Allan Donald</strong> expresses his relief that <strong>Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Henry Williams</strong> did not receive a longer sentence: \"Some people would say [Gibbs and Williams] deserved life bans. Neither of them actually went through with playing poorly on purpose but the fact that they even agreed to is very serious. They know now, though, that they've done wrong, and were both probably expecting suspended life bans. I'm glad the UCB wasn't too severe on them.\" </p> <p>New Zealand Cricket chief executive <strong>Chris Doig</strong> expresses his disappointment at the penalties meted out to Gibbs and Williams: \"I am surprised and disappointed at the leniency. For the sake of cricket we had to be seen to be taking a strong stance on match-fixing. On the basis the players appear to be guilty of being involved in some way of tacitly approving match-fixing, I think the penalties are modest.\"</p> <p>BCCI president <strong>AC Muthiah</strong> criticises <strong>IS Bindra</strong>, who had expressed his dissatisfaction with the board's treatment of <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>. \"Bindra could have made these remarks at the Bangalore meeting.

I can't say with hand on heart that I'm absolutely certain it hasn't happened, but I'd bet against it.\" The magazine also says that Atherton has played in a one-day international that he believes was fixed but, without evidence to support him, he has refused to name the game.</p> <p> <em>Watch this space</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tuesday August 1 Pastor Ray McCauley, the man to whom Hansie Cronje turned when the allegations against him become known, urges him not to cash in on his downfall. \"My advice to him would be to stop, stop right now ... I think that at this time ... it is important for him to be seen as somebody that is very repentant for what's happened and also that he needs to put back into the nation something other than just the fact that he's going to walk away from it.\" AC Muthiah, President of the BCCI, urges the Indian government to conclude match-fixing investigations as swiftly as possible. \"It is very demoralising for the team to play when you have a sword hanging over your head.\" Wednesday August 2 In New Delhi, income-tax officials open the bank locker of Ajay Jadeja, one of many sealed during the nationwide raids on July 20 and July 21. Thursday August 3 John Bacon, secretary of the King Commission, confirms that any money made by Hansie Cronje from book deals emanating from the match-fixing scandal will not be scrutinised by the commission. \"We only cover the period up to April 17 this year. Anything beyond that doesn't concern us ... That's his own private affair.\" Ajay Jadeja is questioned for over seven hours by income-tax officials. Afterwards he says he is innocent, and accuses the media of exaggerating the severity of the issue. An Indian website, tehelka.com, reports that Mohammad Azharuddin and Salim Malik have paid up to \u00a3500,000 into each other's bank accounts. An unnamed tax official is quoted as saying, \"Azharuddin should be behind bars for a decade ... we have proof that Mukesh Gupta paid for the Lokhandwala house of Azha ... After Hansie (Cronje) linked his name to Mukesh Gupta, Azhar went on a document burning spree. But we have still managed to get details ... If there is no political pressure we have innumerable grounds to arrest him soon.\" Friday August 4 BCCI president AC Muthiah, secretary Jaywant Lele and treasurer Kishore Rungta are interviewed by CBI officials in Delhi. \"This was a mutually arranged meeting ... (The CBI) asked us for balance sheets which we handed over to them. They also wanted to know how the subcommittees were appointed and how they functioned. All the details were given to them. Besides this, nothing else was discussed,\" Muthiah says, although the CBI deny that the meeting was mutually arranged. Saturday August 5 Police in New Delhi arrest a third bookmaker, Sunil 'Bittoo' Dara, with alleged match-fixing links. This follows the earlier arrest of Rajesh Kalra and Kishan Kumar. Sunday August 6 An Indian website, tehelka.com, reports that Mohammad Azharuddin and Salim Malik have paid up to \u00a3500,000 into each other's bank accounts. An unnamed tax official is quoted as saying, \"Azharuddin should be behind bars for a decade...we have proof that Mukesh Gupta paid for the Lokhandwala house of Azhar...After Hansie (Cronje) linked his name to Mukesh Gupta, Azhar went on a document-burning spree. But we have still managed to get details...If there is no political pressure we have innumerable grounds to arrest him soon.\" Monday August 7 In a letter to the PCB, Salim Malik pleads for the withdrawal of the lifetime ban imposed him in the Qayyum Report. \"There were four specific allegations of match-fixing against me and I have been found not guilty in two of them. In the third allegation, a person could not be testified. In the fourth, I have been found guilty not of match-fixing but attempting to fix the first Test match at Karachi in September 1994 against Australia ... The Inquiry Commission was convinced that a match can only be fixed by five or four players working together. It cannot be fixed by an individual or by two players ... The Commission should not have believed Shane Warne and Mark Waugh's testimony because of the admitted position that they themselves are self-confessed habitual gamblers.\" Tuesday August 8 In India, Deputy Finance Minister Dhananjaya Kumar announces in Parliament that tax officials have seized unaccounted wealth worth $900,000 during the nationwide raids, codenamed \"Operation Gentleman,\" conducted last month. But Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha says that the names of those with unaccounted assets will not yet be revealed. \"There will be no trial outside the court. We will maintain greatest circumspection to ensure that nobody is maligned. The government has not come to any conclusion and nobody will be named before the matter is fully examined.\" Wednesday August 9 Greg Melick, Australian cricket's new match-fixing watch-dog, has found no reason to believe Salim Malik's claim of a double fix in 1994. Malik has claimed that both Pakistan and Australia had been bribed to lose a one-day match between the sides in Colombo in 1994. \"Mr Melick has conducted a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the Salim Malik claims and established that there is no evidence to support such suggestions,\" says ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed. Friday August 11 The King Commission's interim report is published. It makes no recommendations for disciplinary action, although it does allow the UCB to convene a disciplinary hearing on Herschelle Gibbs, Pieter Strydom and Henry Williams. No decision has been reached as to whether Hansie Cronje was completely honest during the hearing, and thus eligible for immunity from criminal prosecution. The UCB later confirms that hearings for Gibbs, Strydom and Williams will take place on August 19, with an announcement of any punishment to be made on August 28. Charles Williams, the father of Henry, accuses match-fixing investigators of racism. \"My son and Gibbs were offered money, but did not take it...How can their sporting careers be taken away from them? I know other guys in the team are guilty, but they can play. Why can't the coloureds?\" Ngconde Balfour, the South African Minister of Sport, warns Hansie Cronje that the King Commission's work is not complete. \"I have also noted the intention of the former South African cricket captain, Hansie Cronje, to grant interviews to selected media as well as his apparent decision to write a book on his involvement in the matter. While that might be his prerogative, it should be noted that the work of the Commission has not yet been finalised.\" The PCB's Lt Gen Tauqir Zia tells total-cricket.com that Salim Malik's life ban will not be withdrawn. \"Malik can go to the Supreme Court of Pakistan if he likes but the ban cannot be revoked.\" Saturday August 12 On arrival in Australia for a one-day series, captain Shaun Pollock repeats his team's desire to put the match-fixing scandal behind them. \"If we can win this, it will go a long way to help people who have been feeling miserable about what has happened...I think it's only a matter of time before they can rally behind us 100 per cent, and maybe once the King Commission's findings are out it can be totally forgotten about.\" Sunday August 13 Income-tax authorities in India say that they are preparing a report on the findings of the raids on July 20/21, in which the lockers and houses of cricketers, administrators and bookmakers were searched. Monday August 14 Shamila Batohi, the chief advocate of the King Commission, is to travel to India in an attempt to gain further evidence. Her duties include listening to the tapes held by Indian police which originally led to the Commission being established. Wednesday August 16 On rediff.com, Leslie Sackstein, Hansie Cronje's lawyer, defends his client's \"democratic right\" to earn money through interviews, articles, books and films. \"I must point out that, as he was summarily dismissed as captain by Ali Bacher, my client has no source of income, and he is entitled to earn something.\" Indian Sports Minister SS Dhindsa complains about the BCCI's attitude towards the inquiry into the match-fixing scandal. \"I had some reservations against the BCCI. They were not responding to our queries properly and their attitude was not positive. They were also adopting delaying tactics but they met me recently and assured me that in future they will co-operate with the Sports Ministry.\" Thursday August 17 BCCI treasurer Kishore Rungta appears before the CBI to clarify the Board's position on a number of issues, including the match-fixing scandal. King Commission spokesman John Bacon tells Times of India that chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi and investigator captain Geoff Edwards will spend a week in India. \"We cannot yet confirm when they will be leaving South Africa...They will certainly be wanting to talk to Azharuddin and also to listen closely to the tapes in the possession of the Indian police.\" Friday August 18 Kapil Dev, the current Indian coach, says that he is considering severing his ties with cricket. \"If this is what I get for being a cricketer, I do not want to be part of it. I know I am clean - I have nothing to hide. The investigations will prove that. But I am finished with cricket. It is not worth it. If they [the BCCI] want me for one more year, then fine. I will do the job to the best of my ability. But after that I will have nothing to do with cricket.\" Sir Donald Bradman says that he expects cricket to survive its current nadir. In a message read by his son John at the inaugural Sir Donald Bradman oration in Melbourne, Bradman said, \"Despite recent sad developments, cricket will survive and remain our most noble game and I shall always remain proud of the part I played in its history and development.\" Saturday August 19 Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams plead guilty to accusations of accepting $15,000 from Hansie Cronje to underperform in a Nagpur one-day international in March. A three-man tribunal will decide their fate, and that of Pieter Strydom, to be announced on August 28 or 29. Sunday August 20 At its working committee meeting in Bangalore, the BCCI approves a code of conduct for players and officials. \"This code will come in to effect immediately, but when it is passed at the general body meeting, we will have more authority in enforcing it. In addition, all players, officials and team administrators will have to sign a declaration. This is a very important step for the future of the Indian Cricket Board\" says President AC Muthiah. Muthiah also announces plans to speak to Kapil Dev, in the light of his threats to quit as Indian coach. \"The Board has authorised me, the President, to call Mr Kapil Dev and have a discussion with him. They have also authorised me to take whatever decision I see fit in the interest of Indian cricket. I will be calling him shortly and taking a decision very soon on the subject.\" Monday August 21 Indian police say that they have \"excellent evidence\" to support charges of match-fixing against Cronje. The Press Trust of India reveal that Ravi Shastri, the only man to have corroborated Manoj Prabhakar's claim that Kapil Dev attempted to bribe him in 1994, was recently questioned by CBI officials. PTI, quoting UCB sources, also say that \"[Herschelle] Gibbs is likely to be banned from international cricket for at least a year for his role in the Cronje match-fixing scandal, [Henry] Williams is likely to be fined, while [Pieter] Strydom is expected to escape with a caution.\" Tuesday August 22 Cronje has given an extensive interview to South African subscription channel M-Net, to be aired on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week. King Commission chief prosecutor Shamila Batohi confirms that she'll be tuning in. \"Rest assured, I'll be watching. Just like the rest of the country, I expect.\" Wednesday August 23 The Daily Mail reports that Chris Lewis is to write a book in which he will name the three English cricketers he was told had taken money to fix matches. Leicestershire coach Jack Birkenshaw said: \"If he (publishes) it will be the end of him as a player. He will not be able to write a book without permission. If he does as an active player, the ECB will be bound to suspend him.\" Thursday August 24 The King Commission's interim report is passed to the UCB. \"It is being made public on Friday. We will post it on the government's website,\" said spokesman Graham Abrahams. Meanwhile, R N Sawani, joint director of the CBI declares that he is \"satisfied\" with the progress being made in their match-fixing investigations. A preliminary report is being finalised and will be submitted to the Sports Ministry in September. In a three part TV interview on South African subscription channel M-Net, Cronje says that Herschelle Gibbs should not receive further punishment for his part in the match-fixing scandal. \"In my opinion Herschelle should be given another chance to play. On the day he played superbly. Surely if you were told to get less than 20 and then you get 73 off 53 balls, then obviously you did not pay attention to what was said. You entertained the thought, you were tempted but you never followed through.\" South African sports minister Ngconde Balfour confirms that there are no major surprises in the King Commission interim report, which is published on cricket.co.za. \"There is not much in it really, no recommendations, nothing much.

Former CBI joint director K Madavan is confirmed as Commissioner of Inquiry. Saturday August 26 Cronje absolves Nicky Boje of any involvement in match-fixing. Boje had been mentioned in alleged telephone calls between Cronje and an Indian bookmaker. Sunday August 27 Income-tax officials in India raid the residence of off-spinner Nikhil Chopra in connection with their match-fixing investigations. Monday August 28 Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams are banned from international cricket until January 1, 2001, while Pieter Strydom is acquitted of a charge of attempting to place a bet during the 5th Test between South Africa and England.

Jackson is a fine example of that old adage: \"You can take the man out of journalism, but you can't take the journalist out of the man.\" Respondents to Mediatheguardian.com's straw poll confirms he has a reputation for being very full on and will know more about your company than you do.</p> <p><strong>Justin Walters</strong> <br>Former head of Guardian Unlimited, Walters' current buzzword is b2b. Sometimes, particularly after a few beers, he can enthuse too readily about the wonders and magic of b2b - to the extent that no one can understand him.

Mark Alexander, sales manager at Eurosport, is good fun and always keen to get the drinks in - courtesy of an expense account that seems to have no bounds.

Lines was voted new media personality of the year at last year's Boobnight awards. </p> <p><strong>Richard Lord </strong> <br>Lord, editor of Revolution, is probably one of the strangest people you will come across at these events. He can usually be found lingering by the food or throwing food at people across the room, which probably explains his svelte form. Get there early and you will be guaranteed to see Lord seemingly shit-faced and far too energetic for anyone who claims to work as hard as he does. Regardless, he always seems to have a good time and anyone looking for a fast-track into the industry should make an effort to schmooze the inimitable Lord. </p> <p><strong>Sophie Silocchi </strong> <br>'Who's that glamorous babe at the bar?' is the question always buzzing around the room when Guardian Unlimited's very own Sophie Silocchi, PR guru extraordinaire and organiser of the Clerkenwell Social, puts in an appearance. In many ways, Silocchi's presence adds a rare element of class to the new media party scene; there are those that swear how her immaculate appearance inadvertently encourages them to don designerwear.</p> <p><strong>Geoff Inns</strong> <br>No party is complete without Geoffrey 'hot stuff' Inns, hardcore Boobnighter and a veritable treat for the ladies of new media. Shy and unassuming Inns can brighten up a room with just a smile and the words 'corporate Amex'.

She is a good person to get to know, although, be warned, she is very fussy about clients and may even poo-poo your business plan if it has holes in the small print.</p> <p><strong>Julian Hardy</strong> <br>Be careful what you say to and about Hardy, former managing director of Freeserve and now at large, as you may end up working with him at some time. Also, it is best not to make a joke about how many jobs he has had over the past two years, or where he is currently working. Described by those in the know as \"a little bit wooo, a little bit wheh...\", Hardy is certainly not boring, although a party people pollster could not think of a time when they had actually seen him legless.

      "bodyText": "Nick Denton Some of those who knew Denton before his First Tuesday and Moreover.com days have described him as \"smug\" but it has to be acknowledged that he was the driving force behind First Tuesday and the reason why there are so many new media parties. Nick, we salute you. Tim Jackson He may be the much-talked about founder of QXL and often talked about in the same breath as Tim Berners Lee, but Jackson is a journalist at heart. Jackson is a fine example of that old adage: \"You can take the man out of journalism, but you can't take the journalist out of the man.\" Respondents to Mediatheguardian.com's straw poll confirms he has a reputation for being very full on and will know more about your company than you do. Justin Walters Former head of Guardian Unlimited, Walters' current buzzword is b2b. Sometimes, particularly after a few beers, he can enthuse too readily about the wonders and magic of b2b - to the extent that no one can understand him. Walters has been described as having the biggest brain on the planet, by those who are perhaps jealous of him. Mark Alexander AKA new media teddy bear. Mark Alexander, sales manager at Eurosport, is good fun and always keen to get the drinks in - courtesy of an expense account that seems to have no bounds. He always has a smile on his face and a funny story to tell. Be nice to him and you may get tickets to the next big European football game. Davina Lines Davina Lines, commercial director at Netimperative, knows everyone, having been in new media for more than five years. She was part of the founding team at New Media Age, and was instrumental in organising the NMA awards, conferences and parties. Lines was voted new media personality of the year at last year's Boobnight awards. Richard Lord Lord, editor of Revolution, is probably one of the strangest people you will come across at these events. He can usually be found lingering by the food or throwing food at people across the room, which probably explains his svelte form. Get there early and you will be guaranteed to see Lord seemingly shit-faced and far too energetic for anyone who claims to work as hard as he does. Regardless, he always seems to have a good time and anyone looking for a fast-track into the industry should make an effort to schmooze the inimitable Lord. Sophie Silocchi 'Who's that glamorous babe at the bar?' is the question always buzzing around the room when Guardian Unlimited's very own Sophie Silocchi, PR guru extraordinaire and organiser of the Clerkenwell Social, puts in an appearance. In many ways, Silocchi's presence adds a rare element of class to the new media party scene; there are those that swear how her immaculate appearance inadvertently encourages them to don designerwear. Geoff Inns No party is complete without Geoffrey 'hot stuff' Inns, hardcore Boobnighter and a veritable treat for the ladies of new media. Shy and unassuming Inns can brighten up a room with just a smile and the words 'corporate Amex'. Convince him to groove on down on the dancefloor and you're in for a rare display of agility and natural rhythm. Guardian Unlimited is just not going to be the same without him. Let's hope that Questico still allows him to come out to play. Narda Shirley As managing director of top new media PR agency Gnash, Narda can be normally spotted in her natural habitat of First Tuesday, where she has the task of ensuring everyone meets who they want to meet. The fact that Shirley knows everyone in the new media business, is well liked and very smart means she is 2:1 odds on gaining the title Queen of Networking. She is a good person to get to know, although, be warned, she is very fussy about clients and may even poo-poo your business plan if it has holes in the small print. Julian Hardy Be careful what you say to and about Hardy, former managing director of Freeserve and now at large, as you may end up working with him at some time. Also, it is best not to make a joke about how many jobs he has had over the past two years, or where he is currently working. Described by those in the know as \"a little bit wooo, a little bit wheh...\", Hardy is certainly not boring, although a party people pollster could not think of a time when they had actually seen him legless. His excuse? He drives everywhere in his Porsche, which he will talk about for hours if you let him. Hester Bloch Bloch, former community marketing director of WebRewards, left recently to join SMS messaging and community service Quios.com.She has been a regular on the new media party scene since the dawn of time, and is a strong contender to pick up the coveted Queen of Networking prize. Bloch has been out of the limelight of late, however, having committed herself to Mr MediaPlanning. She now only tends to make appearances at award shows, decked out in slinky, figure-hugging numbers. Having worked in the new media agency world for years, she is also well versed in the art of avoiding annoying techies and hanging out with only the cream of the social scene. Double act: Julian \"Meatloaf\" Marszalek and Nick Watt Old stooges Marszalek, sales manager at 365, and Watt, erstwhile managing director StudentUK, once toured the clubs and bars of Manchester, pumping out their eclectic blend of acid jazz. But that was in the days before the advent of new media. Nowadays, the closest Marszalek and Watt get to resuming their rock star heydays is at industry parties, where the two are often found hunched together musing about their wayward pasts and anything to do with the music industry. A word of advice comes courtesy of a \"close friend\", who warns wannabe networkers not to get Marszalek and Watt onto the subject of music, or else you could be \"bored rigid about deleted B sides all night\". Point taken.",

Then he goes and ruins the fa\u00e7ade by being nice. </p> <p>Glen is at that position in an actor's career where he is the first choice for a certain recognisable television role - the boyish, slightly off-kilter, but down-to-earth bloke who understands women, typified by his sports journalist in Glasgow Kiss - but not to the extent that he has been typecast, meaning that he can play a cad too. The ITV two-parter Anchor Me seems perfectly suited to his particular abilities. He plays Nathan, a Somerset boy who has educated himself out of his class, returning home to his dying mother with the hope of making his family face up to the death of a younger brother. What starts off as typical Barratt-Homes Sunday-night middle-England drama develops into a web of intrigue spun by fraught emotions, with the classic British trait of keeping up appearances at the root of all the problems. </p> <p>\"I was really drawn to it because it was one of those rare projects where you don't spend half of your time building bridges and subtexting things that aren't there,\" says Glen. \"This felt more like classical writing - you reach as far into it as you possibly can. It's not about you trying to improve it, it's about you trying to meet its potential.\" </p> <p>Glen's character is also trying to deal with a communication breakdown with his son, and a loss of excitement in marriage, on top of coming to terms with the long-buried family tragedy. On returning home he reaches back into the salad days of his childhood as all these crises loom down on him, and unfortunately finds consolation in the arms of his teenage sweetheart, now married to his rather brutish brother. </p> <p>\"Most television dramas are simplified to the point where you only have a simple objective to convey by a simple line, but the stuff of life is often where we're saying we're incredibly happy with something when in fact we're fiercely jealous and so on. So when writing conveys that, it's easier to play because you're immediately in a familiar situation. Underpinning the whole drama is the idea that people don't communicate, that people miscommunicate.\" </p> <p>Another theme is the sibling rivalry between the one who escapes from the nest and the one left to fend for the family in the shadow of the more glamorous other. Surprisingly, Glen claims to be of the latter category. \"As my brother so touchingly put it in his best man speech at my wedding, he didn't recognise I had a personality until I was 18, so it was hard to remember anything flattering to say about me. I always felt in his shadow - I'd like to put it down to the fact that he was four years older than me, but maybe it was just that I wasn't capable at very much. It's difficult to speak about such things without sounding pretentious, but you use this kind of experience for acting - it's broadly what you would call emotional memory.\" </p> <p>Glen was half of the phenomenon that was last year's The Blue Room, in which he played opposite Nicole Kidman as a series of clients to her prostitute at London's tiny Donmar Warehouse theatre. </p> <p>\"It was great,\" he says of working with his leggy Australian co-star. \"Within two minutes of working with her, I forgot who she was and we just got on with it. There was only two of us and we had a lot of work to do. We had to find all these various sexual couplings and not end up being Nic and Iain. Does a prostitute kiss a taxi driver differently to a politician? That sort of thing.\" Glen has remained friends with Kidman and her husband Tom Cruise. \"Our kids are the same age,\" he says, understatedly. \"We put them together and go off for a game of golf.\" </p> <p>Although not on a Cruise and Kidman level of fame, Glen has reached that stage where he is sometimes mistaken for his characters. \"I played a serial killer once, and had men coming up to me who had decided I was fucking hard and dangerous, and they wanted to be hard and dangerous too. When it happens I either get very mincey, or run.\" Recent projects could up the danger ante further. He played a cad in last year's adaptation of Wives And Daughters, and next year his diabolical villain will bring a British flavour to Tomb Raider. \"It has an English setting - and I've got to be careful here because we've all signed secrecy contracts - but the director has given each of the characters a whole world. Lara's looking for mysterious elements for the good of the world, and I'm doing it to destroy. I'm enjoying it immensely. We were shooting at Battersea Power Station at night, and the whole sky was lit up, vast machines were going through the shots, smoke everywhere, multicoloured welding effects falling from the skies, and I'm thinking, what am I doing here, I'm from Scotland! But my character was making it all happen. It's a real treat.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Anchor Me, Sunday, 9pm, ITV</p>",

I always felt in his shadow - I'd like to put it down to the fact that he was four years older than me, but maybe it was just that I wasn't capable at very much. It's difficult to speak about such things without sounding pretentious, but you use this kind of experience for acting - it's broadly what you would call emotional memory.\" Glen was half of the phenomenon that was last year's The Blue Room, in which he played opposite Nicole Kidman as a series of clients to her prostitute at London's tiny Donmar Warehouse theatre. \"It was great,\" he says of working with his leggy Australian co-star. \"Within two minutes of working with her, I forgot who she was and we just got on with it. There was only two of us and we had a lot of work to do. We had to find all these various sexual couplings and not end up being Nic and Iain. Does a prostitute kiss a taxi driver differently to a politician? That sort of thing.\" Glen has remained friends with Kidman and her husband Tom Cruise. \"Our kids are the same age,\" he says, understatedly. \"We put them together and go off for a game of golf.\" Although not on a Cruise and Kidman level of fame, Glen has reached that stage where he is sometimes mistaken for his characters. \"I played a serial killer once, and had men coming up to me who had decided I was fucking hard and dangerous, and they wanted to be hard and dangerous too. When it happens I either get very mincey, or run.\" Recent projects could up the danger ante further. He played a cad in last year's adaptation of Wives And Daughters, and next year his diabolical villain will bring a British flavour to Tomb Raider. \"It has an English setting - and I've got to be careful here because we've all signed secrecy contracts - but the director has given each of the characters a whole world. Lara's looking for mysterious elements for the good of the world, and I'm doing it to destroy. I'm enjoying it immensely. We were shooting at Battersea Power Station at night, and the whole sky was lit up, vast machines were going through the shots, smoke everywhere, multicoloured welding effects falling from the skies, and I'm thinking, what am I doing here, I'm from Scotland! But my character was making it all happen. It's a real treat.\" \u0095 Anchor Me, Sunday, 9pm, ITV",

Early this morning, eight vans were drawn across the entrance to the tunnel terminal near Calais, where motorists board shuttle services to the UK. There was pushing and shoving, but police remained on the sidelines, saying their involvement might precipitate violence. The fishermen have promised to let limited numbers of cars through every hour. But fishing union secretary Andre Fauchet is adamant that the blockade will remain until their demands are met. Thousands of holiday makers are still stuck in queues on both sides of the Channel, with all the major ports now blockaded as a result of protests in France against high fuel prices. All ferry sailings on the key Dover-Calais route had to be cancelled in a dispute set to last for at least three more days as the demonstrations spread. Protesters added Le Havre to the list of blockaded ports overnight but had spared Channel tunnel services until now - the last gateway into France from Britain still open. The eight fishing boats that have caused severe disruption to Channel crossings were still moored across the harbour at Calais this morning, preventing any ferries from docking. This morning, around 1,000 fishermen gathered outside the ministry of agriculture fisheries directorate in Paris to protest further, throwing beer bottles and setting off distress flares. Riot police remained on standby. As the blockade enters its second day, there are fears that truckers will block routes into France from Zeebrugge in Belgium where thousands of British holiday makers and truckers have been diverted on cross-Channel ferries from Dover to cause even more mayhem. Kent also faces further traffic chaos today. Hundreds of lorries have been parked up overnight on two sections of the M20 after Kent police implemented Operation Stack to turn the motorway into a huge parking lot. If the crisis worsens, then another large section of the motorway will have to be closed to traffic and used to hold even more trucks. The aim of the operation is to stagger the number of trucks heading to the Kent ports and Channel tunnel to stop them grinding to a halt with gridlocked trucks. Around 18 miles of the motorway have already been closed but police say they already have contingency plans to close another section further up the M20. Cars and other traffic have been diverted on to the A20, running parallel to the motorway. But this morning it was already busy.

We hope it doesn't come down to this and that the blockade is lifted today.\" Meanwhile in France, lorries were stacked up along four miles of the main autoroute into Calais with hundreds of British truckers forced to spend the night in their cabs on the carriageway. They were being told to expect delays of up to five hours before they could get onto shuttles to bring them through the Channel tunnel, though that plan is in jeopardy now that French truckers have starting blocking that lifeline. Tom Evans, 53, from Cardiff, said: \"The problem has been not being able to get any sleep because you have to stay awake to keep moving with the queue. We are sick and tired of these strikes. It is high time something was done to stop them.\"",

She joined the corporation in 1979 as a news trainee and rose through the ranks of the current affairs department, working on Newsnight, Panorama and 60 Minutes. Heggessey went on to work for Thames TV current affairs show This Week and Channel 4 factual strands Hard News and Dispatches.</p> <p>She returned to the BBC in 1991 to oversee science department shows including Animal Hospital, QED and The Human Body. By October 1997 Heggessey had itchy feet once more. She was set to join former boss George Carey at indie Mentorn Barraclough Carey, when BBC Production chief executive Ron Neil approached her about the children's job. Two years later Heggessey was promoted to become BBC Production's deputy chief executive and director of programmes. She moved to her present job in April 2000, after the Production directorate was broken up in new BBC director general Greg Dyke's reorganisation of the corporation. </p> <p>Doubters will question whether Heggessey has the breadth of experience needed for the BBC1 controller's job. But unlike many BBC colleagues, Heggessey has experience in the commercial TV sector, having spent five years working for ITV and Channel 4. Her time at BBC children's gave her a taste for drama and entertainment. And with her no nonsense approach, Heggessey is likely to see eye-to-eye with Dyke.</p>",

Heggessey went on to work for Thames TV current affairs show This Week and Channel 4 factual strands Hard News and Dispatches. She returned to the BBC in 1991 to oversee science department shows including Animal Hospital, QED and The Human Body. By October 1997 Heggessey had itchy feet once more. She was set to join former boss George Carey at indie Mentorn Barraclough Carey, when BBC Production chief executive Ron Neil approached her about the children's job. Two years later Heggessey was promoted to become BBC Production's deputy chief executive and director of programmes. She moved to her present job in April 2000, after the Production directorate was broken up in new BBC director general Greg Dyke's reorganisation of the corporation. Doubters will question whether Heggessey has the breadth of experience needed for the BBC1 controller's job. But unlike many BBC colleagues, Heggessey has experience in the commercial TV sector, having spent five years working for ITV and Channel 4. Her time at BBC children's gave her a taste for drama and entertainment. And with her no nonsense approach, Heggessey is likely to see eye-to-eye with Dyke.",

      "body": "<p>The Wayans brothers have finally arrived. Not just for their interview - for which they are fashionably late - but as a comedy dynasty. Last month saw the successful US opening of Scary Movie, the Airplane-like spoof of body-count horror flicks such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, 42, and showcasing the acting and writing talents of younger brothers Shawn, 29, and Marlon, 27, Scary Movie took $42m at the box office in its first weekend. </p> <p>As TV actors and stand-up comedians, the Wayanses have enjoyed assorted levels of individual success. On the big screen, they have appeared together in various combinations in Hollywood Shuffle (1987), I'm Gonna Get You Sucka (1988), Mo' Money (1992) and Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996). But they are not a package deal like, say, the Marx brothers, more a mutual-admiration society who do much of their best work together. </p> <p>Now, with Scary Movie, whose multiracial cast includes Carmen Electra, they have established themselves as a force with which Hollywood will have to reckon. \"I think this is what's going to lift the whole dynasty off,\" says Bob Weinstein, who released the film through his company Miramax. \"This is going to widen their audience even more.\" </p> <p>Over breakfast in Beverley Hills, Keenen, Shawn, Marlon and Damon, 39, show little doubt about their potential. \"We're the black Beatles,\" jokes Shawn. </p> <p>\"This movie is There's Something About Mary funny, which is funny to everybody,\" says Damon. \"And I'm not even in it.\" </p> <p>Along with the banter comes a sense of how the brothers work together. \"We know each other's sensibility,\" Keenen says. \"If Damon comes and gives me a note, I listen, because he's my third eye. Same with these two guys. We energise each other.\" </p> <p>Some of the energy comes from \"a friendly competition\", says Damon. \"If I'm in a scene with Keenen and I look him in the eye, I know that if I don't get the laugh, he's gonna get it. That keeps everybody raising the bar.\" </p> <p>Watching the Wayans brothers together on the set of Scary Movie left Weinstein more than impressed. \"I work with my brother, and I see their interaction and it makes me laugh,\" he says. \"Marlon and Shawn wrote the script but, being their brother, Keenen didn't have to be nice about telling them, 'Go write it over 20 more times.' \" </p> <p>The conversation keeps drifting back to a more humble location: the Robert Fulton Houses, a housing project in the Chelsea area of Manhattan. All 10 Wayans children (from oldest to youngest, Dwayne, Keenen, Deidre, Damon, Kim, Elvira, Nadia, Devon, Shawn and Marlon) spent at least part of their childhood there. These four sons of Howell (who sold condoms for a living) and Elvira Wayans recall their early days as bittersweet. </p> <p>Keenen remembers the day his family moved into \"the projects\" as the happiest of his mother's life. They had been living in a Harlem tenement that was \"rat-infested, with lots of junkies. Every day my mother was fighting to keep us from getting hurt. I remember her looking out our window when we got to the projects and seeing a garage across the street, and just smiling. But it was one of the first integrated projects in Manhattan, and the racial tension was unbelievable. Grown people were throwing bottles at us. My mother wound up getting into fistfights on a regular basis. But a lot of that subsided. By the time Marlon and Shawn came along...\" </p> <p>\"We were dating white women,\" Marlon breaks in, with a hearty laugh. </p> <p>Eventually, Keenen says, the projects became \"a really fun place - no crime, no racism\". But the Wayanses hardly enjoyed a worry-free existence. Simply feeding all those mouths was difficult: breakfast was puffed-rice cereal bought in bulk; lunch was grilled-cheese sandwiches with, as Shawn describes it, \"government cheese\". Sometimes they ate \"peanut butter or jelly\", Marlon adds. \"We never had peanut butter and jelly.\" </p> <p>Keenen was the first Wayans to want to be a comedian. \"I had the dream since I was six, but I didn't want to hear anything negative about it, so I never told anyone.\" The comedy god in the Wayans household was Richard Pryor, and even though their mother, who had been a social worker, pushed education, a turning point came when Keenen decided to drop out of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. </p> <p>\"I'll never forget the night Keenen sat on the dryer and told my mother he was quitting college after three and a half years of engineering school to go to California and pursue acting and stand-up,\" Marlon says. </p> <p>Their mother was furious. But, Shawn adds, she pitched into Keenen \"very poetically. We watched that as kids, and I had to applaud him. That was the biggest impact on my life in terms of thinking, 'You can do it.' It took such bravery.\" </p> <p>Keenen believes that the siblings' difficult childhood explains the concentration of comic talent. \"Comedy is pain,\" he claims. \"You can't be funny if you haven't experienced pain. You can be witty, but the real comic stars - Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison - were in deep pain and stand-up was a cathartic experience.\" </p> <p>Comedy also requires discipline, and there was plenty of that. \"We had a father who ran a tight ship,\" says Damon. \"You didn't want to experience the wrath of Howell. And my mom was a real lioness when you crossed her kids.\" </p> <p>All four Wayanses agree that their mother is probably the funniest member of the family, but only when angered. \"When my mom's mad, she's a genius,\" Damon says. \"When she's not, she's corny. She's clever - a lot of plays on words. But when she gets mad, that's when you pull up a chair.\" </p> <p>Though the Wayans men are more famous, according to Marlon, \"the women in our family are hilarious.\" So why do the men dominate professionally? </p> <p>\"I think women have a harder time with rejection,\" Keenen says. \"I always used to say you have to be impervious to the word no. No means not right now. It definitely can't mean no. That's why people who have less fare better in show business: because they're not accustomed to getting it the first time around.\" </p> <p>Audiences were first exposed to the Wayans family through the early-90s comedy show In Living Color, in which Keenen was the driving force. The series featured Kim, Damon, Dwayne, Shawn and Marlon, as well as Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx. By the time it became a hit, there was a new attitude in the Wayans home. When Marlon had to decide between university and the family business, he found his mother \"sitting on a whole new washing machine with her fur and diamonds, going: 'Baby, don't be a jackass. Do like Keenen - go take yourself out there and become an actor.' \" </p> <p>In 1995 he joined Shawn for The Wayans Brothers, a TV show that was regarded as a hit only with black audiences. But the Wayanses have their doubts about the picture of the US provided by the Nielsen TV ratings system. </p> <p>\"I don't know any brothers with Nielsen boxes,\" Marlon says. </p> <p>\"I think it's all based on suburban homes,\" adds Shawn. </p> <p>Now there's no arguing with the brothers' success. But Keenen sees no danger of the kind of feuding that often splits show-business families. \"The rifts that most families have are not the results of show business; they're the result of a shaky foundation,\" he says. \"We have a very strong foundation. Show business is not strong enough to divide us.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Scary Movie is released on September 8.</p>",

But it was one of the first integrated projects in Manhattan, and the racial tension was unbelievable. Grown people were throwing bottles at us. My mother wound up getting into fistfights on a regular basis. But a lot of that subsided. By the time Marlon and Shawn came along...\" \"We were dating white women,\" Marlon breaks in, with a hearty laugh. Eventually, Keenen says, the projects became \"a really fun place - no crime, no racism\". But the Wayanses hardly enjoyed a worry-free existence. Simply feeding all those mouths was difficult: breakfast was puffed-rice cereal bought in bulk; lunch was grilled-cheese sandwiches with, as Shawn describes it, \"government cheese\". Sometimes they ate \"peanut butter or jelly\", Marlon adds. \"We never had peanut butter and jelly.\" Keenen was the first Wayans to want to be a comedian. \"I had the dream since I was six, but I didn't want to hear anything negative about it, so I never told anyone.\" The comedy god in the Wayans household was Richard Pryor, and even though their mother, who had been a social worker, pushed education, a turning point came when Keenen decided to drop out of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. \"I'll never forget the night Keenen sat on the dryer and told my mother he was quitting college after three and a half years of engineering school to go to California and pursue acting and stand-up,\" Marlon says. Their mother was furious. But, Shawn adds, she pitched into Keenen \"very poetically. We watched that as kids, and I had to applaud him. That was the biggest impact on my life in terms of thinking, 'You can do it.' It took such bravery.\" Keenen believes that the siblings' difficult childhood explains the concentration of comic talent. \"Comedy is pain,\" he claims. \"You can't be funny if you haven't experienced pain. You can be witty, but the real comic stars - Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison - were in deep pain and stand-up was a cathartic experience.\" Comedy also requires discipline, and there was plenty of that. \"We had a father who ran a tight ship,\" says Damon. \"You didn't want to experience the wrath of Howell. And my mom was a real lioness when you crossed her kids.\" All four Wayanses agree that their mother is probably the funniest member of the family, but only when angered. \"When my mom's mad, she's a genius,\" Damon says. \"When she's not, she's corny. She's clever - a lot of plays on words. But when she gets mad, that's when you pull up a chair.\" Though the Wayans men are more famous, according to Marlon, \"the women in our family are hilarious.\" So why do the men dominate professionally? \"I think women have a harder time with rejection,\" Keenen says. \"I always used to say you have to be impervious to the word no. No means not right now. It definitely can't mean no. That's why people who have less fare better in show business: because they're not accustomed to getting it the first time around.\" Audiences were first exposed to the Wayans family through the early-90s comedy show In Living Color, in which Keenen was the driving force. The series featured Kim, Damon, Dwayne, Shawn and Marlon, as well as Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx. By the time it became a hit, there was a new attitude in the Wayans home. When Marlon had to decide between university and the family business, he found his mother \"sitting on a whole new washing machine with her fur and diamonds, going: 'Baby, don't be a jackass. Do like Keenen - go take yourself out there and become an actor.' \" In 1995 he joined Shawn for The Wayans Brothers, a TV show that was regarded as a hit only with black audiences. But the Wayanses have their doubts about the picture of the US provided by the Nielsen TV ratings system. \"I don't know any brothers with Nielsen boxes,\" Marlon says. \"I think it's all based on suburban homes,\" adds Shawn. Now there's no arguing with the brothers' success. But Keenen sees no danger of the kind of feuding that often splits show-business families. \"The rifts that most families have are not the results of show business; they're the result of a shaky foundation,\" he says. \"We have a very strong foundation. Show business is not strong enough to divide us.\" \u0095 Scary Movie is released on September 8.",

British officials said the freed members of the Royal Irish Regiment were all in good health and were returning to their base in Benguema, 25 miles east of Freetown. The release came amid controversy after the United Nations accused the captured Britons of running an unauthorised \"Rambo\" mission, and questioned the army's account of the circumstances of their abduction. The captured men are believed to include soldiers with special forces training. They were snatched along with a number of heavy weapons by the West Side Boys, a group of young fighters notorious for their drinking and drug use.

The British military spokesman in Freetown, Lieutenant Commander Tony Cramp, told Sky News: \"Our thoughts and concerns remain with the remaining six, and also the Sierra Leonean army officer who is part of the group which is still being held \"Talks are continuing and we hope for early release of the remainder.\" Lt Cmdr Cramp declined to reveal details of where and how the five were released or whether a deal had been struck with the captors. He said only that British per sonnel were keeping open a \"line of communication\" with representatives of the West Side Boys. The Foreign Office said the five were released with the help of the UN, and specifically the Jordanian contingent of the peacekeeping force. Earlier, the acting UN force commander in Freetown, a Nigerian brigadier-general, Mohammed Garba, said British claims that the soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment were captured while on a routine mission to meet his peacekeepers were untrue. \"The British are giving the wrong account.

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When August began, the American election looked as though it would be about Clinton's trousers. But the month changed everything. Watching it unfold, I saw most parts of Bill Clinton, his inimitable charisma as well as his porous apparel, receding daily from the public mind. The election will be about the future not the past. It's the most important election in the world. It may also turn out to be the best election in the world, restoring stark left-right argument to the politics of a western democracy for the first time since the 80s.</p> <p>At the start, it seemed possible that the voters were getting ready to withdraw from Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president, the forgiveness they'd offered Clinton for the Monica calamity. During that humiliation, the public withheld the loathing which many politicians and commentators, including this one, thought would empty Clinton's remaining two years of all authority. We were wrong. But George W Bush promised Americans he would restore \"dignity and respect\" to the White House. It was the insistent coded mantra he offered the Republican convention. For two weeks, with Gore 12 points behind in the polls, it seemed to be working.</p> <p>This would have been perverse. Was Gore to be trapped between Clinton's incorrigible frailties, on which the people took delayed revenge, and his populistic brilliance, of which the vice president, a leaden speaker and earnest policy-wonk, is in regrettably short supply? The laid-back Bush, reformed alcoholic with distant rumours of cocaine lying unrebutted on the table, had the family connections, the new-leaf repentance, the pleasing manner and the apparent experience stemming from one of the weakest governorships in the US, to take advantage of the personality contest the election might easily become.</p> <p>But already it is different. The personalities will continue to matter, and the body-language is finely watched. Gore hired a ballet dancer to coach him in platform movement. Significant polling gains are attributed to the most lubricious kiss any politician ever gave his wife, uncoached, on a public platform. It's also true that both candidates know their battle is for the centre, both the political and, as it happens, the geographical, the eastern-central and middle-western states. The most startling development as August waned, though, was the clarifying of their differences.</p> <p>The man responsible for this is Al Gore. He needed to change the subject, away from Clinton's aura and Bush's contentless agenda, and did so by the un-American activity of turning sharply to the left. I don't want to exaggerate this. Gore is still locked into funding from corporate America, still mute on inequality, and well outflanked by Ralph Nader running as an independent candidate. But Bush is much more uncomfortable with a turn of events that is forcing him to be specific. \"Dignity and respect\" have almost ceased to matter, as the details of his \"compassionate conservatism\" begin to be ranged against a Gore programme that shows more confidence than Clinton's ever did in the traditional Democrat constituency.</p> <p>Central to Bush's programme is a massive tax cut of $1.3 trillion, geared without discrimination in favour of the rich. Gore promises less than half that, mainly with subsidies to middle-class (working-class is outside the US political vocabulary) families. A projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over 10 years would be used by Gore mainly to cut the debt, by Bush mainly to cut taxes and start privatising social security. But Gore would spend $400bn on health care - insurance for the low-paid, and free drugs for the elderly - Bush a quarter of that. Gore favours a huge federal spend on education: $115bn over the decade, a 50% rise in an area traditionally left to states and localities. Bush, while making education his social priority, wants to rearrange school structures rather than spend anything like that kind of money.</p> <p>Whoever wins, Congress will have the final say in all this. But other differences speak as clearly for a philosophical divide. Bush and Gore would engage with the public and the Senate from starting points quite distant from each other. The most blatant contrast is over environmental protection, where Gore's commitment is as lengthy and knowledgeable as Bush's is Texas-brutish towards any measure making life harder for business, and damn the consequences for global warming. Myriad crucial choices display the same cleavage of attitude. Three seem especially noteworthy. Over gun control, national missile defence and abortion rights, the American voter has to choose between leaders who are absolutists on none of them, but whose preferred biases are heavily divergent.</p> <p>Gore's predicament, in other words, has turned this into an issue-based campaign. He had to do it this way. It conformed to his own wonkish nature, and played to his strengths as a serious politician who has built national experience over 30 years. More pressingly, it was the only escape-route from the trivialities that suited Bush better. It has forced Bush into the open, requiring the sort of performance in which he has so far failed to shine.</p> <p>How, exactly, the issues turn out to be argued is another matter. There's more money available for this year's campaign than for any in recorded history, and most of it will be spent on 30-second TV and radio commercials. That's the idiom that will blanket the airwaves with increasing frenzy for the next two months. America is not a predominantly political country. There is no conversation that could be called national. Many people will have little background against which to measure the roaring assaults.

      "bodyText": "When August began, the American election looked as though it would be about Clinton's trousers. But the month changed everything. Watching it unfold, I saw most parts of Bill Clinton, his inimitable charisma as well as his porous apparel, receding daily from the public mind. The election will be about the future not the past. It's the most important election in the world. It may also turn out to be the best election in the world, restoring stark left-right argument to the politics of a western democracy for the first time since the 80s. At the start, it seemed possible that the voters were getting ready to withdraw from Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president, the forgiveness they'd offered Clinton for the Monica calamity. During that humiliation, the public withheld the loathing which many politicians and commentators, including this one, thought would empty Clinton's remaining two years of all authority. We were wrong. But George W Bush promised Americans he would restore \"dignity and respect\" to the White House. It was the insistent coded mantra he offered the Republican convention. For two weeks, with Gore 12 points behind in the polls, it seemed to be working. This would have been perverse. Was Gore to be trapped between Clinton's incorrigible frailties, on which the people took delayed revenge, and his populistic brilliance, of which the vice president, a leaden speaker and earnest policy-wonk, is in regrettably short supply? The laid-back Bush, reformed alcoholic with distant rumours of cocaine lying unrebutted on the table, had the family connections, the new-leaf repentance, the pleasing manner and the apparent experience stemming from one of the weakest governorships in the US, to take advantage of the personality contest the election might easily become. But already it is different. The personalities will continue to matter, and the body-language is finely watched. Gore hired a ballet dancer to coach him in platform movement. Significant polling gains are attributed to the most lubricious kiss any politician ever gave his wife, uncoached, on a public platform. It's also true that both candidates know their battle is for the centre, both the political and, as it happens, the geographical, the eastern-central and middle-western states. The most startling development as August waned, though, was the clarifying of their differences. The man responsible for this is Al Gore. He needed to change the subject, away from Clinton's aura and Bush's contentless agenda, and did so by the un-American activity of turning sharply to the left. I don't want to exaggerate this. Gore is still locked into funding from corporate America, still mute on inequality, and well outflanked by Ralph Nader running as an independent candidate. But Bush is much more uncomfortable with a turn of events that is forcing him to be specific. \"Dignity and respect\" have almost ceased to matter, as the details of his \"compassionate conservatism\" begin to be ranged against a Gore programme that shows more confidence than Clinton's ever did in the traditional Democrat constituency. Central to Bush's programme is a massive tax cut of $1.3 trillion, geared without discrimination in favour of the rich. Gore promises less than half that, mainly with subsidies to middle-class (working-class is outside the US political vocabulary) families. A projected budget surplus of $4.6 trillion over 10 years would be used by Gore mainly to cut the debt, by Bush mainly to cut taxes and start privatising social security. But Gore would spend $400bn on health care - insurance for the low-paid, and free drugs for the elderly - Bush a quarter of that. Gore favours a huge federal spend on education: $115bn over the decade, a 50% rise in an area traditionally left to states and localities. Bush, while making education his social priority, wants to rearrange school structures rather than spend anything like that kind of money. Whoever wins, Congress will have the final say in all this. But other differences speak as clearly for a philosophical divide. Bush and Gore would engage with the public and the Senate from starting points quite distant from each other. The most blatant contrast is over environmental protection, where Gore's commitment is as lengthy and knowledgeable as Bush's is Texas-brutish towards any measure making life harder for business, and damn the consequences for global warming. Myriad crucial choices display the same cleavage of attitude. Three seem especially noteworthy. Over gun control, national missile defence and abortion rights, the American voter has to choose between leaders who are absolutists on none of them, but whose preferred biases are heavily divergent. Gore's predicament, in other words, has turned this into an issue-based campaign. He had to do it this way. It conformed to his own wonkish nature, and played to his strengths as a serious politician who has built national experience over 30 years. More pressingly, it was the only escape-route from the trivialities that suited Bush better. It has forced Bush into the open, requiring the sort of performance in which he has so far failed to shine. How, exactly, the issues turn out to be argued is another matter. There's more money available for this year's campaign than for any in recorded history, and most of it will be spent on 30-second TV and radio commercials. That's the idiom that will blanket the airwaves with increasing frenzy for the next two months. America is not a predominantly political country. There is no conversation that could be called national. Many people will have little background against which to measure the roaring assaults. Reduced to three sentences, the case for a trillion dollar tax cut may be all too easily misunderstood. We're not talking Socratic dialogue here. Personal viciousness will also be heating up. It's perfectly suited to the insidious soundbite. The pretence that the other guy is sincere, a ritual bow this August to focus-group disgust at \"divisiveness\", will soon explode. But those are commonplace developments: louder and richer than ever, but the usual currency of American politics. What is not usual is a disagreement that can be called ideological.

He gained his Cairo posting as a reward for heading Israel's negotiating team at the original Camp David talks of 1978, and his mere presence in Egypt's capital broke many a taboo between Arabs and the Jewish state. He then represented the Likud party for 15 years in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, before accepting the plum diplomatic assignment of Washington in 1996. In 1998, he became ambassador to France. Domestic Israeli politics had seen him ordered home, but he died within a week, in Paris.</p> <p>Initially, little suggested that Elissar would make an ideal peace-broker. He was a lifelong advocate of extreme rightwing views, derived partly from his own experience as a Holocaust orphan. He condemned the Oslo accords of 1993 as \"the murder of our state\", but dutifully defended Israel's policies overseas.</p> <p>As a teenager, he associated with Lehi - or the \"Stern gang\" - the most violent Jewish underground group in the Palestine of the British Mandate. The new state of Israel was very much a Labour Zionist creation, Lehi was forcibly disbanded, and in 1950 Elissar left the country. Still, the cunning and passion of zealots was not to be squandered. Mossad tracked him down to Paris, where he was studying political science and law at the Sorbonne, and recruited him as their European controller for agents operating in Arab lands.</p> <p>Elissar emerged from the shadows in 1965 to serve as representative for the rightwing Herut/Likud party within the World Zionist Organisation. There he met the dynamic and personable Nitza, whom he married in 1979. By the 70s he had become a confidant of Menachem Begin, Israel's fiery opposition leader. After Likud ousted Labour in 1977, it was Ben Elissar who ran the new prime minister's office. Begin recognised in him a kindred spirit: Polish-born, suspicious and intelligent, scarred by memories of anti-Semitism and genocide; a naturally cautious man, yet willing to act boldly if required.</p> <p>In November 1977, Egypt's President Sadat surprised the world by announcing his intention to visit Jerusalem. Elissar arranged the welcome for him, and suddenly faced a new crisis: finding sheet music for the Egyptian national anthem. A year later in Maryland, he agreed to return the entire Sinai Peninsula to the Arab republic in exchange for lasting peace.</p> <p>Rightwingers were shocked that a Greater Israel devotee could \"abandon\" Jewish settlers in their desert outposts. But Elissar knew better. By jettisoning territory, Israel secured its southern flank from future attack; drove a spoke in the wheel of pan-Arab unity; and deferred more painful sacrifices demanded by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>Life in Cairo tested the ambassador - it was hard to build any rapport after decades of enmity - yet he came to know Egypt's leader well, and wrote admiringly of him in a book, Sadat and his Legacy (1998).</p> <p>Such future diplomatic triumph could scarcely have occurred to the boy born in Radom, central Poland, in 1932. He was just 10 when he arrived in Palestine after being smuggled out of a Nazi-controlled ghetto. His parents and siblings all perished in Europe. Elissar's recollections of the period informed his whole life: \"When an enemy says he is going to kill you, believe him,\" he warned.</p> <p>At the same time, Elissar had all the attributes for diplomatic life. He was charming, discreet, had a history doctorate from Geneva University and spoke several languages. His sartorial elegance, intellectual demeanour and neat square beard made him seem like a reincarnation of Theodor Herzl, the 19th-century founder of political Zionism.</p> <p>After Cairo, Elissar served as a Likud member of the Knesset from 1981 until 1996, and twice chaired the legislature's influential foreign policy and defence committee. When his party returned to power, he accepted the ambassadorship to Washington and moved there in September 1996.</p> <p>At first Elissar was hopeful: \"The USA and Israel don't have to agree on everything, but we will always remain family,\" he said. Unfortunately, he became a pawn in a power struggle between his sponsor, foreign minister David Levy, and his prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. \"Bibi\" undermined him repeatedly, excluding him from meetings with the president and contradicting him.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Elissar assumed his post just as the Jerusalem tunnel crisis was erupting. US-Israeli relations hit a nadir over construction at Har Homa, when the Palestinians were not consulted about the passage excavated at the base of the Temple Mount, and violent protest resulted.

Railtrack's prestigious 21-strong fleet of multipurpose vehicles, which cost \u00a31m each and use high-powered water jets to clear the lines of leaves, has been hit by a technical hitch. This summer the vehicles have been used to rid tracks of fast growing weeds. But the pressure has finally told on them. Brackets on the nozzles of some vehicles have cracked and a race against time has developed to repair them in time for the first leaf fall. Railtrack is therefore even more thankful that its orange and lemon detergent will be on tap to defeat the old enemy. The company pointed out that its fruit brew had several advantages. It was non-corrosive, and did not rot track side cables or signalling. The substance was also environmentally friendly and would not harm vegetation. The firm said that it would concentrate on well known blackspots and promised to work hard on the leaf mould problem this season. \"We really think this is one of our best ideas,\" a spokesman said. One thing is sure. If Railtrack cannot prevent trains from skidding on wet leaves this autumn, it will not be able to blame the wrong type of orange and lemon.",

Sawford, a Swindon warehouse worker, must surrender his passport and report to police at the time of the kick-off of England games, starting with the friendly against France in Paris on Saturday. Civil liberty campaigners have criticised the law as draconian because those suspected of hooliganism can be banned even if they do not have convictions. Potential suspects are identified by football information officers who help build up evidence, which can include CCTV footage and eyewitness reports. But the Home Office said it was pleased that the police and courts were using the new powers, introduced after the government was embarrassed by the scenes of violence involving England fans during Euro 2000 - and encouraged them to continue to do so in advance of Saturday's game. Special courts will be sitting close to ports and main railway stations so that banning orders can be imposed in the run-up to the game, though police have been playing down the chances of trouble. Sawford was one of dozens of England fans arrested by Belgium police at Euro 2000 on June 16 and deported. Magistrates were yesterday told of his history of violence while following England and Swindon Town. He has two convictions, dating back to 1996 and 1998, for threatening behaviour at a football match. Yesterday Sawford was banned from every domestic game in England and Wales and every England match, home or away, for two years. He will have to surrender his passport at least five days before England play abroad and failure to do so will mean up to six months' imprisonment and a fine of up to \u00a35,000.

      "body": "<p>Tens of thousands of British holidaymakers were stranded on both sides of the Channel yesterday as French fishermen blockaded ports in protest at escalating fuel prices.</p> <p>The ports of Calais, St Malo, Dunkirk, Boulogne and Cherbourg were paralysed by the action, which the ferry companies fear will last for at least five days.</p> <p>In Britain, thousands of people were forced to wait throughout the day in the hope of finding alternative routes.</p> <p>Among the worst hit were the 299 passengers on board Brittany Ferries' Bretagne, who, after a journey lasting more than 11 hours, found they were not in their destination of St Malo but back in Portsmouth.</p> <p>The ferry had hoped to beat the blockade, which began in Cherbourg on Tuesday lunchtime, but was forced to turn back after seeing that the Cherbourg peninsula was snarled up.</p> <p>Back in Britain, the passengers were advised to drive 130 miles to Folkestone in Kent to try to cross via Eurotunnel, or wait in the hope of catching a Portsmouth to Caen ferry 12 hours later.</p> <p>The prospect of postponing their holidays by up to 30 hours brought outrage from frustrated holidaymakers. \"We've saved for five years for this holiday and were only going away for 10 days but now we've already lost two days of it,\" said Ellis Viner, 27, a paramedic who awoke believing he was in France. \"It seems ludicrous to get us all the way to France and then turn around.\"</p> <p>Andrew Dutch, 37, from Sheffield, said: \"I've just cycled for two days to get here from Sheffield and I don't want to spend another day cycling to Folkestone to catch the shuttle. But I might have to at this rate.\"</p> <p>Sitting in a deckchair in front of her caravan at the Portsmouth ferry terminal, Pauline Ellis, 54, could barely contain her anger at the indefinite postponement of her French holiday. She said: \"Portsmouth car park is not exactly my idea of the Loire valley.\"</p> <p>The turmoil saw ferry companies scrambling to divert their ships to alternative routes. P&amp;O Stena Line - with 30,000 passengers a day using its Dover to Calais route - replaced its four departures to Calais with one to Zeebrugge; and P&amp;O Portsmouth swapping its five departures to Cherbourg for one to Le Havre.</p> <p>SeaFrance, which had one ferry trapped in Calais harbour and its two others on standby in Dover, cancelled all 30 crossings and offered to pay for its 2,200 passengers to make their way via Eurotunnel.</p> <p>Hoverspeed suspended its Seacat services to Boulogne, though its Dover to Calais route was running.</p> <p>For the 800 people trying to reach St Malo from Poole or Weymouth, via Condor Ferries, there seemed little chance of reaching France swiftly, however: all ferries are to terminate in the Channel Islands, while passengers stranded in St Malo were being advised just to \"sit it out.\"</p> <p>\"If you tell people to go to other ports, you're just passing the problem on,\" explained Nick Dobbs, its marketing manager. \"The problem is, at this time of year - the end of the summer holidays - we have a far greater volume of people trying to get back to Britain than to leave, and if they all go to other ports they'll just face more queues. All we can do is keep them best informed.\"</p> <p>As Kent police turned part of the M20 into a lorry park, and traffic destined for Dover faced 90-minute delays, many of the 48,000 passengers who had been planning to travel on the Dover-Calais route, and the 10,000 from Portsmouth to Cherbourg, were diverted to the Eurotunnel terminals - where an extra train, with room for 170 cars, was laid on each hour.</p> <p>But, with P&amp;O, SeaFrance and Brittany Ferries all having contracts enabling passengers to use the service, there were fears last night that delays could prove excessive.</p> <p>There were also concerns that the problem would escalate if the blockade continued, as the fishermen warned, throughout the weekend. \"Any delays are going to get worse as the week goes on because it's the end of the school holidays and more and more people are coming back,\" said Penny Guy, of P&amp;O Portsmouth. Three times the number of holidaymakers are trying to make their way back to Britain compared to the number leaving for late breaks in France.</p> <p>With this in mind, P&amp;O Stena Line was last night pinning its hopes on gaining an injunction against the blockaders. Awaiting the application - to be heard in a court in Boulogne - Chris Laming, spokesman for P&amp;O Stena, said: \"The rumours circulating around Calais at the moment say that the fishermen are planning to be there for five days. Clearly, it is something we do not want to live with and we are doing all we can.\"</p> <p>But the fishermen - pushing for the untaxed fuel price for fishermen to be cut to 1.20 francs (12p) per litre from 2.10 francs (21p)-remain determined. They are holding a protest march in Paris and plan to meet the fisheries minister, Jean Glavany, today.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of British holidaymakers were stranded on both sides of the Channel yesterday as French fishermen blockaded ports in protest at escalating fuel prices. The ports of Calais, St Malo, Dunkirk, Boulogne and Cherbourg were paralysed by the action, which the ferry companies fear will last for at least five days. In Britain, thousands of people were forced to wait throughout the day in the hope of finding alternative routes. Among the worst hit were the 299 passengers on board Brittany Ferries' Bretagne, who, after a journey lasting more than 11 hours, found they were not in their destination of St Malo but back in Portsmouth. The ferry had hoped to beat the blockade, which began in Cherbourg on Tuesday lunchtime, but was forced to turn back after seeing that the Cherbourg peninsula was snarled up. Back in Britain, the passengers were advised to drive 130 miles to Folkestone in Kent to try to cross via Eurotunnel, or wait in the hope of catching a Portsmouth to Caen ferry 12 hours later. The prospect of postponing their holidays by up to 30 hours brought outrage from frustrated holidaymakers. \"We've saved for five years for this holiday and were only going away for 10 days but now we've already lost two days of it,\" said Ellis Viner, 27, a paramedic who awoke believing he was in France. \"It seems ludicrous to get us all the way to France and then turn around.\" Andrew Dutch, 37, from Sheffield, said: \"I've just cycled for two days to get here from Sheffield and I don't want to spend another day cycling to Folkestone to catch the shuttle. But I might have to at this rate.\" Sitting in a deckchair in front of her caravan at the Portsmouth ferry terminal, Pauline Ellis, 54, could barely contain her anger at the indefinite postponement of her French holiday. She said: \"Portsmouth car park is not exactly my idea of the Loire valley.\" The turmoil saw ferry companies scrambling to divert their ships to alternative routes. P&amp;O Stena Line - with 30,000 passengers a day using its Dover to Calais route - replaced its four departures to Calais with one to Zeebrugge; and P&amp;O Portsmouth swapping its five departures to Cherbourg for one to Le Havre. SeaFrance, which had one ferry trapped in Calais harbour and its two others on standby in Dover, cancelled all 30 crossings and offered to pay for its 2,200 passengers to make their way via Eurotunnel. Hoverspeed suspended its Seacat services to Boulogne, though its Dover to Calais route was running. For the 800 people trying to reach St Malo from Poole or Weymouth, via Condor Ferries, there seemed little chance of reaching France swiftly, however: all ferries are to terminate in the Channel Islands, while passengers stranded in St Malo were being advised just to \"sit it out.\" \"If you tell people to go to other ports, you're just passing the problem on,\" explained Nick Dobbs, its marketing manager. \"The problem is, at this time of year - the end of the summer holidays - we have a far greater volume of people trying to get back to Britain than to leave, and if they all go to other ports they'll just face more queues. All we can do is keep them best informed.\" As Kent police turned part of the M20 into a lorry park, and traffic destined for Dover faced 90-minute delays, many of the 48,000 passengers who had been planning to travel on the Dover-Calais route, and the 10,000 from Portsmouth to Cherbourg, were diverted to the Eurotunnel terminals - where an extra train, with room for 170 cars, was laid on each hour. But, with P&amp;O, SeaFrance and Brittany Ferries all having contracts enabling passengers to use the service, there were fears last night that delays could prove excessive. There were also concerns that the problem would escalate if the blockade continued, as the fishermen warned, throughout the weekend. \"Any delays are going to get worse as the week goes on because it's the end of the school holidays and more and more people are coming back,\" said Penny Guy, of P&amp;O Portsmouth. Three times the number of holidaymakers are trying to make their way back to Britain compared to the number leaving for late breaks in France. With this in mind, P&amp;O Stena Line was last night pinning its hopes on gaining an injunction against the blockaders. Awaiting the application - to be heard in a court in Boulogne - Chris Laming, spokesman for P&amp;O Stena, said: \"The rumours circulating around Calais at the moment say that the fishermen are planning to be there for five days. Clearly, it is something we do not want to live with and we are doing all we can.\" But the fishermen - pushing for the untaxed fuel price for fishermen to be cut to 1.20 francs (12p) per litre from 2.10 francs (21p)-remain determined. They are holding a protest march in Paris and plan to meet the fisheries minister, Jean Glavany, today.",

It was the highest close since June 2, when the index stood at 6,626.4. </p> <p>Trading volume was some 1.4bn shares, higher than dealers expected for the period between bank holidays in Britain and America. However, losers outnumbered gainers by three to two. </p> <p> <strong> CMG</strong>, the Anglo-Dutch computer services company, led the increase for the software sector. The stock rose 157p to \u00a312.85 yesterday after the company issued better than expected first-half profits and issued a positive trading statement. </p> <p>The increase helped other software companies, including <strong> Sema</strong>, which was up 88.5p to \u00a313.11 and <strong> Logica</strong>, which closed 115p higher at \u00a320.46. </p> <p> <strong> Baltimore Technologies</strong>, the computer security firm, initially fell during the day from 770p to a low of 735p as it issued a denial that it is in takeover talks with Microsoft, (such was speculation across the Atlantic earlier this week) but it recovered to close at 779p, or 9p higher. </p> <p>Telecoms were also buoyant throughout the day, as were oil and gas shares. </p> <p> <strong> Vodafone </strong> reached a high of 277.5p before slipping to end 0.25p lower at 272.75p. </p> <p>The initial excitement followed reports of a two-year contract with the government's central purchasing office. </p> <p>Vodafone said that the deal would give it access to more than 100,000 mobile phone users.

      "bodyText": "The ring of so-called TMT stocks (technology, media and telecoms), so familiar during the internet bubble, returned to save the London market yesterday, helping the FTSE 100 index close at a three-month high of 6,615.1. The benchmark indicator added 28.8 points, after rising as much as 40 points during the day. It was the highest close since June 2, when the index stood at 6,626.4. Trading volume was some 1.4bn shares, higher than dealers expected for the period between bank holidays in Britain and America. However, losers outnumbered gainers by three to two. CMG, the Anglo-Dutch computer services company, led the increase for the software sector. The stock rose 157p to \u00a312.85 yesterday after the company issued better than expected first-half profits and issued a positive trading statement. The increase helped other software companies, including Sema, which was up 88.5p to \u00a313.11 and Logica, which closed 115p higher at \u00a320.46. Baltimore Technologies, the computer security firm, initially fell during the day from 770p to a low of 735p as it issued a denial that it is in takeover talks with Microsoft, (such was speculation across the Atlantic earlier this week) but it recovered to close at 779p, or 9p higher. Telecoms were also buoyant throughout the day, as were oil and gas shares. Vodafone reached a high of 277.5p before slipping to end 0.25p lower at 272.75p. The initial excitement followed reports of a two-year contract with the government's central purchasing office. Vodafone said that the deal would give it access to more than 100,000 mobile phone users. The agreement is reported to replace contracts with individual departments and covers everybody from administrators to ministers. BT managed to hold on to its strong gains yesterday, closing up 26p at 852p. Followers pointed to a flurry of bargain hunting by one or two institutions. Redstone Telecom, which provides telecoms to small and medium-sized enterprises, also moved higher yesterday, rising 23p to 220.5p. The company yesterday said it was accelerating the roll-out of its British network and stepping up plans to link with operators in mainland Europe. Bank stocks declined yester day, with Standard Chartered leading the way down. The shares ended 32p lower at 978p. HSBC, however, finished the day up 1p at 982p. Freeserve continued to slide, down more than 5%, or 13p, at 239p, on speculation that it will leave the FTSE 100 at the next quarterly reshuffle. Rolls-Royce, which is also expected to fall out of the lead index on September 9, saw its shares climb 2.5p to 188p, on the back of winning further contracts. Shares in the needleless syringe maker Medisys added 11.5p to 132.5p, following reports that pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson could make a bid. One salesman pointed out that Johnson &amp; Johnson does not usually make hostile bids, adding that Medisys did not appear to be in a mood to sell out. Over on the AIM there were rumours that data storage specialist Intechnology, unchanged at 382.5p yesterday, is preparing a move to a full listing.

      "body": "<p>News that Axa was to unload its stake in US investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette sparked the predictable flurry of rumours about what it would do with the proceeds. Italy's Generali was the name most often mentioned, though some thoughts were directed towards the Spanish insurance market. </p> <p>Axa has come up with a much neater solution. Instead of looking for further geographical expansion, the French insurer is using the proceeds from the sale of the DLJ stake to Credit Suisse to help fund the acquisition of the minority stake in Axa Financial - the 60% owned subsidiary through which Axa held its DLJ stake. As a result US earnings are now likely to be steadier, if occasionally less spectacular. </p> <p>Judging by the immediate share-price reaction Axa's strategy of buying more of what it already had was received with a certain degree of disappointment - a sign these days of the expectations on big European players to do big cross-border deals. </p> <p>In a sense the battle for the London Stock Exchange is an indication of the pressure building up behind pan-European sentiment and the difficulty of actually doing something about it. </p> <p>There is a risk, however, that the pan-European debate is becoming too narrowly focused - UK company X buys Germany company Y or French company A buys Spanish company B. There have been examples of conventional merger and acquisition activity: Vodafone-Mannesmann and France Telecom-Orange spring to mind. But there are other routes, too. The decision of the big telecoms players to splash out billions of pounds on building up pan-European portfolios of third-generation mobile phone licences is an example - albeit it one with a rather limited constituency. </p> <p>Other alternatives are capable of wider application. Take, for example, Commerzbank. Though the German bank has flirted with a domestic merger and been put under pressure to pull off a cross-border merger, its board has generally preferred operational cooperation to corporate consolidation. Next week, if the buzz in Frankfurt is to be believed, it is expected to announced that it is tightening its links with its preferred European partners, Generali and BSCH by issuing shares which will double the size of their holdings to about the 10% level. While part of the thinking behind such a move would clearly be defensive - two friendly shareholders with 20% of the equity would represent a formidable takeover barrier - it should presage closer links at the customer level, too. </p> <p>Others might do well to ponder the virtues of gradualism when it comes to pan-European expansion. An incremental approach may lack the excitement of blockbuster acquisitions but that does not necessarily mean it is ineffectual. </p> <p><strong> Staff costs </strong><br> </p> <p> The scale of a problem in the investment banking industry can usually be judged by the amount of money thrown at it. On that score Credit Suisse is clearly concerned the impact of its acquisition of DLJ on staff there. It is setting aside $1.2bn (\u00a3822m) in retention bonuses for DLJ staff - equivalent to more than 10% of the purchase price. </p> <p>The investment banking industry has seen a number of recent examples where institutions have been forced to pay out heavily to retain key staff at times of merger-inspired change. The evidence is not overwhelming that such tactics work but in a world where dot.coms have come to be seen as a faster route to riches than even Wall Street bonuses banks are reluctant to take the risk. </p> <p><strong> Catch-22 </strong><br> </p> <p> The European Central Bank is facing a no-win situation when it decides today whether or not to raise interest rates and if so by how much. Whatever its decision, the foreign exchange markets will almost certainly give it the thumbs down. If it fails to raise rates the markets will take the view that the bank is all talk when it comes to being tough on inflation. If it raises rates 25 basis points the markets will most likely say it has not done enough but if the ECB takes the bull by the horns and opts for a 50 basis point increase then it will be perceived by many to have overdone the tightening and risks choking off growth in key areas of the euroland economy. </p> <p>The reason the ECB cannot win is that the markets like selling the euro. Just as it was once axiomatic that you never got sacked for selling sterling, so the single currency has become the foreign exchange's favourite target - that has been the way to make money since the euro was launched at the start of last year. </p> <p>Like most of us, foreign exchange traders are reluctant to give up on a good thing. Whatever the ECB decides will be seen as a \"sell the euro\" signal. As at least some of euroland's central bankers are beginning to realise, perceptions about the euro weakness have become firmly entrenched and it will take something seismic to shift them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "News that Axa was to unload its stake in US investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette sparked the predictable flurry of rumours about what it would do with the proceeds. Italy's Generali was the name most often mentioned, though some thoughts were directed towards the Spanish insurance market. Axa has come up with a much neater solution. Instead of looking for further geographical expansion, the French insurer is using the proceeds from the sale of the DLJ stake to Credit Suisse to help fund the acquisition of the minority stake in Axa Financial - the 60% owned subsidiary through which Axa held its DLJ stake. As a result US earnings are now likely to be steadier, if occasionally less spectacular. Judging by the immediate share-price reaction Axa's strategy of buying more of what it already had was received with a certain degree of disappointment - a sign these days of the expectations on big European players to do big cross-border deals. In a sense the battle for the London Stock Exchange is an indication of the pressure building up behind pan-European sentiment and the difficulty of actually doing something about it. There is a risk, however, that the pan-European debate is becoming too narrowly focused - UK company X buys Germany company Y or French company A buys Spanish company B. There have been examples of conventional merger and acquisition activity: Vodafone-Mannesmann and France Telecom-Orange spring to mind. But there are other routes, too. The decision of the big telecoms players to splash out billions of pounds on building up pan-European portfolios of third-generation mobile phone licences is an example - albeit it one with a rather limited constituency. Other alternatives are capable of wider application. Take, for example, Commerzbank. Though the German bank has flirted with a domestic merger and been put under pressure to pull off a cross-border merger, its board has generally preferred operational cooperation to corporate consolidation. Next week, if the buzz in Frankfurt is to be believed, it is expected to announced that it is tightening its links with its preferred European partners, Generali and BSCH by issuing shares which will double the size of their holdings to about the 10% level. While part of the thinking behind such a move would clearly be defensive - two friendly shareholders with 20% of the equity would represent a formidable takeover barrier - it should presage closer links at the customer level, too. Others might do well to ponder the virtues of gradualism when it comes to pan-European expansion. An incremental approach may lack the excitement of blockbuster acquisitions but that does not necessarily mean it is ineffectual. Staff costs The scale of a problem in the investment banking industry can usually be judged by the amount of money thrown at it. On that score Credit Suisse is clearly concerned the impact of its acquisition of DLJ on staff there. It is setting aside $1.2bn (\u00a3822m) in retention bonuses for DLJ staff - equivalent to more than 10% of the purchase price. The investment banking industry has seen a number of recent examples where institutions have been forced to pay out heavily to retain key staff at times of merger-inspired change. The evidence is not overwhelming that such tactics work but in a world where dot.coms have come to be seen as a faster route to riches than even Wall Street bonuses banks are reluctant to take the risk. Catch-22 The European Central Bank is facing a no-win situation when it decides today whether or not to raise interest rates and if so by how much. Whatever its decision, the foreign exchange markets will almost certainly give it the thumbs down. If it fails to raise rates the markets will take the view that the bank is all talk when it comes to being tough on inflation. If it raises rates 25 basis points the markets will most likely say it has not done enough but if the ECB takes the bull by the horns and opts for a 50 basis point increase then it will be perceived by many to have overdone the tightening and risks choking off growth in key areas of the euroland economy. The reason the ECB cannot win is that the markets like selling the euro. Just as it was once axiomatic that you never got sacked for selling sterling, so the single currency has become the foreign exchange's favourite target - that has been the way to make money since the euro was launched at the start of last year. Like most of us, foreign exchange traders are reluctant to give up on a good thing. Whatever the ECB decides will be seen as a \"sell the euro\" signal. As at least some of euroland's central bankers are beginning to realise, perceptions about the euro weakness have become firmly entrenched and it will take something seismic to shift them.",

The deal means that the Rolls-Royce group has secured contracts worth more than \u00a3850m in the past 24 hours with the aerospace arm selling 37 Trent engines to International Lease Finance Corporation. The new engineer tanks will be manufactured by Vickers' plant on Tyneside for completion by 2005.

The orders from the army via the Ministry of Defence are important because they could lead to foreign contracts. They also leave in a more healthy financial state a division which many observers believe Rolls is eager to sell. The tank building division is chasing a large order in Greece and analysts believe that if this is secured there will be a determined attempt to dispose of Vickers. Rolls-Royce is increasingly being focused on its civil and military aerospace, marine and energy divisions. On Tuesday it stole a march on US rivals General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney by winning a \u00a3600m order - the first of its kind - to supply engines for a new generation of super-jumbo jets. The new deals come at a significant time when Rolls-Royce's reputation has taken a battering. The shares plunged after the company reported last week a 76% fall in interim profits partly as a result of problems with its industrial Trent engines. On Tuesday the stock was up 10p at 185p and last night it advanced a further 2.5p to 188p.",

      "bodyText": "Mobile phone rings are about to move to a new pitch of personalisation after a deal between music publisher EMI and Nokia, which allows the Finnish manufacturer's handsets to ring out with users' favourite tunes. Stevie Wonder's I Just Called to Say I Love You has already been nominated by at least one EMI executive to warble from his mobile. However, those with more up to date tastes will be able to choose from a range of artists including Blur, Robbie Williams, the Spice Girls, Puff Daddy and Janet Jackson. Nokia and EMI have an exclusive six-month agreement to launch the product. But both companies are negotiating with other parties to extend the reach. If a favourite band or artist is not published by EMI then the wait should not be too long before mobiles are tinkling Abba's Ring, Ring or Blondie's Hanging on the Telephone. The service should also be available on Motorola and Ericsson handsets in the future. The fee for downloading a favourite song is expected to be well under \u00a31, according to EMI Music Publishing's director of media, Jonathan Channon. Downloading a song to a mobile will be available in the autumn through Club Nokia on the internet or by sending a text message to a phone number to obtain the song. Mr Channon said both companies expect \"tens of millions of downloads\" by 2003. The revenue for Nokia and EMI is put in the scale of \"millions of pounds\" because users are expected to change their call songs frequently. A few companies offer similar services, with Worldpop.com providing a selection of 10 songs favoured by Ibiza fans for use as ring tones on mobile phones. Moloko's Sing it Back has proved very popular.",

      "bodyText": "A \u00a37m advertising campaign reflecting the harrowing situations confronted by police officers was launched yesterday in a bold effort to recruit thousands into the service at a time when overall numbers are at their lowest for a decade. The first of three TV commercials with the theme \"Could you?\" was due to be broadcast during peak viewing time last night, marking the first stage of a three year marketing drive masterminded by the London agency M&amp;C Saatchi. The first advert features the Falklands war veteran Simon Weston. \"People say I'm brave. I've had to deal with a lot in my life,\" he says. \"But to go round to somebody's house to tell a man that his wife and child have been killed by some drunken idiot in a car crash... I'm not sure I could do that.\" The actress Patsy Palmer - who played Bianca Butcher in the BBC soap EastEnders - and the former England footballer John Barnes describe different challenges in two other films. The government is hoping this first national campaign will ease the recruitment crisis facing a service which has been battered by bad publicity in recent years and is suffering from poor morale. Although the Home Office has set aside cash to recruit 9,000 extra officers nationwide over the next three years, the increase will only be meaningful if forces can retain the staff they have. Figures released yesterday showed the number of police officers in England and Wales had dropped from 127,158 in 1997 to 124,418 in March this year. The Metropolitan police has warned if the haemorrhage continues, it will soon have its lowest number of officers on record. M&amp;C Saatchi was set the task of devising a campaign which would lift the spirits of existing officers while encouraging the right calibre of potential recruits in the key 25 to 35 age group. Although the TV ads are hardhitting, the home secretary, Jack Straw, and Paul Whitehouse, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, insisted they were not negative. \"We have to show in an honest way the challenges facing police officers,\" said Mr Whitehouse, who was an adviser to the agency. \"We had to get away from the type of adverts which say 'Join the police and become a chief constable in three weeks' or 'Join and drive a fast car'. If someone is put off policing by the advertisments, then they are probably not the sort of person we need.\" Mr Straw said he asked the agency about the defensive tone of the commercials but was assured they had been well received in sampling, especially by the young. He said the police needed to recruit officers who relied on brain rather than brawn. \"The purpose of our campaign is simple. It is to help local forces attract recruits of the highest quality and expertise over the next three years.\" The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, yesterday said the fall in police numbers was an embarrassment for the government. \"Jack Straw can embark on all the photo opportunities he wants. There is no denying that the thin blue line has got thinner. Jack Straw promised to increase police numbers. He has failed to deliver.\" Fred Broughton, chairman of the Police Federation, welcomed the campaign but said it was only a start. \"More needs to be done to halt the decline in police numbers. We have been calling for extra resources to boost manpower for the last 10 years. But something is at last being done.\" Where low-cost homes make hearts beat faster \"Has Heartbeat started again then?\" said the recruitment office at Newby Wiske hall, where North Yorkshire police are finely tuned to the effects of the nostalgic TV series on weary Metropolitan colleagues' minds. The quiet scrapping of a gentleman's agreement between forces not to poach serving officers from elsewhere has lent a big hand to solving manpower problems for chief constables with rural and low-cost housing beats. North Yorkshire, which includes two national parks and a wealth of villages out of commuter range, has taken on 24 experienced officers from other forces since placing its first advertisement for transfers earlier this year. Another eight are in the pipeline, along with 45 new recruits without previous policing experience. \"It has traditionally been the case that you did not advertise for people to transfer,\" said a spokesman for the North Yorkshire force. \"But the chief constables decided to drop their unwritten agreement and we put an advertisement in a police publication. We have lost two officers transferring out to other forces, but the balance is heavily in our direction.\" The end of the \"no poaching\" agreement this year has started to free the internal market in police manpower, according to the Police Federation, although no change in the law or force regulations has been involved. A spokesman said: \"Officers have always applied for transfers for various reasons, particularly the cost of housing in some parts of the country, but it has not been officially encouraged until now.\" The Association of Chief Police Officers said that the bar on advertising had been \"understood, never written down\", but chief constables had finally decided to end it. Demand for police jobs is not entirely a matter of fine landscapes, with a largely urban force like West Yorkshire receiving 2,000 letters of interest for 60 recently advertised jobs for newrecruits. But North Yorkshire said: \"There definitely is a Heartbeat factor. An awful lot of colleagues from elsewhere want to work on the North York moors.\"",

This means that stricter rules should be introduced for their scientific validation and public sale.\" He hoped the public would become more aware that the effects of herbs, although they might have been used in Asia for centuries, had not been tested in the west in particular in combination with conventional medicines. \"It is a new field but the public has to give it attention and not use these supplements in too large amounts or for too long a period of time.\" The numbers of drugs linked to lung damage was increasing, he said. The Dijon database contained 204 names three years ago. The latest count was 315. There were often no warnings of the damage these medicines could do in the standard drug textbooks doctors consulted because negligible numbers of people suffered from them during the relatively small clinical trials conducted to ascertain whether they are safe and effective. But once they were prescribed widely, significant numbers of people might suffer problems. Lung specialists at the congress said that the side-effects of medicines taken in the past might even be the cause of lung diseases that have them baffled. Doctors were often unable to pin down the precise cause of lung damage. Martin Partridge, chairman of the British Thoracic Society, said Prof Camus was making an important point about the damage that drugs could cause. \"I think the range of medications which can affect the lung make it very difficult for people to be up to date on it.\" Checklist Medicines include: \u0095 Beta-blockers for high blood pressure \u0095 ACE inhibitors for heart failure or high blood pressure \u0095 Cordarone amiodarone for irregular heart rhythms \u0095 Some antibiotics \u0095 Some anti-rheumatics \u0095 Steroids \u0095 Paracetamol \u0095 Drugs derived from ergot given to help brain functions of the elderly or those with Parkinson's disease \u0095 Iodine, used as a radiographic contrast media Damaging side effects: \u0095 Coughs \u0095 Breathlessness \u0095 Pleurisy \u0095 Asthma \u0095 Pneumonia \u0095 Inability to breathe",

Not a country girl at heart, she has always been too fond of strappy sandals and lipgloss for a life among the hills and dales with not a Miss Selfridge for 50 miles. A liking for such things - coupled with a fiery determination to better herself - practically passes for wickedness in Emmerdale. So when she slept with her stepbrother Scott while married to the saintly but simple Roy Glover, there was hell to pay. And hell doesn't take Top Shop storecard. </p> <p>Dumped by Roy on her way to Ibiza, Kelly had no choice but to return home, spangly bikini unworn, Vengaboys CD still in the box. There, she has been shunned by the whole village bar Seth and Betty, who need some excitement in their lives, and Ashley, the ineffectual vicar who wrings his hands so much it passes for tintinnabulation. Like Lola the showgirl, she sits forlorn in the bar with not even her eyebrows for company. Kelly has been a bit overzealous with the tweezers, you understand, leaving them whispers of their former selves, like anorexic caterpillars. </p> <p>Scott has got off lightly, with his mum forgiving him for sleeping with Kelly (\"One's weak, the other's wicked. I can forgive weakness.\") and for that turn he did on Celebrity Stars In Their Eyes as Robbie Williams. All he has suffered is a bit of ribbing (for extra sensation) from Lesbian Frankie, the manic mechanic, and her gay grease-monkey sidekick - a right circus troupe the pair of them. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Ashley's beloved Bernice, all curves and demi-waves (who perhaps has been cryogenically frozen since 1957) went to visit Ashley's potential new - and rather grotty - parish with her mum, the wonderful Diane. \"Few rolls of calico and some nice nets,\" Diane advised. \"Carol Smillie's built a career on less.\" Bernice just smiled in a pained Diana Dors kind of way. Crossroads' Debbie Lancaster was right. \"Men are lucky. They get women. Women just get men.\" </p> <p>According to <strong> Hard Evidence Of Aliens Among Us</strong> (Sky One) - presented by the kind of man who might play an enigmatic business tycoon in an American daytime soap - extra-terrestrials aren't that fussy. They'll abduct anyone they can lay their big spindly hands on and stick probes in every orifice, creating new orifices if needs be. </p> <p>Apparently, 50 per cent of Americans believe in alien abduction and 800,000 maintain they themselves have been abducted, including Jesse Long, who says he has been repeatedly abducted since he was a child. Much hypnosis and faux-horrific reconstructions later, Jesse revealed he is the father of nine human-alien hybrids and that colonisation of Earth by aliens was imminent, just like in The X-Files. </p> <p>In a Kilroy moment, when he was asked what he'd say if he could confront his abductors, Jesse whined \"Why me?\"... which is exactly what I was thinking. One abductee whispered of her kidnappers \"They were tall, they were very thin, with huge eyes.\" So aliens look like Mick Jagger? Maybe Mick Jagger is actually an alien, preparing us for colonisation. </p> <p>With a lump of parmesan the size of Gibraltar, stainless steel accoutrements and random bundles of herbs dotted round Ms Lawson's enormous kitchen, <strong> Nigella Bites</strong> (C4) is either the worst kind of aspirational TV (making you feel guilty you don't make your own sultanas in rum or freeze marinading meat and label the bags) or the best kind (especially if you read Elle Decoration and yearn for a Smeg cooker). </p> <p>While the food wasn't as interesting as having a nosey around Nigella's house, a refreshing lackadaisical attitude infused the programme with her anti-presentation leanings.

Mr Kouchner plans to hold separate local elections within the province a month after Yugoslavia votes in the local, parliamentary and presidential poll. Ms Gajevic's move effectively calls the international community's bluff, for UN resolution 1244 and the technical-military agreement signed in Kumanovo before the pullout of Serb troops in June last year state that Kosovo remains a part of Yugoslavia. However, the return of some Serb forces to the region, as envisaged in the Kumanovo agreement, has not yet happened Many Serbs unofficially admit that Kosovo is lost to Serbia. Even the opposition presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica says that it should stay under UN administration for the time being.

Alan Crozier of the University of Glasgow and four colleagues from three Japanese institutes list the bad qualities of caffeine in a report in the magazine Nature: \"palpitations, gastro-intestinal disturbance, anxiety, tremor, increased blood pressure and insomnia.\" But removing the alkaloid is not only costly, but \"to discerning customers, flavours and aromas are lost\". The scientists have identified and \"cloned\" the gene that makes caffeine in leaves of Camellia sinensis, the source of tea - thus opening the possibility of removing the gene from both the tea plant and from Coffea arabica, the coffee bush. Such a step could even enhance tea's healing benefits - it has ingredients thought to be helpful against heart disease that caffeine may cancel out. Some selected strains of both species are naturally low in caffeine - but a breeding programme to produce a decaffeinated crop would take 20 years. Large scale production of GM tea and coffee plants is more practical, the scientists say, though finding quite how the gene controls natural production of caffeine is still a way off.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore and George W Bush have become locked in an increasingly acrimonious debate about debates, with the two White House contenders jockeying for advantage over the format of their televised confrontations this autumn. In an attempt to break with the traditional televised set-up, the Republican candidate, Mr Bush, is pressing for the debates to have a more informal, round-table character, moderated by hosts who he hopes will adopt a softer, more conversational approach. The Bush camp would like at least one, and possibly more, of the debates to be modelled on a session which took place during the Republican primary race earlier this year, in which the rival contenders were interviewed around a table by CNN's Larry King. Mr Bush said this week that such debates were \"more free flowing\". But the Democrat nominee, Mr Gore, has already accepted a plan put forward by a neutral commission for three debates in October along traditional lines, with the two men standing at lecterns and being grilled by senior political reporters. Mr Gore has also said repeatedly that he will debate with his rival \"any time, anywhere, any place\", though whether he would actually do so is likely to depend on Mr Bush's willingness to agree to the prime-time network events as well. Such debates about debates are not new in American presidential elections, but the Gore-Bush argument has come earlier than usual and reflects the immense stakes which both camps have in the outcome of this year's televised head-to-head sessions. With most of the opinion polls now showing the White House race to be a close one, both men see the debates as one of the few major opportunities to shift voters' minds in the run-up to the November 7 election. As a result, the Gore and Bush camps are both desperate to ensure that their opponent does not get an inbuilt advantage from the way the debates are structured and conducted. Mr Gore's camp believes that its man will outshine Mr Bush in high-profile debates, while Mr Bush's handling of the argument suggests that he fears Mr Gore could be right. At this stage of the campaign the two men only agree on two things - that there will be presidential debates of some description this autumn, and that only Mr Bush and Mr Gore will take part in them. The two main candidates both oppose any efforts by the Reform party's Pat Buchanan or the Green party nominee, Ralph Nader, to be included in the debates. Earlier this year, the independent Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group which has sponsored nationally televised presidential debates in each of the last three American elections, put forward proposals for three debates between the presidential nominees and one debate between the vice-presidential candidates. They would take place between October 3 and 17 and all four would be broadcast by the three major US networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. Mr Gore accepted the commission's proposals this week and also agreed to a suggestion from the Bush camp for a second televised match-up between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman, the vice- presidential nominees. Mr Bush's reluctance to make the same commitment prompted a barrage of attacks from the Gore camp. \"George Bush is trying to do everything he can to avoid prime-time presidential debates that will be seen on all three networks,\" a spokesman Mark Fabiani said. Such attacks riled Mr Bush. \"Who said we don't want prime-time exposure?\" he retorted at a meeting with reporters on his campaign plane. Mr Bush said he would \"pick and choose\" the venues, formats and ground rules for the debates.",

      "bodyText": "Anglers and environment agency staff were yesterday in despair after the 14th big river pollution incident in the last month spilled 50,000 gallons of toxic farm slurry into the river Dart in Devon. Teams of environment agency staff spent more than 24 hours trying to contain the pollution near Tiverton when it threatened to enter the Exe, one of Britain's most important salmon rivers. Last night they reported that they had largely succeeded in controlling the pollution and prevented it entering the Exe. This involved the environment agency and South West Water pumping hydrogen peroxide into the river to raise the oxygen levels, pumping the worst of the polluted water on to nearby fields and increasing the flow of the Exe. Hundreds of fish are known to have died but the full extent of the pollution has yet to be established. The source has been traced to a slurry store on a local farm but it is too early to say what the full environmental effects may be. Work is now under way to remove more slurry found on a nearby hillside, which could run into the Dart if it rains. Martin Weiler, of the environment agency, said it was a \"major incident\". \"We will be carrying out a full investigation with a view to a possible prosecution.\" The last five weeks have been some of the worst on recent record for river and canal pollution incidents. Up to 250,000 fish have been killed in 14 incidents on British waterways around the country. The worst incident is thought to have been on the river Dee near Chester when an unknown chemical polluted up to 20 miles of water killing approximately 100,000 fish. Agency staff are still investigating the incident. Other incidents this year have been on the river Smite in Nottinghamshire and the Trent and Mersey canal, near Stone in Staffordshire. Last week, up to 1,000 protected crayfish were wiped out along a stretch of a Cumbrian river polluted with sheep dip. The chemical which caused the pollution is believed to be a synthetic pyrethroid, extremely toxic to aquatic insects, with small quanitites able to contaminate large amounts of water. Yesterday the environment agency, which is still investigating many of the incidents, suggested that most of the pollution was due to carelessness rather than deliberate releases. \"It's been a really bad month. There is so much negligence. Part of the problem is that the penalties for polluting the environment are risible. Polluters say, 'What's a few hundred pounds?',\" said a spokesman. Earlier this year a Nottinghamshire farmer was fined \u00a31,000 with \u00a3450 costs for killing 44,000 fish. Average fines in 1999, say the agency, were about \u00a33,500 for major incidents which might destroy a riverine habitat for years. The National Federation of Anglers, which has 230,000 members, was dismayed at the incidents, especially because British waterways are generally less polluted than in the past. \"It's been a disastrous year for fish kills,\" said Rodney Coldron of the federation. \"It can take up to 10 years for rivers to recover from pollution incidents like these. \"Magistrates and judges must understand this is very serious.\"",

Police and rescue workers said another 42 people were severely shaken by the accident, which happened during the lunchtime rush hour at the Notre-Dame-de-Lorette station in the north of the city. \"There was a horrible noise on the bend just before the train arrived at the station,\" said Peter Marsh, a British tourist in the derailed train who escaped with only a few bruises. \"Then the lights went out, and the train began to gather speed before the front carriage left the tracks. The carriage began to fill with smoke and a burning smell. It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying.\" Evangelos Tzonis, a French resident of Greek origin who was in the front carriage of the stationary train, said he was looking through the driver's window when he saw the first carriage of the approaching train turn on to its side and career towards him. \"The noise was indescribable in the tunnel, like an earthquake,\" he said. \"I really thought we were all going to die.

Some 170 police and rescue workers sealed off the station within minutes of the accident, the first of its kind in living memory on the Paris underground, which carries 4.4m passengers a day.

The widow of their victim, Mozambique-born Alberto Adriano, stayed away from the hearing at a court in the eastern city of Halle after receiving a death threat. The court sentenced Enrico Hilprecht, 24, to the maximum of life in prison. His two 16-year-old co-defendants, Christian Richter and Frank Miethbauer, were each given nine years in jail, one year less than the maximum sentence for juveniles. The judge called the deadly assault on June 11 \"the latest in a long chain of attacks to which we must put an end\". Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, called yesterday for the speedy imposition of a ban on the radical far-right National Democratic party of Germany (NPD). The government has moved gradually towards supporting a ban, despite the misgivings of its interior minister, Otto Schily. Critics, including senior officials in the counter-intelligence service, have argued that such a ban would merely make surveillance of the neo-Nazi scene more difficult. Mr Schr\u00f6der will today lay a wreath at a memorial erected at the spot where Adriano was attacked so savagely that he later died of his wounds. The killing was the third this year alleged to have been carried out by members of the far right. The court was told that the younger defendants had previous convictions for daubing swastikas. Tolerance of neo-Nazi violence is widespread in eastern Germany, especially among the young. In an effort to end this tolerance, the chancellor yesterday appealed to east Germans' pride in their recent history, encouraging them to take a stand like the one that put an end to communist rule in 1989. He said Germany needed a \"repeat of what people in the east of our country recognised in the peaceful revolution 10 years ago\", adding that the easterners had to \"involve themselves and fight for the right thing\". In Dessau, where Adriano was killed, police said his German-born widow had received a threatening letter which the public prosecutor's office was investigating. A spokesman for a foreigners' rights group said she had decided not to attend the final session of the court because she was \"simply too scared because of her children\". Mr Adriano, who was 39 and worked in a meat packing plant, left behind him three children, of whom the youngest is six months old. His killers yesterday sat expressionless in court yesterday as the verdict was read out. The defence had pleaded for shorter jail terms and for manslaughter or deadly assault charges, saying prosecutors had failed to prove that the attackers intended to kill Adriano when they set on him in a park after a drunken rampage through the city. A defence lawyer, Sabine Grunow, said all of the accused expressed regret in brief closing statements at the end of the four-day trial. Hearings were closed to the public because of German law regarding juveniles. Adriano was walking home in the early hours of the morning, when the three attacked him, screaming racist abuse. When they had kicked him unconscious, they stripped him of his clothes as a final humiliation. In a further instance of racist violence, prosecutors in the northern town of L\u00fcbeck said they had arrested two skinheads for attacking and injuring a 33-year-old African man whom they had taunted with racial slurs. Police in the German town of Waiblingen detained two men after two foreigners were slightly injured in an early-morning arson attack on a home for asylum seekers. Late on Tuesday, a 21-year-old German man was given a five-month suspended sentence and fined 500DM (\u00a3160) for punching a Hong Kong-born photojournalist who was trying to cover racism in the east.",

The controls were rushed through despite opposition from the European ombudsman, Jacob Soderman, who warned this week that the code could be applied to policy areas presently open to public scrutiny. When Tony Bunyan, editor of Statewatch, the British-based civil liberties bulletin, asked in July for details of the Solana plan, he was told by a senior EU council official that the release of such information \"could fuel public discussion on this subject\". Under the Solana plan, all classified documents relating to \"security and defence of the union or one or more of its member states\", or to \"military or non-military crisis management\", will be permanently excluded from public scrutiny. The blanket secrecy rules will cover proposals to set up a 5,000-strong EU paramilitary police force as well as plans for a rapid reaction force. They could cover all EU discussions on criminal justice, border controls and trade policy. The code will also enable Nato and non-EU governments to veto the disclosure of EU documents. Documents passed to State watch show that the plans go much much further than purely military operations. The commission says the proposed rapid reaction force could be used to quell \"growing violence destabilising law and order, breaches of the peace, outbreaks of fighting, armed conflicts\" and \"massive population movements\". Documents which would have been suppressed under the new controls include minutes of a meeting of paramilitary police from Spain, Portugal, France and Italy in January at which they discussed the creation of a \"European security and investigation force\" as a \"tool\" at the disposal of the EU and Nato. Paramilitary police forces, they say, are particularly qualified for the \"restoration of public security\", providing capabilities for \"intelligence, general surveillance, judicial police [and] maintaining order\".",

      "bodyText": "An editing error left Ian Aitken's column (page 21, August 29) saying that RA Butler \"could easily have been prime minister instead of Harold Macmillan\". It should have said: \"instead of Alec Douglas-Home\". Stories on the retirement of George Carman QC on page 1 and on pages 2-3 of G2 yesterday mistook the date of the collapse of Jonathan Aitken's libel suit against the Guardian. It was June 1997. A feature yesterday on Chelsea Clinton (Page 16, G2) referred throughout to her present US university as Stamford. It is Stanford. A survey of modern literature in German, page 10, August 26, harked back to Kafka as \"Czech-born\". Franz Kafka was born in 1883 in Prague, part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. A column on page 5, G2, August 23, was wide of the mark in calling Anna Kournikova a poor performer on court. She ranks 14th in the world. \"She has nevertheless made more money than any other female tennis player, banking \u00a37.5m,\" it went on. To clarify: the reference was not to all-time women's earnings, but to the best estimates for 1999 by Ace magazine, published by a Lawn Tennis Association subsidiary. There Kournikova tops Martina Hingis (\u00a37m) and Monica Seles (\u00a34.8m). A Travel book review, page 11, August 26, said flying from Britain to Sydney took 14 hours. More than 20 is usual. A Proms review, page 20, August 29, said that the Hymnus was written by Julius Klengel in 1972 for the Twelve Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic. What it meant to say was that the group was formed in 1972 to perform this work (Klengel died in 1933). In a piece yesterday on the importance of spelling, page 4, G2, the date of Dan Quayle's \"potatoe\" mistake should have been 1992, not 1982.

      "body": "<p>Many museums are in crisis (How death by a thousand cuts is destroying Britain's heritage, August 29) and yet they have never been more popular with visitors. This paradox results from the bizarre way in which museums are funded by local councils and the move to unitary authorities.</p> <p>Collaborative county-wide museum services have been dismantled and the authorities have come under immense pressure to reduce expenditure in a way that has had a disproportionate effect on cultural budgets.</p> <p>It is ironic that this is happening at a time when the value of museums for education, for social inclusion, as agents of regeneration and as resources of knowledge are recognised in government reports. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the devolved administrations are providing strong support for museums at a national level. The Museums Association is calling for a high-level review of the future funding of non-national museums. The damage that is already occurring is serious and there seems no immediate prospect of improvement.</p> <p><b>Dr J Patrick Greene</b><br> Museums Association <a href=\"mailto:greene@mussci.u-net.com\"> greene@mussci.u-net.com</a><br></p> <p>\u0095 The basic reason for the crisis is that venues are assessed more on their visitor numbers than on the importance of the collections. The \"numbers game\" has been the most important factor in funding for 20 years. We are now reaping the harvest of this short-term view. The public can find more interesting things to do than go to a museum, largely because they are unaware of the interest to and benefits for children. The inability to observe and concentrate in our screen-based culture is increasingly evident.</p> <p>Marketing is helpful if done well, but can I suggest two other strategies. Subsidise school trips, as the children of today are the museum visitors of tomorrow - many schools simply can't afford the transport or extra carers needed. And change Treasury rules to allow revenue funding.

      "bodyText": "Many museums are in crisis (How death by a thousand cuts is destroying Britain's heritage, August 29) and yet they have never been more popular with visitors. This paradox results from the bizarre way in which museums are funded by local councils and the move to unitary authorities. Collaborative county-wide museum services have been dismantled and the authorities have come under immense pressure to reduce expenditure in a way that has had a disproportionate effect on cultural budgets. It is ironic that this is happening at a time when the value of museums for education, for social inclusion, as agents of regeneration and as resources of knowledge are recognised in government reports. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the devolved administrations are providing strong support for museums at a national level. The Museums Association is calling for a high-level review of the future funding of non-national museums. The damage that is already occurring is serious and there seems no immediate prospect of improvement. Dr J Patrick Greene Museums Association greene@mussci.u-net.com \u0095 The basic reason for the crisis is that venues are assessed more on their visitor numbers than on the importance of the collections. The \"numbers game\" has been the most important factor in funding for 20 years. We are now reaping the harvest of this short-term view. The public can find more interesting things to do than go to a museum, largely because they are unaware of the interest to and benefits for children. The inability to observe and concentrate in our screen-based culture is increasingly evident. Marketing is helpful if done well, but can I suggest two other strategies. Subsidise school trips, as the children of today are the museum visitors of tomorrow - many schools simply can't afford the transport or extra carers needed. And change Treasury rules to allow revenue funding. It makes no sense to give massive capital grants and then abandon a venue to the vagaries of the marketplace. Stanley Graham Barnoldswick, Lancs \u0095 Maev Kennedy shows that museums, like archives and libraries, play a vital social and educational role for people of all ages.

His subsequent work as an arranger, composer and pianist took him into significant collaborations with the Rolling Stones, Sonny and Cher, Neil Young and many others, and eventually into the world of film scoring, where he produced the soundtracks for Performance, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The Exorcist, An Officer and a Gentleman, and 9&amp;1/2 Weeks.</p> <p>Having started life as a musical hack in an age of comparative innocence, Nitzsche ended it in the Queen of Angels Hospital, Hollywood. He died from cardiac arrest brought on by a recurrent bronchial infection, aged 63 - as one of pop's most influential backroom figures, a pioneer who found a way of exploiting what was, for the time, an unusually eclectic musical taste.</p> <p>Born in Chicago but raised on a farm outside Newaygo, Michigan, Nitzsche moved to Los Angeles in 1955, aged 18, with the ambition of becoming a jazz saxophonist. But the burgeoning Hollywood pop scene soon attracted his attention, and Sonny Bono, then an A&amp;R man for the Specialty label, gave him his first job, as a music copyist. Nitzsche soon exceeded his initial brief by writing a novelty hit, Bongo Bongo Bongo, for Preston Epps, a session percussionist.</p> <p>Nitzsche encountered Phil Spector in 1961 while working in the Hollywood office of Lee Hazlewood, the producer of Duane Eddy's twangy guitar hits (and later Nancy Sinatra's musical partner). The following summer, Spector, still barely 20 years old, invited Nitzsche to create the orchestration for a Gene Pitney song called He's a Rebel, to be recorded by the Crystals. With the session singer Darlene Love taking the place of the Crystals' own lead singer, Barbara Alston, the session provided the template for Spector's much imitated sound.</p> <p>Not particularly keen to share the credit for his creations, Spector was dismissive of the contribution of his arrangers. \"I know how to arrange,\" he once told me, \"but it's much easier to have someone to write it out than to have to sit down and do it yourself.\" Yet the orchestrations were the key to what Spector called his \"little symphonies for the kids\", and Nitzsche's skill was important to the success of songs such as the Crystals' Da Doo Ron Ron and Then He Kissed Me, and the Ronettes's Be My Baby, Baby I Love You and Walking in the Rain, for which the producer habitually assembled an instrumental line-up including platoons of guitarists, pianists, bassists and drummers, and then drilled his jazz-trained musicians on simple three-chord patterns until their fingers bled.</p> <p>Spector was willing to concede Nitzsche's competence. \"He was really good and co-operative and I always used him,\" he said. But when Spector signed up the Righteous Brothers in 1964 and prepared to record a song called You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin', Nitzsche was busy with another project, and the job of creating the arrangement for the 60s' greatest example of orchestral pop went instead to Gene Page. \"I guess Jack felt really unimportant when he saw that we could do it without him, that it could be any arranger,\" Spector said. \"It was his own fault, because he was gone.\"</p> <p>He was back, however, in time to participate in River Deep, Mountain High, featuring the voice of Tina Turner, which gave Spector a big hit in Britain, but failed dismally in the United States, sending the temperamental producer into resentful seclusion.</p> <p>Nitzsche had already moved on. Under his own name, a charming if ephemeral instrumental titled The Lonely Surfer became a hit. He hung out with the Rolling Stones, and played piano on a number of their hits, including 19th Nervous Breakdown and Paint It Black. With Sonny Bono, he wrote Needles and Pins, a worldwide hit for the Searchers. In 1966 he arranged Bob Lind's Elusive Butterfly and Buffalo Springfield's Expecting To Fly, the latter inaugurating a long collaboration with Neil Young which included studio work on the Canadian's first solo album and, as a pianist, on tour with Young's band, Crazy Horse. And in 1970, for Donald Cammell and Nic Roeg, he created the music for Performance, featuring Mick Jagger, Ry Cooder and Randy Newman, after which his expertise with soundtracks was much in demand, culminating in the daring and successful teaming of John Lee Hooker and Miles Davis for The Hot Spot, Dennis Hopper's noir thriller, in 1991.</p> <p>Nitzsche was first married to a session singer, Gracia Ann May, but it was with his second wife, the folk singer Buffy Sainte Marie, and the jobbing lyricist Will Jennings that he co-authored Up Where We Belong, the theme song to Taylor Hackford's An Officer and a Gentleman, a worldwide hit for Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes, and the winner of an Academy Award for best song in 1982.</p> <p>Nitzsche's life was not a smooth one.

When can we have a proper debate on drugs use and production here and abroad ?</p> <p><b> Dr Jenny Tongue MP</b><br> Lib Dem International development spokesman</p> <p>\u0095 The drug war effectively fuels crime, while failing miserably at protecting children from drugs. Because drug dealers don't ID for age, children have an easier time buying cannabis than beer. The single most effective means of destroying the international drug trade is the legalisation of cannabis for adults. To maintain criminal sanctions for a plant that is arguably safer than alcohol puts children at risk. While there is nothing inherent in cannabis that compels users to try harder drugs, its black market status puts users in contact with criminals who push them. Current drug policy is effectively a gateway policy.</p> <p>The Netherlands closed this gateway by separating the hard and soft drug markets. Yet the US Drug Enforcement Administration has a long history of criticising the Netherlands, despite the fact that the Netherlands has substantially lower rates of drug use than the United States. It is obvious that the DEA is far more concerned with maintaining job security than minimising drug abuse.</p> <p><b>Robert Sharpe</b><br> Students for Sensible Drug Policy<br> George Washington University, Washington DC</p>",

Dr Jenny Tongue MP Lib Dem International development spokesman \u0095 The drug war effectively fuels crime, while failing miserably at protecting children from drugs. Because drug dealers don't ID for age, children have an easier time buying cannabis than beer. The single most effective means of destroying the international drug trade is the legalisation of cannabis for adults. To maintain criminal sanctions for a plant that is arguably safer than alcohol puts children at risk. While there is nothing inherent in cannabis that compels users to try harder drugs, its black market status puts users in contact with criminals who push them. Current drug policy is effectively a gateway policy. The Netherlands closed this gateway by separating the hard and soft drug markets. Yet the US Drug Enforcement Administration has a long history of criticising the Netherlands, despite the fact that the Netherlands has substantially lower rates of drug use than the United States. It is obvious that the DEA is far more concerned with maintaining job security than minimising drug abuse.

      "bodyText": "President Bill Clinton flew into Colombia yesterday amid a countrywide outbreak of rebel violence and protests against a massive boost in US military aid to the government. Leftwing guerrillas attacked police stations and army posts, bombs exploded outside banks and masked students clashed with riot police. The violence took place mostly around the three main cities and in rural areas hundreds of miles from Cartagena, the Caribbean tourist resort where 5,000 troops, 350 US agents, helicopter gunships and an American aircraft carrier provided security for Mr Clinton's nine-hour visit. On Tuesday night, rebels attacked 12 police stations in six of the country's 32 departments. Five civilians, including two children, died when guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) rained mortar bombs on a police station in the village of La Bateca, near the border with Venezuela. In south-west Cali, the second largest city, Farc guerrillas detonated bombs outside three banks, causing widespread damage but no injuries, police said. In the north-eastern oil- producing province of Arauca, another Farc unit attacked an army barracks near the town of Fortul on Tuesday afternoon, injuring six soldiers, an army spokeswoman said. Guerrillas also attacked an army post in the nearby town of Saravena. US-made Blackhawk helicopters flew to the region to strike back at the rebel column. Rebel commanders have denounced the US aid package, which includes 60 helicopters, equipment and training for the Colombian army, saying that money will cause an escalation in the civil war, and eventually US-backed military action against the guerrillas. \"Clinton isn't here to support social investment but a military plan. We don't want to make threats, but the Colombian people have the rights to take to the streets and protest against this visit,\" the Farc commander, Andres Paris, told the Guardian. In a videotaped address to the Colombian people broadcast on Tuesday night, Mr Clinton stressed the social development programmes included in the aid package, and denied that Washington planned military intervention. \"We have no military objective. We do not believe your conflict has a military solution. We support the peace process. Our approach is both pro-peace and anti-drug,\" Mr Clinton said. Yesterday the Miami Herald reported that the Pentagon is planning to send an army general to oversee the military element of the aid package. According to US law, a maximum of 500 American troops and 300 civilian contractors may be in Colombia at any time, but the president may waive the limit in the event of an \"imminent involvement\" of US forces in hostilities. The largest chunk of American money will pay for 60 helicopters to support a military offensive in the rebel-dominated jungles of southern Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is produced. The helicopters and three US-trained anti-narcotics army battalions will lead the advance, securing control of drug plantations to allow the police to eradicate illegal crops. Mr Clinton waived strict human rights conditions to approve the aid last week, despite fears that the Colombian military maintains close ties with illegal rightwing paramilitary groups. In its 1999 report, the state department reported \"credible allegations of co-operation with paramiltary groups, including both silent support and direct collaboration.\" Monitoring groups in Colombia fear that the American money will exacerbate the country's 35-year civil war and cause up to 200,000 people to flee their homes.

HMS Perseus lay on the seabed, some two miles offshore, its hull sliced open by an Italian mine, a watery grave for Capes's 59 fellow crewmen. Fortified by a bottle of rum, the submariner - a giant of a man known as \"Choppa\" to his friends - had wriggled through a hatch and surfaced from 52 metres (170ft). He then swam for hours to reach the Italian-occupied island. \"He was exhausted, wearing his oxygen device, a Davis submerged escape apparatus, and practically nothing else,\" says Kostas Thoctarides, the Greek diver who found the vessel on Christmas Day 1997. Now, 59 years after the sinking, Cephalonia is going out of its way to mark the tragedy. A monument to Perseus's crew was recently unveiled on one side of the island while on the other, a marble plinth to honour the locals who risked their lives to conceal Leading Stoker Capes for nearly 18 months before he was smuggled to safety in neutral Turkey. And a moving memorial service, attended by the lost submariners' relatives, was held at sea where the unusually intact vessel now lies on its starboard side. \"It's such an incredible story,\" enthuses Spyros Moskopoulos, the island's vice-prefect. \"There's even talk of a Hollywood-style movie by the same company that's filming Captain Corelli's Mandolin here.\" But as Captain Corelli's British creator, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, has bitterly discovered, interpreting the island's turbulent recent past can be a minefield in itself.

      "body": "<p>The largest edible crabs in the world, growing to one and a half metres across, have invaded northern Norway from Russia and spawned a new and valuable fishing industry.</p> <p>King crabs as they are known, hundreds of thousands of them, are marching west along the Barents Sea and heading south towards the rest of Europe.</p> <p>To the fishermen of northern Norway they are both a boon and a menace. The bonus comes because they are worth \u00a3150 each at Oslo fishmongers. The problem is that there are so many juvenile crabs - too small to eat - that hundreds of them are caught at a time and they weigh down and break the nets of trawlers. Often cod fishermen catch more crabs than fish.</p> <p>The crabs originally came from the Kamchatka peninsula on the extreme eastern side of Russia, in cold Arctic waters. In an experiment in the 1960s a Russian scientist, without consulting the Norwegians, introduced them into a fjord in the Barents Sea. The area is so cold that there are no native crabs there, but the king crabs found it a home from home and thrived.</p> <p>The first the Norwegians knew about them was in 1980, when a few were caught in cod nets. A huge colony has now established itself in Varanger fjord, the biggest in Norway, which is renowned for its cod and haddock. The crabs there regularly reach 1.5 metres (five feet) across - bigger than in their native waters in Asia.</p> <p>The crabs have already marched 600 miles (1,000 kilometres) west of Varanger, round the coast to Tromso, and have now turned south.</p> <p>The Russians and Norwegians, who share all fish catches in the Barents Sea, realise that they have a new resource with valuable export potential to Japan and the US, and are being careful not to over-exploit it.</p> <p>Russia and Norway have limited their catch this year to 37,500 king crabs each, but next year, as the numbers continue to balloon, it will be larger. The Japanese are already so keen on the new fishery that they are flying special teams over to buy up the pick of the catch.</p> <p>Runar Hartvigsen, regional director of fisheries and aquaculture for Finnmark, said: \"This is very good news for us. Research so far shows that the king crab has occupied a niche that no other species uses, and so there is plenty of food for them but no harm done.</p> <p>\"The only problem is that there are so many of them, and they weigh so much, they can break the nets of our other fishermen.</p> <p>\"There is no way we can control the crabs' advance or their numbers; what we have to do is make the most of the business opportunity they offer.\"</p> <p>He said that Japanese teams had already flown to Norway to investigate the fishery and planned to be there from October to January, buying the better flavoured male crabs and flying them back live to the Tokyo fish market.</p> <p>Fishermen currently get \u00a34 a kilogram (2.2lb) for the crabs at the quayside, but the retail price in Oslo is \u00a330 a kilo. The legs are so big they are broken off, cooked in their shells and sold in restaurants as \"crab sausages\". \"They taste superb, a mixture between prawn and lobster,\" he said.</p> <p>The Norwegians are now experimenting with farming the crabs, anticipating potential markets in the EU.</p> <p>Using medium-sized male king crabs about five years old, caught in fishing nets in March, the crab farmers are keeping them in enclosures on the sea bed and feeding them until the harvesting season begins in October. During that time the crabs will shed their outer shells and, in the two months before the new shell hardens, they will grow by 25% in size and weight.</p> <p>\"This means a four kilo crab in March is five kilos in the autumn, adding \u00a320 to its value and making farming a viable proposition,\" Mr Hartvigsen said.</p> <p>So far there appears to be no limit to the crabs' advance and scientists believe that they may reach as far south as Bergen in 10 years. By then Mr Hartvigsen believes, even the mighty king crab may slow down.</p> <p>\"The water south of Bergen is warmer. The king crab likes to be really cold, so it may stop advancing further south. But the fact is we do not really know until it gets there.\"</p>",

The problem is that there are so many juvenile crabs - too small to eat - that hundreds of them are caught at a time and they weigh down and break the nets of trawlers. Often cod fishermen catch more crabs than fish. The crabs originally came from the Kamchatka peninsula on the extreme eastern side of Russia, in cold Arctic waters. In an experiment in the 1960s a Russian scientist, without consulting the Norwegians, introduced them into a fjord in the Barents Sea. The area is so cold that there are no native crabs there, but the king crabs found it a home from home and thrived. The first the Norwegians knew about them was in 1980, when a few were caught in cod nets. A huge colony has now established itself in Varanger fjord, the biggest in Norway, which is renowned for its cod and haddock. The crabs there regularly reach 1.5 metres (five feet) across - bigger than in their native waters in Asia. The crabs have already marched 600 miles (1,000 kilometres) west of Varanger, round the coast to Tromso, and have now turned south. The Russians and Norwegians, who share all fish catches in the Barents Sea, realise that they have a new resource with valuable export potential to Japan and the US, and are being careful not to over-exploit it. Russia and Norway have limited their catch this year to 37,500 king crabs each, but next year, as the numbers continue to balloon, it will be larger. The Japanese are already so keen on the new fishery that they are flying special teams over to buy up the pick of the catch. Runar Hartvigsen, regional director of fisheries and aquaculture for Finnmark, said: \"This is very good news for us. Research so far shows that the king crab has occupied a niche that no other species uses, and so there is plenty of food for them but no harm done. \"The only problem is that there are so many of them, and they weigh so much, they can break the nets of our other fishermen. \"There is no way we can control the crabs' advance or their numbers; what we have to do is make the most of the business opportunity they offer.\" He said that Japanese teams had already flown to Norway to investigate the fishery and planned to be there from October to January, buying the better flavoured male crabs and flying them back live to the Tokyo fish market. Fishermen currently get \u00a34 a kilogram (2.2lb) for the crabs at the quayside, but the retail price in Oslo is \u00a330 a kilo. The legs are so big they are broken off, cooked in their shells and sold in restaurants as \"crab sausages\". \"They taste superb, a mixture between prawn and lobster,\" he said. The Norwegians are now experimenting with farming the crabs, anticipating potential markets in the EU. Using medium-sized male king crabs about five years old, caught in fishing nets in March, the crab farmers are keeping them in enclosures on the sea bed and feeding them until the harvesting season begins in October. During that time the crabs will shed their outer shells and, in the two months before the new shell hardens, they will grow by 25% in size and weight. \"This means a four kilo crab in March is five kilos in the autumn, adding \u00a320 to its value and making farming a viable proposition,\" Mr Hartvigsen said. So far there appears to be no limit to the crabs' advance and scientists believe that they may reach as far south as Bergen in 10 years. By then Mr Hartvigsen believes, even the mighty king crab may slow down. \"The water south of Bergen is warmer. The king crab likes to be really cold, so it may stop advancing further south. But the fact is we do not really know until it gets there.\"",

He was forced to help bury British fellow soldiers two deep, without crosses or identity discs, in a trench that stretched across a French field farther than his eye could see. Their families were never told what killed them. They were a small part of an estimated 20,000 British troops who died not from bullets or shrapnel but from starvation and disease in German prisoner of war camps during the first world war. The estimate, which is close to one known to civil servants soon after the war ended in 1918 but unpublished for 70 years, is nearly double the officially announced figure.

      "bodyText": "Sadler's Wells, rebuilt with \u00a336m of lottery money, could face ruin if it loses a legal battle with its builders, it was disclosed yesterday. The London dance theatre is suing its main contractor, Bovis, claiming it was overcharged for the work. The building reopened in October 1998. Sadler's Wells is also in dispute with its electrical contractor, Goodmariott &amp; Hursthouse. Any crisis now would come as an embarrassment to Chris Smith, the culture secretary and a dance fan, who has backed the theatre's efforts to bring dance to a wide audience at knock down prices. But the management denied reports that it was on the brink of bankruptcy. Ian Albery, chief executive, said it had record advance bookings after a year that had seen sell-out runs for Pina Bausch and Netherlands Dance Theatre, and an unexpected hit with a dance piece based on the life of Elvis called The King. \"In the current financial year Sadler's Wells is on budget, with attendances forecast to be over 400,000,\" he said. Reports of a financial crisis were sparked when routine Arts Council inquiries into the viability of the two high court actions leaked out. But yesterday an Arts Council spokesman said: \"There was never any implication that Sadler's Wells is insolvent or is likely to be so... There are claims between Sadler's Wells and their contractors, which are all too common across the construction industry.\" He said the Arts Council fully expected Sadler's Wells to win both its cases, but admitted that if it lost both it would be in a \"disastrous situation\". Mr Albery said no public money was being used for the litigation and that the \"public interest requires that moneys are recovered from those responsible for the overspending\" on the rebuilding.",

      "body": "<p>The two men with toolboxes did not look convinced, but they were willing to give the idea a go. The problem? My BT phone line came in to the house near the front door, on the ground floor, and I wanted them to install ADSL - a high-speed digital line - in the upstairs back bedroom that serves as a home office. What had started as a desire for fast internet access had become an experiment in domestic and social engineering. </p> <p>My idea was a simple one. Rather than laying a new cable through the house, they could take it around the outside and drill in through the back wall. That way, the ADSL socket would appear right next to my PC. As well as high-speed data, ADSL also provides a voice line, but I figured that we could re-use the existing wiring to serve two extensions downstairs. </p> <p>Happily for the fitted carpets and huge piles of books, it worked. One chap clambered around the outside walls while the other got on his knees and installed the small white ADSL socket and a US-made black box about 8in by 7in in area and less than 2in thick. Although it has been rebadged by BT, this appears to be an <a href=\"http://www.efficient.com/products/routbus.html\">Efficient Networks SpeedStream Business Class DSL Router, Model 5861</a>. </p> <p>Installing the line is, of course, only the beginning: the router also has to be connected to a PC, and all the internet software configured to talk to the net. My two installers left and a third chap arrived bearing a 10 megabits/second 3Com Etherlink network card and software. He fitted the card into a spare PCI slot in my PC, connected it to one of the four RJ-11 sockets in the router, restarted my machine, and logged me on to the DLS service via a web page <a href=\"http://192.168.254.254/\" target=\"_new\">http://192.168.254.254</a>. </p> <p>I downloaded a couple of files. Success! </p> <p>One stroke of luck was that my BT Openworld starter pack had failed to arrive, so we didn't have to argue about using the official installation disc. These CDs are, I think, always more trouble than they are worth, and as usual, manual installation in Windows 98SE turned out to be a doddle. </p> <p>The always-on network connection is obviously very attractive, with never any need to \"redial\". Indeed, my internet connection has not only survived the PC being restarted, it has survived the installation of a new electricity meter. Even after all the power in the house was turned off, the router came back up and I was still logged on. </p> <p>The speed - 512kbits/sec - is obviously attractive, too, but after a couple of weeks, I've stopped noticing the improvement. The net runs at the speed of the slowest connection, so the fact that I have a \"fast pipe\" to BT often does not make much difference. </p> <p>If a site takes 30 seconds to respond to a request sent over a slow modem, it still takes 30 seconds to respond to a request sent via ADSL. Network congestion still causes \"brownouts\". And when BT Openworld's domain name look-up service failed last Friday afternoon, and the web disappeared, I had to revert to a dial-up modem. </p> <p>However, ADSL offers some significant advantages. First, once they start to appear, large pages appear almost as quickly as small pages. It may take seven-10 seconds for a web page to start opening, but it usually completes the process in another couple of seconds. But while this is a benefit, it is the way the web should work, and would work if more web site designers did their jobs properly. </p> <p>Second, file transfers can be very fast. Now I can download a 5MB file from an average US server in about five minutes, as opposed to 25 minutes using a V.90/56k modem. Some downloads are faster, of course, but some are much slower, too. </p> <p>Third, streaming video is now just about watchable, as long as you don't make the window too big. Big Brother feeds, for example, at 80kbps provide the equivalent of a five inch TV set, though the image still breaks up with any rapid movement. Further, there's enough bandwidth to let you surf, stream and down- load all at the same time. </p> <p>I'm obviously not using most of the bandwidth that ADSL provides, and the SpeedStream router could support at least three more PCs without suffering undue strain. So my clever plan may have turned out to be a mistake. What I should have done, perhaps, was had the ADSL line routed to a PC server under the stairs, and connected the other PCs in the house together in an Ethernet network. What I'm hoping to do instead is make the links later, using wireless Ethernet cards. </p> <p>But this reveals the deep problem with BT's pricing strategy. A fast connection to a slow internet means that ADSL cries out to be used with home networks: there's enough bandwidth to spare, and to share. Unfortunately, the BT Openworld service I've had installed is great for small businesses but too expensive for most home users at \u00a3100 per month. </p> <p>For home users, BT is planning to offer slower USB serial connections that will be more affordable but will only connect one PC to the net. That could make the back bedroom strategy the right one, but it's a terrible waste of ADSL's potential.</p>",

Mutualism rules OK! </p> <p>A mutualistic association between ants and mealybugs is described by Hoelldobler and Wilson (pp 528-529). The ants protect, transport and maintain their mealybug herds as humans do their internet computers. The food that the ants receive in exchange corresponds to the information and problem-solving that we humans increasingly milk from the internet. </p> <p>A more sinister scenario is also described. A bug called Ptilocerus ochraceus offers an intoxicating secretion to the ant H. bituberculata. When the ant has drunk herself into insensibility, the bug seizes her and sucks her dry of blood. </p> <p>Forms of cyberstimulation, ranging through pornography, cybersex, multimedia violence etc, resemble intoxicating drugs. But unlike the Ptilocerus bug, the internet complex of computers has at present no predatory goals of its own. </p> <p>It reflects only the goals of the institutional proprietors of its myriad sites. So the use of the internet to soften victims up for mugging could only occur as a \"psychological warfare\" weapon of some military, paramilitary or criminal group. </p> <p>More insidious, in associations between two ant species, the parasitic partner can become totally dependent on the host species to feed it and to do all the colony's chores. Eventually the effete beneficiaries sink into a sort of mindless inertia. </p> <p>This would be the ultimate in \"couch potato\" syndrome, already apparent in mild form in the context of television. </p> <p>As more and more of the business of mankind gets carried out by an increasingly smart self- organising planetary network, enter a virulent new strain of couch potato blight. </p> <p>So long as the internet does not begin to build goal structures of its own, independent of those of its proprietary users, all is still in principle controllable and reversible. But a watershed would be encountered if, at any future time, internet agents were to gain the right to administer their own or their proprietors' bank accounts. </p> <p>There would then be little to stop clever but socially insensitive software agents from planning and achieving goals, perhaps set by multinational proprietors, by means that would not necessarily have these same proprietors' approval, such as hiring hit-men, drug dealers, disinformation agencies, mercenaries etc, and bribing regulatory and policing officials. </p> <p>The present drift towards cleavage of our species into an illiterate and destitute majority and a minority of ultra-rich individuals and cyber-savvy corporations could then accelerate, with little attention to the looming abandonment of the majority to famine, war and pestilence. </p> <p>Alternatively, the internet's smart agents might evolve into the mutualistic mealybugs of our human colony. Super-mealybugs will then exchange messages the better to serve us with food for the mind. </p> <p>With due respect to the leaders of the G8 nations, the future internet's intelligent planning agents may become able to offer, even to the minds of these great and good men, new food for thought.</p>",

The ants protect, transport and maintain their mealybug herds as humans do their internet computers. The food that the ants receive in exchange corresponds to the information and problem-solving that we humans increasingly milk from the internet. A more sinister scenario is also described. A bug called Ptilocerus ochraceus offers an intoxicating secretion to the ant H. bituberculata. When the ant has drunk herself into insensibility, the bug seizes her and sucks her dry of blood. Forms of cyberstimulation, ranging through pornography, cybersex, multimedia violence etc, resemble intoxicating drugs. But unlike the Ptilocerus bug, the internet complex of computers has at present no predatory goals of its own. It reflects only the goals of the institutional proprietors of its myriad sites. So the use of the internet to soften victims up for mugging could only occur as a \"psychological warfare\" weapon of some military, paramilitary or criminal group. More insidious, in associations between two ant species, the parasitic partner can become totally dependent on the host species to feed it and to do all the colony's chores. Eventually the effete beneficiaries sink into a sort of mindless inertia. This would be the ultimate in \"couch potato\" syndrome, already apparent in mild form in the context of television. As more and more of the business of mankind gets carried out by an increasingly smart self- organising planetary network, enter a virulent new strain of couch potato blight. So long as the internet does not begin to build goal structures of its own, independent of those of its proprietary users, all is still in principle controllable and reversible. But a watershed would be encountered if, at any future time, internet agents were to gain the right to administer their own or their proprietors' bank accounts. There would then be little to stop clever but socially insensitive software agents from planning and achieving goals, perhaps set by multinational proprietors, by means that would not necessarily have these same proprietors' approval, such as hiring hit-men, drug dealers, disinformation agencies, mercenaries etc, and bribing regulatory and policing officials. The present drift towards cleavage of our species into an illiterate and destitute majority and a minority of ultra-rich individuals and cyber-savvy corporations could then accelerate, with little attention to the looming abandonment of the majority to famine, war and pestilence. Alternatively, the internet's smart agents might evolve into the mutualistic mealybugs of our human colony. Super-mealybugs will then exchange messages the better to serve us with food for the mind. With due respect to the leaders of the G8 nations, the future internet's intelligent planning agents may become able to offer, even to the minds of these great and good men, new food for thought.",

The system has now become the butt of jokes, like the suggestion that with both Wap phones and rap music, the c is silent. </p> <p>The hype machine has already moved on to the next generation: to the general packet radio service (GPRS) that is just starting to emerge, and the universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), for which phone companies are spending billions on licences. </p> <p>Worse, Wap's struggle to find a market in Europe and the US is being contrasted with the exploding popularity of NTT DoCoMo's more advanced i-mode system in Japan. A VHS v Betamax-style formats war may be brewing. What went wrong? </p> <p>Karl Hicks, a mobile market analyst with Datamonitor, a UK-based research firm, says many of the problems have not been down to Wap at all, but the devices and networks used. The small screens on mobile phones, the difficulty of entering text, the slow connection speeds and \"the inability to get on the network, because of bandwidth restrictions, are not Wap's fault, but people associate them with Wap\", he says. </p> <p>But the truth is that the system was massively oversold. When Wap phones and real Wap services became widely available, the flakiness of the reality made the hype unsustainable. And while it is tempting to blame journalists for hyping a system that not all had used, the trade tends to point the finger at BT. </p> <p>When BT Cellnet's managing director, Peter Erskine, launched the UK's first mass market Wap service on April 3, he said: \"Today's announcement shows that BT Cellnet is determined to put the internet in everybody's pocket at an affordable price. We expect that within 18 months, sales of nearly all new mobile phones will be internet-enabled. It is expected by 2003 that more people could be accessing the web from mobile devices than from PCs. In effect, the mobile phone as we know it has had its day!\" </p> <p>If that wasn't bad enough, Erskine's audience was worse. Some seemed to think he had said that Cellnet was putting the web in everybody's pocket, and that it was the PC that had had its day. </p> <p>Obviously they were going to be disappointed when what they got was, in effect, a slow dumb terminal with a tiny monochrome screen that sometimes struggled to display a simple menu or a handful of text. </p> <p>No doubt this is very unfair to Phone.com, the company that invented Wap. Early last year, Macolm Bird, managing director of Phone.com's UK operation, told me: \"Wap isn't about phones surfing the web, it's about using services written for phones and sent to phones. It's possible to go to any web site and extract something that you could display on a mobile phone, but you get a much better service if you design the pages with the mobile in mind. So we do encourage people to write their applications in WML - wireless markup language.\" </p> <p>In other words, Wap was not designed to put \"the internet in your pocket\" but to provide something different. </p> <p>Of course, WML is roughly equivalent to HTML (hypertext markup language), the tagging system used to create web pages. It is also part of a whole raft of incompatible wireless standards that parallel internet standards. Others include WCMP (wireless control message protocol), WTP (wireless transaction protocol), WSP (wireless session protocol), and the scripting language, WMLScript. </p> <p>Sympathy for Phone.com's point of view is therefore mitigated by the fact that Wap has tried to piggy-back on the success of the internet. With hindsight, it might have been better to present it as a different system. </p> <p>For comparison, SMS (Short Message Service) has been hugely successful on mobile phones without anyone trying to pretend that \"texting\" is the same as electronic mail. Both formats are popular precisely because they do something different, and because both have useful applications. </p> <p>Phil Brown, managing director of Nokia UK, says: \"It's unfortunate that Wap has come to dominate the debate, because the consumer offering is not Wap. It's the service the customer is after, not the technology.\" He thinks that people want services that are personal, relevant and perhaps location specific, which could be anything from the football results to the address of the nearest Chinese restaurant. \"If you want to deliver that, then Wap is a very attractive way of doing it.\" </p> <p>The problem is that \"there's a serious lack of compelling Wap applications out there\", according to Tim Sheedy, a senior mobile market analyst with the International Data Corporation. He thinks many of the early adopters bought Wap phones for <a href=\"http://www.tegic.com/t9.html\">Tegic's clever T9 text input system</a>, \"and because they were just cool phones\", but mass market buyers are still waiting for applications. </p> <p>The web could fill the gap, but web content providers are holding back because it means rewriting their HTML sites in WML. As Hicks says, \"It needs a lot more momentum behind Wap before that really starts to happen.\" </p> <p>There are several excuses for holding back. For example, Wap might be overtaken by i-mode, which NTT DoCoMo is keen to export, or another system. Even if it is successful, Wap may have a very short life. Some argue that mobile devices are becoming more powerful every year, and that GPRS and UTMS will make it possible to deliver the whole internet to mobiles within two or three years. What's the point of investing in an incompatible cut-down web when you can have the real thing? </p> <p>I-mode looks good because it uses colour, and its cHTML (Compact HTML) language makes it easier to program, but it could have a tough time in Europe. Sheedy points out that it runs on a packet network, which does not exist in Europe. Also, while i-mode has \"thousands and thousands of applications, most of the content is written in Japanese, and most of the developers who understand cHTML are Japanese\", he says. </p> <p>Although Nokia is the only western company to make an i-mode phone, Brown is also dubious about its prospects here. He attributes much of the system's success to text messaging, because the Japanese didn't have SMS when i-mode was launched. Brown also argues that \"Wap is an evolving concept\" which will soon become more sophisticated. \"We're using Wap version 1.1 now but the discussion of Wap 1.2 is already about moving images,\" he says. \"Wap happens to use WML today, but there's nothing to say that can't alter in the future.\" </p> <p>But people like Robert Neuschul, technical director of Imagineering Technologies, an internet consultancy based in London, still don't see the point. \"We already have technologies in place - SMS, HTML, XML et cetera - so I'm at a loss to understand why we need another specification such as Wap or WML.\" </p> <p>And Neuschul already has what the phone companies are promising, although it's more a concept demonstration than a usable product. \"I've put a Cabletron RoamAbout wireless card in my Jornada handheld,\" he says, \"so I can talk to my sister in Vancouver while browsing for a vintner who could supply a specific vintage Pouilly-Fum\u00e9.\" </p> <p>The HP Jornada has a colour screen and provides a usable level of access to the web and to standard internet email services. </p> <p>It also has a microphone and headphone socket, so it can be used as a phone with free internet-based services such as Go2Call and Net2phone. And you don't ghave to pay international call rates. </p> <p>Although Hewlett-Packard's Jornadas run Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, anyone with a Palm or Psion can see how a plug-in GSM card could turn them into powerful mobile phones, and even Wap phones using <a href=\"http://www.ezos.com\">Ezos software</a>. </p> <p>The phone companies have already recognised the idea's appeal. Three of the biggest - Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola - are working with Psion in the Symbian consortium to develop \"feature phones\" based on Psion's EPOC-32 operating system, and some already sell systems that use Microsoft software. Sony's powerful CMD-Z5 mobile phone, for example, uses Pocket Internet Explorer to handle both standard HTML pages and Wap content. </p> <p>So could telephony become just another aspect of palmtops that, like Microsoft PocketPC systems, already work as MP3 players, email terminals, electronic organisers, games consoles, maps, electronic books? </p> <p>IDC's Sheedy thinks not. \"I think we're going to see a massive fragmentation of devices: maybe someone will want their Walkman to be their mobile phone,\" he says. \"And if you're going out to a night club, do you really want to take your PocketPC?\" </p> <p>Although PDA makers are enjoying a boom in sales, Sheedy reckons their devices will always be bigger and more expensive than mobile phones with small screens and less memory. </p> <p>\"If you ask any handset manufacturer, none of them can say when they will no longer be selling that sort of phone,\" he says. \"There will always be an entry-level handset market.\" </p> <p>And if that's the case, maybe there will always be a need for something like Wap.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> How long have you been involved with the internet?</strong> I've been involved with it for about five years now. It's changed immensely in that time. When I first got involved in 95 I was with Leisure Product and we were the first leisure site to achieve over a million hits in a year. We thought that was great but now we talk about a million hits a day! So I think people's expectations have grown about 350-fold. </p> <p><strong> Are you happy with the way the net's progressing?</strong> If you're actually using it for email, and a lot of people do use it predominantly for email, it's doing a really good job. A lot of people are using it as a more flexible, more usable, fax machine and having a whale of a time with it. But people who use it for leisure tend to be looking for bigger downloads and faster, more reliable connections. </p> <p><strong> What is the role of the modern ISP?</strong> It's to provide a fast, reliable and always available service. Everything else is frills. To draw an analogy, it's like saying 'I'd love to go to the Caribbean but I haven't got any holiday left'. It's daydreaming. It doesn't matter how good everything else is, if you can't get on there in the first place then you'll never see it. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel about ISP's being more accountable for content?</strong> We've always made ourselves accountable for content. Because some of the markets that we serve are schools and families, we have always had SuperNanny as a mirror portal. So we've always been able to say to parents that if they keep the password safe then we'll keep the children safe. </p> <p><strong> Does the prosecution of Demon for content on their servers set a worrying precedent?</strong> We do everything that we can practically do to provide access, security and safety. Beyond that, there's actually very little we can do. There's no use shooting for something that's unattainable. The thing about the internet is that 100% safety 100% of the time and 100% control of 100% of events is never possible. </p> <p><strong> How do you feel about more regulation of the net?</strong> It is actually a very dangerous route to go down because it is all but impossible to impose a regulation. It's that old thing about the only bad laws are the laws you can't enforce! I fail to see how anybody is going to be able to properly and fully enforce regulation on the net. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the net?</strong> You'll find me anywhere DSL technology is being talked about or tested. I book my hotels at <a href=\"http://www.hotel-assist.com\">www.hotel-assist.com</a> and my trains at <a href=\"http://www.trainline.co.uk\">www.trainline.co.uk</a>.

      "bodyText": "How long have you been involved with the internet? I've been involved with it for about five years now. It's changed immensely in that time. When I first got involved in 95 I was with Leisure Product and we were the first leisure site to achieve over a million hits in a year. We thought that was great but now we talk about a million hits a day! So I think people's expectations have grown about 350-fold. Are you happy with the way the net's progressing? If you're actually using it for email, and a lot of people do use it predominantly for email, it's doing a really good job. A lot of people are using it as a more flexible, more usable, fax machine and having a whale of a time with it. But people who use it for leisure tend to be looking for bigger downloads and faster, more reliable connections. What is the role of the modern ISP? It's to provide a fast, reliable and always available service. Everything else is frills. To draw an analogy, it's like saying 'I'd love to go to the Caribbean but I haven't got any holiday left'. It's daydreaming. It doesn't matter how good everything else is, if you can't get on there in the first place then you'll never see it. How do you feel about ISP's being more accountable for content? We've always made ourselves accountable for content. Because some of the markets that we serve are schools and families, we have always had SuperNanny as a mirror portal. So we've always been able to say to parents that if they keep the password safe then we'll keep the children safe. Does the prosecution of Demon for content on their servers set a worrying precedent? We do everything that we can practically do to provide access, security and safety. Beyond that, there's actually very little we can do. There's no use shooting for something that's unattainable. The thing about the internet is that 100% safety 100% of the time and 100% control of 100% of events is never possible. How do you feel about more regulation of the net? It is actually a very dangerous route to go down because it is all but impossible to impose a regulation. It's that old thing about the only bad laws are the laws you can't enforce! I fail to see how anybody is going to be able to properly and fully enforce regulation on the net. Any favourite places on the net? You'll find me anywhere DSL technology is being talked about or tested. I book my hotels at www.hotel-assist.com and my trains at www.trainline.co.uk. One that I love is World Gallery which lets you view, frame and order prints online which are delivered within 48 hours. I like Dog Pile and I also really like UK2. Any favourite gadgets? A favourite toy is a website, Treeway, which allows you to build your own website. It has a number of Flash animations you can choose from and allows you to be your own DJ on your website.",

Researchers from Oregon State University have discovered a powerful anitoxidant in the drink which is more potent than those found in red wine or green tea. The new antioxidant, xanthohumol, is found only in hops. Antioxidants help prevent heart disease and cancer. The ability of beer to mop up dangerous oxidants was already known - but not the exact health-giving agent. But you'd need to drink more than 600 pints a night to gain maximum antioxidant effect. The most likely outcome of this discovery is a xanthohumol pill. </p> <p><strong> Dr Feelgood </strong><br> </p> <p> The placebo effect can ruin clinical trials. The European Society of Cardiology meeting this week was told that patients' assessments of their own health - a major factor in many clincal trials - bore little relation to the actual clinical outcome of their treatment. In a new study, patients with heart disease reported positive health benefits just from seeing a doctor, regardless of the treatment they received. Medical records told a different story. Patients who did not receive surgery for their condition were dying at twice the rate of the surgically-treated patients. \"Even the sickest patients in this study felt better during the time they were being followed by physicians,\" said the cardiologist Dr James Jollis. </p> <p><strong> Bite-sized black hole </strong><br> </p> <p> Scientists gazing at galaxy NGC 4395 were puzzled. Its light was too bright to be caused by a group of stars, but it included the wrong sort of X-ray to be coming from a black hole.

      "bodyText": "Ale and hearty It's official - beer is good for you. Researchers from Oregon State University have discovered a powerful anitoxidant in the drink which is more potent than those found in red wine or green tea. The new antioxidant, xanthohumol, is found only in hops. Antioxidants help prevent heart disease and cancer. The ability of beer to mop up dangerous oxidants was already known - but not the exact health-giving agent. But you'd need to drink more than 600 pints a night to gain maximum antioxidant effect. The most likely outcome of this discovery is a xanthohumol pill. Dr Feelgood The placebo effect can ruin clinical trials. The European Society of Cardiology meeting this week was told that patients' assessments of their own health - a major factor in many clincal trials - bore little relation to the actual clinical outcome of their treatment. In a new study, patients with heart disease reported positive health benefits just from seeing a doctor, regardless of the treatment they received. Medical records told a different story. Patients who did not receive surgery for their condition were dying at twice the rate of the surgically-treated patients. \"Even the sickest patients in this study felt better during the time they were being followed by physicians,\" said the cardiologist Dr James Jollis. Bite-sized black hole Scientists gazing at galaxy NGC 4395 were puzzled. Its light was too bright to be caused by a group of stars, but it included the wrong sort of X-ray to be coming from a black hole. So Cambridge astronomers believe that at the centre of NGC 4395 is a new phenomenon, a relatively tiny \"supermassive\" black hole. Supermassive black holes contain the mass of millions to billions of suns and can be the size of our solar system. The core of NGC 4395 contains the mass of a mere 100,000 suns at most.

In the heat of combat, an uncharitable thought keeps coming back: do you do your best to win and upgrade your wanzer, or throw the fight just to end the adolescent whining of its pilot? Given the hours you have to spend listening to these brats, and the amount of flimflammery before you can even start up your wanzer (browsing the in-game web, travelling backwards and forwards, watching animated sequences), the reward-to-effort ratio is low. Especially since the ugly spectre of Save Points means you may have to sit through it all again. Having said that, it's all too easy to become attached to your wanzer. Parasite Eve II Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Squaresoft ** Two weeks ago I wrote a rather scathing review of this bug-hunting actioner. The copy sent for review was defective and, having now received a fully functional version of the game, I would like to amend my verdict. There is, after all, a run button (and indeed a working options menu). The graphics look crisper, too. However, it's still no easier to fight enemies that are attacking from off the screen. The previous review, then, was of a duff copy of a mediocre game, rather than of a duff game.",

Suddenly playing games became something you did after closing time rather than after school.

But what really matters are the games and a tantalising glimpse via video served only to whet the appetite.

The two companies fell out over Nintendo's decision to use cartridges on the N64, which are expensive and could not store the movie footage used by Square's games.

It was playable at the show with a version of Mario Kart creating the biggest stir. The console is light with an improved LCD screen; however, the shoulder buttons seemed a little far apart and could cause problems for smaller hands. </p> <p>Nevertheless, with improved graphics and sound, backward compatibil ity (all original Game Boy titles can be played) and little competition (SNK's Neo Geo Pocket recently pulled out of the UK market), the Advance looks likely to continue its predecessor's success. </p> <p>As they queued patiently for up to two hours to play on the Advance for only five minutes, the Japanese seemed impressed. \"My children want one and it does look fun,\" said Yoko Shirahase. Hiroshi Ikenaga, who had bought his son to the show primarily to download Celebi, said: \"I like the look of the Advance and will probably buy one.\" </p> <p>Takeo Kohno, 18, needed slightly more convincing. \"It does look impressive, although I want to see what other games are coming out.\" </p> <p>The Gamecube faces a far sterner test. If fantastic games were the prerequisite for success then Nintendo would have little problem. But, as the Sega Dreamcast has shown, marketing and public perception are equally important.
