      "body": "<p>The year our first child was born, Jenny had been planning to spend two months in Kashmir, and I was going to cycle up to the Arctic Circle. We ended up borrowing a caravan in Norfolk for a week. </p> <p>As the number of flight tickets we had to buy increased from two to three to four to five, foreign travel became less and less feasible, and we spent most of our holidays in Britain. But it wasn't the same, until one sunny morning we drove in our old Renault 15 through the Vale of Ewyas, over Gospel Pass and down the hill to Hay-on-Wye. </p> <p>As a schoolboy in the 1950s, the novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin had made the same journey, and he kept returning there for the rest of his short life. Hippies discovered the area in the 1960s, attracted initially by the magic mushrooms in the hills. Some of them stayed, opening craft shops, boutiques, wholefood stores and, more famously, second-hand bookshops, almost, but not quite, becoming respectable members of society. </p> <p>Surrounded on all sides by hills, with the river snaking between them, Hay is a small country town of the kind you can still find in France but which have almost disappeared in Britain. Most have become choked with traffic and buried in industrial and suburban development, but Hay is no bigger than in the 1870s when the diarist Francis Kilvert was curate in the next-door parish. There is almost nowhere in town from where you cannot see open countryside, if only a small square of green between the chimneys. </p> <p>In the early days, we stayed in a tent, later we rented a cottage in the Bullmarket, and even though we get abroad more often, we usually spend Christmas and Easter there. A month or two before we go, Mrs Maddy rings us up to say: \"We've had someone asking about the Rookery, but we didn't know whether you wanted it,\" and when we arrive we find the central heating and the pre-war bed warmers have been switched on. </p> <p>In Hay, the children enjoy a freedom they could not be allowed in London. Even when they were as young as seven and eight, we could safely let them go off on their own to start their mornings with a cup of chocolate in the Blue Boar then head to their favourite shops, where we would later run across them in quiet corners surrounded by piles of books. </p> <p>One winter night in the cavernous Booths in Lion Street, when I thought I was the only person there, I was surprised to hear my son Ned's voice asking at the desk on the floor below, \"Do you have any books on sharks?\" There for \u00a32, I bought a copy of Prep School by James Kenward for no particular reason other that that I would probably never find another copy. (When I was a child, he used to live next door. On hearing he was an author, my mother asked, \"Do you write under a different name?\" which possibly wasn't very tactful.) </p> <p>The upstairs room at Addyman's is like a perfect sitting room, with all the walls covered floor to ceiling with modern first editions and a large comfortable sofa in the middle. Once I went up there to find someone looking remarkably like Marianne Faithfull fast asleep on the sofa. Jenny found a copy of Jalna by Mazo de la Roche, which she had read as a child, and over a couple of hours in half a dozen shops bought all 16 volumes in the series for \u00a32 and \u00a32.50 a time, all with wonderfully lurid 1950s Pan covers. Every time I go to Hay, I look for but never find a copy of Roland Emmett's Home Rails Preferred, which someone borrowed and then lost 25 years ago. I never knew how much I liked it until it went. Good specialist shops include the Castle Bookshop for art books and Francis Edwards, upstairs in the Hay Cinema, which has the best collection of old travel books anywhere in the world. There, we paid \u00a348 for a 1909 illustrated edition of Henry Savage Landor's In the Forbidden Land. </p> <p>There are also craft shops (still good), print shops (expensive) and antique shops (variable), a shop selling nothing but jigsaws, an ice-cream parlour and a Nepalese Bazaar with a bizarre wooden sculpture standing in the corner outside. There used to be a hippie Indian boutique in the Tirolean cottage by the clock, but it closed last year and was replaced by a gift shop, possibly an ominous sign. And for some reason, it is almost impossible to get a good meal in any of the restaurants. The Swan is probably as good as it gets, and at least the staff are friendly. </p> <p>Most of the pubs are worth drinking in, and the Three Tuns is unique. You can imagine Lewis and Benjamin Jones from Chatwin's On the Black Hill dropping in on market day. Inside, nothing has changed for 50 years, except that the pictures have turned black from the smoke. The lager is lukewarm, the crisps barely al dente but the cider is drinkable and the conversation is from an almost vanished age. One day soon, it will be converted into an overpriced restaurant and an era of country ale houses will be over. </p> <p>To the north of the town, the river sparkles in the sunlight like the streams I used to know in the Alborz mountains in Iran. You can walk along the bank from the bridge up to a large open space called the Warren where there are pools deep enough for swimming and flat stones for skimming across the quieter stretches of water. To the south, the road winds up to the hills, and no matter how often we make the journey, there is always a sense of excitement as we go over the cattle grid and on to the open moor. The landscape is rough grass, rock, bracken, gorse, bramble and a few of the kind of trees favoured by set designers for stage productions of Macbeth and Waiting for Godot. </p> <p>In a dip on the left, surrounded entirely by wild moorland, is a house and five acres called Cockalofty. The first time I saw it, it was for sale, and I might have bought it if I hadn't been broke. Later, it was sold to the park authorities and will never come on the market again. </p> <p>Cockalofty is one of the few places in Chatwin's On the Black Hill to be mentioned under its real name. On their way from the Vision Farm to Rhulen (Hay), Lewis and Benjamin would turn left there, which doesn't make a lot of sense on the map until you realise that they wouldn't have been walking along the road but instead would have taken the old footpath, which goes along the side of Tack Wood. If the foot-and-mouth crisis is over by Easter, which doesn't seem likely, we will retrace their footsteps; if not, we will walk up the road to the top of Cusop Dingle, past the elegant Victorian houses with their large gardens on the steeply wooded banks of the Dulas brook. We will stop to admire the house of the solicitor Herbert Rowse Armstrong, the Hay Poisoner, who in 1922 was hanged for murder but still manages occasionally to keep Ned awake at nights, and from the top of the cul-de-sac, we can ride three miles downhill on the micro-scooters, hardly ever meeting a car. </p> <p>High on the hill above Cusop Dingle is a house called Capodolwyn, a large empty ruin standing on its own just below the trees. We often used to see it from Hay car park and the road up to Hay Bluff, and wonder what it was like. Last New Year's Day, when Hay was buried in low cloud, we set off to find it. The fog was so thick that visibility was no more than 10ft, sounds lost their echoes and solid objects had bright haloes rather than shadows. As we reached the house, more by luck than good map-reading, we came out into bright sunshine and the cloud stretched out just beneath our feet as white and opaque as snow. You could almost have walked on it. The house had not been lived in for many years but was everything we wanted it to be. </p> <p>\"No man can wander without a base,\" Chatwin once said. \"You have to have a sort of magic circle to which you belong. It's somewhere you identify with, to which you always happen to go back. This area of the Welsh border I regard as one of the emotional centres of my life.\" </p> <p>One day, Capodolwyn will make a perfect family house for someone, and one day I will go into a Hay bookshop and find a copy of Home Rails Preferred waiting for me, perhaps even the actual copy that I lost. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p>The tourist information bureau (01497 820144, <a href=\"http://www.hay-on-wye.co.uk\">www.hay-on-wye.co.uk</a>) publishes a list of self-catering accommodation in and around Hay.

      "bodyText": "The year our first child was born, Jenny had been planning to spend two months in Kashmir, and I was going to cycle up to the Arctic Circle. We ended up borrowing a caravan in Norfolk for a week. As the number of flight tickets we had to buy increased from two to three to four to five, foreign travel became less and less feasible, and we spent most of our holidays in Britain. But it wasn't the same, until one sunny morning we drove in our old Renault 15 through the Vale of Ewyas, over Gospel Pass and down the hill to Hay-on-Wye. As a schoolboy in the 1950s, the novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin had made the same journey, and he kept returning there for the rest of his short life. Hippies discovered the area in the 1960s, attracted initially by the magic mushrooms in the hills. Some of them stayed, opening craft shops, boutiques, wholefood stores and, more famously, second-hand bookshops, almost, but not quite, becoming respectable members of society. Surrounded on all sides by hills, with the river snaking between them, Hay is a small country town of the kind you can still find in France but which have almost disappeared in Britain. Most have become choked with traffic and buried in industrial and suburban development, but Hay is no bigger than in the 1870s when the diarist Francis Kilvert was curate in the next-door parish. There is almost nowhere in town from where you cannot see open countryside, if only a small square of green between the chimneys. In the early days, we stayed in a tent, later we rented a cottage in the Bullmarket, and even though we get abroad more often, we usually spend Christmas and Easter there. A month or two before we go, Mrs Maddy rings us up to say: \"We've had someone asking about the Rookery, but we didn't know whether you wanted it,\" and when we arrive we find the central heating and the pre-war bed warmers have been switched on. In Hay, the children enjoy a freedom they could not be allowed in London. Even when they were as young as seven and eight, we could safely let them go off on their own to start their mornings with a cup of chocolate in the Blue Boar then head to their favourite shops, where we would later run across them in quiet corners surrounded by piles of books. One winter night in the cavernous Booths in Lion Street, when I thought I was the only person there, I was surprised to hear my son Ned's voice asking at the desk on the floor below, \"Do you have any books on sharks?\" There for \u00a32, I bought a copy of Prep School by James Kenward for no particular reason other that that I would probably never find another copy. (When I was a child, he used to live next door. On hearing he was an author, my mother asked, \"Do you write under a different name?\" which possibly wasn't very tactful.) The upstairs room at Addyman's is like a perfect sitting room, with all the walls covered floor to ceiling with modern first editions and a large comfortable sofa in the middle. Once I went up there to find someone looking remarkably like Marianne Faithfull fast asleep on the sofa. Jenny found a copy of Jalna by Mazo de la Roche, which she had read as a child, and over a couple of hours in half a dozen shops bought all 16 volumes in the series for \u00a32 and \u00a32.50 a time, all with wonderfully lurid 1950s Pan covers. Every time I go to Hay, I look for but never find a copy of Roland Emmett's Home Rails Preferred, which someone borrowed and then lost 25 years ago. I never knew how much I liked it until it went. Good specialist shops include the Castle Bookshop for art books and Francis Edwards, upstairs in the Hay Cinema, which has the best collection of old travel books anywhere in the world. There, we paid \u00a348 for a 1909 illustrated edition of Henry Savage Landor's In the Forbidden Land. There are also craft shops (still good), print shops (expensive) and antique shops (variable), a shop selling nothing but jigsaws, an ice-cream parlour and a Nepalese Bazaar with a bizarre wooden sculpture standing in the corner outside. There used to be a hippie Indian boutique in the Tirolean cottage by the clock, but it closed last year and was replaced by a gift shop, possibly an ominous sign. And for some reason, it is almost impossible to get a good meal in any of the restaurants. The Swan is probably as good as it gets, and at least the staff are friendly. Most of the pubs are worth drinking in, and the Three Tuns is unique. You can imagine Lewis and Benjamin Jones from Chatwin's On the Black Hill dropping in on market day. Inside, nothing has changed for 50 years, except that the pictures have turned black from the smoke. The lager is lukewarm, the crisps barely al dente but the cider is drinkable and the conversation is from an almost vanished age. One day soon, it will be converted into an overpriced restaurant and an era of country ale houses will be over. To the north of the town, the river sparkles in the sunlight like the streams I used to know in the Alborz mountains in Iran. You can walk along the bank from the bridge up to a large open space called the Warren where there are pools deep enough for swimming and flat stones for skimming across the quieter stretches of water. To the south, the road winds up to the hills, and no matter how often we make the journey, there is always a sense of excitement as we go over the cattle grid and on to the open moor. The landscape is rough grass, rock, bracken, gorse, bramble and a few of the kind of trees favoured by set designers for stage productions of Macbeth and Waiting for Godot. In a dip on the left, surrounded entirely by wild moorland, is a house and five acres called Cockalofty. The first time I saw it, it was for sale, and I might have bought it if I hadn't been broke. Later, it was sold to the park authorities and will never come on the market again. Cockalofty is one of the few places in Chatwin's On the Black Hill to be mentioned under its real name. On their way from the Vision Farm to Rhulen (Hay), Lewis and Benjamin would turn left there, which doesn't make a lot of sense on the map until you realise that they wouldn't have been walking along the road but instead would have taken the old footpath, which goes along the side of Tack Wood.

      "body": "<p>There's a saying among fashion types that if they were ever to find themselves anywhere in Italy other than Milan, however aesthetically pleasing or historically rich, they'd hotfoot it to the industrial northern city pronto. For as lacking in living-museum-heritage as it may be and as cold, grey and rainy as it often is, by God it has shopping. </p> <p>Okay, so that first bit might be an urban myth but you don't come to Milan for lazy days exploring piazzas and palazzos. If, on the other hand, it's high-fashion shopping that you're after, there is no better place in the world. </p> <p>And if you're going to do it, you might as well do it properly. Which is why I find myself checking into the Four Seasons on a tiny sidestreet linking Via Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga. In London terms, this would be like having Bond Street and Sloane Street on your doorstep. All-important when you only have a weekend - and the stores are, for the most part, closed on Sunday and Monday mornings - you just tumble out of the well-appointed doors and straight into any number of Italian designer emporia. Your most taxing decision of the day will be which way to turn first - left on to the ferociously fashionable Montenapoleone or right on to the slower-paced but equally chic, pedestrianised della Spiga. </p> <p>So well placed is the Four Seasons that it attracts the fashion industry's finest. Gucci head honcho Tom Ford was booked into a room just along the corridor from mine, and ubermodel, Mark Vanderloo was practically a permanent fixture in the lounge bar. Legendary shopper Elton John likes to check into a suite here whenever he's in town and Gianni Versace used to dine at its swish Il Teatro restaurant. Not surprising since the Versace villa is just along the road - look out for the telltale Medusa heads on the doors. </p> <p>It follows then that you can't beat this part of town for people watching. The so-called Golden Triangle - Montenapo (as it's nicknamed), della Spiga and Sant Andrea - is the setting for a good deal of preening and posturing. Especially on a Saturday afternoon when fiercely stylish women in spikey heels and fur coats, and imposing couples with perfectly groomed dogs stalk from exclusive boutique to exclusive boutique. </p> <p>In Paris, it may be fashionable to parade tiny lapdogs but in macho Milan they brandish brutes. In Dolce &amp; Gabbana, on Via della Spiga, a woman disappeared to the changing room to try on a silver-thread pinstripe suit while her pair of fine pedigree dogs lazed on a zebra skin rug in the middle of the store. When she finally emerged she summoned them with a loud clap of her hands. </p> <p>You will be scrutinised, too, so if you want to be taken remotely seriously (or unless you have the skin of a rhino), make sure you're dressed up to within an inch of your life. On my first day, a Milanese woman checked out my bag so aggressively I feared I was about to be mugged. </p> <p>With prices up to a third cheaper than the UK, all those covetous Italian labels (plus American ones such as Donna Karan and Calvin Klein whose tailoring is made in Italy) suddenly seem dangerously accessible. Dangerously so since because it seems churlish not to take advantage of the apparent savings, it's easy to get whipped up into a frenzy and spend your way into bankruptcy. </p> <p>Enduring classics such as Emporio Armani suits are currently around \u00a3300 (compared to about \u00a3425 in the UK), JP Tod's driving shoes are around \u00a3106 (about \u00a3160 here), Prada nylon and leather bags around \u00a3180 (\u00a3250) and Hogan leather trainers around \u00a3126 (\u00a3169). Visit during the sales (January and early July), and there's a further 30% off. </p> <p>But be prepared to have nerves of steel. The prices may be conducive, but the assistants are not always as welcoming. Actually, they can be terrifying. I had a truly bizarre experience in an empty branch of Prada. As I moved from room to room I was followed by a posse of assistants. Then, when I paid for my purchases at the cash desk, they formed a semi circle around me. Perhaps it's better to do as the Japanese do and shop in packs, so you can sweep in and out without fear of being intimidated. But that's not considered chic. A local woman told me with disdain that Japanese tourists queue outside Gucci at 8am during the sales. What she left unsaid was that the Milanese would never do anything so unstylish. That said, the sales assistants are so accustomed to foreign visitors treating their city as one giant shopping mall that they'll whip out a calculator and work out the price conversions for you. </p> <p>When the well-heeled locals start to wilt under the strain of big-budget spending, they make a stop at Cova. This genteel tearoom on Montenapoleone is the place to be at around 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. Bypass the crowded bar area and make your way to a table in one of the high-ceilinged, crystal-chandeliered siderooms. Then you can linger for as long as you like over mini pastries and coffee. </p> <p>If it's high fashion you want, there's no need to venture outside of the Golden Triangle, although it would be a shame not to explore further afield. A walk (or tram ride) along the via Manzoni will take you past La Scala and into the fantastically ornate Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. Borsalino, the most renowned hat shop in the world, stands at its entrance, the windows filled with such delights as a pink suede scooter helmet with rhinestone studded strap. Around the corner is the famous Savini restaurant, which lists a wonderfully quaint Lunch For Ladies In Shopping on its menu. And, from here, it would be madness not to pop through to the Duomo. Even the most hardened shopper couldn't fail to be impressed by its gothic majesty, although it's a shame about the tannoyed music blaring around the square. </p> <p>Milan's stockhouses - outlets that sell surplus designer stock - have also been attributed jewel-in-the crown status recently but unless you're a diehard bargain hunter, they're not the gems they seem. Unlike the US concept of outlet shops, they mostly resemble giant jumble sales with no logic to the layout in terms of sizing or labels and no changing rooms to try anything on, leaving shoppers to strip off in the aisles. If that's your bag, then you'll love the likes of Il Salvegente (Via Fratelli Bronzini) and Vestistock (Viale Romagna). </p> <p>But why forgo indulging in all the frippery the boutiques have to offer, with their work-of-art interiors and over-the-top tissue paper and ribbons, in favour of scrabbling about for last season's cast-offs? My own attempts at this were pretty disastrous. The first venue I went looking for no longer exists, the second had hugely disappointing stock and the third was a veritable mad house. I beat a hasty retreat to the Emporio Armani superstore on via Manzoni instead. </p> <p>A far better bet for cut-price chic is to forget the designer label altogether and try the multitude of high-quality leather goods stores. Soft leather tote bags in black, camel or berry can be picked up for a very reasonable \u00a360. In the arty Brera district, in particular, there are countless fashionable, mid-priced shoe shops doing their own version of Prada et al. </p> <p>There are more bargains to be had at the Viale Papiniano market next to San Agostino metro. Get there early on a Saturday morning (it opens at 8.30am) for the first drop off of designer stock, but otherwise look out for the no-logo leather bags and cashmere sweaters. There's also a stall that sells good quality leather gloves for under a tenner. Unfortunately, the woman who runs it has despotic tendencies - she won't allow customers to try on anything they pick out for themselves and insisted the pair she chose for me were black when they were clearly brown. </p> <p>Across the road from the market, 1 via Modestino is a handy address to know. Reputedly this is the year to be seen wearing Maxmara, and Arris is a discount outlet for the brand. Unlike a stockhouse, this is set out like a real store with orderly displays and even changing rooms. Every permutation of black trouser is available, from stretch jeans to cashmere pants, and they start at \u00a330, so snap up what you can. I didn't and I'm still regretting it. </p> <p>One metro stop away, at Porta Genova, is Naviglio, a rough-around-the-edges canal-side area, home to the many young models who flock to Milan for work. Despite the grim, chilly day and the overwhelming greyness of the buildings, the raw charm of this artisan district is apparent. As yet unsullied by yuppy apartment developments, it's populated by second-hand shops, delis and the kind of leather goods stores that have craftsmen working away in the background \u00e0 la Pinocchio's Gepetto. </p> <p>With countless bars and restaurants along the length of the canals, it's a buzzing place to be on a Saturday evening. It's also great for Sunday lunch. We stopped at Pizzeria Tradizionale at the head of the Grande Naviglio on Ripa di Porta Ticines. Despite its slightly naff name it was heaving with trendy locals, and no wonder as the food turned out to be fantastic: wonderful fried artichokes, seafood pasta and delicious pizza. </p> <p>Then, with moments to spare before I left, I spotted it. The item of items. The icing on the cake for all the Armani, Prada, Tod's... in the window of a small shop called Borgo Albino sat a pink, slim, ostrich skin belt with diamante buckle. It was without doubt the sort of lucky-find purchase that would have friends back home salivating. But the shop was closed and I had luggage to pack and a plane to catch. So, somewhere on the via Alzala Naviglio Pavase there remains a belt with my name on it. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p>Gillian Rhys was a guest of <a href=\"http://www.exclusivedestinations.co.uk\">Exclusive Italy</a> (01892 619650), which offers two-night breaks to Milan for \u00a3704pp (\u00a3899 for three nights) in a superior double/twin at the five-star Four Seasons Hotel.

      "bodyText": "There's a saying among fashion types that if they were ever to find themselves anywhere in Italy other than Milan, however aesthetically pleasing or historically rich, they'd hotfoot it to the industrial northern city pronto. For as lacking in living-museum-heritage as it may be and as cold, grey and rainy as it often is, by God it has shopping. Okay, so that first bit might be an urban myth but you don't come to Milan for lazy days exploring piazzas and palazzos. If, on the other hand, it's high-fashion shopping that you're after, there is no better place in the world. And if you're going to do it, you might as well do it properly. Which is why I find myself checking into the Four Seasons on a tiny sidestreet linking Via Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga. In London terms, this would be like having Bond Street and Sloane Street on your doorstep. All-important when you only have a weekend - and the stores are, for the most part, closed on Sunday and Monday mornings - you just tumble out of the well-appointed doors and straight into any number of Italian designer emporia. Your most taxing decision of the day will be which way to turn first - left on to the ferociously fashionable Montenapoleone or right on to the slower-paced but equally chic, pedestrianised della Spiga. So well placed is the Four Seasons that it attracts the fashion industry's finest. Gucci head honcho Tom Ford was booked into a room just along the corridor from mine, and ubermodel, Mark Vanderloo was practically a permanent fixture in the lounge bar. Legendary shopper Elton John likes to check into a suite here whenever he's in town and Gianni Versace used to dine at its swish Il Teatro restaurant. Not surprising since the Versace villa is just along the road - look out for the telltale Medusa heads on the doors. It follows then that you can't beat this part of town for people watching. The so-called Golden Triangle - Montenapo (as it's nicknamed), della Spiga and Sant Andrea - is the setting for a good deal of preening and posturing. Especially on a Saturday afternoon when fiercely stylish women in spikey heels and fur coats, and imposing couples with perfectly groomed dogs stalk from exclusive boutique to exclusive boutique. In Paris, it may be fashionable to parade tiny lapdogs but in macho Milan they brandish brutes. In Dolce &amp; Gabbana, on Via della Spiga, a woman disappeared to the changing room to try on a silver-thread pinstripe suit while her pair of fine pedigree dogs lazed on a zebra skin rug in the middle of the store. When she finally emerged she summoned them with a loud clap of her hands. You will be scrutinised, too, so if you want to be taken remotely seriously (or unless you have the skin of a rhino), make sure you're dressed up to within an inch of your life. On my first day, a Milanese woman checked out my bag so aggressively I feared I was about to be mugged. With prices up to a third cheaper than the UK, all those covetous Italian labels (plus American ones such as Donna Karan and Calvin Klein whose tailoring is made in Italy) suddenly seem dangerously accessible. Dangerously so since because it seems churlish not to take advantage of the apparent savings, it's easy to get whipped up into a frenzy and spend your way into bankruptcy. Enduring classics such as Emporio Armani suits are currently around \u00a3300 (compared to about \u00a3425 in the UK), JP Tod's driving shoes are around \u00a3106 (about \u00a3160 here), Prada nylon and leather bags around \u00a3180 (\u00a3250) and Hogan leather trainers around \u00a3126 (\u00a3169). Visit during the sales (January and early July), and there's a further 30% off. But be prepared to have nerves of steel. The prices may be conducive, but the assistants are not always as welcoming. Actually, they can be terrifying. I had a truly bizarre experience in an empty branch of Prada. As I moved from room to room I was followed by a posse of assistants. Then, when I paid for my purchases at the cash desk, they formed a semi circle around me. Perhaps it's better to do as the Japanese do and shop in packs, so you can sweep in and out without fear of being intimidated. But that's not considered chic. A local woman told me with disdain that Japanese tourists queue outside Gucci at 8am during the sales. What she left unsaid was that the Milanese would never do anything so unstylish. That said, the sales assistants are so accustomed to foreign visitors treating their city as one giant shopping mall that they'll whip out a calculator and work out the price conversions for you. When the well-heeled locals start to wilt under the strain of big-budget spending, they make a stop at Cova. This genteel tearoom on Montenapoleone is the place to be at around 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. Bypass the crowded bar area and make your way to a table in one of the high-ceilinged, crystal-chandeliered siderooms. Then you can linger for as long as you like over mini pastries and coffee. If it's high fashion you want, there's no need to venture outside of the Golden Triangle, although it would be a shame not to explore further afield. A walk (or tram ride) along the via Manzoni will take you past La Scala and into the fantastically ornate Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. Borsalino, the most renowned hat shop in the world, stands at its entrance, the windows filled with such delights as a pink suede scooter helmet with rhinestone studded strap. Around the corner is the famous Savini restaurant, which lists a wonderfully quaint Lunch For Ladies In Shopping on its menu. And, from here, it would be madness not to pop through to the Duomo. Even the most hardened shopper couldn't fail to be impressed by its gothic majesty, although it's a shame about the tannoyed music blaring around the square. Milan's stockhouses - outlets that sell surplus designer stock - have also been attributed jewel-in-the crown status recently but unless you're a diehard bargain hunter, they're not the gems they seem. Unlike the US concept of outlet shops, they mostly resemble giant jumble sales with no logic to the layout in terms of sizing or labels and no changing rooms to try anything on, leaving shoppers to strip off in the aisles. If that's your bag, then you'll love the likes of Il Salvegente (Via Fratelli Bronzini) and Vestistock (Viale Romagna). But why forgo indulging in all the frippery the boutiques have to offer, with their work-of-art interiors and over-the-top tissue paper and ribbons, in favour of scrabbling about for last season's cast-offs? My own attempts at this were pretty disastrous. The first venue I went looking for no longer exists, the second had hugely disappointing stock and the third was a veritable mad house.

      "body": "<p>Like fine wine, kids don't travel well. The loo stops, the incessant \"Are we nearly there yet?\", the car-sickness and the boredom make even the most resilient parents gulp at the thought of the annual family holiday. It's not so much the being there that freezes courage, more the actual getting there - and back, of course. Whichever way you choose to travel - air, rail, ferry or car - it won't suit somebody. Bearing this in mind, and starting with the worst possible scenario as a baseline, the most dire thing that can happen is that your expectations will be met. The best picture is that travelling becomes an exciting adventure, and a bit of advance preparation to quell the dullest moments can ensure travelling tranquility. The more involvement the kids have in the planning stages of the trip, the more interested they are likely to be. Follow a few simple guidelines, do a spot of advance shopping, cross your fingers and hope for the best. </p> <p><strong> Baby on board</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 If there is one thing a baby loathes, it is take-off and landing in an aircraft. Pressure on their ear-drums causes much squeaking. If you breast feed, make sure your little one is well latched on, if you don't, ensure a bottle is well and truly at the ready. The sucking action will help distract him or her, and soothe the pressure. </p> <p> \u0095 Try to travel during your baby's natural sleep time. </p> <p> \u0095 Keep it short. It is unrealistic to expect a dream passage to Australia with a wriggly baby on your lap. </p> <p> \u0095 Take warm clothing for flights. Aeroplanes have Arctic air conditioning. </p> <p><strong> Tricky toddlers</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 If you are travelling by car, plan plenty of breaks. </p> <p> \u0095 Pack them their own little picnic box with a few favourite treats to munch. </p> <p> \u0095 Don't take their beloved cuddly. There is no other sure-fire way to ruin your holiday than losing their most precious companion. (Sensible parents have a \"double\" for just such events). </p> <p> \u0095 If all else fails, sing. Toddlers adore a good sing-song. Story and music tapes might help. </p> <p><strong> School age</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 Don't ever let yourself be heard moaning about how ghastly the journey will be. If you stay upbeat and positive, it may well not occur to the children that travelling can be anything other than interesting. </p> <p> \u0095 Pack a couple of new games (see below) or toys. </p> <p> \u0095 If you are flying or travelling by Eurostar, forget packing crayons and drawing books. Most airlines have a free pack to give out to kids, and Eurostar's pack comes in a handy backpack. </p> <p> \u0095 Ring your airline ahead and order children's meals. Airline food is usually grim, but there isn't much they can do to chicken nuggets that hasn't already been done by the school dinner lady. </p> <p><strong> So, you got there...</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 If in sunny climes, buy a small inflatable boat (with safety rope) for the beach. It is the most versatile holiday accessory. Use to bed down tired toddlers under the shade of an umbrella; fill with sand for a safe and contained baby sand pit; fill with water for a paddling pool; or have a gentle bob on the waves at the water's edge. </p> <p> \u0095 When your kids are happy playing on the beach, don't drag them miles to see ancient monuments and ruins. They'll whinge and you'll get cross. </p> <p> \u0095 Make it a priority on arrival to have the phone numbers and addresses of the nearest dentist, doctor, hospital and chemist. Looking for emergency information in a panic is hopeless. </p> <p> \u0095 Don't hassle your kids. If they want to eat pizza and chips for a fortnight, then let them. You have 50 more weeks to be right about their diet. Holidays are about fun - don't rain on the party by being a pooper. </p> <p><strong>Anti Nausea Band</strong>, \u00a37.49. The Great Little Trading Company, tel: 08702 414080 </p> <p>Works by applying pressure on points in the wrist, supposedly reducing travel sickness. May even work on a psycological basis. </p> <p><strong> First-Aid Kit</strong>, \u00a326.95. Urchin Mail Order, tel: 01672 872872 </p> <p>An all-minor-emergency first-aid kit is a very useful addition to holiday luggage. Who wants to trek round the backwaters of a Spanish village looking for an all-night chemist? This one is compact and comprehensive. </p> <p><strong> Drink &amp; Snack Combo</strong>, \u00a34.95. PHP, tel: 0870 6070545 </p> <p>A very neat idea which will appeal to tiny travellers, too. The non-spill beaker section comes with a twist-off compartment for snacks. Small enough for packing, but large enough for a good amount of drink and treats. </p> <p><strong> Identity Bands</strong>, \u00a34.95. Urchin Mail Order, tel: 01672 872872 </p> <p>Snappy and colourful, these identity bands are ideal for busy beaches and peace of mind. Never write your child's name, but do put a mobile number, your apartment address or hotel details. </p> <p><strong> Talkabout TA288</strong>, \u00a3100 per handset. Motorola, tel: 0870 9010555 for stockists </p> <p>Initially seems like the ultimate neurotic parent tool, but walkie talkies are extremely handy on the beach, on long walks, at theme parks or anywhere your group is likely to seperate to do different things. Like a short-distance mobile phone, but no-risk factor and no expensive bills. </p> <p> <strong> Car Seat Activity Panel</strong>, \u00a319.95. PHP, tel: 0870 6070545 </p> <p>A travelling baby needs plenty to occupy the time. This neat little activity panel attaches from the car head rest. </p> <p><strong> Magnetic Ludo</strong>, \u00a34. ELC, tel: 08705 352352 </p> <p>In its own carry pack, this game for two to four players is a modern version of a family favourite. The magnets stop small pieces falling everywhere. The set is lightweight and appropriate for all ages. </p> <p><strong> Travel Twister</strong>, \u00a33.99. Tel: 0800 3287007 for stockists </p> <p>For travellers who love gadgets, this is a neat little game of Finger Twister. Pocket-sized, eminently portable and a great laugh for older kids. </p> <p><strong> Travel Scribbler</strong>, \u00a310. ELC, tel: 08705 352352 </p> <p>The no fuss, no pen, no rubber drawing set. The Scribbler is good for noughts and crosses, hang-man, silly sketches and any number of rude rhymes. This mini version is the perfect travel companion. </p> <p><strong> Magnetic Design Board</strong>, \u00a37.99. Tridias, tel: 0870 2402104 </p> <p>Nippy device for creating all sorts of weird and wonderful pictures with the 56 shapes and designs that cling to the board magnetically. The flat metal board is easily incorporated into luggage or backpacks. </p> <p><strong> Pass the sick bag</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 The Homeopathic remedy, Travella, by Nelson's has a reputation for quelling those queasy feelings. Available at chemists. </p> <p>\u0095 Peppermint is known for its strong anti-nausea properties. </p> <p>\u0095 The Travelwell Tape is ideal for car journeys. The \"white noise\" desensitises the vestibular system in the inner ear, preventing nausea. \u00a310.99 at branches of Boots and Superdrug. </p> <p>\u0095 Never let your children read in the car. It's sure to induce copious amounts of vomiting. </p> <p><strong> Web resources:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cyberparent.com\">www.cyberparent.com</a> has instructions for The Coin Game and Drawing Charades; <a href=\"http://www.family.com\">www.family.com</a> is packed full of ideas for travel games. </p> <p><strong> Recommended reading:</strong> Have Baby, Will Travel, by Sarah Tucker, \u00a312.99. </p> <p> <strong>Easter special</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/feature/0,8806,462011,00.html\">Spring boards</a><br>You haven't missed the boat to get away.

If you breast feed, make sure your little one is well latched on, if you don't, ensure a bottle is well and truly at the ready. The sucking action will help distract him or her, and soothe the pressure. \u0095 Try to travel during your baby's natural sleep time. \u0095 Keep it short. It is unrealistic to expect a dream passage to Australia with a wriggly baby on your lap. \u0095 Take warm clothing for flights. Aeroplanes have Arctic air conditioning. Tricky toddlers \u0095 If you are travelling by car, plan plenty of breaks. \u0095 Pack them their own little picnic box with a few favourite treats to munch. \u0095 Don't take their beloved cuddly. There is no other sure-fire way to ruin your holiday than losing their most precious companion. (Sensible parents have a \"double\" for just such events). \u0095 If all else fails, sing. Toddlers adore a good sing-song. Story and music tapes might help. School age \u0095 Don't ever let yourself be heard moaning about how ghastly the journey will be. If you stay upbeat and positive, it may well not occur to the children that travelling can be anything other than interesting. \u0095 Pack a couple of new games (see below) or toys. \u0095 If you are flying or travelling by Eurostar, forget packing crayons and drawing books. Most airlines have a free pack to give out to kids, and Eurostar's pack comes in a handy backpack. \u0095 Ring your airline ahead and order children's meals. Airline food is usually grim, but there isn't much they can do to chicken nuggets that hasn't already been done by the school dinner lady. So, you got there... \u0095 If in sunny climes, buy a small inflatable boat (with safety rope) for the beach. It is the most versatile holiday accessory. Use to bed down tired toddlers under the shade of an umbrella; fill with sand for a safe and contained baby sand pit; fill with water for a paddling pool; or have a gentle bob on the waves at the water's edge. \u0095 When your kids are happy playing on the beach, don't drag them miles to see ancient monuments and ruins. They'll whinge and you'll get cross. \u0095 Make it a priority on arrival to have the phone numbers and addresses of the nearest dentist, doctor, hospital and chemist. Looking for emergency information in a panic is hopeless. \u0095 Don't hassle your kids. If they want to eat pizza and chips for a fortnight, then let them. You have 50 more weeks to be right about their diet. Holidays are about fun - don't rain on the party by being a pooper. Anti Nausea Band, \u00a37.49. The Great Little Trading Company, tel: 08702 414080 Works by applying pressure on points in the wrist, supposedly reducing travel sickness. May even work on a psycological basis. First-Aid Kit, \u00a326.95. Urchin Mail Order, tel: 01672 872872 An all-minor-emergency first-aid kit is a very useful addition to holiday luggage. Who wants to trek round the backwaters of a Spanish village looking for an all-night chemist? This one is compact and comprehensive. Drink &amp; Snack Combo, \u00a34.95. PHP, tel: 0870 6070545 A very neat idea which will appeal to tiny travellers, too. The non-spill beaker section comes with a twist-off compartment for snacks. Small enough for packing, but large enough for a good amount of drink and treats. Identity Bands, \u00a34.95. Urchin Mail Order, tel: 01672 872872 Snappy and colourful, these identity bands are ideal for busy beaches and peace of mind. Never write your child's name, but do put a mobile number, your apartment address or hotel details. Talkabout TA288, \u00a3100 per handset. Motorola, tel: 0870 9010555 for stockists Initially seems like the ultimate neurotic parent tool, but walkie talkies are extremely handy on the beach, on long walks, at theme parks or anywhere your group is likely to seperate to do different things. Like a short-distance mobile phone, but no-risk factor and no expensive bills. Car Seat Activity Panel, \u00a319.95. PHP, tel: 0870 6070545 A travelling baby needs plenty to occupy the time. This neat little activity panel attaches from the car head rest. Magnetic Ludo, \u00a34. ELC, tel: 08705 352352 In its own carry pack, this game for two to four players is a modern version of a family favourite. The magnets stop small pieces falling everywhere. The set is lightweight and appropriate for all ages. Travel Twister, \u00a33.99. Tel: 0800 3287007 for stockists For travellers who love gadgets, this is a neat little game of Finger Twister. Pocket-sized, eminently portable and a great laugh for older kids. Travel Scribbler, \u00a310. ELC, tel: 08705 352352 The no fuss, no pen, no rubber drawing set. The Scribbler is good for noughts and crosses, hang-man, silly sketches and any number of rude rhymes. This mini version is the perfect travel companion. Magnetic Design Board, \u00a37.99. Tridias, tel: 0870 2402104 Nippy device for creating all sorts of weird and wonderful pictures with the 56 shapes and designs that cling to the board magnetically. The flat metal board is easily incorporated into luggage or backpacks. Pass the sick bag \u0095 The Homeopathic remedy, Travella, by Nelson's has a reputation for quelling those queasy feelings. Available at chemists. \u0095 Peppermint is known for its strong anti-nausea properties. \u0095 The Travelwell Tape is ideal for car journeys. The \"white noise\" desensitises the vestibular system in the inner ear, preventing nausea. \u00a310.99 at branches of Boots and Superdrug. \u0095 Never let your children read in the car. It's sure to induce copious amounts of vomiting. Web resources: www.cyberparent.com has instructions for The Coin Game and Drawing Charades; www.family.com is packed full of ideas for travel games.

      "body": "<p>I really like CenterParcs. Those who have not yet visited these forest resorts mistakenly think of them as a middle-class Butlins, regimented and landmined with compulsory public embarrassments. Far from it. Villas are secluded enough to suit the most dedicated misanthrope. You can do as much or as little as you please from their enormous range of activities and there is no obligatory shoulder-rubbing with other holidaymakers. The nearest one gets to a knobbly knees contest is the back row of cardio kick-boxing in the fitness studio. </p> <p>It would take a stronger will than mine, though, not to get mixed up in the whole swirling, healthy, toddler-carpeted, pedal-pushing maelstrom. Elveden, Longleat, Sherwood - this family has done all the UK bases at least twice during the past seven years, as well as Channel-hopping to La Bruy\u00e8res in France, part of a Continental network that also includes centres in Belgium, Holland and Germany. </p> <p>But now the boys are teenagers, urban ones at that. The 15-year-old's chief leisure activity involves being the drummer in the kind of band that makes noises like a washing machine being thrown out of a window. He is too old for the CenterParcs football course, and too young for the gym. The 13-year-old, meanwhile, is umbilically attached to his PlayStation 2. </p> <p>The big question was whether they would be quite as diverted as they once were by the wholesome delights of nature trails and wild water rapids, or whether they would lurk around sullenly in their boxer shorts, bickering over custody of the remote and refusing to join in. In short, were the days of our CenterParcs family holidays finally over? </p> <p>The destination this time was a midweek break at Longleat Forest, built on a kind of mini-Pyrenees in bucolic Wiltshire and featuring villas and apartments set among giant redwood trees and laced by boardwalks zig-zagging through banks of azaleas. The company is constantly updating, upgrading and refurbishing the sites, and has added Wine &amp; Food breaks to its Fitness Motivation weekends, but the basic format of the three or five-day short-break holiday hasn't changed: no cars, loads of fresh air, and plenty of opportunity for children to roam unsupervised in a small, idyllic universe. </p> <p>You still arrive there stressed out, work-worn and full of bile. You set up home in a forest glade in your own villa or apartment, wake up each day to the honk of wild ducks and the tinkle of bicycle bells. You cycle and walk, snooze and laze, have facials and manicures, jump around in the gym a bit and leave a few days later in a state of almost eerie serenity. </p> <p>All the villas have been redecorated and refurbished, and have 13-channel TV, central heating, open fire, microwave and conventional cooker. We stayed in a two-bedroomed Executive Villa, the extra \u00a3150 charge more than made up for by the arrival of a maid every morning to make the beds and vacuum up all the Pringles crumbs that teenagers leave like spoors. Also thrown in were a hydrobath, extra loo, hairdryer and phone, and we were even supplied with a sachet of washing-up liquid - the one thing I always forget to bring. </p> <p>Unlike at the other CenterParcs, where the main centres of activity are more or less contiguous upon each other, you need pedal power and navigational skills for Longleat, though there is a Land Train that will deposit you at all the essential venues. Of these, the Plaza has the Subtropical Swimming Paradise, the Parcmarket, three eateries (Luciano's, Huckleberry's and Chez Pierre) and newly-rejigged Roman-style tenpin bowling with adjacent disco, all indoors under a huge bubble of a roof beside which the waters of the Wild Water Rapids and hot outside pool hiss and sluice most dramatically in the Wiltshire twilight. </p> <p>As ever, family members went their separate ways from day one, each flinging themselves into an ambitious schedule of whatever they fancied. I enjoyed my usual aerobic overdose - aerobikes (\u00a34 exhilaratingly spent), aerobic cocktail (\u00a33.50) and an hour in the fitness studio (unlimited midweek use \u00a38.50). The Pilates class was, alas, full, so I consoled myself by lobbing an enormous amount of money in the direction of Nike and Reebok at the Sportique and had to book myself for some rest and recovery with a facial at the Aqua Sana health spa (25 minutes, \u00a319, lovely). </p> <p>Meanwhile, the boys jumped on their bikes and headed straight for the Subtropical Swimming Paradise, open from 10am to 10pm and use of which is included in the cost of the holiday. When they were flumed out, they tried things they wouldn't consider in a million years back in town, such as Laser Clay Shooting (\u00a315 for 45 minutes, enthusiastic applause for the instructor), the Golf Simulator (not a snip at \u00a320 an hour, but highly entertaining) and Roller-Skating (\u00a32.50, hurrah). I hadn't anticipated the sheer pleasure they would take in being able to plan their own activities and get to them independently rather than being ferried around traffic-choked roads by a chain of irascible parents. </p> <p>The boys were old enough to eat where they chose, so while they dined US-style at Huckleberry's, mum and dad pigged out at La Sapini\u00e8re, which featured the sort of ivory-tickling pianist whom the husband always starts applauding and waving at after the second bottle. </p> <p>The catering at CenterParcs has improved noticeably. Last year, all the head chefs were despatched to France to see how things could be done, with the result that beetroot risotto (very tasty) and baked cod and mash (ditto) now feature on the menu. The Parcmarket mini-supermarket has been \"Islingtoned\", too, balsamic vinegar and red Camargue rice joining more traditional items on the shelf. </p> <p>The best family meal of the entire break was at the Country Club restaurant, situated within the Jardin des Sports - grand fish and chips and rib-eye steak, warm and efficient service and a young magician from Weston-Super-Mare, Noah Kelly, who toured the tables doing fab card tricks and caused the boys' attitude to be rapidly revised from disdainful embarrassment to childlike pleading for dachshunds made out of blue balloons. </p> <p>There were some imperfections. At \u00a312.50 a week, the bicycles available for hire weren't great - getting the dynamos to work entailed the destruction of several fingernails; Aqua Sana and the Jardin des Sports are to be found mainly by a series of hints and clues rather than the signposting. But these were piffling irritations compared to the sheer fun of the almost endless permutations of activity and the restorative value of slumping on one of the villa's new comfy sofas, relishing a birdsong-filled quietness broken only by the occasional oaths of people who couldn't get their dynamos to work. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong><br> </p> <p>Julie Welch and family paid \u00a3638 for a Monday-Friday midweek break at the two-bedroom Executive Villa, Longleat Forest.

In her first interview since her surprise announcement on Tuesday that she would quit the human rights commission, she told the Guardian that she had been taken aback by the lack of funding when she arrived at the Geneva headquarters more than three years ago. Funding today, she confessed, was little better: \"It is shoe-string. It is a frayed shoe-string.\" The UN, which has been sensitive lately since having its reputation battered by accusations of poor management and bureaucracy, is nervous at the prospect of having such a critic on the outside, especially one with inside knowledge. Its hope is that once Mrs Robinson leaves office her voice will be blunted without an organisation behind her. Cynical speculation within the UN is that she has another big international job lined up, possibly with a group such as Amnesty International. Speaking in Geneva yesterday afternoon, however, she denied having a job in the pipeline and said she was looking for \"an academic position\" that she could use as a base for her campaign. She said her intention was to \"raise the political temperature\" because human rights is so far down the global agenda, and to force UN members states to put up more cash.

She said only 15 of the field staff, mainly those in Cambodia, were full-time; most of the others were on three- or six-month contracts. Worries about job security were so prevalent, she said, that it was difficult for the organisation to run efficiently. Had money been available, Mrs Robinson said she would have set up a permanent, fast-reaction force to deal with situations such as the discovery of mass graves in Afghanistan.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Spring is usually the best time to make a guided descent between the glacial crevasses of the spectacular <strong>Vall\u00e9e Blanche</strong> above Chamonix. The most commonly-skied route starts beneath the sharp spire of the Aiguille du Midi and runs for more than 14 miles. It is well within the capabilities of skiers able to make basic parallel turns, though you may need to screw up your courage for the initial walk down steps cut into a narrow spine of snow from the lift, for which you are normally roped up and provided with crampons. </p> <p>Budget self-drive packages to the resort for the week leading up to Easter are still available from Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays (0870 3332001). Three sharing self-catering accommodation would pay \u00a3110 a head (\u00a3165 each for two). The firm has other late deals in the French Alps. Four people sharing a self-catering studio for seven nights starting on April 7 in <strong> Flaine</strong>, for example, would pay \u00a398 a head. Two sharing would pay \u00a3196 each. Similar accommodation is on offer in <strong> M\u00e9ribel </strong> at \u00a3123 for each of four or \u00a3245 if two share. And a week starting next Saturday (March 31) in <strong> La Tania</strong>, which is connected by gondola lift to the <strong> Trois Vall\u00e9es</strong>, costs \u00a393 a head for four in a two-room apartment or \u00a3185 for two. All prices include Channel Tunnel crossings. </p> <p>\u0095 Long weekends in late April, allowing three full days of skiing in the French Alps, are available from Thomson. Four resorts are on offer - <strong> Val d'Is\u00e8re</strong>, <strong>Tignes</strong>, <strong> Val Thorens </strong> and <strong> Courchevel</strong>. Departures are on April, with prices starting at \u00a3229. That gets you flights from Gatwick to Lyon, a hire car and chalet accommodation with breakfast, packed lunch and dinner with wine. Travel arrangements are flexible. If you are prepared for a late-night drive, you could, for example, do a full day's work on a Thursday and fly out at 7.10pm, arriving at 9.45pm. </p> <p>\u0095 Last-minute deals to Italy are available from Inghams (020-8780 4400). The firm is offering one-week chalet packages to <strong> Selva</strong> for \u00a3259 and half-board hotel holidays in <strong> Livigno</strong> for \u00a3269. The former is part of the enormous Sella Ronda network in the Dolomites, where a single lift pass covers nearly 740 miles of pistes connected by 464 lifts. The latter, which is most suitable for intermediates and where snow conditions were reported to be excellent this week, is close to the Swiss border. In both cases, flights are from Gatwick and prices are based on two sharing accommodation, which will be allocated on arrival. </p> <p>\u0095 Free lift passes worth up to \u00a3100 a time are on offer to customers buying early April packages in the French resort of <strong>Courchevel </strong> from Flexiski (0870 9090754). The deal applies to bookings at the Hotel de la Croisette in Courchevel 1850 between April 5 and 19. Four nights (April 5 - 9) cost \u00a3625 and a week (April 5 - 12) is \u00a3715. Prices include flights from Heathrow, Gatwick or London City, accommodation and breakfast. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Zermatt</strong> should still offer good conditions in the run up to Easter, at least on the upper slopes. Powder Byrne (020-8246 5300) still has holidays available there with departures from Heathrow on April 8. One week's half-board costs from \u00a3829. The firm offers various arrangements for parents wanting to ski without their children. Creches for children between six months and three years cost \u00a3150 a week and clubs for four to nine-year-olds and 10 to 14s for \u00a3265 and \u00a3245 respectively.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Spring is usually the best time to make a guided descent between the glacial crevasses of the spectacular Vall\u00e9e Blanche above Chamonix. The most commonly-skied route starts beneath the sharp spire of the Aiguille du Midi and runs for more than 14 miles. It is well within the capabilities of skiers able to make basic parallel turns, though you may need to screw up your courage for the initial walk down steps cut into a narrow spine of snow from the lift, for which you are normally roped up and provided with crampons. Budget self-drive packages to the resort for the week leading up to Easter are still available from Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays (0870 3332001). Three sharing self-catering accommodation would pay \u00a3110 a head (\u00a3165 each for two). The firm has other late deals in the French Alps. Four people sharing a self-catering studio for seven nights starting on April 7 in Flaine, for example, would pay \u00a398 a head. Two sharing would pay \u00a3196 each. Similar accommodation is on offer in M\u00e9ribel at \u00a3123 for each of four or \u00a3245 if two share. And a week starting next Saturday (March 31) in La Tania, which is connected by gondola lift to the Trois Vall\u00e9es, costs \u00a393 a head for four in a two-room apartment or \u00a3185 for two. All prices include Channel Tunnel crossings. \u0095 Long weekends in late April, allowing three full days of skiing in the French Alps, are available from Thomson. Four resorts are on offer - Val d'Is\u00e8re, Tignes, Val Thorens and Courchevel. Departures are on April, with prices starting at \u00a3229. That gets you flights from Gatwick to Lyon, a hire car and chalet accommodation with breakfast, packed lunch and dinner with wine. Travel arrangements are flexible. If you are prepared for a late-night drive, you could, for example, do a full day's work on a Thursday and fly out at 7.10pm, arriving at 9.45pm. \u0095 Last-minute deals to Italy are available from Inghams (020-8780 4400). The firm is offering one-week chalet packages to Selva for \u00a3259 and half-board hotel holidays in Livigno for \u00a3269. The former is part of the enormous Sella Ronda network in the Dolomites, where a single lift pass covers nearly 740 miles of pistes connected by 464 lifts. The latter, which is most suitable for intermediates and where snow conditions were reported to be excellent this week, is close to the Swiss border. In both cases, flights are from Gatwick and prices are based on two sharing accommodation, which will be allocated on arrival. \u0095 Free lift passes worth up to \u00a3100 a time are on offer to customers buying early April packages in the French resort of Courchevel from Flexiski (0870 9090754). The deal applies to bookings at the Hotel de la Croisette in Courchevel 1850 between April 5 and 19. Four nights (April 5 - 9) cost \u00a3625 and a week (April 5 - 12) is \u00a3715. Prices include flights from Heathrow, Gatwick or London City, accommodation and breakfast. \u0095 Zermatt should still offer good conditions in the run up to Easter, at least on the upper slopes. Powder Byrne (020-8246 5300) still has holidays available there with departures from Heathrow on April 8. One week's half-board costs from \u00a3829. The firm offers various arrangements for parents wanting to ski without their children. Creches for children between six months and three years cost \u00a3150 a week and clubs for four to nine-year-olds and 10 to 14s for \u00a3265 and \u00a3245 respectively.",

      "body": "<p>The joys of urban walking may not be immediately obvious to countrygoing types frustrated by the present foot-and-mouth restrictions. But walking the streets of a large city gives a completely different perspective to the one from a car or bus. The first thing you notice is the architecture - looking above the neon-lit shopfronts, a whole new world of ornate Victorian windows and gables is often revealed, bristling with details the motorist cannot see. The other advantage is that you need no equipment, other than a stout pair of shoes, to do it. </p> <p>The following are a few suggestions of how to explore some of our most interesting cities on foot. </p> <p><strong> Bath</strong><br> </p> <p>You need to revert to the pace of the pedestrian to really appreciate the architectural glories of this Georgian city. </p> <p>Start from the Great Baths in Stall Street, where the Romans built their naturally-heated baths complex next to a temple they cleverly dedicated to Sulis Minerva - Sul being an ancient Celtic god and Minerva, the Roman goddess of healing. Adjacent is the Pump Room that became the social centre of the fashionable spa during Bath's heyday under Richard \"Beau\" Nash during the 18th century. Just behind the Baths stands stately Bath Abbey, built between 1495 and 1503 and famous for its soaring internal fan vaulting and the ladder-climbing angels on its western front. </p> <p>A two-minute walk down Abbey Green takes you to Sally Lunn's House, built around 1622 and now a delightful tearoom, where you can enjoy the delicious Bath (or Sally Lunn) Buns. Head north up Terrace Walk and you soon arrive at the Grand Parade and a stupendous view of the River Avon as it flows under the Italianate Pulteney Bridge. Built by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, in 1770, it was inspired by the Pontevecchio in Florence and is still lined with tiny shops, shoehorned in across the width of the bridge. </p> <p>About half a mile away, down Upper Borough Walls or Quiet Street and along Gay Street, you pass John Wood's Queen Square, to reach the classical columned fronts of his Circus. From here, Brock Street leads to perhaps the greatest glory of Georgian Bath, John Wood the Younger's magnificent, golden-stoned curved terrace of the Royal Crescent. </p> <p>\u0095 Recommended tea shop: Sally Lunn's House, Lilliput Alley, Bath. Further information and map from: Bath Tourist Information Centre, Abbey Chambers, Abbey Church Yard, Bath (Tel: 01225 477101) </p> <p><strong> Birmingham</strong><br> </p> <p>Birmingham has only recently rediscovered its canal heritage. At least six major canals come right into the heart of the city, the hub of which is the unglamorous-sounding Gas Street Basin off Broad Street, now a fashionable inner-city rendezvous, surrounded by modern red-brick and smoked-glass apartments and theme pubs. Here the Worcestershire &amp; Birmingham; Old Main Line; Birmingham &amp; Fazeley, and Warwick &amp; Birmingham (leading to the Grand Union - the M1 of its day) Canals all meet, and colourful narrowboats jostle for moorings in the shadow of Birmingham's re-invented West End. Apart from the miles of quiet canal walks which can be enjoyed in Birmingham, a short walk away from Gas Street is the city's famous Jewellery Quarter, where two trails marked by stainless steel information plaques set into the pavements have been laid out. The first starts from the Millennium Apartments and runs to British Telecom House, while a giant charm bracelet is the basis of the second starting from Sandpits Parade, with each \"charm\" revealing a new fact about the Jewellery Quarter, until you reach the Chamberlain Clock Tower near the Town Hall. </p> <p>\u0095 Recommended pub: for a traditional pint, try the Tap and Spile, Gas Street, Birmingham. For a leaflet describing the walks, contact the Central Library on 0121-303 4511, or the Birmingham Tourist Information Centre, 130, Colmore Row, Birmingham (Tel: 0121-693 6300). </p> <p><strong> Durham</strong><br> </p> <p>A short walk around the great Durham peninsula - formed by a hairpin loop of the River Wear - takes in most of the city's great buildings and shows the cathedral in its magnificent setting towering above the river. Start from the cobbled Market Place, which is overlooked by the Guildhall and Town Hall, and ascend the mainly Tudor Saddler Street, which leads up to the open space of Palace Green and the imposing sight of the northern side of the 12th-century cathedral. In the right-hand corner of the Green, a cobbled lane leads to Durham Castle, which now doubles as University College, Durham, and is open for guided tours. </p> <p>After exploring the cathedral and castle, turn right down Dun Cow Lane to the North Bailey and back into Saddler Street. Turn right down the Magdalen Steps on to the Souterpath, which leads down on to the Riverside Walk, which is followed for about a mile and a half through pleasant woodland around the great peninsula. You pass the modern Kingsgate Bridge and The Last Supper, a wooden sculpture by Colin Wilbourn, before reaching Prebend's Bridge and the classic view of the triple towers of the cathedral across the weir of the Old Fulling Mill, now the city's Museum of Archaeology. Cross the bridge and turn left under the cathedral to the 12th-century Framwellgate Bridge, where you ascend the steps to return to the Market Place. </p> <p>\u0095 Recommended tea shop: Vennell's in Saddlers' Yard, off Saddler Street.

Turn left up North Hanover Street and then right into Cathedral Street for the long climb up to the rather gloomy 12th-century St Mungo's Cathedral, the city's patron saint. Nearby is Provands' Lordship, the oldest house in Glasgow, built in 1471 and now a museum, and the St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, worth a visit if only to see Dali's Christ of St John of the Cross. </p> <p>Turn left from the cathedral and walk down the High Street until you reach the distinctive clock tower of the Tolbooth Steeple, built in 1626. Turn right along Trongate and Argyle Street, Glasgow's main shopping streets, then right into Buchanan Street and into fashionable Prince's Square arcade. Turn left into Gordon Street and then right into West Nile Street which eventually reaches the famous thoroughfare of Sauchiehall Street. Turn left here and, after a few yards, you pass a black-and white-painted shop bearing the sign Henderson's the Jewellers. The ground floor is a jewellers, but upstairs is the Willow Tea Rooms, one of the finest examples of the work of Glasgow's art deco architectural genius, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. </p> <p>Shortly after leaving the Willow Tea Rooms, turn right into Dalhouse Street to take in Macintosh's tour de force, the tall, elegant structure of the Glasgow School of Art in Renfrew Street (guided tours available). Return to George Square the way you came via West Nile Street and Vincent Street </p> <p>\u0095 Recommended tea shop: Willow Tea Rooms, Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow.

Flanking the market are the 15th-century but much-restored Guildhall, the 200ft white concrete monolith of the City Hall, opened in 1938, and St Peter Mancroft, one of Norwich's collection of fine medieval churches which reflect its past importance. </p> <p>North up Dove Street is St John's Maddermarket, another fine church, the Maddermarket Theatre and Strangers' Hall, a rambling 16th-century mansion said to be named after Flemish weavers. Turn right down St Andrew Street past St Andrews Church and, in Bridewell Alley on the left, The Bridewell Museum, devoted to the traditional life of Norfolk and The Mustard Shop. </p> <p>Bear left into Princes Street and immediately left again into cobbled Elm Hill - a riot of colour-washed Tudor houses that lead down into Wensum Street, where you turn right into the grim-sounding Tombland (from the Saxon \"toom\", which meant an open market). This mainly Georgian street leads to the 15th-century Erpingham Gate on the left and into the tranquility of Cathedral Close. Caen-stoned Norwich Cathedral is a masterpiece of Norman architecture </p> <p>Back into Tombland, turn left into Upper King Street to reach the tree-moated Norwich Castle, standing on a motte first erected in the 12th century.

This leads into the famous Shambles, with its cobbles and leaning, half-timbered gables which almost touch overhead. </p> <p>The Shambles leads into Newgate Market and the Pavement and into Coppergate, the Jorvik Centre and St Mary's Castlegate, which is now the setting for a museum telling the York Story. </p> <p>Castlegate leads towards Clifford's Tower, a classic motte put up just two years after the Norman Conquest to subdue the northern English and now topped by a stone keep dating from 1270, with fine views across the city.

Yet this is a radical announcement of individuality: she may be acting according to fashion but there's nothing bland about her hair piled up like a brioche, her downcast eyes, her strong face.

You may be a trainee ski instructor who needs to pass a \"time test\" through gates. You may be a ski bum who enters the weekly bar race; or you may simply be a holidaymaker who has an occasional run in one of the \"pay to race\" schemes, such as Nastar in North America or WISBI in Austria. </p> <p>What you'll immediately notice is that there is a world of difference between free skiing, where you can choose when to turn, and ski-racing, where the location of your turns is dictated to you. </p> <p><strong>Ski-racing </strong>(sometimes called \"alpine skiing\" to distinguish it from the \"nordic events\" of cross-country and ski-jumping) is divided into four distinct \"disciplines\": slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom, and downhill. All four consist of making turns of differing sizes through a series of gates, against the clock. Parallel slalom requires two skiers to race head-to-head down two identical courses, alongside each other. There is also a separate discipline called speed skiing, which consists of a totally straight course without turns. This requires much less skill than the four other disciplines, because turning is the hardest part of racing, but plenty of courage; even at the events open to normal holidaymakers in Les Arcs, it's possible to reach 100mph. </p> <p><strong>Slalom</strong> has the lowest speed of the four disciplines, but it's also where things happen the quickest, as you have to weave through the tight gates in a very rapid rhythm. A fully fledged course consists of two blue poles, followed by two reds, followed by two blues, etc. Each pair makes up a \"gate\". The rules state that your ski-tips and boots need to pass through each gate. </p> <p>To ski slalom, you need to have mastered all the attributes of short turns in free skiing: rhythmic pole-plants, upper body facing down the hill, feet turning beneath you, short sharp bursts of edging. But you also need to deal with the poles. Good racers use \"cross-blocking\", where their feet get so close to the base of the pole that their entire upper body actually passes inside the line of the pole, because their speed imparts a certain amount of inward lean. They then punch the pole out of the way with their outside hand - modern poles are hinged, and bend over easily to allow the racer to pass. The less ambitious option is to ski around the pole with your whole body. The advent of ultra-short, curvy-shaped slalom skis in the past year has transformed slalom technique. No longer do racers pivot their skis between edge sets - they now carve round arcs through each turn. </p> <p><strong>Giant slalom</strong>, or GS, is the discipline you're most likely to encounter.This is the most accessible to non-racers, but at the top level it's also seen as the purest test of technique. The gates are similar to slalom but more widely spaced, allowing higher speeds. Each \"pole\" actually consists of two poles about a metre apart, with a \"panel\" of cloth stretched between them - this makes \"cross-blocking\" impossible, as you'd catch your head on the panel. You need to ski around the panel with your whole body, stretching your inside arm forward to deflect the pole. In GS, the \"line\" is crucial; you need to start each turn well before each gate. As you pass the panel, your skis should already be pointing towards the next gate. Your track should be a series of smooth arcs, more like an \"S\" than a \"Z\". To carry speed, you need to carve your turns, with plenty of hip angulation. Slalom and GS are called the \"technical events\" and usually consist of two runs, with both times added together. </p> <p><strong>Super giant slalom</strong>, or super G, is a higher-speed version of GS, with wider-spaced gates. It consists of just one run. </p> <p><strong>Downhill</strong> is the glamour event of skiing. Speeds reach 90mph, and racers have to negotiate turns, jumps, compressions (where the G-forces squash them downwards) and fast straight schusses, all over a two-mile course. A race usually consists of one run, occasionally two when the course is shortened due to bad weather. </p> <p>Downhill and super G are known as the \"speed events\". Both require good turning technique, like the technical events, but also a low aerodynamic squat, called the \"tuck\". </p> <p>I'd recommend wearing a helmet for all racing and there are specialised race skis for all four disciplines.

      "body": "<p>Word has got round the cow community recently; if you're feeling a little bit under the weather, you're best avoiding the vet's for a while. It all started when a cow popped into open surgery and told the vet she had a slight sniffle.</p> <p>\"Hmm...\" said the vet, writing out a prescription, \"well, it's not a life threatening illness or anything...\"</p> <p>\"So what do you recommend?\" asked the cow. \"Shall I take an aspirin and go to bed?\"</p> <p>\"Well, to be on the safe side I'm prescribing mass slaughter for you and all your family...\"</p> <p>\"Oh. Er, actually do you know what? I suddenly feel a lot better.\"</p> <p>\"... And if you could give me a list of all your sheep and pig friends as well, we'd better slaughter them too.\"</p> <p>\"No really, I feel great. I think I might run the London marathon.\"</p> <p>Suddenly we are told that the foot and mouth epidemic is now worse than the crisis of 1967. And then everyone nods and says: \"Really?\" pretending they knew there'd been a similar crisis 34 years ago (while a vague memory stirs of an edition of the Rock and Roll Years which featured black and white footage of some sick-looking sheep to the opening chords of A Whiter Shade of Pale).</p> <p>Politicians about to lose an election call for the election to be postponed. A march for the right of country folk to kill animals is cancelled and instead the farmers stay at home and weep because they're having to kill animals. Finally the situation has the hallmark of any great national crisis; they've called in the army. The lads have been in training for this, but now it's the real thing. Collecting dead sheep. We all remember the Royal Tournament when we were kids; how quickly the Parachute Regiment could rush into the arena, dig a hole and chuck in a load of sheep carcasses. Well now we are going to see them in action for real.</p> <p>\"Great news lads! We're leaving Belfast.\"</p> <p>\"Hooray! At last, scuba diving in Bermuda like the advert promised.\"</p> <p>\"Er, nearly. Trudging around wet fields, picking up rotting sheep carcasses.\"</p> <p>We are assured that the army will not be doing any shooting, but we're always told this when our soldiers are sent into a crisis. It will be just like Bosnia; they'll go into the Cumbrian hills not intending to get caught up in the fighting but soon it'll become impossible not to take sides.

      "bodyText": "Word has got round the cow community recently; if you're feeling a little bit under the weather, you're best avoiding the vet's for a while. It all started when a cow popped into open surgery and told the vet she had a slight sniffle. \"Hmm...\" said the vet, writing out a prescription, \"well, it's not a life threatening illness or anything...\" \"So what do you recommend?\" asked the cow. \"Shall I take an aspirin and go to bed?\" \"Well, to be on the safe side I'm prescribing mass slaughter for you and all your family...\" \"Oh. Er, actually do you know what? I suddenly feel a lot better.\" \"... And if you could give me a list of all your sheep and pig friends as well, we'd better slaughter them too.\" \"No really, I feel great. I think I might run the London marathon.\" Suddenly we are told that the foot and mouth epidemic is now worse than the crisis of 1967. And then everyone nods and says: \"Really?\" pretending they knew there'd been a similar crisis 34 years ago (while a vague memory stirs of an edition of the Rock and Roll Years which featured black and white footage of some sick-looking sheep to the opening chords of A Whiter Shade of Pale). Politicians about to lose an election call for the election to be postponed. A march for the right of country folk to kill animals is cancelled and instead the farmers stay at home and weep because they're having to kill animals. Finally the situation has the hallmark of any great national crisis; they've called in the army. The lads have been in training for this, but now it's the real thing. Collecting dead sheep. We all remember the Royal Tournament when we were kids; how quickly the Parachute Regiment could rush into the arena, dig a hole and chuck in a load of sheep carcasses. Well now we are going to see them in action for real. \"Great news lads! We're leaving Belfast.\" \"Hooray! At last, scuba diving in Bermuda like the advert promised.\" \"Er, nearly. Trudging around wet fields, picking up rotting sheep carcasses.\" We are assured that the army will not be doing any shooting, but we're always told this when our soldiers are sent into a crisis. It will be just like Bosnia; they'll go into the Cumbrian hills not intending to get caught up in the fighting but soon it'll become impossible not to take sides. Once militant sheep factions start reprisals on the farmers, pressure will mount for British soldiers to intervene. You might presume that a flock of sheep would be no match for the British army, but these things are never quite so straightforward. The farm animals know the terrain better than the squaddies flown in from Aldershot, and like any well drilled military unit, the sheep tend not to think for themselves too much. And what the animals lack in military hardware and discipline they make up for in numbers. It'll be like Zulu! only this time it's Sheep! \"There's bloody thousands of them, Sah!\" the sergeant major will exclaim as he scans the horizon. Regimental goats will be unmasked as spies for the other side. The Sun will describe the enemy as \"no better than animals\". But eventually, British determination and military know-how will win through; the livestock will be overwhelmed, and a new spirit of species patriotism will prevail. Of course the moaning minnies will say that using depleted uranium has made the farms uninhabitable and there'll be rumours that some of the Welsh guards were fraternising with the enemy. But no one will want to listen to negative propaganda at a time of such national pride, when the prime minister's approval rating is breaking all records. The foot and mouth crisis should not be misconstrued as an electoral problem for the government. By demanding the army be called in, William Hague has played right into the PM's hands. The one remaining piece of the jigsaw that needed to be in place before the general election was a historic triumph for the British armed services. Maggie saw off the Argentine navy; Tony Blair could seize this opportunity and secure a heroic victory over wheezy farm animals.

Cue a walkover for Labour at the general election called immediately afterwards (though Hague remains leader as he is the only Conservative MP left).

We will, of course, be more than happy to pay council tax the moment the British government returns to us, with interest, all the land and money it nicked in the 16th century.\"</p> <p>I was sorry to see that Cranley Onslow, the former chairman of the Tory 1922 committee, has recently died, though my regret was tempered by the fact that he came closer than any other MP to driving me out of business. It began years ago, when I was writing a political column in the old Punch magazine. Onslow came storming into a bar to demand of my then boss, the Guardian political editor Ian Aitken, whether it was true that his nickname among the press was \"Crapley Onslow\". Ian, taken aback, hesitated, then said, no it wasn't. The correct version was, ahem, \"Crapley Arsehole\".</p> <p>Short of material - and why else does one put anything into a column? - I sent this in to Punch. Onslow went berserk. He wrote to the parliamentary press gallery, which represents the journalists who work in the Commons, and demanded my banishment for bringing parliament into disrepute and contempt. My colleagues read the letter and immediately moved next business. There are times when I heartily approve of self-regulation.</p> <p>But he did not give up, and briefed lawyers. Julian Critchley warned me that he was very determined, and that I should take his threats seriously. So I spent a morning going through the data base - shoe boxes full of clippings - assembled by the brilliant Parliamentary Profiles writer, Andrew Roth. Here I found just what I was looking for, and the following week Punch printed my favourite apology. First I grovelled to Onslow - grave distress caused to himself and his family, etc, quite inappropriate to compare an MP to a bodily part, especially that bodily part, and so on. In the next paragraph I was able to write: \"Am I alone in regretting the passing of the grand old days of parliamentary invective? It was fully four years ago that Cranley Onslow publicly described Brian Sedgemore MP as 'the boil on the bottom of the Labour party; painful if sat upon, but best ignored' ....\" I heard nothing more from him, or his lawyers.</p> <p>Terror struck me at the party held for the new book by Carole Stone, the celebrated Networking. As you might expect the launch was full of quite famous people, including Lord and Lady Birt, Sue MacGregor, bruising home office minister Charles Clarke, tipped as a future Labour leader, and Maureen Lipman, who's lovely. Some readers might recall that last week I was rude about Esther Rantzen, who was supposed to be used by the Royal Opera House to drum up support for a rather difficult modern opera that's on now. I made the point that I would refuse free dress circle tickets to Cosi Fan Tutti or Madame Butterfly if I thought she might be in the audience.</p> <p>So imagine my horror when a voice said, \"hello, Simon, did you go to the opera?\", spoken by a face which was, for one nano-second, only vaguely familiar, then resolved itself in my fuddled brain as the Queen of Willie-shaped Vegetables herself. \"No!\" I managed to croak, before running to find sanctuary with someone much less famous, but safer.</p> <p>Now and again silly people claim this is not a class-based society. Then you read something which proves otherwise. This week we learned that Tesco has discovered that some people are embarrassed to have their vans drive up to their doors, and are testing the idea of having dark green Range Rovers do the deliveries instead. These prestigious vehicles will have a tiny, discreet Tesco badge somewhere on the bodywork.</p> <p>The scheme is being rolled-out, as we say, in Norfolk, which is now one of our poshest counties, being full of wealthy people who buy property in the idyllic villages to the north and on the coast, and who frequent elegantly restored pubs in which men in Barbours and cord trousers offer guest ales and main courses of partridge and polenta.</p> <p>I like the idea of the discreet badge. Presumably snoopy neighbours will use binoculars to detect it. But what Tesco's don't realise is that worrying about their vans is a very Hyacinth Bucket version of gentility. Proper toffs are obsessed with saving money and are quite happy for everyone to know it. Genuine nobs would demand that their groceries were delivered in a filthy white van marked \"Ee-Zee-Save - food-style substances at lo lo prices\" The nosey neighbours would be able to discern a small, discreet badge marked: \"Fortnum &amp; Mason\".</p> <p>I had a really nice evening a week ago, on Red Nose Day, reading out the questions in the 10 Downing Street charity quiz. The press office had assumed that their table would romp home, but the questions (not chosen by me) had been cunningly devised to have something for everyone, including the table of very jolly people who staff the switchboard and open the mail, as well as the chaps and chapesses with Oxbridge firsts. There was also a killer round in which you had to guess where in the building were photos of certain little difficult things, such as door handles. It was all great fun, and somewhat boozy, and I realised that in spite of the address they were just another bunch of nice, smarter than average office workers, enjoying a few matey drinks.</p>",

My colleagues read the letter and immediately moved next business. There are times when I heartily approve of self-regulation. But he did not give up, and briefed lawyers. Julian Critchley warned me that he was very determined, and that I should take his threats seriously. So I spent a morning going through the data base - shoe boxes full of clippings - assembled by the brilliant Parliamentary Profiles writer, Andrew Roth. Here I found just what I was looking for, and the following week Punch printed my favourite apology. First I grovelled to Onslow - grave distress caused to himself and his family, etc, quite inappropriate to compare an MP to a bodily part, especially that bodily part, and so on. In the next paragraph I was able to write: \"Am I alone in regretting the passing of the grand old days of parliamentary invective? It was fully four years ago that Cranley Onslow publicly described Brian Sedgemore MP as 'the boil on the bottom of the Labour party; painful if sat upon, but best ignored' ....\" I heard nothing more from him, or his lawyers. Terror struck me at the party held for the new book by Carole Stone, the celebrated Networking. As you might expect the launch was full of quite famous people, including Lord and Lady Birt, Sue MacGregor, bruising home office minister Charles Clarke, tipped as a future Labour leader, and Maureen Lipman, who's lovely. Some readers might recall that last week I was rude about Esther Rantzen, who was supposed to be used by the Royal Opera House to drum up support for a rather difficult modern opera that's on now. I made the point that I would refuse free dress circle tickets to Cosi Fan Tutti or Madame Butterfly if I thought she might be in the audience. So imagine my horror when a voice said, \"hello, Simon, did you go to the opera?\", spoken by a face which was, for one nano-second, only vaguely familiar, then resolved itself in my fuddled brain as the Queen of Willie-shaped Vegetables herself. \"No!\" I managed to croak, before running to find sanctuary with someone much less famous, but safer. Now and again silly people claim this is not a class-based society. Then you read something which proves otherwise. This week we learned that Tesco has discovered that some people are embarrassed to have their vans drive up to their doors, and are testing the idea of having dark green Range Rovers do the deliveries instead. These prestigious vehicles will have a tiny, discreet Tesco badge somewhere on the bodywork. The scheme is being rolled-out, as we say, in Norfolk, which is now one of our poshest counties, being full of wealthy people who buy property in the idyllic villages to the north and on the coast, and who frequent elegantly restored pubs in which men in Barbours and cord trousers offer guest ales and main courses of partridge and polenta. I like the idea of the discreet badge. Presumably snoopy neighbours will use binoculars to detect it. But what Tesco's don't realise is that worrying about their vans is a very Hyacinth Bucket version of gentility. Proper toffs are obsessed with saving money and are quite happy for everyone to know it. Genuine nobs would demand that their groceries were delivered in a filthy white van marked \"Ee-Zee-Save - food-style substances at lo lo prices\" The nosey neighbours would be able to discern a small, discreet badge marked: \"Fortnum &amp; Mason\". I had a really nice evening a week ago, on Red Nose Day, reading out the questions in the 10 Downing Street charity quiz. The press office had assumed that their table would romp home, but the questions (not chosen by me) had been cunningly devised to have something for everyone, including the table of very jolly people who staff the switchboard and open the mail, as well as the chaps and chapesses with Oxbridge firsts. There was also a killer round in which you had to guess where in the building were photos of certain little difficult things, such as door handles. It was all great fun, and somewhat boozy, and I realised that in spite of the address they were just another bunch of nice, smarter than average office workers, enjoying a few matey drinks.",

His \u00a345,000 represented nine-tenths of a maximum \u00a350,000 while Ms Page's \u00a341,031 was three-tenths of the \u00a3136,769 due if she had achieved targets set when she took control. The dome board's approval of bonuses totalling \u00a3135,620 for five former directors reflected what a flop the project was. They would have been entitled to share \u00a3389,626 if it had lived up to the advance billing. The managing director, Liam Kane, was awarded \u00a331,559 of a possible \u00a394,677, the commercial director, Kevin Johnson, got \u00a38,768 of \u00a352,608 and the finance director, Steve Brown, got \u00a39,262 of \u00a355,572. Mr Kane, paid \u00a3150,000 a year during the 24 months he was in the post, immediately returned the bonus and asked for it to be donated to good causes supported by the millennium commission. The dome was a \u00a3800m disaster zone. David James, the City troubleshooter appointed NMEC chairman in the middle of last year to salvage the project, said he had beenlegally advised of contractural obligations to pay the bonuses. Mr James, who is still working unpaid to find a buyer for the Greenwich tent, paid tribute by name to Mr Gerbeau only. \"The contract for PY Gerbeau, chief executive from February 2000 to January 2001, carried a maximum bonus entitlement of \u00a350,000 measured against overall performance,\" he said. \"In making the award of 90% of the maximum entitlement the board recognised that PY had achieved a significant level of performance against his targets.\" Ms Page declined to comment, but a colleague said she believed she had never received the recognition she deserved for ensuring the dome opened on time. Although it had to be bailed out financially several times and little more than half the trumpeted 12m visitors turned up, Mr Gerbeau's enthusiasm prevented an even worse performance. The former Disneyland Paris executive said last night that he was \"still waiting for the letter\" confirming the bonus but viewed it as a vote of confidence in his performance. \"More important than the money is the recognition that I have done a good job,\" he said. \"The board recognises I achieved all my objectives.\" Peter Ainsworth, shadow culture secretary, said: \"Most people would expect bonuses to be paid out from the earnings of their success. \"Nobody could possibly imagine that the dome has been anything but a total failure. I have no doubt, however, that the people involved worked extremely hard, including the many people who are apparently receiving no additional bonus.\"",

At the same time a record 14,430 decisions on asylum cases in February helped to cut the backlog of asylum seekers waiting for an official answer to below 50,000 for the first time in seven years. The backlog of 49,690 outstanding asylum cases compares with more than 103,000 in January last year. The sharp fall in the backlog of asylum applicants over the past 12 months has taken some of the heat out of the party political debate over asylum as it reduces the pressures on south-east England. The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday insisted he would continue to maintain the pressure by making the return home of 30,000 failed asylum seekers, made up of 24,000 principal applicants and their families, the focus of official efforts over the next 12 months. \"The task of restoring integrity to the asylum system will not be complete until we can ensure that people whose claims are unfounded routinely leave Britain at the end of the consideration of their claims,\" said Mr Straw. He added that 700 new immigration staff had been recruited. The number of detention places is also being increased to 2,700 to ensure that failed asylum seekers do not disappear before they are deported. The official monthly asylum figures show that the highest number of asylum seekers came from Iraq (710), Afghanistan (615), Sri Lanka (435), Somalia (380), and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (375). People fleeing Iraq have topped the list of countries for the last three months. The 14,430 decisions taken last month is the highest number ever. About 22% of those whose cases were decided were told they could stay in Britain either with full refugee status or as a result of being granted exceptional leave to remain. A further 24% were refused asylum without full consideration of their case on technical \"non-compliance\" grounds, bringing the proportion refused refugee status after detailed consideration of their case down to about 50% of all applicants. The Conservative home affairs spokesman, David Lidington, however, claimed Labour had little to boast about. \"The figures show continuing chaos in our asylum system,\" he said.\"",

      "body": "<p>The initials on the ancient coat of arms salute the Prince of Peace. But around them has been built the legend of Proud Preston. And proud it remains even though it has come down in the municipal world. Thirty years ago it was a county borough with all the powers of a unitary authority. Preston police patrolled Preston streets and Preston schools educated Preston children.</p> <p>Then the idea of \"two tier\" local government came into fashion and the Redcliffe Maud commission recommended the demotion of the west Lancashire town. Preston's most important and most exciting services became the responsibility of the Lancashire county council.</p> <p>Back in 1974 there was at least the consolation of equality of suffering with Blackburn and Blackpool. But then, in 1996, when unitary authorities came back into favour, the two other towns became metropolitan boroughs. Preston did not. In the decaying but still imposing town hall there are three rival explanations for the humiliation. The first is lack of confidence combined with insularity. Preston was fearful about standing alone and unwilling to embrace the nearby boroughs of Chorley and South Fylde. The second is misplaced loyalty. Blackburn and Jack Straw, its MP, resisted both the pressure and persuasion of the county, but Preston's Labour leaders argued for \"standing by party colleagues\" whose authority would be emasculated by Preston's promotion. The third possibility was graphically expressed by a Labour councillor of long service and high reputation. \"Nobody in their right mind would have given more authority to Preston then. The council had been destroyed by crazy politics\".</p> <p>During the mid-nineties, the reputation of Preston borough council was severely injured by a deeply divided ruling Labour group led by Councillor Valerie Wise, daughter of Audrey, then the town's MP. During one council meeting, Joe Hood, the leader of the Conservative group, asked Ms Wise if she wanted to create the Socialist Republic of Preston. She replied that she did. Local newspapers photographed her on the Guildhall steps acting out the proclamation of the borough's new status.</p> <p><b> Communication failure</b><br></p> <p>The damage done by simple silliness was compounded by the impression of chaos created by the suspension of Geoffrey Driver, the council's chief executive. Driver, now a Preston Conservative councillor, says that the only reason he was given for his suspension was \"a failure to communicate\" with his leader. He interprets that accusation as meaning that he rejected Ms Wise's view that he must not to communicate with anyone else. Ms Wise says that, after taking legal advice, she judged that her action was justified on the grounds of the chief executive's \"incompetency\" - unwillingness or inability to implement the policies of the ruling Labour group.</p> <p>Wherever the blame lay, after a couple of months, the suspension lapsed and Driver made a formal return to duty. He then left the authority. As a councillor he now pursues questions of municipal probity with a well informed persistence that annoys his Tory colleagues almost as much as it irritates his Labour opponents.</p> <p>Whatever they think about him now, Driver's suspension and its consequences for public opinion was unacceptable to the ruling Labour group. The left/right split, which had secured Wise's election as leader, tilted against her and she was deposed. David Borrow, ousted by Ms Wise 18 months earlier, was reinstated. He remained in charge until he became MP for South Ribble two years later. Ian Hall, who now leads the council, has no doubt that for years the memory of the divided regime \"did very considerable damage to the reputations of the Labour party and the council in general.\"</p> <p>Damaging though the era was, the behaviour of the Labour group was not the only (or even the first) blemish to scar Preston's municipal reputation.</p> <p>A couple of years before Ms Wise was elected leader, Frank McGrath, the deputy Labour leader, was lent \u00a3125,000 by Balfour Beatty, the civil engineering company which was rebuilding Preston's inland dock. After a police investigation the director of public prosecutions decided not to prosecute Councillor McGrath. The council, believing that the \u00a3125,000 is a \"surplus on the cost of the dock rebuilding scheme\" is considering attempting to \"reclaim\" it through the civil courts.</p> <p>Add to all this confusion and division, the behaviour of four \"independent\" councillors (one of whom changed his party three times) and Preston became a perfect example of all that is popularly believed to be wrong with local government - the combination of circumstances that makes the efficient provision of services impossible. Peter Rankin, who took over the Labour leadership when David Borrow left for Westminster, told his colleagues that what went on in the town hall was \"more like a circus than a council\".</p> <p>Against that background of conspicuous absurdity it is quite extraordinary that, over recent years, Preston council has made giant leaps towards efficient and effective local government. Its total budget is only a fraction of Birmingham's \u00a32bn but that does not reduce the importance of spending with care. All the indicators of financial probity now confirm its commitment to prudent management. Spending committees are obliged to respect cash limits. Council house rents have been increased (by the full amount recommended by the Treasury) with the agreement of all the parties. After some argument, the notion that all spending must conform to the government's view of \"best value\" - the obligation to examine every item of expenditure and make sure that the money is not wasted - has been accepted. The town's \"balances\", on which it can rely in times of trouble, stand at \u00a34m.</p> <p>Despite the new fiscal probity, Preston still pays a financial price for standing in the shadow of the county council. For years Blackpool and Blackburn levied a lower council tax - once by as much as two pounds a week in Band D. The Tory group leader Kenneth Hudson has every reason to blame the discrepancy on local socialist profligacy but he holds the county council responsible. Preston's council tax includes a \"precept\" which it levies to finance services provided by the county. Hudson believes that it is kept unreasonably high by the cost of bureaucracy. \"After they lost Blackpool and Blackburn, they never thought of cutting down their administration\" even though they were providing services for, and raising money from, half a million fewer people. Whether or not that criticism is justified, it typifies the widespread resentment that is felt in the town. Preston is an ancient borough with buildings which almost match its traditions. It stands where the M6 and M55 meet and it is the west coast mainline station for all of central Lancashire. It is well managed and likely to expand. Yet it is not allowed to run the most vital local services.</p> <p>Rankin complains: \"The county is too remote. It is a nonsense that Preston is not running its own schools\". Since he must take some of the credit for the council's fiscal prudence he is entitled to complain about the wasteful duplication of services. Both town and county run information and welfare rights bureaux. When it was suggested that amalgamation was sensible, the county agreed. All that was necessary, they said, was for Preston to hand over its assets and responsibilities to the senior authority. Ian Hall, too loyal to criticise colleagues, takes a stand on principle. He \"thought that the whole county should be divided into seven unitary authorities when the changes were considered in 1996\". He thinks so still.</p> <p>As proof of its ability to run its own affairs, as well as confirmation that the town's best interests are higher on the council agenda than meaningless party dogma, all the parties have united to welcome Grosvenor Estate as partner in a scheme to regenerate the central area - a plan which any of England's great cities would be glad to promote.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine Valerie Wise working happily with the Duke of Westminster. But during her last year on the council (when she was being rehabilitated in the chair of the Labour group) she was a member of the committee which examined the feasibility of the scheme. She concluded that \"partnership with the private sector is the only way to improve a very run down area\".</p> <p>Years of exposure to local government often encourage a growth in the practicality gene which lies dormant beneath the surface of all politicians. But the obligation to accept hard facts comes naturally to the best municipal leaders. Preston is now fortunate to have two such men leading the Labour and Conservative groups. Kenneth Hudson, a poultry farmer who first contested his rural ward as an independent, became leader of the Conservatives when Joe Hood (who had done the job for a quarter of a century) became mayor.</p> <p>Ian Hall, who led Labour in the early eighties, returned to office in 1999 when Rankin, the head of the careers advisory service in the University of Central Lancashire, decided that he could not risk his job for the uncertainties of leading a hung council in which his 27 Labour supporters were outnumbered by 29 Liberals, Conservatives and independents. Both Hudson and Hall are archetypal town hall figures and, even in their seventies, the spirit of service still obviously burns bright within them. Each of them also illustrates the difficulty of governing a \"lower tier\" council.</p> <p>Hudson spends three full days a week on council business. He has \"two men to help\" on his farm but \"works most days before council work starts and after it finishes\". He entered local politics because he thought that the village in which he lived was being neglected. \"The council barely knew it existed\". He has stayed for almost a quarter of a century because he has \"a mission to represent the rural areas which often miss out\". Hall came into local government after being active in his union which \"encouraged service and socialism\". He led the council back in the eighties, but gave up because he was \"in full time employment and the pressure was too great for anyone with a job\". Both men are now able to serve the town well not despite their age, but because of it.</p> <p>In larger authorities, leaders are paid an executive salary. Hall receives \u00a31,000 a year for doing what, since he does it properly, absorbs his whole week. Hudson receives (on application and proof of attendance) the backbench councillors' allowance when he attends a meeting. In consequence, neither man is likely to be replaced by a councillor in permanent employment. Rankin, who anticipated the introduction of the cabinet system to Preston, says that the local government reforms \"will make leading the council a full time job\". Preston is going through the pilot stage of cabinet government. When the new constitution is confirmed, the council leadership will no longer be open only to men and women who are retired, self-employed, out of work or willing to sacrifice success and promotion in their primary occupation. It will become a job for a professional politician.</p> <p>According to Hudson, \"almost every councillor hates the cabinet system\". Their complaint is that the rank and file are excluded from the consideration of policy. Rankin argues that \"cabinets get things done\" and avoid the hours wasted on unproductive discussion in committees and full council meetings. Hall, himself an enthusiast for the cabinet system, admits that there is \"a good deal of feeling in the Labour group about it. Some of them say that they feel totally isolated. That may be partly true. But the process makes decision-making easier\".</p> <p>The new regime means that the cabinet can only be examined on subjects which do not appear in their report if \"notice\" has been given of the question. Hudson says that during the one council meeting at which the new standing orders applied: \"We spent most of our time being told to sit down\". It was often the informality of the old councils which made them at least seem accountable to their constituents. The new regime is intended to improve the workings of democracy by separating the executive from the rest of the council. Few people in Preston believe the cabinet system will produce the desired result.</p> <p><b> Bus experience</b><br></p> <p>Hall's enthusiasm for the government's white paper reforms is less concerned with accountability than with efficiency. He is immensely influenced, in his support for change, by his experience as a director of Preston Bus, a company set up when deregulation ended the municipal monopoly of transport companies. A few years after the law was changed, a local competitor bought half a dozen mini-buses and set up a cheap shuttle service. \"In three weeks, Preston Bus had bought mini-buses of its own and the service was up and running. It would have taken the old council-owned company weeks. Meeting after meeting.\"</p> <p>Hall - \"basically New Labour\", although he has been around for 30 years - repeats the reality of the local government white paper. The committee system was the chimera of democracy. \"Decisions were always taken by the ruling political groups and that is still fundamentally the case\". But party discipline may soon break down. After the pilot period is over, Preston will be expected to observe national guidelines for the conduct of its cabinet. One of them requires a public statement of all outside influences on cabinet decisions. An announcement, \"as instructed by the Labour government\", will damage both dignity and popularity.</p> <p>Detaching the parties from the cabinets is part of New Labour's determination to make local government less political. On the evidence of Preston the cabinet system may not achieve that aim. The Conservatives, despite their instinct for consensus, prefer a one party administration. \"It's what the opposition wanted\", says Hall. There was a time when, had they wished it, the Tories could have formed a coalition with the Liberals. But when the numbers were right, the Liberal group included one councillor who, according to the Conservatives, \"did not work in the borough's best interests\". So they sacrificed the prospects of power. National policy on local government has to accommodate attitudes which Westminster finds difficult to understand.</p> <p>Fortunately for democracy, the great enterprise to which Preston set its hand together with the Grosvenor Estate enjoyed the support of all the council's parties. The \"media fact sheet\" which publicised the Tithebarn Redevelopment feasibility study, began with endorsements from the Tories and Liberals as well as Hall. Bill Chadwick, the engaging Liberal Leader, says that he would still prefer more houses and flats to be mixed in with the shops, markets, cafes and cinemas that make up the present proposals. But he is not the man to oppose the scheme which commands such general support.</p> <p>Liberals are never the same in any two local authorities. In Preston, after the Tories turned them down, they abandoned hope of coalition power because their growing ranks are often swelled by gains from Labour. Instead, they talk of a rainbow coalition of all the parties - knowing it to be unattainable - and allow the Labour minority to remain in power. With the justification which comes from inertia in the face of progress, Liberals will claim some credit for the city centre regeneration. It is a scheme which, as Hall, partly as an admission and partly as a boast, agrees: \"No council would have thought was within its remit 30 years ago.\"</p> <p>Hall, although a septuagenarian, moves with the times. He has joined the ranks of Labour leaders who want to divest their councils of the whole housing stock. In a sense, the government's conduct forced his hand. On the Callum estate, two thirds of the houses were repaired and improved under a government renovation programme. Then the scheme was abolished and Treasury funds for that sort of initiative dried up. \"There was no way in which the council itself could bring the remaining properties up to the standards\" which envious tenants knew were enjoyed by their more fortunate neighbours. <br><br>So the remaining houses were handed over to a housing association which the government allowed to raise the necessary capital. Hall is happy to see similar registered social landlords take over the remaining council estates. \"Nothing\" he says, \"is more trouble. Nine out of 10 complaints to councillors are about repairs\". He also has a less self-interested reason for welcoming the change. Free from borrowing restraint, \"RSLs will do a better job\". And, these days, councils have a different sort of regeneration on their minds. It is a process which they will only complete if they accept government restrictions on the way it is done.</p> <p>Sudden changes in Whitehall plans and regulations - invariably accompanied by the immediate end to the funding which originally accompanied them - are a major hazard of life in local government. The risk of being damaged by an unexpected policy shift is increased with every extension of government influenced over individual council decision. External control reduces the internal flexibility. Hall, for all his loyalty to the government, is becoming concerned about the extent of London interference. Like Rankin, his predecessor, he has fought for the acceptance and real operation of \"best value\". It was, he said, necessary to destroy \"Labour's reputation for throwing money away. No one would argue against the principle.\"</p> <p>However, he wonders if the system has grown unreasonably restrictive. \"Now we have inspectors to check that we're doing it in the right way. The bureaucracy is beginning to waste money not save it.\" He could not imagine \"a government of any persuasion ever allowing councils a free hand especially to raise money on the market\". Nor would he support total freedom. \"Past results prove that there have to be some controls.\" Working councillors fear that the central government's obsession with regulation is illustrated by its attitude towards Preston's estate improvement schemes.</p> <p>The Deepdale renewal strategy was launched in February 1997. To most people outside Preston, the name produces only the mental pictures of Tom Finney in long shorts, thick shin guards and heavy old fashioned boots making magical runs down the wing. To town planners it is an area of the town which qualified for designated renewal area status because immediate deprivation is combined with the prospect of improvement. And it met the government's other criteriaas 75% of its dwellings were privately owned. Rather more qualified for help under the 1989 Housing Act. A third of the resident households were entitled to state benefit. <br><br>So the council set out on an early exercise of combined public support and self-help. Housing grants were targeted at homes in greatest need and owner occupiers were advised both about the grants to which they were entitled and the way of raising private money for improvement. Businesses were encouraged to tidy up the appearance of their premises as a contribution to civic pride.</p> <p>The physical change were combined with a drive to convince the beneficiaries that the area belonged to them. They were asked what changes they most wanted to see and encouraged to come together in groups which spoke up for the whole community. Few councils, 10 years earlier, would have thought it right or necessary to provide a forum for dissent.</p> <p>These days councils rarely qualify for help, no matter how great their need, unless they can demonstrate that their proposals exactly meet the criteria of whoever provides the investment. The European Union is no less exacting than the Department of the Environment. Preston certainly qualifies for assistance from the European development fund. Eight of the town's wards are, as required under the scheme, amongst the 10% most deprived areas in the United Kingdom. <br><br>So what, in Euro jargon is called Objective II funding is available. The investment will have three purposes - the creation and development of small firms, the improvement of the economic infrastructure and the involvement of the local communities in partnership projects. More than \u00a37m is already promised for \"business and ideas\" and \"people and communities\" and \u00a310m from the strategic \"economic development\" fund is in prospect for the creation of an economic development zone.</p> <p><b> Big money</b><br></p> <p>For Preston, \u00a317m is big money. But to obtain it, a plethora of rules have to be observed and a litany of technical requirements met. It is wholly unreasonable to expect part-time councillors to master the detail. On the rare occasions when discretion can be exercised, the choices have to be made by technocrats. It is hardly surprising that Hudson, the Conservative leader, says: \"We are losing control of the nitty gritty of decisions. More and more is being delegated to officers. Soon there isn't going to be any democratic input\".</p> <p>The European Union has thought it right to make what, for the government, is the second straight trade off. Democracy has been sacrificed for efficiency. The same pattern of rules applies to almost all the government's regeneration initiatives, The neighbourhood renewal fund provides investment in deprived areas if, and only if, the recipient councils form a local strategic partnership which includes private companies and community groups. The partnership then has to agree a neighbourhood renewal strategy, produce a statement of how the strategy will employ the new funds, accept the performance targets set out by the government and prepare and acceptable best value performance plan. Preston council hopes to receive \u00a35m during the next four years. It does not expect to use much of its own initiative.</p> <p>Frustration at the death of democracy turns to anguish when new regulations require councils to do more, but fail to provide the extra funds. Preston provides the best concessionary fares scheme in the country.Some \u00a32m, a barely credible 10% of the whole council budget, is spent on the service. A few councils provide no travel concessions. Others only give minimal help to very limited categories of pensioners. The government has decided that a concessionary fares scheme of its own construction must be implemented throughout the country and has set down very clear rules of who must qualify for free travel. Preston councillors insist that their home-grown scheme will remain the most generous in England. But the new regulations will require them to offer concessions to people who did not receive them before. It will cost them \u00a3140,000 just to print and distribute the new passes which the new system will require. Although the extra expenditure is brought about by government action, there is no extra government money to fund it.</p> <p>All parties in Preston would have undoubtedly preferred to continue with their own scheme. But then, given the option, they would have chosen to go on raising and spending their own money with a freedom which they are not presently allowed. Hudson speaks for the whole council when he says: \"We got elected just the same as they do at Westminster. We should have the same rights to represent the people who voted for us\".

      "bodyText": "The initials on the ancient coat of arms salute the Prince of Peace. But around them has been built the legend of Proud Preston. And proud it remains even though it has come down in the municipal world. Thirty years ago it was a county borough with all the powers of a unitary authority. Preston police patrolled Preston streets and Preston schools educated Preston children. Then the idea of \"two tier\" local government came into fashion and the Redcliffe Maud commission recommended the demotion of the west Lancashire town. Preston's most important and most exciting services became the responsibility of the Lancashire county council. Back in 1974 there was at least the consolation of equality of suffering with Blackburn and Blackpool. But then, in 1996, when unitary authorities came back into favour, the two other towns became metropolitan boroughs. Preston did not. In the decaying but still imposing town hall there are three rival explanations for the humiliation. The first is lack of confidence combined with insularity. Preston was fearful about standing alone and unwilling to embrace the nearby boroughs of Chorley and South Fylde. The second is misplaced loyalty. Blackburn and Jack Straw, its MP, resisted both the pressure and persuasion of the county, but Preston's Labour leaders argued for \"standing by party colleagues\" whose authority would be emasculated by Preston's promotion. The third possibility was graphically expressed by a Labour councillor of long service and high reputation. \"Nobody in their right mind would have given more authority to Preston then. The council had been destroyed by crazy politics\". During the mid-nineties, the reputation of Preston borough council was severely injured by a deeply divided ruling Labour group led by Councillor Valerie Wise, daughter of Audrey, then the town's MP. During one council meeting, Joe Hood, the leader of the Conservative group, asked Ms Wise if she wanted to create the Socialist Republic of Preston. She replied that she did. Local newspapers photographed her on the Guildhall steps acting out the proclamation of the borough's new status. Communication failure The damage done by simple silliness was compounded by the impression of chaos created by the suspension of Geoffrey Driver, the council's chief executive. Driver, now a Preston Conservative councillor, says that the only reason he was given for his suspension was \"a failure to communicate\" with his leader. He interprets that accusation as meaning that he rejected Ms Wise's view that he must not to communicate with anyone else. Ms Wise says that, after taking legal advice, she judged that her action was justified on the grounds of the chief executive's \"incompetency\" - unwillingness or inability to implement the policies of the ruling Labour group. Wherever the blame lay, after a couple of months, the suspension lapsed and Driver made a formal return to duty. He then left the authority. As a councillor he now pursues questions of municipal probity with a well informed persistence that annoys his Tory colleagues almost as much as it irritates his Labour opponents. Whatever they think about him now, Driver's suspension and its consequences for public opinion was unacceptable to the ruling Labour group. The left/right split, which had secured Wise's election as leader, tilted against her and she was deposed. David Borrow, ousted by Ms Wise 18 months earlier, was reinstated. He remained in charge until he became MP for South Ribble two years later. Ian Hall, who now leads the council, has no doubt that for years the memory of the divided regime \"did very considerable damage to the reputations of the Labour party and the council in general.\" Damaging though the era was, the behaviour of the Labour group was not the only (or even the first) blemish to scar Preston's municipal reputation. A couple of years before Ms Wise was elected leader, Frank McGrath, the deputy Labour leader, was lent \u00a3125,000 by Balfour Beatty, the civil engineering company which was rebuilding Preston's inland dock. After a police investigation the director of public prosecutions decided not to prosecute Councillor McGrath. The council, believing that the \u00a3125,000 is a \"surplus on the cost of the dock rebuilding scheme\" is considering attempting to \"reclaim\" it through the civil courts. Add to all this confusion and division, the behaviour of four \"independent\" councillors (one of whom changed his party three times) and Preston became a perfect example of all that is popularly believed to be wrong with local government - the combination of circumstances that makes the efficient provision of services impossible. Peter Rankin, who took over the Labour leadership when David Borrow left for Westminster, told his colleagues that what went on in the town hall was \"more like a circus than a council\". Against that background of conspicuous absurdity it is quite extraordinary that, over recent years, Preston council has made giant leaps towards efficient and effective local government. Its total budget is only a fraction of Birmingham's \u00a32bn but that does not reduce the importance of spending with care. All the indicators of financial probity now confirm its commitment to prudent management. Spending committees are obliged to respect cash limits. Council house rents have been increased (by the full amount recommended by the Treasury) with the agreement of all the parties. After some argument, the notion that all spending must conform to the government's view of \"best value\" - the obligation to examine every item of expenditure and make sure that the money is not wasted - has been accepted. The town's \"balances\", on which it can rely in times of trouble, stand at \u00a34m. Despite the new fiscal probity, Preston still pays a financial price for standing in the shadow of the county council. For years Blackpool and Blackburn levied a lower council tax - once by as much as two pounds a week in Band D. The Tory group leader Kenneth Hudson has every reason to blame the discrepancy on local socialist profligacy but he holds the county council responsible. Preston's council tax includes a \"precept\" which it levies to finance services provided by the county. Hudson believes that it is kept unreasonably high by the cost of bureaucracy. \"After they lost Blackpool and Blackburn, they never thought of cutting down their administration\" even though they were providing services for, and raising money from, half a million fewer people. Whether or not that criticism is justified, it typifies the widespread resentment that is felt in the town. Preston is an ancient borough with buildings which almost match its traditions. It stands where the M6 and M55 meet and it is the west coast mainline station for all of central Lancashire. It is well managed and likely to expand. Yet it is not allowed to run the most vital local services. Rankin complains: \"The county is too remote. It is a nonsense that Preston is not running its own schools\". Since he must take some of the credit for the council's fiscal prudence he is entitled to complain about the wasteful duplication of services. Both town and county run information and welfare rights bureaux. When it was suggested that amalgamation was sensible, the county agreed. All that was necessary, they said, was for Preston to hand over its assets and responsibilities to the senior authority. Ian Hall, too loyal to criticise colleagues, takes a stand on principle. He \"thought that the whole county should be divided into seven unitary authorities when the changes were considered in 1996\". He thinks so still. As proof of its ability to run its own affairs, as well as confirmation that the town's best interests are higher on the council agenda than meaningless party dogma, all the parties have united to welcome Grosvenor Estate as partner in a scheme to regenerate the central area - a plan which any of England's great cities would be glad to promote. It is hard to imagine Valerie Wise working happily with the Duke of Westminster. But during her last year on the council (when she was being rehabilitated in the chair of the Labour group) she was a member of the committee which examined the feasibility of the scheme. She concluded that \"partnership with the private sector is the only way to improve a very run down area\". Years of exposure to local government often encourage a growth in the practicality gene which lies dormant beneath the surface of all politicians. But the obligation to accept hard facts comes naturally to the best municipal leaders. Preston is now fortunate to have two such men leading the Labour and Conservative groups. Kenneth Hudson, a poultry farmer who first contested his rural ward as an independent, became leader of the Conservatives when Joe Hood (who had done the job for a quarter of a century) became mayor. Ian Hall, who led Labour in the early eighties, returned to office in 1999 when Rankin, the head of the careers advisory service in the University of Central Lancashire, decided that he could not risk his job for the uncertainties of leading a hung council in which his 27 Labour supporters were outnumbered by 29 Liberals, Conservatives and independents. Both Hudson and Hall are archetypal town hall figures and, even in their seventies, the spirit of service still obviously burns bright within them. Each of them also illustrates the difficulty of governing a \"lower tier\" council. Hudson spends three full days a week on council business. He has \"two men to help\" on his farm but \"works most days before council work starts and after it finishes\". He entered local politics because he thought that the village in which he lived was being neglected. \"The council barely knew it existed\". He has stayed for almost a quarter of a century because he has \"a mission to represent the rural areas which often miss out\". Hall came into local government after being active in his union which \"encouraged service and socialism\". He led the council back in the eighties, but gave up because he was \"in full time employment and the pressure was too great for anyone with a job\". Both men are now able to serve the town well not despite their age, but because of it. In larger authorities, leaders are paid an executive salary. Hall receives \u00a31,000 a year for doing what, since he does it properly, absorbs his whole week. Hudson receives (on application and proof of attendance) the backbench councillors' allowance when he attends a meeting. In consequence, neither man is likely to be replaced by a councillor in permanent employment. Rankin, who anticipated the introduction of the cabinet system to Preston, says that the local government reforms \"will make leading the council a full time job\". Preston is going through the pilot stage of cabinet government. When the new constitution is confirmed, the council leadership will no longer be open only to men and women who are retired, self-employed, out of work or willing to sacrifice success and promotion in their primary occupation. It will become a job for a professional politician. According to Hudson, \"almost every councillor hates the cabinet system\". Their complaint is that the rank and file are excluded from the consideration of policy. Rankin argues that \"cabinets get things done\" and avoid the hours wasted on unproductive discussion in committees and full council meetings. Hall, himself an enthusiast for the cabinet system, admits that there is \"a good deal of feeling in the Labour group about it. Some of them say that they feel totally isolated. That may be partly true. But the process makes decision-making easier\". The new regime means that the cabinet can only be examined on subjects which do not appear in their report if \"notice\" has been given of the question. Hudson says that during the one council meeting at which the new standing orders applied: \"We spent most of our time being told to sit down\". It was often the informality of the old councils which made them at least seem accountable to their constituents. The new regime is intended to improve the workings of democracy by separating the executive from the rest of the council. Few people in Preston believe the cabinet system will produce the desired result. Bus experience Hall's enthusiasm for the government's white paper reforms is less concerned with accountability than with efficiency. He is immensely influenced, in his support for change, by his experience as a director of Preston Bus, a company set up when deregulation ended the municipal monopoly of transport companies. A few years after the law was changed, a local competitor bought half a dozen mini-buses and set up a cheap shuttle service. \"In three weeks, Preston Bus had bought mini-buses of its own and the service was up and running. It would have taken the old council-owned company weeks. Meeting after meeting.\" Hall - \"basically New Labour\", although he has been around for 30 years - repeats the reality of the local government white paper. The committee system was the chimera of democracy. \"Decisions were always taken by the ruling political groups and that is still fundamentally the case\". But party discipline may soon break down. After the pilot period is over, Preston will be expected to observe national guidelines for the conduct of its cabinet. One of them requires a public statement of all outside influences on cabinet decisions. An announcement, \"as instructed by the Labour government\", will damage both dignity and popularity. Detaching the parties from the cabinets is part of New Labour's determination to make local government less political. On the evidence of Preston the cabinet system may not achieve that aim. The Conservatives, despite their instinct for consensus, prefer a one party administration. \"It's what the opposition wanted\", says Hall. There was a time when, had they wished it, the Tories could have formed a coalition with the Liberals. But when the numbers were right, the Liberal group included one councillor who, according to the Conservatives, \"did not work in the borough's best interests\". So they sacrificed the prospects of power. National policy on local government has to accommodate attitudes which Westminster finds difficult to understand. Fortunately for democracy, the great enterprise to which Preston set its hand together with the Grosvenor Estate enjoyed the support of all the council's parties. The \"media fact sheet\" which publicised the Tithebarn Redevelopment feasibility study, began with endorsements from the Tories and Liberals as well as Hall. Bill Chadwick, the engaging Liberal Leader, says that he would still prefer more houses and flats to be mixed in with the shops, markets, cafes and cinemas that make up the present proposals. But he is not the man to oppose the scheme which commands such general support. Liberals are never the same in any two local authorities. In Preston, after the Tories turned them down, they abandoned hope of coalition power because their growing ranks are often swelled by gains from Labour. Instead, they talk of a rainbow coalition of all the parties - knowing it to be unattainable - and allow the Labour minority to remain in power. With the justification which comes from inertia in the face of progress, Liberals will claim some credit for the city centre regeneration. It is a scheme which, as Hall, partly as an admission and partly as a boast, agrees: \"No council would have thought was within its remit 30 years ago.\" Hall, although a septuagenarian, moves with the times. He has joined the ranks of Labour leaders who want to divest their councils of the whole housing stock. In a sense, the government's conduct forced his hand. On the Callum estate, two thirds of the houses were repaired and improved under a government renovation programme. Then the scheme was abolished and Treasury funds for that sort of initiative dried up. \"There was no way in which the council itself could bring the remaining properties up to the standards\" which envious tenants knew were enjoyed by their more fortunate neighbours. So the remaining houses were handed over to a housing association which the government allowed to raise the necessary capital. Hall is happy to see similar registered social landlords take over the remaining council estates. \"Nothing\" he says, \"is more trouble. Nine out of 10 complaints to councillors are about repairs\". He also has a less self-interested reason for welcoming the change. Free from borrowing restraint, \"RSLs will do a better job\". And, these days, councils have a different sort of regeneration on their minds. It is a process which they will only complete if they accept government restrictions on the way it is done. Sudden changes in Whitehall plans and regulations - invariably accompanied by the immediate end to the funding which originally accompanied them - are a major hazard of life in local government. The risk of being damaged by an unexpected policy shift is increased with every extension of government influenced over individual council decision. External control reduces the internal flexibility. Hall, for all his loyalty to the government, is becoming concerned about the extent of London interference. Like Rankin, his predecessor, he has fought for the acceptance and real operation of \"best value\". It was, he said, necessary to destroy \"Labour's reputation for throwing money away. No one would argue against the principle.\" However, he wonders if the system has grown unreasonably restrictive. \"Now we have inspectors to check that we're doing it in the right way. The bureaucracy is beginning to waste money not save it.\" He could not imagine \"a government of any persuasion ever allowing councils a free hand especially to raise money on the market\". Nor would he support total freedom. \"Past results prove that there have to be some controls.\" Working councillors fear that the central government's obsession with regulation is illustrated by its attitude towards Preston's estate improvement schemes. The Deepdale renewal strategy was launched in February 1997. To most people outside Preston, the name produces only the mental pictures of Tom Finney in long shorts, thick shin guards and heavy old fashioned boots making magical runs down the wing. To town planners it is an area of the town which qualified for designated renewal area status because immediate deprivation is combined with the prospect of improvement. And it met the government's other criteriaas 75% of its dwellings were privately owned. Rather more qualified for help under the 1989 Housing Act. A third of the resident households were entitled to state benefit. So the council set out on an early exercise of combined public support and self-help. Housing grants were targeted at homes in greatest need and owner occupiers were advised both about the grants to which they were entitled and the way of raising private money for improvement. Businesses were encouraged to tidy up the appearance of their premises as a contribution to civic pride. The physical change were combined with a drive to convince the beneficiaries that the area belonged to them. They were asked what changes they most wanted to see and encouraged to come together in groups which spoke up for the whole community. Few councils, 10 years earlier, would have thought it right or necessary to provide a forum for dissent. These days councils rarely qualify for help, no matter how great their need, unless they can demonstrate that their proposals exactly meet the criteria of whoever provides the investment. The European Union is no less exacting than the Department of the Environment. Preston certainly qualifies for assistance from the European development fund. Eight of the town's wards are, as required under the scheme, amongst the 10% most deprived areas in the United Kingdom. So what, in Euro jargon is called Objective II funding is available. The investment will have three purposes - the creation and development of small firms, the improvement of the economic infrastructure and the involvement of the local communities in partnership projects. More than \u00a37m is already promised for \"business and ideas\" and \"people and communities\" and \u00a310m from the strategic \"economic development\" fund is in prospect for the creation of an economic development zone. Big money For Preston, \u00a317m is big money. But to obtain it, a plethora of rules have to be observed and a litany of technical requirements met. It is wholly unreasonable to expect part-time councillors to master the detail. On the rare occasions when discretion can be exercised, the choices have to be made by technocrats. It is hardly surprising that Hudson, the Conservative leader, says: \"We are losing control of the nitty gritty of decisions. More and more is being delegated to officers. Soon there isn't going to be any democratic input\". The European Union has thought it right to make what, for the government, is the second straight trade off. Democracy has been sacrificed for efficiency. The same pattern of rules applies to almost all the government's regeneration initiatives, The neighbourhood renewal fund provides investment in deprived areas if, and only if, the recipient councils form a local strategic partnership which includes private companies and community groups. The partnership then has to agree a neighbourhood renewal strategy, produce a statement of how the strategy will employ the new funds, accept the performance targets set out by the government and prepare and acceptable best value performance plan. Preston council hopes to receive \u00a35m during the next four years. It does not expect to use much of its own initiative. Frustration at the death of democracy turns to anguish when new regulations require councils to do more, but fail to provide the extra funds. Preston provides the best concessionary fares scheme in the country.Some \u00a32m, a barely credible 10% of the whole council budget, is spent on the service. A few councils provide no travel concessions. Others only give minimal help to very limited categories of pensioners. The government has decided that a concessionary fares scheme of its own construction must be implemented throughout the country and has set down very clear rules of who must qualify for free travel. Preston councillors insist that their home-grown scheme will remain the most generous in England. But the new regulations will require them to offer concessions to people who did not receive them before. It will cost them \u00a3140,000 just to print and distribute the new passes which the new system will require. Although the extra expenditure is brought about by government action, there is no extra government money to fund it. All parties in Preston would have undoubtedly preferred to continue with their own scheme. But then, given the option, they would have chosen to go on raising and spending their own money with a freedom which they are not presently allowed. Hudson speaks for the whole council when he says: \"We got elected just the same as they do at Westminster. We should have the same rights to represent the people who voted for us\". His constitutional theory is less than perfect. Local government derives its powers from, and therefore is legally subservient to, parliament. But the spirit of his complaint typifies thousands of councillors throughout the country. Local government is not what it was when Joe Chamberlain - without consulting anyone except the Birmingham electorate - bought the town gasworks and the water company and used the profits from heat and light to rebuild the sewers.

      "bodyText": "Plans to erect a statue in the Palace of Westminster of Margaret Thatcher, complete with her trademark handbag, have run into opposition because the former prime minister is still alive. Margaret Beckett, leader of House of Commons, has made it clear she will refuse to allow the larger than life tribute to be displayed until after Lady Thatcher's death. Tony Banks, Labour chairman of the Commons committee which has already commissioned the \u00a350,000 marble image of the Iron Lady, wanted agreement to stand the sculpture on an empty plinth in the members' lobby later this year. But Mrs Beckett has told a number of MPs she considers that to be \"inappropriate\" under parliament's 10-year rule which traditionally bans statues of politicians in the first decade after their death. Supporters and opponents of the proposed Thatcher statue are expected to call a truce until after the election when the battle is likely to recommence in earnest. Mr Banks believes an exception should be made for Britain's first female premier, though he remains a critic of her policies. The Labour MP yesterday declined to comment on talks with Mrs Beckett and other Commons authorities but predicted the statue would eventually be accepted. Mrs Beckett's office also declined to comment. The members' lobby outside the Commons chamber is dominated by bronze statues of Clement Attlee, Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, with a fourth plinth vacant. The \u00a350,000 cost of the Thatcher statue was provided by an anonymous donor and the ex-Tory leader has sat on about half a dozen occasions for sculptor Neil Collins. Lady Thatcher's office has refused to be drawn into the controversy, but the statue could go on loan to the National Portrait Gallery or another institution before it enters parliament.",

But faced with what EU scientists now call a unique situation with the world's first ever rapid spread of foot and mouth in an industrialised agricultural system, Mr Brown could ask permission from Europe within days. Consensus is growing in scientific circles that vaccination would not solve the problem, but could significantly damp down the weight of outbreaks and buy time to identify instances and slaughter faster, the two priorities for government. Of the three scientific groups asked by government to assess the rate of spread of the disease, only one was asked to look at vaccination. They concluded that it would be \"less effective\" than culling, but still \"useful.\" Debbie Reynolds, deputy head of the food standards agency, yesterday agreed: \"It would be less effective than a ring cull, but could be very significant in terms of reducing the size of future outbreaks\". Alex Donaldson, head of the Institute for Animal Health at Pirbright, which monitors foot and mouth around the world, said yesterday that he did not suport vaccination. \"Animals can still excrete the virus and remain carriers\", he warned.

The first is to vaccinate all animals in a ring around infected farms and then slaughter them, as the Dutch favour. The idea is to constrain spread of the disease before culling.

The teams of epidemiologists - specialists in how diseases spread - produced devastating confirmation that foot and mouth cannot be controlled by the government's existing methods. They suggested three ways to reduce the scale of the disaster: cutting the delay between the discovery of a suspected outbreak and the slaughter of the infected animals; extending \"firebreak\" culls of animals around in fected farms; and, most controversially, vaccination. One of the scientists, Professor Mark Woolhouse of the veterinary epidemiology department at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"We are all agreed that it is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. It is clear that this epidemic is indeed out of control, and therefore we have to consider other options.\" Besides the Woolhouse report, the other two groups were from Imperial College in London and the government's Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge.

      "body": "<p><strong> Why: </strong> I was born in Jamaica and left in 1962 but, for some reason, I keep getting drawn back there. Historically, it's very interesting, and, having travelled and filmed throughout the Caribbean, I reckon Jamaica's got the best of everything. There are beautiful beaches on the north coast, hills as lovely as those on St Lucia, and waterfalls as wonderful as the ones in Tobago. Of course, I'm not at all biased ... </p> <p><strong> The best thing:</strong> Firefly, where Sir Noel Coward used to live, is probably one of the most beautiful places on earth, and how he found it, I don't know. It's perched on a cliff-top and from it you can see the sea breaking against the rocks.

Historically, it's very interesting, and, having travelled and filmed throughout the Caribbean, I reckon Jamaica's got the best of everything. There are beautiful beaches on the north coast, hills as lovely as those on St Lucia, and waterfalls as wonderful as the ones in Tobago. Of course, I'm not at all biased ... The best thing: Firefly, where Sir Noel Coward used to live, is probably one of the most beautiful places on earth, and how he found it, I don't know. It's perched on a cliff-top and from it you can see the sea breaking against the rocks. There something about the way the sun hits the place, too. My advice: Forget what you've read in the newspapers, Jamaica gets a much worse press than it deserves. But do try to avoid behaving like a tourist.

      "body": "<p>At one time, \"Literature and Society\" was a phrase so much on everyone's lips that it earned itself an abbreviation: Lit &amp; Soc. And Lit &amp; Soc, I seemed to remember, had been for me a long-running enthusiasm. When complacently preparing my new collection of essays and reviews, The War Against Clich\u00e9, I planned to assemble my pieces on literature and society (pieces on FR Leavis and Lionel Trilling, and on lesser figures like Ian Robinson and Denis Donoghue). But when I leafed through the massed manuscripts I found only a handful of essays, all of them written, rather ominously, in the early 70s (when I was in my early 20s). Having re-read them, I toyed with the idea of including a nice little section called something like \"Literature and Society: The Vanished Debate\". Then I decided that my debate had better vanish too. The pieces themselves I considered earnest, overweening, and contentedly dull. More decisively, though, Lit &amp; Soc, and indeed literary criticism, felt dead and gone. </p> <p>That time now seems unrecognisably remote. I had a day job at the Times Literary Supplement. Even then I sensed discrepancy, as I joined an editorial conference (to help prepare, perhaps, a special number on Literature and Society), wearing shoulder-length hair, a flowered shirt, and knee-high tricoloured boots (well concealed, it is true, by the twin tepees of my flared trousers). My private life was middle-bohemian - hippyish and hedonistic, if not candidly debauched; but I was very moral when it came to literary criticism. I read it all the time, in the tub, on the tube; I always had about me my Edmund Wilson - or my William Empson. I took it seriously. </p> <p>We all did. We hung around the place talking about literary criticism. We sat in pubs and coffee bars talking about WK Wimsatt and G Wilson Knight, about Richard Hoggart and Northrop Frye, about Richard Poirier, Tony Tanner and George Steiner. It might have been in such a locale that my friend and colleague Clive James first formulated his view that, while literary criticism is not essential to literature, both are essential to civilisation. Everyone concurred. Literature, we felt, was the core discipline; criticism explored and popularised the significance of that centrality, creating a space around literature and thereby further exalting it. The early 70s, I should add, saw the great controversy about the Two Cultures: Art v Science (or FR Leavis v CP Snow). Perhaps the most fantastic thing about this cultural moment was that Art seemed to be winning. </p> <p>Literary historians know it as the Age of Criticism. It began, let us suggest, in 1948, with the publication of Eliot's Notes Towards the Definition of Culture and Leavis's The Great Tradition. What ended it? The brutalist answer would consist of a single four-letter word: Opec. In the 60s, you could live on 10 shillings a week: you slept on people's floors and sponged off your friends and sang for your supper - about literary criticism. Then, abruptly, a bus fare cost 10 shillings. The oil hike, and inflation, and then stagflation, revealed literary criticism as one of the many leisure-class fripperies we would have to get along without. Well, that's how it felt. But it now seems clear that literary criticism was inherently doomed. Explicitly or otherwise it had based itself on a structure of echelons and hierarchies; it was about the talent elite. And the structure atomised as soon as the forces of democratisation gave their next concerted push. </p> <p>Those forces - incomparably the most potent in our culture - have gone on pushing. And they are now running up against a natural barrier. Some citadels, true, have proved stormable. You can become rich without having any talent (via the scratchcard and the rollover jackpot). You can become famous without having any talent (by abasing yourself on some TV nerd-othon: a clear improvement on the older method of simply killing a celebrity and inheriting the aura). But you cannot become talented without having any talent. Therefore, talent must go. </p> <p>Literary criticism, now almost entirely confined to the universities, thus moves against talent by moving against the canon. Academic preferment will not come from a respectful study of Wordsworth's poetics; it will come from a challenging study of his politics - his attitude to the poor, say, or his unconscious \"valourisation\" of Napoleon; and it will come still faster if you ignore Wordsworth and elevate some (justly) neglected contemporary, by which process the canon may be quietly and steadily sapped. A brief consultation of the internet will show that meanwhile, at the other end of the business, everyone has become a literary critic - or at least a book-reviewer. </p> <p>Democratisation has made one inalienable gain: equality of the sentiments. I think Gore Vidal said this first, and he said it, not quite with mockery, but with lively scepticism. He said that, nowadays, nobody's feelings are more authentic, and thus more important, than anybody else's. This is the new credo, the new privilege. It is a privilege much exercised in the contemporary book review, whether on the web or in the literary pages. The reviewer calmly tolerates the arrival of the new novel or slim volume, defensively settles into it, and then sees which way it rubs him up. The right way or the wrong way. The results of this contact will form the data of the review, without any reference to the thing behind. And the thing behind, I am afraid, is talent, and the canon, and the body of knowledge we call literature. </p> <p>Probably some readers are getting the impression that I think these developments are to be deplored. Not so. It is the summit of idleness to deplore the present, to deplore actuality. Say whatever else you like about it, the present is unavoidable. And we, in the 70s, were frequently ridiculous, too, with our Fallacies and our Seven Types (and Leavis's besieged intensity was ridiculous. His shaping embarrassment, however, was to nominate as his model for sanity the person of DH Lawrence). Emotional egalitarianism, for example, looks hard to attack. I honour it, in a way, but it has to me the pale glow of illusion. It is utopian, which is to say that reality cannot be expected to support it. Then, too, these \"feelings\" are seldom unadulterated; they are admixtures of herd opinions and social anxieties, vanities, touchinesses, and everything else that makes up a self. </p> <p>One of the historical vulnerabilities of literature, as a subject for study, is that it has never seemed difficult enough. This may come as news to the buckled figure of the book-reviewer, and to the literary critic, but it's true. Hence the various attempts to elevate it, complicate it, systematise it. Interacting with literature is easy. Anyone can join in, because words (unlike palettes and pianos) lead a double life: we all have a competence. It is not surprising, therefore, that individual sensitivities come so strongly into play; not surprising, either, that the discipline has rolled over for democratisation far more readily than, for example, chemistry and Ancient Greek. In the long term, though, literature will resist levelling and revert to hierarchy. This isn't the decision of some snob of a belletrist. It is the decision of Judge Time, who constantly separates those who last from those who don't. </p> <p>Let me run, for a while, with an extended simile. Literature is the great garden that is always there and is open to everyone 24 hours a day. Who tends it? The old tour guides and sylviculturists, the wardens, the fuming parkies in their sweat-soaked serge: these have died off. If you do see an official, a professional, these days, then he's likely to be a scowl in a labcoat, come to flatten a forest or decapitate a peak. The public wanders, with its oohs and ahs, its groans and jeers, its million opinions. The wanderers feed the animals, they walk on the grass, they step in the flowerbeds. But the garden never suffers. It is, of course, Eden; it is unfallen and needs no care. </p> <p>Readers of my book are asked to keep an eye on the datelines which end these pieces, for they span nearly 30 years. You hope to get more relaxed and confident over time; and you should certainly get (or seem to get) kinder, simply by avoiding the stuff you are unlikely to warm to. Enjoying being insulting is a youthful corruption of power. You lose your taste for it when you realise how hard people try, how much they mind, and how long they remember (Angus Wilson and William Burroughs nursed my animadversions - and no doubt the animadversions of others - to the grave). . . I am also struck by how hard I sometimes was on writers who (I erroneously felt) were trying to influence me: Roth, Mailer, Ballard. </p> <p>You proceed by quotation. Quotation is the reviewer's only hard evidence. Or semi-hard evidence. Without it, in any case, criticism is a shop-queue monologue. Gallingly for the lit-crit imperialists (especially IA Richards), there is no means for distinguishing the excellent from the less excellent. The most muscular literary critics on earth have no equipment for establishing that: </p> <p> \"Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears\" </p> <p>is a better line than </p> <p> \"When all at once I saw a crowd\" </p> <p>- and, if they did, they would have to begin by saying that the former contains a dead expletive (\"do\") brought in to sustain the metre. Yet quotation is all we have. To idealise: all writing is a campaign against cliche. Not just cliches of the pen but cliches of the mind and cliches of the heart. When I dispraise, I am usually quoting cliches. When I praise, I am usually quoting the opposed qualities of freshness, energy and reverberation of voice. </p> <p>\u00a9 Martin Amis, 2001.

      "body": "<p>The life of Anthony Steel who, alongside Dirk Bogarde, was the highest-paid star in the great 1950s peak of the British film industry, was a sad story of riches to rags. Steel, who has died aged 80, was the stiff-upper-lipped star of many distinguished British war films, and seen by the Rank Organisation as someone who could be promoted as a heart-throb - the British answer to Gregory Peck and Rock Hudson</p> <p>But at the height of his fame, Steel - tall, handsome, well-connected, and gentlemanly off the screen as well as on it - suddenly broke his contract with Rank to go in pursuit of the voluptuous Swedish actress Anita Ekberg in Hollywood. He was never forgiven by Sir John Davis, the bull-headed chief of Rank at that time.</p> <p>His career in Hollywood died in comparison with Ekberg's, and his marriage to her ended in bitter rows. His subsequent career was patchy, and, after stage tours in the 1980s, the next decade found him living, first in a seedy Earl's Court hotel, then in sheltered accommodation in a tiny council flat in Northolt, west London, with graffiti on the walls. Almost totally cut off from his past, he would never tell friends where he was, and never contact his agent, David Daly.</p> <p>When he read of Steel's plight in a tabloid newspaper in the middle 1990s, Daly had \u00a31,500 due to the actor in television residual payments and other fees, but had no idea where to send it. The newspaper told him the address, and Daly drove there. At first, Steel refused to answer the door bell, which Daly did not find inexplicable in view of the environment, but later he opened a window and recognised his personal friend of 31 years' standing.</p> <p>Daly passed Steel \u00a3500 in cash, and told him he would find him somewhere better to live, ultimately getting him admitted to Denville Hall, the London home for retired theatrical people, and getting him a role as Dr Steven Hart, the guest lead in the television series The Brokers Man II.</p> <p>But he was not entirely surprised to find that Steel had lived in the tiny council flat for seven or eight years, and had cut himself off from outside contact: \"He was a very private man. He just decided that he would withdraw. He found a place to live and simply went into hiding. In some ways, it was not unlike him; if he decided that things weren't right, he would withdraw into himself and not contact anybody.\"</p> <p>Such was the downbeat ending. In 1948, when Steel made his first film, Saraband For Dead Lovers, he was hailed as a more polished version of what was then thought of as the beefcake which would beat Hollywood idols at their own game. The following year, Marry Me was hailed as a principal showcase for his presence and, in 1950, when the wartime escape film, The Wooden Horse, appeared, he seemed to be well on his way to becoming an international icon.</p> <p>For the next few years, Steel was continuously busy, making, among others, the comedy Laughter In Paradise (1951), Another Man's Poison, and the war stories, The Malta Story (1952) and Albert RN (1953). In 1955, it was The Sea Shall Not Have Them and, in 1956, Storm Over the Nile, The Black Tent and Checkpoint.</p> <p>It might have continued like that, but Steel was accident prone - the worst being meeting Anita Ekberg in December 1955, though he had previously been run through the hand by Errol Flynn's sword in The Master Of Ballantrae and injured his leg, requiring an operation on his knee, after colliding with a tree while making Where no Vultures Fly, in which he played a game warden in east Africa.</p> <p>Steel met Ekberg after making Storm Over The Nile, a remake of The Four Feathers, in which an apparent coward turns out to be a hero. After their initial encounter, at a film premiere, he called her the most beautiful woman he had ever met. They married in Florence in 1956.</p> <p>But while Steel was reserved and not at all stagey, Ekberg liked displaying herself, and there were soon rumours of drink-fuelled rows. Steel became prone to what was called \"hellraising\"; he hit photographers who pursued his wife, and was twice arrested for drink driving.</p> <p>It all seemed to be out of character. He had been born into genteel circles in Chelsea, the son of an Indian army officer, and gone to school in Ireland before Cambridge. When the second world war broke out, he joined the Grenadier Guards, all of which sat perfectly with the reputation he was to make in the Britain of the postwar years.</p> <p>Some of his friends believe the collapse of his marriage to Ekberg was a disaster from which he never recovered emotionally; he had previously been married to Juanita Forbes and, after Ekberg, married Johanna Melcher, a former Miss Austria, in 1964. It is certainly arguable that he never recovered professionally, for when he returned to Britain at the end of the 1950s, the affronted British film industry showed little interest. His later films included Hard Core (1977), The Racing Game (1979) and the Swords Of Wayland (1986), none of them notable.</p> <p>Apart from the stage tours of the 1980s, Steel's last assignments were polished guest appearances in pop-ular television series such as Bergerac, The Professionals, Tales Of The Unexpected, Robin Of Sherwood and Jemima Shaw Investigates.</p> <p>He leaves two daughters and a son.</p> <p>Anthony Maitland Steel, actor, born May 21 1920; died March 21 2001</p>",

      "body": "<p>In his foreword to the autobiography of animator William Hanna, who has died aged 90, his lifelong partner Joe Barbera wrote: \"William Shakespeare once asked, 'What's in a name?' For Bill Hanna and myself, the name of Hanna-Barbera inaugurated a lifelong creative alliance that I will always cherish.\"</p> <p>Hanna, so equal a half in the partnership of Hanna-Barbera Productions that they were occasionally wont to run their surnames in reverse, sat on one side of a large desk, with Barbera on the other. The setting was a battered building on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, where they wrote, directed and produced more than 200 Tom and Jerry cartoon shorts, and won seven Oscars and even more Emmys.</p> <p>They also created Huckleberry Hound, the Flintstones and a myriad of other mouth-moving, head-nodding characters. Hanna's understanding of comic tempo, and his ability to marshal top artistic talents into an efficient working unit, were perfect complements for Barbera's draughtsmanship, strong story sense and comic inventiveness.</p> <p>Hanna was born in Melrose, New Mexico, the only boy in a family of seven children. His father, William, was a sewage construction superintendent, and the family moved to Oregon, where he was involved in building the Balm Creek dam. In 1929, young Bill went to Compaton junior college to study journalism. Meanwhile, he had joined the Boy Scouts of America, an enthusiasm that never left him; in later years, he became a scoutmaster and, in 1991, won a special award from the Scouts' Great Western Council.</p> <p>After losing his job during the depression, Hanna's father went to Hollywood to help build the Pantages theatre, and he was able to give his son his first job. Then the fianc\u00e9 of one of his sisters told him about Leon Schlesinger, an independent producer who ran Pacific Art and Title. Schlesinger's distributor had offered him the chance to open an animation studio making short cartoons with music tracks. Hanna, whose hobby was music, rushed to see the producer and met the two men who would run the department.</p> <p>Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, two of Walt Disney's best men, showed him their first effort, a Loony Tune entitled Sinking In The Bath-Tub, starring their first hero, Bosko the Black Boy. Hanna promptly joined the staff as storyman and in-betweener - filling in the cel transparencies between the animators' poses - as well as advising and devising, a timing system for synchronising the music and sound effects.</p> <p>His first director's credit appeared in 1934 on a silly-symphony style short called To Spring. Three years later, Warner sacked Harman and Ising, but, within a year, they were cosily installed with Hanna as the new cartoon production department of MGM. Then Hanna met Barbera.</p> <p>The first MGM cartoons were no great success, despite the fact that they were animated versions of such newspaper comic-strip heroes as the Captain and the Kids. Economy may have been a factor, as the studio released them in sepiatone instead of full Technicolor, via Disney, the standard for virtually all cartoon films. What A Lion and Blue Monday were two of the series the new friends worked on. Then came their first original epic, Puss Gets The Boot, starring a cat and a mouse.</p> <p>Although the heroes were unnamed, they were clearly the model for Tom and Jerry. The names came when the studio, egged on by exhibitors' letters pressing for more cat-and-mouse fun, held an internal competition, won by an animator named John Carr. Another reason for making more was a totally unexpected nomination for that year's Academy award.</p> <p>The new partnership in well-produced animated hilarity was soon ranked second only to Walt Disney in its field. Disney, then concentrating on feature-length films, was less a competitor than he might have been, especially when MGM, realising the international popularity of Tom and Jerry, began to insert them into starry musicals. First came Anchors Aweigh (1945), when Gene Kelly danced with Jerry. Then came the title sequence for Holiday In Mexico (1946), followed by a brilliant underwater escapade with Esther Williams for Dangerous When Wet (1953), and, again with Kelly, Invitation To The Dance (1954).</p> <p>In 1943, Yankee Doodle Mouse, a war-time adventure for Tom and Jerry, won Hanna and Barbera their first Academy award. Six more would follow, but in the wake of success came shock; in 1956, after executive producer Fred Quimby retired, MGM shut down its animation studio.</p> <p>Hanna and Barbera promptly made a bid for the burgeoning television market. There was one major snag: the cost. Their Tom and Jerry films came out at $35,000 apiece for each seven-minute film. For one five-minute film, the TV distributor, Screen Gems, offered $2,700 - so Hanna devised a system of limited animation, with two new characters, a pair of dogs called Ruff and Reddy.</p> <p>Unlike Tom and Jerry, the dogs talked, which meant easy animation involving moving mouths and nodding heads. Voiced by radio comedians Daws Butler and Don Messick, the first Ruff and Reddy cartoon, Planet Pirates, was premiered by NBC on December 14 1957. Designed to make fun of popular science-fiction films, it was an immediate success, and NBC signed the new company, Hanna-Barbera Productions, for five years.</p> <p>For both men, this was the start of an incredible new career, but it also heralded the downfall of animation as an art. True, in time, colour would come along, and longer shows would be made - at 25 minutes - then seasonal specials to fill an hour, and feature-film animations for cinemas. True, animation would become a worldwide industry with cartoonists feeding their sequences to the Hollywood headquarters for assembly.</p> <p>True, Taft Communications bought the company in 1966 for $26m, and true that, in 1977, CBS televised a special called The Happy World of Hanna-Barbera. But it is also true that the contrasting clips from their MGM days show up the boring awfulness of their more recent productions.</p> <p>Hanna leaves his wife Violet, whom he married in 1936, a daughter and a son.</p> <p>William Denby Hanna, animator, born July 14 1910; died March 22 2001</p> <p>This obituary has been revised since the death of the author last year</p>",

Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising, two of Walt Disney's best men, showed him their first effort, a Loony Tune entitled Sinking In The Bath-Tub, starring their first hero, Bosko the Black Boy. Hanna promptly joined the staff as storyman and in-betweener - filling in the cel transparencies between the animators' poses - as well as advising and devising, a timing system for synchronising the music and sound effects. His first director's credit appeared in 1934 on a silly-symphony style short called To Spring. Three years later, Warner sacked Harman and Ising, but, within a year, they were cosily installed with Hanna as the new cartoon production department of MGM. Then Hanna met Barbera. The first MGM cartoons were no great success, despite the fact that they were animated versions of such newspaper comic-strip heroes as the Captain and the Kids. Economy may have been a factor, as the studio released them in sepiatone instead of full Technicolor, via Disney, the standard for virtually all cartoon films. What A Lion and Blue Monday were two of the series the new friends worked on. Then came their first original epic, Puss Gets The Boot, starring a cat and a mouse. Although the heroes were unnamed, they were clearly the model for Tom and Jerry. The names came when the studio, egged on by exhibitors' letters pressing for more cat-and-mouse fun, held an internal competition, won by an animator named John Carr. Another reason for making more was a totally unexpected nomination for that year's Academy award. The new partnership in well-produced animated hilarity was soon ranked second only to Walt Disney in its field. Disney, then concentrating on feature-length films, was less a competitor than he might have been, especially when MGM, realising the international popularity of Tom and Jerry, began to insert them into starry musicals. First came Anchors Aweigh (1945), when Gene Kelly danced with Jerry. Then came the title sequence for Holiday In Mexico (1946), followed by a brilliant underwater escapade with Esther Williams for Dangerous When Wet (1953), and, again with Kelly, Invitation To The Dance (1954). In 1943, Yankee Doodle Mouse, a war-time adventure for Tom and Jerry, won Hanna and Barbera their first Academy award. Six more would follow, but in the wake of success came shock; in 1956, after executive producer Fred Quimby retired, MGM shut down its animation studio. Hanna and Barbera promptly made a bid for the burgeoning television market. There was one major snag: the cost. Their Tom and Jerry films came out at $35,000 apiece for each seven-minute film. For one five-minute film, the TV distributor, Screen Gems, offered $2,700 - so Hanna devised a system of limited animation, with two new characters, a pair of dogs called Ruff and Reddy. Unlike Tom and Jerry, the dogs talked, which meant easy animation involving moving mouths and nodding heads. Voiced by radio comedians Daws Butler and Don Messick, the first Ruff and Reddy cartoon, Planet Pirates, was premiered by NBC on December 14 1957. Designed to make fun of popular science-fiction films, it was an immediate success, and NBC signed the new company, Hanna-Barbera Productions, for five years. For both men, this was the start of an incredible new career, but it also heralded the downfall of animation as an art. True, in time, colour would come along, and longer shows would be made - at 25 minutes - then seasonal specials to fill an hour, and feature-film animations for cinemas. True, animation would become a worldwide industry with cartoonists feeding their sequences to the Hollywood headquarters for assembly. True, Taft Communications bought the company in 1966 for $26m, and true that, in 1977, CBS televised a special called The Happy World of Hanna-Barbera. But it is also true that the contrasting clips from their MGM days show up the boring awfulness of their more recent productions. Hanna leaves his wife Violet, whom he married in 1936, a daughter and a son.

      "body": "<p>Aleaflet in the post invites me to a tantric sex workshop and I'm not in a relationship. Just my luck. Where were these workshops the last time I had an unimaginative lover? And why would I want to go on a tantric workshop on my own? </p> <p>\"I mean, can you imagine the kind of men I'll meet? They'll all have a well-developed feminine side. They'll all have long, thin bodies.\" </p> <p>\"And long, thin willies,\" my friend Anna interjected when I complained to her about my predicament. </p> <p>\"They'll wear floaty clothes and have straggly hair and warm, sympathetic smiles.\" </p> <p>\"They'll do those double handshakes while looking into your eyes,\" she grinned. </p> <p>I started to scream. </p> <p>It's not that I think I'll be expected to have any sex, tantric or otherwise, with any of these men. It's just that it would be good to want to. To be overcome with a desire to dedicate my body to another participant's learning process. </p> <p>Perhaps I could take someone else's husband with me. Call up a married girlfriend and say, \"Hi, Julie, I was wondering if I could borrow your husband for the weekend? I'm going on a course to study tantric sex and I need a partner, you see, and . . . Julie? Are you there?\" </p> <p>Or I could put out a general email to all the men in my life on the other side of the Atlantic: Unique opportunity offered. Fly to London (at your own expense) and take a workshop (at your own expense) on, er, sex - not that I was suggesting that you need to... Oh dear. </p> <p>Or what about inviting a complete stranger? There is a rather attractive, good-looking waiter in the new Starbucks on the King's Road. I could try, \"A caf\u00e9 mocha, please, and, well, yes, there was something else I wanted, actually... I was wondering if you'd like to join me for a weekend workshop to study tantric sex?\" He'd probably smile in a long-suffering way and say, \"I'm gay - sorry\", and I'd be hugely embarrassed and not be able to drink coffee in there again. </p> <p>There is one possible sign of hope. The person whom the organisers have arranged to give me a lift to the workshop turns out to be an independent TV and film producer. I did a bit of research and found out which company he owns and what films they've made. Maybe I could sort the next job and the next relationship in one weekend? </p> <p>The lift was to be shared with another tantric learner. She arrived to meet me looking like one of those Indian pictures of the Divine. Her long legs were clearly visible through floaty black muslin trousers and a small white diamond twinkled enticingly just below her navel. She wore a deep-red top with extravagant jewellery and a beautiful waistcoat that was a sophisticated blend of reds, with golden threads intricately woven through the colour. Her waist-length dark, shiny hair looked like a commercial for some silky conditioner. Her make-up was subtle and perfect, and she wore a crimson teardrop in the centre of her forehead. The overall effect was breathtaking. She spoke with one of those exotic accents that are instantly attractive and mysterious. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, was wearing a pair of jeans, old trainers and an oversized black fleece. My accent was decidedly Battersea and I hadn't made time to wash my hair, which was looking like the \"dull, lifeless hair?\"part of a shampoo commercial. </p> <p>A large BMW rolled up and a very thin man with glasses and a big smile got out. \"You must be Stellianna,\" he said, turning to shake hands with the vision of mysterious loveliness. \"And your name, was, er?\" Why do I do this to myself? </p> <p>\"Er, Isabel,\" I mumbled. \"No, I don't mind sitting in the back of the car.\" </p> <p>It was to be one of those dreadful journeys, with traffic jams, a vague feeling of nausea from sitting in the back and snippets of half-overheard conversation from the front. And I was given the map-reading job. \"It's the next turn-off, isn't it? [Thinly disguised impatience] Are you sure?\" It was inevitable by this stage that I was going to mess up, make mistakes and humiliate myself. \"Well, I, er, thought the Broad would be prettier.\" I tried to look blas\u00e9 as he stared first at the map and then at me with a look of total incomprehension. </p> <p>And, of course, his mobile phone kept ringing. He'd say, \"Washington DC? Tuesday? Tell them absolutely not. They'll have to suggest another date.\" Or \"The premiere? Yes, say we'd be delighted.\" Or simply, \"I can't talk now - I'm on the motorway.\" My mobile was not ringing, despite the fact that I had briefed my daughter and asked her specifically to \"phone me a lot\" on Friday afternoon. She rang once and complained that she'd wiped off the outgoing message on the answering machine. So I was overheard saying, \"Well, just run the tape to the end and then you can re-record it. No, it's the button on the left! Oh [exasperated tone] never mind.\" And that was the only time my phone rang. Blasted thing. Who invented mobile phones? </p> <p>We arrived at a large, beautiful centre in Hereford a lifetime later but still in time for supper. Ms Inner Feminine was shouting at me. \"Hello? Attention, please?\" I washed my hair and put on a dress. Anything to keep her quiet. </p> <p>After dinner, while we were sitting waiting for the first tantric something to start, an unexpected miracle occurred. I received a note from the TV producer. </p> <p>It said, \"Dearest Isabel, since the moment we met I have felt that special warm vibration. Can you feel it? Your tantric slave, Simon.\" Ms Feminine smiled smugly, \"See, I told you it was worth putting on a dress.\" Mr Masculine thought, \"This guy's crazy.\" I wrote back, \"Warm vibration? Are you sure it's not your mobile phone switched to 'vibrate'?\" He looked at the note and took up his pen again. Two kids now writing notes to each other in class. This workshop was fun already. \"It's you. You are the perfect woman. A goddess.\" </p> <p>The Goddess workshop I'd joined had obviously been worth the money. My transformation must have been more complete than I had realised. Not sure about his writing style, though. I scribbled away... \"I presume that you work in drama rather than documentary?\" I'd already checked him out for hidden cameras. He just went on with his adoration. \"You are beautiful. Your face. Your body. Your eyes. Your eyebrows.\" </p> <p>My eyebrows? He wasn't a scriptwriter. </p> <p>\"Will you deny me, oh heartless one?\" </p> <p>\"Deny you!? It's Friday evening.\" </p> <p>\"Will you let me be your tantric slave and give you total and unconditional love all through the workshop?\" </p> <p>So, would you say no to a tantric sex slave who was offering unconditional love? He was rather thin. I had a quick look round the room. Average age of male participants? Sixty. Average size of beer guts? Huge. Hair on heads? Very little. Hair on chins? Prolific. Men with an overdeveloped feminine side always grow beards. It doesn't really fool anyone. One of the very overweight men smiled at me warmly. Anything to avoid the double handshake later. And there was always the excuse that I had to \"use everything for my learning, upliftment and growth\". Best to put these learnings into practice wherever possible. </p> <p>\"Okay then, Simon. As you are so impressed by my eyebrows.\" </p> <p>He came to sit next to me, grinning happily. This was a pleasant surprise. Here was I, the woman who goes after men, having a man run after me. I liked this experience. Maybe this was one of the tall, dark, handsome strangers promised by the astrologer. </p> <p>The first process was to begin blindfolded. It was called \"the awakening\". The leaders had prepared a feast for each of our senses. We were led to another room and sat on cushions while the most sensuous sounds filled our ears: gentle drumming, the patter of rain-sticks, bells of all sizes, the deep hum of singing bowls. I slid down into my cushion, healed already by the beauty of sound. Then the sense of smell was to be rediscovered. They had all the wonders of a full aromatherapy shop to pass under our ecstatic noses: citrus, strawberry, myrrh, lavender, sandalwood, peppermint, freshly baked bread, cut grass, vanilla. Then to taste: fresh mango placed sensitively on the lips, dates, pineapple, ice cream, apple crumble, chocolate, red grapes. Then touch: sea shells, fur, stones, dough, crystal, wax, fluffy leaves, fir cones. </p> <p>Next, we were invited to turn and reach out our fingertips to the person next to us. I turned and with a hair's breadth of gentleness touched the very tips of the fingers next to mine. \"Just explore these hands with your sense of touch,\" a velvet voice intoned. So we played, these hands and my hands, blindfolds still in place - fingers were intertwined, palms touched palms, thumbs stroked thumbs. A sweet tenderness. An innocence. My white-dressed child was happy to play this game. </p> <p>Finally, we were invited to remove our blindfolds. I opened my eyes. They had been Simon's hands. Somehow he had managed to get himself placed next to me. (I discovered later that he had told one of the helpers we were a couple.) His conquest was going well. I felt okay with him now. He smiled at me. We turned and looked at the room filled with candles and beautiful statues of the god Shiva making love to the goddess Shakti. There were also many-armed symbols of love and the celebration of sexuality. My eye was caught by a large pink crystal ornament in the shape of an erect penis. I imagined putting one on the coffee table in my sitting room for the neighbours to admire. I'd say, \"That, Mrs Jones? Oh it's just a little souvenir of Hereford that I picked up. Do you like it?\" </p> <p> But here, in the candlelight, they looked beautiful. I guess the penis gets a lot of bad press. Women complain about its misuse or how much men are led by it, or deride it when it goes wrinkly or tell jokes about it. Men complain that it isn't big enough or doesn't work well enough, or gets them into trouble or is too active or not active enough. Here the penis was named \"Vajra\" (meaning thunderbolt) and was to be celebrated. So we feasted our eyes on erect crystal peni (plural of penis?), then cuddled like children, went our separate ways and went to sleep. And here ended the first day. </p> <p>Over breakfast, the other participants enquired as to whether we were a couple. \"We're not sure,\" he said. \"No, this weekend is an experiment,\" I smiled. The deception was complete. They all thought that we were a long-term couple pretending not to be. We touched like a couple, we related like a couple. It was fun. An easy game to play. </p> <p>Most of the first morning was taken up with the now familiar \"sharing\" process. We were 22 participants this time, sitting on a circle of cushions. They had been careful to arrange an equal number of men and women. The leaders of the workshops were an odd pair who, of course, weren't a couple. The man would definitely have won the award for the least attractive male in the room. He was about 50 going on 60, overweight, had longish, straggly hair that needed a wash, comical glasses and a large and unfortunate gap between his two front teeth. I wasn't going to be signing up for any private lessons. </p> <p>In her introduction, the woman told us, \"I've had six children by six different men.\" An impressive track record by any standards. And she went on: \"I've always been interested in sexuality.\" I'd guessed that. She was also overweight, but she managed to carry her weight like an expression of her sexuality and it made her even more voluptuous somehow. They wouldn't have won any prizes in a fitness competition. But then, I considered, if they'd looked like Barbie and Ken, and she'd started by telling us that she'd just had a facelift, they'd hardly have been in a position to teach self-acceptance. They were as honest and open as it was possible to be; they knew their subject and, like all these new age facilitators, they breathed love. </p> <p>The sharing was touching, as it always is. Happy couples that had somehow lost their way sexually. Old couples who had lost it completely. Newlyweds who wanted to do the sex thing really well. Young couples who were just there to have fun. And then the singles, brave people who wanted to learn this stuff and were not waiting for Mr or Ms Right to come along. Those who admitted, with great courage, that they felt clumsy sexually or just lacked confidence. Simon and I said that we had come to learn as much as we could and to put it into practice. We were so convincing it was silly. </p> <p>The rest of the morning was mainly loosening up and playing games. Disco dancing - some energetic, some slow, some raunchy - invitations to pull faces at each other, grab bums or argue with each other in non-existent languages. There was even an invitation to say \"fuck off\" to everyone. Tantric ice-breakers. </p> <p>It was easy and fun. Then lunch. Vegetarian, of course. Simon rushed off to make an important phone call to New York. I sat and ate tofu with a young Chinese professor from Oxford. He had been raised by Jesuit priests and was so cross with what they had denied him in terms of his sexual education that he didn't seem to notice that they had given him such a good academic education he was now the leader in his field. I suggested that he wrote his next PhD on the subject of tantric sex. Suddenly his eyes lit up and being an academic didn't seem to promise such a dry future as he'd thought. Simon and I ignored each other. We were a couple, after all. </p> <p>When the first exercise of the afternoon started, the instruction was, \"Bonded couples work together - everyone else choose a partner for this exercise.\" Simon simply walked straight over to me. Of course, I could have said no. But I was being offered unconditional love and support and, having touched his fingers, I didn't really want to turn him down. </p> <p>The afternoon lesson was about exploring masculine and feminine energy. \"Walk round the room and celebrate your gender. As you make eye-contact with someone, say the words 'I am a woman' if you are a woman, and 'I am a man' if you are a man - to each person you meet. It can be playful, vulnerable, strong, sexy, seductive or however you like. Say this to both the men and to the women.\" </p> <p>Most of the time in these workshops I am filled with a feeling of unconditional acceptance of everyone. I make use of \"the inner beauty I see in you\" exercise I'd picked up at another workshop. But not always. Sometimes the old bitter, twisted cynic steps in. So, when some of these men walked up to me and said, \"I am a man\", I thought, \"No, I'm afraid I don't agree - I have some clue about what a man is, and I can tell you, you ain't it. You have the face of a woman, the energy of a woman, the voice of a woman. Have you ever ridden a motorbike? Initiated anything? Punched someone? Drunk beer? Had sex? It certainly doesn't look like it!\" </p> <p>However, I didn't say all this, of course. I simply smiled and gave the required response: \"And I am a woman.\" Then the facilitators said, \"And that is only half the truth, because inside every man is a woman and inside every woman is a man.\" So then we were to repeat the exercise. My inner masculine was very happy being allowed to speak. Going around the room saying, \"I am a man\", seemed like stating the obvious. The feminine and sensitive men were probably thinking, \"Yes, God help us.\" But I knew by now that as I've been a single father as well as a single mother all my daughter's life my inner masculine is not hard for me to access. Even an astrologer had told me as much. </p> <p>And some of these men, none of whom was gay, now seemed to be nearer the truth. \"I am a woman,\" they were saying. I was thinking, \"I knew that already.\" Other men were afraid to say this, so they fooled around, went into \"camp\", put on silly voices, acted like little girls. Not so my thin \"bonded partner\". He walked straight up to me, every inch the masculine energy, and said quite clearly, \"I am a woman.\" He made it so easy. He was completely comfortable with his masculine energy and completely comfortable with his feminine energy. He didn't need to hide it, disguise it or apologise for it. He simply stated it. </p> <p>And he was happy with me saying \"I am a man\" as a simple fact. He didn't seem to be judging me for how comfortable I was with that statement. I suppose he'd already told me I was a goddess. Perhaps he really did accept me as I was. </p> <p>That was a good thing to know before the next exercise. The instructions began: \"Kneel opposite your partner. The woman likes to give out her energy through her heart. The man needs to receive through his heart. He likes to give out his energy through his sex. She needs to receive him through her sex. When this works, a circle is created.\" </p> <p>Sounds so simple, doesn't it? This is what we were to experience using our breathing. I breathed out, making a movement with my hand from my heart to his. He breathed in to receive me, then he breathed out, making a movement with his hand from his sexual organs to mine, and I breathed in, moving my hand toward my \"sex\". </p> <p>Now, before your imagination runs away with you, I should add that there was no touching and this was only an exercise about the transfer of energy. But with eye-contact being maintained at all times, you can imagine that this was still fairly intimate. In fact, \"fairly intimate\" is a bit of an understatement. It was one of the most intimate exercises I'd ever done in a seminar. </p> <p>Then we were to reverse it, to experience the energy the other way round. The woman also needs to give out energy through her sexuality and receive with her heart, and it is important for both partners to experience both roles. A little empathy leads to a lot of understanding. </p> <p>Then, just when I was getting totally overwhelmed, they announced dinner. I listened to a woman who was there alone. \"I have been bisexual in the past,\" she said, \"but I feel that I now want to have a committed relationship with a man.\" </p> <p>Yes, her and a million of my other single female friends. \"I would love to do the one-year training course with a partner. But the one-year singles course I'm not so sure about.\" I choked on my lentil soup. </p> <p>\"The what? The one-year couples training? You mean they do a one-year course in all this?\" </p> <p>\"The couples course starts in June next year. It's five four-day residentials and lots of homework in the middle.\" </p> <p>\"What do they teach that takes a year?\" </p> <p>\"Tantra is about learning how to contain the sexual energy that we release at orgasm so that the pleasure becomes implosive instead of explosive, or you can rest in the pleasure for as long as you want to. When you can consciously contain this energy, it takes you to higher states of consciousness, where sexuality and spirituality meet. They can't hope to teach that in two days. This is just a taster weekend.\" </p> <p>\"It sounds wonderful.\" </p> <p>\"Will you and Simon be doing it? Taking the course, I mean?\" I felt I had to come clean with her. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you the truth,\" I confessed, \"we only met yesterday.\" Her jaw fell. </p> <p>\"But you are both so...\" </p> <p>\"Yes, I know,\" I said hastily, lest she have a chance to finish the sentence. </p> <p>\"It is rather amazing, isn't it? But will we be doing the couples course? I really couldn't say.\" She started to laugh. We drank coffee. I liked her a lot. </p> <p>If only I could have that change of sexual preference, life would be so much easier. </p> <p>\"But anyway...\" she lowered her voice, \"we have to remember that we are here to work on our own sexual growth and understanding. It's really not about who we are with. The real journey is with ourselves.\" Suddenly, I saw Sister Alison from the convent I'd visited sitting in front of me. \"The real journey, Isabel, is with yourself.\" Good grief, I'm even told this on a tantric sex weekend? Blast the truths of life. </p> <p>The evening of this course happened to hit Halloween night. They weren't going to let an opportunity like that go by. We were invited to take a different partner. Only, of course, the \"bonded couples\" worked together. Simon, my lifetime lover, appeared at my side. This next exercise wasn't easy. They wanted to use the \"night of dark powers\" for all it was worth. The facilitators spoke of darkness, the subconscious, of what was forbidden, of what had been banished. </p> <p>Then the instructions: \"The man should hold the woman in his arms as she goes on an imaginative journey in her mind, down into the deep darkness below death to see what is there.\" He held me in his arms. I didn't really want to go anywhere beyond death with him. But he was so loving and supportive, it would have been churlish not to play. </p> <p>I listened to the velvet voice of the fat man with the gap in his teeth and descended into the depths of my mind, where I was surprised to meet a wild dancing god. Or maybe he was an Indian sexual demon. I watched in amazement as he leaped and hurled himself around. He was okay safely hidden in my mind's eye. </p> <p>But then the voice said, \"Now bring this energy into you and bring the images to life. Get up, dance.\" So I got up and danced. I flung myself around. There was a kind of freedom, but as I looked into Simon's eyes, the support of the male Shiva, filled with his promised unconditional love, I knew I was pretending. I felt disconnected from my experience and self-conscious. It reminded me of times as an actress, when I'd been on stage and known that I was acting badly. I had not become the Indian sexual demon I saw. I was observing myself being a fraud and still dancing, anyway. I did the exercise, but it wasn't real. </p> <p>Then it was his turn. I got to hold him while he did his inner journey. I don't know where he went, but he certainly wasn't pretending. He was crying in my arms. I stroked his hair, being the all-loving mother that I had been instructed to personify. But when he got up to do his dance, I left the mother role right behind. Where, I asked myself, had this man learned to move? I thought I was a trained dancer - but ballet class at the Royal Academy of Dancing was never like this. </p> <p>As he started to dance, he played with his sexual energy. I watched him and I could see him wait until he sensed the glimmers of arousal. He moved slowly at first, delighting in his senses. This was too much. I was glad we were in candlelight by this time, as my face must have been redder than the satin cushion I was sitting on. He was, quite simply, one of the most erotic dancers I had ever seen. True, he was displeasingly thin, but this expression of sexuality meant I could generously tolerate that. Have you ever seen anyone dance in their sexual energy? It made me shake to watch him. </p> <p>Then the exercise finished. We were invited to stay in the room as long as we liked but to \"please respect the sacred space\". Which, I guess, meant, in case anyone had done the exercise too well, no bonking. </p> <p>So the couples lay and cuddled and chatted and laughed. We just lay and held each other. It was so easy to be held. I could have imagined this exercise with some of my former partners. They'd have been saying, \"Well, you didn't get that exercise at all, did you, Isabel? I knew you were pretending. And what really irritated me about what you did was...\" My ex-husband would have said, \"Nice try.\" This man just held me. So you can imagine he was a great trial to be with. Then, one by one and two by two, we all went our separate ways and went to sleep. And here ended the second day. </p> <p>The Sunday exercises were harder still. We never celebrated All Saints' Day like this in the Church of England. \"And this morning, my brothers and sisters, we are going to celebrate this day of the Lord by our practice of sexual breathing. We will then read the Song Of Solomon and sing Hymn number 317, Glad That I Live Am I.\" Here I was praising God in my own sweet way. We were to learn sexual breathing and how to build the energy in the pelvis with pelvic rocking. Also how to hold the sexual energy using the pelvic muscles. This sounds raunchy, but after the Goddess workshop it was surprisingly sensitive. After all, there had been no nudity and everyone was free to participate, or not, as they wished. </p> <p>Sexual breathing was another exercise to be done while maintaining eye-contact with your partner. I was touched that the woman was to find her rhythm of pelvic rocking and then the man was to take his rhythm from her. This proved to be a bit like dancing. No sooner did I establish a rhythm - squeeze pelvic muscle, breathe, rock forward, release pelvic muscle, exhale - than I'd lose it again. The Shakti incarnation of the female facilitator encouraged me. \"Be patient - this is the first time you've done this exercise together.\" Too right it was. </p> <p>Then suddenly it was Sunday lunchtime and we were in the \"closing sharing\". It was so tender. The couples said that they had rediscovered a connection. One man of about 60, there with his wife, cried as he looked at her. The newlyweds said they had found a way forward. The stuck couples said they were unstuck. The singles said what they'd learned and how touched they were by the support of the group. One woman who had come alone had never done any work of this kind before, and had become less and less terrified as the weekend progressed - by the end, she was finally able to speak. </p> <p>And as for me, I felt like a whole person again. I had been taught not to apologise for having a \"well-developed masculine side\". I am a woman, after all, and so to be a beautiful woman with positive masculine qualities of strength and vitality is often a bonus. My ability to see the male point of view is sometimes so accurate I even amaze myself. But I do still want a real Shiva god around to look after me and I know how to be vulnerable, too. It's true, I am still learning to listen to my feminine side, but she is alive and well and growing in confidence all the time. So maybe I really am evolving? </p> <p>But this is not the end of the story. \"What about Simon?\" I hear you ask. \"What happened next?\" The workshop finished after lunch so that people could enjoy the idyllic countryside. The sun was shining in a blue sky. It was a perfect autumn afternoon. The Indian goddess we had travelled up with was going back with one of the couples. It all seemed too good to be true. It was. Simon appeared after lunch in a suit instead of his \"walking though the countryside\" clothes. \"I'm afraid if you want a lift in my car I have to leave in 10 minutes.\" I couldn't believe it - his mobile phone was actually ringing. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry, I have a meeting in London at six and I...\" </p> <p>\"That's okay,\" I sighed, looking at the leaves falling over the orchard, \"I'll get my bag.\" </p> <p>I knew he was going to be worried that I may have got a little fond of him. He was male, after all. \"You're afraid I'm going to ring you or something, aren't you?\" I asked him. We were half an hour from London. He'd spent the first three hours asking me about my life and telling me how wonderful I'd been. </p> <p>\"It's just that... I do have a... sort of... relationship,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Er, sort of ?\" I requested a definition of this interesting adjective. </p> <p>\"Well, okay, a long-term relationship, I guess.\" </p> <p>\"How long have you known her?\" I asked, having learned over the weekend to be completely honest and open with this man. </p> <p>\"About 10 years.\" He took a phone call. \"Seven tonight? No, that's fine. See you then.\" </p> <p>\"How long do you expect to know her for?\" I asked in a matter-of-fact voice. </p> <p>He smiled at the thought of her. \"The rest of my life, I expect.\" </p> <p>I was not yet speechless. \"And do you live with this woman?\" He wriggled uncomfortably at the inquisition. </p> <p>\"Sometimes.\" </p> <p>\"Sometimes? How can you live with a woman sometimes? Do you live with her or don't you?\" </p> <p>\"Er, yes.\" </p> <p>\"Simon, this weekend was divided into those with partners and those without. If you have a sexual partner who wasn't present, why on earth didn't you say so? Why didn't you invite her? Why didn't you tell the group? Why didn't you at least tell me? Why didn't you...\" </p> <p>\"Oh dear. I hope you didn't think that we could have had some future together. I did offer you my love for the weekend.\" </p> <p>\"Yes, but after the kind of intimacy we have just experienced, I did at least think that maybe I could ring you sometime. That maybe we could have had dinner, or gone to a film or something.\" Another lesson in non-attachment. I crumpled up and started to weep on to the floor of his BMW. </p> <p>\"Listen,\" he said, as I lifted my suitcase from his car and walked away. (And every word of this is true), \"I hope I didn't mislead you in any way?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This is an edited extract from The Battersea Park Road To Enlightenment, by Isabel Losada, published by Bloomsbury on April 9, at \u00a36.99.

      "bodyText": "Aleaflet in the post invites me to a tantric sex workshop and I'm not in a relationship. Just my luck. Where were these workshops the last time I had an unimaginative lover? And why would I want to go on a tantric workshop on my own? \"I mean, can you imagine the kind of men I'll meet? They'll all have a well-developed feminine side. They'll all have long, thin bodies.\" \"And long, thin willies,\" my friend Anna interjected when I complained to her about my predicament. \"They'll wear floaty clothes and have straggly hair and warm, sympathetic smiles.\" \"They'll do those double handshakes while looking into your eyes,\" she grinned. I started to scream. It's not that I think I'll be expected to have any sex, tantric or otherwise, with any of these men. It's just that it would be good to want to. To be overcome with a desire to dedicate my body to another participant's learning process. Perhaps I could take someone else's husband with me. Call up a married girlfriend and say, \"Hi, Julie, I was wondering if I could borrow your husband for the weekend? I'm going on a course to study tantric sex and I need a partner, you see, and . . . Julie? Are you there?\" Or I could put out a general email to all the men in my life on the other side of the Atlantic: Unique opportunity offered. Fly to London (at your own expense) and take a workshop (at your own expense) on, er, sex - not that I was suggesting that you need to... Oh dear. Or what about inviting a complete stranger? There is a rather attractive, good-looking waiter in the new Starbucks on the King's Road. I could try, \"A caf\u00e9 mocha, please, and, well, yes, there was something else I wanted, actually... I was wondering if you'd like to join me for a weekend workshop to study tantric sex?\" He'd probably smile in a long-suffering way and say, \"I'm gay - sorry\", and I'd be hugely embarrassed and not be able to drink coffee in there again. There is one possible sign of hope. The person whom the organisers have arranged to give me a lift to the workshop turns out to be an independent TV and film producer. I did a bit of research and found out which company he owns and what films they've made. Maybe I could sort the next job and the next relationship in one weekend? The lift was to be shared with another tantric learner. She arrived to meet me looking like one of those Indian pictures of the Divine. Her long legs were clearly visible through floaty black muslin trousers and a small white diamond twinkled enticingly just below her navel. She wore a deep-red top with extravagant jewellery and a beautiful waistcoat that was a sophisticated blend of reds, with golden threads intricately woven through the colour. Her waist-length dark, shiny hair looked like a commercial for some silky conditioner. Her make-up was subtle and perfect, and she wore a crimson teardrop in the centre of her forehead. The overall effect was breathtaking. She spoke with one of those exotic accents that are instantly attractive and mysterious. I, on the other hand, was wearing a pair of jeans, old trainers and an oversized black fleece. My accent was decidedly Battersea and I hadn't made time to wash my hair, which was looking like the \"dull, lifeless hair?\"part of a shampoo commercial. A large BMW rolled up and a very thin man with glasses and a big smile got out. \"You must be Stellianna,\" he said, turning to shake hands with the vision of mysterious loveliness. \"And your name, was, er?\" Why do I do this to myself? \"Er, Isabel,\" I mumbled. \"No, I don't mind sitting in the back of the car.\" It was to be one of those dreadful journeys, with traffic jams, a vague feeling of nausea from sitting in the back and snippets of half-overheard conversation from the front. And I was given the map-reading job. \"It's the next turn-off, isn't it? [Thinly disguised impatience] Are you sure?\" It was inevitable by this stage that I was going to mess up, make mistakes and humiliate myself. \"Well, I, er, thought the Broad would be prettier.\" I tried to look blas\u00e9 as he stared first at the map and then at me with a look of total incomprehension. And, of course, his mobile phone kept ringing. He'd say, \"Washington DC? Tuesday? Tell them absolutely not. They'll have to suggest another date.\" Or \"The premiere? Yes, say we'd be delighted.\" Or simply, \"I can't talk now - I'm on the motorway.\" My mobile was not ringing, despite the fact that I had briefed my daughter and asked her specifically to \"phone me a lot\" on Friday afternoon. She rang once and complained that she'd wiped off the outgoing message on the answering machine. So I was overheard saying, \"Well, just run the tape to the end and then you can re-record it. No, it's the button on the left! Oh [exasperated tone] never mind.\" And that was the only time my phone rang. Blasted thing. Who invented mobile phones? We arrived at a large, beautiful centre in Hereford a lifetime later but still in time for supper. Ms Inner Feminine was shouting at me. \"Hello? Attention, please?\" I washed my hair and put on a dress. Anything to keep her quiet. After dinner, while we were sitting waiting for the first tantric something to start, an unexpected miracle occurred. I received a note from the TV producer. It said, \"Dearest Isabel, since the moment we met I have felt that special warm vibration. Can you feel it? Your tantric slave, Simon.\" Ms Feminine smiled smugly, \"See, I told you it was worth putting on a dress.\" Mr Masculine thought, \"This guy's crazy.\" I wrote back, \"Warm vibration? Are you sure it's not your mobile phone switched to 'vibrate'?\" He looked at the note and took up his pen again. Two kids now writing notes to each other in class. This workshop was fun already. \"It's you. You are the perfect woman. A goddess.\" The Goddess workshop I'd joined had obviously been worth the money. My transformation must have been more complete than I had realised. Not sure about his writing style, though. I scribbled away... \"I presume that you work in drama rather than documentary?\" I'd already checked him out for hidden cameras. He just went on with his adoration. \"You are beautiful. Your face. Your body. Your eyes. Your eyebrows.\" My eyebrows? He wasn't a scriptwriter. \"Will you deny me, oh heartless one?\" \"Deny you!? It's Friday evening.\" \"Will you let me be your tantric slave and give you total and unconditional love all through the workshop?\" So, would you say no to a tantric sex slave who was offering unconditional love? He was rather thin. I had a quick look round the room. Average age of male participants? Sixty. Average size of beer guts? Huge. Hair on heads? Very little. Hair on chins? Prolific. Men with an overdeveloped feminine side always grow beards. It doesn't really fool anyone. One of the very overweight men smiled at me warmly. Anything to avoid the double handshake later. And there was always the excuse that I had to \"use everything for my learning, upliftment and growth\". Best to put these learnings into practice wherever possible. \"Okay then, Simon. As you are so impressed by my eyebrows.\" He came to sit next to me, grinning happily. This was a pleasant surprise. Here was I, the woman who goes after men, having a man run after me. I liked this experience. Maybe this was one of the tall, dark, handsome strangers promised by the astrologer. The first process was to begin blindfolded. It was called \"the awakening\". The leaders had prepared a feast for each of our senses. We were led to another room and sat on cushions while the most sensuous sounds filled our ears: gentle drumming, the patter of rain-sticks, bells of all sizes, the deep hum of singing bowls. I slid down into my cushion, healed already by the beauty of sound. Then the sense of smell was to be rediscovered. They had all the wonders of a full aromatherapy shop to pass under our ecstatic noses: citrus, strawberry, myrrh, lavender, sandalwood, peppermint, freshly baked bread, cut grass, vanilla. Then to taste: fresh mango placed sensitively on the lips, dates, pineapple, ice cream, apple crumble, chocolate, red grapes. Then touch: sea shells, fur, stones, dough, crystal, wax, fluffy leaves, fir cones. Next, we were invited to turn and reach out our fingertips to the person next to us. I turned and with a hair's breadth of gentleness touched the very tips of the fingers next to mine. \"Just explore these hands with your sense of touch,\" a velvet voice intoned. So we played, these hands and my hands, blindfolds still in place - fingers were intertwined, palms touched palms, thumbs stroked thumbs. A sweet tenderness. An innocence. My white-dressed child was happy to play this game. Finally, we were invited to remove our blindfolds. I opened my eyes. They had been Simon's hands. Somehow he had managed to get himself placed next to me. (I discovered later that he had told one of the helpers we were a couple.) His conquest was going well. I felt okay with him now. He smiled at me. We turned and looked at the room filled with candles and beautiful statues of the god Shiva making love to the goddess Shakti. There were also many-armed symbols of love and the celebration of sexuality. My eye was caught by a large pink crystal ornament in the shape of an erect penis. I imagined putting one on the coffee table in my sitting room for the neighbours to admire. I'd say, \"That, Mrs Jones? Oh it's just a little souvenir of Hereford that I picked up. Do you like it?\" But here, in the candlelight, they looked beautiful. I guess the penis gets a lot of bad press. Women complain about its misuse or how much men are led by it, or deride it when it goes wrinkly or tell jokes about it. Men complain that it isn't big enough or doesn't work well enough, or gets them into trouble or is too active or not active enough. Here the penis was named \"Vajra\" (meaning thunderbolt) and was to be celebrated. So we feasted our eyes on erect crystal peni (plural of penis?), then cuddled like children, went our separate ways and went to sleep. And here ended the first day. Over breakfast, the other participants enquired as to whether we were a couple. \"We're not sure,\" he said. \"No, this weekend is an experiment,\" I smiled. The deception was complete. They all thought that we were a long-term couple pretending not to be. We touched like a couple, we related like a couple. It was fun. An easy game to play. Most of the first morning was taken up with the now familiar \"sharing\" process. We were 22 participants this time, sitting on a circle of cushions. They had been careful to arrange an equal number of men and women. The leaders of the workshops were an odd pair who, of course, weren't a couple. The man would definitely have won the award for the least attractive male in the room. He was about 50 going on 60, overweight, had longish, straggly hair that needed a wash, comical glasses and a large and unfortunate gap between his two front teeth. I wasn't going to be signing up for any private lessons. In her introduction, the woman told us, \"I've had six children by six different men.\" An impressive track record by any standards. And she went on: \"I've always been interested in sexuality.\" I'd guessed that. She was also overweight, but she managed to carry her weight like an expression of her sexuality and it made her even more voluptuous somehow. They wouldn't have won any prizes in a fitness competition. But then, I considered, if they'd looked like Barbie and Ken, and she'd started by telling us that she'd just had a facelift, they'd hardly have been in a position to teach self-acceptance. They were as honest and open as it was possible to be; they knew their subject and, like all these new age facilitators, they breathed love. The sharing was touching, as it always is. Happy couples that had somehow lost their way sexually. Old couples who had lost it completely. Newlyweds who wanted to do the sex thing really well. Young couples who were just there to have fun. And then the singles, brave people who wanted to learn this stuff and were not waiting for Mr or Ms Right to come along. Those who admitted, with great courage, that they felt clumsy sexually or just lacked confidence. Simon and I said that we had come to learn as much as we could and to put it into practice. We were so convincing it was silly. The rest of the morning was mainly loosening up and playing games. Disco dancing - some energetic, some slow, some raunchy - invitations to pull faces at each other, grab bums or argue with each other in non-existent languages. There was even an invitation to say \"fuck off\" to everyone. Tantric ice-breakers. It was easy and fun. Then lunch. Vegetarian, of course. Simon rushed off to make an important phone call to New York. I sat and ate tofu with a young Chinese professor from Oxford. He had been raised by Jesuit priests and was so cross with what they had denied him in terms of his sexual education that he didn't seem to notice that they had given him such a good academic education he was now the leader in his field. I suggested that he wrote his next PhD on the subject of tantric sex. Suddenly his eyes lit up and being an academic didn't seem to promise such a dry future as he'd thought. Simon and I ignored each other. We were a couple, after all. When the first exercise of the afternoon started, the instruction was, \"Bonded couples work together - everyone else choose a partner for this exercise.\" Simon simply walked straight over to me. Of course, I could have said no. But I was being offered unconditional love and support and, having touched his fingers, I didn't really want to turn him down. The afternoon lesson was about exploring masculine and feminine energy. \"Walk round the room and celebrate your gender. As you make eye-contact with someone, say the words 'I am a woman' if you are a woman, and 'I am a man' if you are a man - to each person you meet. It can be playful, vulnerable, strong, sexy, seductive or however you like. Say this to both the men and to the women.\" Most of the time in these workshops I am filled with a feeling of unconditional acceptance of everyone. I make use of \"the inner beauty I see in you\" exercise I'd picked up at another workshop. But not always. Sometimes the old bitter, twisted cynic steps in. So, when some of these men walked up to me and said, \"I am a man\", I thought, \"No, I'm afraid I don't agree - I have some clue about what a man is, and I can tell you, you ain't it. You have the face of a woman, the energy of a woman, the voice of a woman. Have you ever ridden a motorbike? Initiated anything? Punched someone? Drunk beer? Had sex? It certainly doesn't look like it!\" However, I didn't say all this, of course. I simply smiled and gave the required response: \"And I am a woman.\" Then the facilitators said, \"And that is only half the truth, because inside every man is a woman and inside every woman is a man.\" So then we were to repeat the exercise. My inner masculine was very happy being allowed to speak. Going around the room saying, \"I am a man\", seemed like stating the obvious. The feminine and sensitive men were probably thinking, \"Yes, God help us.\" But I knew by now that as I've been a single father as well as a single mother all my daughter's life my inner masculine is not hard for me to access. Even an astrologer had told me as much. And some of these men, none of whom was gay, now seemed to be nearer the truth. \"I am a woman,\" they were saying. I was thinking, \"I knew that already.\" Other men were afraid to say this, so they fooled around, went into \"camp\", put on silly voices, acted like little girls. Not so my thin \"bonded partner\". He walked straight up to me, every inch the masculine energy, and said quite clearly, \"I am a woman.\" He made it so easy. He was completely comfortable with his masculine energy and completely comfortable with his feminine energy. He didn't need to hide it, disguise it or apologise for it. He simply stated it. And he was happy with me saying \"I am a man\" as a simple fact. He didn't seem to be judging me for how comfortable I was with that statement. I suppose he'd already told me I was a goddess. Perhaps he really did accept me as I was. That was a good thing to know before the next exercise. The instructions began: \"Kneel opposite your partner. The woman likes to give out her energy through her heart. The man needs to receive through his heart. He likes to give out his energy through his sex. She needs to receive him through her sex. When this works, a circle is created.\" Sounds so simple, doesn't it? This is what we were to experience using our breathing. I breathed out, making a movement with my hand from my heart to his. He breathed in to receive me, then he breathed out, making a movement with his hand from his sexual organs to mine, and I breathed in, moving my hand toward my \"sex\". Now, before your imagination runs away with you, I should add that there was no touching and this was only an exercise about the transfer of energy. But with eye-contact being maintained at all times, you can imagine that this was still fairly intimate. In fact, \"fairly intimate\" is a bit of an understatement. It was one of the most intimate exercises I'd ever done in a seminar. Then we were to reverse it, to experience the energy the other way round. The woman also needs to give out energy through her sexuality and receive with her heart, and it is important for both partners to experience both roles. A little empathy leads to a lot of understanding. Then, just when I was getting totally overwhelmed, they announced dinner. I listened to a woman who was there alone. \"I have been bisexual in the past,\" she said, \"but I feel that I now want to have a committed relationship with a man.\" Yes, her and a million of my other single female friends. \"I would love to do the one-year training course with a partner. But the one-year singles course I'm not so sure about.\" I choked on my lentil soup. \"The what? The one-year couples training? You mean they do a one-year course in all this?\" \"The couples course starts in June next year. It's five four-day residentials and lots of homework in the middle.\" \"What do they teach that takes a year?\" \"Tantra is about learning how to contain the sexual energy that we release at orgasm so that the pleasure becomes implosive instead of explosive, or you can rest in the pleasure for as long as you want to. When you can consciously contain this energy, it takes you to higher states of consciousness, where sexuality and spirituality meet. They can't hope to teach that in two days. This is just a taster weekend.\" \"It sounds wonderful.\" \"Will you and Simon be doing it? Taking the course, I mean?\" I felt I had to come clean with her. \"I'll tell you the truth,\" I confessed, \"we only met yesterday.\" Her jaw fell. \"But you are both so...\" \"Yes, I know,\" I said hastily, lest she have a chance to finish the sentence. \"It is rather amazing, isn't it? But will we be doing the couples course? I really couldn't say.\" She started to laugh. We drank coffee. I liked her a lot. If only I could have that change of sexual preference, life would be so much easier. \"But anyway...\" she lowered her voice, \"we have to remember that we are here to work on our own sexual growth and understanding. It's really not about who we are with. The real journey is with ourselves.\" Suddenly, I saw Sister Alison from the convent I'd visited sitting in front of me. \"The real journey, Isabel, is with yourself.\" Good grief, I'm even told this on a tantric sex weekend? Blast the truths of life. The evening of this course happened to hit Halloween night. They weren't going to let an opportunity like that go by. We were invited to take a different partner. Only, of course, the \"bonded couples\" worked together. Simon, my lifetime lover, appeared at my side. This next exercise wasn't easy. They wanted to use the \"night of dark powers\" for all it was worth. The facilitators spoke of darkness, the subconscious, of what was forbidden, of what had been banished. Then the instructions: \"The man should hold the woman in his arms as she goes on an imaginative journey in her mind, down into the deep darkness below death to see what is there.\" He held me in his arms. I didn't really want to go anywhere beyond death with him. But he was so loving and supportive, it would have been churlish not to play. I listened to the velvet voice of the fat man with the gap in his teeth and descended into the depths of my mind, where I was surprised to meet a wild dancing god. Or maybe he was an Indian sexual demon. I watched in amazement as he leaped and hurled himself around. He was okay safely hidden in my mind's eye. But then the voice said, \"Now bring this energy into you and bring the images to life. Get up, dance.\" So I got up and danced. I flung myself around. There was a kind of freedom, but as I looked into Simon's eyes, the support of the male Shiva, filled with his promised unconditional love, I knew I was pretending. I felt disconnected from my experience and self-conscious. It reminded me of times as an actress, when I'd been on stage and known that I was acting badly. I had not become the Indian sexual demon I saw. I was observing myself being a fraud and still dancing, anyway. I did the exercise, but it wasn't real. Then it was his turn. I got to hold him while he did his inner journey. I don't know where he went, but he certainly wasn't pretending. He was crying in my arms. I stroked his hair, being the all-loving mother that I had been instructed to personify. But when he got up to do his dance, I left the mother role right behind. Where, I asked myself, had this man learned to move? I thought I was a trained dancer - but ballet class at the Royal Academy of Dancing was never like this. As he started to dance, he played with his sexual energy. I watched him and I could see him wait until he sensed the glimmers of arousal. He moved slowly at first, delighting in his senses. This was too much. I was glad we were in candlelight by this time, as my face must have been redder than the satin cushion I was sitting on. He was, quite simply, one of the most erotic dancers I had ever seen. True, he was displeasingly thin, but this expression of sexuality meant I could generously tolerate that. Have you ever seen anyone dance in their sexual energy? It made me shake to watch him. Then the exercise finished. We were invited to stay in the room as long as we liked but to \"please respect the sacred space\". Which, I guess, meant, in case anyone had done the exercise too well, no bonking. So the couples lay and cuddled and chatted and laughed. We just lay and held each other. It was so easy to be held. I could have imagined this exercise with some of my former partners. They'd have been saying, \"Well, you didn't get that exercise at all, did you, Isabel? I knew you were pretending. And what really irritated me about what you did was...\" My ex-husband would have said, \"Nice try.\" This man just held me. So you can imagine he was a great trial to be with. Then, one by one and two by two, we all went our separate ways and went to sleep. And here ended the second day. The Sunday exercises were harder still. We never celebrated All Saints' Day like this in the Church of England. \"And this morning, my brothers and sisters, we are going to celebrate this day of the Lord by our practice of sexual breathing. We will then read the Song Of Solomon and sing Hymn number 317, Glad That I Live Am I.\" Here I was praising God in my own sweet way. We were to learn sexual breathing and how to build the energy in the pelvis with pelvic rocking. Also how to hold the sexual energy using the pelvic muscles. This sounds raunchy, but after the Goddess workshop it was surprisingly sensitive. After all, there had been no nudity and everyone was free to participate, or not, as they wished. Sexual breathing was another exercise to be done while maintaining eye-contact with your partner. I was touched that the woman was to find her rhythm of pelvic rocking and then the man was to take his rhythm from her. This proved to be a bit like dancing. No sooner did I establish a rhythm - squeeze pelvic muscle, breathe, rock forward, release pelvic muscle, exhale - than I'd lose it again. The Shakti incarnation of the female facilitator encouraged me. \"Be patient - this is the first time you've done this exercise together.\" Too right it was. Then suddenly it was Sunday lunchtime and we were in the \"closing sharing\". It was so tender. The couples said that they had rediscovered a connection. One man of about 60, there with his wife, cried as he looked at her. The newlyweds said they had found a way forward. The stuck couples said they were unstuck. The singles said what they'd learned and how touched they were by the support of the group. One woman who had come alone had never done any work of this kind before, and had become less and less terrified as the weekend progressed - by the end, she was finally able to speak. And as for me, I felt like a whole person again. I had been taught not to apologise for having a \"well-developed masculine side\". I am a woman, after all, and so to be a beautiful woman with positive masculine qualities of strength and vitality is often a bonus. My ability to see the male point of view is sometimes so accurate I even amaze myself. But I do still want a real Shiva god around to look after me and I know how to be vulnerable, too. It's true, I am still learning to listen to my feminine side, but she is alive and well and growing in confidence all the time. So maybe I really am evolving? But this is not the end of the story. \"What about Simon?\" I hear you ask. \"What happened next?\" The workshop finished after lunch so that people could enjoy the idyllic countryside. The sun was shining in a blue sky. It was a perfect autumn afternoon. The Indian goddess we had travelled up with was going back with one of the couples. It all seemed too good to be true. It was. Simon appeared after lunch in a suit instead of his \"walking though the countryside\" clothes. \"I'm afraid if you want a lift in my car I have to leave in 10 minutes.\" I couldn't believe it - his mobile phone was actually ringing. \"I'm sorry, I have a meeting in London at six and I...\" \"That's okay,\" I sighed, looking at the leaves falling over the orchard, \"I'll get my bag.\" I knew he was going to be worried that I may have got a little fond of him. He was male, after all. \"You're afraid I'm going to ring you or something, aren't you?\" I asked him. We were half an hour from London. He'd spent the first three hours asking me about my life and telling me how wonderful I'd been. \"It's just that... I do have a... sort of... relationship,\" he said. \"Er, sort of ?\" I requested a definition of this interesting adjective. \"Well, okay, a long-term relationship, I guess.\" \"How long have you known her?\" I asked, having learned over the weekend to be completely honest and open with this man. \"About 10 years.\" He took a phone call. \"Seven tonight? No, that's fine. See you then.\" \"How long do you expect to know her for?\" I asked in a matter-of-fact voice. He smiled at the thought of her. \"The rest of my life, I expect.\" I was not yet speechless. \"And do you live with this woman?\" He wriggled uncomfortably at the inquisition. \"Sometimes.\" \"Sometimes? How can you live with a woman sometimes? Do you live with her or don't you?\" \"Er, yes.\" \"Simon, this weekend was divided into those with partners and those without. If you have a sexual partner who wasn't present, why on earth didn't you say so? Why didn't you invite her? Why didn't you tell the group? Why didn't you at least tell me? Why didn't you...\" \"Oh dear. I hope you didn't think that we could have had some future together.

With the agreement of the school, they could even find themselves sitting next to their own child, Mr Blunkett told heads at the annual conference of the Secondary Heads Association in Newport, south Wales. </p> <p>The orders would be issued by local magistrate's courts under the instructions of the education authority. In the most serious cases parents could face being fined. A new regime of tougher fines of up \u00a32,500 for parents who condone their children's truanting has already been introduced by Labour, and came into force earlier this month. </p> <p>In a wide ranging speech which many delegates saw as Mr Blunkett's parting shot before a likely move to the Home Office after the election, he told the conference that parents were the root of discipline problems, with a small minority making the lives of teachers \"a daily misery\". </p> <p>In a message to such adults, he said: \"If you give aggro to heads and teachers, if you come on to school premises and you behave in a way which sets an appalling example to your child and to others, if you prevent them from being educated properly and if you refuse to cooperate in making it possible for schools to do their work, we will take action against you.\" </p> <p>At the same time, Mr Blunkett outlined a \u00a34m plan to expand the number of in-school learning support units - so-called sin bins - to take disruptive pupils to be educated out of the classroom. An extra 50 units are planned, mainly for schools outside urban areas. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, welcomed the plans to extend parenting orders, and said his members had experienced many problems at the hands of troublesome parents. He said that on one occasion, under the terms of the 1996 Education Act, he had banned a parent from school who had gone to the home of one of his teachers. </p> <p>\"This is good news for heads, and another weapon in their armoury,\" he said. \"If you simply ban parents, you build up a degree of frustration with parents who are already difficult. Our feelings as heads has been that the balance of rights and responsibilities is wrong. We have all the responsibilities, and the parents have all the rights.\" </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"Clearly it is important to target the parents if they are the root of the problem. But much more needs to be done immediately, such as abolishing appeals panels which are still sending disruptive children who have been excluded back in to the classroom by the truck load.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett also set out further details of the government's new secondary schools strategy, which it hopes will help stem the dip in achievement at the critical Key Stage 3 period for pupils aged between 11 and 14. But plans for schools to concentrate on a minimum of three hours a week in each of English and maths were criticised by heads as \"too prescriptive\". </p> <p>In a questions and answers session Mr Blunkett said he wished he had been able to do more to raise teacher morale.</p>",

In a message to such adults, he said: \"If you give aggro to heads and teachers, if you come on to school premises and you behave in a way which sets an appalling example to your child and to others, if you prevent them from being educated properly and if you refuse to cooperate in making it possible for schools to do their work, we will take action against you.\" At the same time, Mr Blunkett outlined a \u00a34m plan to expand the number of in-school learning support units - so-called sin bins - to take disruptive pupils to be educated out of the classroom. An extra 50 units are planned, mainly for schools outside urban areas. John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, welcomed the plans to extend parenting orders, and said his members had experienced many problems at the hands of troublesome parents. He said that on one occasion, under the terms of the 1996 Education Act, he had banned a parent from school who had gone to the home of one of his teachers. \"This is good news for heads, and another weapon in their armoury,\" he said. \"If you simply ban parents, you build up a degree of frustration with parents who are already difficult. Our feelings as heads has been that the balance of rights and responsibilities is wrong. We have all the responsibilities, and the parents have all the rights.\" Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of School Masters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"Clearly it is important to target the parents if they are the root of the problem. But much more needs to be done immediately, such as abolishing appeals panels which are still sending disruptive children who have been excluded back in to the classroom by the truck load.\" Mr Blunkett also set out further details of the government's new secondary schools strategy, which it hopes will help stem the dip in achievement at the critical Key Stage 3 period for pupils aged between 11 and 14. But plans for schools to concentrate on a minimum of three hours a week in each of English and maths were criticised by heads as \"too prescriptive\". In a questions and answers session Mr Blunkett said he wished he had been able to do more to raise teacher morale.",

Had it become, as I entered my third decade in the job market, rather too extensive? Was it unnecessarily honest to admit baldly that I was 43 years old, or that I had resigned from a previous job partly to spend more time with my children? </p> <p>Yes, yes, and yes, friends replied when I canvassed their advice, I had indeed been peddling quite the wrong resume. One fellow job-seeker 10 years further down the line than me boasted that he had just expunged the entire 1970s from his record. An American friend shrieked in horror when I admitted alluding to my family: \"But that's none of their business - they've got no right to know and it's irrelevant to the job.\" </p> <p>So, it seems, the trick is to highlight one's strengths while hiding the weaknesses; in other words, to spin. But how far should you go, and at what point does spinning cross the line into suppression of the facts, or falsification, or outright lying? </p> <p>According to Control Risks Group (CRG), a security and risk consultancy which provides \"pre-employment screening\" among other services, at least one in four CVs are inaccurate - and the true figure is probably higher still. \"We only see the CV when a prospective employer has selected the candidate for a job,\" said CRG spokeswoman Nicola Hudson. \"But successful candidates are warned that their CV will be screened, so many of them withdraw at that stage.\" </p> <p>Pre-employment screening originated in the US, partly in response to a vast labour market spread across a whole continent: it was impractical for employers to chase up references thousands of miles away. The practice is relatively new in Britain, where the City used to be run as an old boys' network in which everyone knew everyone else and a gentleman's word was his bond. But with the internationalisation of the financial sector and the growing importance of IT - all those blokes in systems can effectively eavesdrop on the boardroom - employee security has assumed far greater importance. As CRG warns in its sales pitch, 70% of fraud against companies is carried out by insiders. </p> <p>Inaccuracies detected by CRG range from small slips of the memory which will probably be overlooked by a prospective employer - a dodgy A-level grade, a date mistyped - via exaggerated current salary claims, to outright lies which will certainly cost the perpetrator his job. \"One candidate claimed a degree from a highly regarded university,\" says Ms Hudson. \"When we checked, he had indeed studied that subject at that university during those three years, but each year he took the first year exams, and each time he failed. Another candidate had worked in the City for several years, then spent five years in New York before coming back. What she didn't mention was that she'd spent the last 18 months in America in jail for fraud.\" </p> <p>Then there are the plausible fantasists who talk themselves into top jobs on the basis of false claims. \"We had one chap who had landed a big job in the City. He professed to be a Falklands war veteran who had a limp from a land mine. We found out that he had changed his name, his limp was from a motorcycle crash, he had never been in the Royal Marines and he had even bought his campaign medals in Portobello Road.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, for the fundamentally honest among us who would nevertheless consider relegating certain less-than-glorious episodes from their CV, omission of key information does count against you. As Ms Hudson explains, CRG will check references to ascertain the real reasons why you left a job or to make sure the dates add up - if there's a missing 10 months, you'll have some explaining to do. </p> <p>So what of the temptation to massage your CV when there is little danger of it being raked over by experts? The biggest danger is that the lies will come back to haunt you - after all, it is easier to be consistent with the truth. One friend recalls a colleague who was doing well at work until he applied for an internal promotion. \"He had to submit a new CV, and when they checked his records they saw it didn't match his original CV. Then they noticed that he was claiming six A-levels in unusual subjects - no one does six obscure A-levels, but he was apparently worried the other people he worked with had university degrees and wanted to compensate.\" </p> <p>So if honesty is the best policy, how should you go about writing that CV? According to Nina Grunfeld, a career and life-change consultant, it doesn't pay to fire off a batch of CVs. Better by far to target a job or company, find out all you can about it, and write a one-off letter - whether or not there is a job going. </p> <p>If a CV is then demanded -and it usually is - it should be tailored to that particular job and be minimal, elegantly laid out on no more than two sides of paper, and with plenty of white space. \"Less is definitely more with a CV,\" she advises. \"Your CV needs to flirt, not to reveal all. It should make you sound so attractive that they want to find out more about you.\" </p> <p>This does not mean it should be gimmicky. Attempting humour may show you don't take the job seriously, while the current trend for adding a photograph or a paragraph of what you hope is elegant prose at the top -\"who I am, what are my goals\" - can be off-putting. </p> <p>Ms Grunfeld also advises that you shouldn't worry too much about keeping personal details such as age, marital status and parental responsibilities to yourself, if only because they are bound to find out sooner or later. \"And if their only interest is in getting more out of you for less money, then you have to ask if you really want to work for these people.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>If the prime minister has learned nothing else from the foot and mouth crisis, perhaps the latest twist might have taught him a useful lesson: keep mum whenever a camera is around.</p> <p>Yesterday the PM was engaged in agreeable pre-summit chit-chat in Stockholm with his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, and the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi. As the three men small-talked, a TV cameraman hovered, gathering the usual \"wallpaper\" shots that are seen, but rarely heard, on the evening news. This time, however, the camera's microphone picked up more than the usual low hubbub of clinking glasses. It caught Mr Prodi asking the PM how long he had left before he must decide the date for the election. The Italian guessed about a month. \"Ten days,\" came back the exasperated reply, in a voice that said, \"Now do you see the pressure I'm under?\" Mr Prodi rocked back on his heels and, in perfect English idiom, said \"No kidding.\"</p> <p>The fact that Mr Blair's candid admission came less than an hour after his official spokesman had told reporters the PM was not \"remotely\" interested in election timing - only the media and the Tories discussed such trifles, he said - added to the embarrassment of the episode. But it also confirmed what many had already suspected: that Downing Street is racked by its dilemma over when to call the general election. That anxiety deepened yesterday when the government's own panel of epidemiologists warned that, on current trends, foot and mouth will soon be a massive epidemic, with the current 500 cases becoming 4,000 by June. The original line from Number 10 - that everything is under control with no need to change plans - seemed to be eroding.</p> <p>The shape of the dilemma will be very clear in Mr Blair's mind this weekend. He will have heard the case for delay from Conservatives, farmers and their supporters in the press. They insist that, with the countryside paralysed by foot and mouth, to call a general election for May 3 would be to disenfranchise rural voters. Their movement would be restricted, barring them from the town meetings and village square hustings that are the heart of any campaign. Even turning up at a polling station would be impossible for men and women confined to their farms, say the delay camp.</p> <p>Beyond the humdrum matter of logistics, there is the less definable question of national mood. The country is in bleak spirit, distressed by the sight of funeral pyres and mass animal slaughter. To call an election now would be like holding a knees-up 24 hours after a death in the family: it would be unseemly. Besides, as Hugo Young has argued on these pages, elections are more than mechanical exercises aimed at replacing MPs and ministers. An election should be a national jamboree, a celebration of democracy. If Mr Blair were to call one now, it would be a sombre affair, depriving the nation of the right to enjoy its moment of decision. Only narrow party interest and a determination to cash in on Labour's current poll lead would compel Mr Blair to go to the country now - a full year before he must.</p> <p>These are substantial arguments, but they should not prevail. As we have set out before, the logistical objections soon melt away. Movement is not as severely restricted as the TV pictures suggest: rural schools, which double as polling stations, are still open. People can still get about. Most campaigning these days is not on the village green but on TV and radio and, where necessary, voting can be done by post. As for the matter of self-interest, this argument can be turned on its head. For calling an election now would not be in any party leader's interest. For one thing, there is bound to be a rural backlash, which could hurt Labour in the 120-odd rural seats it won in 1997. Those who say the mood is sombre are right. But that, too, would cost Mr Blair, depriving him of the emotional lift of a fresh mandate granted from a cheerful, hopeful nation. An election victory against the backdrop of foot and mouth will not be the festive, confirming moment of Labour dreams.</p> <p>So it would not be self-interested to call a May 3 election. But Mr Blair should do it all the same - in the national interest. For one thing, a postponement will be seen worldwide as a declaration that Britain is in crisis; tourism would suffer even more than it is doing already. More seriously, all this speculation about timing is hobbling the government, weakening its authority - turning it into an administration effectively at the end of its term even though there is one more year left to run.</p> <p>The foot and mouth outbreak requires a government with strength; so too does the coming recession, now being shaped in the United States and Japan. Labour cannot lead if it is constantly fending off questions about dates with destiny. Mr Blair should nerve himself for the wave of abuse that will surely follow, but do the brave thing all the same. Call it for May 3.</p>",

The Italian guessed about a month. \"Ten days,\" came back the exasperated reply, in a voice that said, \"Now do you see the pressure I'm under?\" Mr Prodi rocked back on his heels and, in perfect English idiom, said \"No kidding.\" The fact that Mr Blair's candid admission came less than an hour after his official spokesman had told reporters the PM was not \"remotely\" interested in election timing - only the media and the Tories discussed such trifles, he said - added to the embarrassment of the episode. But it also confirmed what many had already suspected: that Downing Street is racked by its dilemma over when to call the general election. That anxiety deepened yesterday when the government's own panel of epidemiologists warned that, on current trends, foot and mouth will soon be a massive epidemic, with the current 500 cases becoming 4,000 by June. The original line from Number 10 - that everything is under control with no need to change plans - seemed to be eroding. The shape of the dilemma will be very clear in Mr Blair's mind this weekend. He will have heard the case for delay from Conservatives, farmers and their supporters in the press. They insist that, with the countryside paralysed by foot and mouth, to call a general election for May 3 would be to disenfranchise rural voters. Their movement would be restricted, barring them from the town meetings and village square hustings that are the heart of any campaign. Even turning up at a polling station would be impossible for men and women confined to their farms, say the delay camp. Beyond the humdrum matter of logistics, there is the less definable question of national mood. The country is in bleak spirit, distressed by the sight of funeral pyres and mass animal slaughter. To call an election now would be like holding a knees-up 24 hours after a death in the family: it would be unseemly. Besides, as Hugo Young has argued on these pages, elections are more than mechanical exercises aimed at replacing MPs and ministers. An election should be a national jamboree, a celebration of democracy. If Mr Blair were to call one now, it would be a sombre affair, depriving the nation of the right to enjoy its moment of decision. Only narrow party interest and a determination to cash in on Labour's current poll lead would compel Mr Blair to go to the country now - a full year before he must. These are substantial arguments, but they should not prevail. As we have set out before, the logistical objections soon melt away. Movement is not as severely restricted as the TV pictures suggest: rural schools, which double as polling stations, are still open. People can still get about. Most campaigning these days is not on the village green but on TV and radio and, where necessary, voting can be done by post. As for the matter of self-interest, this argument can be turned on its head. For calling an election now would not be in any party leader's interest. For one thing, there is bound to be a rural backlash, which could hurt Labour in the 120-odd rural seats it won in 1997. Those who say the mood is sombre are right. But that, too, would cost Mr Blair, depriving him of the emotional lift of a fresh mandate granted from a cheerful, hopeful nation. An election victory against the backdrop of foot and mouth will not be the festive, confirming moment of Labour dreams. So it would not be self-interested to call a May 3 election. But Mr Blair should do it all the same - in the national interest. For one thing, a postponement will be seen worldwide as a declaration that Britain is in crisis; tourism would suffer even more than it is doing already. More seriously, all this speculation about timing is hobbling the government, weakening its authority - turning it into an administration effectively at the end of its term even though there is one more year left to run. The foot and mouth outbreak requires a government with strength; so too does the coming recession, now being shaped in the United States and Japan. Labour cannot lead if it is constantly fending off questions about dates with destiny. Mr Blair should nerve himself for the wave of abuse that will surely follow, but do the brave thing all the same. Call it for May 3.",

As Downing Street was insisting that the prime minister was focusing fully on tackling the crisis, Mr Blair was caught on camera at the European Union economic summit in Stockholm revealing his self-imposed deadline to EU commission president Romano Prodi. The remarks further fuelled controversy over whether the government should go to the country in the midst of the epidemic. One team of scientists yesterday forecast an eventual high of more than 4,400 cases - almost twice as many as the 1967-8 outbreak, while another team warned that the whole country could be affected. All three teams reporting on the outbreak agreed that existing measures were failing to cope. As Mr Blair acknowledged that eliminating the disease would be \"a long haul\", the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, gave the clearest signs yet that the government is about to order a limited livestock vaccination programme. Mr Blair's comments, made while he was unaware that he was being filmed, came in response to a question from Mr Prodi over how long the prime minister had before deciding whether to go to the country on May 3. His reply - \"10 days\" - which he confirmed publicly later, prompted fresh pressure from the Conservatives over election speculation. The party called for the setting up of a crisis cabinet along the lines of a war cabinet, in which the prime minister would chair daily meetings of key ministers. Tory chairman Michael Ancram said: \"Once again he has shown his contempt for the British people. Mr Blair doesn't have to hold an election for another year, yet he is already telling Mr Prodi that he has 10 days to call an election. \"This is despite the fact that the countryside and the rural economy is being devastated by foot and mouth.\" A survey carried out in Mr Blair's Sedgefield constituency by the Northern Echo newspaper showed more than half the voters were against a May 3 poll. The severity of yesterday's scientific forecasts prompted new questions within Labour ranks over the likelihood of a May 3 general election, though insiders still indicated that Mr Blair would go to the country then, as planned. Some sources suggested that an escalation of the crisis in fact made a deferred date less likely, since the epidemic was expected to continue for months.

Another reader featured overleaf, Peter Davies of London, claims he has already established from the OFT that SVR means \"openly marketed competitive rate\". If so, then borrowers with contracts which promise a discount from the SVR should be able to have that discount applied to the new SVR. However, the OFT declined to comment on the interpretation to Jobs &amp; Money. </p> <p>The banking ombudsman also confirmed that it has already begun to receive complaints in the form of \"deadlock\" letters which have to be issued by the lender before a borrower can take their case to the ombudsman. Judging from the number of letters to Jobs &amp; Money threatening to go to the ombudsman, its case load is about to increase rapidly. However, a spokeswoman for the ombudsman says the average case takes six months before it reaches adjudication. But unlike the OFT, the ombudsman can force lenders to make direct compensation payments of up to \u00a3100,000.

Come to think of it, Sycamore House, quietly resting beside a quiet street in the quiet village of Little Shelford just outside Cambridge, probably is someone's home. A nice home, too, though there's nothing particularly special about it; nothing to attract the eye of a Pevsner, say, or a Meades. It's decent, trim, almost handsome, in a modest kind of way, and it is the domain of Michael and Susan Sharpe - he cooks, she looks after you. </p> <p>She looked after Humphrey and me with the pleasantness of true hospitality. There was nothing showy in the performance - if anything, it was a bit understated - but we felt in good, kindly hands. Then again, there's nothing really showy about Sycamore House, unless you count the wine list. It is a long, long time since I've come across one that is so stuffed with goodies and at prices that even your local wine shop would be hard to match.

      "bodyText": "It was like going into someone's home. Come to think of it, Sycamore House, quietly resting beside a quiet street in the quiet village of Little Shelford just outside Cambridge, probably is someone's home. A nice home, too, though there's nothing particularly special about it; nothing to attract the eye of a Pevsner, say, or a Meades. It's decent, trim, almost handsome, in a modest kind of way, and it is the domain of Michael and Susan Sharpe - he cooks, she looks after you. She looked after Humphrey and me with the pleasantness of true hospitality. There was nothing showy in the performance - if anything, it was a bit understated - but we felt in good, kindly hands. Then again, there's nothing really showy about Sycamore House, unless you count the wine list. It is a long, long time since I've come across one that is so stuffed with goodies and at prices that even your local wine shop would be hard to match. Humphrey and I made do with a bottle of Les Fiefs de Lagrange 1996, the second wine from the impeccable Chteau Lagrange, which was the knockout drop I knew it to be and, at all of \u00a322, well, almost a giveaway.

      "bodyText": "A historic shift of emphasis in United States military deployment from Europe to Asia, with China supplanting Russia as America's principal foe, is at the heart of the Bush administration's long awaited defence strategy review, according to reports in Washington. Outlines of the potentially epochal rethink of the US's global strategic priorities were given to President George Bush by his defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld at a private meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the Washington Post reported yesterday. \"The president was complimentary, he appreciated the policy discussion, and gave the indication that the topics were indeed what he had in mind,\" a Pentagon official told the paper. More than 50 years after the struggle to deter the Soviet Union in Europe became the centrepiece of US military strategy in the aftermath of the second world war, the Rumsfeld review has concluded that the Pacific Ocean should now become the most important focus of US military deployments, with China now perceived as the principal threat to American global dominance. The review says, in effect, that Washington should abandon the long-standing doctrine that the US military must always be prepared to fight two major world conflicts simultaneously, the reports quote officials as saying. By elevating China to the status of global enemy number one, the review clearly foreshadows an American turn away from Europe, or at least from the levels of US engagement and attention which have existed for the lifetime of most Europeans. Mr Bush ordered the strategy review immediately on taking office. It is the most important of three complementary reviews intended to shape US military priorities in the 21st century. The other two are on nuclear weapons and missile defence options, and on service pay and conditions. The huge distances involved in the Pacific mean that the Pentagon must give additional priority to \"long-range power projection\", the report says. This means putting fresh resources into airlift capacity to enable the US to move troops, vehicles and weapons many thousands of miles from bases in America to the frontline in Asia at short notice. The report says the threat from hostile missiles is likely to become so serious that the US can no longer afford to risk its largest and most expensive ships, the Nimitz class aircraft carriers, in forward positions. As a result, the navy will be told to stop building big ships and to concentrate on speed and manoeuvrability, including a new generation of smaller carriers, to avoid them becoming targets. The threat from weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, against American military targets means that US allies may begin to question the advisability of allowing Washington to have bases in their countries, the Pentagon suggests.

      "body": "<p>New Labour came to power determined to make radical changes in both the powers and structure of local government. Hilary Armstrong, the local government minister and a member of the party's national executive when the reforms were devised, says that the policymakers set out to remedy two separate but related problems. \"Councils were becoming more and more irrelevant as they were bypassed by the Tories.\" And their \"poor quality\" produced an \"inadequate delivery of services\".</p> <p>So there was a real desire to rehabilitate, as well as to improve, the town and county halls. But Labour's reputation was suffering from \"the continuing bashing of councils\" by the Conservative government. Ms Armstrong's judgment on the esteem in which local government is held is confirmed by the polls which Kent, like other major authorities, regularly conducts. They show that, although the services which councils provide are highly valued, the councils themselves are regarded with very little respect. Reinstating their old powers would have provoked the allegation that the party of moderation and probity was encouraging municipal extremists who subsidised their wild habits by claiming expenses for civic trips to exotic locations. Rehabilitation and change had to go hand in hand.</p> <p>A new council constitution was devised which, it was hoped, would reconnect local government to the people it aimed to serve and by encouraging real democracy guarantee both popularity and efficiency. It required councillors to work more closely with community leaders and regularly consult the communities themselves. The popular will was to be efficiently implemented by a system which, instead of wasting time on endless committee meetings, defined what Ms Armstrong called, \"clear aims and objectives\" and put in place \"mechanisms both for achieving them and scrutinising the efficiency with which they are delivered\". Cabinets - some of them led by elected mayors - were to become the executive branch of local government. Councillors who were not included in the inner circle would \"probe\" the cabinets' decisions and \"guarantee that the services were being delivered effectively\".</p> <p>The problem, for Ms Armstrong and her government, is that most councillors do not believe that the municipal future will be improved by the separation of powers. Council leaders love the cabinet system. But the rank-and-file - both opposition members and majority group \"backbenchers\" - say the new efficiency is just an acceptable way of describing the democracy bypass.</p> <p>The cynicism of the excluded majority is increased by Whitehall's silence on the subject of local government reorganisation. Real efficiency and genuine accountability require unitary authorities. In the two-tier system most voters do not know where the county's powers begin and the borough's end. Ms Armstrong \"accepts the logic\" of abolishing the counties, but a battle with the shires is not to New Labour's taste.</p> <p>Ms Armstrong also accepts that, despite the reforms, the party caucus still dominates a handful of councils. \"That\", she says, \"is because we have not changed the culture of many of our councils.\" Perhaps so. But culture takes time to change. And before the adjustment is made there is not much incentive to sacrifice family and job prospects for the privilege of \"probing\" a council's cabinet. It does not compare, in interest or esteem, with running schools or managing a town's housing estate.</p> <p>Yet the government has explicitly excluded local authorities from the control of education, and hard economic reality is forcing the sale of municipal housing. Much of the old incentive to serve has gone. It is hard to imagine that the reforms will attract many men and women of conspicuous talent apart from a handful of potential full-time town and county managers. Local government - for better or worse - is about to become a career rather than a public service.</p> <p>A s things stand, even the professional managers will be deeply frustrated by the limitations which are placed on their freedom to manage. Hilary Armstrong concedes that \"there is too much ring fencing\". The notion that councils should only receive government grants in return for the performance of specific tasks is as old as the Public Health Act of 1875. But over the years the demands have grown more detailed, without a clearly defined purpose.</p> <p>If the rules, tests and checks are intended to guarantee the local implementation of national policy, councils have become no more than agents of central government. The alternative explanation is that the injunctions and interdicts are necessary to prevent councils from squandering still scarce resources. But the age of local government extravagance is past. In that one particular, the culture has already changed. Whitehall still possesses powers to \"cap\" unreasonable increases in council tax. But it is years since ministers thought it necessary to use them. Councillors dismiss the claims that the regulations are intended to ensure efficiency and argue that excessive controls are inhibiting, rather than enhancing, the effective provision of services.</p> <p>The problems of bureaucracy and flexibility explode into a budget crisis when new regulations increase local authorities' responsibilities - either setting new tasks or improving the standards at which the old ones must be performed - without providing the extra funds to finance the extra duties.</p> <p>Peter Gilroy, of Kent, quotes the local government association's judgment on a whole financial year. There is a national overspend on social services of \u00a3205m. It represents inadequate government funding, not unacceptable local extravagance. Often, when councils fail to live up to the government's expectation, it is because they cannot afford to improve.</p> <p>Nor can many boroughs afford to maintain the service which has been at the heart of local government since Disraeli's Artisans Dwelling Act. The reduction in municipal housing is largely the result of increased prosperity. But Ms Armstrong and Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham council, believe that there is no immediate hope of removing \"the stigma of council tenancy\". Both realise that to end that it is necessary to spend millions of pounds on improvements.</p> <p>Improvement in the quality of council housing requires the estates to be separated from the general control of the councils which now own them. The repairs and renovations have to be financed by borrowing money against the actual property. That is not possible while they are just another division of the local authority with their mortgageable assets lumped in with the other council property. So most council houses will change ownership over the next half dozen years because of necessity rather than ideology. It will leave a big hole in the municipal policy agenda.</p> <p>All the signs are that it will be filled with the idea of the moment, urban regeneration - a policy which councils can pursue under the legal umbrella of their new duty to promote \"economic, social and environmental well-being\". When Hilary Armstrong told Sandy Bruce-Lockhart (the leader of Kent county council) the phrase must be interpreted \"in the head of the beholder\", she was doing more than pay homage to local autonomy. The government is not certain how far down the commercial road councils can go without the courts - English and European - ruling that they are acting ultra vires. Councils will be expected to see how far they can extend their frontiers into ground previously occupied by private developers.</p> <p>So far they have played safe by pursuing partnership arrangements. But if Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive, is to be believed, when the new reforms are implemented and all the big cities have directly elected executive mayors, the major boroughs will \"score more highly as businesses than as democratic institutions\". The risk will then be that councils will become more concerned with commerce than welfare, particularly if the executive mayors have no party allegiance. It is unlikely a municipal business would accept Joe Chamberlain's aim for local government - \"equalising the condition of men and limiting the extremes which now form such a blot on our social system\".</p> <p>The leaders of Birmingham and Preston councils will both argue that their regeneration plans have a direct social objective. Councils still think of themselves as agencies of social welfare. But for how long?</p> <p>The chilling commercial language used by Kent's social services director to describe the purchase of home care - combined with the gap of \u00a3206m between what the government calculates needs to be spent on welfare and the funds it makes available - shows that the new culture will have a harder edge. Since most welfare services seem likely to be bought for private agencies, there will be very little incentive to become councillors in the hope of directly removing the \"blots for a social system\". Local government may only attract men and women with an enthusiasm for procurement and accountancy.</p> <p>To describe a change is not, necessarily, to condemn it. Society has moved on and local government must move with it. But the Civil Gospel, as preached by Joe Chamberlain, is dying. The hopes and ideas of men and women who wanted to clear the slums, clean the air, improve the schools and care for the sick cannot be realised by councils acting as agents for the government and employing outside contractors. It is hard to imagine a modern Joe Chamberlain believing that it is a \"sorry exchange to give up the council chamber for the cabinet\".</p>",

The cynicism of the excluded majority is increased by Whitehall's silence on the subject of local government reorganisation. Real efficiency and genuine accountability require unitary authorities. In the two-tier system most voters do not know where the county's powers begin and the borough's end. Ms Armstrong \"accepts the logic\" of abolishing the counties, but a battle with the shires is not to New Labour's taste. Ms Armstrong also accepts that, despite the reforms, the party caucus still dominates a handful of councils. \"That\", she says, \"is because we have not changed the culture of many of our councils.\" Perhaps so. But culture takes time to change. And before the adjustment is made there is not much incentive to sacrifice family and job prospects for the privilege of \"probing\" a council's cabinet. It does not compare, in interest or esteem, with running schools or managing a town's housing estate. Yet the government has explicitly excluded local authorities from the control of education, and hard economic reality is forcing the sale of municipal housing. Much of the old incentive to serve has gone. It is hard to imagine that the reforms will attract many men and women of conspicuous talent apart from a handful of potential full-time town and county managers. Local government - for better or worse - is about to become a career rather than a public service. A s things stand, even the professional managers will be deeply frustrated by the limitations which are placed on their freedom to manage. Hilary Armstrong concedes that \"there is too much ring fencing\". The notion that councils should only receive government grants in return for the performance of specific tasks is as old as the Public Health Act of 1875. But over the years the demands have grown more detailed, without a clearly defined purpose. If the rules, tests and checks are intended to guarantee the local implementation of national policy, councils have become no more than agents of central government. The alternative explanation is that the injunctions and interdicts are necessary to prevent councils from squandering still scarce resources. But the age of local government extravagance is past. In that one particular, the culture has already changed. Whitehall still possesses powers to \"cap\" unreasonable increases in council tax. But it is years since ministers thought it necessary to use them. Councillors dismiss the claims that the regulations are intended to ensure efficiency and argue that excessive controls are inhibiting, rather than enhancing, the effective provision of services. The problems of bureaucracy and flexibility explode into a budget crisis when new regulations increase local authorities' responsibilities - either setting new tasks or improving the standards at which the old ones must be performed - without providing the extra funds to finance the extra duties. Peter Gilroy, of Kent, quotes the local government association's judgment on a whole financial year. There is a national overspend on social services of \u00a3205m. It represents inadequate government funding, not unacceptable local extravagance. Often, when councils fail to live up to the government's expectation, it is because they cannot afford to improve. Nor can many boroughs afford to maintain the service which has been at the heart of local government since Disraeli's Artisans Dwelling Act. The reduction in municipal housing is largely the result of increased prosperity. But Ms Armstrong and Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham council, believe that there is no immediate hope of removing \"the stigma of council tenancy\". Both realise that to end that it is necessary to spend millions of pounds on improvements. Improvement in the quality of council housing requires the estates to be separated from the general control of the councils which now own them. The repairs and renovations have to be financed by borrowing money against the actual property. That is not possible while they are just another division of the local authority with their mortgageable assets lumped in with the other council property. So most council houses will change ownership over the next half dozen years because of necessity rather than ideology. It will leave a big hole in the municipal policy agenda. All the signs are that it will be filled with the idea of the moment, urban regeneration - a policy which councils can pursue under the legal umbrella of their new duty to promote \"economic, social and environmental well-being\". When Hilary Armstrong told Sandy Bruce-Lockhart (the leader of Kent county council) the phrase must be interpreted \"in the head of the beholder\", she was doing more than pay homage to local autonomy. The government is not certain how far down the commercial road councils can go without the courts - English and European - ruling that they are acting ultra vires. Councils will be expected to see how far they can extend their frontiers into ground previously occupied by private developers. So far they have played safe by pursuing partnership arrangements. But if Michael Lyons, Birmingham's chief executive, is to be believed, when the new reforms are implemented and all the big cities have directly elected executive mayors, the major boroughs will \"score more highly as businesses than as democratic institutions\". The risk will then be that councils will become more concerned with commerce than welfare, particularly if the executive mayors have no party allegiance. It is unlikely a municipal business would accept Joe Chamberlain's aim for local government - \"equalising the condition of men and limiting the extremes which now form such a blot on our social system\". The leaders of Birmingham and Preston councils will both argue that their regeneration plans have a direct social objective. Councils still think of themselves as agencies of social welfare. But for how long? The chilling commercial language used by Kent's social services director to describe the purchase of home care - combined with the gap of \u00a3206m between what the government calculates needs to be spent on welfare and the funds it makes available - shows that the new culture will have a harder edge. Since most welfare services seem likely to be bought for private agencies, there will be very little incentive to become councillors in the hope of directly removing the \"blots for a social system\". Local government may only attract men and women with an enthusiasm for procurement and accountancy. To describe a change is not, necessarily, to condemn it. Society has moved on and local government must move with it. But the Civil Gospel, as preached by Joe Chamberlain, is dying. The hopes and ideas of men and women who wanted to clear the slums, clean the air, improve the schools and care for the sick cannot be realised by councils acting as agents for the government and employing outside contractors. It is hard to imagine a modern Joe Chamberlain believing that it is a \"sorry exchange to give up the council chamber for the cabinet\".",

Paying back loans and credit card bills is no laughing matter and nine out of ten graduates face financial difficulty according to official figures. </p> <p>A recent government survey reveals that student debt has trebled since 1995, rising from \u00a3777 a year to almost \u00a32,500 per annum. And that's not including extra bank loans, overdrafts, credit cards and store cards. </p> <p>So, if you're several thousand in the red, how exactly do you start to repay it? And is it possible to escape from debt without being reduced to a social outcast who can only afford to stay at home, existing on TV, own-brand baked beans and one bottle of Blue Nun a week? </p> <p>It's difficult, make no mistake. But you can claw your way out of debt and still have a life. Just not an extravagant one. </p> <p><strong> Step one</strong> </p> <p> Admit that you're in a bit of mess, and then figure out just how much of a mess. Collect all your financial details together. Figure out who you owe money to, how much you owe them, and how overdue any of it is. </p> <p>\"This is by far the hardest part,\" says Graham Duckett, an independent financial adviser with the Millfield Partnership. \"Most of us\", he continues, \"have a tendency to be ostriches. But if you want to regain control of your finances, you have to take your head out of the sand.\" </p> <p> <strong> Step two</strong> </p> <p> Work out your most important creditors. Sue Edwards, social policy officer at the Citizens Advice Bureau, explains who these are: \"Important creditors are the ones who can impose the harshest sanctions on you for not paying. For example, if you don't pay your mortgage or rent, you can be evicted, if you don't pay your council tax, you can be put in prison, and if you don't pay your fuel bills your supply can be cut off. Other creditors, like credit card companies, can only sue you in the county court for non-payment.\" Oh, so that's all ! </p> <p> <strong> Step three</strong> </p> <p> Make your debts easier to pay off. Try renegotiating the payment terms. This is quite possible says Gill Hankey, head of the Bankruptcy Advisory Service. </p> <p>\"If you go to them, creditors are usually quite willing to accommodate you,\" she says. \"It's in their interest to do so.\" </p> <p>Also try consolidating your debts. Instead of having several creditors to contend with, some of them applying top whack penalties, it may be more cost-efficient to take out a single loan to pay everyone else off all at once. </p> <p>And as for credit card debt, look at switching banks. Instead of paying 18 to 20% interest you could be paying nothing under an introductory offer. </p> <p>As always, shop around for the best deal and read the fine print. </p> <p> <strong> Step four</strong> </p> <p> Take stock of your outgoings. Yes, it sounds boring. Yes, it sounds time consuming. It is. But there is no way round it. \"It's just one of those things', say Adrian Moss, managing director of thedeal.net, an online finance service. \"You just can't see how to save money unless you first know where you're spending it.\" </p> <p> <strong> Step five</strong> </p> <p> Tighten your belt. But don't overdo it. It is possible to economise without causing too much discomfort, says Sophie Brooks of the National Debtline. </p> <p>She insists that you won't have to cut out all of your pleasures, but you will have to trim some of them. And you will have to keep them in trim until you've seen off your creditors.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise - so said the American philosopher, Benjamin Franklin. If this maxim held true then the growing army of workers who toil through the night would not only be poor, but ill and stupid. </p> <p>Researchers writing for the British Medical Journal put this hypotheses to the test. With tongues placed firmly in cheeks, the researchers found no evidence to suggest that night owls who go to bed after 11pm and wake up after 8am are poorer than the early birds who get up before 8am and are tucked up in bed by 11pm. </p> <p>Jesting aside, around 17% of all employees in the UK, some 4.1m people, work shifts be this evenings, nights or weekends. Some industries such as the medical profession and security work have always been associated with shift work, but the advent of 24-hour banking and shopping has led to an increase in the number of people who work shifts. </p> <p>Unfortunately, our bodies weren't designed to be awake at night and asleep during the day. So how difficult is it for shift workers to adjust to working nights? </p> <p>According to Simon Folkard, professor of psychology at the University of Wales, Swansea: \"People working shifts can make adjustments to ensure that they can cope with working nights, particularly during the early hours of the morning when people are most likely to fall asleep.\" </p> <p> He advises: \"It's important during these twilight hours at around two or three in the morning for night workers to make sure that they have enough stimulating work to do. Also simple, basic things like not being too warm or comfortable and having plenty of light all help to maintain alertness.\" </p> <p>Staying awake and alert is what night workers find most difficult. But relying on stimulants such as caffeine to keep awake is not the answer. </p> <p>\"While it's true that drinking lots of cups of coffee will keep you awake, it will also prevent you from going to sleep in the morning. The key to adjusting to night work is for people to take their time off work seriously; and make sure that they get enough sleep during the day so that they remain physically and mentally healthy,\" explains Alexander Wedderburn, a retired psychology professor. </p> <p>Fortunately for Shaun Stacey, a gas operations shift team member at Powergen, sleeping during the day when he is working night shifts is no problem. \"I'm quite lucky because I never get disturbed during the day so I always manage to get a good days sleep,\" he says. </p> <p>Shaun joined Powergen's graduate trainee scheme in September 1999 and began his current job last September. He was aware that he would have to work nights once he completed the training scheme and now works a shift system of one week of nights, a week of mornings and a week of afternoons. </p> <p>\"While I was training, I actually asked to do extra nights to prepare me and help me adjust.

      "bodyText": "Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise - so said the American philosopher, Benjamin Franklin. If this maxim held true then the growing army of workers who toil through the night would not only be poor, but ill and stupid. Researchers writing for the British Medical Journal put this hypotheses to the test. With tongues placed firmly in cheeks, the researchers found no evidence to suggest that night owls who go to bed after 11pm and wake up after 8am are poorer than the early birds who get up before 8am and are tucked up in bed by 11pm. Jesting aside, around 17% of all employees in the UK, some 4.1m people, work shifts be this evenings, nights or weekends. Some industries such as the medical profession and security work have always been associated with shift work, but the advent of 24-hour banking and shopping has led to an increase in the number of people who work shifts. Unfortunately, our bodies weren't designed to be awake at night and asleep during the day. So how difficult is it for shift workers to adjust to working nights? According to Simon Folkard, professor of psychology at the University of Wales, Swansea: \"People working shifts can make adjustments to ensure that they can cope with working nights, particularly during the early hours of the morning when people are most likely to fall asleep.\" He advises: \"It's important during these twilight hours at around two or three in the morning for night workers to make sure that they have enough stimulating work to do. Also simple, basic things like not being too warm or comfortable and having plenty of light all help to maintain alertness.\" Staying awake and alert is what night workers find most difficult. But relying on stimulants such as caffeine to keep awake is not the answer. \"While it's true that drinking lots of cups of coffee will keep you awake, it will also prevent you from going to sleep in the morning. The key to adjusting to night work is for people to take their time off work seriously; and make sure that they get enough sleep during the day so that they remain physically and mentally healthy,\" explains Alexander Wedderburn, a retired psychology professor. Fortunately for Shaun Stacey, a gas operations shift team member at Powergen, sleeping during the day when he is working night shifts is no problem. \"I'm quite lucky because I never get disturbed during the day so I always manage to get a good days sleep,\" he says. Shaun joined Powergen's graduate trainee scheme in September 1999 and began his current job last September. He was aware that he would have to work nights once he completed the training scheme and now works a shift system of one week of nights, a week of mornings and a week of afternoons. \"While I was training, I actually asked to do extra nights to prepare me and help me adjust. There are different challenges at night compared to working during the day. There are fewer people around so you have to be resourceful and be able to react and make decisions quickly,\" he says. During the night shift he has plenty of work so there is no opportunity to get bored, but he has also developed strategies to stay alert. \"I often go to the gym before a night shift because this not only gives me energy but breaks up the monotony of doing nothing but sleeping during the day and working at night.\" A short stint working nights suited Shaun Trainor, production manager at British Nuclear Fuels. \"I didn't have any problems adjusting. I have a young family and working nights meant that I could spend more time with them in the evenings before going to work.\" So, if you have to work night shifts how can you make sure that you stay awake, alert and stimulated? Don't eat big meals at night, this will only make you feel sleepy and sluggish. It's not a good idea to go out before a night shift; this will make you feel tired especially if you have had alcohol. Doing some form of exercise before your night shift will give you energy and keep you alert. Try to keep busy - saving demanding tasks for the early hours of the morning will ensure that you have to stay alert. Don't rely on stimulants to keep you awake if you're feeling sleepy. Go out for a walk and get some fresh air. Make sure that it isn't too quiet - put the radio on. If you don't remember anything else... Working nights may be against our natural rhythms but millions of people do it and manage to adjust. If you have to work nights, there are many changes you can make in your life to adapt - find out which ones work for you.",

His leadership skills are there for all to see and, soon enough, may manifest themselves in the managerial dug-out. And with Hendry, what you see is what you get. </p> <p>He cherishes every appearance, remembering his Scotland debut - against Estonia in 1993 at the comparatively late age of 27 - with vivid recollection. He counsels that the result this afternoon is more important than his personal milestone, but cannot help conceding the extra significance. \"It will be a big day, bigger than most, for me and my family. But the most important thing is the result. We are in the middle of a campaign to qualify for the World Cup.

With goals clearly in their system and Scotland performing better away from home than at the revamped Hampden, the popular suggestion that Robert Waseige's side intend to tough it out for a goalless draw seems misplaced. </p> <p>Hendry says: \"I got away with the games against Croatia and San Marino, the Latvia game as well since it was at the beginning of the season and I had just finished my pre-season training. Up to the Croatia and San Marino games I played in two or three reserve games, and the good thing was that the San Marino game came before the Croatia one. So that gave me 90 minutes. I was quite good; I wasn't 100% because I wasn't playing regular football. I don't know how I got through the Croatia game, the last 10 minutes. But the pitch was probably a bigger hindrance than my fitness.\" </p> <p>The Scotland manager Craig Brown's assessment of the player began with a statistics lesson. \"I am always accused of quoting statistics,\" he said, \"but the fact is that in 34 competitive games, with Colin playing, we have lost only 20 goals. That is some record. It is not just an opinion that Colin is a good player, the facts bear it out. Either that or the others have carried him, which I am not prepared to concede.\" Brown's assessment of Scotland's chances of qualifying in the event of defeat are naturally upbeat. \"Anything other than a win would be disappointing.

      "bodyText": "The Stockholm summit has been confronted with an unpleasant reality: the euro, centrepiece of closer economic integration, has failed to establish its credibility. The bloodbath on Wall Street and America's slide into recession should have been tailor-made for the euro to rival the dollar as the world's premier currency. Instead Europe's single currency hit a three month low against the dollar this week as dealers and investors decided that a shell-shocked US economy was a better bet than the eurozone. The latest demonstration of the euro's fragility left European leaders, not for the first time, reduced to berating the fickleness of financial markets. The mood was summed up by the economic affairs commissioner, Pedro Solbes, who claimed that foreign exchange traders were backing the wrong horse. \"Europe is the economic safe haven of the developed world at the moment and this has to be recognised by the markets,\" he said. He was backed by the commission president, Romano Prodi, who told an Italian newspaper: \"If I had money I would still bet on the euro without any difficulty.\" The euro has had a rough ride from the foreign exchange market since its launch. Its initial exchange rate against the dollar was $1.17 but America's zippier economic performance compared with that of the 12-nation eurozone - at least until late last year - saw it sink like a stone, hitting a low of little more than 82 cents. Though it subsequently recovered to 95 cents, the recent turbulence in the financial markets has seen it slump back to below 90 cents. \"There is certainly a paradox in the dollar being seen as a safe haven when it is the US stock market which has been leading the way down,\" said Ken Wattret, an economist at the French bank BNP Paribas Euro supporters can draw some comfort from the knowledge that the strength of the dollar could be a kneejerk reaction as investors favour the greenback in order to buy US government bonds - traditionally regarded as probably the world's safest investment. The market mood may be influenced, too, by a belief that America's slowdown will prove short-lived and that the recovery will be more marked on that side of the Atlantic than in Europe. But as Mr Wattret points out: \"You have the US stock market falling and very serious worries about a recession in the US, yet we still have the euro being sold against the dollar. It is a symptom of the credibility of the euro that it is still struggling.\"",

Then you have to sit back and wait for the property to be built - a process than can take up to two years with apartment blocks. </p> <p>Buying a home \"off-plan\" before the first brick has been laid is increasingly popular, say builders, who are keen to find buyers for their properties at the earliest possible stage. </p> <p>There are financial advantages for buyers from this. Committing yourself at such an early stage means you get to buy the property at the initial offer price - prices are usually lower during the first phase of the development and increase once the developer has some sales under its belt. </p> <p>Also, on some developments, early bird buyers get to choose the best plot and even dictate the position of some fittings. </p> <p>However, buying off-plan can be a risky business. If the bottom falls out of the property market, buyers may find themselves committed to purchasing a house that is worth less than they paid. </p> <p>But in the current market, according to Nicholas King, managing director of Nicholas King Homes: \"Buying off-plan enables purchasers to create their own home allowing them to choose fittings and finishes that directly appeal to their personal tastes and preferences. </p> <p>\"Provided they reserve their property at an early enough stage, changes can be incorporated into the build schedule. By giving purchasers the opportunity to buy off-plan, we give them the choice of creating a home that has its own individuality.\" </p> <p>Three of the company's homes at Curvare, a development of eight properties in the heart of the Chiltern hills, were sold off-plan to purchasers who were able to make changes to the initial design. </p> <p>\"They chose to lengthen the size of the existing wine cellar and introduce different styles of kitchen and they could, in fact, have designed the interior themselves, provided their specification remained within a pre-deter- mined budget, otherwise extra costs could be incurred,\" says Mr King. </p> <p>While Mr King says that the advantages of off-plan buying are substantial, there can be a downside as home counties resident Paul found out after purchasing a terrace town house from another developer. </p> <p>Paul is an engineer and is in the fortunate position of being able to make sense of builders' plans. Straight away he spotted a couple of drawbacks after careful inspection of the plans such as dormer windows that would eat into the roof and cut down on the amount of wardrobe space. But generally he felt he knew what to expect. </p> <p>Later on, while looking around a show home on a similar development, which he was told would have a similar layout to his own, he noticed that the design of the stairs meant he wouldn't be able to get their three-seater sofa up into the middle-floor sitting room. </p> <p>\"I was assured by the sales rep that the staircases were built to current standards and that it would be possible to get a three-seater upstairs.\" </p> <p>Reassured, he and his family awaited the completion of their new home. </p> <p>The building world is notoriously optimistic about completion dates. Yet delays are frequent. As part of the move, Paul's children were changing schools and having a firm completion date was important to the family. </p> <p>Selling, buying and moving schools can be a recipe for stress and as time went on completion dates slipped further and further back. The family was originally told they could move in late October. In the end, the house was ready at the end of January. They spent six weeks camping out with relatives in the interim. </p> <p>When moving day came they were led to believe it was little more than a case of getting the keys from the developers. As it turned out, there was a mountain of documentation to deal with. There were no lightbulbs in the house and Paul's wife had to complete the paperwork before darkness fell. \"It all had to be done in a rush. Had I known there was so much to do I would have taken the day off work and been better prepared.\" </p> <p>Once in, the family was disappointed to find the standard of finishing left a lot to be desired. \"You think when you buy a new house that there's going to be nothing to do. The house we moved from was due to have the boiler, the kitchen and other fittings replaced so we thought moving to a new home would mean we'd avoid major jobs.

Fidel Castro has ordered Cuban distilleries to begin producing rums bearing the Bacardi name for sale abroad, in retaliation for a US court decision to allow another manufacturer to market rum under one of Cuba's most famous brand names - Havana Club - for sale in the US. \"We have given instructions for our industry to start producing Bacardi, because it is ours ... and there are a lot more things we can do to respond to banditry and abuse,\" President Castro said in part of a wider speech attacking the embargo this week. \"So we will then benefit from the millions that they have spent on advertising; it is really easy to produce.\" The Havana Club brand is one of the communist state's most famous brands and is marketed internationally by the French company Pernod-Ricard, selling up to 38m bottles a year. But it cannot compete in the lucrative US market because of the US trade embargo against Cuban-made products. Its main competitor is Bacardi &amp; Co, which is owned by a Cuban exile family now based in Bermuda. Courts in the US ruled in 1999 that Bacardi could distribute rum under the Havana Club brand, because Cuba's distilleries were nationalised after Castro's 1959 revolution. Bacardi bought the rights to the trade name from its pre-nationalisation owner in 1995. Pernod-Ricard, which contested the case, has taken the issue to the World Trade Organisation, with backing from the European Union. Relations between the US and Cuba are difficult at present following the battle for custody of the Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez . President Castro's order to resume production comes as the 40th anniversary of the imposition of the embargo, after the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, approaches.",

      "body": "<p>One of the first of these Open Door columns, published in November 1997, was written in response to complaints about an article on hard-core pornography in the US which appeared in our Weekend magazine. Last week the magazine published as its cover story another piece on the same subject, this time by the novelist Martin Amis. It excited another flurry of complaints. Had nothing changed? </p> <p>Well, yes, it had. One of the main causes of complaint last time was the pictures, chosen, I was told at the time, to give some idea of the tackiness of the industry. Readers felt they more than achieved their purpose. There was particular objection to them because it was felt they exposed the subject to children in an immediate and unacceptable way, and indeed to others who did not wish to read the piece. I agreed with the objectors and said that although I thought it a perfectly legitimate subject, I felt it demanded a greater awareness and sensitivity than it received. </p> <p>No pictures were used this time, although the piece had originally been published with photographs in Talk, the American magazine, copies of which had been available in Britain (in some supermarkets, among other places). Instead, the Guardian used typographic headings through the five pages of text. The cover, similarly, was entirely taken up with the words: Amis on Porn. This form was devised, partly with the objections raised three years ago in mind, and because the editor of the magazine made it clear that she wanted the presentation to be as unsensational as possible.

      "bodyText": "One of the first of these Open Door columns, published in November 1997, was written in response to complaints about an article on hard-core pornography in the US which appeared in our Weekend magazine. Last week the magazine published as its cover story another piece on the same subject, this time by the novelist Martin Amis. It excited another flurry of complaints. Had nothing changed? Well, yes, it had. One of the main causes of complaint last time was the pictures, chosen, I was told at the time, to give some idea of the tackiness of the industry. Readers felt they more than achieved their purpose. There was particular objection to them because it was felt they exposed the subject to children in an immediate and unacceptable way, and indeed to others who did not wish to read the piece. I agreed with the objectors and said that although I thought it a perfectly legitimate subject, I felt it demanded a greater awareness and sensitivity than it received. No pictures were used this time, although the piece had originally been published with photographs in Talk, the American magazine, copies of which had been available in Britain (in some supermarkets, among other places). Instead, the Guardian used typographic headings through the five pages of text. The cover, similarly, was entirely taken up with the words: Amis on Porn. This form was devised, partly with the objections raised three years ago in mind, and because the editor of the magazine made it clear that she wanted the presentation to be as unsensational as possible. Her misgivings, which were still unresolved when the editor of the paper took the final decision to publish, were shared by some of her colleagues: I will come to some of their views in a moment. Some of the readers who objected to the piece felt that the plain statement of the cover was insufficient indication of the uncompromisingly explicit nature of the content, and that additional warning should have been given. Amis, indeed, spared his readers little. He spoke to the performers and producers of hard-core pornography, described or allowed them to describe the practices which define hard-core pornography in a way in which they had never before been described in the Guardian and, in my view, he demonstrated how degrading and destructive it all is. The person who bought the piece for the Guardian (not the editor of Weekend), although she foresaw objections, felt that Amis's tone was \"one of shock and incredulity at a multi-million dollar, multi-national industry based on systematic abuse and degradation\". She added: \"This is a world-class writer addressing a subject which is both pervasive and taboo, and which has always presented a particular dilemma to the libertarian left.\" I have read all the letters to the Guardian about this article: 20 strongly objecting, 10 applauding it or simply making interested comment.

The sanction seemed far too mild. If Eriksson manages to get England through their remaining Group Nine games and into the World Cup finals, Century-FM should have its nationality revoked. </p> <p>There was, in fact, a more serious side to the affair. With some reluctance, Eriksson mentioned that his habit of telephoning the club managers of his players had been disrupted by the first incident. Several of them are now in the habit of asking for his number and ringing him back, as a safeguard against another hoax. \"That's happened a few times, and it's not nice,\" he said. \"Maybe we'll have to think of a code word.\" </p> <p>His day was also punctuated by another unexpected incident, when he was presented with a set of golf clubs in a bag bearing his name in large letters and invited, for the benefit of photographers, to play a shot near the 10th green of the Carden Park Hotel course, where the squad are staying. He is not, he confessed, much of a golfer. \"I have the maximum handicap,\" he said. Nevertheless he obliged the snappers - and the England sponsors, who had provided the bag and whose name was prominently displayed in the vicinity. Given his salary of \u00a32m a year, Eriksson probably has little choice, although he must sometimes wonder what kind of people he has come to live among. </p> <p>He gave a rare clue to his methods yesterday when he indicated that his last pre-match team talk will be given at half past noon, before the squad leave the hotel for the coach journey to Anfield. \"Some coaches like to give the last talk in the dressing room,\" he said. \"I prefer earlier, so that when we get to the stadium they can concentrate on their boots, their equipment, and so on. It's a very individual thing. If there are 18 players, there are perhaps 18 different ways of concentrating. I think that's very important.\" </p> <p>Of the limited amount of information on Eriksson's methods that has emerged from inside the squad, quite the most interesting is the outline of his last talk to the players before the Spain match, as described by Chris Powell, his surprise choice at left-back, to the Sunday Times. \"Everybody was at ease with what he was trying to put over,\" Powell said. \"He told us that the staff were there to help us, that we were there to help each other, and that we were all there to make the nation proud. It was a simple message, but it stuck in my mind, and I know from talking to them that it stuck in the minds of everyone present.\" </p> <p>A simple message, yes, but the simplicity of a man who understands that footballers do not need to be burdened with an excess of information in the minutes before a match, and that if tubs need to be thumped and flags waved, there is probably something wrong with the players' inherent quality or their preparation. </p> <p>As for his own attitude, he seems to be finding exactly the right combination of commitment and detachment. Had he ever been, someone asked yesterday, in a win-or-bust position before? \"Many times.\" But surely this would be the most important match of his career? \"With no competition at all.\" </p> <p>Even at Benfica, he said, only 120,000 people were concerned about the result. \"But tomorrow 120,000 will be nothing. Nothing at all. Tomorrow there will be 50 or 60m. Well, maybe not all of them will be watching the match. But I've never had so many supporters before. In that way alone it will certainly be the most important match I've ever faced.\" </p> <p>And, he promises, not the easy one that some expect. Nevertheless he expects to face the day refreshed by a decent night's rest. \"I'm not suffering because I'm too nervous,\" he concluded. \"I will sleep well.\"</p>",

It could be eight if, against expectations, Eriksson prefers to play Phil Neville at right-back instead of his brother Gary. If the predictions are correct, however, Gary Neville will join Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and Powell in the back four with Gerrard and Paul Scholes in midfield flanked by David Beckham and McManaman. </p> <p>Andy Cole will lead the attack with Michael Owen dropping off, a combination that showed promise against Spain.

Gerrard and Scholes will be important both in linking defence to attack and preventing Litmanen in particular from getting behind them. </p> <p>\"I never mark man-for-man,\" Eriksson explained yesterday, \"but we must try not to give Litmanen too much space. Then he can be a danger. Finland are a very organised team with two quick players up front and central defenders who are good in the air. We must not allow ourselves to become stretched. You cannot play good football when that happens.\" </p> <p>Cole and Owen are entitled to demand a solid platform from which they can take on defenders who know all too well what to expect. At the same time Eriksson is entitled to expect Cole to hit the target at least when the opportunity arises. With both Cole and Owen in form for their clubs it is hard to believe that one or the other, or even both, will not score today. </p> <p>In any case, Scholes's penchant for getting beyond the front runners to find the net is always a useful alternative. </p> <p>Eriksson's appointment continues to have its critics. The strident cries of England for the English will not easily be silenced. All that this quietly knowledgeable Swede can do is win matches and give the nation's football followers something better to look forward to than a spot of flagwaving followed by inevitable failure amid water-cannon accompaniment. </p> <p>The Football Association believes, reasonably enough, that England cannot seriously consider winning another World Cup until the 2006 tournament in Germany. But for that to happen it is essential that the present crop of players, plus any budding talents waiting in the wings, get tournament experience.

You cannot play good football when that happens.\" Cole and Owen are entitled to demand a solid platform from which they can take on defenders who know all too well what to expect. At the same time Eriksson is entitled to expect Cole to hit the target at least when the opportunity arises. With both Cole and Owen in form for their clubs it is hard to believe that one or the other, or even both, will not score today. In any case, Scholes's penchant for getting beyond the front runners to find the net is always a useful alternative. Eriksson's appointment continues to have its critics. The strident cries of England for the English will not easily be silenced. All that this quietly knowledgeable Swede can do is win matches and give the nation's football followers something better to look forward to than a spot of flagwaving followed by inevitable failure amid water-cannon accompaniment. The Football Association believes, reasonably enough, that England cannot seriously consider winning another World Cup until the 2006 tournament in Germany. But for that to happen it is essential that the present crop of players, plus any budding talents waiting in the wings, get tournament experience. Which is why England cannot afford to drop more points at home now. \u0095 Fifa ruled yesterday that England's World Cup qualifier in Albania on Wednesday will go ahead. Violence in neighbouring Macedonia had left the match in doubt.",

      "body": "<p>Andy Cole was at it again this week, scowling at the world and pouring scorn on those who had doubted him, thwarted him, and generally hindered his development into the top-class international forward he has always believed himself to be. The temptation to yawn was almost overwhelming. But whereas sometimes a player lets rip in order to get himself noticed, or to earn a few grand from a red-top tabloid, at least Cole's motives seemed relatively unsullied by arrogance or avarice. </p> <p>Probably all he wanted to say was that the new England coach seems like a decent chap who is willing to give him a fair shake. But he was unable to say it without making the comparison between Sven-Goran Eriksson and his predecessors, who - in Cole's version - wantonly inflicted varying degrees of damage on the Manchester United striker's international career. So far that career is mainly celebrated for yielding no goals in 11 appearances stretching back six years, a time during which he has scored 115 goals for Manchester United at an average of just under one every two matches. In expressing his pleasure in being granted, at last, a decent run in the national side, he chose to preface the award of his 12th cap, which seems certain to come against Finland today, by aiming another stream of bile out of the rear window. </p> <p>\"It's the first time I've had this backing at international level,\" he said. \"Other England managers have talked rubbish. They're entitled to their opinion, but it means nothing to me. I always knew I could cut it at international level.\" </p> <p>If there is some justice in what he says, it hardly needed saying. Above all, now is not the time to say it. After being treated with caution by Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan, his chance is here at last, thanks to Eriksson, who said after the match against Spain three weeks ago: \"Andy Cole is a great international football player.\" Having evidently convinced the man who matters, all Cole needs to do is demonstrate the truth of the assertion to the rest of us. </p> <p>A convincing performance this afternoon will undoubtedly lead to a 13th cap in Albania on Wednesday. And success in Tirana will set him up for a crescendo that should reach its climax at the World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea in the summer of 2002, when he will be 30 years old and facing his last chance to make a significant impact at the very highest level. He should be looking ahead, not giving the impression that he still broods on the slights administered in the past. </p> <p>But, as in the case of Linford Christie, society's pliers have bent what should have been a useful pride and self-belief into a surliness that seems particularly unattractive in a man so successful within a world so appealing that most of us use it as a source of dream-fulfilment. We expect top athletes to show some gratitude for their good fortune, and find it hard to make allowances when the occasional Cole or Christie refuses to let go of the suspicion and resentment that influenced their earlier existences. Someone who worked with Cole at Manchester United, for example, remembers that immediately after his much-publicised arrival at Old Trafford, their first conversation was conducted without a single meeting of the eyes. \"Not only did he refuse to look at me,\" the man said this week, \"he never ever turned his head towards me.\" </p> <p>In his autobiography, published two years ago in the wake of Manchester United's treble season, Cole is utterly frank about the problems he created for himself as a child and an adolescent in Nottingham, where his father found work as a coal miner after arriving from Jamaica in the 1960s. The family was large and loving, but Lincoln Cole's belief in adherence to traditional values and modes of behaviour was always likely to be undermined both by the immediate environment and by young Andy's rebellious instincts. \"Disruptive, argumentative and uncooperative\" are the words Cole applies to his younger self. \"I was downright belligerent and plain rude,\" he writes. \"When I look back, I cringe. You are supposed to grow out of that sort of wild-boy act very quickly. I didn't. Football and anarchy were my favourite games.\" </p> <p><strong> Record of turbulence</strong><br> </p> <p> Such a self-assessment might be suspected of over-dramatisation were it not for the validation provided by Cole's record of turbulence. He was a mere 12 years old when, by his own account, he walked out of Nottingham Forest when a senior player made a racist joke. He was a junior pro at Arsenal when he fell out with George Graham, who was probably not thrilled by the court appearance that followed a weekend spent at home in Nottingham, although Cole was subsequently acquitted of a GBH charge. During three years as a member of the Arsenal first-team squad, he was restricted by Graham to only one brief appearance as a sub. </p> <p>In between the episodes at the City Ground and Highbury, Cole enjoyed what seems to have been his first positive experience in elite football when he spent two years at Lilleshall, the Football Association's now-defunct boarding school for the country's most promising youngsters. \"The whole experience was invaluable,\" he reflected later. \"You had to forget any notion that you were owed an easy living. It was a case of buckling down and taking the discipline. If I had retained my earlier independent, even insolent attitude, I couldn't have survived.\" </p> <p>By this time next week it may seem particularly significant that his mentor at Lilleshall was Dave Sexton, the much-loved veteran whom he describes as \"one of the best coaches I have ever worked under\". Sexton joined the senior England camp this week, and was immediately listed in the official personnel roll beneath Eriksson and Tord Grip but ahead of Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren. After being, in his view, so comprehensively misunderstood at senior England level, Cole may feel doubly reassured by the presence of Sexton alongside McClaren, his current coach at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Cole's scoring record with his club is impeccable, but so is that of Kevin Phillips at Sunderland. Eriksson is banking on the Manchester United man's ability to produce the extra touch of class that defines a true international. Unlike Phillips, after all, he has scored goals against Barcelona, Juventus, Fiorentina, Marseille, Valencia and Sturm Graz in the six years since he moved to Old Trafford, plus hat-tricks against Feyenoord in 1997 and Anderlecht last September. It might be pointed out by sceptics, however, that he has scored in only two of the eight Champions League matches in which he has played this season. </p> <p>His inability to register his first international goal is only one of the mysteries that tend to hang around Andy Cole. Why did Venables find it necessary to pretend, in 1994, that the forward was injured when he left him out of an England squad? Cole, to his credit, blew protocol apart by publicly exposing that apparently convenient fiction. Why did Keegan show such curious alacrity in accepting Ferguson's offer of \u00a36m for a man who had scored 55 goals in 69 games for a Newcastle United side on its way back to the top? Why did Hoddle choose to remark so cruelly that Cole required five or six chances to score a goal? Why did he announce last year that he wished henceforth to be known as Andrew Cole? (The answer to that, it is said, is due less to a sudden access of late-blooming gravitas than to a sudden discovery that the website andycole.com had already been registered.) </p> <p>At 29, with a long-term partner and a growing son, he is no longer the \"plain and simple tearaway\" whose unattractive exploits he ruefully chronicled in his autobiography. The first sign may have been the way he grew into his United shirt after the retirement of Eric Cantona, whose headmasterly glares had held his early errors up to harsh exposure. The second may have been the maturity with which he appeared to ease naturally out of his initially close friendship with his fellow striker Dwight Yorke, an unreconstructed party animal. The next sign - but don't hold your breath - might be a rebuilding of bridges with Teddy Sheringham, the United and England colleague to whom he has not spoken off the pitch since an argument two years ago, apparently concerning Cole's alleged reluctance to do his share of the defensive chores. </p> <p>Now he faces, in quick succession, two chances to establish himself as England's first-choice strike forward, alongside a younger man, Michael Owen, with whom he may yet establish a fruitful partnership. Neither has the world's sweetest first touch. But both have speed across the ground, quick feet, a willingness to improvise, and the sort of football brain that is visible in the angles of the darting runs they make when the ball is elsewhere. And, finally, the urgent, unshakeable belief that this is where they truly belong.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Macedonia is on a knife edge, with its coalition government facing the dilemma of trying to offer concessions to ethnic Albanians without provoking the Slav majority, Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general said last night. However, progress was being made in areas bordering Serbia and Kosovo, he said. This included the promise of peace talks this weekend between Serbia and ethnic Albanian leaders fighting in the Presevo valley - an area bordering Kosovo, southern Serbia, and Macedonia. Lord Robertson also said an agreement had been reached with Nato-led K-For peacekeepers which would allow lightly-armed Serb forces to enter two buffer zones along the northern and western border with Kosovo. It was essential, he said, to \"marginalise\" ethnic Albanian extremists whose objective - as it had been previously in Kosovo and southern Serbia - was to provoke a disproportionate reaction that would drag in outside forces. Nato, the UN, and the EU are all pressing the Macedonians to reach a political solution, including a higher status for the Albanian language, more Albanians in public administration and more money for the Albanian university in Tetovo, Macedonia's second city. Lord Robertson said the UN had estimated that 18,000 ethnic Albanians had left their homes in Macedonia, 11,000 of them displaced inside the country. At a London briefing, he conceded that some Nato governments were reluctant to move more of their troops to Kosovo's border with Macedonia. Though he did not name the countries concerned, they are believed to include the US. Asked if K-For troops could not have done more to police the border, he replied: \"It is very, very difficult territory\". However, the Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, made his view quite plain yesterday. \"We think they [K-For] have to improve their presence on the border,\" he said in Stockholm where he is attending the EU summit. Lord Robertson said he was optimistic that Nato countries would send extra troops to Kosovo, although he has scaled down his request from an extra 1,400 soldiers to what he called yesterday \"six companies \" - about 600 troops. Germany yesterday announced plans to send around 130 extra soldiers from its artillery battery in Kosovo to Skopje on Sunday to reinforce German K-For patrols on the border. The defence ministry spokesman, Detlef Puhl, said the new troops would take charge of four self-propelled guns which would be brought out of reserve. A company of 100 to 150 men which had been due to be withdrawn from the area would also be kept in place. EU leaders welcomed Mr Trajkovski yesterday to support him in his conflict with ethnic Albanian rebels and push him toward reforms that ease tense ethnic tensions. The leaders heard a report from Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy supremo, its external affairs commissioner Chris Patten, and Anna Lindh, the Swedish foreign minister, who have all visited Skopje in the last few days to discuss ways in which the violence could be contained. Mr Trajkovski was urged to meet demands for a greater role in Macedonian society for the ethnic Albanians and call on Albanians in neighbouring countries - especially in Kosovo - to distance themselves from the fighting. EU leaders have a significant carrot to offer: next month the union is to sign a \"stabilisation and association agreement\" with Macedonia that requires it to work for peaceful resolution of its internal conflicts. The Macedonian leader was told of Brussels' backing for his country's territorial integrity and Nato's pledge to step up efforts to prevent guerrilla infiltration across the Kosovo-Macedonia border.

      "bodyText": "The Duke of Westminster has taken drastic measures to protect his prize herd of bulls during the foot-and-mouth crisis, it emerged yesterday. The 140 Holstein bulls are being kept inside a specially sealed barn along with a vet and studman on the duke's Grosvenor estate in Chester. Filtered oxygen is being pumped into the tents where both the men and the bulls are expected to remain until Cheshire is given the all-clear by ministry officials. It is hoped the cattle would escape slaughter even if foot-and-mouth were confirmed within the government-imposed exclusion zone. It is understood the measures were introduced a week ago by breeding company Cogent to protect the bulls, which produce high-quality semen in demand by exporters. Managing director Tim Heywood said: \"We normally have 28 people in the area looking after the bulls but we were forced to take these extraordinary measures to make sure our prize herd remains free of any chance of infection from foot-and-mouth. \"No exterior air is allowed to enter, except that pumped in through special Ministry of Agriculture-approved filters. For the past week, our company vet and our studman have been locked in with the bulls. We deliver groceries to them and even the odd beer to help them feel more comfortable.\" So far just two cases of foot-and-mouth have been confirmed in Cheshire - both on farms at Baddiley, near Nantwich.

      "body": "<p>When the killing has to start, Gordon Rae will lure his sheep to slaughter with their last bag of feed.</p> <p>It is the only way. The maternal instinct is so strong in his 650 ewes, newly lambed, that they would attack his dogs if he tried to round them up.</p> <p>The thought of what will follow haunts him. \"You are immediately given a choice: muck in and keep busy or disappear until they have finished,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I think I will be needed. The sheep will come to a bag of feed and the lambs will follow. It's dreadful to think you are rounding them up with feed to lead them into this situation.</p> <p>\"I imagine it will be a captive-bolt gun for the ewes and I have heard they use lethal injection for the lambs. There will be no order. I don't imagine they will take a ewe with its lamb by its side.</p> <p>\"There will just be a big pen and there will be enormous distress among the animals. You only need to try and move 10 sheep out of the shed and they are spinning around in panic looking for their lambs.</p> <p>\"I go out on the field now and I feed them and the lambs are leaping around and the fields are peaceful, and you can't comprehend that they are going to turn into fields of fire.\"</p> <p>The Raes have farmed here at Muirhead, on the edge of Lockerbie, for more than 50 years - first Gordon's father, Hastings, and now Gordon himself.</p> <p>The pink-washed farm sits on a small rise to the west of the town. In better days the views will be stunning. In these altered times the scene is marred by smoke from giant pyres, like preparations for some monstrous feast the Raes are compelled to join.</p> <p>Muirhead is clean but the infection is all around and so its flock must die. They are waiting for the call.</p> <p>It has been a thriving business. Each year they produce around 1,100 lambs for market and they have a second farm where they winter cattle for other farmers, and a sheep-shearing business that serves the county.</p> <p>Gordon, 38, knows that livestock farming can be a brutal affair. \"Normally we look to sell the lambs at about 16 weeks old in May and June. The ewes are not feeding them by that time but it is the same as humans - the bond is still there. It is an unfortunate thing, but we are in business and that is the way the system works. The bond has to be broken.\"</p> <p>But this feels different; this feels wrong. Most of the lambs, around 800, are already here. Most are only days old.</p> <p>\"I'm fairly hardened to a lot of things but it will be very difficult,\" he said. \"I don't know how to accept it. I don't know if my father will be able to take any part in it.\"</p> <p>The children know. At eight, Jennifer has taken it on board. George, five, has a fair idea. Two-year-old Calum tells visitors: \"Baa's dead.\"</p> <p>\"They all have pet sheep,\" said Gordon. \"They've asked me if we could use one of the sheds to hide their own sheep, until the men have gone.\"</p> <p>Life has taken on a grotesque routine. Gordon has had to lamb the young ewes with a towel around his head, so thick was the smoke from a neighbour's pyre. He sleeps no more than four or five hours a night and spends his days checking for lesions and lameness. They have already had one scare.</p> <p>The feed is running out, but the feed company will not deliver more; it says it is pointless. \"But it's not bred in you to just neglect them,\" said Gordon. \"It's not the fault of the sheep. You keep looking after them.\"</p> <p>His face is a study in fatigue and frustration. He has stopped watching the news. He does not think Tony Blair or any of the others have truly understood what this crisis means. He has started to feel that the world is tumbling in.</p> <p>\"I really don't think people have a clue. I was speaking to one of our local auctioneers the other day and he said, 'Give me the top brass for a day and I will put them back in their cars in tears'. We have farms here where the hardest men are on their hands and knees. They are chasing the disease but it is running away from them.\"</p> <p>He wonders if politicians know the most basic things; that wiping out the hill stock will throw everything off kilter for years. \"If you cull them all and put new stock on, they will be totally lost. They will get killed in the snow, they will disappear. That's an enormous problem facing the industry.\"</p> <p>He cannot even think about the financial side. He will have to sign a valuation minutes before the flock is slaughtered and has heard the going rate is \u00a390 per ewe. That is not enough. His flock is young and robust - prime stock.

      "bodyText": "When the killing has to start, Gordon Rae will lure his sheep to slaughter with their last bag of feed. It is the only way. The maternal instinct is so strong in his 650 ewes, newly lambed, that they would attack his dogs if he tried to round them up. The thought of what will follow haunts him. \"You are immediately given a choice: muck in and keep busy or disappear until they have finished,\" he said. \"I think I will be needed. The sheep will come to a bag of feed and the lambs will follow. It's dreadful to think you are rounding them up with feed to lead them into this situation. \"I imagine it will be a captive-bolt gun for the ewes and I have heard they use lethal injection for the lambs. There will be no order. I don't imagine they will take a ewe with its lamb by its side. \"There will just be a big pen and there will be enormous distress among the animals. You only need to try and move 10 sheep out of the shed and they are spinning around in panic looking for their lambs. \"I go out on the field now and I feed them and the lambs are leaping around and the fields are peaceful, and you can't comprehend that they are going to turn into fields of fire.\" The Raes have farmed here at Muirhead, on the edge of Lockerbie, for more than 50 years - first Gordon's father, Hastings, and now Gordon himself. The pink-washed farm sits on a small rise to the west of the town. In better days the views will be stunning. In these altered times the scene is marred by smoke from giant pyres, like preparations for some monstrous feast the Raes are compelled to join. Muirhead is clean but the infection is all around and so its flock must die. They are waiting for the call. It has been a thriving business. Each year they produce around 1,100 lambs for market and they have a second farm where they winter cattle for other farmers, and a sheep-shearing business that serves the county. Gordon, 38, knows that livestock farming can be a brutal affair. \"Normally we look to sell the lambs at about 16 weeks old in May and June. The ewes are not feeding them by that time but it is the same as humans - the bond is still there. It is an unfortunate thing, but we are in business and that is the way the system works. The bond has to be broken.\" But this feels different; this feels wrong. Most of the lambs, around 800, are already here. Most are only days old. \"I'm fairly hardened to a lot of things but it will be very difficult,\" he said. \"I don't know how to accept it. I don't know if my father will be able to take any part in it.\" The children know. At eight, Jennifer has taken it on board. George, five, has a fair idea. Two-year-old Calum tells visitors: \"Baa's dead.\" \"They all have pet sheep,\" said Gordon. \"They've asked me if we could use one of the sheds to hide their own sheep, until the men have gone.\" Life has taken on a grotesque routine. Gordon has had to lamb the young ewes with a towel around his head, so thick was the smoke from a neighbour's pyre. He sleeps no more than four or five hours a night and spends his days checking for lesions and lameness. They have already had one scare. The feed is running out, but the feed company will not deliver more; it says it is pointless. \"But it's not bred in you to just neglect them,\" said Gordon. \"It's not the fault of the sheep. You keep looking after them.\" His face is a study in fatigue and frustration. He has stopped watching the news. He does not think Tony Blair or any of the others have truly understood what this crisis means. He has started to feel that the world is tumbling in. \"I really don't think people have a clue. I was speaking to one of our local auctioneers the other day and he said, 'Give me the top brass for a day and I will put them back in their cars in tears'. We have farms here where the hardest men are on their hands and knees. They are chasing the disease but it is running away from them.\" He wonders if politicians know the most basic things; that wiping out the hill stock will throw everything off kilter for years. \"If you cull them all and put new stock on, they will be totally lost. They will get killed in the snow, they will disappear. That's an enormous problem facing the industry.\" He cannot even think about the financial side. He will have to sign a valuation minutes before the flock is slaughtered and has heard the going rate is \u00a390 per ewe. That is not enough. His flock is young and robust - prime stock. He wonders what they will do with empty fields in a silent spring. It could be late summer before he can restock. It could be as long as a year. He worries, too, about his dad. \"My father has been here all his life. In 1952 there was an outbreak and this farm was one of only three that escaped it. He's a man of few words, but he said the other day that he wondered if we could ever escape it this time.\" Outside, Hastings Rae, 66, is looking to the horizon. \"We just live day to day,\" he said. \"We have no idea what is coming.\" Then he smiled gently. \"Let's talk of something else,\" he said, and the subject changed to the comforting banalities of a normal life.

Kremlin officials, however, warned that more \"painful\" reprisals were imminent. The four diplomats, accused of \"activities incompatible with their status\" - a diplomatic euphemism for spying - were told that they must leave Moscow in the next few days. The foreign ministry said the US could expect further measures aimed at stopping \"illegal activities of official US representatives in Russia\". What form these measures might take was not clear, but the foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, previously had said that the expulsions from Moscow would mirror the number of Russian diplomats ordered out of the US. \"However many are expelled from the US will be expelled from Russia,\" a senior aide to the president, Vladimir Putin, said. As the worst spy row since the end of the cold war intensified, the US ambassador to the Russian federation, James Collins, chose to retreat from the capital for a 10-day railway tour of southern Siberia, visiting regional public libraries. His deputy, John Ordway, was summoned instead to the foreign ministry to receive details of the initial expulsions. Undisclosed security sources said that they had already drawn up a list of other US officials who were spying under cover of diplomatic immunity. Mr Putin, who was in Stockholm yesterday to meet European heads of state during an EU economic summit, played down the developing crisis in Russian-American relations, responding curtly to reporters' questions. \"I have no particular opinion about that,\" he said of the spy row. Asked if he thought it would seriously strain relations between the two countries, he replied: \"I do not think so.\" The tit-for-tat expulsions were triggered by the arrest of senior FBI official Robert Hanssen, charged with passing secrets to Moscow for the past 15 years. The US president, George Bush, announced his decision to banish four Russian diplomats on Thursday; another 46 Russians have until July 1 to leave the country. Senior figures within the Kremlin did not share the president's relaxed attitude, however. The head of the security council, for instance, reacted angrily to the expulsions. Sergei Ivanov, in the US for bridge-building meetings last week, added that the move marked the end of cooperation between the two countries on problems such as international terrorism or drug smuggling. Dismissing American suggestions that the incident would not affect bilateral ties, he accused George Bush's administration of adopting \"cold-war stereotypes\". \"The current spy scandal is a clear political step aimed primarily at showing off the new administration's strong muscles, and at demonstrating what tough guys have arrived in power in the USA,\" he said during a visit to Poland. \"We can easily find a response that is more painful to the United States,\" he warned. \"We have time to think, to carefully pick from among more than 1,000 US diplomats in Russia, to choose those who are most precious to the Americans.\" The former prime minister and KGB head, Yevgeny Primakov, also reacted irritably. \"They think that they can treat us like some sort of Latin American country - not just any Latin American, but as a banana republic,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>European Union leaders were struggling last night to make progress on liberalising their economies in the face of disagreements about pace, a weak euro and diversions over foot and mouth disease and Macedonia.</p> <p>Tony Blair and fellow summiteers were able to declare one Stockholm success by agreeing a reform of financial services which will make access to capital easier in the EU's single market and offer wider consumer choice.</p> <p>But they admitted to differences over other targets set at last year's Lisbon summit. And President Jacques Chirac of France complained that precious time was being used up in talks about the Balkans and Russia.</p> <p>Despite continuing worries about the stock markets and the poor performance of the single currency, there was agreement that, although the economic fundamentals of euroland were strong, much modernisation was needed to allow it to better compete with the US.</p> <p>Pedro Solbes, the EU's economic affairs commissioner, argued that relatively strong growth in Europe made it \"a safe haven\" for investors.</p> <p>Yet there was no hope of reaching agreement by the summit's end this afternoon on liberalising the electricity and gas sectors - a key Lisbon demand - or of opening up postal services to EU-wide competition.</p> <p>Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, predicted there would be no action from France before the 2002 elections. Laurent Fabius, his French colleague, said he did not want to see \"deregulation for deregulation's sake\" but wanted to ensure that any liberalisation would not come at the expense of the cost or quality of services to consumers.</p> <p>European commission proposals for a \"single European sky\" to ease air traffic congestion - held up by an Anglo-Spanish row over Gibraltar - and for a European patent, also appeared to be in trouble.</p> <p>Romano Prodi, president of the commission, began the day by saying that eurozone policy would be easier to coordinate if the 12 members of the single currency appointed a \"Mr Euro\" to represent them - an idea strongly opposed by the European Central Bank.</p> <p>Mr Prodi made waves even before the summit began by suggesting that Sweden, its host, would find life easier if it joined the eurozone. Like Mr Blair, prime minister Goran Persson faces a tough decision on whether and when to call a referendum.</p> <p>It was at last year's Lisbon \"dot.com\" summit that the EU pledged to create 20m new jobs by 2010 and make the union \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world\".</p> <p>Stockholm's main purpose is to assess how far the Lisbon targets have been met and how Europe is faring in adapting to the digital age and putting new technologies to profitable use.

      "bodyText": "European Union leaders were struggling last night to make progress on liberalising their economies in the face of disagreements about pace, a weak euro and diversions over foot and mouth disease and Macedonia. Tony Blair and fellow summiteers were able to declare one Stockholm success by agreeing a reform of financial services which will make access to capital easier in the EU's single market and offer wider consumer choice. But they admitted to differences over other targets set at last year's Lisbon summit. And President Jacques Chirac of France complained that precious time was being used up in talks about the Balkans and Russia. Despite continuing worries about the stock markets and the poor performance of the single currency, there was agreement that, although the economic fundamentals of euroland were strong, much modernisation was needed to allow it to better compete with the US. Pedro Solbes, the EU's economic affairs commissioner, argued that relatively strong growth in Europe made it \"a safe haven\" for investors. Yet there was no hope of reaching agreement by the summit's end this afternoon on liberalising the electricity and gas sectors - a key Lisbon demand - or of opening up postal services to EU-wide competition. Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, predicted there would be no action from France before the 2002 elections. Laurent Fabius, his French colleague, said he did not want to see \"deregulation for deregulation's sake\" but wanted to ensure that any liberalisation would not come at the expense of the cost or quality of services to consumers. European commission proposals for a \"single European sky\" to ease air traffic congestion - held up by an Anglo-Spanish row over Gibraltar - and for a European patent, also appeared to be in trouble. Romano Prodi, president of the commission, began the day by saying that eurozone policy would be easier to coordinate if the 12 members of the single currency appointed a \"Mr Euro\" to represent them - an idea strongly opposed by the European Central Bank. Mr Prodi made waves even before the summit began by suggesting that Sweden, its host, would find life easier if it joined the eurozone. Like Mr Blair, prime minister Goran Persson faces a tough decision on whether and when to call a referendum. It was at last year's Lisbon \"dot.com\" summit that the EU pledged to create 20m new jobs by 2010 and make the union \"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world\". Stockholm's main purpose is to assess how far the Lisbon targets have been met and how Europe is faring in adapting to the digital age and putting new technologies to profitable use. It will also review progress on pushing ahead for fuller employment. Thursday's complex eve of summit deal on financial services, pushed by Britain's chancellor, Gordon Brown, was always likely to be the easiest item to resolve, despite objections by Germany. \"It ensures that European industry and commerce as a whole have easier access to cheaper capital for innovation and the creation of jobs,\" said the internal market commissioner, Frits Bolkestein. But Mr Bolkestein, an influential thinker, was sharply critical of the lack of progress elsewhere. \"We continue to hark back to what was discussed at Lisbon but we should be anything but complacent on the progress that has been achieved,\" he said. \"Progress is spotty and that gives cause for concern. Brave words were spoken on liberalisation. They have not been followed up to a sufficient extent.\" Brussels wants to push governments to go further, acknowledging that it is its historic role - however thankless - to set the pace. Mr Prodi's spokesman, Jonathan Faull, warned on Thursday that the summit was the \"moment of truth\" for EU leaders. Yesterday he denied that he was making any link to the troubles of the euro. But leaders are aware that progress towards streamlining the economy could help prop up the ailing currency during a slump in financial markets. Governments sought to put a more positive spin on the likely summit outcome today. \"This is a 10-year plan and this is year one,\" said one senior British official. \"You are talking about 15 member states and you need to gear people up politically.\"",

      "bodyText": "A Dutch lorry driver, accused of the manslaughter of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants found dead in the back of a truck at Dover, yesterday told a court he could not explain how their only air supply was cut off. Sixty Chinese people tried to illegally enter Britain hidden in the back of a sealed lorry container laden with tomatoes on June 18 last year. Port officials discovered the bodies of 54 men and four women after inspecting the lorry on its arrival at Dover's eastern docks in Kent. They also found two men who had survived. Perry Wacker, 33, is accused of \"sealing the fate\" of the Chinese by closing the only air vent on the side of the container so as to avoid detection by immigration officials. Wacker, of Rotterdam, is charged with 58 counts of manslaughter and four counts of conspiracy to smuggle people into Britain. Maidstone crown court in Kent had earlier heard that the air vent being closed for the six hours it took the lorry to get from Zeebrugge in Belgium to Dover had caused them to suffocate. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, said the air vent was tied open with a piece of string when Wacker started his journey in Rotterdam. He said: \"You used it to tie the vent back before starting off?\" Wacker replied: \"I did not use any string.\" The court heard that a ball of string was found inside the cab of the lorry. Mr Temple said the lorry stopped at a petrol station shortly before reaching Zeebrugge at 5.50pm, which was when the vent must have been closed. The court heard that Wacker said he was delivering a load of tomatoes to an address in Bristol, but the location did not exist. Ying Guo, 30, of South Woodford, Essex, is jointly charged with Wacker on another count of conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into this country. Both accused deny all charges. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "A Bosnian Serb sought by the UN war crimes tribunal for the alleged torture and death of Muslims during the Bosnian war was arrested and handed over to the court in the Hague yesterday; the first suspect to be surrendered by Yugoslav authorities. A tribunal spokesman identified the suspect as Milomir Stakic, the former mayor of Prijedor, and said he was wanted for atrocities allegedly committed between April 1992 and January 1993 at several detention camps set up in Bosnia for Muslims during the war. \"He's alleged to have planned, organised and implemented the creation of a number of detention facilities or camps, including Omarska, Keraterm and Trnopolje camps,\" the spokesman, Jim Landale, said. \"As far as the court is concerned this is a concrete sign of cooperation from the authorities in Belgrade and we hope it is the start of a process which will see the transfer of all fugitives residing on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\" The transfer of the suspect comes just days after a delegation of Belgrade officials visited the Hague to discuss cooperation with the court. A 1997 report on the Omarska camp, which was compiled by Human Rights Watch, cites Mr Stakic as saying that any deaths at Omarska were few and \"were natural deaths, with medical documentation of death, but not from murder\". Yugoslavia has been under heavy pressure to cooperate with the tribunal, and the government in Belgrade had been given a March 31 deadline for improving its record of dealing with war crimes suspects, or the United States would cut off aid. Washington is primarily interested in the arrest and extradition of the former Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, sought by the tribunal for alleged atrocities in Kosovo. While the new Yugoslav authorities say they want Mr Milosevic to stand trial in Belgrade, their decision to hand over Mr Stakic showed that they appear willing to extradite more minor suspects in an attempt to appease the US and its allies. Zoran Djindjic, the prime minister of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic, travelled to Washington this week in an effort to persuade the US administration to give his government more time to deal with key American demands. On Thursday, justice officials in Belgrade urged war crimes suspects living in the country to surrender voluntarily to the tribunal. There are about 15 war crimes suspects thought to be living in Yugoslavia, including Mr Milosevic and four of his top allies. Returning from the Hague, the Serbian justice minister, Vladan Batic, said that the court was \"a reality, maybe a harsh reality, but something that cannot be ignored\".

The bizarre plan would have seen fireworks graphically superimposed on television screens to convince the world that the capital was enjoying a spectacular night. Bob Geldof, who had been contracted to organise the celebrations, scorned the idea in a letter seen by the Guardian. \"For one shining moment, London could have been on par with North Korea for shameless media manipulation,\" Mr Geldof wrote. The former pop star added that plans to \"have a show worth putting on the world's TV screens to rival Paris, Sydney and New York\" were dashed when the fireworks scheduled for midnight had to be moved to 5pm instead. He disclosed that an official of one major public agency \"apparently seriously recommend to a minuted meeting that we should fake the fireworks at midnight with TV graphics\". An inquiry by the Greater London Assembly on Monday will blame the fiasco firmly on the dome minister, Lord Falconer, a close ally of the prime minister, and three leading members of the cabinet - John Prescott, the deputy prime minister; Jack Straw, the home secretary and Chris Smith, the culture secretary. Confidential Whitehall documents reveal that all four ministers approved London's fireworks display, but only Mr Smith, took action to get extra funds for the event - by writing personally to Tony Blair. Letters from Keith Hill, the minister for London, show how the contract for the display was signed by the Department of the Environment before it was handed over to Ken Livingstone, London's mayor. When Mr Livingstone objected to the terms, ministers used statutory powers to force him to accept the deal. In one letter, Mr Hill told Mr Prescott: \"The idea of a London new year event was launched by Charlie Falconer, on behalf of No 10, and is very much a central initiative.\" Another Whitehall memo written on February 23 last year says: \"On January 5 Lord Falconer (prompted, we understand, by No 10) told the media that London will be 'the international focus for New Year's Eve' and 'there was no intention to use taxpayers' money'.

      "body": "<p>The winner of a special award at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles tomorrow could well be Sacheen Littlefeather. She does not have a supporting role in Erin Brockovich nor does she vanquish wild animals in Gladiator, but her place in the Oscars' history is already assured. She was the woman who, in 1973, appeared on behalf of Marlon Brando, a winner for his performance in The Godfather, and rejected the award in protest against Hollywood's treatment of native Americans. </p> <p>This year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is running a competition to discover \"My favourite Oscar memory\" and asking members of the public to vote by clicking on the \"fun and games\" section of oscar.com. The results will be announced just in advance of the ceremony itself, and the spectacular intervention of the woman who described herself as Sacheen Littlefeather has been included as one of 15 contenders, along with rather less political moments such as Roberto Benigni climbing over the seats to receive his prize for Life Is Beautiful in 1999, Cuba Gooding Jnr's enthusiastic acceptance of the best supporting actor award in 1995 and the streaker who appeared behind David Niven in 1974. While Littlefeather (she is described on the official Oscar site as the Mexican-American actress Maria Cruz) may not have imagined that her intervention would one day appear in the \"fun and games\" section of an Oscar competition, the fact that it is recognised as a possible favourite memory is encouraging. </p> <p>Barely a day seems to pass now when an award ceremony is not screened on television. If we had a dollar for every \"humbled\" and \"honoured\" and for every time God had been credited with playing a part in the winning of this or that prize, we would be able to start our own award ceremony. Over the past few years, the chance to use the occasion to make a point - any point - seems to have been almost lost. </p> <p>During this year's Emmy music awards in Los Angeles, the musician Robbie Robertson, formerly of The Band, was able to slip in a reference to Leonard Peltier, the native American many feel to have been wrongly imprisoned for the last quarter of a century for the murder of two FBI agents and whose supporters had campaigned for a pardon from Bill Clinton. He was not, suggested Robertson at the Emmys, \"Marc Rich\" enough to win a pardon. In the Golden Globes earlier this year, George Clooney used his award for his role in O, Brother Where Art Thou? to make a witty \"confession\" that he was the illegitimate love-child of the sternly rightwing and anti-abortion new US attorney general, John Ashcroft. The year after Littlefeather's appearance, Bert Schneider and Peter Davis, the producer and director of the award-winning documentary Hearts and Minds, used their prize to talk about the war in Vietnam and read a telegram from the Vietcong delegation to the Paris peace talks.

      "bodyText": "The winner of a special award at the Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles tomorrow could well be Sacheen Littlefeather. She does not have a supporting role in Erin Brockovich nor does she vanquish wild animals in Gladiator, but her place in the Oscars' history is already assured. She was the woman who, in 1973, appeared on behalf of Marlon Brando, a winner for his performance in The Godfather, and rejected the award in protest against Hollywood's treatment of native Americans. This year the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is running a competition to discover \"My favourite Oscar memory\" and asking members of the public to vote by clicking on the \"fun and games\" section of oscar.com. The results will be announced just in advance of the ceremony itself, and the spectacular intervention of the woman who described herself as Sacheen Littlefeather has been included as one of 15 contenders, along with rather less political moments such as Roberto Benigni climbing over the seats to receive his prize for Life Is Beautiful in 1999, Cuba Gooding Jnr's enthusiastic acceptance of the best supporting actor award in 1995 and the streaker who appeared behind David Niven in 1974. While Littlefeather (she is described on the official Oscar site as the Mexican-American actress Maria Cruz) may not have imagined that her intervention would one day appear in the \"fun and games\" section of an Oscar competition, the fact that it is recognised as a possible favourite memory is encouraging. Barely a day seems to pass now when an award ceremony is not screened on television. If we had a dollar for every \"humbled\" and \"honoured\" and for every time God had been credited with playing a part in the winning of this or that prize, we would be able to start our own award ceremony. Over the past few years, the chance to use the occasion to make a point - any point - seems to have been almost lost. During this year's Emmy music awards in Los Angeles, the musician Robbie Robertson, formerly of The Band, was able to slip in a reference to Leonard Peltier, the native American many feel to have been wrongly imprisoned for the last quarter of a century for the murder of two FBI agents and whose supporters had campaigned for a pardon from Bill Clinton. He was not, suggested Robertson at the Emmys, \"Marc Rich\" enough to win a pardon. In the Golden Globes earlier this year, George Clooney used his award for his role in O, Brother Where Art Thou? to make a witty \"confession\" that he was the illegitimate love-child of the sternly rightwing and anti-abortion new US attorney general, John Ashcroft. The year after Littlefeather's appearance, Bert Schneider and Peter Davis, the producer and director of the award-winning documentary Hearts and Minds, used their prize to talk about the war in Vietnam and read a telegram from the Vietcong delegation to the Paris peace talks. But since then the edge has largely gone and it seems a long time since a genuinely provocative acceptance speech was made on Oscars' night. Winners are kept under tight reins in both content and time. Gone are the days when Greer Garson could speak for 10 minutes, as she did after winning for her portrayal of Mrs Miniver in 1942. Now the swelling orchestral music will cut off the wordier speakers after 45 seconds and so anxious are the organisers for short and sweet addresses that they are offering a free television set to the makers of the briefest speeches; although offering a free telly to some of the richest people in the world may seem a bit like offering a chocolate to a crouching tiger to persuade it not to eat you.

At least, this is the definition of a bear market that journalists have seized upon this week to justify front page billing in the broadsheets. </p> <p>My preferred definition is when stock market falls make it onto page two of the Sun. Arbitrary, I know. But no more arbitrary than a 20% Rubicon. Are things so much worse after a 20.1% fall than a 19.9% one? </p> <p>I don't think so. Indeed they may be somewhat better. Bringing falling share prices to the attention of a wider audience can only accelerate the catharsis that typically marks the turning point in equity markets. </p> <p>What is an investor to do now that his or her suffering has been laid bare to the casual observer? With apologies to director Gary Fleder, here is my guide to Things To Do In Markets When You're Dead. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Flick the switch</strong> </p> <p> You'll never make rational investment decisions if you're mesmerised by the gyrating prices on your screen. Steel yourself not to look at prices, read market reports or talk to stockbrokers during trading hours. Markets are not going to turn for the better just because you will them to. And prices have fallen so far that it matters little if you miss the first inch of their eventual recovery. </p> <p> <strong> 2. Pound the streets</strong> </p> <p> You don't just need a sense of perspective; you need the widest possible perspective. The best investment opportunities will be those you discover by observation of the workings of the economy in the aftermath of the stock market collapse. If you can bear it, take the taxi driver litmus test. </p> <p> <strong> 3. Read a good book</strong> </p> <p> History never repeats itself exactly, but you owe it to yourself to be acquainted with the bear markets of yesteryear. At least if history does then repeat itself you can't say that you weren't warned. I'd recommend JK Galbraith's The Great Crash, a brief but insightful analysis of 1929 and all that went before and aft. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Avoid collateral damage</strong> </p> <p> In 1987 the real economy emerged from the crash virtually unscathed. This time the world may not be so lucky. It will take time for share price damage to have its full effect elsewhere. Use this opportunity to pull out of that house move, sell your granny's Gaugin and ask your boss for an extended contract. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Dust off the abacus</strong> </p> <p> Down and dirty financial analysis has been out of vogue for a couple of years. As share prices fall, so value emerges. But you'll only spot it if you are looking for it. And this means poring over the numbers not chasing dreams. You can afford to keep it simple. Thoroughness will pay greater dividends than sloppy sophistication. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Beware false prophets</strong> </p> <p> Nobody knows where markets are going - not me, not you, not Abby Cohen at Goldman Sachs or the anonymous authors of Lex in the Financial Times. Your view has as much or as little validity as anyone else's. Keep this in mind and, when your analysis tells you it's time to buy, you'll find you have the requisite bravery. </p> <p> <strong> 7. Don't shoot the analysts</strong> </p> <p> The backlash against investment bank analysts is in full swing. Don't be diverted by the spectacle, however enjoyable it might appear. Use the research available dispassionately. As in all human life, you'll find there's good and bad there. Just be sure, once you've digested, to formulate your own conclusions. </p> <p> <strong> 8. Rebase to zero</strong> </p> <p> Ignore charts of historic share price performance. How a company was valued at its peak is no guide to its value today. Those shares that have fallen furthest may yet have further to fall. Start with a blank sheet of paper - no prejudices or preconceptions - and build an investment argument that reflects today's reality as you perceive it. </p> <p> <strong> 9. Yield to temptation</strong> </p> <p> Equities are but one tidbit on the investment smorgasbord. One way of comparing them with other asset classes is through their dividend yield. Seek out shares whose yields are approaching those on government bonds. Although unfashionable, this could prove the way back into the market with the least risk. Just be sure those dividends can be met out of the companies' profits. </p> <p> <strong> 10. Look for leverage</strong> </p> <p> Courage mon brave! When you decide the time has come to invest, be sure to do so with conviction. Use leverage to your advantage - be prepared to borrow; consider the use of derivative instruments. You could be a hero of the next bull market, if only in your granny's eyes. </p> <p>In this column last week I declared that my intuition was to begin to buy equities. Now we're in a bear market (Wapping definition), that intuition remains the same. Please accord the gut feeling of this single observer the minuscule weight it merits (see Things To Do No 6 above).

      "bodyText": "London's standing as Europe's leading financial centre has received a boost from top French bankers who complain that overbearing business taxes could see them leave Paris for the Square Mile. One banker told the French upper house that the costs of employing someone in London were less than half those for a Paris employee on the same net salary. In a bid to bolster the city's standing as a financial centre Paris Europlace, an umbrella organisation representing the financial services industry, is demanding the French government cuts tax and social security costs. This week it submitted a report to the government outlining a strategy to make Paris more competitive and underlining the importance of the financial services industry to the French economy. \"For us taxation and social security costs are a very important part of this [strategy],\" a spokesman said. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper Jean Peyrelevade, the head of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest banks, acknowledged that there was very strong pressure from staff within the bank in Paris to relocate them to London. His remarks have been interpreted as a sign that the bank could be thinking of moving to the UK. However a spokesman for the bank said yesterday: \"He did not say that a lot of people were going to move to London or that Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais was going to move to London. What he did say was that there was a lot of demand from people interested in working in London.\" The newspaper quoted the president of BNP Paribas, Michel P\u00e9bereau's comments to a committee of the French senate: \"For an annual income of \u00a390,000 after taxes and social charges an unmarried executive costs his employer Ffr3.663m (around \u00a3366,000) if he is employed in France, Ffr2.095m if he is employed in Germany, Ffr1.584m in the United Kingdom and Ffr1.35m in Switzerland.\" In its report to the government Paris Europlace argues that the industry deserves support because it accounts for 3.7% of jobs in France and makes a bigger contribution to the French economy than the agri-food sector or the car industry.",

It is set off with fine silver jewellery - or maybe it is platinum - and a fresh French manicure.</p> <p>This is Fiona Harrison, new chief executive of the Liberty department store in London and the sort of woman who makes 99.9% of other females feel like Nora Batty. \"Do let me check your cup,\" she says, slowly spinning the fine bone china teacup. The dishwasher is playing up and the odd drip mark might not have been eradicated - she simply cannot countenance a guest taking a sip out of anything that is not sparkling. </p> <p>The dishwasher has done its stuff and we can proceed. Mrs Harrison is a daunting and towering woman, 5ft 10in, with enough charm to fill anexecutive suite. She is Liberty's third chief executive in as many years and her mission is to put the renowned Regent Street store back in the fashion shopping superleague - and to create a global luxury brand at the same time. Founded in 1875, Liberty should be the West End's answer to Harvey Nichols and Harrods in Knightsbridge. While the latter, and more recently Selfridges and DH Evans, have grown and prospered, Liberty has fallen into the red.</p> <p> <strong>Creaking floors</strong> </p> <p>The store, with its Tudor-style frontage, is a London landmark.

It is not a straightforward job because the buildings are listed and both English Heritage and the Crown Estate - which owns Regent Street - have to be consulted. </p> <p>Mrs Harrison wants to cash in on Liberty's distinct character. \"It is not difficult for us to be different and unique. We have an absolute point of difference to our rivals just because of the building.\"</p> <p>She envisages a store unlike any other in London, where the customer service is more like that found in designer boutiques than traditional department stores. She wants a different atmosphere - and is toying with playing soft jazz in the background to help create it. A destination restaurant would rival the capital's trendiest celebrity eateries and Mrs Harrison also aims to pull in the big power brands not stocked. </p> <p>\"We don't have the glitzy brands like Gucci and Prada, but they are traffic drivers.\" A quick walk around points up the problem. There are too few chic women and too many Japanese students and elderly couples. Mrs Harrison reckons 20% of the business is generated by tourists, mainly Japanese and American. The Regent Street side of the store, previously housing menswear, has already closed for a revamp and will reopen in November with different merchandise on each level. Phase two of the Harrison plan will see the builders move in to the Tudor building for a two-year update. Not that there has been a shortage of such ideas in recent years. Liberty has had more cunning plans than Baldrick, some so grand they ran aground before you could say silk scarf. Six years ago the founding Stewart-Liberty family called in Denis Cassidy but his proposals, including a \u00a340m revamp, so infuriated family shareholders they joined forces with corporate raiders to oust the former Bhs boss. A new chairman and chief executive took over, planning to shut the Regent Street building but, before work could start, property developers Marylebone Warwick Balfour bought the business and hired Mrs Harrison. It is her first foray into luxury brands. </p> <p>The 50-year-old daughter of a panel beater and a secretary, Mrs Harrison was brought up in Hertfordshire. After grammar school and a chemistry degree at Leicester University she joined packaging group Metal Box, before moving to Boots as a buyer. \"I was the first woman to buy electricals at Boots,\" she says. The company is still close to her heart and she is now a non-executive director. </p> <p>In 1977 Mrs Harrison joined Clairol to develop electrical personal care products. The green hairdryer, footspa and flexible hair rollers were all her babies. \"I had three years at Clairol, spending two weeks in the US and then two weeks in the UK. I used to wake up in the morning and look at the curtains to see what country I was in,\" she said. Her lifestyle remains international. Her husband of 25 years works for packaging group Crown Cork &amp; Seal and is based in Paris, so the couple, who have no children, alternate between homes in Paris and London. Spare time is spent listening to jazz, blues and opera or watching rugby. </p> <p>After Clairol she was headhunted by textiles group Coats Viyella to run their Van Heusen, Berghaus, Viyella and Jaeger clothing businesses. She left in 1998 \"after several depressing years characterised by closing factories\". After three months looking at educational action zones in the East End of London, she joined Stork &amp; May, a career consultancy group for senior executives. \"I was off on a new career,\" she says, \"and then I got the call about Liberty.\" <strong>Staying put</strong></p> <p>She started in December and her mission has been compared to the challenge Burberry faced three years ago. Burberry has risen to that so well that it is now valued at up to \u00a32bn. </p> <p>Mrs Harrison bristles at the comparison. \"People say I am going to do a Burberry. In so far as we are going to grow our brand, it is true. But there the comparison stops\". </p> <p>She gets out a pen and paper and draws a long line, with Burberry at one end and Harvey Nichols at the other. She stabs at the middle and says: \"We are here. We are a retailer with a brand capable of development. The opportunity I see is to develop a range of luxury products branded Liberty to be sold around the world from other outlets.\" </p> <p>She swiftly stamped on plans to pull out of Regent Street. \"It is very important to us because it is a major thoroughfare. It has been Liberty's address for ever, it is a window on the world and it provides a lot of the traffic into the Tudor.\"</p> <p>Mrs Harrison has axed the Liberty ready-to-wear high fashion label, along with the e-commerce and mail order businesses. \"We were stretching our resources and our investment funds too thinly. We have to have greater clarity and focus on our core activity. Twothirds of the Liberty business is in this store and the London store has been starved of investment.\" </p> <p>Turning the store around, she says, will be a long job - two years to get the retailing right, then much more to build a global, big ticket brand.

      "body": "<p>They called themselves \"the Dream Team\" - a band of armed robbers so skilled, daring and meticulous that their average haul for a five-minute raid, with no clues left behind, was a million pounds.</p> <p>For four years this tight-knit band tormented police in Spain and France, carrying out swift and brutal raids from Paris to Malaga. They struck at security vans, airport cargo zones, security company vaults - even a passenger plane as it taxied on a runway.</p> <p>They always employed massive firepower, explosives, body armour and fast cars. They always disappeared without trace. Their hauls, usually cash or jewels, were so huge that they only needed to do two or three jobs a year. Nine raids netted them \u00a315m.</p> <p>The gang's spectacular heists often appeared to come straight out of a Hollywood script. In fact, police say, the Dream Team hero-worshipped Robert De Niro and modelled themselves on the gangs he led in the films Heat and Ronin. They even gave themselves code-names based on the films' characters and used the same Audi 8 get-away cars as in Heat.</p> <p>Police across Europe were baffled by the brilliant robbers.Were they Serbs, Albanians, Italians, French, Spaniards, Moroccans or a mixture? Interpol was called in. Underworld sources from Hamburg to Marseilles and from Naples to Marbella were quizzed. Nobody had heard of them.</p> <p>For Inspector Daniel Bernabe, head of Barcelona's armed crime group, they became an obsession. Just 33 years old but prematurely aged by his job, and with two bullets wounds from shoot-outs with armed robbers, he found it hard to believe they were so good.</p> <p>\"They are simply the best that Europe has ever seen,\" he says. \"They were the best-organised, the most disciplined, the most security-conscious and most tightly-knit group anybody had come across.\" Now, after a series of raids in Marbella, Barcelona and Paris last December, he believes he has the nine Dream Team members behind bars. A massive arsenal of weapons and munitions, including 20 sub-machine guns and a hand-held anti-tank rocket launcher, as well as the evidence of witnesses and wiretaps, form a large body of evidence which Insp Bernabe hopes will send them to jail for up to 30 years each.</p> <p>The Dream Team members, allegedly led by a Frenchman, Daniel Bellanger, are charged in Spanish and French courts with belonging to an armed group, robbery and possession of arms. They have all denied the charges.</p> <p>Mr Bellanger led a life of unostentatious luxury. He shared a villa with his wife and children in the resort of Sitges, south of Barcelona. He partied with Spanish aristocrats and film stars, telling them he was a successful luxury car dealer.</p> <p>\"We believe Bellanger was the chief - an ice-cold, intelligent, superior character who picked the targets and planned the jobs,\" Insp Bernabe says. \"They were a small army, united by quality and friendship. They knew they were all good.\"</p> <p>Like the rest of those charged, which included two former rugby players from the French club Perpignan, Jean-Jacques Naudo and Karim Maloum, he was obsessive about personal fitness. \"They were a close group. They would go to see Barcelona play football, then they would go out nightclubbing. But it did not matter what they had been doing the night before, they would be in the gym, playing tennis or golf, riding or jogging the next morning.\"</p> <p>Nobody knows how the Dream Team, most of whose alleged members do not have significant police records, was brought together. However, their first job showed just how inventive and disciplined they could be.</p> <p>An Air Inter Airbus carrying 200 passengers was taxiing towards a runway at Perpignan airport when a group of what had appeared to be ground personnel suddenly donned balaclavas and aimed Kalashnikovs at the flight deck. The startled captain found himself staring into a banner held up by two of the gang. \"Stop your motors now. This is a robbery.\" A few rounds of automatic gunfire helped the pilot make up his mind.</p> <p>Within minutes the gang had blown off the cargo hold doors and lifted \u00a3800,000. As with all their raids, it had lasted less than ten minutes.</p> <p>\"That was so good it almost seemed funny,\" Insp Bernabe admits. \"Each job required masses of preparation. And they always behaved, in the meantime, as if the police were following them.\"</p> <p>Having invented the airport runway robbery, the Dream Team perfected a technique for assaulting security vans. First practised in Limoges in 1996, this involved wedging the van between two trucks and putting thick metal blinds - attached by industrial magnets - across the holes the security guards usually used to shoot at raiders.</p> <p>A concentrated explosive charge then blew a small hole in the truck and the terrified guards were forced at gunpoint to hand out the money. An amateur video of their last raid, in Paris's Gentilly district, shows the six robbers operating like a well-trained army commando unit. \"On these raids they carried more than 20kg of material each,\" Insp Bernabe says. \"They were equipped with body armour, grenades, machine guns, spare magazine clips and munition belts.\" Other raids included a \u00a32m cash and diamonds heist at Malaga airport and a raid on a security company deposit in France when they literally bulldozed their way in.</p> <p>Police believe that, if necessary, the Dream Team would have killed. In fact, they never had to.</p> <p>\"As professionals, they knew it was better not to kill anyone,\" says Insp Bernabe \"That did not, however, stop them shooting at French police when they turned up\"</p> <p>In one raid, when they tried to hijack the takings of a gang of hashish traffickers in Algeciras, southern Spain, the group's second-in-command, a former soldier called Michel Crutel, was killed in a shootout. It was a sign that the gang's luck was running out.</p> <p>Police in Perpignan had begun to hear tales of their adventures. They had tipped off Insp Bernabe.</p> <p>The suspect's homes were bugged. One alleged team member, Bruno Celini, was discovered living in Budapest. \"What did for them in the end was that we found out where they all lived,\" Insp Bernabe says.</p> <p>When a Fr34m (\u00a33.2m) raid on a Brinks security van in Paris went wrong, police tailed some of the team to the safe house where they kept their supply of armaments.</p> <p>Arrests followed at luxury villas and apartments in Gerona, Barcelona and Marbella. Neighbours invariably spoke of how polite the people alleged to be Europe's best armed robbers were.</p> <p>Now Insp Bernabe says life has become boring because there have been no further raids. \"My team agrees we have become better because of the Dream Team. But now most armed robbers look to us like amateurs beside them.\"</p>",

Just 33 years old but prematurely aged by his job, and with two bullets wounds from shoot-outs with armed robbers, he found it hard to believe they were so good. \"They are simply the best that Europe has ever seen,\" he says. \"They were the best-organised, the most disciplined, the most security-conscious and most tightly-knit group anybody had come across.\" Now, after a series of raids in Marbella, Barcelona and Paris last December, he believes he has the nine Dream Team members behind bars. A massive arsenal of weapons and munitions, including 20 sub-machine guns and a hand-held anti-tank rocket launcher, as well as the evidence of witnesses and wiretaps, form a large body of evidence which Insp Bernabe hopes will send them to jail for up to 30 years each. The Dream Team members, allegedly led by a Frenchman, Daniel Bellanger, are charged in Spanish and French courts with belonging to an armed group, robbery and possession of arms. They have all denied the charges. Mr Bellanger led a life of unostentatious luxury. He shared a villa with his wife and children in the resort of Sitges, south of Barcelona. He partied with Spanish aristocrats and film stars, telling them he was a successful luxury car dealer. \"We believe Bellanger was the chief - an ice-cold, intelligent, superior character who picked the targets and planned the jobs,\" Insp Bernabe says. \"They were a small army, united by quality and friendship. They knew they were all good.\" Like the rest of those charged, which included two former rugby players from the French club Perpignan, Jean-Jacques Naudo and Karim Maloum, he was obsessive about personal fitness. \"They were a close group. They would go to see Barcelona play football, then they would go out nightclubbing. But it did not matter what they had been doing the night before, they would be in the gym, playing tennis or golf, riding or jogging the next morning.\" Nobody knows how the Dream Team, most of whose alleged members do not have significant police records, was brought together. However, their first job showed just how inventive and disciplined they could be. An Air Inter Airbus carrying 200 passengers was taxiing towards a runway at Perpignan airport when a group of what had appeared to be ground personnel suddenly donned balaclavas and aimed Kalashnikovs at the flight deck. The startled captain found himself staring into a banner held up by two of the gang. \"Stop your motors now. This is a robbery.\" A few rounds of automatic gunfire helped the pilot make up his mind. Within minutes the gang had blown off the cargo hold doors and lifted \u00a3800,000. As with all their raids, it had lasted less than ten minutes. \"That was so good it almost seemed funny,\" Insp Bernabe admits. \"Each job required masses of preparation. And they always behaved, in the meantime, as if the police were following them.\" Having invented the airport runway robbery, the Dream Team perfected a technique for assaulting security vans. First practised in Limoges in 1996, this involved wedging the van between two trucks and putting thick metal blinds - attached by industrial magnets - across the holes the security guards usually used to shoot at raiders. A concentrated explosive charge then blew a small hole in the truck and the terrified guards were forced at gunpoint to hand out the money. An amateur video of their last raid, in Paris's Gentilly district, shows the six robbers operating like a well-trained army commando unit. \"On these raids they carried more than 20kg of material each,\" Insp Bernabe says. \"They were equipped with body armour, grenades, machine guns, spare magazine clips and munition belts.\" Other raids included a \u00a32m cash and diamonds heist at Malaga airport and a raid on a security company deposit in France when they literally bulldozed their way in. Police believe that, if necessary, the Dream Team would have killed. In fact, they never had to. \"As professionals, they knew it was better not to kill anyone,\" says Insp Bernabe \"That did not, however, stop them shooting at French police when they turned up\" In one raid, when they tried to hijack the takings of a gang of hashish traffickers in Algeciras, southern Spain, the group's second-in-command, a former soldier called Michel Crutel, was killed in a shootout. It was a sign that the gang's luck was running out. Police in Perpignan had begun to hear tales of their adventures. They had tipped off Insp Bernabe. The suspect's homes were bugged. One alleged team member, Bruno Celini, was discovered living in Budapest. \"What did for them in the end was that we found out where they all lived,\" Insp Bernabe says. When a Fr34m (\u00a33.2m) raid on a Brinks security van in Paris went wrong, police tailed some of the team to the safe house where they kept their supply of armaments. Arrests followed at luxury villas and apartments in Gerona, Barcelona and Marbella. Neighbours invariably spoke of how polite the people alleged to be Europe's best armed robbers were. Now Insp Bernabe says life has become boring because there have been no further raids. \"My team agrees we have become better because of the Dream Team. But now most armed robbers look to us like amateurs beside them.\"",

Establishing the Pentagon study, President George Bush ordered his defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, and his team of advisers to \"challenge the status quo\" and to \"skip a generation of technology\". All the early signs are that this is exactly what the planners have done. The key person in the review process is a career Pentagon official, Andrew Marshall, 79, a man routinely described in profiles as \"legendary\" and \"the most influential person in the world you've never heard of\". Mr Marshall has been an adviser to every US defence secretary since the Nixon administration and is a long-term advocate of US missile defence and of a more confrontational stance towards China, both of which are central tenets of the Pentagon rethink. Mr Rumsfeld has entrusted Mr Marshall with the decisive role in a review which is intended to impose lasting changes in the way that the Pentagon budget, set this year at $310.5bn - or a third of the total amount spent on the military in all parts of the globe - is divided up. Mr Bush has indicated that US defence spending will get an even bigger increase than this year's $14.2bn - or 4.8 % -rise. By putting Mr Marshall in charge of the review, Mr Rumsfeld has signalled that he does not want the armed services to set their own agenda. Reports in Washington say that the three service chiefs have been largely excluded from decisive stages of the review process. Mr Rumsfeld briefed the service chiefs this week about the preliminary findings of the review in a manner that was said to be \"brusque\". It will mark a sharp shift in emphasis. Less than three weeks ago President George Bush presided at the Virginia launching ceremony for the USS Ronald Reagan, the ninth and latest of the US Navy's massive Nimitz-class aircraft carriers that have been the centrepieces of American battle planning since the end of the Vietnam war more than 25 years ago. But the ship that Mr Bush hymned on March 4 as \"one hundred thousand tons of American power\" and which the Pentagon boasted would \"serve the fleet for 50 years\" now looks certain to be the last of its kind, and may even be held back from the frontline role for which it was originally conceived. Gargantuan $5bn aircraft carriers like the Reagan, each carrying 80 aircraft and with a crew of 6,000, have been identified by the Pentagon as too big and too expensive a target in the missile-dominated warfare that US military chiefs now believe will characterise the 21st century. Initial leaks from the wide-ranging US defence review set in motion by the Bush admin istration suggested yesterday that Mr Rumsfeld is about to order the Navy to stop building Nimitz class carriers immediately. Instead the Navy will be instructed to rethink its carrier capacity in favour of smaller, faster and more manoeuvrable vessels that are less vulnerable to missiles. \"The big loser is the carrier,\" a source told the Washington Post yesterday, which broke the story. The big winner in the review, by contrast, is likely to be the US Air Force (USAF). Pentagon planners have decided that the key to the future of warfare is likely to lie with long distance bombers and unmanned aircraft and that \"long range power projection\" - including the requirement to airlift large numbers of troops and mat\u00e9riel halfway around the world from bases in the US - is the challenge of the future. However, the USAF will be disappointed by the review's emphasis on less spending on jet fighter planes. The central question here is the future of the F-22 stealth fighter, which is scheduled to replace the existing F-15 as the principal US combat plane during the next decade in a $350bn programme. Reports yesterday suggested that the air force will be told to cut the number of F-22s on its order books, largely on the grounds that its range may not be sufficient to fit the new thinking. The US currently has 1,384,000 military personnel of all types on active duty, divided between the army with 482,000, the navy with 373,000, the air force with 356,000 and the US Marine Corps with 173,000. The overwhelming majority of these - around 1.13m - are based in the continental US and in American territories overseas, such as Guam and Puerto Rico. The US has 117,000 service men and women stationed in Europe, including 69,000 in Germany and 11,000 in each of Britain and Italy. There are just over 5,000 US troops in Bosnia and the same number in Kosovo. In East Asia and the Pacific, the US has 101,000 service personnel, of whom 40,000 are in Japan and 37,000 in South Korea. The other major concentrations of US forces are in Saudi Arabia 7,000 and Kuwait 5,000. In retrospect, Mr Bush seemed to be hinting only a few weeks ago that a turning point had been reached in military planning on the use of aircraft carriers. \"For the last 60 years, every president has had to ask, 'Where are the carriers?' None has ever been disappointed by the navy's response,\" Mr Bush said at the launch of the USS Ronald Reagan. \"But he cannot live forever on that legacy. Our challenge is to build a military that will deter and win the wars of the future.\" The nuclear-powered Nimitz-class aircraft carriers have been in service since the first of them, the USS Nimitz, was commissioned in 1975. At present, five of the eight commissioned Nimitz carriers are with the US fifth fleet in the Arabian gulf and with the sixth fleet in the Mediterranean. The other three are with the much larger seventh fleet in the Pacific ocean, and are mostly based in Japan.",

I saw the remains of it again the other day, high above 43rd Street, the dead vines washed grey against the dark metalwork. If I had appreciated it and remembered its location, no doubt I was one of many who had enjoyed it and thought: that was a success. </p> <p>Suppose it were a success not to be repeated. Suppose the instigator of this garden had simply thought: this year, I feel like seeing Morning Glories every morning, and for a summer had revelled in the triumph of the project - but the following year were to turn to something else. Would there be something wrong with that? </p> <p>I imagine the flower forever having a particular association for the owner of this \"garden\" - this nondescript container dumped on a fire escape, which suddenly, and so satisfactorily, took off. Whatever the summer of 2000 meant would be summed up by the sight of Heavenly Blue Ipomoea tricolor (no 76). </p> <p>To me it means sleeping under a trellis in Greece, but Ipomoea is historically associated with Central America. A quick check in the Codex Badianus, an Aztec herbal now in the Vatican, gives us the Fever Flower, Tontonquixochitl, and a recipe against hair loss: \"falling hair is checked by washing the head, and if the herb called xiuhhamolli is applied to it, ground and cooked in the urine of a dog or a stag, with tree frogs and the small animals auatecolotl\" (apparently a kind of caterpillar). </p> <p>What the codex fails to impart is the recipe for deriving LSD from I tricolor , which was the standard Aztec hallucinogen. An illustration of the associative power of the flower is the fact that Morning Glory always lifts the heart, whereas the common white convolvulus (so very similar in form) always causes it to sink. I have not tried the white version of Morning Glory (\"Pearly Gates\") for that reason. There are reds on offer as well. I batatas, as the name more than hints, is the Sweet Potato. </p> <p>The smaller the garden, the greater the interest in extending it by means of climbers. Some small town houses have no garden at all, but the house itself has been interpreted as, first and foremost, a support for a rampant clematis or wisteria. I like these examples of horticultural excess very much, but where there is the opportunity to grow just a few more plants, it is the smaller climbers that will attract the attention of the householder. They are less likely to crowd their neighbours out. </p> <p>Early on, I mentioned the common nasturtium, Tropaeolum majus, grown in the courtyard of a Boston museum, massed in windowboxes. The windows in question are extraordinary, having been transported from Venetian palazzi. The planting might have looked foolish had it been done with anything less than total conviction. As it was, with cascades of nasturtiums, one felt one was seeing the flower used properly for the first time. </p> <p>An illusion, of course, that the self-confident can create. There are many other tropaeolums, including one that features in that useful book, Lost Crops of the Incas. T tuberosum, known to us in the form \"Ken Aslet\" (boil the tubers with meat), and to South Americans as mashua, a crop for high altitudes which (mark this now) repels many insects and pathogens, and is handy for farmers who cannot afford pesticides. </p> <p>But the tropaeolum I am recommending from seed is no 77, the delicate yellow-flowered Canary Creeper T peregrinum, which comes from Peru and Ecuador and is for us a half-hardy annual. Another with which we have had success in southern England is a Chilean, no 78 T ciliatum, which we have growing up a yew hedge, where in Scotland one would more likely see the wonderful Flame Nasturtium T speciosum. </p> <p>Another Chilean/Peruvian, to pursue the theme, is the Glory Flower (no 79) Eccremocarpus scaber, which is a perfect climber for the small garden since it can climb through a shrub without giving it too much hassle. Orange and red tubular flowers, bright and small, are its contribution. We also grow Tresco Cream, which is presumably one of the constituents of Chilterns Seeds' offering, Tresco mixed. Listed as half-hardy, it is very likely to survive a town winter. </p> <p>Returning to Mexico, we encounter no 80, the astonishing Rhodochiton atrosangineum, another tender vine, with blood-black flowers (as its specific name warns us to expect) and a surprisingly pronounced calyx.

The authorities could not keep up with the burials and the corpses were left to decompose on the wayside, in shelters and open fields. </p> <p>Those animals that had not succumbed to the disease roamed free, and the fields went uncultivated. Some families voluntarily blockaded themselves in houses, others fled. Communities were barred to outsiders. Neighbour feared neighbour, travellers and vistors were turned away; xenophobia became rife and people were isolated and left to fend for themselves. </p> <p>As the disease came inexorably closer to communities, so the sense of fearfulness and impending calamity increased. Wild rumours, conspiracy theories and myths abounded. People appealed to the highest moral, medical and secular authorities, who all maintained they were in control of the situation, but in fact had little idea how to respond. The trust between government and people was eroded. </p> <p>Once the pestilence arrived, ignorance only added to the horror. People succumbed to fatalism, passivity and despair. The sense grew that no one could escape. The agrarian economy was temporaraily shattered, but out of the calamitous times it was widely hoped that profound change, economic betterment and a fuller understanding of the causes of the disaster would come.

The above description of a time of pestilence in England is, in fact, a composite, culled from many conversations between Guardian journalists, and farmers and rural dwellers in the past three weeks, as well as from the chronicles of the middle ages. </p> <p>On the level of broad national calamity, there is, of course, no comparison between the two ages or the pestilences themselves. The Black Death of 1428-30, spread by fleas and carried mostly by rats, killed up to a third of all Europeans. The foot and mouth epidemic now raging across half of Britain, and slowly moving into mainland Europe is, in contrast, only affecting animals, most of whom would normally be killed anyway. Where the plagues shook to their foundations a whole continent's social, moral, economic and institutional edifices, foot and mouth will marginally and temporarily cause deterioration of a single country's economy, lose a few thousand farmers their livelihood, and prematurely end the lives of half a million or more beasts. </p> <p>But plague historians in Europe, the US and Britain note that the responses to the two epidemics are strangely similar, with many parallels between these two distraught times. They suggest that when under siege from a real or perceived phantom enemy, society responds very much as it always has done, and that beneath all the progress and obvious advancements in medical knowledge of the past centuries, not much changes in the human or political condition. </p> <p>\"Certain ways of behaviour and certain reactions against fate throw mutual light upon each other,\" said the French medievalist Edouard Perroy. He was echoed in 1978 by the American historian Barbara Tuchman who sought to link medieval and modern times. \"The interval of 600 years permits what is significant in human character to stand out\", she said. The Swiss historian JCLS de Sismondi went further: \"There is a fellow feeling between both [ages]. They were bad for humanity. The rules were breaking down under the prescence of adverse and violent events. We recognise with a painful twinge the marks of a period of anguish when there is no sense of an assured future.\" </p> <p>Tuchman acknowledged that the people of the middle ages existed under mental, moral, and physical circumstances so different from our own as to constitute almost a foreign civilisation, but she argued that \"as a result, the qualities of conduct that we recognise as familiar amid these alien surroundings are revealed as permanent in human nature.\" </p> <p>Voltaire put it more succinctly: \"History never repeats itself but man always does.\" </p> <p>So let's look at the points of contact between the ages. The background to both disasters was superficially similar. At the start of the 14th century, there were, says Mark Ormrod, professor of medieval history at York University, a series of natural and man-made disasters, including famine, wars and massive floods that drowned many communities, especially in Kent and the south east. It rings a bell today with global warming being blamed for much of the recent flooding. </p> <p>\"The climate was changing\", says Ormrod. \"They were entering a mini ice age. Much of Britain's farmland was said to be exhausted by over-cultivation.\" The argument is that England was overpopulated. It had reached a point where it could no longer grow. Marginal land had been put under cultivation, but they didn't allow the land to lie fallow and yields dropped. Just as modern Britain has been plagued by BSE, salmonella and swine fever in the last decade, medieval writers reported widespread \"murraines\", or cattle diseases. </p> <p>Both societies, too, knew greater strife. We have the global traumas of Aids, environmental threats, and a massively growing world population; they had the local traumas of almost constant war and disease. Both were experiencing great change, institutional corruption and massive injustice. </p> <p>Today, everyone from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to the UN report widening gaps between rich and poor. In the 14th century, it was left to anonymous scribes to tell the same story. \"The valuable wool exports had halved between 1310 and 1345 and landowners were said to be in difficulty,\" says Ormrod. Wealth was increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few. Then, as now, he says, the cities were burgeoning as people came in to escape problems on the land. \"Regional trade was expanding and it was seen as a time of great opportunity as well one of shanty towns and destitution.\" </p> <p>The arrival of the two diseases struck similar chords. In both cases there had been a significant period without major human or animal plagues. The last widespread human pestilence, in the eighth century, had been long forgotten just as our own age mostly believed major foot and mouth outbreaks would never reappear; the last one was more than 30 years ago. </p> <p>We should have seen foot and mouth coming, just as medieval England could have foreseen the plague. For several years in the 14th century Europeans had been hearing of a mysterious and terrible pestilence approaching from the east, via China, India and Syria. It arrived in an unprepared Genoa. There was no understanding of it but no astonishment either when, having ravaged much of Europe, it finally landed in England via a ship at Melcombe Regis near Weymouth in Dorset in the summer of 1348. </p> <p>Today we see, with hindsight, that burgeoning world trade, ease of movement and dubious farming trades and techniques, had made a perfect incubator for foot and mouth disease to arrive and spread rapidly in Britain. Did the government and its vets not understand that there had been outbreaks in more than 60 countries in the past two years and that it was inevitable that foot and mouth would come? </p> <p>Equally, the medieval church, crown and civil service must have had time enough to prepare the people for the pestilence that was spreading fast down the world's trade routes. If the one age had a limited understanding of its own vulnerabilty, the other had but a limited knowlege of epidemiology. Both ages, it may be said, were wilfully blind. </p> <p>In the event, the diseases came with shocking rapidity and terrible fierceness. In neither case did the authorities have a clue how many - animals or people - would die. Nor did either society know precisely how the plagues spread or how they could be controlled. Just as one farm can get foot and mouth and its neighbour be spared, so there were great variations in the Black Death's toll. One village could escape for months, but it might sweep though the next in a matter of days. Few medieval families did not lose at least one member. \"But the culture of death was very important\", says Ormrod. \"It was more resilient to these shocks than modern society.\" </p> <p>When death came, the authorities of both ages reacted with relative complacency. Medieval England was effectively ruled by a clerical and royal elite with the church, in Tuchman's words, \"the all powerful matrix and law of life, omnipresent and all but compulsory\". It offered people salvation, and a cure for all ills. When the plague came, Christianity's first instinct was to do as it had always done in times of trouble: offer absolution, tell people to confess and pray harder, spray holy water around, blame their sinful ways , lock themselves up and isolate communities. The effect was to confirm the power of the establishment. </p> <p>Today, the only community of people in Britain effectively governed in the same way by a centralised power, and dependent utterly on a central authority for their survival, are the farmers. The European Union and the common agricultural policy, with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) a minor satellite dispensing what Europe broadly dictates, is as powerful as the medieval church. Its philosophy of rewarding production above all is as dogmatic as any religion. Its grip on the rural community is complete because farmers depend on the ministry for advice, favours and subsidies. No farmer can ignore the ministry and none may question its authority in times of trouble. </p> <p>When it came to foot and mouth, Maff, just like the medieval church, reached for what it knew. Sidelining the advancements in science and epedemiology, it instituted draconian laws, dusted off a 90-year-old mass slaughter policy designed to protect trade, advised people to stay away from the countryside, reached for its railway sleepers and quick-lime, lit the fires and argued from day one that it would kill first and ask questions later. Like a medieval pope, its will alone would be done. </p> <p>Maff is today like king, priest and politician rolled into one. Just as Rome centralised so much medieval power, oversaw all finance, and set itself up alone to grant the afterlife and ease the woes of the present, so the ministry in the foot and mouth crisis has the absolute power of life and death of animals. Maff allows no appeals and keeps its epidemiological results secret. It alone holds the cure to the present pestilence - the stocks of vaccinations which it refuses to use. No farmer or vet may treat foot and mouth, just as no medieval commoner was let into the secrets of the church. </p> <p>Just as the grasping and inefficient medieval church with its armies of ignorant clergy offered its suplicants absolution from sins in the temporal world and heaven in the hereafter, so the ministry today offers the promise of protection from the free market and the vaguer hope of future economic betterment. Just like the medieval church insisting on church attendance and admission of sins, however, the ministry attaches conditions - farmers must toe the line and raise their livestock in its approved ways. That other countries increasingly see Britain's farming as barbaric is immaterial. </p> <p>In the 14th century, dispensations, indulgences, benefices and pardons were all available from the church at a price. Today the subsidies - the modern reward system - go mostly to the rich farmers who have paid heavily for the intensification of their enterprises. The poor and small are marginalised and left to beg. Those - such as organic or sustainable farmers - whose views differ from Maff's are treated like heretics of the new church of industrial farming. </p> <p>Come the pestilences, both ages resorted to age-old \"cures\". Where the medieval church offered holy water to the serfs and peasantry, Maff proposes that farmers buy disinfectant as a protection from foot and mouth. In the 14th century, there were not enough priests to hear confessions and commoners were hurriedly allowed to pardon and absolve each other. </p> <p>Maff is appealing round the world for more vets and students to kill the animals and check for disease. Acccording to Abigail Woods, a vet and historian of foot and mouth, vets are \"a latterday professional clergy\". The first vets, she says, were referred to as \"the priests of nature\". </p> <p>The echoes reverberate down the ages. The Black Death is thought to have struck particularly at children. Foot and mouth has afflicted mostly young animals. Just as towns were ordered to ring their church bells to drive the 14th-century plague away, so the church bells of England are, by order of the Archbishop of Canter bury, to be tolled every Sunday in recognition of the crisis. When the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, the high priest of veterinary science, went this week into the heartland of the disease in Cumbria, he was jeered by the farmers, just as the priests of Europe were turned upon by mobs of roaming flagellants and anti-clericals as the plague took its toll. </p> <p>The flagellants were unique to mainland Europe and, according to Norman Cohn, the author of The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages (Pimlico, 1997), they saw themselves as redeemers and in groups of 200 or more marched from city to city, stripped to the waist, scourging themselves with whips. They became a revolutionary force; they persecuted the Jews, accusing them of poisoning wells and therefore causing the plague. \"There were no Jews in Britain because they had all been expelled in the previous century,\" says Ormrod. \"But there was a lot of xenophobia against foreigners. I can't help but think that if there had been Jews here, they would have been persecuted.\" </p> <p>As in the 14th century, the traditional enemies of the state, together with the weakest and the most powerful in the land, have been seen as the authors of misfortune. The supermarkets have been widely blamed in the media and there have been rumours that refugees brought in the virus while fleeing the world's poorest countries. Meanwhile, animal welfare groups have been investigated for allegedly spreading the disease because they were so appalled by the conditions of modern farming. In the plague years the devil was blamed. Today, according to other rumours, Saddam Hussein is accused of practising biological warfare. </p> <p>When the first medieval plague was over - there were six more in the next 60 years - the world had changed. In the words of one anonymous French chronicler: \"Blank spaces opened on all sides in human society, stunned and for a time destroyed the life and faith of the world.\" Above all, the population had declined by up to 40% and took centuries to fully recover. In Britain, as elsewhere, peasants took the opportunity to increase their land holdings. Times were better economically for the survivors. </p> <p>The church emerged from the epidemic years richer, but far more unpopular. Personal attacks on the clergy increased. British medieval historians, including Barry Dobson, former professor of medieval history at Cambridge University, have researched the decline of the role of the church and the rise of the laity. Within 30 years of the plague, the peasant's revolt against the poll tax, foreshadowing the modern revolt against Margaret Thatcher's version of the tax, had further rocked the English ship of state. \"The end of an age of submission came in sight,\" says Tuchman. \"To that extent, the Black Death may have been the unrecognised beginnings of modern society.\" </p> <p>Will Europe and Britain be transformed after foot and mouth? As in medieval times, there are loud cries for change and a certain optimism. Politicians and farmers, the media and the voluble agrarian reform groups across the continent already see this as a watershed time, an opportunity to rethink agriculture and the relationship between town and country and all the different players. They may be pushing at an open door, or it is equally possible that it will take more disaster, as in the 14th century, to see real change. </p> <p>In John Dryden's words: \"For mankind is ever the same and nothing is lost out of nature, though everything is altered.\" </p> <p>\u0095 A Distant Mirror by Barbara Tuchman (Macmillan, 1978)<br> \u0095 The Black Death In England, ed Mark Ormrod and Philip Lindley (Paul Watkins Stamford, 1996) <br> \u0095 The Black Death by Philip Zeigler (Penguin, 1997) <br> \u0095 Medieval Economy and Society by Michael Postan (Penguin, 1975); <br> \u0095 The Black Death by Rosemary Horrox (Manchester University Press, 1994)<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Each day, many thousands died. The land was empty, the villages silent. Fires smouldered for weeks, the acrid palls of smoke drifting lazily over the hills and valleys. The authorities could not keep up with the burials and the corpses were left to decompose on the wayside, in shelters and open fields. Those animals that had not succumbed to the disease roamed free, and the fields went uncultivated. Some families voluntarily blockaded themselves in houses, others fled. Communities were barred to outsiders. Neighbour feared neighbour, travellers and vistors were turned away; xenophobia became rife and people were isolated and left to fend for themselves. As the disease came inexorably closer to communities, so the sense of fearfulness and impending calamity increased. Wild rumours, conspiracy theories and myths abounded. People appealed to the highest moral, medical and secular authorities, who all maintained they were in control of the situation, but in fact had little idea how to respond. The trust between government and people was eroded. Once the pestilence arrived, ignorance only added to the horror. People succumbed to fatalism, passivity and despair. The sense grew that no one could escape. The agrarian economy was temporaraily shattered, but out of the calamitous times it was widely hoped that profound change, economic betterment and a fuller understanding of the causes of the disaster would come. For many, though, it was, literally and metaphorically, \"the world upside down\". England in the mid-14th century plague years?

      "body": "<p>The high rim of Kinder Scout and Bleaklow's distant watershed shone brilliant white under Alpine skies soon after St David's Day, and each morning the ponds were sealed under several inches of blue-green ice. </p> <p>Then came a sudden warm blast from the south and the birds went mad at nest-building in the tallest trees. I was reminded of SR Badmin's March Trees, used years ago as a Shell advertisement, with masses of multi-coloured catkins in a white jug on a cottage window-sill as foreground to a riverside scene of naked trees just bursting with pink buds. A proud, mute swan is sailing by, with glimpses of prunus blossom some way off, near cottages and a blunt church spire. </p> <p>When the sun catches tree tops against a busy sky of little clouds on March days, its particular angle seems to possess a magic not present later in spring. The landscape is deserted as footpaths are closed in the wake of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. But there is great promise in the air.

Then came a sudden warm blast from the south and the birds went mad at nest-building in the tallest trees. I was reminded of SR Badmin's March Trees, used years ago as a Shell advertisement, with masses of multi-coloured catkins in a white jug on a cottage window-sill as foreground to a riverside scene of naked trees just bursting with pink buds. A proud, mute swan is sailing by, with glimpses of prunus blossom some way off, near cottages and a blunt church spire. When the sun catches tree tops against a busy sky of little clouds on March days, its particular angle seems to possess a magic not present later in spring. The landscape is deserted as footpaths are closed in the wake of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. But there is great promise in the air. Each morning now the cock chaffinch proclaims his \"little bit of bread and no cheese\" as the sun comes up and I hear the insistent percussion of a busy woodpecker knocking the living daylight out of some unseen trunk down in the wood.

I ask how on earth she manages to edit a film like Satantango, with its succession of extended takes. \"The important thing,\" she says via Tarr, \"is to know where not to cut.\" </p> <p>Tarr and Hranitzky didn't always make films as enigmatic as Satantango. Their early work was hard social realism - working-class vignettes in tight, claustrophobic framings. Tarr never considered himself a political film-maker, he says. \"But I hope we have some social sensibility - and of course, we are always with poor people and ugly people.\" </p> <p>Tarr made his first short film at 16, and directed his first feature, Family Nest, in 1979 - an uncomfortable miniature about a young woman forced to live with her boorish in-laws due to Hungary's extreme housing shortage. The Outsider (1981) was about a young bohemian and his variously boozy and druggy friends. That film, Tarr says, was as much a reaction against the Hungarian cinema of the time as it was against the political system. \"There were a lot of shit things in the cinema, a lot of lies. We weren't knocking at the door, we just beat it down. We were coming with some fresh, new, true, real things. We just wanted to show the reality - anti-movies.\" </p> <p>Tarr and Hranitzky were criticised for making films about characters marginal to the social mainstream. \"We said, for us rich people are marginal.\" They stood their ground against what Tarr calls Hungary's \"soft\" censorship system, but when they ran a studio in the early 1980s with other experimental film-makers, the government closed it down. The official film bodies told them they had no future working in Hungary, and the pair briefly went into a sort of exile in Berlin. </p> <p>After the communist system collapsed, Tarr and Hranitzky were invited home, and at last were able to make Satantango, their long-planned adaptation of a novel by Laszlo Krasznahorkai. By this time, their films had changed radically: everything seemed to take place in a crumbling, depressive world of mud, alcohol and betrayal. The landscapes had become as important as the actors. \"In all our movies,\" Tarr says, \"the location has a face. It looks like an actor.\" </p> <p>Their films had become bigger and slower: \"We wanted to do more poetic things,\" Hranitzky says. \"In the beginning,\" Tarr adds, \"we were just talking about social conflicts, and then we were opening, opening, opening. Now we had to show the landscape and the time.\" Their first landscape film, made on the sly in 1987, was Damnation, written with Krasznahorkai: a noir-ish tale of betrayal in a crumbling mining town. \"When we did location scouting,\" Tarr remembers, \"we kept seeing the cable cars. It was awful weather, we were very poor and just trying to do something, but one thing was sure - the cable cars kept going. The most important part of these movies is mostly the location - you have to go and find the visual elements, something which is real.\" </p> <p>In the intensity of its ritual-like pacing, Satantango is as close as cinema comes to nightmare. It concerns a rural community torn apart by a trickster messiah, but the narrative is less important than the tableaux that compose it - the opening parade of cows, the walk through a storm of detritus, a young girl's torture of her pet cat. That scene, Tarr insists, was done humanely under a vet's supervision, and the cat is healthy and living with him and Hranitzky outside Budapest. The drunk scenes, however, were as realistic as they look - shot, Tarr says, with the entire cast tanked up to the gills. </p> <p>An easier starting point might be Werckmeister Harmonies, with a more surrealistic narrative - involving a circus, a giant whale and a sinister demagogue known as the Prince - that bears comparison with David Lynch's work. The Krasznahorkai novel it is based on, The Melancholy of Resistance, could be read as a parable about political opportunism as a system collapses: written in 1989, it seems remarkably prescient about the post-communist world as a whole. But it is harder to read a clear political meaning into Tarr's film. Hranitzky sees it as closest to The Wizard of Oz. For Tarr, the film was above all about its making, particularly the march through freezing conditions with hordes of extras. \"We never thought about any political connection. The 600 unemployed men are real, in their real clothes, with the real ugliness, and this is the real poverty. Everything was real - it looks like a documentary.\" </p> <p>Tarr may slowly have achieved maestro status on the festival circuit, but that does not make it any easier to get finance. \"When we start a movie,\" he says, \"we always start from zero.\" He and Hranitzky are now planning their next film, a Georges Simenon adaptation, and again the spirit of place is all-important. \" It is set by the seaside, so we have to shoot outside Hungary.\" As usual, location scouting will be painstaking. So far, Tarr has not found a town ugly enough to shoot in. </p> <p>\u0095 Satantango will be shown at the NFT, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), today, followed by Werckmeister Harmonies on Monday and Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>At a Montreal restaurant last October, an unusual party was held to launch a book called Saracen Island: The Poetry of Andreas Karavis. Hosted in part by the press attache of the Greek embassy in Ottawa, the party feted a poet who was not entirely expected to attend. Odder still was the post-party disagreement over whether he had, in fact, shown up. True, a man claiming to be Karavis, and who certainly looked and sounded the part - he muttered in Greek and wore a fisherman's cap - had dropped by briefly. But was he the elusive Cycladic bard, or a mere impostor? For that matter, did Karavis even exist? </p> <p>This latter question had been asked, with mounting interest and perplexity, by many Canadian literati over the previous year. As Matthew Hays, a columnist for the Globe and Mail, posed it in a headline: Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax? </p> <p>The key to this enigma belongs to Karavis's supposed translator and exegete, David Solway. Many observers of the Karavis phenomenon have speculated that Solway, a poet and essayist known for his mischievous nature, invented the Greek poet. It is a charge that the Canadian has denied vehemently - until now. At his home outside Montreal, Solway recently admitted that Karavis is a figment of his imagination. And the man affecting to be Karavis? None other than the Solway family dentist. </p> <p>It all began in October 1999, when the review Books in Canada ran a lavish spread on Karavis, touting him as \"Greece's modern Homer.\" Along with a clutch of poems by Karavis, the review featured a \"rare interview\" with the poet; a snapshot, in which he appeared bearded, capped, and smirking; and a biographical essay by Solway. Karavis was born in 1932 on Crete, Solway wrote, and later moved to Serifos, then Lipsi. Plying his ca\u00efque among the Cyclades, he sold his poems alongside his fish, sometimes even giving them away \"as a bonus with the evening catch\". Eventually his island reputation broadened into a national one, so that today his poems are anthology chestnuts and a staple of school primers. But despite his burden of laurels, Karavis is a retiring and secretive creature. Indeed, it was only after an extensive manhunt that Solway ran the poet to ground in 1991; the two have been fast friends since. </p> <p>Solway confesses that he hoodwinked the editor of Books in Canada, who apparently assumed Karavis was real. But the review's readers were less easily duped. In the following issue, a letter appeared from Fred Reed, a Hellenist translator. Predictably, Reed took issue with Solway, but his line of attack was quite unexpected. </p> <p>Reed disputed neither Karavis's existence nor his excellence; on the contrary, he inflated him to \"a poet of near-mythical dimensions\". Where Reed caviled was over biographical data. Adducing the sleuth work of one Professor CD Candias, Reed made Karavis out to be a decidedly shifty character, one who falsified his ancestry and smuggled cigarettes for a living. And then Reed dropped his bombshell: Karavis's first verses, Candias had discovered, were but \"pirate translations\" of poems by \"the Hydra mafia\", a group of Canadian expatriate writers. Juiciest of all, \"rumour suggests that Karavis may actually have appropriated some of the earlier poetry of David Solway\". </p> <p>Like it or not, Solway had gained a conspirator. Nor was Reed the only one: Yiorgos Chouliaris, the aforementioned press attache, wrote a letter commending Solway for his \"extremely imaginative efforts\" on Karavis's behalf. Why did Chouliaris choose to play along? \"I thought it appropriate,\" he says, \"to honour a Canadian writer who went to such roundabout lengths to validate his lifelong involvement with Greece\". When Solway saw the letter, he contacted Chouliaris, who agreed to help nurture Karavis's burgeoning career. </p> <p>The con quickly acquired a life of its own. Reports circulated that conferences on Karavis were planned at the University of Thessaloniki in Greece and the University of Coimbra in Portugal. At a party, Solway met a writer who opined that Karavis was \"Nobel-isable\". Solway even received, from Greece and in Greek, two postcards from Karavis, the first berating Solway for having disseminated his picture, the second pardoning the lapse. To this day, Solway has no idea who sent the cards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Solway published Saracen Island, of which the following is fairly representative: </p> <p> I remember the wine was </p> <p> sweet </p> <p> and the bread always fresh. </p> <p>We conversed in Lyric, rich </p> <p>and passionate, </p> <p>and the young girls, intact </p> <p>for marriage, </p> <p>blessed their men in every </p> <p> dialect. </p> <p> In the village </p> <p>curling like a sprig of </p> <p>jasmine by the sea </p> <p>it was almost impossible </p> <p>to imagine betrayal: sour </p> <p>wine, stale bread, </p> <p>bad verse, unfaithful wives. </p> <p>Besides producing 80 pages of poetry, Solway had spun out more than 20 of commentary. In his notes, he expertly informs the reader that Karavis abominates Rilke and that \"the tamarisk may be regarded as [his] heraldic tree\". </p> <p>As if that were not enough, Solway also published An Andreas Karavis Companion, a madcap critical apparatus and mishmash of Karavisiana. Here one finds an excerpt from a Lipsi tourist brochure that reads, \"Adding more to the charms of fabuled Lipsi there is existing here the great poet Andreas Karavis\", and an account of a conversation with Karavis about North American and European gender politics, which winds up with Solway producing \"a magazine photo of Andrea Dworkin I keep as a talisman in my wallet\" and with Karavis \"collapsed in a paroxysm of laughter\". </p> <p>But if Solway permits himself a bit of sport, he also takes Karavis seriously. \"I arrived,\" Solway explained in a letter to one publication, \"at a juncture that may be described as both impasse and crossroads ... The tone, stance, and poetic attitudes that had marked my work for a decade were, I felt, exhausted and in need of replacement. Such a 'new' language cannot be summoned by fiat; it must flow from a new set of postulates and a new quality of experience ... So I invented Karavis to serve as alter ego and heteronym, provided him with a life history, and situated him as a sort of renegade and loner in the polemical context of contemporary Greek poetry.\" The term \"heteronym\" ineluctably brings to mind Fernando Pessoa, with whom Solway is pleased to be compared. </p> <p>What he discourages, however, is close analogy between his fabrications and those of mere pranksters. \"Karavis is not a hoax in the usual sense of the term. My intent is not deflationary in the tradition of Harold Stewart and James McCauley's Ern Malley or Kent Johnson's 'Hiroshima poet', Araki Yasusada,\" he said, alluding to an Australian poetry hoax of the mid-1940s and an American one of the 1990s, both of which pointed up the gullibility and aesthetic bankruptcy of the avant-garde. Nor does Solway see himself as the heir of earlier hoaxers such as James Macpherson and Thomas Chatterton. \"I am not interested in perpetuating a deception but in creating a style,\" he explained. As Peter Davison, poetry editor of the Atlantic Monthly - in which Solway, with Davison's informed consent, published a Karavis poem - put it, \"Why is it so important that another name was used? What should matter, it seems to me, is whether the poems contain vitality, identity as poems.\" </p> <p>Still, Solway clearly relishes the practical-joke element of l'affaire Karavis, in no small part because it allows him covertly to tweak his countrymen. \"Canadians are not a very exciting people,\" he says. \"Like rubes at a carnival, they need to be poked, challenged, gulled, bedazzled, so that the collective jaw drops in something other than an insufficiently stifled yawn.\" </p> <p>Solway also derives bittersweet irony from the fact that having published a raft of books in both poetry and prose, he has won Canadian fame only in the guise of a grizzled Greek sea dog. </p> <p>So how persuasive is Karavis? Rachel Hadas, an American poet known for her connections with Greece, finds that: \"Some of the poems are quite good, but many do not seem to me to be extremely plausible as poems translated from Greek.\" Certainly, some Greeks are not amused: In December 1999, To Vima, a major Athens newspaper, sternly upbraided Solway and Reed for having bamboozled Canadian readers, although, bizarrely, the article included a boyhood photo of Karavis. </p> <p>\u00a9 Lingua Franca: The Review of Academic Life. <br><a href=\"http://www.linguafranca.com\">www.linguafranca.com</a></p>",

But was he the elusive Cycladic bard, or a mere impostor? For that matter, did Karavis even exist? This latter question had been asked, with mounting interest and perplexity, by many Canadian literati over the previous year. As Matthew Hays, a columnist for the Globe and Mail, posed it in a headline: Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax? The key to this enigma belongs to Karavis's supposed translator and exegete, David Solway. Many observers of the Karavis phenomenon have speculated that Solway, a poet and essayist known for his mischievous nature, invented the Greek poet. It is a charge that the Canadian has denied vehemently - until now. At his home outside Montreal, Solway recently admitted that Karavis is a figment of his imagination. And the man affecting to be Karavis? None other than the Solway family dentist. It all began in October 1999, when the review Books in Canada ran a lavish spread on Karavis, touting him as \"Greece's modern Homer.\" Along with a clutch of poems by Karavis, the review featured a \"rare interview\" with the poet; a snapshot, in which he appeared bearded, capped, and smirking; and a biographical essay by Solway. Karavis was born in 1932 on Crete, Solway wrote, and later moved to Serifos, then Lipsi. Plying his ca\u00efque among the Cyclades, he sold his poems alongside his fish, sometimes even giving them away \"as a bonus with the evening catch\". Eventually his island reputation broadened into a national one, so that today his poems are anthology chestnuts and a staple of school primers. But despite his burden of laurels, Karavis is a retiring and secretive creature. Indeed, it was only after an extensive manhunt that Solway ran the poet to ground in 1991; the two have been fast friends since. Solway confesses that he hoodwinked the editor of Books in Canada, who apparently assumed Karavis was real. But the review's readers were less easily duped. In the following issue, a letter appeared from Fred Reed, a Hellenist translator. Predictably, Reed took issue with Solway, but his line of attack was quite unexpected. Reed disputed neither Karavis's existence nor his excellence; on the contrary, he inflated him to \"a poet of near-mythical dimensions\". Where Reed caviled was over biographical data. Adducing the sleuth work of one Professor CD Candias, Reed made Karavis out to be a decidedly shifty character, one who falsified his ancestry and smuggled cigarettes for a living. And then Reed dropped his bombshell: Karavis's first verses, Candias had discovered, were but \"pirate translations\" of poems by \"the Hydra mafia\", a group of Canadian expatriate writers. Juiciest of all, \"rumour suggests that Karavis may actually have appropriated some of the earlier poetry of David Solway\". Like it or not, Solway had gained a conspirator. Nor was Reed the only one: Yiorgos Chouliaris, the aforementioned press attache, wrote a letter commending Solway for his \"extremely imaginative efforts\" on Karavis's behalf. Why did Chouliaris choose to play along? \"I thought it appropriate,\" he says, \"to honour a Canadian writer who went to such roundabout lengths to validate his lifelong involvement with Greece\". When Solway saw the letter, he contacted Chouliaris, who agreed to help nurture Karavis's burgeoning career. The con quickly acquired a life of its own. Reports circulated that conferences on Karavis were planned at the University of Thessaloniki in Greece and the University of Coimbra in Portugal. At a party, Solway met a writer who opined that Karavis was \"Nobel-isable\". Solway even received, from Greece and in Greek, two postcards from Karavis, the first berating Solway for having disseminated his picture, the second pardoning the lapse. To this day, Solway has no idea who sent the cards. Meanwhile, Solway published Saracen Island, of which the following is fairly representative: I remember the wine was sweet and the bread always fresh. We conversed in Lyric, rich and passionate, and the young girls, intact for marriage, blessed their men in every dialect. In the village curling like a sprig of jasmine by the sea it was almost impossible to imagine betrayal: sour wine, stale bread, bad verse, unfaithful wives. Besides producing 80 pages of poetry, Solway had spun out more than 20 of commentary. In his notes, he expertly informs the reader that Karavis abominates Rilke and that \"the tamarisk may be regarded as [his] heraldic tree\". As if that were not enough, Solway also published An Andreas Karavis Companion, a madcap critical apparatus and mishmash of Karavisiana. Here one finds an excerpt from a Lipsi tourist brochure that reads, \"Adding more to the charms of fabuled Lipsi there is existing here the great poet Andreas Karavis\", and an account of a conversation with Karavis about North American and European gender politics, which winds up with Solway producing \"a magazine photo of Andrea Dworkin I keep as a talisman in my wallet\" and with Karavis \"collapsed in a paroxysm of laughter\". But if Solway permits himself a bit of sport, he also takes Karavis seriously. \"I arrived,\" Solway explained in a letter to one publication, \"at a juncture that may be described as both impasse and crossroads ... The tone, stance, and poetic attitudes that had marked my work for a decade were, I felt, exhausted and in need of replacement. Such a 'new' language cannot be summoned by fiat; it must flow from a new set of postulates and a new quality of experience ... So I invented Karavis to serve as alter ego and heteronym, provided him with a life history, and situated him as a sort of renegade and loner in the polemical context of contemporary Greek poetry.\" The term \"heteronym\" ineluctably brings to mind Fernando Pessoa, with whom Solway is pleased to be compared. What he discourages, however, is close analogy between his fabrications and those of mere pranksters. \"Karavis is not a hoax in the usual sense of the term. My intent is not deflationary in the tradition of Harold Stewart and James McCauley's Ern Malley or Kent Johnson's 'Hiroshima poet', Araki Yasusada,\" he said, alluding to an Australian poetry hoax of the mid-1940s and an American one of the 1990s, both of which pointed up the gullibility and aesthetic bankruptcy of the avant-garde. Nor does Solway see himself as the heir of earlier hoaxers such as James Macpherson and Thomas Chatterton. \"I am not interested in perpetuating a deception but in creating a style,\" he explained. As Peter Davison, poetry editor of the Atlantic Monthly - in which Solway, with Davison's informed consent, published a Karavis poem - put it, \"Why is it so important that another name was used? What should matter, it seems to me, is whether the poems contain vitality, identity as poems.\" Still, Solway clearly relishes the practical-joke element of l'affaire Karavis, in no small part because it allows him covertly to tweak his countrymen. \"Canadians are not a very exciting people,\" he says. \"Like rubes at a carnival, they need to be poked, challenged, gulled, bedazzled, so that the collective jaw drops in something other than an insufficiently stifled yawn.\" Solway also derives bittersweet irony from the fact that having published a raft of books in both poetry and prose, he has won Canadian fame only in the guise of a grizzled Greek sea dog. So how persuasive is Karavis? Rachel Hadas, an American poet known for her connections with Greece, finds that: \"Some of the poems are quite good, but many do not seem to me to be extremely plausible as poems translated from Greek.\" Certainly, some Greeks are not amused: In December 1999, To Vima, a major Athens newspaper, sternly upbraided Solway and Reed for having bamboozled Canadian readers, although, bizarrely, the article included a boyhood photo of Karavis. \u00a9 Lingua Franca: The Review of Academic Life. www.linguafranca.com",

      "body": "<p>\"Bring me a great actor - don't bring me a Foxrock actor.\" Director Bill Bryden, in Dublin for a new recording of Samuel Beckett's 1956 radio play All That Fall, declared his yardstick for casting. For the assembled actors, there was nothing cryptic about this remark. Geographical identity is measured in spoonfuls in this small island - the suburb of Foxrock being a generic label for snooty Dubliners. It is also the birthplace of Beckett, who did a right job of pooing in its drawing rooms. </p> <p>Bryden listed his impressive catch, among them Anna Manahan, from Waterford, playing Mrs Rooney - flopping \"down flat on the road like a big fat jelly out of a bowl\"; Niall Tobin, from Cork, as blind, querulous Mr Rooney; Dubliners David Kelly and John Kavanagh as Mr Tyler, a retired bill broker and Mr Slocum the racecourse clerk; Belfast's James Ellis as Mr Barrell, the station master; and Dan Colley, a pure county Dubliner, as the boy. </p> <p>Geography is not the only label. James Ellis (remembered in Britain for Z Cars but known in Ireland as both gifted actor and French scholar) brought his Northern shrewdness to bear on the Beckett enigma: \"It's simple. He was a Prod.\" </p> <p>And indeed he was. And so manifestly are most of the play's characters, hovering around Boghill railway station and the nearby racecourse, \"with miles and miles of white rails and three red stands\". We all know now that this is Foxrock station, long departed, and within sprinting distance of Leopardstown racecourse. </p> <p>There has been an unobtrusive transformation in attitudes to Beckett over recent years. Veils have been lifted, cryptic utterances decrypted and riddles deriddled, thanks to the exhaustive (and authorised) work of James Knowlson's biography, Damned to Fame, and a loosening of friendly tongues since Beckett's death in 1989. It has been said that if Estragon and Vladimir had been called Paddy and Sean, great wastelands of intimidation and incomprehension would never have needed to be crossed to enjoy Beckett, and he would not have been kept so long on the solemn, chilled shelves of unintelligibility. There are still plenty of unnamable things in Beckett, but there is no longer any inhibition about the humour. </p> <p>It is now no longer considered naive or simplistic to recognise the Irishness of the settings and mentality of his French plays. Characters and events now virtually flaunt their origins. Nowhere is the identification more precise than in All That Fall. Mrs Rooney, we now know, is based on Beckett's former kindergarten teacher, Ida Elsner; Foxrock's non-fictional station master was called Farrell, only casually disguised here as Mr Barrell; Mr Slocum (a pun) was the maiden name of Beckett's cousin's wife; and Miss Fitt (another joke) was based on a very proper lady from Rathgar, once a posh Dublin suburb. The character selling pig dung from a cart was familiar in Foxrock, as was Connolly's van; there was even a real local preacher named Hardy. </p> <p>Bill Bryden's cast went through the usual routine of settling down to work: stories about Brendan Behan; imitations of Orson Welles at Dublin's Gate theatre; anecdotes about Michael Macliammoir, for 40 years Dublin's fruitiest actor and Gaelic scholar who, after his death, was unmasked as an Englishman. \"There's an awful lot of lights under an awful lot of bushels in this room,\" Bryden whispered to me. </p> <p>Although during a quarter of a century Bryden has done Shakespeare, Synge, Chekhov, Pirandello and Mamet, he has never worked on Beckett before. \"Just happenstance,\" he says. \"You have got to love the play so much you don't have to respect it any more. There has been too much reverence around the shrine of Samuel Beckett.\" (It has to be said, though, that Bryden's punctilious direction of word, rhythm and pause did not suggest any lack of respect.) </p> <p>Manahan has been a stalwart of Irish theatre since the late 1950s, and her career has taken off again in recent years (she won a Tony three years ago for her performance on Broadway in The Beauty Queen of Leenane), and she has much the same attitude. \"Some actors made him a holy of holies,\" she says. \"To tell you the truth, he never really attracted me before. I was offered Happy Days in Edinburgh once but I was not truly a fan of his.

      "bodyText": "\"Bring me a great actor - don't bring me a Foxrock actor.\" Director Bill Bryden, in Dublin for a new recording of Samuel Beckett's 1956 radio play All That Fall, declared his yardstick for casting. For the assembled actors, there was nothing cryptic about this remark. Geographical identity is measured in spoonfuls in this small island - the suburb of Foxrock being a generic label for snooty Dubliners. It is also the birthplace of Beckett, who did a right job of pooing in its drawing rooms. Bryden listed his impressive catch, among them Anna Manahan, from Waterford, playing Mrs Rooney - flopping \"down flat on the road like a big fat jelly out of a bowl\"; Niall Tobin, from Cork, as blind, querulous Mr Rooney; Dubliners David Kelly and John Kavanagh as Mr Tyler, a retired bill broker and Mr Slocum the racecourse clerk; Belfast's James Ellis as Mr Barrell, the station master; and Dan Colley, a pure county Dubliner, as the boy. Geography is not the only label. James Ellis (remembered in Britain for Z Cars but known in Ireland as both gifted actor and French scholar) brought his Northern shrewdness to bear on the Beckett enigma: \"It's simple. He was a Prod.\" And indeed he was. And so manifestly are most of the play's characters, hovering around Boghill railway station and the nearby racecourse, \"with miles and miles of white rails and three red stands\". We all know now that this is Foxrock station, long departed, and within sprinting distance of Leopardstown racecourse. There has been an unobtrusive transformation in attitudes to Beckett over recent years. Veils have been lifted, cryptic utterances decrypted and riddles deriddled, thanks to the exhaustive (and authorised) work of James Knowlson's biography, Damned to Fame, and a loosening of friendly tongues since Beckett's death in 1989. It has been said that if Estragon and Vladimir had been called Paddy and Sean, great wastelands of intimidation and incomprehension would never have needed to be crossed to enjoy Beckett, and he would not have been kept so long on the solemn, chilled shelves of unintelligibility. There are still plenty of unnamable things in Beckett, but there is no longer any inhibition about the humour. It is now no longer considered naive or simplistic to recognise the Irishness of the settings and mentality of his French plays. Characters and events now virtually flaunt their origins. Nowhere is the identification more precise than in All That Fall. Mrs Rooney, we now know, is based on Beckett's former kindergarten teacher, Ida Elsner; Foxrock's non-fictional station master was called Farrell, only casually disguised here as Mr Barrell; Mr Slocum (a pun) was the maiden name of Beckett's cousin's wife; and Miss Fitt (another joke) was based on a very proper lady from Rathgar, once a posh Dublin suburb. The character selling pig dung from a cart was familiar in Foxrock, as was Connolly's van; there was even a real local preacher named Hardy. Bill Bryden's cast went through the usual routine of settling down to work: stories about Brendan Behan; imitations of Orson Welles at Dublin's Gate theatre; anecdotes about Michael Macliammoir, for 40 years Dublin's fruitiest actor and Gaelic scholar who, after his death, was unmasked as an Englishman. \"There's an awful lot of lights under an awful lot of bushels in this room,\" Bryden whispered to me. Although during a quarter of a century Bryden has done Shakespeare, Synge, Chekhov, Pirandello and Mamet, he has never worked on Beckett before. \"Just happenstance,\" he says. \"You have got to love the play so much you don't have to respect it any more. There has been too much reverence around the shrine of Samuel Beckett.\" (It has to be said, though, that Bryden's punctilious direction of word, rhythm and pause did not suggest any lack of respect.) Manahan has been a stalwart of Irish theatre since the late 1950s, and her career has taken off again in recent years (she won a Tony three years ago for her performance on Broadway in The Beauty Queen of Leenane), and she has much the same attitude. \"Some actors made him a holy of holies,\" she says. \"To tell you the truth, he never really attracted me before. I was offered Happy Days in Edinburgh once but I was not truly a fan of his. As a matter of fact, I tried to avoid Beckett, but he got me in the end.\" Irish actors enjoy theorising about \"Sam's\" work in an entirely laid-back manner.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, Howard Hodgkin was on holiday in Italy with the novelist Julian Barnes and Barnes's wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh. While in the small town of Taranto, Hodgkin decided he wanted to buy a black towel and happened to see one in a shop window. \"So we all went in and they brought out a black towel,\" recalls Barnes. \"'No, that's not black,' said Howard. So they brought out another, and another, and he said, 'No, I want one like the one in the window'. They eventually emptied the entire shop and were reduced to delving in the window. And that towel was indeed true black, when set beside the others. You know intellectually that painters have a more highly developed sense of colour, but this was a brilliant and unwitting public demonstration.\" </p> <p>Now aged 68, Hodgkin has been in the first division of living artists for a quarter of a century. He is a Turner Prize winner, has been knighted, and enjoys a reputation which is just as strong abroad, particularly in America, as it is at home. But while it is perhaps no real surprise that a man who is routinely described as Britain's greatest colourist should be able to differentiate between shades of black, Hodgkin's precise daily calibration of the visual world still remains exceptional. </p> <p>He was once invited to a performance of Wagner's opera, Siegfried, by his friend, the soprano Anne Evans. Although Evans only sings in the last act, Hodgkin walked out of the theatre after just a few minutes because he found the production so visually offensive. (\"It was just a few twigs sticking out of sand, which was totally inadequate,\" he explains. \"But I did go back in at the end to hear Anne sing.\") On several occasions he has changed dealers because the rooms in which they displayed his work weren't acceptable, and on a more mundane level he sometimes has to move tables in a restaurant two or three times if he can see his own reflection anywhere in a mirror. </p> <p>All this, as well as his extraordinary eye as a collector of Indian art, undoubtedly ensures Hodgkin's place as one of the great aesthetes of the age. But to think of him as a delicate creature cruelly buffeted by the coarseness of modern life would be misleading. Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate Gallery, curated Hodgkin's first museum exhibition in 1976. He says: \"You wouldn't use the word sensitive about Howard; that implies something far too ineffectual. He is more passionate than that. He is a man who loves and hates with a passion, and is very emotional. He will cry very easily and flares up, both in terms of colour and of temper, very quickly. That can be quite disturbing and it is sometimes quite difficult to deal with. But it is because he holds his convictions so strongly. And that passion has become much more evident in the paintings over the last 15 years or so.\" </p> <p>Hodgkin's lusciously colourful paintings, although often quite small at just a few feet each way, are comprised of full-brushed medleys of boldly recorded dots, slashes, curves and other grand sweeps. He always paints on board, not canvas, with the picture spreading over the frame. Both board and frame are as often as not bought at car boot sales. The pictures can take years to complete, with him continually adding more marks which, he says, \"may look like free gestures, but very rarely are\". His work is often mistakenly seen as abstract, but as Hodgkin has explained, he is, \"a representational painter, but not a painter of appearances. I paint representational pictures of emotional situations.\" </p> <p>In his monograph of the artist - revised and reissued next month - the critic Andrew Graham-Dixon illustrates the difficulty of this apparently straightforward statement. \"Howard Hodgkin paints emotional situations, Cezanne painted apples.\" With reference to the late-80s painting, On the Riviera, Graham-Dixon describes Hodgkin's conception of his memory of these emotional situations: \"something illogical, subject to the vagaries of feeling and attention - pushed, as it so often is, in Hodgkin's mature art to the extremes of near-illegibility. Remembered things (flags, sea and sky, perhaps the whitewashed side of a building) merge and blend, melt into each other like the elements of a collage that have been liquefied. The painting phrases itself boldly as a surrogate for an experience that cannot be recaptured, and creates a new world out of the chaos of a memory.\" </p> <p>A painting is finished when it \"replaces\" the event or emotion that inspired it. \"The picture is instead of what happened,\" Hodgkin once explained to the critic Robert Hughes. \"We don't need to know the story: generally, the story's trivial anyway. The more people want to know the story, the less they'll want to look at the picture.\" Hughes has described Hodgkin' s work as, \"feelings declared in colour. They are intelligent not in the way argument can be, but in the way painting is - though in most cutting-edge art, actually isn't.\" </p> <p>Julian Barnes - who says he likes to maintain that the green patch in the middle of the painting, When Did We Go To Morocco? (1988-93), is in fact him behind the Michelin guide - has witnessed the moment of artistic conception. \"We'll all be sitting in a cafe in a ruminative mood and I might say, semi-teasingly, 'I think I feel a picture coming on,' and Howard might chuckle, 'I think I feel one too'. There's no evident frisson. You have a sense of him sitting a little further back in his chair, of his head tilting slightly upwards, hoovering in the entire scene of a small Italian piazza or a fishmarket. Although, of course, his final representation of it will be at several visual removes.\" </p> <p>This process might have made Hodgkin an exception as someone in the British art world that the public has heard of, but looking at his family background, high-profile achievement seems much closer to the norm. On his father's side of the family tree are the 19th-century physician, Thomas Hodgkin, after whom the lymphatic cancer is named; Dorothy, who is a Hodgkin by marriage, and was awarded the 1964 Nobel prize for chemistry for her work on the structure of Vitamin B12; and the Bloomsbury artist and critic, Roger Fry. On the maternal side, his grandfather, Gordon Hewart, was a Lord Chief Justice. </p> <p>Howard was born in Hammersmith in 1932 and has one sister, Ann, two years older than him, who is now retired, having been a school secretary. His father, Eliot, was a manager for ICI, and his mother, Katherine, a housewife. There was a certain amount of casual exposure to art during his childhood, with one family friend keeping an Epstein bust in their chicken run. The house of his cousin, Margery Fry, was full of items from the Omega Workshop, the applied arts company founded by Roger Fry, which produced ceramics, furniture and textiles designed by Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. </p> <p>Hodgkin describes his own family unit as \"middle-class but bizarre\", and says that there were social tensions. While his grandfather, the Lord Chief Justice, ended up as a friend of Lloyd George, he was a self-made man whose own mother had run a draper's shop in Bury. His grandfather \"loathed\" his father, having hoped that his daughter would have made a better match. But while his father was financially compelled to work for ICI in order to support his family, his life was not without a hinterland. During the war, he ended up working for a unit that broadcast black propaganda on the radio to break German morale. As part of the first wave of allied forces who entered Paris after the liberation, he brought back books on Bonnard and, as a noted amateur horticulturist, he advised the government on the planting of motorway verges. </p> <p>\"When he was dying, he was given a wonderful art nouveau gold medal by the Royal Horticultural Society,\" says Hodgkin. \"My father really wanted to have a creative life of some kind, and he loved looking at paintings. Although my mother was a very good botanical illustrator, painting didn't really mean anything to her.\" His parents did buy one of Hodgkin's paintings from his third exhibition in 1967. \"But eventually, my father said that he couldn't possibly hang it up in the house. And he was quite right. It was a brown furniture sort of house, and there was just nowhere for it to go. Eventually, they gave it to the Tate.\" </p> <p>In 1940, Howard, his sister and his mother moved to the United States to get away from the war. They stayed with a lawyer friend of his grandfather in Long Island, which Hodgkin remembers as being like, \"something out of the Great Gatsby\". Having declared his intention to be an artist at the age of five, he was repeatedly taken to the Museum of Modern Art and was doubly precocious in that he could not only draw, but could also discuss art. </p> <p>Hodgkin says the family response to his ambition was that it was all right to be an artist as long as it was as an amateur. This stance led to a battle throughout his childhood as to what sort of education he should have. With money left by Hewart, he was sent to a series of expensive schools, including Eton, where he was taught by Wilfred Blunt, brother of the art historian and spy, Anthony. To this day, he has mixed feelings about the place, and still gets angry when the school is characterised as a snobbish enclave. </p> <p>\"These people don't know what they are talking about. I think the school was a university for children. You were given freedom and encouragement, and you were made responsible.\" However, as all his judgments were filtered through the calculation \"will this help or hinder me to be an artist?\", he reasoned that it wasn't for him. </p> <p>He says that it was his mother who continued to push the square peg back into the round hole in terms of persevering with an orthodox, privileged education. \"I didn't get on with my mother,\" he acknowledges. \"She even wanted me to join the diplomatic corps. I told her it was ridiculous - I would have started a war.\" </p> <p>It was partly with the help of his cousin, Margery Fry, that when Hodgkin left school in 1949 he won a place at Camberwell Art School, and then moved on to the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham. At Camberwell, he was taught by leading Euston Road School painters Victor Pasmore and William Coldstream, and remembers considerable peer pressure to conform to a house style. \"I was already an outsider even then,\" he recalls, and by the time he went to Corsham, he already had his own artistic language. </p> <p>Hodgkin appears happy to be thought of as a one-off, but there have been attempts to place him within a tradition. One of the more interesting sees him as following on from Ivon Hitchens, whose vividly colourful depictions of the English landscape from the 40s to the 70s hover between abstraction and figuration. Richard Shone of the Burlington magazine says that while Hodgkin has developed his own very personal synthesis of various artistic traditions, \"all young artists take on an aspect of their time. You can't come out of nowhere, and certainly in his early work with the bright, frontal colour and the relaxed young people sit ting in rooms, there are aspects of pop art with a small p.\" Hodgkin says that he was very proud to once appear in the index of a book on pop art under the entry: \"Howard Hodgkin is not a pop artist.\" </p> <p>The critic David Sylvester sees a longer heritage. \"There is an atmospheric lyricism in his work that is very English and can be traced back to Turner. I think Howard is steeped in Turner.\" Hodgkin has spoken about the importance of Matisse and the Intimist work of the French painter Edouard Vuillard, but says that as a young artist, the key exhibitions he saw in London were of contemporary American art put on by the United States Information Service. He was struck by the work of Barnett Newman and Stuart Davis, but the most influential was Jackson Pollock. \"Seeing the Pollocks was amazing for an ambitious young artist. They were there as, say, mountains outside your holiday window are there. They became part of my world, and that was a revelation. Seeing work like that can give you a new idea as to what is physically possible. It's not so much the content of the picture, but just the thought that, 'yes, that can be done'. It is often forgotten that paintings are what they are made of. Painting is a very physical thing.\" </p> <p>After finishing as a student in 1954, Hodgkin spent a brief period teaching at Charterhouse School, and then returned to Bath as a teacher, where he stayed until 1966. After that, he taught for six years at the Chelsea School of Art. He says he enjoyed teaching, but of most benefit to him was mixing with other artist-teachers. The artist, Robyn Denny, who was both a colleague and subject of two well-known Hodgkin portraits, remembers him as very ambitious as an artist. \"He was extremely clever, but not in a pejorative sense. He was complicated, learned, insightful and sort of duplicit and opaque. It is an odd combination that makes him an extremely interesting man. And combined with his ambition as an artist, it made him a powerful force.\" </p> <p>Chris Garrett, the cartoonist, and half of the Guardian's Biff cartoon team, was one of Hodgkin's students. He says Hodgkin was more like a dance teacher in that he always demanded the best. \"He scared the living daylights out of us. He'd set an exercise and then walk round the studio. You'd hear him saying, 'that's terrible, rub it out', and then a whimper from the student. 'Stop trying to look like an artist, just be one'.\" Garrett adds: \"Maybe in the third year he'd offer you a Woodbine, which was a sign something was good. He was difficult to fathom. He always wore a dark suit and tie and had this very austere, punctilious way of teaching. But his paintings were packed with these great bloody colours blasted on the canvas, which had been the product of an obviously very intense kind of operation. I once saw him in his suit, and there was a tiny spot of brilliant viridian green on his black Oxford shoes. It was the only hint of what he had been doing.\" </p> <p>By this time Hodgkin was married with a young family. He and Julia Lane met as art students at Corsham and they married in 1955. She went on to teach art in a school, and then to run the florist shop at Heal's furniture shop in London. Hodgkin commuted to Bath from their flat in Shepherds Bush, where he remembers holes in the carpets were covered with dog skins - \"a little Scottie here, something else there. It was revolting, and we got rid of them in the end.\" </p> <p>Their first son, Louis, was born in 1958, and then Sam in 1960. \"Louis lives in the country and cultivates his garden,\" says Hodgkin. \"I don't know how he gets by but he is completely happy. People go and see him because he's so happy. He's like a guru or something. Sam, on the other hand, is not so happy.\" He laughs. \"He works in television.\" </p> <p>Hodgkin was not very productive when his children were young. \"Julia once asked me how can I call myself a painter when I don't actually paint. It wasn't so neat that I started to paint immediately, but I was upset by it and it struck home.\" This tentativeness was reflected in his business relationship with dealers. When the Arthur Tooth gallery in Dover Street put on his first show in 1962, they offered him a contract that would double every year. \"But I insisted it stayed the same,\" says Hodgkin. \"I always worried where the next picture was coming from and it would have been too much pressure. Little did I know what was to come in terms of pressure.\" </p> <p>As well as teaching and being an artist during the 60s, Hodgkin became a serious collector of 16th and 17th-century Indian painting. His collection became one of the best in the world, and has been widely exhibited. \"For a while it was a wonderful other activity,\" he says. \"It was nice to meet other collectors, and I was good at it. But the collection becomes a monster with a life of its own. You have to have things to go with other things. It probably has affected me as an artist, but not in the way that people think. The Indian paintings haven't influenced my paintings, but collecting has made me very aware of quality, and increasingly demanding of my own work.\" </p> <p>Such was Hodgkin's commitment to his collection that he once sold 60 of his own paintings - \"not for huge amounts of money\" - to fund the purchase of one Indian work. His friend, James Fenton, the poet and writer on art and gardening, says that is the essence of a collector. \"It's more than being an accumulator. The important expression is 'the best is the enemy of the good'. If you have good things in the collection, and then you get something that is the best, the other paintings somehow have their noses put out of joint. I told him once that something was coming up for sale and it looked to be a bargain. He said this whole business of bargains is a diversion. 'Don't collect bargains, collect masterpieces.' That is Howard.\" </p> <p>Julian Barnes says Hodgkin's astonishing eye for quality means he can visually gut a municipal art gallery in eight to 10 minutes. \"And he would have seen, and more importantly remembered in incredible detail, the things that qualify as masterpieces. It's an extraordinary experience going round a church or a gallery with Howard. Typically, we'd be in a church with, say, a one-star Bellini altar piece in the second chapel on the left. We'd get there and there would be a deep, dark chuckle from Howard - 'I think not'. And then within 20 seconds he'll locate a small piece of baroque carving at the bottom of a tomb which was in fact the only thing worth seeing in the church.\" </p> <p>While there has not been a school of Hodgkin, his influence on the British art scene has been considerable. His reputation abroad has bolstered the image of British art, and his collection is significant, but equally important was his work as an artist trustee of both the Tate and the National in the 60s and 70s. In her history of the Tate gallery, Frances Spalding identified his importance in relation to purchases made by the national collections. \"With his immense knowledge of art and the art market, Hodgkin had a unique gift for either promoting or killing a potential purchase,\" she wrote. \"He might merely lower his eyes and begin to doodle, but it had devastating effect.\" </p> <p>Hodgkin has said he was amazed at how much clout the artist trustees had, and was instrumental in buying important work by Picasso, Matisse and Degas. He also paved the way for more radical purchases, recalling that, \"work by the likes of Beuys had only just come in and no one quite knew what to do with them. They just didn't quite know how to deal with a work that was made of felt and fat.\" </p> <p>Although always seen as ambitious, and a skilled operator in the art world, it took a long time for Hodgkin to break through as a first-rank artist. He was 45 before he had a major show in New York, and 52 when he finally won world-wide acclaim after representing Britain at the Venice Biennale. It is generally accepted that at some time in the mid-70s his work seemed to move up a gear. There is a neat psycho-sexual explanation, which was first posited by his friend, Bruce Chatwin. Howard had, \"a newfound engagement with the erotic\", Chatwin coyly wrote. It had led to a \"new persona\". What Chatwin meant was that Hodgkin's marriage had come to an end - although he and Julia have never divorced - and he was living as a gay man. Chatwin excitedly, and hyperbolically, wrote to a friend in 1977 that Howard's had become, \"the most publicised private life of the century\". In reality, it was a rather more smooth transition, and he has now been in a relationship with the music writer, Antony Peattie, since 1983. </p> <p>Hodgkin sees less of a clean break in his life than is popularly portrayed, pointing out a continuity in his art. \"The early pictures are to some degree a rehearsal for what was to come. The continuum might be a bit bumpy, but that's not for the obvious reasons everyone always talks about,\" he says. \"I had terrible trouble finding a way of painting. To some extent, I found my voice early and knew what I wanted to do. But learning how to do it took longer. Nothing is so simple as 'he's gay, look how the pictures have changed'. It just doesn't work like that. The processes are still going on.\" </p> <p>David Sylvester agrees that Hodgkin, \"has a more consistent line of development than you see in most artists. He found himself fairly early and remained himself.\" The critical consensus is that his work has improved over time, but some observers still prefer the much more schematic and hard-edged early work when his portraits, although his subjects never sat for him, still contained more conventional representations of identifiable people. </p> <p>Robyn Denny claims: \"His later work seems to coast with less tautness and greater serenity than before. It seems to lack the rawness, the rough edge, the sense of fear that permeated his earlier work and made it always surprising and remarkable.\" But the more orthodox view comes from Nicholas Serota. \"There is a consistent artist and a consistent eye there, but his work did become bolder and freer. His colours had always been very intense and hot, but they became much more complex. They were never beautiful paintings early on, they were regarded as being slightly awkward. They are not awkward in the same way now. They have an elegance and a beauty.\" </p> <p>It seems difficult to envisage now, but in 1976, when Serota was putting together the Hodgkin exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, not only was it a struggle to get hold of Hodgkin's paintings from the private collectors who owned them, but even getting photographs of some of the works was impossible. However, within a few years Hodgkin was an art superstar. In 1984, he was expected to win the inaugural Turner prize. In fact, it was awarded to Malcolm Morley, and David Sylvester recalls that, although Hodgkin was clearly disappointed, \"he came to a dinner with Morley afterwards and was very graceful in defeat\". He won it the following year. He was awarded a CBE in 1977, and knighted in 1992. Did the long wait make him any better equipped to handle success when it arrived? \"Not really. I find it terribly difficult to believe in. I've retrospectively regretted the knighthood,\" he says. \"I try hard to get it chopped off whenever I can.\" </p> <p>His success has had a dramatic impact on the price of his work. Two years ago, Christie's sold one of his paintings for a record $672,000. An astonishing change since Chris Garrett balked at paying \u00a375 for a painting from Hodgkin's second Tooth show in 1964. While the work has also been seen in more accessible formats - he has designed stamps, book jackets, ballet sets and the exterior of the Imax cinema in London - he has been criticised for producing work that can amount to pretty things for rich people. </p> <p>Richard Shone says: \"There are a series of middle-aged white male critics who think that someone who paints attractively and sensitively can't possibly be any good. Then they get hold of the fact that he's from a well-known family and that he is well to do - from his art - and it all counts against him. But he doesn't produce luxury goods. His paintings come out of him through blood, sweat and tears.\" </p> <p>The critic, Waldemar Januszczak, went on the attack after seeing the first painting on display at a show in 1999 which Hodgkin had, \"the temerity to entitle After Matisse. What! When did Matisse ever use a brush wide enough to sweep a station concourse? Hodgkin is not the English Matisse. Rather, with his increasing sentimentality, his cheerful colours, his obvious plotlines, he is the Walt Disney of British abstraction.\" </p> <p>Hodgkin says: \"There is an idea that if a subject is not grandiose and tragic, then it is trivial. Just imagine if Matisse had made today his famous remark about wanting to paint pictures that were like comfortable armchairs for tired business men to sit in. That would be the end of him.\" </p> <p>Hodgkin's next exhibition of new work opens in Milan later this week, and in June some of his older work will be hung alongside the old masters at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Seeing the 17 oils for Milan against the whitewashed walls of his studio, a converted dairy round the corner from the British Museum, they are like a series of dazzling jewels that strangely transfix and draw in the exhilarated viewer. Julian Barnes sums up the powerful ongoing relationships the paintings can engender. \"On a first visit to a Hodgkin exhibition of 12 paintings you'll think there are three obvious masterpieces, six or seven very good pictures, and two that you just don't get. But if you go back, you find they all get hold of you and they never let go. So when you see a painting again after several years, it's much more than just an aesthetic reconnection: it's also a direct, emotional response, like meeting a person again.\" </p> <p>This chimes with Hodgkin's own long-term relationship with the works. He says the emotion that sparked their creation is left in the work by the time it has been completed. \"I remember seeing a picture of mine that I hadn't seen for a very long time, and thinking: 'ah, yes.' It was an instant recognition of that time.\" He now says he has many things in his mind, \"queuing up to be turned into something else\", and is increasingly anxious to complete the process. \"I can't think of anything rational that allows things to get to the front of the queue and be painted; perhaps an echo of something that happened now and also happened then. But now I do feel that time is creeping up on me and I've got to hurry up. I don't care a damn about what happens when I'm dead, but I do have a sense of increased urgency. And I think it's made me more courageous.\"</p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong>6 August 1932, London </p> <p><strong>Education: </strong>Schools include St Andrew's, Pangbourne, Eton, Bryanston; Camberwell School of Art 1949-50; Bath Academy of Art 1950-54 </p> <p><strong>Family: </strong>Married Julia Lane, 1955; two sons, Louis and Sam </p> <p><strong>Posts held: </strong>Trustee of Tate Gallery 1970-76; Trustee of National Gallery 1978-85; Committee of National Art Collections Fund 1989 </p> <p><strong>Some exhibitions: </strong>Arthur Tooth, London 1962, 1964, 1967; Kornblee Gallery, New York 1973; Museum of Modern Art, Oxford 1976; Knoedler &amp; Company, New York 1981; Venice Biennale 1984; Whitechapel Gallery 1985; Fort Worth, Texas 1995; Hayward Gallery 1997 </p> <p><strong>Prizes: </strong>Turner Prize 1985 </p> <p><strong>Honours: </strong>CBE 1977; Knighthood 1992; Hon D Litt London 1985; Honorary fellow London Institute 1999; Hon D.Litt Oxford 2000 </p> <p>\u0095 The catalogue of the show at Galleria Lawrence Rubin in Milan - 29 March to 4 May - is available from the Tate Modern bookshop at \u00a318, tel: 020-7401 6167.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, Howard Hodgkin was on holiday in Italy with the novelist Julian Barnes and Barnes's wife, the literary agent Pat Kavanagh. While in the small town of Taranto, Hodgkin decided he wanted to buy a black towel and happened to see one in a shop window. \"So we all went in and they brought out a black towel,\" recalls Barnes. \"'No, that's not black,' said Howard. So they brought out another, and another, and he said, 'No, I want one like the one in the window'. They eventually emptied the entire shop and were reduced to delving in the window. And that towel was indeed true black, when set beside the others. You know intellectually that painters have a more highly developed sense of colour, but this was a brilliant and unwitting public demonstration.\" Now aged 68, Hodgkin has been in the first division of living artists for a quarter of a century. He is a Turner Prize winner, has been knighted, and enjoys a reputation which is just as strong abroad, particularly in America, as it is at home. But while it is perhaps no real surprise that a man who is routinely described as Britain's greatest colourist should be able to differentiate between shades of black, Hodgkin's precise daily calibration of the visual world still remains exceptional. He was once invited to a performance of Wagner's opera, Siegfried, by his friend, the soprano Anne Evans. Although Evans only sings in the last act, Hodgkin walked out of the theatre after just a few minutes because he found the production so visually offensive. (\"It was just a few twigs sticking out of sand, which was totally inadequate,\" he explains. \"But I did go back in at the end to hear Anne sing.\") On several occasions he has changed dealers because the rooms in which they displayed his work weren't acceptable, and on a more mundane level he sometimes has to move tables in a restaurant two or three times if he can see his own reflection anywhere in a mirror. All this, as well as his extraordinary eye as a collector of Indian art, undoubtedly ensures Hodgkin's place as one of the great aesthetes of the age. But to think of him as a delicate creature cruelly buffeted by the coarseness of modern life would be misleading. Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate Gallery, curated Hodgkin's first museum exhibition in 1976. He says: \"You wouldn't use the word sensitive about Howard; that implies something far too ineffectual. He is more passionate than that. He is a man who loves and hates with a passion, and is very emotional. He will cry very easily and flares up, both in terms of colour and of temper, very quickly. That can be quite disturbing and it is sometimes quite difficult to deal with. But it is because he holds his convictions so strongly. And that passion has become much more evident in the paintings over the last 15 years or so.\" Hodgkin's lusciously colourful paintings, although often quite small at just a few feet each way, are comprised of full-brushed medleys of boldly recorded dots, slashes, curves and other grand sweeps. He always paints on board, not canvas, with the picture spreading over the frame. Both board and frame are as often as not bought at car boot sales. The pictures can take years to complete, with him continually adding more marks which, he says, \"may look like free gestures, but very rarely are\". His work is often mistakenly seen as abstract, but as Hodgkin has explained, he is, \"a representational painter, but not a painter of appearances. I paint representational pictures of emotional situations.\" In his monograph of the artist - revised and reissued next month - the critic Andrew Graham-Dixon illustrates the difficulty of this apparently straightforward statement. \"Howard Hodgkin paints emotional situations, Cezanne painted apples.\" With reference to the late-80s painting, On the Riviera, Graham-Dixon describes Hodgkin's conception of his memory of these emotional situations: \"something illogical, subject to the vagaries of feeling and attention - pushed, as it so often is, in Hodgkin's mature art to the extremes of near-illegibility. Remembered things (flags, sea and sky, perhaps the whitewashed side of a building) merge and blend, melt into each other like the elements of a collage that have been liquefied. The painting phrases itself boldly as a surrogate for an experience that cannot be recaptured, and creates a new world out of the chaos of a memory.\" A painting is finished when it \"replaces\" the event or emotion that inspired it. \"The picture is instead of what happened,\" Hodgkin once explained to the critic Robert Hughes. \"We don't need to know the story: generally, the story's trivial anyway. The more people want to know the story, the less they'll want to look at the picture.\" Hughes has described Hodgkin' s work as, \"feelings declared in colour. They are intelligent not in the way argument can be, but in the way painting is - though in most cutting-edge art, actually isn't.\" Julian Barnes - who says he likes to maintain that the green patch in the middle of the painting, When Did We Go To Morocco? (1988-93), is in fact him behind the Michelin guide - has witnessed the moment of artistic conception. \"We'll all be sitting in a cafe in a ruminative mood and I might say, semi-teasingly, 'I think I feel a picture coming on,' and Howard might chuckle, 'I think I feel one too'. There's no evident frisson. You have a sense of him sitting a little further back in his chair, of his head tilting slightly upwards, hoovering in the entire scene of a small Italian piazza or a fishmarket. Although, of course, his final representation of it will be at several visual removes.\" This process might have made Hodgkin an exception as someone in the British art world that the public has heard of, but looking at his family background, high-profile achievement seems much closer to the norm. On his father's side of the family tree are the 19th-century physician, Thomas Hodgkin, after whom the lymphatic cancer is named; Dorothy, who is a Hodgkin by marriage, and was awarded the 1964 Nobel prize for chemistry for her work on the structure of Vitamin B12; and the Bloomsbury artist and critic, Roger Fry. On the maternal side, his grandfather, Gordon Hewart, was a Lord Chief Justice. Howard was born in Hammersmith in 1932 and has one sister, Ann, two years older than him, who is now retired, having been a school secretary. His father, Eliot, was a manager for ICI, and his mother, Katherine, a housewife. There was a certain amount of casual exposure to art during his childhood, with one family friend keeping an Epstein bust in their chicken run. The house of his cousin, Margery Fry, was full of items from the Omega Workshop, the applied arts company founded by Roger Fry, which produced ceramics, furniture and textiles designed by Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Hodgkin describes his own family unit as \"middle-class but bizarre\", and says that there were social tensions. While his grandfather, the Lord Chief Justice, ended up as a friend of Lloyd George, he was a self-made man whose own mother had run a draper's shop in Bury. His grandfather \"loathed\" his father, having hoped that his daughter would have made a better match. But while his father was financially compelled to work for ICI in order to support his family, his life was not without a hinterland. During the war, he ended up working for a unit that broadcast black propaganda on the radio to break German morale. As part of the first wave of allied forces who entered Paris after the liberation, he brought back books on Bonnard and, as a noted amateur horticulturist, he advised the government on the planting of motorway verges. \"When he was dying, he was given a wonderful art nouveau gold medal by the Royal Horticultural Society,\" says Hodgkin. \"My father really wanted to have a creative life of some kind, and he loved looking at paintings. Although my mother was a very good botanical illustrator, painting didn't really mean anything to her.\" His parents did buy one of Hodgkin's paintings from his third exhibition in 1967. \"But eventually, my father said that he couldn't possibly hang it up in the house. And he was quite right. It was a brown furniture sort of house, and there was just nowhere for it to go. Eventually, they gave it to the Tate.\" In 1940, Howard, his sister and his mother moved to the United States to get away from the war. They stayed with a lawyer friend of his grandfather in Long Island, which Hodgkin remembers as being like, \"something out of the Great Gatsby\". Having declared his intention to be an artist at the age of five, he was repeatedly taken to the Museum of Modern Art and was doubly precocious in that he could not only draw, but could also discuss art. Hodgkin says the family response to his ambition was that it was all right to be an artist as long as it was as an amateur. This stance led to a battle throughout his childhood as to what sort of education he should have. With money left by Hewart, he was sent to a series of expensive schools, including Eton, where he was taught by Wilfred Blunt, brother of the art historian and spy, Anthony. To this day, he has mixed feelings about the place, and still gets angry when the school is characterised as a snobbish enclave. \"These people don't know what they are talking about. I think the school was a university for children. You were given freedom and encouragement, and you were made responsible.\" However, as all his judgments were filtered through the calculation \"will this help or hinder me to be an artist?\", he reasoned that it wasn't for him. He says that it was his mother who continued to push the square peg back into the round hole in terms of persevering with an orthodox, privileged education. \"I didn't get on with my mother,\" he acknowledges. \"She even wanted me to join the diplomatic corps. I told her it was ridiculous - I would have started a war.\" It was partly with the help of his cousin, Margery Fry, that when Hodgkin left school in 1949 he won a place at Camberwell Art School, and then moved on to the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham. At Camberwell, he was taught by leading Euston Road School painters Victor Pasmore and William Coldstream, and remembers considerable peer pressure to conform to a house style. \"I was already an outsider even then,\" he recalls, and by the time he went to Corsham, he already had his own artistic language. Hodgkin appears happy to be thought of as a one-off, but there have been attempts to place him within a tradition. One of the more interesting sees him as following on from Ivon Hitchens, whose vividly colourful depictions of the English landscape from the 40s to the 70s hover between abstraction and figuration. Richard Shone of the Burlington magazine says that while Hodgkin has developed his own very personal synthesis of various artistic traditions, \"all young artists take on an aspect of their time. You can't come out of nowhere, and certainly in his early work with the bright, frontal colour and the relaxed young people sit ting in rooms, there are aspects of pop art with a small p.\" Hodgkin says that he was very proud to once appear in the index of a book on pop art under the entry: \"Howard Hodgkin is not a pop artist.\" The critic David Sylvester sees a longer heritage. \"There is an atmospheric lyricism in his work that is very English and can be traced back to Turner. I think Howard is steeped in Turner.\" Hodgkin has spoken about the importance of Matisse and the Intimist work of the French painter Edouard Vuillard, but says that as a young artist, the key exhibitions he saw in London were of contemporary American art put on by the United States Information Service. He was struck by the work of Barnett Newman and Stuart Davis, but the most influential was Jackson Pollock. \"Seeing the Pollocks was amazing for an ambitious young artist. They were there as, say, mountains outside your holiday window are there. They became part of my world, and that was a revelation. Seeing work like that can give you a new idea as to what is physically possible. It's not so much the content of the picture, but just the thought that, 'yes, that can be done'. It is often forgotten that paintings are what they are made of. Painting is a very physical thing.\" After finishing as a student in 1954, Hodgkin spent a brief period teaching at Charterhouse School, and then returned to Bath as a teacher, where he stayed until 1966. After that, he taught for six years at the Chelsea School of Art. He says he enjoyed teaching, but of most benefit to him was mixing with other artist-teachers. The artist, Robyn Denny, who was both a colleague and subject of two well-known Hodgkin portraits, remembers him as very ambitious as an artist. \"He was extremely clever, but not in a pejorative sense. He was complicated, learned, insightful and sort of duplicit and opaque. It is an odd combination that makes him an extremely interesting man. And combined with his ambition as an artist, it made him a powerful force.\" Chris Garrett, the cartoonist, and half of the Guardian's Biff cartoon team, was one of Hodgkin's students. He says Hodgkin was more like a dance teacher in that he always demanded the best. \"He scared the living daylights out of us. He'd set an exercise and then walk round the studio. You'd hear him saying, 'that's terrible, rub it out', and then a whimper from the student. 'Stop trying to look like an artist, just be one'.\" Garrett adds: \"Maybe in the third year he'd offer you a Woodbine, which was a sign something was good. He was difficult to fathom. He always wore a dark suit and tie and had this very austere, punctilious way of teaching. But his paintings were packed with these great bloody colours blasted on the canvas, which had been the product of an obviously very intense kind of operation. I once saw him in his suit, and there was a tiny spot of brilliant viridian green on his black Oxford shoes. It was the only hint of what he had been doing.\" By this time Hodgkin was married with a young family. He and Julia Lane met as art students at Corsham and they married in 1955. She went on to teach art in a school, and then to run the florist shop at Heal's furniture shop in London. Hodgkin commuted to Bath from their flat in Shepherds Bush, where he remembers holes in the carpets were covered with dog skins - \"a little Scottie here, something else there. It was revolting, and we got rid of them in the end.\" Their first son, Louis, was born in 1958, and then Sam in 1960. \"Louis lives in the country and cultivates his garden,\" says Hodgkin. \"I don't know how he gets by but he is completely happy. People go and see him because he's so happy. He's like a guru or something. Sam, on the other hand, is not so happy.\" He laughs. \"He works in television.\" Hodgkin was not very productive when his children were young. \"Julia once asked me how can I call myself a painter when I don't actually paint. It wasn't so neat that I started to paint immediately, but I was upset by it and it struck home.\" This tentativeness was reflected in his business relationship with dealers. When the Arthur Tooth gallery in Dover Street put on his first show in 1962, they offered him a contract that would double every year. \"But I insisted it stayed the same,\" says Hodgkin. \"I always worried where the next picture was coming from and it would have been too much pressure. Little did I know what was to come in terms of pressure.\" As well as teaching and being an artist during the 60s, Hodgkin became a serious collector of 16th and 17th-century Indian painting. His collection became one of the best in the world, and has been widely exhibited. \"For a while it was a wonderful other activity,\" he says. \"It was nice to meet other collectors, and I was good at it. But the collection becomes a monster with a life of its own. You have to have things to go with other things. It probably has affected me as an artist, but not in the way that people think. The Indian paintings haven't influenced my paintings, but collecting has made me very aware of quality, and increasingly demanding of my own work.\" Such was Hodgkin's commitment to his collection that he once sold 60 of his own paintings - \"not for huge amounts of money\" - to fund the purchase of one Indian work. His friend, James Fenton, the poet and writer on art and gardening, says that is the essence of a collector. \"It's more than being an accumulator. The important expression is 'the best is the enemy of the good'. If you have good things in the collection, and then you get something that is the best, the other paintings somehow have their noses put out of joint. I told him once that something was coming up for sale and it looked to be a bargain. He said this whole business of bargains is a diversion. 'Don't collect bargains, collect masterpieces.' That is Howard.\" Julian Barnes says Hodgkin's astonishing eye for quality means he can visually gut a municipal art gallery in eight to 10 minutes. \"And he would have seen, and more importantly remembered in incredible detail, the things that qualify as masterpieces. It's an extraordinary experience going round a church or a gallery with Howard. Typically, we'd be in a church with, say, a one-star Bellini altar piece in the second chapel on the left. We'd get there and there would be a deep, dark chuckle from Howard - 'I think not'. And then within 20 seconds he'll locate a small piece of baroque carving at the bottom of a tomb which was in fact the only thing worth seeing in the church.\" While there has not been a school of Hodgkin, his influence on the British art scene has been considerable. His reputation abroad has bolstered the image of British art, and his collection is significant, but equally important was his work as an artist trustee of both the Tate and the National in the 60s and 70s. In her history of the Tate gallery, Frances Spalding identified his importance in relation to purchases made by the national collections. \"With his immense knowledge of art and the art market, Hodgkin had a unique gift for either promoting or killing a potential purchase,\" she wrote. \"He might merely lower his eyes and begin to doodle, but it had devastating effect.\" Hodgkin has said he was amazed at how much clout the artist trustees had, and was instrumental in buying important work by Picasso, Matisse and Degas. He also paved the way for more radical purchases, recalling that, \"work by the likes of Beuys had only just come in and no one quite knew what to do with them. They just didn't quite know how to deal with a work that was made of felt and fat.\" Although always seen as ambitious, and a skilled operator in the art world, it took a long time for Hodgkin to break through as a first-rank artist. He was 45 before he had a major show in New York, and 52 when he finally won world-wide acclaim after representing Britain at the Venice Biennale. It is generally accepted that at some time in the mid-70s his work seemed to move up a gear. There is a neat psycho-sexual explanation, which was first posited by his friend, Bruce Chatwin. Howard had, \"a newfound engagement with the erotic\", Chatwin coyly wrote. It had led to a \"new persona\". What Chatwin meant was that Hodgkin's marriage had come to an end - although he and Julia have never divorced - and he was living as a gay man. Chatwin excitedly, and hyperbolically, wrote to a friend in 1977 that Howard's had become, \"the most publicised private life of the century\". In reality, it was a rather more smooth transition, and he has now been in a relationship with the music writer, Antony Peattie, since 1983. Hodgkin sees less of a clean break in his life than is popularly portrayed, pointing out a continuity in his art. \"The early pictures are to some degree a rehearsal for what was to come. The continuum might be a bit bumpy, but that's not for the obvious reasons everyone always talks about,\" he says. \"I had terrible trouble finding a way of painting. To some extent, I found my voice early and knew what I wanted to do. But learning how to do it took longer. Nothing is so simple as 'he's gay, look how the pictures have changed'. It just doesn't work like that. The processes are still going on.\" David Sylvester agrees that Hodgkin, \"has a more consistent line of development than you see in most artists. He found himself fairly early and remained himself.\" The critical consensus is that his work has improved over time, but some observers still prefer the much more schematic and hard-edged early work when his portraits, although his subjects never sat for him, still contained more conventional representations of identifiable people. Robyn Denny claims: \"His later work seems to coast with less tautness and greater serenity than before. It seems to lack the rawness, the rough edge, the sense of fear that permeated his earlier work and made it always surprising and remarkable.\" But the more orthodox view comes from Nicholas Serota. \"There is a consistent artist and a consistent eye there, but his work did become bolder and freer. His colours had always been very intense and hot, but they became much more complex. They were never beautiful paintings early on, they were regarded as being slightly awkward. They are not awkward in the same way now. They have an elegance and a beauty.\" It seems difficult to envisage now, but in 1976, when Serota was putting together the Hodgkin exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, not only was it a struggle to get hold of Hodgkin's paintings from the private collectors who owned them, but even getting photographs of some of the works was impossible. However, within a few years Hodgkin was an art superstar. In 1984, he was expected to win the inaugural Turner prize. In fact, it was awarded to Malcolm Morley, and David Sylvester recalls that, although Hodgkin was clearly disappointed, \"he came to a dinner with Morley afterwards and was very graceful in defeat\". He won it the following year. He was awarded a CBE in 1977, and knighted in 1992. Did the long wait make him any better equipped to handle success when it arrived? \"Not really. I find it terribly difficult to believe in. I've retrospectively regretted the knighthood,\" he says. \"I try hard to get it chopped off whenever I can.\" His success has had a dramatic impact on the price of his work. Two years ago, Christie's sold one of his paintings for a record $672,000. An astonishing change since Chris Garrett balked at paying \u00a375 for a painting from Hodgkin's second Tooth show in 1964. While the work has also been seen in more accessible formats - he has designed stamps, book jackets, ballet sets and the exterior of the Imax cinema in London - he has been criticised for producing work that can amount to pretty things for rich people. Richard Shone says: \"There are a series of middle-aged white male critics who think that someone who paints attractively and sensitively can't possibly be any good. Then they get hold of the fact that he's from a well-known family and that he is well to do - from his art - and it all counts against him. But he doesn't produce luxury goods. His paintings come out of him through blood, sweat and tears.\" The critic, Waldemar Januszczak, went on the attack after seeing the first painting on display at a show in 1999 which Hodgkin had, \"the temerity to entitle After Matisse. What! When did Matisse ever use a brush wide enough to sweep a station concourse? Hodgkin is not the English Matisse. Rather, with his increasing sentimentality, his cheerful colours, his obvious plotlines, he is the Walt Disney of British abstraction.\" Hodgkin says: \"There is an idea that if a subject is not grandiose and tragic, then it is trivial. Just imagine if Matisse had made today his famous remark about wanting to paint pictures that were like comfortable armchairs for tired business men to sit in. That would be the end of him.\" Hodgkin's next exhibition of new work opens in Milan later this week, and in June some of his older work will be hung alongside the old masters at the Dulwich Picture Gallery. Seeing the 17 oils for Milan against the whitewashed walls of his studio, a converted dairy round the corner from the British Museum, they are like a series of dazzling jewels that strangely transfix and draw in the exhilarated viewer. Julian Barnes sums up the powerful ongoing relationships the paintings can engender. \"On a first visit to a Hodgkin exhibition of 12 paintings you'll think there are three obvious masterpieces, six or seven very good pictures, and two that you just don't get. But if you go back, you find they all get hold of you and they never let go. So when you see a painting again after several years, it's much more than just an aesthetic reconnection: it's also a direct, emotional response, like meeting a person again.\" This chimes with Hodgkin's own long-term relationship with the works. He says the emotion that sparked their creation is left in the work by the time it has been completed. \"I remember seeing a picture of mine that I hadn't seen for a very long time, and thinking: 'ah, yes.' It was an instant recognition of that time.\" He now says he has many things in his mind, \"queuing up to be turned into something else\", and is increasingly anxious to complete the process. \"I can't think of anything rational that allows things to get to the front of the queue and be painted; perhaps an echo of something that happened now and also happened then. But now I do feel that time is creeping up on me and I've got to hurry up. I don't care a damn about what happens when I'm dead, but I do have a sense of increased urgency.

      "body": "<p>Thank God it's March, and the agonies of the shortest month are now but an unpleasant memory. The cheery presence of forced rhubarb, the first pink of the year, is in abundance and brightens winter's weary eyes. But don't let's get carried away just yet. Spring may be around the corner but, given our climate, there's always the chance of a chilly surprise or two - and the excuse still to indulge in warming puddings (as if we needed one).</p> <p>The classic puds of the British Isles are as rich in tradition as they are in flavour. The knack is to make puddings that are lip-smacking, rather than the leaden horrors of childhood memories. Spiking pears with vinegar and ennobling rhubarb with almonds are just two notable ways of enhancing such puddings. If there are other households out there like my mother's, with store cupboards crammed with all manner of jams, jellies and marmalade, there are few better ways of using some of those conserves up than in a steamed sponge or suet pudding - the marmalade pudding here is a real stonker, even if I do say so myself.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> STICKY PLUM PUDDING </b><br> The dried fruit of San Francisco's farmers' market is the best I've ever seen: it offers a quite stunning array of sultanas, raisins, apricots, figs et al. Agen prunes are the only dried fruit I've come across of a similar quality. A moment of excess led to this dish: a pot of prunes needed using up and so were added to a cake batter. It may have been a wanton use of such a noble fruit, but it made for a marvellous dessert.</p> <p>120g sultanas <br> 230g Agen prunes <br> 125g unsalted butter <br> 360g soft, dark brown sugar <br> 2 eggs <br> 450g plain flour <br> 1 tsp baking powder <br> 570ml water <br> 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br> 1 tsp vanilla extract <br></p> <p>For the topping</p> <p>100ml whipping cream <br> 1 tbsp soft, dark brown sugar <br> 1 tbsp treacle <br> 1-2 drops vanilla extract</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Place the sultanas in a pan, and pour in enough water just to cover. Place on a high heat and cook until the water evaporates. Stone the prunes.</p> <p>Line a 25-27cm diameter, 4-5cm deep cake tin. Beat the butter and sugar until creamed. Crack the eggs into a jug, mix with a fork, then, beating continuously, pour into the butter mix. Sift the flour and baking powder on to the mixture, and fold in. Boil the 570ml water, tip over the prunes and stir in the bicarb. The reaction will be instantaneous, so stir and pour on to the cake mix with haste. Add the sultanas and vanilla extract, and stir until you have a smooth batter of dropping consistency. Tip the lot into the cake tin, bake for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Bake for a further 50 minutes to one hour. When the cake is done, set aside to cool in its tin.</p> <p>In the meantime, make the topping. Boil together the cream, sugar, treacle and vanilla until dissolved, then pour over the cake, which is at its best served slightly warm with a spoonful of lightly whipped cream.</p> <p><b> BURNT PEAR AND GINGER CREAM </b><br> It rarely makes sense to alter something so perfect as a cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e. That said, I happened on this recipe - which, to my shame, is adulterated cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e for sure - quite by fluke. I was making a batch when, among all the paraphernalia in the kitchen, I came across a Le Creuset dish filled with quartered pears strewn with bits of crystallised ginger. It was awaiting a crumble before being baked. My custard split, so I poured it over the pears and put the offending dish in the fridge. Out of sight, out of mind: or so I thought. When I came across it again a long lunch service later, the custard had set, so I gave it a dusting of sugar and a fiery blast from a blowtorch, then returned it to the fridge. Once cooled, it was tasted and pronounced very fine indeed. So there you go: not everything we do is by design.</p> <p>1 lemon, juiced and zested <br> 6 good pears <br> 1.5 litres water <br> 200g sugar <br> 1 vanilla pod, unsplit <br> 1 nugget crystallised ginger</p> <p>For the custard</p> <p>5 very fresh free-range egg yolks <br> 2 heaped dssp caster sugar <br> 500ml double cream <br> 1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, scraped clean and sliced thin</p> <p>Reserve a quarter of the grated zest, and put the rest, along with the strained juice, into a steel pot. Peel the pears, pop them in the pot also, rolling them in the lemon juice to prevent discolouring. Tip in the sugar, water and vanilla pod, and set the pot over a high heat and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer - weigh down the pears with a plate if they start to bob above the surface. Simmer for 20-40 minutes, depending on the size and ripeness of the pears; the pears should be whole but fully cooked. Quarter the pears lengthways, and remove all trace of core and stem. Lay over the base of a baking dish. Cut the crystallised ginger into small pieces and dot among the pears.</p> <p>Now make the custard. Put the egg yolks and caster sugar in a bowl, and beat until pale and voluminous. Pour the cream into a pot. Remove the vanilla pod from the syrup, split it open and scrape out the seeds, and add these and the fresh ginger to the cream. Set the pot to warm over a high heat. Once it has come to the boil, pour on to the beaten eggs then tip the whole lot back into the pot. Over medium heat, stir slowly and continuously until thickened, then pour through a fine sieve and stir again for a minute to cool. Pour over the pears and chill.</p> <p>To finish, shower the dish with a light crust of demerara sugar on top and then glaze until the sugar is melted and coloured a deep caramel; ideally, do this with a blowtorch, but under the grill will do. Cool and refrigerate. It is best to make the caramel just before dinner, as the crust will go damp and soggy quite quickly.</p> <p><b> RHUBARB AND ALMOND CRUMBLE TART </b><br> I apologise in advance for the first impressions created by this lengthy-looking recipe. It looks an awful lot, sure, but it is merely a list of parts set out in the correct order of preparation. The sum of those parts is a truly memorable tart. Its origins are quite good, too. I was working in Frith Street with Alastair Little, who had only recently convinced me of the joys of rhubarb. The eponymous one was dabbling with crumble tarts at the time, and there always seemed to be a pot of rhubarb and container of crumble in the fridge. One day, I just put it all together and came up with this.</p> <p>For the crumble</p> <p>100g unsalted butter <br> 100g plain flour <br> 100g soft dark brown sugar <br> 100g whole almonds, chopped fine</p> <p>For the pastry</p> <p>225g plain white flour <br> 115g unsalted butter <br> 1 tbsp icing sugar <br> 1 large fresh egg <br> 1 tbsp very cold water</p> <p>For the frangipane</p> <p>100g unsalted butter <br> 100g caster sugar <br> 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk (both at room temperature) <br> 100g peeled almonds, chopped fine</p> <p>For the rhubarb</p> <p>250g rhubarb <br> 150g caster sugar <br> Thumbnail-sized piece orange zest</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. First, make the crumble. In a bowl, work the butter and flour together until they are the texture of fine crumbs. Mix in the sugar and almonds. Cover and refrigerate.</p> <p>Next, make the pastry. Sift the flour and icing sugar into a bowl, then rub in the butter until the whole is the texture of fine crumbs. Add the egg and water, and knead into a smooth dough. Form into a disc, wrap well and refrigerate.</p> <p>Now, make the frangipane. Cream the butter and sugar together until pale, then mix in first the whole egg and then the yolk. Stir in the chopped almonds, and refrigerate.</p> <p>Finally, prepare the rhubarb. Trim and cut the rhubarb into roughly 3-4cm lengths. Place in a wide, shallow dish and scatter the sugar over the top. Drop on the sliver of zest, and cover. Place in the preheated oven and cook for 20 minutes or so, until tender but not mushy. Leave to cool undisturbed, then tip into a colander and drain.</p> <p>Now, you're ready to make the tart. Line a deep tart case (at least 1.8-2.2cm) with the pastry and leave to sit, covered, in the fridge for half an hour or so. Spread a generous layer of frangipane over the tart, then cover with rhubarb. Cover with crumble, gently pressing it down, then slightly roughen the surface by running a fork lightly over the surface.</p> <p>Place the tart on a tray, and bake for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 150C/300F/gas mark 2 and cook for a further 30 minutes or so, taking care that the crumble colours well but does not darken.</p> <p><b> STEAMED MARMALADE PUDDING </b><br> The season for Seville oranges may have been and gone, but at least all that marmalade made in January is at hand - I hope. I cannot help but feel that a pudding made with the fruits of one's own labours may encourage a domino effect with the other fruit crops as they come into season. Anyhow, this recipe makes a very, very good steamed pudding. Having eaten them regularly since childhood - having athletic children was not high on my parents' agenda - I have developed a rule for such dishes: namely, if it's going to add to the waist, it had better be damned good. This one is - and, as with all recipes that appear straightforward, depends entirely on good ingredients, notably a marmalade that is neither too runny nor too stiff. Only a marmalade made from Seville oranges should be used, as other confections just do not cut the mustard. It is obligatory to serve this with home-made custard, perhaps one spiked with a little ginger.</p> <p>3 large tbsp Seville orange marmalade <br> 125g plain white flour <br> 125g suet <br> 125g fresh white breadcrumbs <br> tsp ground cinnamon <br> 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda <br> 1 tsp baking powder <br> 1 egg <br> 2 tbsp Golden Syrup <br> 3 tbsp Seville orange marmalade <br> 1 tsp grated orange zest <br> 1 tsp grated lemon zest <br> 120ml milk</p> <p>Lightly butter a pudding basin, cut a small square of greaseproof paper and lay it upon the bottom of the basin. Put three large tablespoons of marmalade on it. In a big bowl, mix together the flour, suet, breadcrumbs, cinnamon, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder. Crack in the egg, add the syrup, marmalade and zests, and stir thoroughly. Pour in the milk; add a wee bit more if the pudding consistency is too thick.</p> <p>Pour this mix into the prepared basin, and seal thoroughly with greaseproof paper and baking foil. Pour 4-5cm of water into a wide, deep pot and bring up to the boil. Carefully place the basin in the water, and lower the heat to a murmuring simmer. Cover the pot completely, and leave the pudding to cook gently for three hours or so. Check the water from time to time, and top up with hot water if required</p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Lee is chef at Blue Print Cafe, Butlers Wharf, London SE1.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A recent survey claimed to prove conclusively that children and young babies do not, in fact, like teddy bears at all but would, given the choice, choose a cuddly dog, cat or, best of all, a stuffed monkey, as their faces so closely resemble those of humans. But if babies can exhibit such good taste, it makes it even sadder that so many adults cannot seem to get enough of all things Bruin. </p> <p>Perhaps you've seen that dozy bint on the TV who announces pertly,\"I'm in love! - with a pilot, a doctor and a musician\" - or something like that. Then, just as you're about to denounce her as a raving slag, up pop three teddy bears clothed in the appropriate garb. This, believe it or not, is an advert for a part-work magazine aimed at adults, which eventually results in a collection of some 20 tiny teddies all dressed up as something different; interestingly, Drug Dealer Teddy and Pimp Teddy do not seem to be available, which is a shame with Mother's Day coming up. </p> <p>Talking of which, perhaps you've seen the adverts for - wait for it - \"R*Fur\", a frankly manky-looking bear, 20cm tall, that is supposed to be a viable alternative to a beautiful bunch of blooms. DON'T SEND FLOWERS - SEND R*FUR! go the ads, assuring us that \"R*Fur will deliver your personal message with huge style and massive impact - he carries your message tucked safely inside his rucksack, travelling overnight to the destination of your choice, whatever the occasion.\" And the Beanie Babies phenomenon - what's that all about? </p> <p>I'm an equitable person these days, and not much given to intolerant outbursts, but when I think about adults wanting to have anything to do with cuddly toys, I really feel quite angry, to the extent that I think they should probably have their voting rights removed. I don't know what makes me angrier: if it's an affectation, and they think it makes them look \"cute\" or Bridesheadish, or if it's for real and the sad bastards really derive some measure of comfort from cuddling up to a nice bit of plush. </p> <p>Apparently, in America there are people known as \"furverts\", who can only become sexually excited by cartoon animals or people dressed up as them. But then, sex is a funny thing, for which one generally has to bend the rules a little, and so I find the idea of someone being sexually attracted to a stuffed beastie far less alarming than someone telling it their secrets. </p> <p>Of course, one of the reasons that we all aspire to be in love relationships is that they have the ability to make us feel gloriously grown-up (non-stop frantic kinky sex) and beatifically babyish (silly voices and pet names) at the same time. I'll come clean here and confess that, if you took away the non-stop frantic kinky sex, silly voices and pet names from my current six-year dalliance, there would be precious little left - but surely that's what it's for. To bring in a commercial middle man, however, who'll sell you bears to be silly with seems to me as strange and dysfunctional as seeking out a man who'll sell you a prostitute to have sex with. Are you really so weird that you can't get it the way the rest of us do? </p> <p>I'm not putting myself down here, but at my age and my weight, if I can get it without paying for it, anyone can. It is, of course, mostly women who turn to the comforts of plush, and it really does speak volumes about the failure of the alleged Sexual Revolution and the infinite resistibility of male genitalia to a vast swathe of the female population that so many of them would rather go to bed with Ted than with Tom, Dick or Harry. I've always thought it a real hoot, and quite telling, that the women who have sex with men most - prostitutes - invariably like it least, whereas the men who have the most sex with women like it the most. Surely this tells us something about the relative repulsiveness of the sexes. </p> <p>And, sure enough, it's invariably tarts and virgins who have the biggest cuddly toy collections, in order to keep the dreaded meat and two veg at bay. Think of Mike Leigh's Candice Marie in Nuts And May, forever clinging to Prudence to ward off the attentions of the vile Keith, or David Copperfield justifying to nosy hacks the reason why he and Claudia Schiffer always booked separate rooms when they travelled, because, apparently, he couldn't be bothered to clear her vast collection of furry friends off of the bed. Yeah, right. Funny how dishy Matthew Vaughn doesn't seem to have the same problem. </p> <p> Even sadder than the lengths a girl will go to to keep Copperfield out of her bedroom is the practice of certain types of counsellors and analysts of encouraging their patients to buy themselves teddy bears, which they are then told to hug, cry to and confide in. Apparently, this is common in many 12-step programmes to treat alleged drink, drug and sex addiction, and it's soppy enough then. But where it really becomes grotesque, I feel, is when victims of child abuse are told to do the same thing - something that my academic friend, a specialist in this area, assures me is the case.

      "bodyText": "A recent survey claimed to prove conclusively that children and young babies do not, in fact, like teddy bears at all but would, given the choice, choose a cuddly dog, cat or, best of all, a stuffed monkey, as their faces so closely resemble those of humans. But if babies can exhibit such good taste, it makes it even sadder that so many adults cannot seem to get enough of all things Bruin. Perhaps you've seen that dozy bint on the TV who announces pertly,\"I'm in love! - with a pilot, a doctor and a musician\" - or something like that. Then, just as you're about to denounce her as a raving slag, up pop three teddy bears clothed in the appropriate garb. This, believe it or not, is an advert for a part-work magazine aimed at adults, which eventually results in a collection of some 20 tiny teddies all dressed up as something different; interestingly, Drug Dealer Teddy and Pimp Teddy do not seem to be available, which is a shame with Mother's Day coming up. Talking of which, perhaps you've seen the adverts for - wait for it - \"R*Fur\", a frankly manky-looking bear, 20cm tall, that is supposed to be a viable alternative to a beautiful bunch of blooms. DON'T SEND FLOWERS - SEND R*FUR! go the ads, assuring us that \"R*Fur will deliver your personal message with huge style and massive impact - he carries your message tucked safely inside his rucksack, travelling overnight to the destination of your choice, whatever the occasion.\" And the Beanie Babies phenomenon - what's that all about? I'm an equitable person these days, and not much given to intolerant outbursts, but when I think about adults wanting to have anything to do with cuddly toys, I really feel quite angry, to the extent that I think they should probably have their voting rights removed. I don't know what makes me angrier: if it's an affectation, and they think it makes them look \"cute\" or Bridesheadish, or if it's for real and the sad bastards really derive some measure of comfort from cuddling up to a nice bit of plush. Apparently, in America there are people known as \"furverts\", who can only become sexually excited by cartoon animals or people dressed up as them. But then, sex is a funny thing, for which one generally has to bend the rules a little, and so I find the idea of someone being sexually attracted to a stuffed beastie far less alarming than someone telling it their secrets. Of course, one of the reasons that we all aspire to be in love relationships is that they have the ability to make us feel gloriously grown-up (non-stop frantic kinky sex) and beatifically babyish (silly voices and pet names) at the same time. I'll come clean here and confess that, if you took away the non-stop frantic kinky sex, silly voices and pet names from my current six-year dalliance, there would be precious little left - but surely that's what it's for. To bring in a commercial middle man, however, who'll sell you bears to be silly with seems to me as strange and dysfunctional as seeking out a man who'll sell you a prostitute to have sex with. Are you really so weird that you can't get it the way the rest of us do? I'm not putting myself down here, but at my age and my weight, if I can get it without paying for it, anyone can. It is, of course, mostly women who turn to the comforts of plush, and it really does speak volumes about the failure of the alleged Sexual Revolution and the infinite resistibility of male genitalia to a vast swathe of the female population that so many of them would rather go to bed with Ted than with Tom, Dick or Harry. I've always thought it a real hoot, and quite telling, that the women who have sex with men most - prostitutes - invariably like it least, whereas the men who have the most sex with women like it the most. Surely this tells us something about the relative repulsiveness of the sexes. And, sure enough, it's invariably tarts and virgins who have the biggest cuddly toy collections, in order to keep the dreaded meat and two veg at bay. Think of Mike Leigh's Candice Marie in Nuts And May, forever clinging to Prudence to ward off the attentions of the vile Keith, or David Copperfield justifying to nosy hacks the reason why he and Claudia Schiffer always booked separate rooms when they travelled, because, apparently, he couldn't be bothered to clear her vast collection of furry friends off of the bed. Yeah, right. Funny how dishy Matthew Vaughn doesn't seem to have the same problem. Even sadder than the lengths a girl will go to to keep Copperfield out of her bedroom is the practice of certain types of counsellors and analysts of encouraging their patients to buy themselves teddy bears, which they are then told to hug, cry to and confide in. Apparently, this is common in many 12-step programmes to treat alleged drink, drug and sex addiction, and it's soppy enough then. But where it really becomes grotesque, I feel, is when victims of child abuse are told to do the same thing - something that my academic friend, a specialist in this area, assures me is the case. As usual, our old friend the Inner Child is to blame here - has there been any more irritating or damaging pseudo-discovery, apart from feng shui, over the past 20 years? (If I ever find my Inner Child, I'm going to make sure I find my Inner Adoption Agency PDQ.) Surely the last thing anyone who's been abused as a child needs is to remain in a state of childlikeness, in which they will surely remember and relive that terrible vulnerability all over again. What they really need is to grow up, toughen up, see the bastard behind bars and put it all behind them. But, of course, if this were to happen, counsellors and analysts would have to start shopping at Primark - and we can't have that.

Try a black-leaved grass, such as Ophiopogon planiscapus 'Nigrescens', or Festuca glauca (left) for striking effect. Slender bamboos planted in a trough will create a useful windbreak or screen on a balcony. In addition to elegant foliage, some of them, such as various species of Phyllostachys , have interestingly coloured canes. Good examples for containers are P. nigra, known as the black bamboo (green canes that turn black in their second or third year), and P. bambusoides 'Allgold' (rich golden yellow canes, occasionally striped green). <p><b> Structure shrubs</b><br> Neat rows of plants of the same kind bring a formal quality to an outdoor space: little pots of clipped box, say, or auricula primroses. Big containers in pairs look good around a doorway. You can ring the changes with a different flowering display for every season: parrot tulips for spring, cannas or regal lilies for summer, and dahlias for the late summer. Flowering shrubs for containers include the silvery-leaved evergreen Brachyglottis 'Sunshine', with its yellow daisy flowers in summer, or hydrangeas, which last well into autumn. Good evergreens include Hebe pinguifolia 'Pagei' or miniature junipers (such as J. communis 'Compressa'). </p> <p><b> Hostas</b> <br> Hostas, with their striking, architectural foliage and delicate, trumpet-like flowers (left) are a good bet for a long-lasting display. Plant up a 25cm diameter terracotta pot with a showy, big-leaved version such as Hosta sieboldiana 'Elegans'. It will look good from late spring to early autumn. Try surrounding it with early bulbs such as crocuses or dwarf narcissus ('T te-\u00e0-T te') to create a touch of colour before the hosta leaves unfurl. Hostas are suitable for a shady area. </p> <p> When it comes to creating a beautiful garden in a small space, a little knowledge goes a surprisingly long way. As well as a supply of good-looking containers and multipurpose compost to fill them, an awareness of which plants do what and at which particular times of the year, really helps. But this should not put you off. For example, small-leaved, evergreen shrubs such as box, and evergreen climbers such as ivy, are a good start - persuade them to grow into interesting shapes by clipping the former a couple of times during the summer or training the latter up wires and trimming out straggling shoots. Ivy also thrives in shade, as do ferns and heucheras, which have broad, coloured leaves. There are a few tips for making the most of your space. Think vertically as well as horizontally, and use shelves, racks and even the table you eat from for your display. Grow climbers over frames or plant trailing annuals positioned on a high wall, so that they cascade and make the most of vertical space. Dead-head flowering perennials regularly to encourage a longer display from your limited stock. As for what to put into those containers to maximise the display year-round, try these for size: </p> <p><b> Summer annuals</b><br> Keep one pot for summer annuals and create an instant flowering display with trays of young plants from garden centres or flower markets. Lobelia, zinnias, nemesias, salvias, purple heliotrope, trailing petunias, verbena and orange French marigolds are favourites. Or you can be more adventurous and try planting seed - a packet of mixed annuals, say - making sure you read the instructions first. Nasturtiums are easy to grow from seed, and can be rampant, too. If you are the neat and tidy sort, best to go for a dwarf variety. </p> <p> <b> HERBS </b><br> Purpose-made containers with planting pockets designed for strawberries look good filled with herbs. Put bushy herbs in the side pockets - thymes (Thymus), marjoram (Origanum) and purple-leaved sage ( Salvia officinalis 'Purpurascens'), which will give year-round interest, and plant the top with annuals such as parsley and basil (easily grown from seed). Bon appetit . </p> <p> <b> Bulbs </b><br> Layer bulbs for a long-lasting display. In autumn, plant crocuses or dwarf Iris reticulata (above) with narcissus around the edge of a large pot (30cm diameter), with a central deeper planting of foxtail lily ( Eremurus ). Another idea is a scented display using 'Paper White' narcissus for spring followed by Lilium regale in summer.

      "body": "<p>Imagine, if you can, JM Synge, the spiritual godfather of modern Irish drama, collaborating, across time and history, with Quentin Tarantino, the bad boy of contemporary US cinema. Imagine Synge's ground-breaking 1907 masterpiece, The Playboy Of The Western World, remade as a blood-spattered black comedy, the green, rain-swept hills of his beloved wild west of Ireland peopled not by blighted peasants with the fabled gift of the gab, but by gun-toting, would-be gangsters spouting lines learned from John Woo action movies. Now, into this surreal mix, add an element of cutting-edge social satire in the form of a psychopathic, pet-loving Irish terrorist who imagines \"an Ireland free for cats to roam about without fear\". Still with me? Good. You've just imagined your way into the new Martin McDonagh play, The Lieutenant Of Inishmore. </p> <p>In the Royal Shakespeare Company's rehearsal space in Clapham, south London, the 30-year-old McDonagh, looking dapper in a suit and crisp, white shirt, is overseeing preparations for the imminent staging of a work that, he gleefully tells me, \"will have more gunshots and squibs going off on stage than any play you've ever seen\". It will also involve, in no particular order of outrage: a trussed-up man, hanging upside down, who has had his toenails pulled out; the blinding of three characters by a woman with an air gun; the chopping up of a corpse; and the painting of a cat. It is, it might be worth adding at this point, a comedy; a sometimes absurd, often angry, and relentlessly cruel comedy, but a comedy all the same. </p> <p>Not everyone has got the joke. The play, which receives its world premiere at Stratford next month, has taken five years to reach the stage. In that time, it has been passed over by various prestigious dramatic institutions, including the National Theatre. According to McDonagh, the National's Trevor Nunn thought the play so inflammatory that its production might threaten the Northern Irish peace process. Nunn's suitably theatrical overreaction might, McDonagh suspects, be symptomatic of a certain self-important luvvie culture that blights English theatre. Then again, it might be born of the not altogether absurd notion that making fun of extreme Irish Republican terrorist groups - in this instance, the Irish National Liberation Army - may, quite literally, be a deadly serious business. Whichever, McDonagh is not impressed. \"There's a certain big-headedness about that kind of reaction, isn't there? Plus, if it was the case, which it isn't, surely we should be writing stuff that stirs it up.\" </p> <p>And stir it up The Lieutenant Of Inishmore will most surely do. Its plot hinges on the mysterious killing of a cat that belongs to Inishmore's resident INLA terrorist, Padraic, and attempts to replace the beloved moggy with a ginger tom, covered in black shoe polish. Around this raggedy premise - part old-fashioned farce, part Father Ted-style surreal sitcom - McDonagh has pulled off his usual trick of creating a world that is both utterly recognisable and disturbingly unreal, comical and cruel. In many ways, then, The Lieutenant Of Inishmore is not unlike McDonagh's other plays, most notably The Beauty Queen Of Leenane and The Cripple Of Inishmaan, each of which premiered in the mid-90s to both critical acclaim and packed houses; at 27, McDonagh became the first playwright since Shakespeare to have four plays performed simultaneously in London. Since then, he has been garlanded with prizes in Britain, Ireland and America, where one critic recently dubbed him \"the first great dramatist of the 21st century\". </p> <p>Following this sudden, and unexpected brush with success, McDonagh found himself feted both here and in New York as the latest enfant terrible of theatre, a role he initially relished, but then reacted against in some unexpected ways. \"You think it's what you want,\" he frowns, \"then, of course, it's nothing like you expect. I think as a writer you never have to flee from fame because you're not that visible in the first place, but, after the Broadway success of Beauty Queen, people were coming up to me all the time, and I wasn't really prepared for that level of attention. It's a really uncomfortable and unsettling experience to suddenly be public property.\" </p> <p>More unsettling still was the press furore that attended his now legendary brush with the higher echelons of British thespian establishment after he won Most Promising Newcomer prize at the 1996 Evening Standard Theatre Awards. For a while back then, it looked as if McDonagh would be known primarily not as a major new writer, but as the man who told James Bond to \"fuck off\". Despite his brief spell of tabloid notoriety, he remains unrepentant. \"It was drunken eejit stuff, really,\" he grins. \"That wanker journalist, Max Hastings, was toasting the Queen. I mean, come on - it was bullshit. Do these people take no account of how many people in there were actually British, let alone how many even supported her? Anyway, me and my brother, John, were taking the piss, and next thing I know there's a hand on my shoulder, and Sean Connery is standing over me, saying, 'Shut up, or leave', in that James Bond voice of his. It was surreal. I mean, is this guy supposed to be a Scottish Nationalist, or what? Anyway, I initially said, 'Sorry, no offence, mate', then I thought about it, and went, 'Yeah, right, fuck off mate'.\" All he remembers after that is \"this awful silence\" as every head in the room turned in his direction. </p> <p>Later, in the early hours of the morning, a tabloid journalist somehow got hold of his home phone number and rang him. Still drunk, he slagged off Connery some more. \"It was good journalism, I thought, but it just grew and grew. The worst thing about it was that my mother was totally mortified - wouldn't speak to me for a week.\" </p> <p>You get the feeling that McDonagh, and, indeed the Royal Shakespeare Company, are bracing themselves for another tabloid storm when The Lieutenant Of Inishmore opens. Like its illustrious predecessors, the play is a traditionally structured narrative that belts along on the sheer brio of the dialogue, and whose unlikely plot is set in a rural west of Ireland landscape familiar from Synge, who remains the most obvious touchstone. Except that, in McDonagh's work, this almost mythic rural Ireland of cottages and colleens clashes with what Irish theatre writer, Fintan O'Toole, describes as \"a postmodern Ireland shaped by media imagery, by multinational companies, and by tourism\". </p> <p>The new play also possesses what are, perhaps, this young playwright's two key signatures: an exaggerated-to-the-point-of-grotesque cast of characters who skate dangerously close to caricature, and a humour that emerges from an almost casual, but never less than vicious, cruelty. \"I suppose I walk that line between comedy and cruelty,\" admits McDonagh, sipping a Coke in a bar around the corner from the rehearsal studio, \"because I think one illuminates the other. And, yeah, I tend to push things as far as I can because I think you can see things more clearly through exaggeration than through reality. It's like a John Woo or a Tarantino scene, where the characters are doing awful things and, simultaneously, talking about everyday things in a really humorous way. There is a humour in there that is straight-ahead funny and uncomfortable. It makes you laugh and think.\" </p> <p>This is a tightrope that McDonagh, London-born and bred but of Irish parents, has walked before to dazzlingly dramatic effect. The celebrated Irish theatre director, Garry Hynes, who first staged McDonagh's work with the Druid Theatre, recalls a \"particularly revealing incident when we premiered The Beauty Queen Of Leenane in Galway. A woman came up to me in the lobby, wiping the tears from her eyes, and said, 'I have a funny feeling that I shouldn't be laughing so hard'. That, for me, is a pure Martin McDonagh moment.\" </p> <p>A few years back, I experienced something similar, albeit on a much larger scale. While staying in County Monaghan, on the Irish border, I attended a touring production of The Lonesome West, the final play of the celebrated Leenane trilogy. In a packed village hall, where the audience ranged from nine-year-olds and tots in pushchairs to pensioners with rugs across their knees, every surreal twist and turn of the play was greeted with whoops of delight or gasps of horror; every Keatonesque visual gag met with hoots of laughter. The penultimate scene, in which Coleman Connor blows a hole in his brother Valene's beloved new cooker, caused complete uproar in the audience. For a confirmed theatre-phobe such as myself, it was a salutary lesson in living, breathing theatre - of the people, for the people. </p> <p>\"That's what Beauty Queen was like when we performed it on Inisheer,\" grins McDonagh when I relay the story to him. \"Leaving aside that nobody turned up on time because of the weather and we were sweating, looking at an empty theatre at 8pm, it was a complete vindication. People loved it. Same all over Ireland. The only place I've had any grief is here in London from a few English punters going on about how I was taking the piss out of Irish people.\" How does he respond to the inevitable accusations of cultural stereotyping? \"I don't even enter into it. I mean, I don't feel I have to defend myself for being English or for being Irish, because, in a way, I don't feel either. And, in another way, of course, I'm both. That's exactly what the work arises out of, and it's interesting to me that it tends to be English people who have problems with that. But, ultimately, I don't really feel I have to defend anything, really.\" </p> <p>The Lieutenant Of Inishmore, however, crosses over into territory that is altogether more provocative, incendiary even, than his other plays. It is difficult to imagine it being staged, for example, in South Armagh or even in West Belfast, where the scars and traumas of the still fresh, and possibly unfinished, armed struggle are deep and uncauterised. Is it, the play made me wonder in places, too soon to poke fun at Irish Republican terrorism, or simply - no irony intended - beyond the pale, period? Indeed, does someone who grew up in the relative safety of south London have the right to \"stir it up\" with regard to Northern Ireland's bloody recent history for a middle-class, English theatre-going audience? </p> <p>\"I know I'll probably get a lot of shit for it, because I don't come from Northern Ireland, but I would never let that stop me,\" counters McDonagh after a longer than usual pause, \"Plus, everyone was affected by the violence, including people in London. Having grown up Catholic and, to a certain degree, Republican, I thought I should tackle the problems on my own side, so to speak. I chose the INLA because they seemed so extreme and, to be honest, because I thought I'd be less at risk. I'm not being heroic or anything - it was just something I felt I had to write about. The play came from a position of what you might call pacifist rage. I mean, it's a violent play that is wholeheartedly anti-violence. The bottom line, I suppose, is that I believe that if a piece of work is well written, you can tackle anything.\" </p> <p>What intrigues me, though, is why McDonagh chose to tackle the subject through the medium of comedy. Did it ever cross his mind that there were certain places that you just cannot go with comedy? Another pause. \"No, never. I probably should, but it's those very places that intrigue me. I kind of felt that this stuff had to be dealt with in the blackly sick way in which we sometimes react to it. I think a lot of the stuff that has happened in the past 25 years has been a sick joke. I'm not trying to solve anything, the same way as I am not trying to damage anything; just looking at it in a different way. I mean, how else can you react to all that has happened through writing, or art or whatever you want to call it, if not through absurdity?\" </p> <p>After that other famous absurdist, Charlie Chaplin, McDonagh may now be the second most famous former resident of the Elephant &amp; Castle. The son of a Sligo mother and a Galway father, he spent his early childhood in and around one of those drab, grey tower blocks that rise up like watchtowers along the Old and New Kent Roads. The family relocated to nearby Camberwell when he was still a child. McDonagh remembers a house where the Sacred Heart shared wall space with a portrait of the Pope; where Irish relatives and friends would sing rebel songs whenever drink was taken. During summer holidays from his local south-London school, where the English boys were outnumbered by Irish and West Indian pupils, his family returned like annually migrating birds to Sligo or Connemara, an hour's plane ride and a whole world away from grey and grimy south London. </p> <p>Later still, his parents moved back for good to Lettermullen in Connemara; their son, left to his own devices, began to journey there through his writing. His first scripts were radio plays, which he sent out himself to little or no reaction, but which, he says, \"taught me that I could do dialogue and storytelling, which is all you need for theatre\". </p> <p>For a playwright, however, McDonagh is singularly unenthusiastic about the theatre-going experience, citing Sam Shepard's True West, Tracy Letts' Killer Joe and David Mamet's American Buffalo as the only plays he has ever enjoyed. \"I went to see the Mamet because Pacino was in it, but, mostly, the whole theatre thing just makes me intensely uncomfortable to the point where I react just like my parents - you know, 'Theatre's not for the likes of us.'\" </p> <p>His chief formative influences were the films of Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone, alongside the raw punk rock of Nirvana, the Sex Pistols and, tellingly, The Pogues. Like Shane MacGowan, when he could be bothered to write finished songs, McDonagh's London-Irish upbringing has given him a distance from his spiritual homeland that has bred a creative freedom that native Irish writers, even exiles, have fought hard to find. From that freedom springs both a respect for Irish literary and dramatic traditions and an irreverence towards them. No native Irish songwriter could have written a song such as MacGowan's The Old Main Drag, about an ageing Irish rent boy in Piccadilly, just as no native Irish dramatist could have have rode roughshod over the ghosts of O'Casey and Synge in the way that McDonagh has done. </p> <p>Thus far, his work has been primarily concerned with taking a scalpel to the remarkably enduring myth of an Arcadian Ireland that he, like Synge before him, has laid bare to reveal a dark, insular place of suppurating spite, internecine family feuding and simmering violence. He has set his plays in the only Irish places he knows intimately, the Aran Islands and Connemara, two of the most mythologised and elementally beautiful areas of rural Ireland. As one critic put it, \"murder, solitude and rain are what bind the plays in the Leenane trilogy together\". </p> <p>In The Beauty Queen Of Leenane, a mother and daughter are locked in claustrophobic mutual antipathy that comes to a head when the daughter forces the mother's hand into the hot oil of a chip pan; in A Skull In Connemara, the title taken from Beckett's Waiting For Godot, a gravedigger whose work involves digging up old bones and smashing them up to make way for fresh corpses, is suspected of killing his wife; in The Lonesome West, two brothers, one of whom has killed their father, bait each other mercilessly and mindlessly (shades of Shepard's True West). The bleakly comic world he conjures up is both utterly isolated and connected to the hyper-real global village that we all now inhabit via satellite television, the tyranny of Hollywood cinema, and the internet. It is a world of thatched cottages and satellite dishes, frustrated bachelors and murderous terrorists, virginal colleens and dysfunctional teenage girls who get their kicks by maiming cattle and, occasionally, humans. It is this casual, and often gleefully rendered, violence that seems to disturb McDonagh's critics, one of whom spoke to me off the record about his distaste for the writer's \"sadistic relish in his characters' suffering\". </p> <p>So, I ask McDonagh why he is drawn to extremes - of character, behaviour, emotions. \"Well, we're all cruel, aren't we? We're all extreme in one way or another at times, and that's what drama, since the Greeks, has dealt with. I hope the overall view isn't just that, though, or I've failed in my writing. There have to be moments when you glimpse something decent, something life-affirming even in the most twisted character. That's where the real art lies. See, I always suspect characters who are painted as lovely, decent human beings. I would always question where the darkness lies.\" </p> <p>The Guardian's drama critic, Michael Billington, while acknowledging McDonagh's \"enormous innate gift as a writer\", also wonders \"if he has anything original to say\". Billington prefers the work of McDonagh's leading contemporary, Conor McPherson, whose plays, The Weir and Port Authority (currently playing to acclaim in London), forego action - and, some would say, actual drama - for slow, unfolding narratives in monologue form that touch on more subtle Irish cultural issues such as male loneliness, regret over missed chances, and the mundanity of everyday life behind the old and new myths of picture-postcard Ireland and the so-called Celtic Tiger economy. </p> <p>\"Martin writes incredibly traditional, well-wrought plays that engage and involve audiences in a way that modern theatre has almost lost sight of,\" elaborates Billington. \"I remember John Mortimer going to see the Beauty Queen ... at the Royal Court and writing about the scene where the girl forces her mother's hand into the chip fat, and how he had never heard contemporary English theatre-going audience crying, 'No! No! Don't!' It was an extraordinary moment in contemporary theatre because, basically, you had a sophisticated, Chelsea audience surrendering to the conventions of an old-fashioned melodrama. In fact, throughout his work, the pleasure he gives an audience is the pleasure of recognition. His sources are visible for all to see, from Synge to Tarantino, and his Ireland is based not on real experience of the place but on an almost postmodern recollection of Irish drama in the last century. A playwright of real substance gives us a new territory, and offers us moral dilemmas. For me, these elements are missing from Martin's work, but they may well come with experience.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this is an opinion that finds little favour with Hynes, who, as the Druid Theatre's most successful artistic director, has been most instrumental in translating McDonagh's precocious gifts of storytelling and dialogue on to the stage. \"Martin is a south Londoner par excellence,\" she laughs, \"but to say he has no intimate knowledge of rural Irish life is wide of the mark. He went there every year and his writing could only come from those periods of concentrated proximity to that life. What he does is merge the parochial and the, for want of a better word, postmodern. He has that mix of influences and experiences that second- or third-generation Irish people often have, and he has an extraordinary ear for dialogue. </p> <p>\"People who say he has no right to write what he does, or that it is not authentic, are missing the point. If you're looking for authenticity, then do not go to the theatre. Period. We are dealing with a world of the imagination here, just like with Synge or O'Casey or whoever, and the imagination knows no limits. Surely that's the essence of theatre, not moral dilemmas or messages. I'd accept that he's young, and that he has a lot of living and a lot of writing to do, but the last thing we should be trying to do is close him off.\" </p> <p>For now, there seems little chance of that. Although McDonagh has not written a new play for four years - \"I simply haven't had the time\" - he is now working on an idea that, if it comes to fruition, will be his first non-Irish work. It is set in what he calls \"that dark time just before and after they abolished hanging. There was a real dark and grimy aspect to London at that time, and the miscarriages of justice are a part of it, and a metaphor for something sicker and more ingrained. I just have to get the story right. Though it may not seem like it, I never try to write about a place per se; it's always, first and last, about story. Story is everything. Story and a bit of attitude.\" </p> <p>He grins, getting ready to return to rehearsals for a play that may make or break his already controversial standing. \"It's like that great Sex Pistols' song, where he sings, 'I wanna destroy passers-by'. It doesn't really get any better, or simpler, than that. It just seems sad to me that nobody wants to shake it up any more. Everybody plays the game now. It's not good enough, is it?\" </p> <p>Maybe McDonagh really can do for British theatre what Johnny Rotten did (at least for a beautiful, liberating moment) for British pop music: make it vital, cathartic and life-affirming again.

      "bodyText": "Imagine, if you can, JM Synge, the spiritual godfather of modern Irish drama, collaborating, across time and history, with Quentin Tarantino, the bad boy of contemporary US cinema. Imagine Synge's ground-breaking 1907 masterpiece, The Playboy Of The Western World, remade as a blood-spattered black comedy, the green, rain-swept hills of his beloved wild west of Ireland peopled not by blighted peasants with the fabled gift of the gab, but by gun-toting, would-be gangsters spouting lines learned from John Woo action movies. Now, into this surreal mix, add an element of cutting-edge social satire in the form of a psychopathic, pet-loving Irish terrorist who imagines \"an Ireland free for cats to roam about without fear\". Still with me? Good. You've just imagined your way into the new Martin McDonagh play, The Lieutenant Of Inishmore. In the Royal Shakespeare Company's rehearsal space in Clapham, south London, the 30-year-old McDonagh, looking dapper in a suit and crisp, white shirt, is overseeing preparations for the imminent staging of a work that, he gleefully tells me, \"will have more gunshots and squibs going off on stage than any play you've ever seen\". It will also involve, in no particular order of outrage: a trussed-up man, hanging upside down, who has had his toenails pulled out; the blinding of three characters by a woman with an air gun; the chopping up of a corpse; and the painting of a cat. It is, it might be worth adding at this point, a comedy; a sometimes absurd, often angry, and relentlessly cruel comedy, but a comedy all the same. Not everyone has got the joke. The play, which receives its world premiere at Stratford next month, has taken five years to reach the stage. In that time, it has been passed over by various prestigious dramatic institutions, including the National Theatre. According to McDonagh, the National's Trevor Nunn thought the play so inflammatory that its production might threaten the Northern Irish peace process. Nunn's suitably theatrical overreaction might, McDonagh suspects, be symptomatic of a certain self-important luvvie culture that blights English theatre. Then again, it might be born of the not altogether absurd notion that making fun of extreme Irish Republican terrorist groups - in this instance, the Irish National Liberation Army - may, quite literally, be a deadly serious business. Whichever, McDonagh is not impressed. \"There's a certain big-headedness about that kind of reaction, isn't there? Plus, if it was the case, which it isn't, surely we should be writing stuff that stirs it up.\" And stir it up The Lieutenant Of Inishmore will most surely do. Its plot hinges on the mysterious killing of a cat that belongs to Inishmore's resident INLA terrorist, Padraic, and attempts to replace the beloved moggy with a ginger tom, covered in black shoe polish. Around this raggedy premise - part old-fashioned farce, part Father Ted-style surreal sitcom - McDonagh has pulled off his usual trick of creating a world that is both utterly recognisable and disturbingly unreal, comical and cruel. In many ways, then, The Lieutenant Of Inishmore is not unlike McDonagh's other plays, most notably The Beauty Queen Of Leenane and The Cripple Of Inishmaan, each of which premiered in the mid-90s to both critical acclaim and packed houses; at 27, McDonagh became the first playwright since Shakespeare to have four plays performed simultaneously in London. Since then, he has been garlanded with prizes in Britain, Ireland and America, where one critic recently dubbed him \"the first great dramatist of the 21st century\". Following this sudden, and unexpected brush with success, McDonagh found himself feted both here and in New York as the latest enfant terrible of theatre, a role he initially relished, but then reacted against in some unexpected ways. \"You think it's what you want,\" he frowns, \"then, of course, it's nothing like you expect. I think as a writer you never have to flee from fame because you're not that visible in the first place, but, after the Broadway success of Beauty Queen, people were coming up to me all the time, and I wasn't really prepared for that level of attention. It's a really uncomfortable and unsettling experience to suddenly be public property.\" More unsettling still was the press furore that attended his now legendary brush with the higher echelons of British thespian establishment after he won Most Promising Newcomer prize at the 1996 Evening Standard Theatre Awards. For a while back then, it looked as if McDonagh would be known primarily not as a major new writer, but as the man who told James Bond to \"fuck off\". Despite his brief spell of tabloid notoriety, he remains unrepentant. \"It was drunken eejit stuff, really,\" he grins. \"That wanker journalist, Max Hastings, was toasting the Queen. I mean, come on - it was bullshit. Do these people take no account of how many people in there were actually British, let alone how many even supported her? Anyway, me and my brother, John, were taking the piss, and next thing I know there's a hand on my shoulder, and Sean Connery is standing over me, saying, 'Shut up, or leave', in that James Bond voice of his. It was surreal. I mean, is this guy supposed to be a Scottish Nationalist, or what? Anyway, I initially said, 'Sorry, no offence, mate', then I thought about it, and went, 'Yeah, right, fuck off mate'.\" All he remembers after that is \"this awful silence\" as every head in the room turned in his direction. Later, in the early hours of the morning, a tabloid journalist somehow got hold of his home phone number and rang him. Still drunk, he slagged off Connery some more. \"It was good journalism, I thought, but it just grew and grew. The worst thing about it was that my mother was totally mortified - wouldn't speak to me for a week.\" You get the feeling that McDonagh, and, indeed the Royal Shakespeare Company, are bracing themselves for another tabloid storm when The Lieutenant Of Inishmore opens. Like its illustrious predecessors, the play is a traditionally structured narrative that belts along on the sheer brio of the dialogue, and whose unlikely plot is set in a rural west of Ireland landscape familiar from Synge, who remains the most obvious touchstone. Except that, in McDonagh's work, this almost mythic rural Ireland of cottages and colleens clashes with what Irish theatre writer, Fintan O'Toole, describes as \"a postmodern Ireland shaped by media imagery, by multinational companies, and by tourism\". The new play also possesses what are, perhaps, this young playwright's two key signatures: an exaggerated-to-the-point-of-grotesque cast of characters who skate dangerously close to caricature, and a humour that emerges from an almost casual, but never less than vicious, cruelty. \"I suppose I walk that line between comedy and cruelty,\" admits McDonagh, sipping a Coke in a bar around the corner from the rehearsal studio, \"because I think one illuminates the other. And, yeah, I tend to push things as far as I can because I think you can see things more clearly through exaggeration than through reality. It's like a John Woo or a Tarantino scene, where the characters are doing awful things and, simultaneously, talking about everyday things in a really humorous way. There is a humour in there that is straight-ahead funny and uncomfortable. It makes you laugh and think.\" This is a tightrope that McDonagh, London-born and bred but of Irish parents, has walked before to dazzlingly dramatic effect. The celebrated Irish theatre director, Garry Hynes, who first staged McDonagh's work with the Druid Theatre, recalls a \"particularly revealing incident when we premiered The Beauty Queen Of Leenane in Galway. A woman came up to me in the lobby, wiping the tears from her eyes, and said, 'I have a funny feeling that I shouldn't be laughing so hard'. That, for me, is a pure Martin McDonagh moment.\" A few years back, I experienced something similar, albeit on a much larger scale. While staying in County Monaghan, on the Irish border, I attended a touring production of The Lonesome West, the final play of the celebrated Leenane trilogy. In a packed village hall, where the audience ranged from nine-year-olds and tots in pushchairs to pensioners with rugs across their knees, every surreal twist and turn of the play was greeted with whoops of delight or gasps of horror; every Keatonesque visual gag met with hoots of laughter. The penultimate scene, in which Coleman Connor blows a hole in his brother Valene's beloved new cooker, caused complete uproar in the audience. For a confirmed theatre-phobe such as myself, it was a salutary lesson in living, breathing theatre - of the people, for the people. \"That's what Beauty Queen was like when we performed it on Inisheer,\" grins McDonagh when I relay the story to him. \"Leaving aside that nobody turned up on time because of the weather and we were sweating, looking at an empty theatre at 8pm, it was a complete vindication. People loved it. Same all over Ireland. The only place I've had any grief is here in London from a few English punters going on about how I was taking the piss out of Irish people.\" How does he respond to the inevitable accusations of cultural stereotyping? \"I don't even enter into it. I mean, I don't feel I have to defend myself for being English or for being Irish, because, in a way, I don't feel either. And, in another way, of course, I'm both. That's exactly what the work arises out of, and it's interesting to me that it tends to be English people who have problems with that. But, ultimately, I don't really feel I have to defend anything, really.\" The Lieutenant Of Inishmore, however, crosses over into territory that is altogether more provocative, incendiary even, than his other plays. It is difficult to imagine it being staged, for example, in South Armagh or even in West Belfast, where the scars and traumas of the still fresh, and possibly unfinished, armed struggle are deep and uncauterised. Is it, the play made me wonder in places, too soon to poke fun at Irish Republican terrorism, or simply - no irony intended - beyond the pale, period? Indeed, does someone who grew up in the relative safety of south London have the right to \"stir it up\" with regard to Northern Ireland's bloody recent history for a middle-class, English theatre-going audience? \"I know I'll probably get a lot of shit for it, because I don't come from Northern Ireland, but I would never let that stop me,\" counters McDonagh after a longer than usual pause, \"Plus, everyone was affected by the violence, including people in London. Having grown up Catholic and, to a certain degree, Republican, I thought I should tackle the problems on my own side, so to speak. I chose the INLA because they seemed so extreme and, to be honest, because I thought I'd be less at risk. I'm not being heroic or anything - it was just something I felt I had to write about. The play came from a position of what you might call pacifist rage. I mean, it's a violent play that is wholeheartedly anti-violence. The bottom line, I suppose, is that I believe that if a piece of work is well written, you can tackle anything.\" What intrigues me, though, is why McDonagh chose to tackle the subject through the medium of comedy. Did it ever cross his mind that there were certain places that you just cannot go with comedy? Another pause. \"No, never. I probably should, but it's those very places that intrigue me. I kind of felt that this stuff had to be dealt with in the blackly sick way in which we sometimes react to it. I think a lot of the stuff that has happened in the past 25 years has been a sick joke. I'm not trying to solve anything, the same way as I am not trying to damage anything; just looking at it in a different way. I mean, how else can you react to all that has happened through writing, or art or whatever you want to call it, if not through absurdity?\" After that other famous absurdist, Charlie Chaplin, McDonagh may now be the second most famous former resident of the Elephant &amp; Castle. The son of a Sligo mother and a Galway father, he spent his early childhood in and around one of those drab, grey tower blocks that rise up like watchtowers along the Old and New Kent Roads. The family relocated to nearby Camberwell when he was still a child. McDonagh remembers a house where the Sacred Heart shared wall space with a portrait of the Pope; where Irish relatives and friends would sing rebel songs whenever drink was taken. During summer holidays from his local south-London school, where the English boys were outnumbered by Irish and West Indian pupils, his family returned like annually migrating birds to Sligo or Connemara, an hour's plane ride and a whole world away from grey and grimy south London. Later still, his parents moved back for good to Lettermullen in Connemara; their son, left to his own devices, began to journey there through his writing. His first scripts were radio plays, which he sent out himself to little or no reaction, but which, he says, \"taught me that I could do dialogue and storytelling, which is all you need for theatre\".

      "body": "<p>Washing is something we all do almost every day, yet there are no standard instructions on how or what we should do. No wonder the nation is in crisis. </p> <p>First of all, you have to decide what implement you are going to use. The most pernicious of these is the face flannel. This is an absorbent piece of cloth that captures all the grime, bacteria and pus from your face, marinates it on the side of the bath overnight, and then deposits it all back on your face first thing the next morning. Face flannels wouldn't be so bad if they stayed on your face, but they are also used on parts of your body that only your doctor or somebody who loved you a very great deal would ever go near. </p> <p>People who wash in the bath have all sorts of instruments. They have big scrubbing brushes to reach parts of their backs that nothing else can reach. But consider for a moment: if nothing can reach round there, how dirty is it likely to get? </p> <p>Everyone agrees that soap is a good thing, but no one quite knows what it's for. Soap can make you smell like a lemon, which is great. But if you said you were going into the bathroom to make yourself smell like a lemon, people would understandably think you were a little odd. (Pity the poor lemon plucked from a citrus grove to end up in your armpit. It's not much of a destiny.) </p> <p>If you wash only one place this year, do your armpits. Otherwise, in an interview situation, you may suddenly find yourself with someone in your armpit. You should also pay particular attention to your private areas. Genitals are the most badly designed bits of the human body, with all sorts of completely unnecessary flaps, ridges and wrinkles.

      "bodyText": "Washing is something we all do almost every day, yet there are no standard instructions on how or what we should do. No wonder the nation is in crisis. First of all, you have to decide what implement you are going to use. The most pernicious of these is the face flannel. This is an absorbent piece of cloth that captures all the grime, bacteria and pus from your face, marinates it on the side of the bath overnight, and then deposits it all back on your face first thing the next morning. Face flannels wouldn't be so bad if they stayed on your face, but they are also used on parts of your body that only your doctor or somebody who loved you a very great deal would ever go near. People who wash in the bath have all sorts of instruments. They have big scrubbing brushes to reach parts of their backs that nothing else can reach. But consider for a moment: if nothing can reach round there, how dirty is it likely to get? Everyone agrees that soap is a good thing, but no one quite knows what it's for. Soap can make you smell like a lemon, which is great. But if you said you were going into the bathroom to make yourself smell like a lemon, people would understandably think you were a little odd. (Pity the poor lemon plucked from a citrus grove to end up in your armpit. It's not much of a destiny.) If you wash only one place this year, do your armpits. Otherwise, in an interview situation, you may suddenly find yourself with someone in your armpit. You should also pay particular attention to your private areas. Genitals are the most badly designed bits of the human body, with all sorts of completely unnecessary flaps, ridges and wrinkles. If these areas aren't washed regularly, huge fungi and edible mushrooms can grow in them overnight. Parents have this thing about cleaning the parts of the body you never think about. For example, what is so important about the behind-the-ear region? Have you ever noticed somebody in public with filth behind the ears. Of course not. There are a lot of specialist products, such as scrubs, exfoliators, etc, for washing the face. Be careful of these, as they can actually scrub your entire face away, leaving a smooth, plate-like effect.

Amid a week of financial turbulence, Tia Laverne Roberts, from south-east London, lost the least cash after taking part in a fantasy share experiment for national science week. Each participant chose three companies and their losses and gains were tracked. Tia picked her shares at random, financial astrologer Christeen Skinner studied the heavens and Mark Goodson used his experience as a private investor. Ms Skinner lost 10% on her \u00a35,000 shares while Mr Goodson lost 7% and Tia lost 4.5%. Ms Skinner said: \"I was a bit distressed by the experiments. The markets have been falling and lots of people have lost money. It's kind of sick to take part in a game while that has been happening.\" She said that her stocks had performed better than she had expected. Mr Goodson said: \"I said at the outset of the experiment that I confidently expected to finish bottom and that Tia would win.\" Experts insisted that investments can only properly be judged over at least 12 months. But Dr Richard Wiseman, who devised the experiment, said: \"I am totally up for performing the experiments over a longer period.\"",

Lord Justice Clarke condemned the captain of the dredger Bowbelle, which rammed and sank the pleasure boat with the loss of 51 lives. He also blamed the skipper of the Marchioness, and the companies which owned and managed both ships. The Department of Transport and the police also came in for criticism. Douglas Henderson, captain of the Bowbelle and still a serving ship's officer, now faces the threat of criminal prosecution or a disciplinary hearing to strip him of his master's certificate. After the publication of the report, families of the victims declared their renewed determination to pursue the companies who owned and managed the Bowbelle. They are consulting lawyers over fresh claims for compensation, after many settled for what they now regard as derisory sums in the aftermath of the tragedy. Eileen Dallaglio, whose daughter Francesca, 19, was the youngest victim, said: \"We have been emotionally crippled and emotionally raped over the last 12 years. It is time now for us to pick up the pieces in our lives and go forward, but first we have to see what can be done to tackle those people responsible.\" Mrs Dallaglio, mother of England rugby star Lawrence, said she had received just over \u00a3300 compensation from the owners of the Bowbelle, after legal fees had been deducted. The relatives have campaigned tirelessly for a public inquiry and were praised for their tenacity and courage by deputy prime minister John Prescott in the Commons yesterday. The dredger, a ship the size of a football pitch which was heading out to sea to suck sand for the construction industry, struck the much smaller pleasure boat twice and capsized her with the second blow. Packed The Marchioness was packed with more than 100 young people celebrating the 26th birthday of financier Antonio Vasconcellos when it was struck from behind by the dredger in the early hours of a fine and warm August night in 1989. It was the worst disaster on the Thames since 1878. Lord Clarke's report said: \"The basic cause of the collision is clear. It was poor lookout on both vessels. Neither vessel saw the other in time to take action to avoid the collision.\" Mr Henderson was blamed for failing to maintain a proper lookout system, to keep a good lookout himself, or to give assistance to the people who were plunged into the water when the Marchioness was rammed and capsized. Lord Clarke said the owners of the Bowbelle, East Coast Aggregates, and the managing company for the dredger, South Coast Shipping, \"must bear their share of responsibility for the collision for failing properly to instruct their masters and crews [on lookout duties] and for failing thereafter to monitor them.\" The Marchioness owners, Tidal Cruises, a company which still operates Thames pleasure trips, were also criticised by the judge for failing to instruct their skipper. The Marchioness captain, Ian Faldo, who died that night, was blamed for failing to operate a proper lookout system. Lord Clarke criticised the former Department of Transport, who he said had been \"well aware of the problems posed by the limited visibility from the steering positions\" on both the Marchioness and the Bowbelle. DoT officials had even predicted that such a tragedy might take place, with major loss of life, after the Bowbelle collided with a passenger launch the Pride of Greenwich in June 1983. But measures that were put in place then to improve lookouts and communications had \"fallen into disuse\" by 1989, the report said. Turning to the search and rescue operation, Lord Clarke said the police were \"ill-prepared for the disaster which occurred in that there was no specific contingency plan to deal with a major disaster on the river and that there was a dearth of rescue craft.\" But, he added: \"The police simply did their best with the resources available to them.\" Mr Prescott said yesterday that the Bowbelle captain's actions would be reviewed for a possible criminal prosecution. Mr Henderson has already been tried in 1991 on a charge of failing to keep a proper lookout. The jury failed to reach a verdict then, as did another jury at a second trial and he was acquitted. Mr Prescott said: \"The preliminary advice that I have received is that there is little prospect of a successful prosecution of Captain Henderson. I have also asked the maritime and coastguard agency to undertake an urgent review of Captain Henderson's fitness to hold a British master's certificate of competency.\" Mr Henderson, who is serving as a mate on a German vessel, confessed during the inquiry to faking signatures on documents showing how much time he had spent at sea. He used the documents to obtain the master's certificate which allowed him to captain the Bowbelle. The inquiry also heard unproven allegations that Mr Henderson had been dismissed from a ship in 1986 because of drink and continues to have a drink problem to the present day. Mr Henderson is known to have drunk six pints of lager at five different pubs the night before he took the helm of the Bowbelle, though expert evidence showed the alcohol was out of his bloodstream by the time of the disaster. Safety on the river has been improved since the tragedy, with the coastguard due to take over responsibility for directing search and rescue from police. Three lifeboat stations will be established on the Thames for the first time next year. Proposed legislation will also bring in an alcohol limit on the river for the first time.

Man charged on disappearance One of three people being questioned over the disappearance of Gerald McGinley, 34, who went missing in August, was yesterday charged with murder. The 34-year-old from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, has also been accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Improvement on railways The rail network has steadily improved since the Hatfield accident which killed four people in October, according to figures released by the strategic rail authority yesterday. Twenty-one of the 25 operators had improved the number of trains arriving on time in January compared with December.",

If the snobbish proscription upon eligibility to verify applicants identity were lifted, perhaps the poor man would be relieved of this burden. Robert Drury Louth, Lincs rob@drurypsm.demon.co.uk \u0095 Your correspondent R Oxlade (Letters, March 21) incorrectly quoted the signature song of Itma. I recall the words as being \"He's her pride and joy, Mrs Handley's boy, It's useless to complain, When troubles brew, It is his cue, It's That Man, That Man Again\". So far from causing trouble, he gave us something to laugh about during the dark days of the war. Had he caused trouble, Miss Hotchkiss (his secretary) would soon have been on his tail.

On Thursday William Hague was tramping around the Devon countryside. Are sudden u-turns are a sign of foot in mouth syndrome?

Otherwise it is all too easy to turn a nasty loss into a wipe-out - there is no room for mistakes,\" he insists.</p> <p>Kauders, who runs his eponymous portfolio management operation from offices in Taunton and London, has consistently warned that equity investors were riding for a fall. He prefers gilts and US treasury bonds.</p> <p>\"We've been living on a soft diet of easy credit since 1987 so there has been more money available to go into pushing up asset prices including shares. But this roundabout has to stop eventually and everyone gets thrown off. Japan is an obvious case in point,\" he says.</p> <p>He warns against taking notice of brokers and fund managers. \"They always have reasons why a downturn will be short-term. Yes, there will be rallies of a few days to a few months and those are signs to get out.\"</p> <p>The Kondratieff cycle, which suggests around 27 years between major bear markets, points to a fall - the last big UK bear market began in 1973.</p> <p>Few of today's market participants have seen a real bear market, he says.</p> <p>\"Tokyo has come back by 70% since its peak, the UK stock market fell 73% between 1973 and January 1975, while Wall Street collapsed 89% in the three years after October 1929. So far we've only seen 15-20% falls,\" he says.</p> <p>He believes that we could see 10 years of declining markets before any sustained recovery, hitting pension funds as well as Isas. \"The Footsie could be down to 2,000 before this bear market is over. The only safe investments are UK and US government bonds.\"</p> <p>Here's Kauders' keys to understanding the bear market.</p> <p>In a bull market, the rules are hold on, and buy the dips. But these rules fail miserably in a bear market!</p> <p>A bear market is not just a 10% decline followed by a new bull market. It is the whole cycle, leading to 60%, 70%, or even greater losses, with each new \"bull market\" nothing more than a counter-trend rally.</p> <p>The only bull markets we can find are in gilts, US treasury bonds, and the US dollar.</p> <p>But, thanks to derivatives, bears now have a second choice - they can opt for unit trust bear funds which gain as markets fall.

      "bodyText": "Private client broker and self-styled \"great bear\" David Kauders has a golden rule, write Tony Levene and Patrick Collinson. \"In a bear market, there is only one rule: Keep out. Otherwise it is all too easy to turn a nasty loss into a wipe-out - there is no room for mistakes,\" he insists. Kauders, who runs his eponymous portfolio management operation from offices in Taunton and London, has consistently warned that equity investors were riding for a fall. He prefers gilts and US treasury bonds. \"We've been living on a soft diet of easy credit since 1987 so there has been more money available to go into pushing up asset prices including shares. But this roundabout has to stop eventually and everyone gets thrown off. Japan is an obvious case in point,\" he says. He warns against taking notice of brokers and fund managers. \"They always have reasons why a downturn will be short-term. Yes, there will be rallies of a few days to a few months and those are signs to get out.\" The Kondratieff cycle, which suggests around 27 years between major bear markets, points to a fall - the last big UK bear market began in 1973. Few of today's market participants have seen a real bear market, he says. \"Tokyo has come back by 70% since its peak, the UK stock market fell 73% between 1973 and January 1975, while Wall Street collapsed 89% in the three years after October 1929. So far we've only seen 15-20% falls,\" he says. He believes that we could see 10 years of declining markets before any sustained recovery, hitting pension funds as well as Isas. \"The Footsie could be down to 2,000 before this bear market is over. The only safe investments are UK and US government bonds.\" Here's Kauders' keys to understanding the bear market. In a bull market, the rules are hold on, and buy the dips. But these rules fail miserably in a bear market! A bear market is not just a 10% decline followed by a new bull market. It is the whole cycle, leading to 60%, 70%, or even greater losses, with each new \"bull market\" nothing more than a counter-trend rally. The only bull markets we can find are in gilts, US treasury bonds, and the US dollar. But, thanks to derivatives, bears now have a second choice - they can opt for unit trust bear funds which gain as markets fall. They are currently sitting on top of the performance tables. Over the past week, while nearly all other funds have registered painful declines, the Govett US Bear fund has jumped by 7.9%. No other fund in the 2000 on offer to investors has managed to earn more than 2% over the past seven days, and most have fallen steeply. A Bear fund uses complex futures and options to, for example, give investors a 10% increase when the market is down 10%. Of course, it also works in reverse, so that if the market rises by 10%, the bear fund falls by 10%. Bear funds were only authorised by financial regulators to be sold to small investors in the early 1990s. Only two fund managers, Govett and Merril Lynch, launched bear funds, and Govett stopped offering its FTSE bear fund a couple of years ago after investor interest dried up. Conrad Preece, manager of Govett US Bear, says: \"Since the US market peaked, we have seen a steady increase in interest in the fund.\" But Mr Preece warns: \"They are mainly a short-term tactical device, so that investors can switch between bull and bear markets at low cost and at speed. We would not advise anyone to see them as a long term home.\"",

While concentrating on your core product or service, you need to draw on a range of knowledge and expertise including concept development, raising capital, marketing, negotiation, people recruitment and management. Conventional university and business school incubators have provided a protective environment in which new ideas can be tested and proved through a mix of advice centres, networks and seed corn funding. Typically, business school incubators act as midwives to budding entrepreneurs providing facilities such as a floor or corner of a converted warehouse, back office support, reception, finance and office equipment and most critically, capital. They operate at seed or first round funding level and are a vehicle by which venture capital or private equity funds get into entrepreneurial activities. However, for some large organisations, the existence of business school-based incubators is a cause for concern. Just as they have invested heavily in sponsoring an MBA for their most talented managers, the newly qualified managers spot a real chance of leaving corporate life in pursuit of independence and complete control over their careers. The more enterprising, creative and risk-taking individuals - the very people that organisations need to nurture and encourage as potential future leaders - are then lost to the corporation. The Henley Incubator helps to solve this dilemma, as a corporate incubator. It is aimed at \"intrapreneurs\" who can see a new wealth-creating business opportunity inside their own organisation. Organisations can benefit by releasing the potential business ideas of their employees and so retaining and effectively managing the best talent. A corporate incubator captures and recreates the birth of an enterprise buzz within the company. It can help to create a new dynamic in a company and develop a culture in which original thinking is encouraged and supported. It allows risk-taking and experimentation, with managers positively re-directing their corporate frustration in a way that will benefit the company. It can provide a low-risk, low-cost solution to enabling the best employees to explore new ideas outside the core business for the long-term health of the company. The company demonstrates its support for the individual, enhancing loyalty and retention. At any point, it can take a stake in the new business, bring it inside or walk away. BT Brightstar is a good example of one such corporate incubator which is rapidly creating new value for the parent company.

I'm also ripped off more than usual because I'm so innovative.\" For the new season she is working with denim and chiffon designs. \"It is bolder and more modern but also scary and drastic,\" she says, \"but the orders are starting to roll in.\" Jemima Khan, sharing the next booth at the show, has expressed an interest, as has Nuages in Aspen, Colorado. Come to think of it, Jane Austen wouldn't have looked bad in them either.",

(Choose your programme according to your audience's humour: \"majestic and serious pieces\" for choleric persons, chromatic and minor-key pieces for melancholics.) The irascible author is as entertainingly disdainful of egotistical virtuosos (\"some fantastic dunces among the Italian singers\") as he is of ignorant amateurs.

In his own preface Bradbury tells us he will play Baron Haussman with people and geography. Thus he sends Enlightement philosopher Denis Diderot to the court of Catherine the Great and keeps a bunch of modern academics at sea for an unfeasibly long 250 page ferry trip from Stockholm to St Petersburg.

      "body": "<p>Robert Crais arrived in LA as a stranger in 1976, carrying with him the writing ambitions that had marked him as a misfit in his family of cops and chemical-factory workers, in the blue-collar Louisiana town of Baton Rouge. Teleplays claimed him for a decade - episodes of Cagney and Lacey , Miami Vice , Hill Street Blues (for which he was Emmy-nominated), LA Law and more. But it's the 10 LA crime novels he has written since 1987 that have established him as the most mythically minded yet concrete observer of the city in his genre since Chandler. </p> <p>While James Ellroy maps LA's secret history, Crais charts today's media-manipulable law and venal Hollywood. In L.A. Requiem (1999), a dark tale of death, childhood brutalisation and betrayal, he also finds room for urban wonder: baking heat flinging up burnt forests as ash to rain down on the city; desert settlements so hot the inhabitants can't move; hidden parks that once housed missile silos; mountainside vistas that give Crais's private eye Elvis Cole hope, even as his life crumbles. </p> <p>\"My Los Angeles is different to Chandler's,\" Crais says. \"It's more ethnically diverse now, there are places which are purely Chinese, Vietnamese, Lithuanian. But it always has been a feeding ground where people from all over the world come, hungry to reach their dreams. And any time you have so many people risking so much, there's a potential for crisis, and crime. Not everybody wins the race. People search for an identity here, and often they fail, and feel rootless, desperate. All of this in a place which physically, by its nature, moves. Here, you cannot even trust the ground beneath your feet.\" </p> <p>Crais's first novel, The Monkey's Raincoat (1987), was on the surface a standard-issue private eye story, wisecracking, Hawaiian-shirted Vietnam veteran Cole solving the disappearance of a distressed pretty damsel's husband. But a wrenching moment when the man's little girl chats happily about her father to Cole (who knows he's dead), and the widow's numb inability to live by herself, were horribly personal. </p> <p>\"I had wanted to be a novelist for so long,\" Crais remembers, \"but I didn't have a story. That story came from the death of my father, and wrestling with how to help my mother. Writing it allowed me to work through my fears, frustrations and desires. I wanted control over the situation. And I wasn't sure I would have any in real life. But through the character of Elvis Cole, I could exercise a measure of the control and resolution I wanted. He's me, idealised.\" </p> <p>Cole's partner, the unsmiling, almost silent, fiercely loyal fellow veteran and supernaturally adept killer Joe Pike, is another side of Crais. Pike shoulders pressure, doesn't snap; neither does the hero of his new novel Desolation Angel : scarred, borderline alcoholic bomb squad detective Carol Starkey (it is his first without Cole and Pike). </p> <p>\"Joe Pike does embody some of my inner traits. His focus, his tattoos - red arrows, pointing forward - and what they mean, that you never back up. That's the way I've pursued my writing. Joe says: 'I don't like people with no will, no commitment, no pride.' I'm more tolerant than Joe. But I know that if you don't have those things, you are hampered.\" </p> <p>Crais learned that discipline in his Baton Rouge youth, when he was viewed as a \"Martian\" as he blazed out stories, comics and Super-8 films with isolated intensity while his family waited for him to become an engineer. </p> <p>He was influenced by crime fiction, and by seeing his police relatives as human beings (his books all sympathise with the LAPD). But science fiction freed his mind \"in all directions\", while the flawed, troubled superheroes in the early Marvel comics of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko deeply informed his own heroic fiction. And rugged individualist, right-wing SF writer Robert Heinlein reached his heart. </p> <p>\"Heinlein's male characters generally started as poor kids from shabby backgrounds, and they were able to rise above their past, not succumb to it. They worked hard, and achieved a certain competence. </p> <p>\"That was an important lesson to me. I modelled my life on it. I didn't have to stay where I was, do what my family did. I could move on, if I only applied myself.\" </p> <p>The catalyst for Crais's transformation came in 1975, at the Clarion Writers' Workshop in Michigan. In this \"boot camp for young writers\", under the guidance of authors including revered SF veterans Gene Wolfe and Samuel R Delaney, he and 25 others were locked in a basement for days, subjected to \"brutal\" criticism, barely sleeping, exhaustion cracking their subconscious - a fittingly Pike-like test of his writing desire. The next year he was in Hollywood. Despite working for American TV's most brilliant writer-producers of the 1970s and 1980s - Hill Street Blues ' Steven Bochco, Miami Vice 's Michael Mann - he quit to be a novelist, tired of the \"vampires\" diluting his words. </p> <p>Now he is a bestselling, wealthy man, happily married in the Santa Monica mountains (where Elvis Cole also lives). As it did for his Heinlein heroes, but doesn't for the failing criminals of his fiction, his journey to LA has ended in a waking American Dream. </p> <p>\"I know. I came here, and made it happen.

Their principal weapons are words and ideas, rather than guns and bullets. This unorthodox strategy of non-violent warfare has created a once-unthinkable situation in which the Mexican state has felt obliged to begin negotiations on the long-neglected rights of 10m indigenous people. </p> <p>The Zapatistas are clearly a very unusual group of revolutionaries. What other guerrilla army sees the battle for minds as more significant than the fight for territory? Our Word Is Our Weapon explains these postmodern insurrectionists, as articulated by their spokesman, Subcomandante Marcos. This anti-leader calls himself \"subcomandante\" because, he argues, the real comandante of the Zapatista struggle is the people; he is merely a conduit for their will. </p> <p>We have heard such sentiments before, from other revolutionaries who ended up interpreting the people's will in tyrannical ways. But perhaps Marcos is different. His writings certainly feel a world away from the prescriptive texts of Marx, Lenin and Mao. For a start, they are often lyrical and humorous. They pose questions, rather than dictating answers. There is no grand theory, only a series of observations and reflections: novel ideas expressed with none of the dogma, arrogance and elitism that have so frequently blighted other revolutionary movements. </p> <p>Sure, Marcos has his big idea: a moving, passionate critique of the new world order in which the neo-liberal politics of market economics and free trade condemns a third of the world's people to abject poverty - and frequently death. The next world war has, he suggests, already begun. It is a war of \"money versus humanity\", where the poor are trampled on \"like weeds in the road - silenced, faceless, nameless\". His recurrent theme is the struggle for democracy, justice and liberty in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, which he sees as a metaphor for the global battle against all forms of social exclusion and oppression. He likens these struggles to an echo that does not fade but \"breaks barriers and re-echoes\" from the \"local and particular\" to the \"intercontinental and galactic\". </p> <p>These writings are an engagingly eclectic compilation of conference speeches, military communiqu\u00e9s, news releases and open letters, interspersed with poems, short stories, allegories and folk legends. This is politics with a human face, and you sense immediately that Marcos is no ordinary politician when you read his tales of \"The Lime with an Identity Crisis\" and \"The Schizophrenic Pig\". These simple fables are embedded with political messages that reflect the challenges and aspirations of dispossessed people everywhere. The narrative is Mexican, but the theme is universal. </p> <p>Even the Subcomandante's hard-core political essays have a gentle, poetic quality, with titles like \"Deep Inside the Cave of Desire\" and \"Flowers, Like Hope, Are Harvested\". There is humour, too, including self-deprecating tales of misadventure. Marcos recalls one especially arduous guerrilla retreat in 1995 when, starving and thirsty, he and his companeros tried to drink their own urine and ended up vomiting all over their jungle campsite - leaving them even more hungry and dehydrated than before. </p> <p>Such comedies aside, Our Word Is Our Weapon articulates a new and important grass roots: a participatory, non-hierarchical style of politics. It is not about seizing state power, but dissolving it. Marcos's goal is to make a political space for the empowerment of civil society. His politics is more a way of thinking than a specific doctrine. </p> <p>\"Zapatismo is not a party, nor a guerrilla force,\" writes Ana Carrigan in her afterword. \"It is a catalyst, an instigator, a creator of possibilities. It provides a platform for the widest possible convergence of democratic forces, multi-ethnic, multiparty, multicultural . . . [to] return power to society.\" In this struggle, the means are as important as the ends, which is why Marcos styles his movement as a network. Eschewing traditional party organisation, he writes: \"This network is not an organising structure, nor does it have a central head or decision maker, nor does it have a central command or hierarchies. We are the network, all of us who speak and listen.\" The Zapatista revolution, by and for an outcast people in a remote corner of a distant developing country, has much to teach us about the creation of a genuinely pluralist, inclusive democracy.</p>",

If your watch stops, you can reset it by the time of the next train to arrive. In London things do not work quite like that.\" </p> <p>Tube systems are often metaphors for cities and cultures: you can tell as much about a place by what is going on several feet below the surface as you can in broad daylight. In Moscow you can map the political, ideological and stylistic course of Stalinism through the city's four main lines. Years after Stalin's death, the vast, ornately decorated stations were used by many youngsters, living in cramped communal flats with their parents, as a warm, dry place in which to court and flirt. The New York subways, where the Guardian Angels first spread their wings, once reflected the city's decay and paranoia. When Bernhard Goetz shot two black men in the 1980s, the \"subway vigilante\" became the touchstone of the city's key obsessions - crime, race and guns. </p> <p>Meanwhile, take the first tube into town from south London on a weekday and you will see little else but the red eyes and black faces of men and women on their way to cleaning and catering jobs in the City. Get the same train a few hours later and it will be packed with mostly white-faced white- collar workers going to the offices they have just cleaned. </p> <p>When it came to choosing our first elected mayor, the tube - underfunded, overpriced and overcrowded - was the central issue. Given the huge amount of capital needed to construct an underground system in the first place and the vast amounts needed to keep it going once it becomes an essential service, this is not surprising. \"The most important thing about the evolution of the subway as a symbol,\" writes Michael W Brooks in Subway City , \"is that it starts by expressing faith in the city's future and, once built, quickly becomes a handy rhetorical tool for expressing discontent with its present.\" </p> <p>So the vantage point of a station assistant on platform six of Oxford Circus station is as good a place as any from which to observe humanity. But then Ross is not just any station assistant. He describes himself as \"a philosopher . . . in search of truth\". His previous employment includes \"oriental carpet smuggler in Dubai; camel cowboy in Australian outback; Jesuit priest in a daytime Japanese television soap\". Now he stands in an ugly uniform with his job title on a glowing orange vest, explaining train delays, checking fire extinguishers, chasing beggars, giving directions and coping with bomb scares while mulling over the following: \"How might we best behave in various situations? How should we use our time? What duties, if any, were ours to fulfil? How can we say we know anything? Can we discover the purpose and potential of our lives?\" The mix of lowly tasks and highbrow thoughts is strongly reminiscent of Robert M Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance . Both in style and content, this is an ambitious project treading a narrow path between the banal and the pretentious. But with the help of humour, contemplation and sensitivity, Ross has produced a truly brilliant book. </p> <p>In the ill-fitting shoes of a station assistant, the world does start to look different. \"The Central line's fine, it's the passageway - it's flooded,\" Ross incants to thousands of passengers. \"Try repeating this continuously for two hours, with only the occasional break to answer someone asking, 'What the fuck?' or 'Call this a railway?'\" </p> <p>Every now and then it doesn't work; his tirade against begging Irish travellers, whom he describes as \"overweight, sluttish women . . . loaded with soiled and drooling infants\", is as offensive as it is unexpected. And what must have felt like deep insights at the time can become self-indulgent in print. The double question \"is breakfast a measure of cross-cultural tolerance? If I can stomach your breakfast, and only then, can I sincerely say we may live together without fear?\" sounds like a transcript from an interview between David Carradine and Richard and Judy. </p> <p>But Ross has embarked on such an original literary journey - largely by staying still - that it would be churlish to expect the balance and perspective to be struck evenly throughout the book. His musings are, for the most part, both relevant and illuminating; his descriptions of his job, colleagues and passengers are always honest, sometimes funny and usually humane. His account of the suicide of a young homeless man surrounded by the conspicuous consumption of the Christmas season is particularly moving. </p> <p>Through Ross we meet the random swathe of eccentrics that pass through the bowels of the capital. The man brought back to life by paramedics; the woman with the \"ugliest baby\" he has ever seen, which turns out to be a chimp in a nappy; the pet dog that is actually a tame fox. We learn that, on average, two people throw themselves in front of tubes every week; that there is a special squad to clear up the mess; and that green grapes are the number-one slip hazard - the underground's answer to the cartoon banana skin. </p> <p>\"The tube system is like the city's bricked-over tributary rivers,\" thinks the protagonist in Tobias Hill's first novel, Underground . \"A network hidden under the surface and visible only sometimes, like the blue veins where they lie near skin.\" Subterranean City by Antony Clayton is a dogged, valiant attempt to get under London's skins. Whereas Ross chronicles human behaviour through the tube, Clayton takes a long hard look under the paving slabs and down the drains and maps a London few of us will ever see. </p> <p>One would think there would be a limited market for a non-fiction book detailing the history and flow of London's sewage, people, power, gas, electricity and a whole lot else besides. But a book with an almost identical aim, London Under London: A Subterranean Guide by Richard Trench and Ellis Hillman, has been through two editions and four reprints since it was first published in 1984. Unfortunately for Clayton, any work in this area will inevitably be compared to that tour de force. Bravely, he rises to the challenge, insisting that: \"This work is intended to replace London Under London ,\" which, since it was last revised in 1993, is \"becoming increasingly out of date\". </p> <p>With a chapter on the Jubilee line extension and plenty on other recent developments with an impact on subterranean London - be it the advent of a cable network, Docklands or the proliferation of underground car parks - he has certainly updated our knowledge of the subject. But while London Under London attracts the reader with first-person accounts and conversational prose, Clayton's work is more academic in style and scholarly in content. Before you're halfway through the first page, he has drilled 1,200ft below Tottenham Court Road and is talking about \"Devonian Palaeozoic rocks\". As an addition to the body of work that exists, the book succeeds; as an attempt to replace the set text it falls well short.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In spite of the decline of the Navy, emotionally we are still a seafaring nation, and we have our nautical novels to prove it. So popular - and so lucrative - does the tradition continue to be that publishers are falling over each other to discover the next big thing. </p> <p>C S Forester's Hornblower novels are the most famous and probably the most accessible of the genre. Published between 1937 and the author's death in 1966, they recreate the Napoleonic wars with an eye for detail that has come to characterise the nautical novel. But in terms of sheer power of writing, Forester is outgunned by both Captain Marryat (1792-1848), author of Mr Midshipman Easy , and Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000), whose man-o'-war skipper Jack Aubrey has become a cult for armchair sailors. Each has recently been celebrated with a biography that is at least as intriguing as anything they themselves ever wrote. </p> <p>While Marryat was fascinating for what he was, O'Brian was enthralling for what he wasn't. For a start, he was not originally Patrick O'Brian; nor was he, as he later claimed, Irish. As Dean King describes in his excellent <strong> Patrick O'Brian: A Life Revealed</strong> (Headline, \u00a39.99), he was born in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, as Patrick Russ, the name under which he wrote his early books. He produced his first, about a panther, at the age of 15, receiving \u00a310 in royalties plus extra for Danish translation rights. A string of novels and stories followed, initially concentrating on the animal kingdom and then shifting to maritime matters. At 30 he changed his name to O'Brian (his brother, a platypus poacher, had earlier made a similar swap of surnames, calling himself O'Brien). </p> <p>It was not until he was 52 that he signed a contract with a publisher who was looking for the next C S Forester. Master and Commander was the result, the first in the 20-novel series featuring the bluff Captain Aubrey, who was partly based on a real frigate captain, Thomas (Lord) Cochrane. It also introduced Aubrey's buddy, the doctor and secret agent Stephen Maturin. </p> <p>Set largely - like most nautical novels - in the Napoleonic wars, the sagas contain much more than the clashing of cutlasses and booming of broadsides. They combine historical accuracy, wit, political intrigue and the flavour of London clubland in the early 1800s. Although the comparison has been made, it has to be said that O'Brian is not a second Joseph Conrad, whose soulful intensity he lacks. The enormous success of the Aubrey books was a long time coming, but when it came, it came big. Between the ages of 74 and 79, O'Brian published five new books in the series. By the time of his death, more than three million copies had been sold. </p> <p>While O'Brian was a navy reject whose books were based on meticulous research, Frederick Marryat was the real thing - a midshipman as a teenager, who fought the French. While O'Brian drew heavily on the character and exploits of Lord Cochrane, Marryat risked death with the man himself. He deserves to be remembered, and Tom Pocock's <strong> Captain Marryat: Seaman, Writer and Adventurer</strong> (Chatham Publishing, \u00a319.95) does a rattling good job of it. Marryat, we learn, was lucky to survive his first voyage, since a package of iron stored too close to the compass caused the needle to veer off course and the ship to scrape over hidden rocks. In a later raid, the apprehensive teenager was required to light the blue touchpaper on a fireship. The enemy was bad enough, but his own side could be just as lethal: a subsequent captain who disapproved of the cut of his jib tried to have him drowned. </p> <p>By his early 20s, Marryat had reached the rank of captain, devised a code of inter-ship signals, made an unsatisfactory marriage and achieved some notoriety as a nautical cartoonist. He saw action against West Country smugglers and Burmese war-canoes. He later gave up his day job in His Majesty's Navy, inherited a fortune and ran a literary magazine. The fiction that he had begun during quiet periods at sea turned him into one of the leading novelists of his time. </p> <p>As for the next big thing, one publisher claims to have found it in Jonathan Lunn, whose second novel, <strong> Killigrew and the Golden Dragon</strong> (Headline, \u00a317.99), declares its hero to be \"the Victorian Hornblower\". In fact, this is a clear case of sailing under false colours. The mantle of C S Forester is not to be inherited by Lunn's competent adventure novel about firing pistols in Hong Kong harbour, and the scientific but unseamanlike surgeon who stumbles into the first paragraph invites unfavourable comparisons with Patrick O'Brian's doctor. </p> <p>Much greater claims could be made by Julian Stockwin, whose <strong> Kydd</strong> (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a312.99) is the first in a promised 11-book series about a lower- deck equivalent of captains Hornblower and Aubrey. Thomas Paine Kydd is a wig-maker from Guildford who is pressed into service and is destined to rise to the top. Stockwin, who went to sea-training school at 14 and ended up as a lieutenant commander, gives a terrifying account of the brutal life and casual death aboard an 18th-century warship. There may be nothing new in his period or setting, but his vantage point of a common sailor gives the nautical novel a fresh twist. In his hands at least, it seems, the sea story will continue to entrance readers across the world - many of whom, it must be added, are more likely to be run over by a bus than ever to set foot on a ship. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.io.com/gibbonsb/pob/\" target=\"_NEW\">Patrick O'Brian resources</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.csforester.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">CS Forester society</a></p>",

But in terms of sheer power of writing, Forester is outgunned by both Captain Marryat (1792-1848), author of Mr Midshipman Easy , and Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000), whose man-o'-war skipper Jack Aubrey has become a cult for armchair sailors. Each has recently been celebrated with a biography that is at least as intriguing as anything they themselves ever wrote. While Marryat was fascinating for what he was, O'Brian was enthralling for what he wasn't. For a start, he was not originally Patrick O'Brian; nor was he, as he later claimed, Irish. As Dean King describes in his excellent Patrick O'Brian: A Life Revealed (Headline, \u00a39.99), he was born in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, as Patrick Russ, the name under which he wrote his early books. He produced his first, about a panther, at the age of 15, receiving \u00a310 in royalties plus extra for Danish translation rights. A string of novels and stories followed, initially concentrating on the animal kingdom and then shifting to maritime matters. At 30 he changed his name to O'Brian (his brother, a platypus poacher, had earlier made a similar swap of surnames, calling himself O'Brien). It was not until he was 52 that he signed a contract with a publisher who was looking for the next C S Forester. Master and Commander was the result, the first in the 20-novel series featuring the bluff Captain Aubrey, who was partly based on a real frigate captain, Thomas (Lord) Cochrane. It also introduced Aubrey's buddy, the doctor and secret agent Stephen Maturin. Set largely - like most nautical novels - in the Napoleonic wars, the sagas contain much more than the clashing of cutlasses and booming of broadsides. They combine historical accuracy, wit, political intrigue and the flavour of London clubland in the early 1800s. Although the comparison has been made, it has to be said that O'Brian is not a second Joseph Conrad, whose soulful intensity he lacks. The enormous success of the Aubrey books was a long time coming, but when it came, it came big. Between the ages of 74 and 79, O'Brian published five new books in the series. By the time of his death, more than three million copies had been sold. While O'Brian was a navy reject whose books were based on meticulous research, Frederick Marryat was the real thing - a midshipman as a teenager, who fought the French. While O'Brian drew heavily on the character and exploits of Lord Cochrane, Marryat risked death with the man himself. He deserves to be remembered, and Tom Pocock's Captain Marryat: Seaman, Writer and Adventurer (Chatham Publishing, \u00a319.95) does a rattling good job of it. Marryat, we learn, was lucky to survive his first voyage, since a package of iron stored too close to the compass caused the needle to veer off course and the ship to scrape over hidden rocks. In a later raid, the apprehensive teenager was required to light the blue touchpaper on a fireship. The enemy was bad enough, but his own side could be just as lethal: a subsequent captain who disapproved of the cut of his jib tried to have him drowned. By his early 20s, Marryat had reached the rank of captain, devised a code of inter-ship signals, made an unsatisfactory marriage and achieved some notoriety as a nautical cartoonist. He saw action against West Country smugglers and Burmese war-canoes. He later gave up his day job in His Majesty's Navy, inherited a fortune and ran a literary magazine. The fiction that he had begun during quiet periods at sea turned him into one of the leading novelists of his time. As for the next big thing, one publisher claims to have found it in Jonathan Lunn, whose second novel, Killigrew and the Golden Dragon (Headline, \u00a317.99), declares its hero to be \"the Victorian Hornblower\". In fact, this is a clear case of sailing under false colours. The mantle of C S Forester is not to be inherited by Lunn's competent adventure novel about firing pistols in Hong Kong harbour, and the scientific but unseamanlike surgeon who stumbles into the first paragraph invites unfavourable comparisons with Patrick O'Brian's doctor. Much greater claims could be made by Julian Stockwin, whose Kydd (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a312.99) is the first in a promised 11-book series about a lower- deck equivalent of captains Hornblower and Aubrey. Thomas Paine Kydd is a wig-maker from Guildford who is pressed into service and is destined to rise to the top. Stockwin, who went to sea-training school at 14 and ended up as a lieutenant commander, gives a terrifying account of the brutal life and casual death aboard an 18th-century warship. There may be nothing new in his period or setting, but his vantage point of a common sailor gives the nautical novel a fresh twist. In his hands at least, it seems, the sea story will continue to entrance readers across the world - many of whom, it must be added, are more likely to be run over by a bus than ever to set foot on a ship.

In the tradition of \"the Silent Service\", as the Royal Navy is sometimes known, most admirals have preferred to leave their memoirs to others. There have been many biographies of Nelson, of course, and John Winton wrote perhaps the classic of the genre in his biography of Admiral Cunningham. This included the hilarious detail that anti-submarine tactics of the first world war were initially limited to sending out a rowing boat containing the ship's blacksmith, a large hammer and several sacks. If the blacksmith were unsuccessful in smashing the protruding periscope with the hammer, a sack was placed over it, thus blinding the submarine. </p> <p>Of biographies of postwar admirals, including Mountbatten, none has covered the career of an officer who was more important or influential in the development of the post-colonial Royal Navy than Admiral of the Fleet Lord Lewin. Chief of the defence staff during the Falklands conflict, in the course of his 40-year career he watched the Royal Navy shrink from the largest and arguably the most powerful navy in the world to almost its present size. He saw the introduction of radar, the replacement of the battleship by the aircraft carrier, and the introduction of nuclear-powered submarines (Polaris and Trident). He witnessed the Sandys and Nott defence reviews, which severely diminished the role of the Navy, and the cancellation of the Royal Navy's aircraft-carrier programme under Denis Healey in the 1960s. </p> <p>Richard Hill, himself a retired rear admiral, writes knowledgably and consistently about Lewin - at, it should be said, his subject's invitation. They served together on several occasions, and Hill interviewed 150 people in the course of his research. His most important source was Lewin himself, who while dying of cancer dictated more than 50,000 words for the benefit of his biographer. </p> <p>Born in 1920, Terence Thornton Lewin had the typical background for an officer in the Royal Navy: he did not come from a wealthy background (Nelson was the son of a Norfolk vicar), had no family connection with the Navy and did not attend a public school. Unusually - at a time when most putative naval officers joined Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth at 13 - Lewin was a Special Entry cadet, joining at the last possible opportunity at the age of 18, having failed to get into university. Although promotion in the Navy has been based at least partly on merit since the time of Pepys, the Special Entry officers were viewed with some suspicion by those who joined by the traditional route, and relatively few were expected to reach the highest ranks. </p> <p>Lewin's training was cut short by the outbreak of war: after HMS Belfast (preserved today at Tower Bridge) was badly damaged by a new \"secret\" weapon, the magnetic mine, he was posted to the battleship HMS Valiant, which had just undergone a major refit, including the fitting of one of the first radar sets. His time in Valiant included the shelling of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir and the attack on Taranto, which was the model for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He spent much of the rest of the war on the Arctic convoys and afterwards specialised in gunnery, commanded a frigate, served as second in command of the Royal Yacht, and worked in frigate design at the Admiralty. </p> <p>Much of the remainder of the story concerns Lewin's role in the reconsideration of British naval power that came with the retreat from empire. This is why he is important: for the first time since the defeat of the Armada, national identity would cease to be associated with that old and increasingly expensive tune, \"Britannia rules the waves\". </p> <p>Lewin saw it all. In 1964 he was again appointed to the Admiralty, which under Mountbatten was being merged with the Air Ministry and the War Office to form the combined Ministry of Defence. The Labour victory of that year bought about an immediate major defence review under Denis Healey. A bitter argument between the Navy and the RAF led to the cancellation of the Navy's new aircraft carriers and their planned (later cancelled) replacement with RAF jets flying from land bases. </p> <p>Within a few years, and with Lewin's involvement, the Royal Navy was tentatively working towards procuring the Sea Harrier, to operate from what were being euphemistically called \"through deck cruisers\". It is even said that the politicians were carefully shown only side views of the ship, so that they wouldn't realise that they were actually ordering a smallish aircraft carrier. If such arguments had not eventually succeeded, the Falklands task force would have been impossible. </p> <p>Lewin became First Sea Lord - the professional head of the Navy - in 1977. From this lofty viewpoint he was able to witness the success of some of his earlier work, such as the launching of the first of the new aircraft carriers (HMS Invincible) and a fly-past of the new Sea Harrier. </p> <p>But the Navy's troubles were far from over. In September 1979, under a newly elected Margaret Thatcher, the decision to purchase Trident was taken. However, the service would have to pay for it out of its own budget. Defence Secretary John Nott's associated review of naval resources caused trauma throughout the fleet. Invincible was to be sold to Australia; the specialised landing ships Fearless and Intrepid were to be scrapped; the South Atlantic patrol ship HMS Endurance was to be withdrawn. It seemed, if things went on like this, that the Royal Navy would be reduced to nothing but a \"coast defence force\". One government minister, Keith Speed, resigned on principle against the cuts. Lewin did not resign, probably reasoning that it would only make matters worse, but he must have been bitterly disappointed. </p> <p>Then came the Falklands conflict, in which many of the remaining resources were put to the test. Thatcher was told that a task force not only could, but should, respond to the Argentine invasion. Lewin himself never doubted the decision to sink the General Belgrano, though he regretted the heavy loss of life. It is now generally felt by the Navy that this was unnecessarily heavy, but that the blame must be placed on the Argentinian response to the attack. </p> <p>Lewin retired in October 1982, and died 17 years later. He wanted to be remembered for bringing about social change, making the Navy \"more egalitarian and family-conscious\" without losing \"its traditions and heritage\". He was not against women at sea, but was concerned about his experiences of homosexuality at sea and its link to indiscipline. His wider legacy - at least as perceived in this readable and comprehensive, if not exactly exciting, biography - is that of an officer whose battles were more often with the civil service, politicians and on occasion other services than with the enemy fleet. But they were necessary battles and ones he fought bravely. No one was more closely involved in bringing the Royal Navy into the modern era.</p>",

Written in longhand between November 1999 and May 2000, it is a dark book, originally called Cancer and referred to by his wife as \"the one about the shit-weasels\". </p> <p>It's always been hard to keep tabs on King's incredible output. He once described the process of artistic inspiration as \"having someone crap on your head\", and this seems to happen to him with incredible regularity. Completed novels are often shuffled back in the publication schedules when a new book seems more pressing, as when he surprised his publishers with The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon two years ago. This appears to be the case here, as King had previously indicated that his next book would be From a Buick Eight .

Nevertheless, Dreamcatcher has to be read slowly and carefully to follow the action, especially towards the end, with characters possessed by aliens, reading each others' minds, and popping in and out of the plot.

      "bodyText": "Dreamcatcher Stephen King 688pp,Hodder \u00a317.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Dreamcatcher is the first novel Stephen King has published since his horrendous road accident in 1999. Written in longhand between November 1999 and May 2000, it is a dark book, originally called Cancer and referred to by his wife as \"the one about the shit-weasels\". It's always been hard to keep tabs on King's incredible output. He once described the process of artistic inspiration as \"having someone crap on your head\", and this seems to happen to him with incredible regularity. Completed novels are often shuffled back in the publication schedules when a new book seems more pressing, as when he surprised his publishers with The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon two years ago. This appears to be the case here, as King had previously indicated that his next book would be From a Buick Eight . Alongside the novels, he has also recently completed several screen plays, published an award-winning short story in the New Yorker and ventured into e-publishing with a new novella, Riding the Bullet , and a serialised novel, The Plant , that he first started 20 years ago.

In <strong> Mouthing the Words </strong> (Heinemann, \u00a312.99), her heroine Thelma has suffered every emotional indignity life can throw at a girl (multiple-personality disorder, incest, anorexia, nervous breakdown, attempted suicide). Thelma is an isolated and highly imaginative child, and her tales of growing up in Canada with neglectful parents are both funny and alarming. Longing to be adopted, she approaches one adult role model after another until she eventually becomes deranged by her father's repeated abuse. Gibb seduces the reader with sparky prose and charming storylines before drawing us onto a heart-wrenching rollercoaster ride through one breakdown after another. Thelma wins through, but we suspect it is Gibb who has bravely triumphed over adversity, making this a confessional of the most uncomfortable kind. </p> <p>In <strong> Love in Idleness </strong> (Review, \u00a312.99), Charlotte Mendelson has drawn on the venerable tradition of middle-class neuroticism made newly fashionable by the likes of Rachel Cusk and Raffaella Barker.

Shocked out of her blue stockings by the realisation that her aunt has been romancing another woman, she coincidentally unearths her own Sapphic tendencies. Not a lot happens otherwise, but Mendelson scores highly on the telling phrase, delivered with lashings of old-school charm. </p> <p>David Francis's coolly poetic <strong> Agapanthus Tango </strong> (Fourth Estate, \u00a310) is set in the 1950s on a horse farm in New South Wales. Day is only 12 when he witnesses what appears to be the murder of his mother by his father. He flees, eventually journeying to America, where he meets the elusive Callie, the woman he will spend the next seven years of his life helplessly pursuing in the same way that he hopelessly tries to recreate the memory of his mother.

As a government surveyor in Guyana, where he was born 80 years ago, he was known to disappear into the Amazonian rainforests with volumes of Hegel and Heidegger. He has lived in England since 1959, writing complex, philosophical, visionary novels that can be bewilderingly arcane yet also dazzlingly illuminating. His oeuvre runs to more than 20 works of fiction - beginning with Palace of the Peacock (1960) - and several volumes of essays. </p> <p>Guyana, unlike the Anglophone Caribbean islands with which it shares much of its history, has a South American landscape and an Amerindian presence. Harris is fascinated by both, an inspiration he shares with other Guyanese, such as the writer Pauline Melville and the late painter Aubrey Williams. His recent fiction is haunted by the ruins of pre-Columbian cities, and the mysterious abandonment of some of them before the conquest. </p> <p>Like his previous novel, Jonestown (1996), which was set in the aftermath of the mass suicide instigated by the Reverend Jim Jones in 1978, The Dark Jester takes its cue from a shard of history: the encounter between the Spanish conquistador Pizarro, who conquered Peru, and its last great Inca king, Atahualpa. Atahualpa is sentenced to be burned at the stake, but escapes through conversion to Christianity. Promised his freedom for a roomful of gold, he is betrayed by Pizarro and killed. </p> <p>Events unfold in a dream of the narrator, known as the Dreamer, creating a new perspective on the past. Harris is acutely aware of how the past lingers and can imprison the present, and of how this region's past in particular has been one of repeated conquest and catastrophe. The inadequacy or one-sidedness of recorded history lead him to myth, to intuitive re-creation and re-imagining. Like Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, also from South America's Caribbean coast, he abolishes linear time in favour of a cyclical reconstruction, an open dialogue with the past. </p> <p>The 20th-century Dreamer is a shape-shifting narrator, a vessel occupied in turn by Pizarro, a noble of Atahualpa, the prophet Laocoon and Tupac Amaru, Atahualpa's last heir. The landscape also mutates, as the pyramid of Palenque melts into a skyscraper, and the Dreamer envisions the volcanic upheavals that fashioned primordial hills, mountains and valleys millennia ago. There is no authoritative vantage point in the fiction of Harris, who rejects realism as blind to the imagination's \"parallel universes\". Rather, there are \"infinite rehearsals\", where every view is partial, and there is no final version. </p> <p>The novel is a meditation on the encounter between the materialist age ushered in by Pizarro, who sees only \"reptilian gold\" in the Incan art of Bird and Beast, and the lost civilisation of Atahualpa, son of the Sun. Pizarro, the \"King of Thieves\", becomes master of a slave ship where \"dark flesh is painted in Inca gold\" and the trade is in \"works of art that can labour, cut cane, create dams and canals\". Yet Harris acknowledges antecedents in both conqueror and victim. He sees creative possibilities in the impure mix, the promiscuous melding of world-views. </p> <p>The Dreamer is a prophet of the past, just as he has a \"memory of the future\", and the novel is filled with unheeded warnings - including the seeds of corruption sown long before Pizarro's advent and witnessed in the ruins of Macchu Picchu or Espiritu Pampa, and in the Incas' final rout. \"They were as unconscious of the dangers they faced as my century was of the undercurrents that threatened its existence,\" says the Dreamer. In the novel's climax, he encounters Cortez, passing on his way to conquer the Mexican Aztecs in 1519 - before Pizarro conquered Peru. The Dreamer tries to warn Cortez of the consequences of his quest; \"to warn him, or to kill him as a dictator whose deeds one foresees\". </p> <p>The Dreamer is accompanied in his adventures by the Jester, and among the novel's epigraphs are Milton's lines: \"Jesting decides great things / Stronglier and better / Oft than earnest can.\" Jest, Harris tells us, \"revises repetitions of something we take for granted\", breaking the \"ritual habit, ritual normality, that seals our eyes and ears\". The Dreamer sees the conquest as having set a seal on civilisation that must be broken and transfigured, to recover resources lost to \"conquistadorial ages\". The conquistador's descendant \"picks a word or two from here and there from ruined temples, a gesture or two here and there, a ritual or two, and sums up the psyche of a lost civilisation in terms that are imposed everywhere on the past, the present, and the future\". The novel is in part an attempt to intuit the spirit of the pre-conquest era other than through the eyes of its materialist conquerors, who deemed it a finished age - \"So finished it could be sold again, without insight, or understanding of the unfinished past, the unfinished present.\" </p> <p>Harris habitually links the myths and stories of diverse ages, with Caribbean culture emerging, as he says, from a \"complex womb\". Here, he finds echoes of King Priam's daughter, Cassandra, and the wooden horse in El Dorado, the \"Troy of the Americas\". Atahualpa's arrival at \"my age and time to die again, to live again\" recalls Christian redemption, while Prometheus mirrors the Incan ruler as son of the sun. There are also recurring motifs - of time's ladder, and the ship travelling through imaginative space. </p> <p>The juxtaposition of the abstractly philosophical and the sensuous can often be jarring, a crunching of gears in a shift from poetry to essay. But at moments, the marriage is profound. The Jester laughs soundlessly, \"like a gathering storm on a butterfly's wing\", or the Dreamer muses: \"How does one measure time and distance in the moment of dying? Does an inch bring a million, does a minute erase all the clocks?\" </p> <p>Harris's singular vision can result in a baffling privacy of meaning. Yet often he recalls Blake, with a prophetic vision that challenges and renews the senses and contorts the syntax. The Bird, he writes, \"sang in the faint orchestration of igneous words they seemed, survivor blood that stained its feathers in rare fire. The fire was so unnerving, so matchless, it created a sound that was red , a scarlet sound.\" Harris is a firm believer in the regenerative power of the imagination. Threading together the myths of different cultures, he creates his own. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.thecore.nus.edu.sg/landow/post/caribbean/harris/harrisov.html\" target=\"_NEW\">An introduction to Wilson Harris </a></p>",

The juxtaposition of the abstractly philosophical and the sensuous can often be jarring, a crunching of gears in a shift from poetry to essay. But at moments, the marriage is profound. The Jester laughs soundlessly, \"like a gathering storm on a butterfly's wing\", or the Dreamer muses: \"How does one measure time and distance in the moment of dying? Does an inch bring a million, does a minute erase all the clocks?\" Harris's singular vision can result in a baffling privacy of meaning. Yet often he recalls Blake, with a prophetic vision that challenges and renews the senses and contorts the syntax. The Bird, he writes, \"sang in the faint orchestration of igneous words they seemed, survivor blood that stained its feathers in rare fire. The fire was so unnerving, so matchless, it created a sound that was red , a scarlet sound.\" Harris is a firm believer in the regenerative power of the imagination. Threading together the myths of different cultures, he creates his own. An introduction to Wilson Harris",

Here, as previously, her subject is the tension between a first-generation Chinese-American woman and her awkwardly semi-assimilated mother. Tan is at once standing on the inside - the purveyor of secret histories and forgotten traditions - and shaking her head in bewilderment from without. </p> <p>When Ruth, the heroine of The Bonesetter's Daughter , asserts that her mother \"is not like other Chinese people\", she is both bemoaning LuLing's cussed individualism and pointing to her own sense of other ness. Is she herself \"like Chinese people\"? If not, what exactly is she? </p> <p>LuLing is not like other Chinese people; nor, in fact, like many other human beings one would care to meet. She stretches the reader's sympathy through a mixture of coercion, depression, manipulation and outright abuse. Reclining on her battered La-Z-Boy, she is \"a petulant child on a throne\"; as Alzheimer's begins to claim her, she is a child in need of ceaseless attention. </p> <p>How to give unstinting affection to a mother who, for as long as you can remember, has been depressed and angry, threatening suicide at the slightest incursion? At the novel's outset, Ruth, her mother's chief interpreter, aider, abetter and all- round whipping girl, faces the prospect of an increase in her dependence with a sinking heart. And yet for compliant Ruth, a ghostwriter whose days are spent coaxing into life books with titles like Internet Spirituality and Defeat Depression with Dogs while ministering to the needs of her New Man partner and his whiny teenage daughters, refusal is simply not an option. </p> <p>Tan is an efficient narrator of the undercurrents of mother-daughter relationships; she has a talent for small comic touches, but all too frequently they are deluged by a wave of explication. The first part of the book sags under the weight of Tan's earnestness, and Ruth's dilemma seems over-determined. Her annual period of muteness - which she ascribes variously to allergies, mould, viruses and psychic disturbance - is too clearly a novelistic symbol of choked emotions and repression. </p> <p>Where the novel really takes off is in its second section: a translation of \"things I should not forget\" discovered by Ruth in the seat of her mother's La-Z-Boy just as LuLing's grasp of language seems to falter irredeemably. Here we are treated to high drama that, paradoxically, has more verisimilitude than Ruth's domestic trials, despite its Mongol bandits, dragon bones, self-mutilation and suicide, and a broad historical sweep ranging from the archaisms of rural Chinese life to the terrors of the Japanese invasion and the civil war. Delivered to the reader as both pure, plotty adventure and a slowly unfurled tragedy, it provides a key to the present while reinforcing the mysterious unknowability of the past. </p> <p>Ruth's bizarre under-reaction to her mother's memoir is perhaps the novel's weakest point. \"It feels like I've found the magic thread to mend a torn-up quilt,\" she tells her partner, and that imagery - redolent of trite, homespun wisdom and ad-hoc reconciliation - is symptomatic of the cloying feel to some of Tan's writing. In the end, it is LuLing who is Tan's most ingeniously ambiguous creation. She alone appears to have a sense of the power she wields and of its dependence on the continuation of secrecy, as witnessed by her scornful rebuff to a doctor enthralled by Beijing's Forbidden City: \"In those day, so many thing forbidden, can't see.

      "body": "<p> Hey hey, they're the monkeys, ushering in the silly season a good three months early. This \"lo-fi thriller event\", as it said on the ticket, was proof that no matter how foolish the concept, it will sell tickets if a famous name is involved. The name in Gorillaz' case is moonlighting Blur boy Damon Albarn, who, with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, conceived the idea of a fictitious cartoon band, just 30 years after the Archies did it first. And despite clocking up a woozily catchy debut single, Clint Eastwood, it's silly indeed. Gorillaz are the indie answer to Hear'Say: a passably mammalian outfit concocted out of thin air and straight into the charts. </p> <p>Had Albarn been in doubt about his latest solo fling, he would have been reassured by the sight of the sold-out... well, \"event\" describes it as well as anything. The ticket promised that Gorillaz' made-up members (guitarist Noodle, rapper Russel and singers 2D and Murdoc) would be playing, but guess what? Being cartoons, they couldn't make it, so they sent their spokespeople: Albarn, San Francisco rapper Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and a milling cast of others. </p> <p>We had to take it on faith that they were actually there, though, as they played the whole set behind a screen. Albarn appeared only as a ghostly, baseball-capped silhouette. As he might have retorted to anyone who objected to paying for not seeing his face, it's art, innit? </p> <p>The music, mostly booming hip-hop and dub, with interludes of Song 2-style thrashing, was synchronised to the images on screen. The idea was that Albarn and friends were the soundtrack to the images, which ranged from horror-movie footage to Hewlett's Japanese-inspired graphics, all flashed at warp speed. Someone will undoubtedly come up with the ultimate audiovisual extravaganza one day, but Gorillaz' stab at it - pairing, for example, droning dub with a clip from The Mummy - isn't it. </p> <p>There was a whoop of relief for the first notes of Clint Eastwood, which they performed twice.

      "bodyText": "Hey hey, they're the monkeys, ushering in the silly season a good three months early. This \"lo-fi thriller event\", as it said on the ticket, was proof that no matter how foolish the concept, it will sell tickets if a famous name is involved. The name in Gorillaz' case is moonlighting Blur boy Damon Albarn, who, with Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, conceived the idea of a fictitious cartoon band, just 30 years after the Archies did it first. And despite clocking up a woozily catchy debut single, Clint Eastwood, it's silly indeed. Gorillaz are the indie answer to Hear'Say: a passably mammalian outfit concocted out of thin air and straight into the charts. Had Albarn been in doubt about his latest solo fling, he would have been reassured by the sight of the sold-out... well, \"event\" describes it as well as anything. The ticket promised that Gorillaz' made-up members (guitarist Noodle, rapper Russel and singers 2D and Murdoc) would be playing, but guess what? Being cartoons, they couldn't make it, so they sent their spokespeople: Albarn, San Francisco rapper Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and a milling cast of others. We had to take it on faith that they were actually there, though, as they played the whole set behind a screen. Albarn appeared only as a ghostly, baseball-capped silhouette. As he might have retorted to anyone who objected to paying for not seeing his face, it's art, innit? The music, mostly booming hip-hop and dub, with interludes of Song 2-style thrashing, was synchronised to the images on screen. The idea was that Albarn and friends were the soundtrack to the images, which ranged from horror-movie footage to Hewlett's Japanese-inspired graphics, all flashed at warp speed. Someone will undoubtedly come up with the ultimate audiovisual extravaganza one day, but Gorillaz' stab at it - pairing, for example, droning dub with a clip from The Mummy - isn't it. There was a whoop of relief for the first notes of Clint Eastwood, which they performed twice. A sequin-encrusted Del appeared briefly on a balcony, and that was it. Damon gets an A for effort, and for exploring different terrain with every new project, but Gorillaz are one bit of monkey business he'd be best off chalking up to experience.",

      "body": "<p>For five years now I have watched the vertiginous rise in the price of some film posters. In 1995 a poster from the James Bond film, From Russia With Love, sold for \u00a350. Last year it was worth between \u00a31,000 and \u00a31,500. Now it would probably sell for \u00a32,000. </p> <p>These prices come from Tony Nourmand who runs The Reel Poster Gallery in Notting Hill, London. He says: \"You can date the increase of interest in film posters as collectibles from 1995. This is when Christie's started holding their regular auctions. They have such a terrific publicity machine. They created an awareness that posters are available, relatively cheap compared to paintings and make good decorations.\" </p> <p>He might add that he has played his part in popularising film posters. His gallery is world-renowned. A great expert on the subject, he has written and contributed to a number of books on the genre. He also assembles collections for serious collectors and is a consultant to Christie's. </p> <p>So, what is new in this world, as Christie's comes up for its sixth annual auction next Tuesday and The Reel Poster Gallery publishes its fifth colour catalogue? </p> <p>When Christie's South Kensington creates a new niche, as it has done with James Bond memorabilia and ski posters, as well as film posters, it seems to ensure that the supply increases to meet demand. People read about prices that are realised and pieces start coming out of the woodwork. And this year's sale, which comprises more than 300 lots, includes two private collections that have never been on the market before, with some particularly rare pieces of cinema artwork. </p> <p>The introduction to the Reel Poster gallery's latest catalogue says: \"Throughout our four previous catalogues, no poster has been repeated, and we have maintained this policy for the fifth catalogue. In this catalogue we have included a rich variety of striking and intriguing posters from over 15 countries, including for the first time Romania, Denmark and Cuba.\" </p> <p>The field is definitely widening. So what are the categories most sought after and at what price? </p> <p>One popular area is science fiction and horror movies. The first collection at the Christie's sale has quite a few of these. They form part of a group of 65 one-sheet posters rediscovered almost 50 years ago in a garage in Arizona by the vendor and his father-in-law. The latter, who managed a movie theatre in Jerome, Arizona during the late 1920s and early 1930s, retrieved the posters when the theatre closed and could not bring himself to throw them away. When the posters were discovered they were glued to five pieces of cardboard. The theatre did not have display cases and the cardboard was propped against the walls to advertise the attractions. Now largely detached from the cardboard, the collection is expected to realise \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>Paramount's poster for Supernatural is expected to realise \u00a38,000 to \u00a312,000. From the same year (1933), a Universal Studios one sheet for Murders in the Zoo carries an estimate of \u00a33,500 to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The star attraction, however, is a Universal one-sheet poster for what is considered one of the classic horror films of all time, The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff. A poster for this film holds the record for any film poster. Some years back one sold for $450,000. At that time it was thought to be one of only two in existence (early film posters were not made to last). Now this third one has been discovered. However, as it is not in as good a condition as the earlier ones, the estimate is between \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000. </p> <p>Mr Nourmand says, as a rule of thumb, the more popular the film, the more popular the poster. Thus, anything from James Bond, the Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movies and spaghetti westerns and the Marx brothers are sought after. Also, certain directors, particularly Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, are collected. Leading ladies such as Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn are also sought after. And there is an interest in cult films and in well-known designers such as Saul Bass. </p> <p>In the other collection at Christie's a poster for the Marx Brothers classic Duck Soup (1933) is estimated at \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000. A Universal three sheet for The Seven Year Itch (1955) starring Marilyn Monroe is expected to realise up to \u00a35,000. </p> <p>From The Reel Poster Gallery catalogue, the original Alfred Hitchcock film of the famous John Buchan novel The 39 Steps has sold for \u00a315,000. But Mr Nourmand points out that the Irma La Douce poster in its catalogue went for \u00a3650. \"Prices here start at \u00a3300,\" he says. </p> <p>Sarah Hodgson, the specialist at Christie's South Kensington, agrees. \"Everyone talks about the James Bond poster, but many posters have risen steadily in price rather than dramatically. Many are affordable. Prices in our sale start at \u00a3200.\" </p> <p>\u0095 For further information: Christie's South Kensington, tel: 020 7581 7611 or visit <a href=\"http://www.christies.com;\">www.christies.com</a>.

Someone seeking advice on whether, for instance, a particular form of tax avoidance is a criminal offence might well get better advice from an accountant than a solicitor.

Relaxing these restrictions might allow more competition, but there is a genuine fear that large accountancy firms will end up dominating the legal services market. Of more immediate concern to consumers may be the charging recommendations made by some professional bodies. The Royal Institute of British Architects and the Law Society, in relation to probate work, both have scale charges, which many would argue are excessive.

The rules that prevent solicitors paying inducements to those who introduce clients are also found to be a fetter on competition. The report also questions the rule prohibiting barristers advertising their success rate, something few would wish to do, if only because of the impossibility of defining \"success\" in this context. </p> <p>The OFT even points out that banks have not been given much opportunity to enter the conveyancing market. Rules could be made under the Courts and Legal Services Act which would allow this. At present banks do undertake probate work, but there is no evidence to suggest they do it cheaper or better than solicitors. Allowing banks to do the legal work in buying houses is something many would find alarming. </p> <p>These are instances where anti-competitive practices may in fact be in the public interest. While the report deals comprehensively with competition matters, it does not appear to address public interest. Indeed, last autumn the consultants helping the OFT with the report told the Bar Council they had not been asked to carry out \"a full public interest assessment\".

The larger pieces were performed underneath a video of Henry Darger's bizarre paintings. Darger, who lived as a recluse in Chicago and died in 1973, made his life's work a vast narrative of words and pictures called The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinnian War Storm, as Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.

Armies of marauding adult males dressed in first world war costumes encroach on their pastoral idyll, shooting, crucifying and mutilating the children. The final image is of a starkly depopulated landscape. Darger's kitschy style, like a mix of manga, Japanese prints and children's illustrations, could not be further from Partch's ritualistic dissonance. Beyond their superficial lifestyle connections, it was difficult to see why these artists had been chosen for each other. The ensemble's performance only became involving at the end of their set, and Partch's singular vision was partially glimpsed. </p> <p>Joe Coleman's artwork dominated the second half, with music by the Clerks' Group, who sang works by Renaissance composer and murderer Carlo Gesualdo, and Glaswegian indie band the Delgados. In a technique developed from the comics of Robert Crumb and the drawings of Hans Bellmer, Coleman creates vast canvases that seethe with orgiastic depravity. Gesualdo's serene lamentations were transformed into disturbing soundtracks for the dead, damned, and decaying. </p> <p>What Coleman lacks is a sense of perspective, either painterly or emotional. The relentless horrors of his material soon became hackneyed and one-dimensional. But the Delgados' soundtrack for Coleman's Portraits series created a musical depth that counteracted the limitations of the paintings. Their music was an impassioned commentary on Coleman's dark pantheon of America's underworld, which included Ed Gein, the murderer who inspired The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, adolescent killers, and even Coleman himself. This final set succeeded where the rest of the concert failed - in creating moments of genuinely multimedia collaboration.</p>",

And the biggest number of stayaways may be the clients of discount financial advisers, reacting against Isa guides in which the only advice is for funds which have paid for adverts. </p> <p>Some independent financial advisors (IFAs), whose selling efforts are largely focused on printing and distributing millions of guides with midmarket newspapers, have seen business fall by half. </p> <p>Last year, many Isa investors were pushed into then-big-selling technology funds by the advert-dominated guides. One from IFA Elson Associ ates, paid for by five sets of ads from technology funds, said: \"The explosive growth in the technology sector has been matched by technology shares. They have massively outperformed world equity markets over the last few years and most experts predict similar dynamic growth in the years to come.\" </p> <p>But \"most experts\" were wrong.

      "bodyText": "Equity Isa sales are slumping, with many providers admitting sales have fallen by at least a third. And the biggest number of stayaways may be the clients of discount financial advisers, reacting against Isa guides in which the only advice is for funds which have paid for adverts. Some independent financial advisors (IFAs), whose selling efforts are largely focused on printing and distributing millions of guides with midmarket newspapers, have seen business fall by half. Last year, many Isa investors were pushed into then-big-selling technology funds by the advert-dominated guides. One from IFA Elson Associ ates, paid for by five sets of ads from technology funds, said: \"The explosive growth in the technology sector has been matched by technology shares. They have massively outperformed world equity markets over the last few years and most experts predict similar dynamic growth in the years to come.\" But \"most experts\" were wrong. The five funds featured, including the highly hyped Framlington NetNet and Gartmore Techtornado, have fallen by between two-thirds and three-quarters since their peak. No fund which did not pay for an advert appeared in the guide. \"This leading of investors up an ad-led garden path may be one reason for their disenchantment with guide-led advice,\" says one IFA who refuses to accept ads.

The main joke is that she is translated not merely into an ass but one with a furry male appendage. It gives her the chance to find unsuspected double entendres but robs her transition back to human form of its magic. The point is that Bottom has been entangled in a dream, not that a woman has found herself sporting an ass's member. </p> <p>For me the production misses the play's transfigurative strangeness. It is typical that Theseus's great speech on imagination is upstaged by the rearrangement of the furniture in his oddly restored house. In place of strangeness, we get high spirits. The Pyramus-Thisbe scene is nicely done - I particularly liked Debbie Chazen's revolving wall - and it is capped by an invigorating dance to a Benny Goodman swing number.

Last year the index of the UK's top 100 companies touched 7,000 points. Now there are queues of analysts willing to bet the market has further to fall and is likely to dive below 5,000 and keep going. </p> <p>Forget that many of them said last year the market was set to grow for ever and firms such as Lastminute.com would be worth billions of pounds. Analyst reports that gushed about promising dot.coms have long since been shredded. Today there are some hard realities to deal with. </p> <p>They point to a slowdown in the US economy that is rapidly turning into a recession.

Many are not first-time buyers and are nursing big losses from their investments last year in dot.com unit trusts like Framlington's NetNet fund and trusts that invested in media and telecoms stocks. </p> <p>But hang on, there's an old market saying that goes something like \"when there's blood on the carpet, that's the time to buy\". There are scores of subscribers to this strategy and many of them are the same analysts who predict further big falls in the market. They all predict a bounce back and reckon get ting back into the market before the end of the tax year, or sticking with it, is a sure fire hit. </p> <p>Unit trust manager Colin Morton of BWD Rensburg says the market is suffering from an over reaction to the dot.com debacle and further falls are likely. \"It is probably a good time to buy, even if this isn't the bottom of the market. You've just got to close your eyes and do it. The FTSE 100 might go down to 5,000 before it bounces back, but I would bet the market will be much higher than it is today in two years' time.\" </p> <p>Like Mr Morton, Neil Woodford spent last year refusing to believe that dot.coms had invented a new business model that justified multi-million pound valuations based on thousand pound turnovers. Mr Woodford, who manages \u00a33bn for small investors at Perpetual, was in the doghouse because Perpetual funds were refusing to buy the technology stocks that most other managers were jumping into. Twelve months later his High Income and Income funds are still up by 15-20% over the year when nearly everything else is down. He believes the current turmoil is overdone, and is very confident that the market will recover, though not in the technology sector. </p> <p>Mike Young of Goldman Sachs believes that shares are still overpriced. He says the trough in the market will be reached some time in the next six months and by next year the markets will be back on an upward track. </p> <p>The trouble for Isa buyers is that they can't wait that long. If they hold back until they see an upswing they will miss out on this year's allocation. Amanda Davidson of independent financial adviser Holden Meehan says that could be a mistake. She also recommends buying now. </p> <p>There are ways of minimising the volatility. </p> <p>One way is Fidelity's Funds Network fund supermarket (<a href=\"http://www.fundsnetwork.co.uk)\">www.fundsnetwork.co.uk)</a> and similar sites such as Wolverhampton-based IFA Torquil Clark's <a href=\"http://www.tqonline.co.uk,\">www.tqonline.co.uk,</a> which allow you to phase your investment. You hand over your Isa money now and it is divided into six equal chunks and drip-fed in over the next six months. While your money is waiting to be invested it is sitting in a cash account earning interest (which is taxed). </p> <p>More sophisticated investors might want to consider self-select Isas. With these, you buy individual stocks and shares instead of purchasing a unit trust or in vestment trust. Where they score during times of volatility is that you don't have to invest immediately - you can open one and hold your investment in cash for perhaps a few months until you are ready to buy. In the meantime your money earns interest, which is taxed. Self-select Isas tend to be the preserve of stockbrokers. Several online brokers offer them including iDealing.com (<a href=\"http://www.idealing.com),\">www.idealing.com),</a> E*Trade (<a href=\"http://www.etrade.co.uk)\">www.etrade.co.uk)</a> and DLJ Direct (&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.dljdirect.co.uk).\"</p> <p>Corporate\" TARGET=\"_NEW\"&gt;www.dljdirect.co.uk). </p> <p>Corporate bonds are usually seen as a safe haven during periods of market volatility. These are issued by companies as a method of borrowing money. Individuals can invest via corporate bond funds, and these are good for income-seeking investors - they will not give you capital growth over the long term, says Mike Attree at Torquil Clark. Investment brokers Allenbridge recommends the Norwich Union Higher Income Plus Fund, which has an income yield of more than 8%, and the Legal &amp; General Fixed Interest fund, which offers a yield of 6.6%. </p> <p>A new type of Isa invites small investors to put money into hedge funds, traditionally the preserve of the super-rich. They are being marketed as offering people the opportunity of making money whether stock markets are rising, falling or moving sideways. </p> <p>However the Financial Services Authority has warned investors to \"be wary\" of them. Several fund management firms including Jupiter, Deutsche Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston have introduced or are planning hedge fund Isas where the minimum investment is usually \u00a37,000. They are \"funds of hedge funds\" which means they invest people's money in several different hedge funds. </p> <p>There are also protected equity funds which typically might guarantee that if you invest and the market falls, perhaps 90%-95% of your capital will be protected and the most you could lose is 5%-10%. While most of the money you invest goes into equities a small portion is used to buy options. The options provide a safety net and cushion your fund's fall so the original investment is not lost. But the options are expensive to buy, and are even more costly at times of market volatility.</p>",

The trouble for Isa buyers is that they can't wait that long. If they hold back until they see an upswing they will miss out on this year's allocation. Amanda Davidson of independent financial adviser Holden Meehan says that could be a mistake. She also recommends buying now. There are ways of minimising the volatility. One way is Fidelity's Funds Network fund supermarket (www.fundsnetwork.co.uk) and similar sites such as Wolverhampton-based IFA Torquil Clark's www.tqonline.co.uk, which allow you to phase your investment. You hand over your Isa money now and it is divided into six equal chunks and drip-fed in over the next six months. While your money is waiting to be invested it is sitting in a cash account earning interest (which is taxed). More sophisticated investors might want to consider self-select Isas. With these, you buy individual stocks and shares instead of purchasing a unit trust or in vestment trust. Where they score during times of volatility is that you don't have to invest immediately - you can open one and hold your investment in cash for perhaps a few months until you are ready to buy. In the meantime your money earns interest, which is taxed. Self-select Isas tend to be the preserve of stockbrokers. Several online brokers offer them including iDealing.com (www.idealing.com), E*Trade (www.etrade.co.uk) and DLJ Direct ( \n<a>www.dljdirect.co.uk). Corporate bonds are usually seen as a safe haven during periods of market volatility. These are issued by companies as a method of borrowing money. Individuals can invest via corporate bond funds, and these are good for income-seeking investors - they will not give you capital growth over the long term, says Mike Attree at Torquil Clark. Investment brokers Allenbridge recommends the Norwich Union Higher Income Plus Fund, which has an income yield of more than 8%, and the Legal &amp; General Fixed Interest fund, which offers a yield of 6.6%. A new type of Isa invites small investors to put money into hedge funds, traditionally the preserve of the super-rich. They are being marketed as offering people the opportunity of making money whether stock markets are rising, falling or moving sideways. However the Financial Services Authority has warned investors to \"be wary\" of them. Several fund management firms including Jupiter, Deutsche Asset Management and Credit Suisse First Boston have introduced or are planning hedge fund Isas where the minimum investment is usually \u00a37,000. They are \"funds of hedge funds\" which means they invest people's money in several different hedge funds. There are also protected equity funds which typically might guarantee that if you invest and the market falls, perhaps 90%-95% of your capital will be protected and the most you could lose is 5%-10%. While most of the money you invest goes into equities a small portion is used to buy options. The options provide a safety net and cushion your fund's fall so the original investment is not lost. But the options are expensive to buy, and are even more costly at times of market volatility.</a>",

      "body": "<p>Britain has the worst record for uninsured drivers in Europe apart from Greece, according to a report this week from Direct Line, which claims that the cost could soon add \u00a360 to the average car insurance premium. </p> <p>Direct Line says the number of claims arising from accidents involving uninsured drivers has jumped from just \u00a339m in 1991 to \u00a3265m this year. It estimates that around one in 20 of the cars on Britain's roads today are not insured, compared to just one in 500 drivers on the autobahns of Germany. Only in Greece is the problem worse, where it is estimated that one in 10 drivers do not have insurance. </p> <p>Direct Line also challenged the government to raise fines on uninsured drivers. The maximum fine at present is \u00a35,000, but insurance companies say that magistrates courts typically fine drivers just \u00a3150, reduced to as little as \u00a335 for an early guilty plea. \"With average annual insurance premiums costing around \u00a3350, compared to typical fines for driving without insurance of \u00a3150, many drivers may think it is worth the gamble. Clearly fines are out of line with the cost of insurance,\" it says. </p> <p>In a survey carried out for Direct Line this week, one in 10 drivers said they know someone who is driving without insurance. Most want a crackdown on uninsured driving, with more police spot checks to catch culprits. A quarter said they want bigger fines and imprisonment for drivers who persistently flout the law. </p> <p>The cost of claims against uninsured drivers is borne by the Motor Insurers' Bureau. But the true cost is counted in lives wrecked by dangerous drivers, which studies show are more likely to be uninsured. </p> <p>Mary Williams, executive director of road safety organisation Brake, says: \"There is growing evidence that where a driver is stopped in a 30mph zone doing above 55mph, the majority are also uninsured. Bad drivers are often guilty of multiple offences; if they don't give a monkey's about insurance they usually don't give a monkey's about anything else.\" </p> <p>Brake says there should be a crackdown on uninsured drivers by a greater investment in traffic policing, which it says has fallen markedly in the past 10 years. </p> <p>Another solution, and one already popular on the continent, is for all cars to be legally obliged to carry an insurance disc on their car windscreens just above the car tax disc. But Direct Line, the biggest car insurer in the UK, is opposed to such a move. \"It doesn't stop uninsured drivers and is susceptible to fraud.\" </p> <p>Instead, Direct Line is part of an industry-wide new database, the Motor Insurance Database, which has cost \u00a312m to set up and which goes \"live\" on July 1 this year. </p> <p>Eventually the database should do away with the tedious practice - for both police and drivers - of having to present insurance documents at police stations for minor motoring offences. </p> <p>The database will hold insurance details on all 28m cars on Britain's roads, containing the policyholder's name and address, the vehicle make and model, dates of cover and a list of named drivers. All the police officer has to do is to check a car's licence plate against the database to reveal - in a matter of seconds - whether it is insured or not. </p> <p>Direct Line says the database will cut both uninsured driving and a paperchase at police stations, which it estimates costs the police \u00a320m-\u00a325m a year. \"About 75% of \"HORTI\" forms are issued to drivers whose documents are in order; that's a great deal of police time and effort wasted.\" </p> <p>Around 50,000 drivers in 1999 were involved in accidents with uninsured vehi cles. So what happens if you have a crash with a driver who does not carry insurance? </p> <p>Direct Line says the driver of the insured vehicle must first appoint a solicitor, which will be free if the driver has legal protection insurance. Secondly, once it is formally established that the third party has no insurance, the solicitor applies for a claim form from the Motor Insurers' Bureau. The bureau then investigates the claim and once it has decided that the uninsured party is liable, will go about assessing a payout in the usual way. The MIB will also seek to recover its costs from the uninsured driver, but admits that it rarely recovers much. </p> <p>But although the MIB acts as a protection against uninsured drivers, it doesn't mean that a crash with an uninsured driver is cost-free. </p> <p>A Direct Line spokesman says: \"No one is pretending that making a claim through the MIB is anything other than a long drawn-out process.\" </p> <p><strong>Buying a car is act of faith</strong></p> <p>Buying a secondhand car privately can be hazardous.

Many say they have failed to sign up a single client. The idea was that they would sell internet sites and facilities to small businesses. </p> <p>In November and December, audiences at presentations were told by sales director Peter Carbert: \"Get ready for the most awesome money-making opportunity you will ever see.\" </p> <p>He informed hopefuls at a London meeting that \"efor you.com is one of the biggest companies in the net that people have never heard of\"; that \"it has an expansion programme\"; and that \"the internet is the fastest growing business proposition around\". </p> <p>Eforyou was touted as \"the perfect opportunity with a fast return, unlimited growth, no start-up costs and no work\". </p> <p>According to a recent eforyou letter which the Guardian has seen, \"eforyou has reached its' (sic) recruitment targets\". These were set at 1,000 - suggesting the plan had netted some \u00a32.5m for its promoters. </p> <p>Now the main movers behind the plan - serial cash creating scheme entrepreneur Chris Douglas and Peter Carbert have bailed out. </p> <p>The original eforyou managing director, Chris Douglas, boasts a large house, a helicopter and a Porsche with personalised number plates. </p> <p>He has money making plans and publications such as The Secrets of Wealth from Pandora's Box, the Government Auction Handbook, the Wealth Handbook and recruiting for the now defunct Century Mortgages on his curriculum vitae. And his ventures have attracted adverse rulings from the Advertising Standards Authority. </p> <p>Peter Carbert was a director of Century Mortgages, when it was wound up by the Department of Trade and Industry in June 2000. Among grounds cited by the DTI for the Century closure were: </p> <p>Making false and misleading representations in its recruitment of licensees, particularly in relation to the overstatement of earnings; </p> <p>Failing to keep proper records, in particular to its dealings with associated businesses. </p> <p>Douglas and Carbert are currently pushing Herbalife, a US-based nutrition supplement sold through a multi-level, pyramid-style sales network via the Xotic Group, a firm they set up in January. </p> <p>But selling the Herbalife powders and pills, which are supposed to help the overweight to slim and the underweight to gain, is not the real object. Instead, Douglas and Carbert sign up \"opportunity seekers\" for \u00a32,600 packages. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Carbert told a London area audience that Herbalife was \"the most exciting thing Chris Douglas has ever seen in his life\". </p> <p>Eforyou.com has been forgotten. Douglas is no longer managing director. He has handed over that job to \"project manager\" David Henley. Henley also finds time to be a \"top Herbalife producer\". </p> <p>\"It's not pyramid selling,\" Carbert tells Herbalife hopefuls. He tells them that they could soon be earning an annual income of more than \u00a3340,000 - all they must do is to recruit five, who each recruit five who, in turn, each find five people, and so on. </p> <p>Although the rules governing these schemes say no one should be asked to pay more than \u00a375 in the first week - a form of cooling-off period - Carbert busies himself at meetings stressing the advantages of paying \u00a32,600 to join at \"supervisor\" level: the first link up the chain. </p> <p>Carbert, Douglas and others in Xotic gain \u00a3650 from each supervisor sale. Those who join at that level receive pills and potions with a \u00a34,000 retail value - if they manage to find buyers. </p> <p>Meanwhile, eforyou licensees are not letting their money go without a fight. \"The DTI needs to investigate this one, like it looked at Century. But it must move quickly before the cash is spent,\" says one disgruntled eforyou agent who wants to remain anonymous. </p> <p>\"I've lost \u00a32,500 so far. But I did better than most. I even managed to sell an internet site. But they weren't interested in this. The headquarters in Darlington just ignored me. They also gave me no help when the site buyer wanted to pull out. I've got personal integrity, I don't want a rip-off,\" he adds. </p> <p>Other eforyou licensees have been bombarding the firm with emails asking for their money back - or at least the \"money making opportunity\" that they were promised. </p> <p>Douglas did offer to come to an \"amicable settlement\" with some eforyou people. But so far, they have seen no sign of a refund. Attempts to stop personal credit card payments to the firm have failed. </p> <p>Two former eforyou agents, Andy Bignell and Nick Teahan, who made money sup porting Carbert at presentations, defected and started a lookalike set-up. So far, few others have opted for this. </p> <p>Earlier this week, Henley wrote to licensees to calm them. He said: \"It would appear a number of you are concerned at not being able to get through on the telephone lines... but not only is nothing wrong at head office, things have never been better.\" </p> <p>Now emails between eforyou agents suggest some are considering taking the law into their own hands if the DTI and trading standards continue to ignore their plight. </p> <p><strong>'I admit that greed got the better of us'</strong></p> <p>Chris Smith signed up for eforyou.com in December. He was promised big earnings from selling the wonders of the world wide web to small businesses. </p> <p>Along with partner Nikki Shaw, who works in closed circuit tv sales, car racing instructor Smith paid the \u00a31,000 deposit demanded. </p> <p>Chris says: \"I have to admit greed got the better of us. The earnings figures were huge compared to both our salaries. We both wanted to get out of the rat race. What we were offered seemed really good.\" </p> <p>Nikki's Christmas bonus part funded the eventual \u00a32,500 total. \"We've had to scrimp and go without luxuries for the rest which went on the credit card,\" Chris says. </p> <p>Now the Cheshire couple have nothing to show for their money. \"We were promised loads of leads. But we only ever had three - and all were useless. The whole organisation shut down for three weeks at Christmas. It was soon clear this was going nowhere,\" says Chris. </p> <p>Chris and Nikki wanted their money back. Their letters and phone calls were unanswered, so they went to eforyou's Darlington office four weeks ago. </p> <p>\"David Henley, the office manager [and now managing director] refused to talk to us. Karen Douglas, Chris Douglas's wife, promised a refund but just to get rid of us.\" </p> <p>Chris and Nikki complained to the DTI but have had no reply. Using credit card consumer protection rules failed. </p> <p>\"My plastic company refused our claim. It says the eforyou contract is vague, so there is nothing they can do. It will not risk not being able to get the money back. They said they could only pay if eforyou went bankrupt within 120 days of our first payment. </p> <p>\"We've lost money to an organisation which is useless at everything except promising big things and delivering nothing,\" Chris says.</p>",

He has money making plans and publications such as The Secrets of Wealth from Pandora's Box, the Government Auction Handbook, the Wealth Handbook and recruiting for the now defunct Century Mortgages on his curriculum vitae. And his ventures have attracted adverse rulings from the Advertising Standards Authority. Peter Carbert was a director of Century Mortgages, when it was wound up by the Department of Trade and Industry in June 2000. Among grounds cited by the DTI for the Century closure were: Making false and misleading representations in its recruitment of licensees, particularly in relation to the overstatement of earnings; Failing to keep proper records, in particular to its dealings with associated businesses. Douglas and Carbert are currently pushing Herbalife, a US-based nutrition supplement sold through a multi-level, pyramid-style sales network via the Xotic Group, a firm they set up in January. But selling the Herbalife powders and pills, which are supposed to help the overweight to slim and the underweight to gain, is not the real object. Instead, Douglas and Carbert sign up \"opportunity seekers\" for \u00a32,600 packages. Earlier this week, Carbert told a London area audience that Herbalife was \"the most exciting thing Chris Douglas has ever seen in his life\". Eforyou.com has been forgotten. Douglas is no longer managing director. He has handed over that job to \"project manager\" David Henley. Henley also finds time to be a \"top Herbalife producer\". \"It's not pyramid selling,\" Carbert tells Herbalife hopefuls. He tells them that they could soon be earning an annual income of more than \u00a3340,000 - all they must do is to recruit five, who each recruit five who, in turn, each find five people, and so on. Although the rules governing these schemes say no one should be asked to pay more than \u00a375 in the first week - a form of cooling-off period - Carbert busies himself at meetings stressing the advantages of paying \u00a32,600 to join at \"supervisor\" level: the first link up the chain. Carbert, Douglas and others in Xotic gain \u00a3650 from each supervisor sale. Those who join at that level receive pills and potions with a \u00a34,000 retail value - if they manage to find buyers. Meanwhile, eforyou licensees are not letting their money go without a fight. \"The DTI needs to investigate this one, like it looked at Century. But it must move quickly before the cash is spent,\" says one disgruntled eforyou agent who wants to remain anonymous. \"I've lost \u00a32,500 so far. But I did better than most. I even managed to sell an internet site. But they weren't interested in this. The headquarters in Darlington just ignored me. They also gave me no help when the site buyer wanted to pull out. I've got personal integrity, I don't want a rip-off,\" he adds. Other eforyou licensees have been bombarding the firm with emails asking for their money back - or at least the \"money making opportunity\" that they were promised. Douglas did offer to come to an \"amicable settlement\" with some eforyou people. But so far, they have seen no sign of a refund. Attempts to stop personal credit card payments to the firm have failed. Two former eforyou agents, Andy Bignell and Nick Teahan, who made money sup porting Carbert at presentations, defected and started a lookalike set-up. So far, few others have opted for this. Earlier this week, Henley wrote to licensees to calm them. He said: \"It would appear a number of you are concerned at not being able to get through on the telephone lines... but not only is nothing wrong at head office, things have never been better.\" Now emails between eforyou agents suggest some are considering taking the law into their own hands if the DTI and trading standards continue to ignore their plight. 'I admit that greed got the better of us' Chris Smith signed up for eforyou.com in December. He was promised big earnings from selling the wonders of the world wide web to small businesses. Along with partner Nikki Shaw, who works in closed circuit tv sales, car racing instructor Smith paid the \u00a31,000 deposit demanded. Chris says: \"I have to admit greed got the better of us. The earnings figures were huge compared to both our salaries. We both wanted to get out of the rat race. What we were offered seemed really good.\" Nikki's Christmas bonus part funded the eventual \u00a32,500 total. \"We've had to scrimp and go without luxuries for the rest which went on the credit card,\" Chris says. Now the Cheshire couple have nothing to show for their money. \"We were promised loads of leads. But we only ever had three - and all were useless. The whole organisation shut down for three weeks at Christmas. It was soon clear this was going nowhere,\" says Chris. Chris and Nikki wanted their money back. Their letters and phone calls were unanswered, so they went to eforyou's Darlington office four weeks ago. \"David Henley, the office manager [and now managing director] refused to talk to us. Karen Douglas, Chris Douglas's wife, promised a refund but just to get rid of us.\" Chris and Nikki complained to the DTI but have had no reply. Using credit card consumer protection rules failed. \"My plastic company refused our claim. It says the eforyou contract is vague, so there is nothing they can do. It will not risk not being able to get the money back. They said they could only pay if eforyou went bankrupt within 120 days of our first payment. \"We've lost money to an organisation which is useless at everything except promising big things and delivering nothing,\" Chris says.",

The practice is relatively new in Britain, where the City used to be run as an old boys' network in which everyone knew everyone else and a gentleman's word was his bond. But with the internationalisation of the financial sector and the growing importance of IT - all those blokes in systems can effectively eavesdrop on the boardroom - employee security has assumed far greater importance.

The biggest danger is that the lies will come back to haunt you - after all, it is easier to be consistent with the truth.

According to Nina Grunfeld, a career and life-change consultant, it doesn't pay to fire off a batch of CVs. Better by far to target a job or company, find out all you can about it, and write a one-off letter - whether or not there is a job going. </p> <p>If a CV is then demanded -and it usually is - it should be tailored to that particular job and be minimal, elegantly laid out on no more than two sides of paper, and with plenty of white space. \"Less is definitely more with a CV,\" she advises. \"Your CV needs to flirt, not to reveal all.

This remarkable concert, in which lieder singer Wolfgang Holzmair joined the Nash for a programme of miniatures, got to the heart of what makes Henze tick.

Only the agitprop was missing. </p> <p>The most revelatory work was perhaps the five Nachtst\u00fccke, played with a mixture of venom and penetrating sweetness by Jacqueline Shave and Ian Brown. The title is usually translated as \"nocturne\", but literally means \"night piece\" and was used by German romantic writers, notably Hoffmann, to designate a horror story. Henze's mingling of opalescence, lyricism and textural probing suggests Mahler's nocturnes and the queasy \"night piece\" that is Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire - though a sudden lurch into violence towards the end plunges us into a world in which gothic Weberian spooks briefly run riot. </p> <p>The Capriccio for solo cello conjures up yet another world - the sexual shenanigans of the Commedia dell'Arte. A tour de force for the Nash's cellist Paul Watkins, it opens by turning the cello into a guitar before swirling off into fleet-footed territory, elegant, profound and reminiscent of Mozart. The Piano Quintet self-consciously peers at Brahms, whose all-embracing humanity and classicism form a radical counter to Wagnerian nihilism and discursiveness. The swaying bell-like piano chords underpinning the work's structure also hint at Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, with its ambivalent multiplicity of sexual configurations. </p> <p>Sex is very much the subject of the two featured song cycles. The Three Snow Songs, from 1989, portray lovers in a cold climate. It's written for baritone and soprano (Holzmair was joined by the radiant Lisa Milne), giving them an aria each before their voices join in a lapping, Monteverdian duet, full of erotic harmonic clashes. The Five Neapolitan Songs celebrate both masculinity and the fluidity of male desire. They were written for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, whose mantle Holzmair has in many ways inherited. His voice, sweet as honey and wonderfully seditious, suits them to perfection.</p>",

Sex is very much the subject of the two featured song cycles. The Three Snow Songs, from 1989, portray lovers in a cold climate. It's written for baritone and soprano (Holzmair was joined by the radiant Lisa Milne), giving them an aria each before their voices join in a lapping, Monteverdian duet, full of erotic harmonic clashes. The Five Neapolitan Songs celebrate both masculinity and the fluidity of male desire. They were written for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, whose mantle Holzmair has in many ways inherited. His voice, sweet as honey and wonderfully seditious, suits them to perfection.",
