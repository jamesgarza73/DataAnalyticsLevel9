But it does strike me that the work has flaws, the most prominent being a disparity between subject matter and expression. Ever the teller of tales and the narrator of variants of tales, Birtwistle combines a re-enactment of the events leading to the Crucifixion with a variation on the theme explored by Dostoevsky in The Brothers Karamazov: the return of Christ to earth to confront the legacy of his church. Eleven of the disciples are summoned to a second Passover celebration in the year 2000 by an enigmatic female figure called Ghost, part mediator between humanity and divinity, part commentator after the fashion of a Greek chorus. Judas appears unannounced, provoking the hostility of the other disciples until Jesus himself arrives to intervene. </p> <p>Birtwistle's Judas is a tortured man, who acted out of the belief that God would reveal Christ's true nature as the Messiah by intervening to save his son on the cross. As the opera proceeds, however, it becomes apparent that Jesus's ultimate betrayer is not Judas but those who throughout history have acted vilely in Christ's name. The catalogue of Christianity's crimes builds up relentlessly - denial of the human body, the suppression of women, homophobia, racism, anti-semitism. The last is the ultimate atrocity for it is based on the denial of the fact that Christ himself was a Jew. \"The Holocaust,\" Jesus sings, \"shattered my heart.\" </p> <p>It is at this point that Birtwistle stumbles. The score contains some of the most lyrically beautiful music he has written to date. But as he contemplates the catastrophic legacy of Christianity his inspiration seems to falter. The outrage and grief central to Robin Blaser's libretto does not find its equivalent in the incantatory movements of the score. Birtwistle, of course, may be implying that music is incapable of conveying such a nightmare - but I for one would dispute that. </p> <p>Martin Duncan's production, hugely admired in Berlin, is a model of eloquent understatement, even though its central image - the disciples emerging in slow motion out of eternity into the present through a garishly lit time-tunnel - carries echoes, intentional or not, of Close Encounters of a Third Kind. Much of the singing is tremendous, with the voices of the disciples and the off-stage Chorus Mysticus blending to ravishing perfection. Susan Bickley and Thomas Randle are outstanding as Ghost and Judas respectively. Only William Dazeley, lacking charisma as Jesus, is a tiny bit disappointing. The conducting, from Birtwistle's regular collaborator Elgar Howarth, is on the cool side. The whole is an evening that never fails to excite the intellect, but only intermittently touches the heart. </p> <p> At Glyndebourne (01273 813813) until Friday, then tours.</p>",

Even putting in extra hours and cutting corners, you're still not going to deliver it all on time. Hopefully, this is a rare situation, but if you constantly lurch from crisis to missed deadline and back, there's something wrong with your workload. And for the sake of your self-esteem, your reputation at work and your health, you need to find out where the problem lies. </p> <p>\u0095 Take a step back and look at where your work comes from. Is it because all three of your managers expect work at the same time? Or maybe your workload has increased since a colleague left? Perhaps your unreliable office kit means you're losing hours of valuable time looking at a dormant PC? </p> <p>\u0095 When you've hit on the problem areas, talk to someone who can help. That doesn't mean moaning to your colleagues - talk to your boss or the personnel department and give them a written summary of the problem. Don't be emotional and never utter the words, \"I can't cope\". This is merely a business challenge which needs to be resolved, and the fact that you're doing just that shows that you can cope. </p> <p>\u0095 Suggest some solutions - would a temp help to cover a busy time, or could work be delegated elsewhere? Maybe some of those important deadlines are not really so important and could be moved? Would more reliable, up-to-date office equipment pay dividends? </p> <p>\u0095 If you're drowning because your managers refuse to prioritise your work, negotiate with the most approachable of them.

      "bodyText": "Most PAs know the sensation that hits you when you realise you simply can't do everything that's on your desk. Even putting in extra hours and cutting corners, you're still not going to deliver it all on time. Hopefully, this is a rare situation, but if you constantly lurch from crisis to missed deadline and back, there's something wrong with your workload. And for the sake of your self-esteem, your reputation at work and your health, you need to find out where the problem lies. \u0095 Take a step back and look at where your work comes from. Is it because all three of your managers expect work at the same time? Or maybe your workload has increased since a colleague left? Perhaps your unreliable office kit means you're losing hours of valuable time looking at a dormant PC? \u0095 When you've hit on the problem areas, talk to someone who can help. That doesn't mean moaning to your colleagues - talk to your boss or the personnel department and give them a written summary of the problem. Don't be emotional and never utter the words, \"I can't cope\". This is merely a business challenge which needs to be resolved, and the fact that you're doing just that shows that you can cope. \u0095 Suggest some solutions - would a temp help to cover a busy time, or could work be delegated elsewhere? Maybe some of those important deadlines are not really so important and could be moved? Would more reliable, up-to-date office equipment pay dividends? \u0095 If you're drowning because your managers refuse to prioritise your work, negotiate with the most approachable of them. Explain calmly that, given the timescales, tasks x, y and z will not all be delivered on time and which would they like first? \u0095 Have a look at your time management, too. Track down your common time-wasters - be they people interrupting, constant shuffling through papers or maybe even your boss - and resolve to deal with them.

This staging has always been mildly controversial for it comes burdened with a design concept that laces gothic with mescaline. Yet even so, the production seems a good choice to launch Dowell's final season with the company for it sends out such confident signals as to how things have changed during his tenure. </p> <p>The dancing has indisputably got better. In 1987, when Swan Lake opened, The Royal barely had two ballerinas who could dance the great Odette/Odile role. This autumn it is fielding seven. In 1987 the rank and file of the company were ragged; 13 years later the company perform as if they had a claim to world-class status. </p> <p>Not that Friday's performance was a landmark event - the first show of a new season is often blunted by nerves. But it was assured and in parts impressive. The four cygnets zipped through their frenetic showstopper with aplomb: Zenaida Yanowsky stuck a note of eerie grandeur as one of the Big Swans and Elizabeth McGorian's Queen hinted at some really interesting damage in her relations with Prince Siegfried. The contemptuous glance she threw at her son's sybaritic friends and the steely calculation with which she assessed Siegfried's potential fiancees were blood-curdling. And best of all was Belinda Hatley in the pas de trois, combining gaiety and elegance in a performance that was pure style. </p> <p>The major focus was Darcey Bussell, who as Odette/Odile gave one of the oddest but most interesting performances of her career. Technically, her credentials to dance this dual role are a given, yet she seems intent on sacrificing its traditional lyric beauties and scintillating displays for something more willed. Her Odette, during much of act two, is a wild creature, as wary and feral as Fokine's Firebird. In the edgy use of her head, eyes and hands and in the staccato emphases of her phrasing Bussell sometimes bucks the music strangely. Yet all the time she shows Odette resisting Siegfried's love, resisting the pain of feeling human. The moment at which Odette pushes down her uplifted \"wings\", forcing them to become human arms, has rarely been so potent. </p> <p>As Odile, Bussell doesn't instantly turn on the sexual glitter, but starts out as a cynical blank barely bothering to respond to Siegfried. Only as she absorbs the advice of the magician Von Rothbart does she gradually start to seduce the prince. Roberto Bolle's Siegfried is in a blander mould than Bussell but he is a tender and focused partner. Bolle is, however, only a guest with the company, and one of the issues Dowell has never managed to resolve is finding Bussell a permanent partner. </p> <p> In repertory until December 2.

This book is the story of the princess and the penile substitute. Or rather - for fear I might have made you want to read it - one paragraph tells that short, sadly pointless story. The rest is about the princess and a pea-brained employee who fawned on her, forgave her trespasses, cried for her and now seeks to profit from defaming her. </p> <p>Back, however, to the dildo. Diana, Jephson breathlessly confides, returned from Paris in 1992 sporting a souvenir - 'a large, pink, battery-powered vibrator'. By now she knew she'd never get her hands on an orb or sceptre: this plastic knob would have to do. It had 'the aim', Jephson notes with courtly tact, 'of raising royal morale at critical moments'. But he denies that it was actually aimed at the critical royal part, and insists it was 'never used for its designed purpose'. Eventually Dodi assumed the role of royal morale-booster, which made the cheeky pink chap redundant. </p> <p>Meanwhile, it's curious that Diana should have felt she needed this bulbous, buzzing personal attendant. After all, she already had Jephson, who was her private secretary during the decade covered by his book, and he saw himself as a dildo in a pin-stripe suit. When he took the job, a courtier seasoned in sycophancy warned him: 'To these people you're just a toy. They'll wind you up and watch you whizz all over the place, then they'll throw you away and get another one.' </p> <p>Jephson prided himself for a while on being Diana's 'current favourite toy', and even aspired to function as a marital aid - rather than a bureaucratic aide - for the estranged Waleses. A few days after Diana acquired the dildo, Jephson smarmed into Charles's office to remind him: 'I joined this household to serve both Your Royal Highnesses.' But Charles had mentally metamorphosed himself into a snuggly sanitary pad, and Jephson's ministrations could hardly be counted on, since his batteries were starting to go flat.</p> <p>He resigned in 1996, petulant about Diana's secret Panorama interview. That, at least, is how he tells it. In fact, Diana executed him electronically by sending him a malevolent anonymous message on his pager. Jephson could no longer claim to be her best-beloved toy, her faithful and indefatigable stand-by; she had reduced him to the size of the transistorised gadget which stirred to life in his trouser pocket. Life, alas, would never be quite so vibrant again. </p> <p>Jephson piously professes to regard Diana as 'a global force for good', though his account of her kills the poor woman all over again. The charities she adopted, he makes clear, were excuses for foreign junkets; she used public money to subsidise her career as an 'independent celebrity'. Her temper was vile, her humour crude, and her laugh asinine. Jephson, impeccably proper, winces when her braying reaches 'the delicate ears of outsiders such as Queen's Flight crews'. </p> <p>Despite her global frolics, Diana hadn't the foggiest about the destinations to which her private planes - jet-propelled vibrators, if you come to think of it - were headed. At the White House just before the Gulf War, George Bush p\u00e8re asked her about the invasion of Kuwait. The opinion she vouchsafed was a meditative 'Um'. Jephson rejoices in her embarrassment, but reserves his haughtiest outrage for a more clandestine vice, her addiction to chocolate. 'I frequently watched her eat a whole bar of fruit-and-nut between engagements,' he reveals, and pauses to listen to us gasp. </p> <p>He is slavishly discreet, by contrast, about the elder Windsors, who are alive and liable to sue. Reneging on his contract to supply title-tattle, he opaquely paraphrases their dialogue. Charles, infuriated by Diana's refusal to spend a weekend at Sandringham, expressed his annoyance - Jephson informs us - 'in blunt and peremptory tones'. We are left to imagine the four-letter words the heir actually used. The evasion is characteristic of this cowardly book, too hyprocritically high-minded to get down to its job of scandal-mongering. </p> <p>Though he disdains his mistress, Jephson has a lofty opinion of himself. Describing how he supported Diana against her detractors at St James's Palace, he positively glows as the memory of his chivalry: 'If all this sounds rather overprincipled, then it probably was.' He admires the Queen's stoical immunity to emotion, and boasts of sharing it: between them, they uphold 'so many of the great British strengths which had withstood all the tests that Empire and war could bring'. He is also deeply, nauseatingly religious. When Diana jabs him with that message on his pager, he 'told nobody of my agonised thoughts except God. He had heard most of it before'. Now, thanks to Jephson's book, God generously shares this privileged information with everyone who reads a tabloid. </p> <p>Unplugged by the princess, Jephson apparently 'decided to take up writing'. He had served his apprenticeship ghosting thank-you notes for Diana, so he is proficient at ornately arranging clich\u00e9s. She and Charles, exchanging insults, remind him of pots and kettles. She wants to have her cake and eat it, while sipping from a poisoned chalice. Jephson adds a pinch of salt when she gossips about her adulterous in-laws. For a while, she rides the crest of a wave, though a straw finally breaks the camel's back.</p> <p>Sometimes, Jephson makes his catchphrases copulate. Thus the last meeting between the separate staffs of the Waleses is 'the merest fig leaf, the fag end of a process'. Just try to picture that: a fag posing as a fig. The vibrator rears its pert head on page 267. Otherwise, there is no reason at all to read this empty, imperceptive and crassly opportunistic book.</p>",

Writing the book has involved painful recognition of the prejudices she grew up with in Belfast and had not yet shed in 25 years in England. She is professor of modern history and director of the Institute of Irish Studies at Liverpool University. </p> <p>As far as this forceful book is concerned, recognition of the distinctiveness of Ulster Catholics, and even the difference between Catholics living in the east and west within Northern Ireland, is crucial to political progress. 'I have always felt different from Catholics elsewhere in Ireland and this is a common feeling among Ulster Catholics. Yet I have found them consistently neglected in the histories of Ireland and of Irish Catholicism in particular, as if Irishness and Catholicism so dominated their sense of themselves that they could be safely included with all other Irish Catholics... if that had been so, we would not have been left with that overwhelming sense of insecurity which is such a feature of the Ulster personality.' </p> <p>The scarring of the psyche has influenced Ulster's Catholics - Professor Elliott reclaims the old Irish kingdom name, 'Ulster', recognising the political sensitivity since Unionists use it for six-county Northern Ireland - and deepened their innate conservatism in their response to the Irish state, to their church and to segregated education. </p> <p>Her history shows the distinctiveness pre-dating partition in 1921 and rooted in early migrations and alliances. She recognises the horrors of the potato famines, but points to complexities beyond the demonology. By implication, even if only as cousins, northern Catholics are different from most Catholics who regard their Irish extraction as crucial to their make-up, particularly those in the United States. </p> <p>This is the nub of the difference between Elliott and the author of a second book on Catholics from Ireland, the journalist-turned-historian, Tim Pat Coogan, whose <strong> Wherever Green is Worn</strong> is a rollicking trawl looking at the fate of migrants, including those during the potato famines. Important among their descendants are the influential Irish-Americans affecting US involvement in the peace process. What Coogan very definitely does not do is identify Northern Ireland Catholics as different. </p> <p>Coogan, who has written two serious biographies, of Michael Collins and of Eamon De Valera, as well as a history of the IRA, trawls from the US via Britain to Japan looking at the Orange and Green tensions. His stock-in-trade is the hard-done-by, hard-drinking Irish Catholic and the patronising British colonial. Stereotypes last, he says, if they are founded in truth. </p> <p>The two authors are both deeply critical of the Catholic Church, Elliott for its political dealings in Northern Ireland, Coogan for its failure to care for the migrants. Coogan is outspoken in his criticism of the Dublin and London governments, although inevitably the British get more stick. </p> <p>Both authors recognise that the fact the Catholics are growing as a proportion of the population of Northern Ireland is vital, but here they divide. Elliott, whose family still lives in north Belfast, recalls rioting by loyalists that followed a mistaken report in 1991 that Catholics would shortly outnumber Protestants. Every word of her book is tempered to warn against triumphalism. </p> <p>Coogan, who refers to his own emotional background as a little boy watching the pathetic parade of migrants through Dun Laoghaoire, also worries about the effect of Catholic expansion in numbers and wealth on the Protestant psyche, but he cannot resist an epilogue saying: 'One day the sheer energy of the Celts... will subsume the present Unionist majority.' </p> <p>Coogan's book, woven throughout though it is with fascinating nuggets, falls on that sentence. Sadly, with its sexy cover showing migrants crowding under the White Star sign and its clear spin for a US readership, it is the one that will influence before Elliott's equally readable work. Her elegant grey cover says 'serious reader'. The less serious should not be put off.</p>",

Coogan's book, woven throughout though it is with fascinating nuggets, falls on that sentence. Sadly, with its sexy cover showing migrants crowding under the White Star sign and its clear spin for a US readership, it is the one that will influence before Elliott's equally readable work. Her elegant grey cover says 'serious reader'. The less serious should not be put off.",

They tell of lives casually undone by predictable circumstance and they do so with a grace and a rhythm so long taken to heart that it seems second nature. </p> <p>The title story is typical.

      "bodyText": "The Hill Bachelors William Trevor Viking \u00a315.99, pp256 Buy it at BOL These are stories that bear the imprint of habit. They tell of lives casually undone by predictable circumstance and they do so with a grace and a rhythm so long taken to heart that it seems second nature. The title story is typical. On the death of his father, a hill farmer, the youngest of three sons, returns to the bleak fields of his childhood. He comes back, the only unmarried son in the family, to be by his mother's side, and in the pressing knowledge that his life, which had promised something in the town, will now also be lived on this hillside. As he reclaims his father's fields from the bog, yard by yard, his inheritance closes in on him in inexorable detail - 'He naturally would know that times were bad, neither sheep nor cattle fetching what they were a year ago, everything gone quiet, the way you'd never have believed it' - until he is himself reclaimed by his fate. This story, in common with nearly all the stories in this word-perfect collection, takes two people and examines the connections and the dislocations between them, the ways in which ordinary lives are quietly shaped by chance and missed opportunity. Trevor is a great dissector of intimacy and here he turns the same sharp, humane attention in one tale to Vera and Sidney, bound in an unconsummated 30-year love by a grim secret buried in their past, and in another to the odd congress between a young man and a woman who meet for the first and last time in a restaurant. The woman's husband has fallen down drunk and the young man assists her in carrying him back to her bedroom. Trevor long ago staked his imagination's claim to dual nationality: his fiction commutes between the blustery lives of rural Ireland, the places of his childhood, and the stiffer formality of small-town England, his adoptive home. But while Trevor's territory remains constant, his understanding of the unravelling of relationships in these places, by these places, is being constantly refined. Where there is humour, as in 'Death of a Professor', which is a high-table tale of a man whose obituary appears prematurely in the papers, and who finds his life's work squashed between larger notices about a 'backing singer in a pop group and a bishop, born in Stockport', then it invariably bleaches into something more poignant. The most remarkable of these stories, 'The Telephone Game', works as a metaphor for Trevor's quiet, affecting vision. On the night before their wedding, a young couple - she German, he English - embark on a game involving calling strangers, playing tricks. The man, for a laugh, sends an elderly woman he doesn't know up into her attic to check her water tank, having warned her of floods. She fails to return, and in the silence on the end of the line the couple suddenly hear all their fears about their impending life together crackling. For all the cosy-seeming certainties on the surface of his prose, this kind of echoing emptiness is never far from the lives of the people William Trevor creates. They sometimes seem contented, but mostly they are, like this couple, left to wonder about the lives of others, hoping against hope for the 'far-off rattle of a human voice, faint and small.'",

      "body": "<p><strong> Civilisations </strong><br>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto<br>Macmillan \u00a325, pp636</p> <p>Once, 'civilisation' was an easy word. It was about how you held your tea-cup, treated your captive, scanned your Alexandrine or flushed away your excrement. Now the term has fallen apart, its fragments stained with subjectivism. As Felipe Fernandez-Armesto says: 'All definitions seem vitiated... I am civilised, you belong to a culture, he is a barbarian.' </p> <p>He is the most urbane of historians. This is one of those fashionable encyclopaedia-scale tomes (and he has written a few before), but whenever the going gets tough the author jumps forward to charm his reader: witty, sometimes sharply original, often in a gust of rage. Felipe has no patience with prayerful stuff about Western Christian civilisation. 'We Western Europeans are the dregs of Eurasian history and our lands are the sump into which that history has drained.' So is the civilisation word worth keeping at all? And if it is, how should we use it? </p> <p>Felipe (for short, but not for lack of respect) admits that it is a 'Western' word. The imperial connotations - 'I am civilised, they are barbarians' - simply cannot be rinsed out of it. So why use it when, as he says himself, 'a society' or 'a culture' would do the job better? He derides so-called 'polythetic' definitions of civilisation which set up a checklist of attributes such as cities, writing, metallurgy, division of labour and so on. But then, arbitrarily enough, he selects his own definition. Civilisation is what can happen when humans significantly change their environment: 'a relationship between one species and the rest of nature'. </p> <p>So the book is divided up into environments (the wastelands of 'desert, tundra, ice', the grasslands, the rain-forests, the mountain plateaux and valleys, the alluvial river-lands and so forth), and into accounts of how human beings managed or failed to transform their landscapes and seascapes. This is why the book does not run chronologically, until the final eruption of European culture and settlement across the globe forces an inevitable climax. </p> <p>The borderline for Felipe runs between societies which adapt themselves to their surroundings and those which adapt their surroundings. For instance, the medieval Scandinavian settlers who arrived in Greenland established farms on the wintry barrens and built churches of local stone, but the Thule people who entered the region at around the same time came with light umiak boats and hunted over the ice with dog-teams. Ancestors of the Inuit, they survived climatic changes in this extreme environment, while the ambitious and landscape-refashioning European colony did not. </p> <p>Simply to adapt and stay alive in tundra, swamp or desert may be a much more remarkable achievement than building a city among temperate woodlands. Felipe cites the horrible environment of Frederik Hendrik Island, off New Guinea, a sludge of mud and mosquitoes in which humans improbably invented a sustainable way of living on artificial mounds elaborately layered and manured for a variety of crops. And yet swamps no less repellent generated some of the first urban cultures in Central America. </p> <p>Civilisations is anything but a hymn to progress. Felipe insists that there is nothing necessarily virtuous or inevitable about changes in material culture. 'If the environment works for you, why fix it?' He quotes the agronomist Jack Harlan, who pointed out the apparent senselessness of moving from a hunter-gatherer economy to settled agriculture. Hunter-gatherers were healthier, less vulnerable to the weather and worked much less hard. In the same way, the Industrial Revolution saw millions of people exchange a bad rural life for a far worse life in the new cities. It doesn't help to use the word 'advance' to describe these changes, as if the shift to greater complexity were planned. </p> <p>Maybe intensive agriculture did not begin as an innovation for feeding more people, but started as a religious rite to do with death and the earth. Maybe the people who landed up in alluvial flood-plains arrived as unwilling refugees from lost hunting-grounds; they may have built drainage channels and dams simply to protect themselves, and only later discovered that these could be used to irrigate huge and regular crops. </p> <p>Felipe never allows himself to grow bored with his material. None the less, a historian so lively is bound to find some tracts of world history less exciting than others. His sections on the classical world miss some targets. Surely it would have suited his 'relationship with nature' thesis to discuss how Black Sea dried fish made the Graeco-Roman empires possible. And what about the theory that those empires only happened because the early city-states exploited the fragile Mediterranean soils to death and were forced to expand into Gaul, North Africa or the Levant?</p> <p>The author's archaeology can be a bit dated too. Diffusionism (the idea that all cultural developments radiated from a single centre by migration or conquest) has not been 'orthodoxy' for a long time. And why does he use the archaic Wade-Giles spelling for Chinese names? </p> <p>He is at his best in three places: the medieval African states of the Sahel, the opening-up of the Atlantic and the history of the Indian Ocean. 'The precocity of the Indian Ocean as a zone of long-range navigation and cultural exchange is one of the glaring facts of history', made possible by the 'reversible escalator' of the monsoons. Roman, Chinese and Arab trading fleets cruised between the opulent coastal cities of the region, which remained a 'civilised' zone until Vasco da Gama smashed his way into it in 1498. (I cannot understand why Felipe is so charitable to this brutish terrorist.) Soon the coastal states of Europe learnt to 'crack the code' of the Atlantic winds, and a new 'Western' culture arose on both sides of the ocean. </p> <p>But in the twentieth century that 'Atlantic civilisation' discharged an avalanche of cruelty and destruction. Asking himself 'why progress failed', Felipe suggests that the failure is almost as much an illusion as progress itself. The truth was that human beneficence had been badly over-estimated. And at the end of this long display of learning and passionate intelligence, he sums up: 'If you misrepresent civilisation as progressive, you are bound to disappoint people... scratch it and savagery bleeds out.'</p>",

For instance, the medieval Scandinavian settlers who arrived in Greenland established farms on the wintry barrens and built churches of local stone, but the Thule people who entered the region at around the same time came with light umiak boats and hunted over the ice with dog-teams. Ancestors of the Inuit, they survived climatic changes in this extreme environment, while the ambitious and landscape-refashioning European colony did not. Simply to adapt and stay alive in tundra, swamp or desert may be a much more remarkable achievement than building a city among temperate woodlands. Felipe cites the horrible environment of Frederik Hendrik Island, off New Guinea, a sludge of mud and mosquitoes in which humans improbably invented a sustainable way of living on artificial mounds elaborately layered and manured for a variety of crops. And yet swamps no less repellent generated some of the first urban cultures in Central America. Civilisations is anything but a hymn to progress. Felipe insists that there is nothing necessarily virtuous or inevitable about changes in material culture. 'If the environment works for you, why fix it?' He quotes the agronomist Jack Harlan, who pointed out the apparent senselessness of moving from a hunter-gatherer economy to settled agriculture. Hunter-gatherers were healthier, less vulnerable to the weather and worked much less hard. In the same way, the Industrial Revolution saw millions of people exchange a bad rural life for a far worse life in the new cities. It doesn't help to use the word 'advance' to describe these changes, as if the shift to greater complexity were planned. Maybe intensive agriculture did not begin as an innovation for feeding more people, but started as a religious rite to do with death and the earth. Maybe the people who landed up in alluvial flood-plains arrived as unwilling refugees from lost hunting-grounds; they may have built drainage channels and dams simply to protect themselves, and only later discovered that these could be used to irrigate huge and regular crops. Felipe never allows himself to grow bored with his material. None the less, a historian so lively is bound to find some tracts of world history less exciting than others. His sections on the classical world miss some targets. Surely it would have suited his 'relationship with nature' thesis to discuss how Black Sea dried fish made the Graeco-Roman empires possible. And what about the theory that those empires only happened because the early city-states exploited the fragile Mediterranean soils to death and were forced to expand into Gaul, North Africa or the Levant? The author's archaeology can be a bit dated too. Diffusionism (the idea that all cultural developments radiated from a single centre by migration or conquest) has not been 'orthodoxy' for a long time. And why does he use the archaic Wade-Giles spelling for Chinese names? He is at his best in three places: the medieval African states of the Sahel, the opening-up of the Atlantic and the history of the Indian Ocean. 'The precocity of the Indian Ocean as a zone of long-range navigation and cultural exchange is one of the glaring facts of history', made possible by the 'reversible escalator' of the monsoons. Roman, Chinese and Arab trading fleets cruised between the opulent coastal cities of the region, which remained a 'civilised' zone until Vasco da Gama smashed his way into it in 1498. (I cannot understand why Felipe is so charitable to this brutish terrorist.) Soon the coastal states of Europe learnt to 'crack the code' of the Atlantic winds, and a new 'Western' culture arose on both sides of the ocean. But in the twentieth century that 'Atlantic civilisation' discharged an avalanche of cruelty and destruction. Asking himself 'why progress failed', Felipe suggests that the failure is almost as much an illusion as progress itself. The truth was that human beneficence had been badly over-estimated. And at the end of this long display of learning and passionate intelligence, he sums up: 'If you misrepresent civilisation as progressive, you are bound to disappoint people... scratch it and savagery bleeds out.'",

      "body": "<p>'It was as if we had beaten a country, more than just a football team,' writes Diego Maradona in his new autobiography. 'Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was a revenge.' </p> <p>Like so much else in Yo soy el Diego (I am Diego), the account of Argentina's victory over England at the 1986 World Cup is fresh. 'Sometimes I think that everything in my life has been filmed,' writes Maradona, 'that all my life is in the magazines. And yet it isn't so.' Indeed not. This book reveals a different Maradona to the footballing Saddam Hussein of British perception. </p> <p>On Friday Maradona turns 40. He is expected to die soon. In Cuba he has ample free time. Perhaps for these reasons, he has told two Argentinian journalists the story of his life. </p> <p>The autobiography, which has an initial print run in Argentina of 150,000, is due to appear in 80 countries. Last month Maradona flew to Buenos Aires to promote it. Looking thinner than usual, he inveighed against hunger and poverty in Argentina, and after a few days received a phone call from Fidel Castro, who said, simply: 'Come back.' Maradona went. </p> <p>But in Argentina he is still everywhere. 'Marad\u00f3n!' the crowd began chanting at the end of the depressing international against Uruguay a fortnight ago. His face appears a dozen times on every newspaper kiosk, and the radios that play non-stop in Argentine houses assault you several times hourly with the singer Rodrigo's ode, La mano de Dios (Hand of God): </p> <p><em>In a shanty town he was born,</em> <br> <em>It was God's will </em></p> <p>The shanty town of Villa Fiorito, well-documented as it is, was never so clear as in this account. The eight Maradona siblings growing up in one room; when it rained, more water inside the house than outside; the turquoise corduroys that were his only pair of trousers; his father working from four in the morning until three in the afternoon. </p> <p>'It wasn't easy, eh? Nothing was easy,' says Maradona. </p> <p>It helps you understand why Maradona was perennially transporting an army of friends, relatives, and casual bystanders around the world. Snooty Catalonia was appalled when they all turned up in Barcelona in 1982, but Maradona delights in giving things to people. In the book he recounts the first time he took his family to the beach, the day he asked his father to stop working, and the Maradona family's first visit to Disneyworld (or Disneyland; he isn't quite sure). </p> <p>Yet it was tough. He made his professional debut at 15, his international debut at 16, and by 19 had scored 100 league goals. 'I knew the jealousy of the others... I locked myself in my room and cried. I wanted to buy everything. Nobody can imagine what was happening to me then... Like everything in my life, things were going too fast.' Very early in his career he began dreaming of playing only with boys, against boys, in a stadium where all the fans, the stewards and policemen were boys. </p> <p>His first World Cup, in 1982, is a deception. Maradona is mediocre, is kicked to pieces, and is sent off against Brazil for kicking the bearded Batista in the balls. As the book reveals, he got the wrong man. 'What few people know is that that kick was meant for Falcao.' </p> <p>All of Argentina is upset, but Maradona says: 'In our country there are many more important things than Maradona.' The military regime, for instance, which in 1982 still runs the country. Even today it repels him. </p> <p>But as he reminds us, when the moment came he shook the hand of General Videla, the dictator. </p> <p>He also cheerfully reveals himself as the Iago of international football. His spur, he tells us frequently, is revenge. At 17, omitted from Argentina's squad for the World Cup of 1978, he swears revenge; when an opposing goalkeeper calls him chunky and overrated, he puts four goals past him; after the World Cup of 1982, he swears revenge for the next World Cup; and there, confronting England, he avenges the Malvinas. </p> <p>He recounts that dribble through the England defence second by second. </p> <p>As he advances down the right of the field, beating Beardsley, Reid and Butcher, he can see his team-mate Jorge Valdano in space to his left. Then, however, Terry Fenwick arrives. 'He wouldn't leave me!' Maradona recalls. 'If Fenwick had left me, I could have given it to Valdano, who would have been alone in front of Shilton. But Fenwick didn't leave me! He kept me a terrible guard, Fenwick!' </p> <p>Finally Maradona shakes him off by feinting inside and going outside. Appearing in front of Shilton, he experiences a flashback. Six years before, at Wembley, he had likewise dribbled through the whole of the England defence, but faced with Ray Clemence, had shot wide. At the time, his seven-year-old brother 'El Turco' (The Turk; most people in the book are known only by their nicknames; both God and Fidel Castro are The Beard) had phoned him to say: 'Bollocks! If you had feinted, you'd have pulled the goalkeeper out of position.' </p> <p>This time, in the Azteca Stadium, Maradona does exactly that. By the time Butcher lumbers up to clog him, he has already scored. Later, in the changing room, he tells Valdano that he had been watching him all along. </p> <p>'You scored this goal and you were watching me?' asks Valdano. 'You offend me, you humiliate me, it's not possible.' And Hector 'El Negro' Enrique calls from the shower: 'A lot of praise for him, but what about the guy who gave him the pass?' As Maradona comments in the book: 'Son of a bitch, Negro. In our own penalty area he gave me that pass!' </p> <p>However, Maradona confesses that at times he prefers the first goal, the one he scored with his hand. 'It was like stealing the wallet of the English.' </p> <p>No hard feelings, though. His visit to the Oxford Union in 1995 was 'one of the greatest joys of my life'. The crowd gives him an ovation and chants 'Diegouuu, Diegouuu!' in an English accent. </p> <p>He also offers praise to several British players. Michael Owen is 'for me, the only player who stood out at the World Cup in France. Speed, wickedness, balls. I hope that injuries don't ruin him.' George Best was 'a great player, but even crazier than me'. (For Maradona, 'crazy' is generally a term of approbation.) Kevin Keegan 'was my idol for a long time'. </p> <p>Only Shilton is castigated for his rage over the handled goal. 'And the other one, Shilton, didn't you see that? He didn't invite me to his farewell match. How many people can go to the farewell of a goalkeeper? A goalkeeper!' David Beckham, finally, is 'too beautiful to go on to the field'. But Maradona loves his passing. </p> <p>His favourite player, however, seems to be his fellow left-footer Rivelinho. Maradona tells a lovely anecdote about the Brazilian sitting around with Gerson and Tostao at the World Cup of 1970. 'They were doing nothing, because those guys didn't have to do anything to play. Then Pel\u00e9 turns up. And they think, \"This shit black man, what can we say to him? The son of a bitch does everything well!\" But Rivelinho always said the right thing. So he looked straight at Pel\u00e9, and said: \"Tell me the truth. You would have liked to have been a left-footer, wouldn't you?\" </p> <p>Soon Maradona may die. Argentine heroes tend to die young: Carlos Gardel, Eva Peron, Che Guevara, and this year, in a car accident at the age of 27, the singer Rodrigo. Maradona's addiction to cocaine is regarded in Britain as further proof that he is 'mad' (the habitual British tag for wayward foreign footballers) but Argentinians see it differently. They point out that Maradona has been under unusual pressure since his late teens. Rodrigo explains: </p> <p><em>He carries a cross on his shoulder</em> <br> <em>To be the best</em></p> <p>Significantly, it was when he moved abroad and joined Barcelona, the biggest club in the world, that he began taking drugs. Or in Rodrigo's words: </p> <p><em>Fame presented him with a</em> <br> <em>white woman </em><br> <em>Of mysterious taste and forbidden </em><br> <em>pleasure </em></p> <p>If Maradona ruined his body with cocaine, and took the banned substance ephedrine to lose weight for the 1994 World Cup, he did it to serve his country. He gave of his flesh. And Argentina, in endless decline since before he was born, demanded it of him. Yes, other great players bore their greatness better than he did, but Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer and Bobby Charlton were from rich countries where football didn't have to compensate for everything else, while Pel\u00e9 had the support of a generation so gifted that they won the 1962 World Cup without him. Maradona, however, carried Argentina on his shoulders. </p> <p>Now he has had enough. In Cuba, he has retreated from the world. The island may not excel at drugs rehabilitation, but it is a small place with few journalists where the national sport is baseball and the political leader a Communist who makes reassuring noises about the poor instead of going on about inflation and the peso-dollar link. Maradona prefers this to a rehab clinic in Canada besieged by journalists with none of his friends around. His unfulfilled dream, he writes, is 'to return to my country and be left in peace'. This will never happen. In Argentina he will only become more legendary until he dies and is given a funeral to dwarf Evita's. </p> <p>In England, he deserves better than to remain a victim of the fantasy that but for bad luck and cheating foreigners, this country would win more World Cups. Maradona might be a paranoid drug addict (he explains that governments want people to be drug addicts) but most of the time he seems to be a nice man. Sitting next to him at dinner in Oxford in 1995, I was astonished by his kindness. A few years later, I asked his old team-mate Valdano if he liked Maradona. </p> <p>Valdano replied: 'I love Maradona.' </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "'It was as if we had beaten a country, more than just a football team,' writes Diego Maradona in his new autobiography. 'Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas war, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was a revenge.' Like so much else in Yo soy el Diego (I am Diego), the account of Argentina's victory over England at the 1986 World Cup is fresh. 'Sometimes I think that everything in my life has been filmed,' writes Maradona, 'that all my life is in the magazines. And yet it isn't so.' Indeed not. This book reveals a different Maradona to the footballing Saddam Hussein of British perception. On Friday Maradona turns 40. He is expected to die soon. In Cuba he has ample free time. Perhaps for these reasons, he has told two Argentinian journalists the story of his life. The autobiography, which has an initial print run in Argentina of 150,000, is due to appear in 80 countries. Last month Maradona flew to Buenos Aires to promote it. Looking thinner than usual, he inveighed against hunger and poverty in Argentina, and after a few days received a phone call from Fidel Castro, who said, simply: 'Come back.' Maradona went. But in Argentina he is still everywhere. 'Marad\u00f3n!' the crowd began chanting at the end of the depressing international against Uruguay a fortnight ago. His face appears a dozen times on every newspaper kiosk, and the radios that play non-stop in Argentine houses assault you several times hourly with the singer Rodrigo's ode, La mano de Dios (Hand of God): In a shanty town he was born, It was God's will The shanty town of Villa Fiorito, well-documented as it is, was never so clear as in this account. The eight Maradona siblings growing up in one room; when it rained, more water inside the house than outside; the turquoise corduroys that were his only pair of trousers; his father working from four in the morning until three in the afternoon. 'It wasn't easy, eh? Nothing was easy,' says Maradona. It helps you understand why Maradona was perennially transporting an army of friends, relatives, and casual bystanders around the world. Snooty Catalonia was appalled when they all turned up in Barcelona in 1982, but Maradona delights in giving things to people. In the book he recounts the first time he took his family to the beach, the day he asked his father to stop working, and the Maradona family's first visit to Disneyworld (or Disneyland; he isn't quite sure). Yet it was tough. He made his professional debut at 15, his international debut at 16, and by 19 had scored 100 league goals. 'I knew the jealousy of the others... I locked myself in my room and cried. I wanted to buy everything. Nobody can imagine what was happening to me then... Like everything in my life, things were going too fast.' Very early in his career he began dreaming of playing only with boys, against boys, in a stadium where all the fans, the stewards and policemen were boys. His first World Cup, in 1982, is a deception. Maradona is mediocre, is kicked to pieces, and is sent off against Brazil for kicking the bearded Batista in the balls. As the book reveals, he got the wrong man. 'What few people know is that that kick was meant for Falcao.' All of Argentina is upset, but Maradona says: 'In our country there are many more important things than Maradona.' The military regime, for instance, which in 1982 still runs the country. Even today it repels him. But as he reminds us, when the moment came he shook the hand of General Videla, the dictator. He also cheerfully reveals himself as the Iago of international football. His spur, he tells us frequently, is revenge. At 17, omitted from Argentina's squad for the World Cup of 1978, he swears revenge; when an opposing goalkeeper calls him chunky and overrated, he puts four goals past him; after the World Cup of 1982, he swears revenge for the next World Cup; and there, confronting England, he avenges the Malvinas. He recounts that dribble through the England defence second by second. As he advances down the right of the field, beating Beardsley, Reid and Butcher, he can see his team-mate Jorge Valdano in space to his left. Then, however, Terry Fenwick arrives. 'He wouldn't leave me!' Maradona recalls. 'If Fenwick had left me, I could have given it to Valdano, who would have been alone in front of Shilton. But Fenwick didn't leave me! He kept me a terrible guard, Fenwick!' Finally Maradona shakes him off by feinting inside and going outside. Appearing in front of Shilton, he experiences a flashback.

We can take great confidence from the way we played against one of the biggest clubs in Europe.' </p> <p>They don't like to talk up their chances at Highbury but there is a growing feeling that Arsenal have a sporting chance in the competition.

A regular position for Hernan Crespo and Claudio Lopez, the world's most expensive strike force, must surely come soon. </p> <p>As Dixon points out, 'We have enough experience in the team to know that individuals don't win games. It's how you perform as a team and I thought we performed better than them. That's the key, especially in the Champions League. </p> <p>'It's a big, big effort to go through. You're playing top-class opposition and everybody has to be on their game or you just get pushed aside. That's what we've learned. It's more of a team game than in the Premiership, where sometimes you can play not so well and win with a touch of brilliance.' </p> <p>Theses were pertinent thoughts a day later as Milan's flabbergasted San Siro was in thrall. In 22 extraordinary minutes Rivaldo and Demetrio Albertini engaged in a personal duel of free kicks. While they were the cherries the cake was pretty tasty anywhere, as AC Milan and Barcelona indulged in a 3-3 free-for-all of wonderfully open, attacking, committed, breathless football. </p> <p>' Mamma Mia! ' wrote the journalist next to me who, trying to capture the spectacle, managed to get the Queen of England and James Bond into his eulogy. The expressions on the players' faces - a dramatic intensity sprung from total effort at terrifying speed - were amazing. This was a contest from a different realm to Lazio-Arsenal. </p> <p>You get the feeling there is so much more to come from these glamorous European campaigners. Thrilling to watch, no question, but neither team possessed the discipline and balance to play ruthless, winning football (though Barcelona were closest and should have won). 'I had the feeling we were a little bit stronger than them but 3-3 is not a bad result,' reflected Frank De Boer. </p> <p>With the super-powers building up a head of steam Leeds had better beware when Barcelona arrive at Elland Road on Tuesday with victory in mind. De Boer explains, 'We have the confidence to win in Leeds because every game we are improving. We have had bad results and been unlucky, playing well but conceding goals. Our luck has changed. The pressure is on Leeds.' </p> <p>In fact the greater pressure is on Barca, who dare not fail. David O'Leary's maturing side are sitting pretty, together with Arsenal and Manchester United at the top of their groups. The national team might be ailing but England's clubs are healthy enough. At least one United, perhaps even two, can expect to join the Londoners in the hat for the second phase. </p> <p>Arsenal are certain to face sterner examinations ahead but their authoritative form so far has at least made Europe's big clubs sit up and take notice. When Sven Goran Eriksson said Arsenal were capable of winning the competition after Lazio lost at Highbury last month it seemed he was trying to steer away from his own team's deficiencies. But the thoughtful Swede might not have been a million miles away. They are so much wiser now. </p> <p>Tactically, Arsene Wenger is growing in stature by the game. Fielding three forwards - Dennis Bergkamp alongside Thierry Henry and Kanu - to face Lazio at Highbury was brave. In Rome he reverted to a more secure formation but still had the nerve to bring on the wit of Pires and willingness of Sylvain Wiltord, a move which brought rich rewards. </p> <p>Arsenal's attacking possibilities have more variety and vigour than in previous campaigns. In 1998-99 Nicolas Anelka was still a baby with the modest Christopher Wreh in reserve. The following year Henry was feeling his way into a new role and Davor Suker never worked out. Now, Henry, Kanu and Wiltord have the experience, with Freddie Ljungberg and Pires providing genuine thrust from midfield. </p> <p>And what an acquisition Silvinho has been. The bright Brazilian full back is influential in both penalty areas. Credit is also due to Oleg Luzhny, who stepped in for Tony Adams with aplomb. The new faces in the famous old defence are clicking and so the rearguard steadily becomes more of a unit. Handy too that they have stopped conceding last-minute goals - one was disallowed in Rome. You need a lucky break or two in the Champions League. </p> <p>It has been a source of frustration for Arsenal that they feel a close match for Manchester United domestically, yet well in their shadows on the Continent. </p> <p>'It's about time we qualified,' grinned Dixon. 'We've shown this year that we have learnt something, to be a bit more positive. And we've learned we like playing at Highbury. The two seasons just gone we didn't win our home games even though we did well away from home, like getting a point in Barcelona. But the two results which set us up this season were beating Lazio at home and coming back from 2-0 to beat Shakhtar. </p> <p>'A lot was made about the Wembley factor and we didn't want to harp on, but I sincerely believe we would have qualified in the last couple of years had we been at Highbury. It makes a great difference to the players.' </p> <p>Although they lost Petit and Marc Overmars last summer, Arsenal appear to be reinforced. Their collective spirit is back on track, that is why Gilles Grimandi stuck up for Patrick Vieira in the face of racist taunts, why Martin Keown charged around protecting Lukic as if his life depended on it. </p> <p>'We make no secret of the fact we are quite close as a team,' said Dixon. 'Although we have a few different nationalities, we all get on. It's great at Highbury when we are playing well and everybody's getting a touch. It's when you come to places like Lazio, when your back is against the wall, that's when you see the character of the team. We showed here we never give up.' </p> <p>Exhausted but exhilarated, he added: 'Now, we've got to do it all again.'</p>",

Arsenal's attacking possibilities have more variety and vigour than in previous campaigns. In 1998-99 Nicolas Anelka was still a baby with the modest Christopher Wreh in reserve. The following year Henry was feeling his way into a new role and Davor Suker never worked out. Now, Henry, Kanu and Wiltord have the experience, with Freddie Ljungberg and Pires providing genuine thrust from midfield. And what an acquisition Silvinho has been. The bright Brazilian full back is influential in both penalty areas. Credit is also due to Oleg Luzhny, who stepped in for Tony Adams with aplomb. The new faces in the famous old defence are clicking and so the rearguard steadily becomes more of a unit. Handy too that they have stopped conceding last-minute goals - one was disallowed in Rome. You need a lucky break or two in the Champions League. It has been a source of frustration for Arsenal that they feel a close match for Manchester United domestically, yet well in their shadows on the Continent. 'It's about time we qualified,' grinned Dixon. 'We've shown this year that we have learnt something, to be a bit more positive. And we've learned we like playing at Highbury. The two seasons just gone we didn't win our home games even though we did well away from home, like getting a point in Barcelona. But the two results which set us up this season were beating Lazio at home and coming back from 2-0 to beat Shakhtar. 'A lot was made about the Wembley factor and we didn't want to harp on, but I sincerely believe we would have qualified in the last couple of years had we been at Highbury. It makes a great difference to the players.' Although they lost Petit and Marc Overmars last summer, Arsenal appear to be reinforced. Their collective spirit is back on track, that is why Gilles Grimandi stuck up for Patrick Vieira in the face of racist taunts, why Martin Keown charged around protecting Lukic as if his life depended on it. 'We make no secret of the fact we are quite close as a team,' said Dixon. 'Although we have a few different nationalities, we all get on. It's great at Highbury when we are playing well and everybody's getting a touch. It's when you come to places like Lazio, when your back is against the wall, that's when you see the character of the team. We showed here we never give up.' Exhausted but exhilarated, he added: 'Now, we've got to do it all again.'",

Thompson's supplementary effort in the second half dispelled the fretfulness. </p> <p>They could hardly be criticised for their lengthy, watchful silences, the league leaders having induced in them an apprehension which could be relieved only by a tangible sign of superiority. Territorial advantage really had to be accompanied by at least one goal. </p> <p>Larsson, despite looking relatively pedestrian - at times even uncharacteristically disoriented - could have scored five minutes before he gave the home side the lead, but sent his header against Alan Combe's right post after stooping to meet Thompson's corner. </p> <p>Larsson's goal also came from a set piece, this time a corner on the left, which Petrov played short to Thompson, who teed it up for the Bulgarian. His centre found Larsson diving into space to bullet the header past Combe from six yards. </p> <p>With their defence policy violated, United resorted to the contingency plan, clearly based on making quick headway towards Gould whenever a break in the pressure occurred. Predictably, they managed to create some alarm in the Celtic defence, which, with only Tom Boyd, Johan Mjallby and Joos Valgaeren patrolling the area, tended to be strung out by the Parkhead side's own emphasis on attack. </p> <p>On one sortie, Jonathan Gould was required to make a very handy save from Craig Easton, diving right at full stretch to push away a powerful low drive from the Scotland under-21 midfielder which would have brought the equaliser but for the goalkeeper's intervention. </p> <p>But John Licina clearly believed he had provided the goal with the last action of the first half, meeting a corner kick from the right and directing an intelligent header past Gould. It was stopped by Bobby Petta and, ultimately, gathered into the arms of Gould, but Licina made the kind of prolonged appeal to the referee which suggested he believed the ball had crossed the line. </p> <p>Thompson's goal would be met with raucous acclaim not only for its meaningfulness, but because it was so attractively constructed and sweetly executed during a match that had become rather bland. Lambert began the mischief by sliding the ball short to Mjallby and the big defender's cross from the right was high and looping. Chris Sutton, almost invariably the master in these situations, won the aerial joust with Jason de Vos and nodded the ball into the path of Thompson, whose beautifully-controlled, low, right-foot drive skidded at pace to the left of Combe and into the corner of the net. </p> <p>The goal which brought United previously unsuspected encouragement could hardly have been more different. A seemingly harmless cross from the left fell to John McQuillan, but he was easily dispossessed as he tried to control the ball and take aim at Gould's net. Lambert, coming across to complete the clearance, simply lashed the ball into his own net from six yards. </p> <p>If the scoreline looked distorted, it should still serve to encourage a United side still seeking their first league victory of a tortured season. There was evidence enough through the 90 minutes of their desire and resilience. A sprinkling of good fortune seems overdue. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Predictably, they managed to create some alarm in the Celtic defence, which, with only Tom Boyd, Johan Mjallby and Joos Valgaeren patrolling the area, tended to be strung out by the Parkhead side's own emphasis on attack. On one sortie, Jonathan Gould was required to make a very handy save from Craig Easton, diving right at full stretch to push away a powerful low drive from the Scotland under-21 midfielder which would have brought the equaliser but for the goalkeeper's intervention. But John Licina clearly believed he had provided the goal with the last action of the first half, meeting a corner kick from the right and directing an intelligent header past Gould. It was stopped by Bobby Petta and, ultimately, gathered into the arms of Gould, but Licina made the kind of prolonged appeal to the referee which suggested he believed the ball had crossed the line. Thompson's goal would be met with raucous acclaim not only for its meaningfulness, but because it was so attractively constructed and sweetly executed during a match that had become rather bland. Lambert began the mischief by sliding the ball short to Mjallby and the big defender's cross from the right was high and looping. Chris Sutton, almost invariably the master in these situations, won the aerial joust with Jason de Vos and nodded the ball into the path of Thompson, whose beautifully-controlled, low, right-foot drive skidded at pace to the left of Combe and into the corner of the net. The goal which brought United previously unsuspected encouragement could hardly have been more different. A seemingly harmless cross from the left fell to John McQuillan, but he was easily dispossessed as he tried to control the ball and take aim at Gould's net. Lambert, coming across to complete the clearance, simply lashed the ball into his own net from six yards. If the scoreline looked distorted, it should still serve to encourage a United side still seeking their first league victory of a tortured season. There was evidence enough through the 90 minutes of their desire and resilience. A sprinkling of good fortune seems overdue. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

But then Ryan Williams, Chesterfield's chief creator, dribbled his way to the byline and crossed to the far post where substitute Jamie Ingledow, only on for the final nine minutes, crashed in the winning header. </p> <p>Chesterfield have plans to move to the greyhound stadium while Brighton are already playing at their local athletics venue. But neither is going to the dogs; both certainly appear right on track. </p> <p>The first half was a tightly-contested affair, epitomised by a challenge eight minutes before the break when the ball was fortunate to come out left with any air in it. Ryan Williams, Chesterfield's busy winger, and Oatway, one of Brighton's skin-headed hard men, went in completely fairly on that occasion. But when they rumbled in stoppage time, the tension spilled over. All but three player rushed in to give their version of events which ended with Oatway being booked. But it was Brighton who edged the first period, eight-goal Bobby Zamora swivelling on to a loose ball after eight minutes to shoot wide. </p> <p>Unfortunately Oatway could not dim his combative-ness and six minutes after the break, as Sean Parrish broke clear of him in the centre circle, the Brighton midfielder clipped his opponent's heels. </p> <p>Both clubs have known how it feels to prop up a division, Chesterfield having finished bottom of the Second Division last May while Brighton, three times in five seasons, finished in penultimate spot. This year however, things have been looking up. </p> <p>Ambition has been reflected in investment. No club in the basement division has outlaid more than the \u00a3150,000 Chesterfield spent on Luke Beckett, missing with a thigh injury yesterday, who scored 19 goals for doomed Chester City. </p> <p>But expectation was also high for Mickey Adams' team this season, after they finished last term unbeaten in 14 games, though this season started off at a trundle before this long unbeaten run. The first goal they had conceded in ten hours was even credited to their own goalkeeper, on Wednesday, when Michel Kuipers fumbled a Hartlepool cross over his own line. </p> <p>Chesterfield meanwhile, under the guidance of former captain Nicky Law, immortalised at Saltergate for leading the team to Wembley triumph five years ago in the Third Division play-off final against Bury, have exceeded hopes. They had won six games on the bounce before two draws culminated in a 2-2 share at Rochdale on Tuesday. </p> <p>But Chesterfield, despite being pinned back in their own half for much of the early action yesterday, at least held their own in the first period. They tore into Brighton and were unfortunate when Marcus Ebdon, with 20 minutes remaining, collected the ball off David Reeves, composed himself and curled a shot towards the top corner only for Kuipers to save in spectacular fashion. Brighton defended with resolve but after 84 minutes were again grateful for their reserve goalkeeper when Kuipers tipped Ebdon's 25-yard volley aside.</p>",

Ryan Williams, Chesterfield's busy winger, and Oatway, one of Brighton's skin-headed hard men, went in completely fairly on that occasion. But when they rumbled in stoppage time, the tension spilled over. All but three player rushed in to give their version of events which ended with Oatway being booked. But it was Brighton who edged the first period, eight-goal Bobby Zamora swivelling on to a loose ball after eight minutes to shoot wide. Unfortunately Oatway could not dim his combative-ness and six minutes after the break, as Sean Parrish broke clear of him in the centre circle, the Brighton midfielder clipped his opponent's heels. Both clubs have known how it feels to prop up a division, Chesterfield having finished bottom of the Second Division last May while Brighton, three times in five seasons, finished in penultimate spot. This year however, things have been looking up. Ambition has been reflected in investment. No club in the basement division has outlaid more than the \u00a3150,000 Chesterfield spent on Luke Beckett, missing with a thigh injury yesterday, who scored 19 goals for doomed Chester City. But expectation was also high for Mickey Adams' team this season, after they finished last term unbeaten in 14 games, though this season started off at a trundle before this long unbeaten run. The first goal they had conceded in ten hours was even credited to their own goalkeeper, on Wednesday, when Michel Kuipers fumbled a Hartlepool cross over his own line. Chesterfield meanwhile, under the guidance of former captain Nicky Law, immortalised at Saltergate for leading the team to Wembley triumph five years ago in the Third Division play-off final against Bury, have exceeded hopes. They had won six games on the bounce before two draws culminated in a 2-2 share at Rochdale on Tuesday. But Chesterfield, despite being pinned back in their own half for much of the early action yesterday, at least held their own in the first period. They tore into Brighton and were unfortunate when Marcus Ebdon, with 20 minutes remaining, collected the ball off David Reeves, composed himself and curled a shot towards the top corner only for Kuipers to save in spectacular fashion. Brighton defended with resolve but after 84 minutes were again grateful for their reserve goalkeeper when Kuipers tipped Ebdon's 25-yard volley aside.",

He revealed the extent of physical and mental abuse he suffered during 60 weeks of solitary confinement. In an exclusive interview with The Observer , the 27-year-old Briton told for the first time how he was deprived of human rights. Mawdsley, a physics student who dropped out of Bristol University after one year despite being tipped for a double first, described how he was kept under 24-hour observation in a cell flooded with light and beaten by guards with truncheons and gravel-filled stockings. He told how, on one occasion, 15 guards burst into his room after he had written the Burmese word for 'peace' on his cell door in water and illustrated it with the symbol of a cross. They left him semi-conscious in a pool of blood. But he said that every privation was worth the pain if it helped the country escape the military dictatorship that has ruled since Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the opposition National League for Democracy, was prevented from taking office after winning a 1990 election. Emotional and weary after his 36-hour journey from the remote Keng Tung prison, Mawdsley arrived back home in Britain in the early hours of yesterday morning to adulation and applause. He said that he had been 'absolutely delighted' when the Burmese court had condemned him to 17 years in jail in August 1999. It was the third time in two years that the human rights activist had been arrested in Burma for trying to highlight the genocide of 30,000 members of the Karenni tribe and displacement of 600,000 more. He had been 'frustrated', he said, when deported in 1998, but felt that he was 'finally getting somewhere' when he was imprisoned after returning a few months later without a passport.

I could hear logs being chopped, children playing, pigs squealing, cockerels squawking, and could smell the woodsmoke and the wet jungle. Memories came flooding back and I found myself terribly anxious.</p> <p>Would people remember me? Would they be happy to see me? But my welcome at the camp in Thailand, near the Burmese border, could not have been warmer. Many of the students I had taught English now had children. One was named after me, born while I was in jail. 'Gold Rachel' was delightful and, unlike most Karenni babies, didn't scream at the sight of a white face.</p> <p>And then there were the new arrivals, with terrible tales of persecution and suffering. They had been living in the jungle for several years, having fled the relocation decreed in the Nineties by Burma's military dictatorship, one called 'Slorc' and now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).</p> <p>Their individual stories formed a picture of genocide. In the jungle they had to move five or six times a year, and slept without a roof over them. Their hiding place was discovered when their fifth child had just been born. Samuel is a skinny, unusually tall Karenni. 'The placenta hadn't even come out yet. I was terribly worried about my wife, I carried her through the streams as I was afraid about her walking through the cold water. But when we got to the border I couldn't carry her as we had to walk in the stream a long way. Now she gets migraines all the time.' The family walked for three weeks. They had to evade not just troops but mines and had to rely for guidance either on hired guides or resistance army soldiers.</p> <p>The Karenni are among the many persecuted ethnic minorities in Burma. Those that have no ceasefire agreement with the dictatorship have had their areas declared free-fire zones.

The so-called 'Four Cuts' campaign tries to stop food, recruits, information and money reaching the resistance armies.</p> <p>Forced relocation began in 1974 in Karen and Chin State. In 1996 the scale of relocations increased dramatically, with 25,000 people forced into 'relocation centres' within Karenni State: roughly one eighth of the Karenni people torn from their ancestral lands in 12 months.</p> <p>Many areas of Karenni State, as well as other parts of Burma, have been cleared: 30,000 people used to live in an area approximately 100 miles by 30 miles in eastern Karenni, now it is completely depopulated.

They took some as forced porters and others to Loikaw - the capital of Karenni State. Some managed to escape, others were put in jail, about 20 men disappeared. My husband hid in the jungle, many men did. After they arrested the men, they called the women together and said \"if we hear gun shots or that rebel groups are in the area, then we will kill you\".'

She describes the story of her cousin's family, also in hiding, camped on the riverbank. They were hit by a flash flood.</p> <p>'All the children and Htoo La Paw were washed away, but two children were thrown to safety on the land. Htoo La Paw was badly injured. Later they found the elder girl under a log, her feet were sticking out from the freshly deposited sand and mud. They dug out her body, her head was crushed. The youngest daughter they found hanging in the bushes, dead, after the flood receded. They have been internally displaced people for five years, and want to come here. Everything they had was washed away, so they have no money to pay for a guide, or to be able to buy food on the way.'</p> <p>Mee Reh's wife reflects on how lucky they are that her eldest child is attending school.

I could hear logs being chopped, children playing, pigs squealing, cockerels squawking, and could smell the woodsmoke and the wet jungle. Memories came flooding back and I found myself terribly anxious. Would people remember me? Would they be happy to see me? But my welcome at the camp in Thailand, near the Burmese border, could not have been warmer. Many of the students I had taught English now had children. One was named after me, born while I was in jail. 'Gold Rachel' was delightful and, unlike most Karenni babies, didn't scream at the sight of a white face. And then there were the new arrivals, with terrible tales of persecution and suffering. They had been living in the jungle for several years, having fled the relocation decreed in the Nineties by Burma's military dictatorship, one called 'Slorc' and now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Their individual stories formed a picture of genocide. In the jungle they had to move five or six times a year, and slept without a roof over them. Their hiding place was discovered when their fifth child had just been born. Samuel is a skinny, unusually tall Karenni. 'The placenta hadn't even come out yet. I was terribly worried about my wife, I carried her through the streams as I was afraid about her walking through the cold water. But when we got to the border I couldn't carry her as we had to walk in the stream a long way. Now she gets migraines all the time.' The family walked for three weeks. They had to evade not just troops but mines and had to rely for guidance either on hired guides or resistance army soldiers. The Karenni are among the many persecuted ethnic minorities in Burma.

      "body": "<p>Thirty-three years ago, after making his cinematic debut with a small-scale black-and-white movie in Britain, John Boorman went to the States and became a world figure overnight directing Lee Marvin in Point Blank, a very European treatment of an archetypal American subject.</p> <p>The 29-year-old Christopher Nolan has done something similar. Last year he made an auspicious debut with the zero-budget Following, shot in black-and-white on London streets. He has now written and directed one of the year's most exciting pictures, Memento, which is, like Point Blank, a revenge thriller set in southern California that repays with interest its debts to Alain Resnais. Also like Point Blank, its progress is circular, ending where it begins. </p> <p>The movie (based on a story by the director's brother, Jonathan Nolan), uses a favourite plot device of postwar Freudian film noir, the hero suffering from amnesia. Hitchcock's Spellbound is perhaps the most celebrated example. But Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), the protagonist of Memento, suffers from a special form of amnesia. Due to a blow received from the man who raped and murdered his wife, Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss. He can recall his life up to the murder, but thereafter he can't remember anything for more than a few minutes at best, though he's painfully aware of his condition.</p> <p>As he pursues the killer he's reduced to making notes, annotating Polaroid pictures, having essential information tattooed on his body either by a professional in a tattoo parlour or with his own needle. He also has to depend on others, all unreliable - the devious desk clerk at a seedy motel, attractive barmaid Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who may be using him for her own ends, the slimy, ubiquitous Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be a solicitous cop but might well be a crook. </p> <p>Like Following, the story is told out of sequence, with some scenes in monochrome, and at a hectic rate. This gets us involved by forcing us to exercise our own memories in reconstructing a chronological narrative. The scratches on Shelby's cheek - where did they come from? The bruises on Natalie's face - who gave them to her and when? As Leonard goes about his desperate quest around Los Angeles, we question our own perception of the world. </p> <p>There is another layer to the story that relates to Leonard's earlier life as an ace insurance investigator in San Francisco, the same profession Edward G. Robinson followed in Double Indemnity. The job requires a combination of intuition and ratiocination, both underpinned by the necessity to be eternally mistrustful.</p> <p>On Leonard's left hand is tattooed the admonition 'Remember Sammy Jankis'. Sammy, a certified public accountant (movingly played by Stephen Tobolowsky), was incapacitated by short-term memory loss after an accident. In order to frustrate his insurance claim, Leonard had to prove either that Sammy was bluffing or that his condition was psychological, not physical. The tragic destruction of Sammy and his wife, as narrated by Leonard, is a parallel story in a different register, which unfolds in sequence and makes Leonard believe that he's the victim of poetic justice. </p> <p>The photography, editing and production design are of the first rank, belying the film's modest budget, and the performances have a strange intensity. Guy Pearce brings total conviction to Leonard, making an everyman of this bewildered questor. 'If you get your revenge, you're not going to be able to remember it,' Natalie tells him.</p>",

The movie (based on a story by the director's brother, Jonathan Nolan), uses a favourite plot device of postwar Freudian film noir, the hero suffering from amnesia. Hitchcock's Spellbound is perhaps the most celebrated example. But Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), the protagonist of Memento, suffers from a special form of amnesia. Due to a blow received from the man who raped and murdered his wife, Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss. He can recall his life up to the murder, but thereafter he can't remember anything for more than a few minutes at best, though he's painfully aware of his condition. As he pursues the killer he's reduced to making notes, annotating Polaroid pictures, having essential information tattooed on his body either by a professional in a tattoo parlour or with his own needle. He also has to depend on others, all unreliable - the devious desk clerk at a seedy motel, attractive barmaid Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who may be using him for her own ends, the slimy, ubiquitous Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be a solicitous cop but might well be a crook. Like Following, the story is told out of sequence, with some scenes in monochrome, and at a hectic rate. This gets us involved by forcing us to exercise our own memories in reconstructing a chronological narrative. The scratches on Shelby's cheek - where did they come from? The bruises on Natalie's face - who gave them to her and when? As Leonard goes about his desperate quest around Los Angeles, we question our own perception of the world. There is another layer to the story that relates to Leonard's earlier life as an ace insurance investigator in San Francisco, the same profession Edward G. Robinson followed in Double Indemnity. The job requires a combination of intuition and ratiocination, both underpinned by the necessity to be eternally mistrustful. On Leonard's left hand is tattooed the admonition 'Remember Sammy Jankis'. Sammy, a certified public accountant (movingly played by Stephen Tobolowsky), was incapacitated by short-term memory loss after an accident. In order to frustrate his insurance claim, Leonard had to prove either that Sammy was bluffing or that his condition was psychological, not physical. The tragic destruction of Sammy and his wife, as narrated by Leonard, is a parallel story in a different register, which unfolds in sequence and makes Leonard believe that he's the victim of poetic justice. The photography, editing and production design are of the first rank, belying the film's modest budget, and the performances have a strange intensity. Guy Pearce brings total conviction to Leonard, making an everyman of this bewildered questor. 'If you get your revenge, you're not going to be able to remember it,' Natalie tells him.",

There was that comic cut on the Charleroi touchline, when Kevin Keegan tried to explain to Southgate that he wanted him to sit in front of the defence as a holding midfield player to stem the Romanian tide, a position he was also fatefully asked to fulfil against Germany a fortnight ago amid mumblings of discontent within the England squad.

But I've played around 12 games now and I think I've proved myself. </p> <p>'All along my aim has been to help Villa breach the gap and get in the top two or three. I would love nothing better than for that to happen because of the hard work I have put in here but at the moment we are still a fair way short. I wanted to be involved with England as well so I had to maintain my form for that but I also didn't want people to say I was not giving my all. I am a stronger person than that.' </p> <p>Frustrated by Villa's inability to sign top players and join the elite of the Premiership, Southgate requested a transfer in May. Chelsea and Deportivo La Coruna showed interest but the \u00a310 million price tag and the current transfer market uncertainty has cooled interest. Despite that, he remains outspoken about Villa's limitations. </p> <p>'If you are detached from Villa, and it's probably the same for five or six clubs, you would say \"yes, they are a top six side but nothing more is expected of them.\" When you are involved in it, you try to be as positive as possible and wave the flag but aiming for the title - which is what you have to do, because simply trying to get a Champions League place is a bit of a get-out now - is quite a way from our grasp. </p> <p>'Signing a top-quality striker would go some way to achieving the goals we are capable of but, again, you have five or six clubs who are probably two players short,.

But once we started playing, I was focused, as any athlete would be, and it's not caused me a problem. I realise players speaking out is frowned upon but I am not trying to undermine the club, just calling it as I see it. I would like to win some honours before I retire. </p> <p>'There's almost a 50-50 split with the fans. A lot of people agree with what I say but naturally hard-and-fast Villa fans don't agree. In the main though, they can see the way I have been playing, the effort I put in, and they can't criticise me on that front.' </p> <p>He also escaped criticism for England's defeat by Germany, that falling to Kevin Keegan for playing him out of position. 'Once he had named me there, a lot of people had written their post-mortems and I was expecting that myself. I knew it would be a surprise and people would wonder why Paul Ince or Dennis Wise weren't playing there. I desperately wanted it to work. Three years ago what was said on the Saturday morning would have been hard to take but I've been around long enough now.

      "body": "<p>In Wonder Boys, Grady Tripp, the middle-aged novelist played by Michael Douglas, has got a problem. The inkwell of inspiration has run dry. He hasn't published anything in seven years since his last book, an acclaimed bestseller. There is an all too obvious comparison to be made with Curtis Hanson, the middle-aged director of Wonder Boys: the curse of the onerous follow-up. </p> <p>Until the release of his last film Hanson was not a critics' darling, but a well-regarded journeyman, best known as the director-for-hire of hit thrillers, The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and The River Wild. Then in 1997, after 20 years of hurt and humbling experiences in Hollywood, he finally got to make the film he wanted. The result was L.A. Confidential, the glorious neo-noir thriller adapted from James Ellroy's labyrinthine novel. Conventional wisdom suggested it was too dense for the screen; not so, the tour-de-force was one of the shining films of the Nineties. Critics universally hailed it the best thriller since Chinatown, perhaps even better. Suddenly Hanson was on the A-list. </p> <p>So how do you follow that up? Obviously the weight of expectation has not unduly burdened the shoulders of this slim, 55-year-old dressed head to toe in black. 'I had been in this business trying so hard for so long, rather than paralysis me with fear it did the opposite,' he explains in measured tones. 'It actually liberated me. I used that success to make the kind of movie I had always wanted to do before.' </p> <p>His response, Wonder Boys, adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, is a work of obvious assurance. The pleasure is in the pacing and the details. It's an offbeat, languid and dark comedy set in a wintry Pittsburgh campus during a literary festival. Douglas is the slowly unravelling Tripp, an English professor and author of The Arsonist's Daughter, the literary sensation that sealed his reputation. </p> <p>The movie follows him over the course of what turns out to be a lost weekend, starting inauspiciously for him when his wife walks out. Douglas heads the cast although this is an ensemble piece with a fine cast. Robert Downey Jr is Tripp's desperate agent, Tobey Maguire, the freakish, introverted star pupil, Frances McDormand, his mistress and Katie Holmes, his seductive student lodger. </p> <p>The bizarre parade of events in Wonder Boys would make the plot read like a screwball comedy. Accidental shootings, illicit trysts and zany misunderstandings are de regueur. But it was the characters that attracted Hanson. 'Michael Chabon presents these characters to us in a completely non-judgemental way. I liked the fact that there was an absence of attitude from the storyteller's point of view.' Likewise with L.A. Confidential, which he does not consider to be a noir film, Hanson was really interested in the ambiguous cops. 'I wanted to tell the story of the case but what really interested me was the emotional life of the cops. I was intrigued by them the same way I was about Wonder Boys - the difference is here they made me laugh.' </p> <p> Hanson sees himself as an actors' director. Working with them is his favourite part of the process. He persuaded Meryl Streep to get buff and ride the rapids in The River Wild. He later coaxed an unanticipated Oscar-winning performance from Kim Banister in L.A. Confidential. Simultaneously he persuaded Warner Bros. to hire two relative unknown Australian actors, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe, for the leading roles. </p> <p>It's a measure of Hanson's post- L.A. Confidential status that while the convincing executives to back the unconventional project proved tricky, the cast happily signed on. 'Actors don't necessarily care, thank God, how well certain things do at the box office. But they care how the performances look and after L.A. Confidential actors started to want to work with me,' he says. Douglas took a hefty paycut to play the pot-smoking campus romantic who grows steadily more tousled with each passing frame. </p> <p>Seeing Michael Douglas flirt with Middle American mores is nothing new, but here he is stripped of his movie star sheen. But his apparent lack of vanity is appealing and why, one suspects, he leaped at the chance. </p> <p> Wonder Boys wasn't a success with American audiences when released earlier this year. Despite strong reviews, the movie failed to open at the box-office and in an unusual move was swiftly pulled from all cinemas. The studio hadn't lost faith; this was damage limitation. It will get a second chance in the States next month in competition with the award season's other contenders. </p> <p>The release and marketing cock-up clearly rankles. Hanson gives a detailed account of the dispute with the studio over selling Wonder Boys. It was, he concedes, a tough sell, but that's their job. The low point was the misleading poster; a profile shot of a smirking, self-satisfied Douglas that 'looked like he was trying to be Robin Williams'. He can't think of an adjective kind enough to describe the marketing campaign. </p> <p>In 1993 when The Hand That Rock The Cradle, a low-budget, two-dimensional suspense emerged as an unexpected blockbuster he was entrusted to make L.A. Confidential. A couple of years after his 50th birthday, Hanson's serious directing career began. So what took him so long? 'I've always been interested in going my own way. It may not have appeared that way but I've always been picky in what I've done. That's why I haven't done more movies,' he says. (He has directed only 10) 'I did those that appealed to me the most.' </p> <p>But surely there is a big difference between The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and L.A. Confidential? 'My last two films were labours of love in the sense that I had control from start to finish. There were still battles, but both times I won the important battles as opposed to losing them,' he says. </p> <p>The son of Los Angeles schoolmaster, Hanson passed on the chance to attend film school with the Scorseses, Lucases and Spielbergs. His cinema education came while editing the influential journal, Cinema. Using his day job as cover he would ring his idols and request interviews and set visits from the likes of John Ford, Vincente Minnelli and Samuel Fuller. </p> <p>Gradually he picked up screenwriting work. His first film, a superior B-movie called Sweet Kill, was made in 1972 but it was eight years before he completed his next feature. 'I know I took the long way round,' he laughs ruefully. 'But I kind of pursued two routes at the same time - writing and directing. It wasn't until The Bedroom Window in 1987 that I could persuade someone to let me do both together.' Along the way there were hiccups. Roman Polanski was set to film his script of White Dog hot off Chinatown. 'I thought 'fantastic' because I was a fan. Could it be this easy that I'm going to get to do this fantastic thing.' It wasn't. Charged with having sex with an underage girl, Polanski skipped bail and the country in 1978. Hanson eventually collaborated with his mentor, the irascible Fuller on the allegorical film in 1982. </p> <p>So Hanson strikes a dissonant note. At a time when many of his peers have made their best movies, Hanson is in his prime, fusing a winning mix of studio gloss and indie sensibilities. The actors and critics like him, audiences are apparently divided.How long will Hollywood support him? </p> <p>He is philosophical: 'I know the leverage I've got now is fleeting. You lose it as easily as you get it so I appreciate it. I look at it as 'okay, now I can do one more movie in the way that I want'. You know, I approach it all one at a time.' </p> <p><strong>Hanson's track record </strong></p> <p><strong>The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) </strong><br> A prosperous suburban family face the ultimate nightmare: a duplicitous nanny worms her way into their home and affections with evil intent.</p> <p><strong>The River Wild (1994) </strong><br> Meryl Streep turned action heroine in this tense drama about a family's rowing holiday ruined by the presence of a menacing stranger.

      "body": "<p>Pel\u00e9 blames Maradona for spreading worldwide rumours that the Brazilian had a homosexual affair with a coach - and claims the reason was jealousy. </p> <p>The spat between the world's two most famous footballers emerges in a new book to be published next week in Britain. </p> <p>Pel\u00e9 and Maradona both have autobiographies released this month. In Pel\u00e9: His Life and Times the great man dismisses the story that he had confessed to a gay affair with one of the coaches in charge of young players at his Brazilian club, Santos. Pel\u00e9 claims Maradona was jealous of his status - and that led to him starting the rumour last year. </p> <p>Pel\u00e9, who co-operated with English author Harry Harris, chose to leave the detailed explanation to his close friend Celso Grellet. But Grellet's version of events has been read and authorised by Pel\u00e9. </p> <p>Grellet insists Pel\u00e9 thought hard about a response at the time but did not want a direct confrontation with Maradona, who had serious drugs-related heart problems earlier this year. </p> <p>Grellet explained: 'One day I was very surprised to receive a number of calls from journalists for my com ment because Maradona had said that Pel\u00e9 had had a homosexual experience. It was never true but Pel\u00e9 is a big man and he decided that he would not respond and create a big battle between himself and Maradona. </p> <p>'Pel\u00e9 is heavily involved in the anti-drugs campaign, particularly the abuse of drugs in sport, and Maradona was clearly an ill man.

      "bodyText": "Pel\u00e9 blames Maradona for spreading worldwide rumours that the Brazilian had a homosexual affair with a coach - and claims the reason was jealousy. The spat between the world's two most famous footballers emerges in a new book to be published next week in Britain. Pel\u00e9 and Maradona both have autobiographies released this month. In Pel\u00e9: His Life and Times the great man dismisses the story that he had confessed to a gay affair with one of the coaches in charge of young players at his Brazilian club, Santos. Pel\u00e9 claims Maradona was jealous of his status - and that led to him starting the rumour last year. Pel\u00e9, who co-operated with English author Harry Harris, chose to leave the detailed explanation to his close friend Celso Grellet. But Grellet's version of events has been read and authorised by Pel\u00e9. Grellet insists Pel\u00e9 thought hard about a response at the time but did not want a direct confrontation with Maradona, who had serious drugs-related heart problems earlier this year. Grellet explained: 'One day I was very surprised to receive a number of calls from journalists for my com ment because Maradona had said that Pel\u00e9 had had a homosexual experience. It was never true but Pel\u00e9 is a big man and he decided that he would not respond and create a big battle between himself and Maradona. 'Pel\u00e9 is heavily involved in the anti-drugs campaign, particularly the abuse of drugs in sport, and Maradona was clearly an ill man. Pel\u00e9 felt it was best not to respond because no one could possibly take Maradona seriously. There is no doubt from my point of view that Maradona has made ludicrous accusations, the one about Pel\u00e9's sexuality being just one of many, as a result of pure envy. 'Maradona was very jealous of Pel\u00e9 and has been ever since Carlos Menem, the for mer Argentine president, invited Pel\u00e9 to the country as his special guest because Pel\u00e9 was his favourite player. It angered Maradona that the Argentine people might place Pel\u00e9 above him. 'Pel\u00e9 has a lot of respect for Maradona as a player but felt that he media should not give any credence to the comments of an ill man. It would have been too easy to have said bad things about Maradona in return, but Pel\u00e9 would not do it ... for me it was a very sad episode because I have always thought that Maradona was the best footballer in the world after Pel\u00e9.' The Pel\u00e9 biography, published by Robson Books, is available on the web through sportal.com, while the Maradona autobiography, I am Diego is serialised on umbro.com. In it, Maradona lists his 100 favourite players and accords Pel\u00e9 number one status - but his appreciation is spiked with criticism : 'As a player he had it all but didn't make the most of it to raise the status of football. I'd have liked to see him put himself forward as president of an association to defend players' rights - like I did. I'd like to have seen him look after Garrincha and not let him die in misery.

Five-star luxury in Madeira With temperatures in the high 60 Fs and a display of fairy lights that makes Regent Street look about as exciting as a 40-watt lightbulb, the Madeiran capital of Funchal has plenty to offer in December. Prestige Holidays (01425 480400) is promoting the five-star Cliff Bay Hotel, a 20-minute walk from the centre of town.

Disney magic in Paris Recommended for hardcore Santa devotees of all ages, Disneyland Paris really lights up at Christmas. The park is open until 8pm every evening, and if the Electrical Parade and tree lighting ceremony fail to get you in the festive mood then you're a lost cause. Cresta Holidays (0870 1610 910) is offering three nights at the Hotel Santa Fe for two adults and two children under 12 for \u00a3726. The price includes breakfast, entrance to the park for the duration of your stay and a Dover-Calais crossing with Sea France on Christmas Eve.

Cottage hideaway in Somerset By the time Christmas Day finally heaves into view most of us are ready to get away from it all. Helpful Holidays (01647 433593) has the ideal retreat: a remote gamekeeper's cottage in Somerset, hidden among pine trees, nearly a mile from the nearest village, yet an easy walk to the pub. The cottage sleeps seven in four bedrooms and costs \u00a3316 for the week beginning 22 December. The company has more than 450 holiday homes for hire in the West Country. 4. Indian winter If you'd rather be sitting under a palm tree than carrying home a fir tree then consider Goa. Located in the livelier north end of the resort, the Goan Heritage Hotel sits in gardens that lead down to the Calangute Beach. The property has a gym, beauty parlour, pool, restaurant and offers evening entertainment. Hayes and Jarvis (0870 89 89 890) has flights departing from Gatwick on 21 December. A seven-night break costs \u00a3689 including flights, transfers and bed and breakfast accommodation. 5. Meet Father Christmas in Lapland Eclipse Holidays (0870 5010 203) is offering short active breaks to Lapland.

York country house retreat Middlethorpe Hall (01904 641241), a country house hotel on the outskirts of York, is offering a traditional festive package. A three-night stay costs \u00a3595 per person, which includes a champagne and carols reception on Christmas Eve, early morning tea served with a present on Christmas Day, traditional lunch and a light tea. There's also the opportunity to attend the Christmas morning service in York Minster. Boxing Day dawns with a champagne brunch before a race day excursion to Wetherby. 7. Motoring in New Zealand Swap grey skies and teeming high streets for sunshine and open roads; New Zealand will be at the height of its summer over the Christmas period. Austravel (0117 933 0450) has a 12-day package for people wanting to explore the North Island by motorhome. Also included in the price of \u00a3940 are scheduled flights and three nights' accommodation in Auckland, giving you time to explore the City of Sails before setting off around the North Island. Departures are between 12 and 24 December. 8. Short breaks in Istanbul Legend has it that Father Christmas hailed from Turkey. He started life as a fourth-century bishop - later St Nicholas - who would give anonymous gifts to dowryless village girls. Sovereign Cities and Short Breaks (0870 576 8373) has availability on a range of short breaks to Istanbul. The four-star Hotel President, located in the rambling old town, costs from \u00a3419 per person from 15 December, based on bed and breakfast accommodation, flights from Heathrow and transfers. 9. Escape to Dubai If you want to escape from tinsel and twinkly lights this year, then try Dubai - the Muslim state does not officially celebrate Christmas. Crystal Cities (0870 888 0022) has availability at the four-star City Centre Hotel, which features a rooftop pool, squash and tennis courts and is adjacent to the shopping mall if you want to treat yourself to a few Christmas presents. Departing between 25 and 31 December, the price of \u00a3615 per person includes flights from Gatwick and three nights' bed and breakfast accommodation. 10.

The cottages sleep from two to five people and prices start at \u00a3180 for the week beginning 22 December. 11. Christmas in Las Vegas Known for its year-round glitziness, Las Vegas goes into overdrive at Christmas.

Prices start at \u00a3679 per person and include four-star accommodation and a car. 12. Skiing in France Get together a group of friends and head off for the slopes. The French resort of Serre Chevalier offers 250km of piste, with a good combination of blue and red runs that will keep most intermediate skiers happy. First Choice Ski (0870 754 3477) is promoting the four-star Chalet Asters, which sleeps up to 17 people and is located 400 metres from the ski lift. Seven nights cost \u00a3429 per person for half-board accommodation, based on two people sharing. If you can fill the chalet with friends you'll be rewarded with one free place. Flights depart Gatwick for Turin on 24 December and transfers are included. 13. Winter sun in Gambia If you are looking for guaranteed winter sunshine without guaranteed jetlag then Gambia may fit the bill. The flight is six hours but no time zone changes mean that you can make the most of the 80 F temperatures from the moment you arrive.

Start your holiday with two nights at the Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve, where Land Rover and walking safaris provide an excellent chance of encountering the 'big five'. Move on to the Irene Country Lodge for a night then board the historic Blue Train to journey overnight from Pretoria to Cape Town before rounding off the trip with three nights at the five-star Htel Le Vendme in Cape Town. Prices start at \u00a32,299 per person for departures on 22 December. 15.

      "body": "<p> It's four o'clock in Reykjavik's main shopping street, and the road is choked with a slow procession of cars, checking out the action on the crowded pavements. Iceland's young are out in force, parading up and down, colonising street corners in small groups, laughing, joking and admiring each others' new clothes. It's the same weekend scene you'll see on any main street in Europe's capital cities - except here, the shops have been closed for hours. It's four o'clock in the morning. And no one looks like they're ready to go home. </p> <p>At first glance, Iceland is an unlikely destination for ravers. A country with a population of only 280,000 and a language that has barely changed since the sagas were written down in the thirteenth century, until recently its main attraction for tourists was its awesome landscape. When I first visited in 1990, beer had been legal for less than a year, all-night clubs were unheard of, and our party of 40 or so regulars from a Soho club called The Brain, there to enjoy a weekend's dancing in Reykjavik's now-defunct Moon Club, were considered a great novelty. </p> <p>Those of us who'd come expecting an isolated, unsophisticated backwater were in for a surprise: the clubbers we met were mostly well-travelled, cool and cosmopolitan. But the real eye-opener was the crowd circulating in the streets outside on a Friday and Saturday night. A rowdy but good-looking mass drunkenly staggering round the city centre in search of fun, their energy, friendliness and lack of inhibition made for a memorable weekend. Except in the short summer months, Icelanders don't have a great deal of daylight, and so they make the most of every second of it. Their attitude to youth seems much the same: it doesn't last, so you should enjoy it to the full. </p> <p> It's little wonder that revellers from other parts of Europe came to join in. In fact, Iceland has a long history of partying hard. Reykjavik's oldest surviving building at 10 Aoalstraeti was once occupied by Bishop Geir V\u00eddal\u00edn (1761-1823), so famous for his hospitality that he once boasted: 'There are two places where the fires never die down - Hell and my house.' </p> <p>Sadly, the cleric's life had other parallels with modern Iceland, where many live beyond their means and the biggest shopping day of the month is the day after the credit card bills are issued. The bishop's love of the good life led him to be declared bankrupt. (The house is now a restaurant although the stories surrounding it are more interesting than the building itself.) </p> <p>There are a few rules to a night out in Reykjavik. First, dress up. This is a fashion-conscious city, and you're not going to get into many places unless you've made an effort - anoraks, cords and comfy jumpers just won't cut it. Second, take your credit cards or some serious cash: drinks are expensive. Mainly though, get used to being pushed around. If jostling were an Olympic sport, young Icelanders would come home bearing gold every time. They will lurch into you drunkenly, push past you to the bar or wherever else they want to go, dance on your table or on your feet without noticing. </p> <p>Patiently waiting to get into Kaffibarinn, the funky, fashionable and over-crowded bar part-owned by Blur's Damon Albarn, we protested to the doorman about queue-jumping. 'Here, it is the survival of the fittest,' he shrugged, and didn't object when one of our party subsequently shouldered past him. All of this can be uncomfortable at first, but relax, learn to dodge and you'll see that the activity is usually boisterous rather than aggressive. </p> <p>Our night started high up at Perlan (The Pearl), a spectacular glass dome built on top of a circle of shiny metal canisters storing some of the hot spring water that heats the city's homes and its seven outdoor swimming pools, leaving the airclear and unpolluted. Inside there's an artificial geyser that shoots up five storeys, a swish cocktail bar on the top floor, a revolving restaurant below it, and a caf\u00e9 with an outdoor balcony below that. There's no better place to watch the sun set into the sea, after which lights come on all over the dome, and you're sitting under your own artificial stars. </p> <p>There's no point in anything except a long, leisurely dinner afterwards. Alco hol is still prohibitively expensive, so most revellers enjoy a few drinks at home before going out, and the bars are dead until midnight. Indeed, with night action mainly limited to Friday and Saturday nights, most of them lead double lives: they are coffee houses and restaurants in the day, and on week nights the few that are open at all are often taken over for school dances. </p> <p>After midnight, it's really a matter of personal choice: the bars are nearly all on or just off Austurstraeti and Laugavegur, and it's normal to move to several in the course of a night: just follow the crowds, look through windows or listen to the music coming out of the open doors until you find something you like. We passed establishments playing funk, hip hop, salsa, jazz, techno and reggae, places that looked small and cosy, an Irish bar, an English pub, designer hang-outs and others that were satisfyingly seedy. </p> <p>We stopped several people in the street to ask for advice and directions, and though a few turned out to be too drunk to direct themselves, let alone a stranger, all were chatty, happy to help - and nearly all spoke excellent English. </p> <p>After an expensive but memorable seafood dinner at the upmarket and ultracool Ap\u00f3tek (Austurstraeti 16), we continued our bar crawl at Skuggabarinn (Shadow Bar) in Hotel Borg in P\u00f3sth\u00fasstraeti (the best hotel to stay in if you're planning a night out since it's right in the middle of the action, but the worst venue you could choose at weekends if you were thinking of sleeping). Catering to a mainly older, but very chic crowd, it's a big, comfortable old place full of oil paintings, velvet drapes and gilt mirrors with MTV flickering in one bar, a small dancefloor where they are playing up-to-the-minute American R&amp;B hits in another, and lots of cosy side rooms and alcoves with sofas and tables. Nearby Rex (9 Austurstraeti) is a modern bar/restaurant designed by Terence Conran catering to a similarly sophisticated crowd, most of them sitting at tables with an ice bucket of wine or champagne. </p> <p> Ten minutes walk away, some drunken students at the small, crowded two-tier Vegam\u00f3t (4 Vegam\u00f3tastig) shouted into my ear over the vintage funk and soul soundtrack with their own bizarre theory about the older crowd at these two establishments. Everyone there must be gay, insisted my new friend. Why would any women over the age of 25 or men over 30 want to go out, unless they were unable to marry and settle down? One of them also claimed to feature in Dancer In The Dark , the film starring Bj\u00f6rk which was advertised on posters all over town. He changed his story, however, on hearing I'd seen it, and loudly insisted instead that Bj\u00f6rk was, in any case, overrated. Many of the crowd seemed to spend as much time hunched over their mobiles as they did drinking, frantically text-messaging friends in other bars or those outside on the street, unable to find a fake ID to say they were 20 and old enough to buy drinks. </p> <p>After that, the night blurs. Kaffibarinn (1 Bergstadastraeti) was crowded but very cool, a two-storey house decorated with a huge London Tube symbol. Further back down the hill, Kaffi Thomsen (17 Hafnarstraeti) doesn't really warm up until 3am, when its cover charge goes up from 500 kr\u00f3na (\u00a34) to 1,000 and the banging techno and house mix starts to fill up the rough wooden dancefloor. When I asked when it closed, replies were vague. 'Whenever,' said one. 'Or maybe never.' </p> <p>By 4.30am, I'd had enough. Leaving most of our party waving their hands in the air like they just didn't care, two of us left for a delicious hotdog from the stalls near the shed-like Parliament Building, then took a slow walk back to our hotel. The air was crisp, clear and still, the night silent except for the hooting of swans on the lake by the ultra-modern City Hall. There are taxis everywhere, but few cities feel as safe to walk in at this time of night. Or as beautiful. </p> <p>\u0095 Sheryl Garratt travelled as a guest of Icelandair (020 7874 1000) which has 12 flights a week from Heathrow and daily flights from Glasgow to Reykjavik.

      "body": "<p> Lincoln's Christmas Market has grown from humble beginnings 19 years ago to become an event that attracts more than a quarter of a million visitors. The city's cobbled square plays host to more than 200 stalls selling almost every conceivable Christmas gift, with traders in Victorian costume and choirs performing carols, overlooked by the floodlit cathedral. The market opens on the evening of 7 December and runs daily until 10 December. Accommodation in the city itself can be tricky to find, although the Tourist Information Centre (01522 873213) has details of availability for miles around. </p> <p> Germany takes its Christmas markets seriously, with variations on the theme in most towns and cities. German Travel Centre (020 8429 2900) offers short-break packages to the big events including Cologne. The price of \u00a3137 per person includes one night in a standard-class hotel and return flights from Stansted; a first-class hotel would cost \u00a3147 pp, and flights are available from other airports. </p> <p>Centred around an ice rink in the medieval market square, the Christmas market in Bruges runs from 1 December to 2 January.

      "bodyText": "Lincoln's Christmas Market has grown from humble beginnings 19 years ago to become an event that attracts more than a quarter of a million visitors. The city's cobbled square plays host to more than 200 stalls selling almost every conceivable Christmas gift, with traders in Victorian costume and choirs performing carols, overlooked by the floodlit cathedral. The market opens on the evening of 7 December and runs daily until 10 December. Accommodation in the city itself can be tricky to find, although the Tourist Information Centre (01522 873213) has details of availability for miles around. Germany takes its Christmas markets seriously, with variations on the theme in most towns and cities. German Travel Centre (020 8429 2900) offers short-break packages to the big events including Cologne. The price of \u00a3137 per person includes one night in a standard-class hotel and return flights from Stansted; a first-class hotel would cost \u00a3147 pp, and flights are available from other airports. Centred around an ice rink in the medieval market square, the Christmas market in Bruges runs from 1 December to 2 January. Chalet-style stalls offer a good selection of gifts, ranging from sheepskin and woollens to jewellery, while the surrounding shops sell lace and chocolate. A three-night break, including one free night, with Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays (0870 3332001) costs \u00a3119 per person, based on two sharing, inclusive of return Eurotunnel crossing for car and passengers and bed and breakfast accommodation at the three-star Novotel Centrum Hotel.

But when Guy gave me 'The Monty Warm-Up' - a bag of 26 balls to allow golfers to practise a shot with each club from the sand wedge to the driver and back again - the oddest thing happened. </p> <p>I loosened my grip and swung back low and slow.

They pillaged Poland and Hungary and it seemed a matter of time before they reached the Atlantic. But then news came of the death of the great Khan Ogedei, and they returned to Mongolia.

      "body": "<p> Albert Tatlock - the morose, mustachioed old gent in Coronation Street, often to be seen squiring Ena Sharples in the Rover's Return in the good old days - is a name not normally associated with swishing down the ski slopes. He of the flat cap and tartan slippers and taste for brown ale is not the first image one conjures up when thinking of whizzing down the piste, or indulging in a little bit of apr\u00e8s ski. </p> <p>But at the resort of Les Deux Alpes in the French Alps last Easter, first-time skier Albert Tatlock could be spotted scorching down the slopes. No style, no finesse, but a certain dogged, grim resolution. And the flat cap. </p> <p>My oh my, how the bronzed Italians and French looked on enviously. They all sported super-trendy tiggly-toggly hats, long woolly excrescences that looked like sexy aerodrome wind-socks. </p> <p>'Oo is zat in the silly cap?' they cried, suppressing their deep-down envy for ultra cool Albert T. </p> <p>Oh, all right, it was me. </p> <p>Being bald as a thin-on-top coot, I had brought my Albert Tatlock cap from England, but had half a mind to buy some new, more trendy gear. It was all horribly expensive and naffly fashionable, so I stuck with Albert Tatlock. Next season, they'll all be wearing them, with, I'll wager, the women donning Ena Sharples hairnets. Apr\u00e8s toi, Albert. </p> <p>The trick to being a first-time skier is you have to want to not look cool. Don't look cool as you crash into yourself, as one pigeon-toed ski trips up another. Don't look cool as you slide slowly into the next first-timer, and crash into them. Don't look cool as you zoom over a crest and end up like a spread-eagled hedgehog which has run amok in a flour mill. Don't look cool, and it is wonderfully funny. And being in the mountains is just life-enhancing. The diamond-pure air, the sense of space, the gentle camaraderie of the first-timers as we fall into each other's arms, again and again. First on the slopes, and then in the bars. </p> <p>A single dad, I went with my two kids, Sam and Molly, and was worried whether they would have a good time and would be safe. Being children, they were perfect learners, supple and agile. The first move to learn is the snow-plough, a kind of pigeon-toes with attitude, and I was amazed to see seven-year-old Molly snow-plough down a mountain that I was far too scared to look at. </p> <p>Sam, too, whizzed past, yelling 'Come on, Dad' as he swished this way and that. Coming down a long run, he fell over once, and me four times. There is a word for this, and it is: irritating. </p> <p>Every age group has its class and teachers. For the first-time adults, we had Carlo, a super-fit Italian, irritatingly handsome but, sadly, he had no idea who Albert Tatlock was. I had him there. Carlo's main trick was to follow you down the mountain, shouting 'open your knees' and 'wider, wider, wider'. </p> <p>But, as with everything else, it's just a question of practice, and sticking at it. By the end of the week, I was zooming down slopes that had given me the heebie-jeebies at the start. </p> <p>Les Deux Alpes is not a very smart place, looking more like a Polish new town than a gorgeous resort. But it is high up, just below a glacier, so that skiing just before a late Easter was no problem. Lower down on the slopes, the snow was patchy. But up near the glacier there is snow all year, so much so that the snowboarders use it the year round. (Snowboarding looks enormous fun, but I think is much harder than skiing. One of the sadder sights of the slopes was the number of snowboarders looking miserably at nothing, having fallen over for the thousandth time.) </p> <p>Apr\u00e8s ski, it would be hard to fault the fun at the Crystal Holidays hotel, Le Brunerie. Meals and lashings of plonk were thrown in, and because it was the last week of the season, the staff were in a merry mood. Many of them are British students, having a year off, who are happy to play at being waiters or changing beds, so that they can spend five months on the slopes on their days off. All the kids had already made friends with each other on the slopes, so they were lost in themselves in the pool and Jacuzzi, discussing Harry Potter, PlayStation and, yes, snow-ploughs. </p> <p>The adults, on the other hand, discussed bruises, arthritis and alcohol abuse. The usual conversations. I wrote a play, performed by the kids, featuring James Bond, Dr Evil and Carlo, a sadistic ski instructor who shouted 'Open your knees, Mr Bond' to boos. </p> <p>The play was banned from the bar, for some odd reason, making me feel like Vaclav Havel. It went down incredibly well, even the Albert Tatlock jokes. </p> <p>Top holiday. If you haven't dared to go skiing, have a go.

      "body": "<p> The Beatle industry rocks on, hitting two anniversaries this autumn. John Lennon would have been 60 on 9 October, and on 8 December it will be 20 years since he was murdered. For reasons that lie somewhere beyond good taste, Yoko Ono has included the glasses he was wearing when he died and the Roosevelt Hospital bag containing his death clothes among the hundreds of items in an exhibition devoted to Lennon that opened last week at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, in Cleveland, Ohio. Meanwhile, a permanent Lennon museum has just opened its doors in Tokyo, suggesting that the diehard fan's credit card will be painfully squeezed in the coming months. </p> <p>The Ohio exhibition runs until next September. Here is the moody leather jacket from the red-light Hamburg days, and the naff collarless number that the fastidious Brian Epstein forced a reluctant Lennon to wear. There's the 'All You Need Is Love' frock coat, a Magical Mystery Tour costume, and the embarrassing 'Starting Over' kimono. There are dozens of scruffy, scribbled lyrics that changed people's lives. The shop-load of guitars include the 12-string Rickenbacker of the Beatle days, and the Telecaster he used in his last concert. His bed and his piano, artworks and ephemera, in addition to films, videos, lectures and events, make up a massive tribute. </p> <p>Rock Hall, as it is less cumbersomely known to Cleveland cabbies, is expert at such exercises. A Jimi Hendrix exhibit was up and running before Lennon opened, and I was recently invited over to help celebrate Muddy Waters in a week of loud music, films, lectures and ageing blues writers nattering their way from bar to bar. Waters followed Woody Guthrie, Jimmie Rodgers, Robert Johnson and Louis Jordan in Rock Hall's annual American Music Masters series. The reason for my involvement, as the token white Englishman at the event, was the publication in 1998 of my book The Story of Chess Records , a long fan letter to Muddy's record label. </p> <p>Although Cleveland by and large ignores the fact that it sits beside nearly 10,000 square miles of Lake Erie, the Hall of Fame is one building that does make the most of its waterfront setting. Walk gently downhill through the downtown area - and this is a city where a wandering Brit is not seen as a dangerous madman - and it is waiting in front of the sparkling lake. </p> <p>At its core is a tower, 162ft high, but it is the glass that takes the breath away - a vast tented pyramid, standing in a sculpted plaza. If a similar structure in the Louvre courtyard comes to mind, well spotted - Chinese architect I.M. Pei designed them both. From the air, my guide Santina Protopapa tells me, the plan of the building represents an old-fashioned record player. We both have to take Mr Pei's word for it. </p> <p>Rock Hall is educational and archival, but above all entertaining. In 1983 various music-business worthies created the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, an idea without bricks and mortar, to honour their heroes. Starting with Chuck Berry, they have been adding names ever since. </p> <p> The search for a permanent site began in 1986 and numerous cities put in bids, Cleveland won and opened for business in 1995. The huge basement museum, a roller-coaster ride through the history of rock, is an object lesson in how to nail rock'n'roll to a wall but still let it wriggle. Britney Spears isn't here, of course, but her fans can feel what made Elvis so dangerous, Howlin' Wolf so inspiring, Hendrix so revolutionary. </p> <p>Any museum that even remembers politico-rocker Phil Ochs, let alone has obtained the gold lam\u00e9 suit that he wore to tease his purist folk fans, has a lot going for it In the punk exhibit, a long way from home, I am con fronted with a death threat - an issue of Sniffin' Glue fanzine dedicated 'to John Collis - RIP'. It was prompted by something I once wrote about the musical intricacy of punk rock, no doubt. Upstairs, the Sun Studio equipment on which Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison created their uncanny noise is on display, together with constantly looped movies and rock videos ('Advisory: contains adult themes'). Higher still is an interactive juke-box stocked with 25,000 tracks, and a film show on rock history - this time the themes are 'mature'. At Rock Hall's summit, the significance of hip hop as today's blues is given due prominence. </p> <p>Until Rock Hall opened, Cleveland had an international reputation for two other cultural institutions. The Cleveland Orchestra plays at the baroque Severance Hall, at the east end of town across from the university. Behind the Hall, in elegant parkland, is the Cleveland Museum of Art, an architectural clash between 1916 neo-classicism and vast modern marble slabs. From ancient Greece to the US avant-garde, the artistic collisions inside are just as striking. </p> <p>Cleveland itself is caught halfway between its industrial past and its future as a cultural and educational centre. The relics of industry, on the west side, are so dominating that they have now achieved their own rusty grandeur. Traffic is fed in and out on a series of Brobdingnagian viaducts, spanning the twists of the Cuyahoga River. Beneath one of these, monumental in blue metal, huddles The Flats, centred on a street of bars and restaurants that pretend 1967 never ended. Each is decorated with hippy splashes of colour, announcing Crabs and Liquor and Fine Dining. </p> <p>In the Warehouse District, gaunt and windswept but showing signs that the loft-and-bistro generation is moving in, I found a rarity - a shop. Cleveland, by and large, prefers malls to shops, but this one advertised 'Newspapers and Magazines'. I entered in innocence, buying a copy of the world's dullest daily, the Cleveland Plain Dealer . I immediately realised that the newspaper business was a trivial sideline. This was a temple to gaudy videos of a specialist nature. At nine in the morning, some of the images make the eyes water. 'Have a nice day,' said the cheerful shopkeeper. 'Er, yes. Just browsing.' </p> <p>The two most imposing skyscrapers in the adjacent district, Tower City, have the dignity and detailing of a past age, more Empire State than Canary Wharf. Beneath the tallest is one of those 1930s granite civic halls that America excels at, each like a tiny Grand Central Station. Ten years ago it was extended backwards in the same architectural style, with waterfalls, elegant staircases and shops. </p> <p>Nearby is the gigantic revolving guitar of the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, and the baseball stadium where the Cleveland Indians play. Around here, pub rock lives. The former Band drummer Levon Helm, cheerful though gaunt in cancer remission, was at Fat Fish Blue while I was there, and the city's own Mississippi bluesman Robert Jr Lockwood, now in his mid-eighties, is a regular. A block east on Prospect Avenue SE, Baron's is one of half-a-dozen Cleveland bars giving the lie to the belief that Americans drink only Homer Simpson's Duff Beer. Baron's is a brew-pub, offering a wide choice from an authentic pilsner to a sweet, dark-brown ale. </p> <p>Bars like Baron's, with bluesmen on the balcony and beer bubbling in the basement, along with Rock Hall and the stunning Museum of Art, point a way forward for Cleveland now that its industrial base is shrinking. It must be admitted that the city is not a picturesque paradise, but as a stopover on a musical pilgrimage, moving on to the blues clubs of Chicago and maybe to Rock Hall's rival attraction, The Experience in Seattle, it is a rewarding and exciting town. </p> <p><strong>That's where the music takes me</strong></p> <p> <strong>The Motown Museum, Detroit </strong><br> Housed in the small, clapboard house which was a recording studio for the Tamla Motown artists in the 1960s, this museum pays homage to Motown's golden era.

      "body": "<p>Henry McLeish will this week be installed as First Minister of Scotland after narrowly winning the election yesterday to succeed Donald Dewar as Scottish Labour leader.</p> <p>After 10 days of speculation following Dewar's death from a brain haemorrhage, McLeish only just managed to beat off a challenge from Finance Minister Jack McConnell at a special meeting of MSPs and the party's executive in Stirling.</p> <p>The result destroyed confident earlier predictions from the McLeish camp that victory for their man was a formality. He secured only 44 of the 80 votes in the party's electoral college yesterday to McConnell's 36. McLeish supporters had claimed only 24 hours earlier that at least 50 votes were in the bag.</p> <p>More significantly, it is likely that McConnell won the support of at least half of the 54 MSPs, leaving Labour open to the Opposition's accusations that McLeish failed to secure a mandate to lead.</p> <p>Both camps sought to dispel any suggestion that the contest had left a lasting rift. With both men insisting the contest had strengthened the party, McConnell threw his support behind McLeish, while the new leader made it clear that there will be a job for the Finance Minister in the Executive.</p> <p>After the result was announced, McLeish, 52, said: 'We have tragedy behind us, but ahead of us this party has a tremendous future. My belief is that we can do that by working ahead as a team. It is a team that can deliver for Scotland.'</p> <p>He committed himself to taking forward Dewar's legacy by combating social exclusion, in particular child poverty and unemployment. He also promised to work more closely with Scottish Secretary John Reid and to fight Scotland's corner more forcefully in London. But the biggest challenge will be to pull the party together to fight the UK general election.</p> <p>McLeish, who was Enterprise Minister before yesterday's result, was the hot favourite to succeed Dewar with strong backing from the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. After serving for 13 years as an MP at Westminster, he is regarded by the Labour leadership in London as a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>But this close association with the London leadership may have damaged his support yesterday. In the aftermath of Dewar's death, it was suggested - with prompting from Downing Street - that McLeish should be installed unopposed as the new leader. This prompted a furious backlash from MSPs determined not to have the choice of leader dictated from London.</p> <p>McLeish will officially serve as interim leader until the full electoral college of the Scottish party has its say later in the year. But he is almost certain to be unopposed in that contest, with McConnell making clear yesterday that he will not stand again, despite the closeness of the result. He also ruled himself out of the deputy leadership because he wanted to continue as Finance Minister.</p> <p>'I said a week past Wednesday that Donald Dewar was irreplaceable,' he said. 'We have elected today a fine leader of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament and somebody who will be a very fine First Minister.'</p> <p>McConnell, who had spent the previous 48 hours on a gruelling whirlwind tour of Scotland, meeting MSPs and Executive members to drum up support, added: 'I thought it was vitally important that the party was given a democratic choice. I think the Labour Party and Scotland are stronger and I think the First Minister is stronger as a result.'</p> <p>Reid also dismissed claims the contest had divided the party. 'The fact that we have two such excellent candidates and such an open contest, far from in any way weakening the party, I believe strengthens Henry's position as leader of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament.'</p> <p>But John Swinney, the SNP's new leader, said: 'This is a disastrous result for Labour, and shows that they are split right down the middle. If only five people had voted the other way, Labour would be proposing a different First Minister next week, an absurd state of affairs.'</p> <p>The result is unlikely to have any impact on the coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the Executive. Jim Wallace, the Scottish Lib Dem leader and current Acting First Minister, congratulated McLeish on his victory.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Henry McLeish will this week be installed as First Minister of Scotland after narrowly winning the election yesterday to succeed Donald Dewar as Scottish Labour leader. After 10 days of speculation following Dewar's death from a brain haemorrhage, McLeish only just managed to beat off a challenge from Finance Minister Jack McConnell at a special meeting of MSPs and the party's executive in Stirling. The result destroyed confident earlier predictions from the McLeish camp that victory for their man was a formality. He secured only 44 of the 80 votes in the party's electoral college yesterday to McConnell's 36. McLeish supporters had claimed only 24 hours earlier that at least 50 votes were in the bag. More significantly, it is likely that McConnell won the support of at least half of the 54 MSPs, leaving Labour open to the Opposition's accusations that McLeish failed to secure a mandate to lead. Both camps sought to dispel any suggestion that the contest had left a lasting rift. With both men insisting the contest had strengthened the party, McConnell threw his support behind McLeish, while the new leader made it clear that there will be a job for the Finance Minister in the Executive. After the result was announced, McLeish, 52, said: 'We have tragedy behind us, but ahead of us this party has a tremendous future. My belief is that we can do that by working ahead as a team. It is a team that can deliver for Scotland.' He committed himself to taking forward Dewar's legacy by combating social exclusion, in particular child poverty and unemployment. He also promised to work more closely with Scottish Secretary John Reid and to fight Scotland's corner more forcefully in London. But the biggest challenge will be to pull the party together to fight the UK general election. McLeish, who was Enterprise Minister before yesterday's result, was the hot favourite to succeed Dewar with strong backing from the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. After serving for 13 years as an MP at Westminster, he is regarded by the Labour leadership in London as a safe pair of hands. But this close association with the London leadership may have damaged his support yesterday. In the aftermath of Dewar's death, it was suggested - with prompting from Downing Street - that McLeish should be installed unopposed as the new leader. This prompted a furious backlash from MSPs determined not to have the choice of leader dictated from London. McLeish will officially serve as interim leader until the full electoral college of the Scottish party has its say later in the year. But he is almost certain to be unopposed in that contest, with McConnell making clear yesterday that he will not stand again, despite the closeness of the result. He also ruled himself out of the deputy leadership because he wanted to continue as Finance Minister. 'I said a week past Wednesday that Donald Dewar was irreplaceable,' he said. 'We have elected today a fine leader of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament and somebody who will be a very fine First Minister.' McConnell, who had spent the previous 48 hours on a gruelling whirlwind tour of Scotland, meeting MSPs and Executive members to drum up support, added: 'I thought it was vitally important that the party was given a democratic choice. I think the Labour Party and Scotland are stronger and I think the First Minister is stronger as a result.' Reid also dismissed claims the contest had divided the party. 'The fact that we have two such excellent candidates and such an open contest, far from in any way weakening the party, I believe strengthens Henry's position as leader of the Labour Party in the Scottish Parliament.' But John Swinney, the SNP's new leader, said: 'This is a disastrous result for Labour, and shows that they are split right down the middle. If only five people had voted the other way, Labour would be proposing a different First Minister next week, an absurd state of affairs.' The result is unlikely to have any impact on the coalition between Labour and the Liberal Democrats on the Executive. Jim Wallace, the Scottish Lib Dem leader and current Acting First Minister, congratulated McLeish on his victory.",

      "body": "<p>There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy spending money if you've got it to spare, but watch out for tell-tale signs that it is getting out of control. </p> <p>One critical difference between shopping as fun and shopping as an addiction seems to be the lasting value ascribed to the purchase. </p> <p> 'If you use shopping as a way of dealing with feeling low and find that the act of buying is fun, but that when you get home you don't particularly want what you have bought, then you might want to reconsider what you do,' says economic psychologist Professor Paul Webley of Exeter University. </p> <p>These are questions you should ask yourself to see if you need to put your spending in perspective: </p> <p>\u0095 Are you unsure how much you are spending and on what? </p> <p>\u0095 Is your non-essential spending affecting your ability to pay essential bills? </p> <p>\u0095 Do you feel depressed after a shopping spree? </p> <p>\u0095 Is your spending a source of family/partner friction? </p> <p>If you answer 'yes' to one or more of the above questions you may want to look at your spending in more detail. These tips should help: </p> <p>\u0095 Do a proper budget and work out exactly how much you have to spend on luxuries after the essentials are taken care of. </p> <p>\u0095 Make a fresh start - clear the house of regretted purchases. </p> <p>\u0095 Plan your spending trips with more care - work out what you can afford to spend and have a good idea what you want to spend the money on. </p> <p>\u0095 Restrict your visits to shops and find other outlets for your leisure time (if you shop in your lunch hour join a gym instead). </p> <p>\u0095 When you go shopping, take a friend whose opinion you trust. </p> <p>If you have children, it is also worth thinking about what sort of example you are setting and how it may influence their ability to handle money. According to Webley the messages our society gives children about spending are mixed. On the one hand we have a consumerist system with lots of credit available; on the other, young people are being urged to save for the time when they retire, as the state will not be able to provide for them.</p> <p><strong>A spender and a borrower be </strong></p> <p><strong>The Homesters</strong></p> <p>Homesters have always been followers of fashion, but this has extended from their personal wardrobe into their home. In part, this reflects the fact that many Homesters now have children. Unable to pub and club to the same extent, they have developed their home into a stylish backdrop. </p> <p><strong>Advice:</strong> So long as your spending remains within your budget that's fine but watch those credit card bills and make sure tomorrow's savings and pensions are not being sacrificed to today's fashionable home purchase.</p> <p><strong>The Gadgets</strong></p> <p>Gadgets are suckers for the latest technological advance. Single Gadgets may pursue the latest digital whatnots with more abandon, but even couples with children can be Gadgets. Watch out for dads on microscooters outside the school gates. </p> <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Beware of first-generation gadgetry. It may be nice to be the first one on the block with the latest gizmo, but sometimes it takes the second or third generation of a new development to iron out all the bugs.

      "bodyText": "There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy spending money if you've got it to spare, but watch out for tell-tale signs that it is getting out of control. One critical difference between shopping as fun and shopping as an addiction seems to be the lasting value ascribed to the purchase. 'If you use shopping as a way of dealing with feeling low and find that the act of buying is fun, but that when you get home you don't particularly want what you have bought, then you might want to reconsider what you do,' says economic psychologist Professor Paul Webley of Exeter University. These are questions you should ask yourself to see if you need to put your spending in perspective: \u0095 Are you unsure how much you are spending and on what? \u0095 Is your non-essential spending affecting your ability to pay essential bills? \u0095 Do you feel depressed after a shopping spree? \u0095 Is your spending a source of family/partner friction? If you answer 'yes' to one or more of the above questions you may want to look at your spending in more detail. These tips should help: \u0095 Do a proper budget and work out exactly how much you have to spend on luxuries after the essentials are taken care of. \u0095 Make a fresh start - clear the house of regretted purchases. \u0095 Plan your spending trips with more care - work out what you can afford to spend and have a good idea what you want to spend the money on. \u0095 Restrict your visits to shops and find other outlets for your leisure time (if you shop in your lunch hour join a gym instead). \u0095 When you go shopping, take a friend whose opinion you trust. If you have children, it is also worth thinking about what sort of example you are setting and how it may influence their ability to handle money. According to Webley the messages our society gives children about spending are mixed. On the one hand we have a consumerist system with lots of credit available; on the other, young people are being urged to save for the time when they retire, as the state will not be able to provide for them. A spender and a borrower be The Homesters Homesters have always been followers of fashion, but this has extended from their personal wardrobe into their home. In part, this reflects the fact that many Homesters now have children. Unable to pub and club to the same extent, they have developed their home into a stylish backdrop. Advice: So long as your spending remains within your budget that's fine but watch those credit card bills and make sure tomorrow's savings and pensions are not being sacrificed to today's fashionable home purchase. The Gadgets Gadgets are suckers for the latest technological advance. Single Gadgets may pursue the latest digital whatnots with more abandon, but even couples with children can be Gadgets. Watch out for dads on microscooters outside the school gates. Advice: Beware of first-generation gadgetry. It may be nice to be the first one on the block with the latest gizmo, but sometimes it takes the second or third generation of a new development to iron out all the bugs.

      "body": "<p>Philip Pullman is an extraordinary writer who shares his surname with a train when he ought to be represented by a fantastical, winged vehicle. At the moment, though, what he needs is a winged pen. It takes him an entire day, each week, to answer fan letters. </p> <p>Adults and children alike have been bowled over by the first two books of His Dark Materials trilogy. His first book, Northern Lights, won the Carnegie Prize. His second, The Subtle Knife, was likened, in its ambition, to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. His work is demanding and unusual, children's literature at its best. His heroes make Harry Potter seem no more than a bumptious cartoon. J.K. Rowling encourages a jolly return to childhood; reading Pullman is not a 'return' to anything. He is sophisticated, metaphysical, unhackneyed. </p> <p>The Subtle Knife, published in 1997, ended in suspense. Since then, there has been in Pullman-fixated households a sense of expectation tinged with despair as he has missed one publishing deadline after another. When would he get his act together and finish the trilogy? By the time I met him, I was no longer complaining. I congratulated him at once on The Amber Spyglass, published on 1 November. </p> <p>It is a tremendous enterprise. Pullman country is no single place: he conjures parallel universes, like a possessed juggler. He is in command of the grand sweep and the tiniest of botanical details. I asked him about the world of the dead, which appears in the new book. Pullman proposes that each one of us has 'a death' that goes with us through life 'a meek, pale chaperone'. His world of the dead is a terrible, understated, monochrome place. </p> <p>I told him that I was scared by it - I longed to get out. Did my reaction worry him? 'No,' he said, visibly pleased. He wants his readers to value life. His living worlds are iridescent, populated with marvellous, outlandish creatures: shaggy blue bison, foxes which can only understand the present tense, angels with a taste for Kendal mint cake. But none of this is at the expense of our world. There will eventually be a return to reality, a second, gloriously reconstituted Fall. </p> <p>Pullman is an original but would be the last person to agree. He disarmingly claimed to have 'stolen ideas from every book I have ever read'. His heroes are Homer, Milton and Blake; Swift and Dickens are in there too. His landscapes tend to be romantic. His heroine, Lyra, is tomboyish, fearless. </p> <p>I told him that Lyra's mother Mrs Coulter (one of the most fascinating villains in children's literature) was my favourite character. She turned out to be his favourite, too. But even Mrs Coulter cannot compete with his boldest invention: daemons. A daemon is an alter-ego, a soulmate, the outward manifestation of an inner life. It can take any form: a butterfly, a snowy leopard, a barn owl. Children's daemons change all the time. An adult has one fixed daemon. What would his own daemon be?</p> <p>'You can't choose your daemon,' he replied hastily. 'You have to make the best of whatever you turn out to be.' His daemon would be a dolphin - for intelligence, agility - and also for a way of diving under subjects. In appearance, he could not be less like a dolphin. He looks like what he once was, a schoolteacher: tall, balding, bespectacled, in his fifties, with a comfortable, lively face. How much of the trilogy did he plan in advance? He said he had a sense of its overall 'architecture' and its ending but 'did not know what was going to happen on the way. What I am given is the story. What I have to contribute is my telling of it.' </p> <p>He was born in Norwich in 1946 in a service family. His father was in the RAF and posted abroad. 'We had no roots,' he said. He spent the early Fifties in southern Africa and Australia. But it was the travelling by boat across the world that helped to shape his imagination: it gave him a sense of the world on an epic scale. He savoured the remembered names: 'Las Palmas, Bombay, the Suez canal.' And he talked about the sea with gusto, almost as if it were in the room with us : 'It changes colour, the shapes of the waves change. That way of travelling is irreplaceable.' </p> <p>He spent his teens in North Wales, read English at Oxford (where he still lives) worked for a while at Moss Bross, 'an extraordinary experience' which he promises himself he will write about one day. He also worked as a librarian before training to become a teacher. Until he was 40, he taught in an Oxford middle school. He used to delight in telling them Greek myths. He also wrote school plays which he later adapted into novels. He would have been a friendly, occasionally fierce, teacher. He is glad he no longer teaches, saying that the national curriculum and the failure to trust teachers had 'destroyed everything that made teaching a pleasure'. </p> <p>Curiously, he describes himself as if he were not a writer either, but part of an oral tradition. He compares himself to a busking story-teller 'sitting on a carpet in a market place'. He likes to imagine people coming to 'sample' his stories. Those who enjoy them 'can stay and put coins in the hat'. He believes in the story-teller's power and told a tale to prove it. </p> <p>About 13 years ago, on a family holiday, it was his job to keep his five-year-old son, Tom, amused by telling him The Odyssey while waiting for supper to arrive: 'I'd wind up neatly as soon as I could see the food coming.' By the end of The Odyssey, 'Tom was sitting with a glass in his hand like this [Pullman pressed hard on the sides of an imaginary glass]. At the climax, he was so galvanised he bit a chunk out of the glass. That's the power of story-telling,' he concluded calmly, adding: 'Thank you Homer.' </p> <p>But not everyone who comes to sit on Pullman's carpet is inclined to put coins in his hat. He was described in the Catholic Herald as being 'far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter' and 'a million times more sinister'. This is nonsense, but not a surprising reaction. Pullman is an atheist with a mission. He describes science as the 'most successful achievement of the human race'.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he gave a remarkable speech called 'The Republic of Heaven' in which he succeeded in converting the words 'God is dead' into something positive. He refreshingly recruited Jane Eyre to his cause while giving Tolkien and C.S. Lewis the thumbs down for failing to salute the real world. He is not short of faith but it believes in humanity and in goodness, not in God. He believes we need this 'thing which I've called joy'. His is an engaging moral optimism. He laughs easily but has a stoical approach to everything that lies outside his control. The film rights for the trilogy have been sold. Did he fear his books would be ruined? 'No. Waste of time. Take the money and forget it. I have no power.' </p> <p>I asked him if reality seemed lacklustre after returning from his imagined worlds? 'No, the real world is better than stories.' I asked if he was able to live in the present, as his invented foxes do? He replied adamantly: 'There is no elsewhere.' But surely it is hard? 'Yes, but I believe in the absolute preciousness of the here and now. Here is where we are and now is where we live.' </p> <p> <strong> Philip Pullman: the facts</strong></p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> Norwich, 19 October 1946 </p> <p><strong> Backlist: </strong></p> <p>His Dark Materials Trilogy: </p> <p>Vol 1: Northern Lights (1995) <br>Vol 2: The Subtle Knife (1997) <br>Vol 3: The Amber Spyglass (2000) </p> <p>The Sally Lockhart Novels: </p> <p>The Ruby in the Smoke (1985) <br>The Shadow in the North (1986) <br>The Tiger in the Well (1991) </p> <p> <strong> Awards:</strong> </p> <p>1996: Carnegie Medal, Guardian Children's Fiction Award, British Book Award <br>1998: United Kingdom Reading Award <br>1988: International Reading Association Children's Book Award</p>",

What I have to contribute is my telling of it.' He was born in Norwich in 1946 in a service family. His father was in the RAF and posted abroad. 'We had no roots,' he said. He spent the early Fifties in southern Africa and Australia. But it was the travelling by boat across the world that helped to shape his imagination: it gave him a sense of the world on an epic scale. He savoured the remembered names: 'Las Palmas, Bombay, the Suez canal.' And he talked about the sea with gusto, almost as if it were in the room with us : 'It changes colour, the shapes of the waves change. That way of travelling is irreplaceable.' He spent his teens in North Wales, read English at Oxford (where he still lives) worked for a while at Moss Bross, 'an extraordinary experience' which he promises himself he will write about one day. He also worked as a librarian before training to become a teacher. Until he was 40, he taught in an Oxford middle school. He used to delight in telling them Greek myths. He also wrote school plays which he later adapted into novels. He would have been a friendly, occasionally fierce, teacher. He is glad he no longer teaches, saying that the national curriculum and the failure to trust teachers had 'destroyed everything that made teaching a pleasure'. Curiously, he describes himself as if he were not a writer either, but part of an oral tradition. He compares himself to a busking story-teller 'sitting on a carpet in a market place'. He likes to imagine people coming to 'sample' his stories. Those who enjoy them 'can stay and put coins in the hat'. He believes in the story-teller's power and told a tale to prove it. About 13 years ago, on a family holiday, it was his job to keep his five-year-old son, Tom, amused by telling him The Odyssey while waiting for supper to arrive: 'I'd wind up neatly as soon as I could see the food coming.' By the end of The Odyssey, 'Tom was sitting with a glass in his hand like this [Pullman pressed hard on the sides of an imaginary glass]. At the climax, he was so galvanised he bit a chunk out of the glass. That's the power of story-telling,' he concluded calmly, adding: 'Thank you Homer.' But not everyone who comes to sit on Pullman's carpet is inclined to put coins in his hat. He was described in the Catholic Herald as being 'far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter' and 'a million times more sinister'. This is nonsense, but not a surprising reaction. Pullman is an atheist with a mission. He describes science as the 'most successful achievement of the human race'. Earlier this year, he gave a remarkable speech called 'The Republic of Heaven' in which he succeeded in converting the words 'God is dead' into something positive. He refreshingly recruited Jane Eyre to his cause while giving Tolkien and C.S. Lewis the thumbs down for failing to salute the real world. He is not short of faith but it believes in humanity and in goodness, not in God. He believes we need this 'thing which I've called joy'. His is an engaging moral optimism. He laughs easily but has a stoical approach to everything that lies outside his control. The film rights for the trilogy have been sold. Did he fear his books would be ruined? 'No. Waste of time. Take the money and forget it. I have no power.' I asked him if reality seemed lacklustre after returning from his imagined worlds? 'No, the real world is better than stories.' I asked if he was able to live in the present, as his invented foxes do? He replied adamantly: 'There is no elsewhere.' But surely it is hard? 'Yes, but I believe in the absolute preciousness of the here and now. Here is where we are and now is where we live.'

Hilary Armstrong, the Local Government Minister, and her Lib Dem opposite number, Don Foster, have begun working on proposals for discussion at a senior level.</p> <p>The news come as publication of Paddy Ashdown's memoirs next week is expected to reveal just how close he and Blair came to forming a coalition in the run-up to the 1997 election - discussing a pact right up to polling day. The memoirs will detail how their friendship was forged as far back as 1983, when both were new MPs who discovered they had ideas in common.</p> <p>Ashdown will also reveal that his wife Jane knew of his affair with his secretary before it was exposed by newspapers and had 'come to terms with it' privately. Although Ashdown said yesterday that he was 'not bitter' about the press, friends say the diaries will portray a man under 'relentless, remorseless' pressure, from revelations about his sex life to death threats from far right groups.</p> <p>Ashdown said he had published the diaries because he passionately believed in the Lib-Lab project 'and believed it should be put on record'. While the relationship has become more discreet under his successor, Charles Kennedy, the latest initiative shows ardour has not cooled.</p> <p>'I think the mood has undoubtedly changed - there is less antagonism towards PR for local government,' said one senior Liberal Democrat source.</p> <p>'They are obviously very keen to get sorted on modernising local government and this would not be an unhelpful addition - although there will be one or two people in the Cabinet fighting a strong rearguard action.'</p> <p>Blair is understood to have told Kennedy that electoral reform could be useful for reinvigorating local government and preventing sleaze scandals such as those in Doncaster, where five councillors have been jailed.</p> <p>Mandelson recently told a meeting chaired by the Insti tute for Public Policy Research that he supported PR in local government. But Armstrong's boss, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, opposes further co-operation with the Lib Dems.</p> <p>The Armstrong-Foster paper on governance from parish council level to Brussels will be drawn up for the joint constitutional committee, the talking shop for senior Labour and Lib Dem politicians on closer co-operation.</p> <p>PR in Westminster elections has been shelved for now for fear of a mass revolt in the Labour Party. But senior party figures believe reform in local elections would be less problematic: forms of PR are already used in Scotland, Wales, London and European elections.</p> <p>The first instalment of the diaries covers the period until polling day. Potentially explosive revelations about how Ashdown was offered jobs in a Blair Cabinet post-election, only for Blair to back down after deciding it was too risky, are set to be published in the second volume next autumn.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has authorised secret talks with the Liberal Democrats on electoral reforms that would shatter Labour's stranglehold on local government. The threat to the party's grip on its town hall powerbases will infuriate some senior Ministers and grassroots activists alike. But senior figures including Peter Mandelson are backing the move, which would not only help to keep the Lib Dems on board but is increasingly seen in Downing Street as a solution to Labour's embarrassing 'rotten boroughs'. Long-term domination of councils by a single party in areas where it is very strong are thought to have fostered complacency, inefficiency and even corruption among some councillors facing too few checks from a weak opposition. Moving from a first-past-the-post voting system to a modified form of proportional representation for electing local councillors would force them to share power with Lib Dems and others. Hilary Armstrong, the Local Government Minister, and her Lib Dem opposite number, Don Foster, have begun working on proposals for discussion at a senior level. The news come as publication of Paddy Ashdown's memoirs next week is expected to reveal just how close he and Blair came to forming a coalition in the run-up to the 1997 election - discussing a pact right up to polling day. The memoirs will detail how their friendship was forged as far back as 1983, when both were new MPs who discovered they had ideas in common. Ashdown will also reveal that his wife Jane knew of his affair with his secretary before it was exposed by newspapers and had 'come to terms with it' privately. Although Ashdown said yesterday that he was 'not bitter' about the press, friends say the diaries will portray a man under 'relentless, remorseless' pressure, from revelations about his sex life to death threats from far right groups. Ashdown said he had published the diaries because he passionately believed in the Lib-Lab project 'and believed it should be put on record'. While the relationship has become more discreet under his successor, Charles Kennedy, the latest initiative shows ardour has not cooled. 'I think the mood has undoubtedly changed - there is less antagonism towards PR for local government,' said one senior Liberal Democrat source. 'They are obviously very keen to get sorted on modernising local government and this would not be an unhelpful addition - although there will be one or two people in the Cabinet fighting a strong rearguard action.' Blair is understood to have told Kennedy that electoral reform could be useful for reinvigorating local government and preventing sleaze scandals such as those in Doncaster, where five councillors have been jailed. Mandelson recently told a meeting chaired by the Insti tute for Public Policy Research that he supported PR in local government. But Armstrong's boss, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, opposes further co-operation with the Lib Dems. The Armstrong-Foster paper on governance from parish council level to Brussels will be drawn up for the joint constitutional committee, the talking shop for senior Labour and Lib Dem politicians on closer co-operation. PR in Westminster elections has been shelved for now for fear of a mass revolt in the Labour Party. But senior party figures believe reform in local elections would be less problematic: forms of PR are already used in Scotland, Wales, London and European elections. The first instalment of the diaries covers the period until polling day. Potentially explosive revelations about how Ashdown was offered jobs in a Blair Cabinet post-election, only for Blair to back down after deciding it was too risky, are set to be published in the second volume next autumn.",

'When you are writing for children,' he told the Bookseller in 1996, 'the story is more important than you are. You can't be self-conscious, you just have to get out of the way.' Because it is easier to write description and dialogue than tell a good story, very many contemporary novelists write bad plots - bad plots that are full of inexplicable lacunae and wonky motivation.

Look at it where you like - it is seamless. </p> <p>It's in the importance he attaches to narrative that sets Pullman apart from all those highly-praised contemporary writers who cannot plot for toffee. And, one might add, it is this that puts him squarely alongside J.K. Rowling, another popular writer for children whose appeal transcends her chosen genre. Pullman, however, is far superior to Rowling. As well as giving his readers stories that tick with the precision, accuracy and grace of an eighteenth-century clock, he also writes like an angel. </p> <p>He may never win the Booker Prize - more's the pity - but he gives his readers precisely the satisfactions they look for in a novel: well-made, absorbing characters, supreme elegance of style and tone, a richly inventive imaginative landscape, and, finally, some very big ideas fearlessly explored. It's not too much to ask, but it's rarer than hen's teeth.

The deal, which will delight the 84 families whose lives have been blighted by the disease, is set to be announced on Thursday, along with the publication of Lord Phillips's long-awaited report on the BSE crisis that has stalked Britain since the Eighties. Senior Whitehall sources said that, although there were still practical and legal difficulties that needed to be overcome, the Cabinet committee set up to deal with the Phillips report has agreed a no-fault scheme that will pay families hundreds of thousands of pounds. The source made it clear it was being seen as moral issue whether Lord Phillips says the Government is directly liable for the BSE disaster. Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, is said to have put his weight behind the compensation scheme. So far 73 people have died from new variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (nvCJD), which has been directly linked to eating beef infected with BSE. Another 11 people are thought to be suffering from the disease. David Body, the solicitor representing victims' families, welcomed the news. 'We will have to wait and see the details, but if the Government is to establish a no-fault compensation scheme then it would be doing what is right and proper. Farmers have been compensated, the meat industry has been compensated, but many people who have lost children or members of their families have so far not received a penny.' Billy McIntyre of Aberdeen, whose 21-year-old daughter Donna is dying of new variant CJD, said: 'It would be brilliant news and help us out incredibly. A government was to blame and this one should support us.' The Government has been grappling with the compensation issue for months. Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, and Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, have been set against Treasury officials concerned that payments will set a precedent that could expose the Government to unlimited liability. 'Nick and Alan have been fighting like tigers for this,' the Whitehall source said. Although there were initial fears that the number of people who might contract new variant CJD from eating infected beef would run into six figures, recent studies suggest the figure could be as low as 6,000. Even so, government officials were initially reluctant to offer compensation. Earlier this month there was a furious row after a leaked Whitehall memo suggested Ministers would fight any compensation claims. The Cabinet memo stated 'that there will be no payment of compensation without proof of legal liability.' It also said: 'There will be considerable pressure on the Government to accept the inquiry findings and apportion blame... but to do so would be to risk incurring unforeseeably large expenditure, depending on the scale of human disease, for which there would otherwise be no legal grounds.' But with victims' families ready to go to court, the Prime Minister was advised of the huge political damage a lengthy court case would do. Clare Callaghan from Belfast, whose 30-year-old husband Maurice died from new variant CJD in 1995, has been struggling to bring up two children by herself. She said: 'It would be wonderful news if there was compensation without us having to go through court and bring back the tragedy again. We have been surviving on my husband's pensions but it has been very difficult.' The Human BSE Foundation which speaks for victims' families has been calling for compensation to include a care package to help relatives look after those suffering from new variant CJD.

      "byline": "Nigel Slater",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I am convinced that a recipe should not be a set of rules to be followed to the letter for a mind-numbingly uniform result, but when I hear someone praising a recipe because it always works, my heart sinks a little. I believe a recipe should be treated as a living thing, something allowed to breathe, to change its nature to suit our ingredients, our mood and our desires. </p> <p>Have new cooks really come to rely on a set of regimented, foolproof orders that forbid them to use their own gut instincts? To me, there are few greater pleasures than cooking without being glued to a recipe, following our own instincts and common sense. Do not ignore those thousands of recipes published every year - there is much fun to be had with them - but I want to suggest, actually to beg, that sometimes we should use them lightly, instead following our own hunches. </p> <p>I want to encourage you to take in the spirit of the recipes that follow, but then to deviate according to your ingredients and your feelings, to understand that our ingredients and our hunger are variables that should not, cannot, be subjected to a set of formulas laid down in stone. I want to get you to break the rules. I want you to follow your appetite. </p> <p> You know what you like and what you don't. When shopping, you don't even bother to try some things on. Other things you dither over and reject. Other times you know, positively, instantly, instinctively, that something is right. Well, cooking can be just like that. </p> <p>A recipe is only telling you about someone else's taste. The writer is not allowing for your own. This is why I get exasperated with the more pedantic branch of the cookery-writing world that insists, 'This is the ultimate recipe, and this is how it must be done, otherwise it is just not right.' What they mean is that they have done this recipe over and over again and they think it is delicious and want you to try it, too. Fair enough. But to assume that their word is law is ridiculous - not to say downright arrogant. Don't be bullied by recipe writers. Listen to what they have to say - they know the pitfalls and also the fun to be had cooking - but trust your own taste, too. If you like the taste of a recipe as it is and the next line says, 'Add 300ml more cream', don't be bullied into adding the extra cream. Taste continually as you cook, and trust that taste. The crux of the matter is that it may be their recipe, but it is your supper. </p> <p> I have never believed in the foolproof recipe. It simply doesn't exist. No recipe can take into account what I call 'the variables'. How can any recipe tell you to cook a piece of fish for four minutes, then turn it over and cook the other side for two minutes longer? How does the recipe writer know how thick your pan is, the pressure of your gas, your version of moderate or high or simmer or stir? How do they know the accuracy of every oven, the thickness of your every cake tin, the nuances of every pot, pan and cooker? More importantly, how can that recipe assume to know the exact nature of your piece of fish? Telepathy? </p> <p>The fact is that food varies, and that is what makes it so interesting. Today's piece of cod may be slightly thicker than yesterday's. One brand of butter may differ from another. Olive oil changes with every bottle; that is part of its joy. So how can anyone be so pedantic as to give exact timings? Each egg, each steak, each potato is different and will behave in a different way in the pan. That is what cooking is about, and that is why it is essential to understand what you are doing rather than just mindlessly following a recipe. </p> <p> While some people like the 'certainty' that comes from following an exact recipe, others rarely bother with them. How many times do you hear someone say, 'I just throw it all together and it always seems to work out fine'? This does not always mean that they are experienced cooks - it may be more that they have an instinct for what might go with what. They may also have read or heard that x is good with y, or vaguely recall something they once ate. Whatever sort of cook you are there is nothing quite so rewarding as following your instincts and finding they pay off. </p> <p> There is a branch of cookery I called Cluttered Cooking. By this I mean recipes that are so choc-a-bloc full of ingredients and seasoning that the main ingredient itself has been lost. I find a lot of so-called fusion food suffers from this, as does some classical French cookery. I prefer the marriage of a few, intelligently chosen ingredients rather than a mishmash of everything in the cupboard. </p> <p>All the recipes in this book are a result of the pared-down approach. When people say they must follow a recipe, I often wonder if it is because they have not grasped the idea of less is more - the approach where just one or two ingredients are added to fish or meat or a vegetable to which they are perfectly suited. </p> <p>Whereas I would never wish to undermine the harmonious mixture of spices that work to flavour a curry sauce, say, I think we need to ask why we are adding something. What will it add and, frankly, what is its point? Anybody who doubts me need only roast a dish of slightly tart, green-speckled tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt, whole garlic and black pepper, then compare it with one to which they have added aubergines, peppers, onions, courgettes, tomato sauce and oregano. One taste of the pared-down, uncluttered flavour of a roast tomato, its sweet-sharp, thin juices clean and unadulterated, and you will wonder why anyone would ever even consider making ratatouille.</p> <p><strong> A fishcake to console</strong> </p> <p> There is something peaceful and faintly reassuring about a fishcake. Old-fashioned food that reminds us of less frantic times. It is not for the sake of convenience that fishcakes are made with equal amounts of potato to fish. It is simply that the ratio seems right: not enough potato and the cakes lack substance, too much and they lack flavour. As alway s, it is up to us to nudge the two to make the recipe our own. Enough for 4-6. </p> <p><strong> 500g potatoes</strong> <br> <strong>500g salmon, haddock, cod, hake or any large-flaked white fish </strong> <br> <strong>milk for baking the fish in </strong> <br> <strong>a little flour for coating </strong> <br> <strong>butter and oil for frying </strong> <br> <strong>a large glass of white wine, not too dry</strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of tarragon </strong> <br> <strong>1 medium carton (about 300ml) cream</strong> </p> <p> Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Peel the potatoes and cut them into large chunks, then boil them to tenderness in salted water. Meanwhile, put the fish into a baking dish, almost cover with milk - you can add a bay leaf or two if you like - then bake until the fish is opaque and will come easily from the bone or skin when you pull it. You can expect this to take about 10 to 15 minutes, bearing in mind that different types of fish take slightly different times to cook. </p> <p>Drain the potatoes, putting them back into the empty pan over a moderate heat for a few minutes if they seem wet, then mash them with a potato masher. Lift the fish from its milk, reserving the liquid, then pull the flakes away from the bones and skin. Tip the fish into the mashed potato, add salt and grind over some black pepper - if you wish to add any of the additional seasonings below, do so now - and mix briefly and gently, so as not to crush the flakes of fish too much. </p> <p>Shape the mixture into patties, as large or small as you like (I favour ones the size of a digestive biscuit and the thickness of an English muffin), coating each one lightly in flour as you go. I think you should avoid the temptation to err towards perfection. Wobbly cooking has a certain charm about it. </p> <p>Melt a little butter and oil in a frying pan (you need enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and fry your cakes till they are softly golden. This should take no more than a couple of minutes on each side. Keep them hot in a low oven. </p> <p>Wipe the pan out with kitchen paper, add the glass of wine and let it bubble down over a high heat until there are just a few tablespoons left; strip the tarragon leaves from their stems and drop them into the wine as it bubbles. Pour in the cream and a wine glassful of the fish milk and bring to the boil, turning it down to a fierce simmer so it thickens somewhat. Season with salt and pepper, then pour it over the fishcakes. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Some good things to add to your fishcakes</strong> <br> Chopped, vivid-green parsley leaves; 5 or 6 mashed anchovies; a few shakes of anchovy sauce; chopped tarragon leaves; chopped dill; chopped leeks cooked in butter till soft. </p> <p> <strong> A chilli-hot, citrus-scented fishcake </strong><br> Forget the potatoes. Skin the fish (500g will be enough for 4 people). Blitz 2 spring onions, 2 cloves of garlic, a couple of small, seeded red chillies and 6 lime leaves together with a handful of coriander leaves in a food processor to make a thick sludge. Mix in 1 tbsp of nam pla (Thai fish sauce) and tip it into a bowl. Whiz the fish to a coarse paste, then mix it with the seasonings and shape into small cakes. Some flour on your hands will be useful here. Fry till golden brown. </p> <p> <strong> A smoked fishcake </strong><br> The smoky flavour of cured haddock, Arbroath smokies or even smoked salmon makes a beautiful, rather homely tasting fishcake, reminiscent of Victorian high tea. It is flattered enormously by a cream and parsley sauce (simply substitute parsley for the tarragon above, then whiz the sauce in a blender). Cured haddock and smokies will need cooking in milk, as above. Smoked trout or salmon can be added directly to the potato. </p> <p> <strong> Tinned-fish fishcakes </strong><br> Lovely. Canned salmon and sardines make deeply flavoured fishcakes. You will need the same quantity as fresh fish, and you will have to drain them of their oil or water. Squeeze wedges of lemon over. </p> <p> <strong> Little prawn cakes </strong><br> Make these in the same way as the chilli-hot cakes above but using defrosted cooked prawns. I sometimes add a dollop of mayonnaise and a little flour - the mayonnaise adding lusciousness, the flour holding the fragile little cakes in one piece. </p> <p> <strong> Chicken, garlic, herbs - a simple supper</strong> </p> <p> If we are to eat well, we need to know how to exploit every bit of flavour in our food. The idea that follows does exactly that. Meat is cooked slowly on the bone over a low to moderate heat so that, as it tenderises, it leaves a thin film of goo - the caramelised meat juices - with which we can make a sauce (when I say sauce, I mean something quite thin and meagre in quantity, but intensely flavoured rather than a copious creamy blanket). </p> <p>There is something neat about this recipe, and I am not talking about its frugal use of kitchen equipment, though that is another point in its favour. The shopping list, as always, is short. The method is straightforward, undemanding. Spinach or courgettes, briefly boiled and tossed with butter and lemon juice, and some French bread for mopping your plate might be good here. Enough for 4. </p> <p><strong> free-range chicken - either a small bird, jointed by the butcher, or 2 chicken pieces per person, skin and bones to remain in place</strong> <br> <strong>olive oil </strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter </strong> <br> <strong>6 large, sweet cloves of garlic </strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of parsley, plus tarragon, thyme or chervil </strong> <br> <strong>a large wine glass of white wine or dry vermouth </strong> </p> <p>Rub the chicken all over with a little oil and some black pepper. In a large pan - it can be high-sided or shallow but it must have a lid - warm enough olive oil to give a small puddle in the bottom, then add the butter. Once the butter starts to froth, put in the chicken pieces and keep the heat moderately high while they colour. A pale and relatively even gold is what you are after. </p> <p>Meanwhile, put the whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a board and, with the flat blade of a knife, squash them so they flatten but remain fairly intact. Throw them in with the chicken. Turn down the heat so the fat under the chicken is gently fizzing, then add a little sea salt, cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat. The time it takes to cook will depend on the thickness of your chicken joints, but expect them to need about 40 minutes. You will have to turn them during cooking so they colour on all sides. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pluck the leaves from the herbs and chop them roughly. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish or warm plates, then fish out the garlic (although the garlic has done its work, it may be tender and sweet and is worth adding to the plate, though the skin should be discarded at some point). Tip off most of the fat from the pan - what you are after is the golden, caramelised juice stuck to the bottom - then turn up the heat, pour in the wine and add the herbs and let it bubble. Scrape away at any stuck bits in the pan, encouraging them to dissolve into the wine with a wooden spoon. Let this all bubble away for a minute or two until you have a thin liquor. It should be pale and interesting. Now taste the juice for seasoning - it may need salt, pepper or a squeeze of lemon juice - and spoon it over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> A buttery finish </strong><br> Once the wine has bubbled down, whisk in a thick slice of butter (about 50g), cut into tiny cubes. Taste and spoon over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> Or a creamy one </strong><br> Once you have removed the chicken from the pan and poured in your wine or vermouth, let it bubble away until you have only half of it left, then add about half as much cream. As it continues to bubble, stir in chopped parsley and slightly less chopped tarragon. Finish with salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p> <p> <strong> Lamb with garlic and lemon </strong> <br>What works for a chicken thigh will also work for a lamb chop. Try the original idea but with chump chops and adding parsley and mint. Finish with the squeeze of a lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Pork chops with apple and cream </strong><br> Rib chops, with their generous marbling of integral fat (rather than a loin chop with its great wodge of fat running alongside the lean meat), are delectable cooked this way. You should let them colour well before turning down the heat, adding an apple or two, peeled and cut into small cubes, and letting it colour with the pork. When it is time to take out the meat, leave the apple be, then add the wine and let it simmer down a bit before pouring in a small pot of double cream. Stir, taking the sediment from the pan with you and dissolving it into the cream with your wooden spoon. Herbs are not really needed here, though the garlic is. I once crushed a few juniper berries, adding them after the meat and fruit had browned, to great effect. </p> <p> <strong> A no-fuss puff-pastry vegetable pie</strong> </p> <p> I have never understood why some people come over all sniffy about ready-made puff pastry. It is a perfectly good commercial product - light, crisp and a joy for people like me who imagine they have better things to do than make their own. (Shortcrust is different altogether because they never put enough butter in the commercial stuff and anyway, it's as easy as toast to make.) You can buy prepared puff pastry chilled or frozen and now made with butter instead of vegetable fat. But the best invention must be puff pastry that is ready rolled and cut to size. The sort that comes in a long, thin rectangle is the most useful of all - it can become a pie or a millefeuille in the time it takes you to find the rolling pin, though you might like to roll it just a tiny bit thinner, so it becomes even lighter and crisper. Enough for 4. </p> <p> <strong>5 medium-sized onions </strong><br> <strong>enough butter or oil to cover the bottom of a medium-sized shallow pan</strong> <br> <strong>350g of any firm variety of mushrooms, or a mixture </strong><br> <strong>chopped thyme, lemon thyme or oregano (just enough to sit in the palm of your hand)</strong><br> <strong>about 200g cr\u00e8me frache </strong> <br> <strong>425g puff pastry</strong> <br> <strong>a little beaten egg or milk to glaze the pastry </strong> </p> <p> Peel and roughly chop the onions and let them cook slowly with the butter or oil over a low heat for 20 minutes or so, until they are golden, soft and almost transparent. Tear or slice the mushrooms into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to the onions, adding a little more butter or oil if they soak it all up. Leave them to turn golden and tender but stir them from time to time so they do not stick and burn. Season them with the chopped herbs and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache, grinding in a little salt and pepper as you go. You want a mixture that is creamy rather than runny, so let it bubble for a minute or two to thicken. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. The pastry needs to be rolled into two rectangles about 35cm by 20cm (conveniently the same measurements as the ready-rolled frozen stuff). Lay one piece on a lightly floured baking sheet and spread the mushrooms and onions over, leaving a good finger-thickness of bare rim around the edge. Brush a little beaten egg, milk or even water around the rim, lay the second rectangle of pastry over the top and squeeze the rims together to seal. It is worth being zealous about pinching the pastry - there shouldn't be any possibility of the filling escaping. Brush with more of the beaten egg or milk so the pastry will take on a rich golden shine in the oven, then cut a few little holes in the top to let out the steam. </p> <p>Bake the pie until it has puffed up like a cushion and is the colour of honey. This should take about 25 minutes. It is worth sneaking a look at the bottom to check if the pastry is crisp underneath (it should be fine, because this is not an especially wet filling). </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong>Some other good things </strong><br> There is magic, at least there is for me, in the bringing together of mushrooms, cream and puff pastry, but there are other fillings you can try here, too. </p> <p> <strong> A Gorgonzola and broccoli pie </strong><br> If broccoli ever seems just that bit too 'good for you', you can always take the smugness off its face by mixing it with cream and cheese. It works well in a pie like this in place of mushrooms. Cook the florets briefly, drain them, then fold them in with the onions and cr\u00e8me frache above. As we're lacking the savoury note of the mushrooms, I suggest some cheese - a blue, perhaps, such as a creamy Gorgonzola, a little Roquefort or Cashel Blue from Ireland. </p> <p> <strong> Garlic, cream and potato pie </strong><br> If you have any leftover pommes dauphinoise, I suggest you add a few softened onions and stuff it all between two sheets of pastry as in the pie above. I know potatoes in pastry sounds like a carbohydrate overdose but the effect is softened by the garlic-scented cream and buttery onions. Pushing your fork through golden, flaking pastry and slices of melting, cream-sodden potato is utter bliss. </p> <p> <strong> Pumpkin pie (but not that pumpkin pie) </strong><br> When I say pumpkin pie, I mean a savoury one with onions and cream, not the bland, over-rated tart that I have never managed to get the hots for. Peel a small pumpkin, cut it into chunks and roast with a generous amount of butter. When the golden flesh is soft and sweetly caramelised, add it to the softened onions above with the cr\u00e8me frache and a very little ground cinnamon. Pile it on to the pastry and top as usual. Great as a side dish for sausages. </p> <p> <strong> A thin, crisp fruit tart</strong> </p> <p> There are, I would venture, few more tempting sights than a baking tray of crisp, flaky fruit tarts fresh out of the oven. If you make your own pastry (and why not, if you have the time and the patience?), they will be sublime, but even with shop-bought puff pastry they are pretty fine. The trick is to roll the pastry as thin as you dare and bake them in a very hot oven. To get them at their most pleasurable, eat them warm, with cream or vanilla ice cream, so you get a mouthful of crisp, hot pastry, luscious fruit and cold ice cream all at once. Enough for 6. </p> <p><strong> 340g pack of defrosted puff pastry or a 425g pack of ready rolled </strong> <br> <strong>4 fairly tart dessert apples</strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter, melted </strong> <br> <strong>a little caster sugar</strong> </p> <p> Get the oven really hot. I set mine at 230 C/ gas mark 8. Roll the pastry out as thin as you can without actually being able to see through it. If the tarts are to be crisp and flaky, the pastry should be no thicker than a pound coin. If you have bought ready-rolled puff pastry, then roll it out just a little more. </p> <p>Using a large saucer or small side plate as a template, cut out six discs of pastry. Using something smaller (a cup, say), score a slightly smaller circle within each one so you have a small rim. This will rise and hold in the apples. Slide the pieces of pastry on to a baking sheet, then prick the centre circles of pastry all over with a fork, which will stop them puffing up too much in the oven and throwing the apples off. </p> <p>Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and carve out their cores, then slice them thinly. Arrange the slices on the pastry discs (I like to do this in rather formal, overlapping circles). Brush the apples and pastry with melted butter, then dust them with a fine layer of sugar - anything more generous would make the tarts too sweet. Bake them until the pastry is golden and is fully crisp underneath, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before eating. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Leftover pastry </strong><br> Parsimonious cooks will no doubt want to use the scraps of leftover pastry. My suggestion is to brush them with melted butter and dust them with grated Parmesan, then bake as above and eat while still hot and crisp. Frankly, I don't bother. We are only talking about a few scraps of pastry. </p> <p> <strong> A large apple tart </strong><br> There is something rather territorial about having your own fruit tart. If you prefer one large one to put on the table and cut up between your friends, then use one sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry, score a thin border around the edge, prick the centre and lay overlapping slices of apple, as thin as you can cut them, all over. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar and bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A cheese and apple tart </strong><br> When you have brushed the tarts above with the butter, scatter a fine layer of finely grated Parmesan over them and bake as above. Neither a starter nor a pudding, this. More of a snack, really. </p> <p> <strong> Pear tarts </strong><br> Pears can produce the finest tarts of all, possessing a lusciousness that apples lack. The trick is to cook the fruit slightly beforehand so its flesh is soft and juicy. This is easy. Make up enough sugar syrup to cover the peeled, halved and cored pears (just put the pears in a pan, cover them with water and tip in a cupful of sugar), then simmer till they are tender to the point of a knife. Lift them out, drain them briefly, then slice thinly and overlap the slices on the pastry. Brush them with some of the sugar syrup, then bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A banana tart </strong><br> Cut out and prick the tarts as above. Cut six bananas into slices as thick as pound coins, then divide them between the pastries. Brush them, and the pastry edges, with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. After 10 minutes or so in the oven, brush the tarts with melted apricot jam, then return them to the oven for a few minutes more. Eat hot, offering everyone the cream jug or a ball of vanilla ice. </p> <p> <strong> Apricot tarts</strong><br> Crisp pastry and juicy fruit. Use tinned apricots, or halve, stone and poach some fresh ones in a little sugar and water. Drain them well, then lay them on the pastry, cut side up, and bake till the edges are just caught and the pastry crisp. Since they are so heavy with juice, you may find you need neither ice cream nor cream. They are rich enough as it is.</p> <p> Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am convinced that a recipe should not be a set of rules to be followed to the letter for a mind-numbingly uniform result, but when I hear someone praising a recipe because it always works, my heart sinks a little. I believe a recipe should be treated as a living thing, something allowed to breathe, to change its nature to suit our ingredients, our mood and our desires. Have new cooks really come to rely on a set of regimented, foolproof orders that forbid them to use their own gut instincts? To me, there are few greater pleasures than cooking without being glued to a recipe, following our own instincts and common sense. Do not ignore those thousands of recipes published every year - there is much fun to be had with them - but I want to suggest, actually to beg, that sometimes we should use them lightly, instead following our own hunches. I want to encourage you to take in the spirit of the recipes that follow, but then to deviate according to your ingredients and your feelings, to understand that our ingredients and our hunger are variables that should not, cannot, be subjected to a set of formulas laid down in stone. I want to get you to break the rules. I want you to follow your appetite. You know what you like and what you don't. When shopping, you don't even bother to try some things on. Other things you dither over and reject. Other times you know, positively, instantly, instinctively, that something is right. Well, cooking can be just like that. A recipe is only telling you about someone else's taste. The writer is not allowing for your own. This is why I get exasperated with the more pedantic branch of the cookery-writing world that insists, 'This is the ultimate recipe, and this is how it must be done, otherwise it is just not right.' What they mean is that they have done this recipe over and over again and they think it is delicious and want you to try it, too. Fair enough. But to assume that their word is law is ridiculous - not to say downright arrogant. Don't be bullied by recipe writers. Listen to what they have to say - they know the pitfalls and also the fun to be had cooking - but trust your own taste, too. If you like the taste of a recipe as it is and the next line says, 'Add 300ml more cream', don't be bullied into adding the extra cream. Taste continually as you cook, and trust that taste. The crux of the matter is that it may be their recipe, but it is your supper. I have never believed in the foolproof recipe. It simply doesn't exist. No recipe can take into account what I call 'the variables'. How can any recipe tell you to cook a piece of fish for four minutes, then turn it over and cook the other side for two minutes longer? How does the recipe writer know how thick your pan is, the pressure of your gas, your version of moderate or high or simmer or stir? How do they know the accuracy of every oven, the thickness of your every cake tin, the nuances of every pot, pan and cooker? More importantly, how can that recipe assume to know the exact nature of your piece of fish? Telepathy? The fact is that food varies, and that is what makes it so interesting. Today's piece of cod may be slightly thicker than yesterday's. One brand of butter may differ from another. Olive oil changes with every bottle; that is part of its joy. So how can anyone be so pedantic as to give exact timings? Each egg, each steak, each potato is different and will behave in a different way in the pan. That is what cooking is about, and that is why it is essential to understand what you are doing rather than just mindlessly following a recipe. While some people like the 'certainty' that comes from following an exact recipe, others rarely bother with them. How many times do you hear someone say, 'I just throw it all together and it always seems to work out fine'? This does not always mean that they are experienced cooks - it may be more that they have an instinct for what might go with what. They may also have read or heard that x is good with y, or vaguely recall something they once ate. Whatever sort of cook you are there is nothing quite so rewarding as following your instincts and finding they pay off. There is a branch of cookery I called Cluttered Cooking. By this I mean recipes that are so choc-a-bloc full of ingredients and seasoning that the main ingredient itself has been lost. I find a lot of so-called fusion food suffers from this, as does some classical French cookery. I prefer the marriage of a few, intelligently chosen ingredients rather than a mishmash of everything in the cupboard. All the recipes in this book are a result of the pared-down approach. When people say they must follow a recipe, I often wonder if it is because they have not grasped the idea of less is more - the approach where just one or two ingredients are added to fish or meat or a vegetable to which they are perfectly suited. Whereas I would never wish to undermine the harmonious mixture of spices that work to flavour a curry sauce, say, I think we need to ask why we are adding something. What will it add and, frankly, what is its point? Anybody who doubts me need only roast a dish of slightly tart, green-speckled tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt, whole garlic and black pepper, then compare it with one to which they have added aubergines, peppers, onions, courgettes, tomato sauce and oregano. One taste of the pared-down, uncluttered flavour of a roast tomato, its sweet-sharp, thin juices clean and unadulterated, and you will wonder why anyone would ever even consider making ratatouille. A fishcake to console There is something peaceful and faintly reassuring about a fishcake. Old-fashioned food that reminds us of less frantic times. It is not for the sake of convenience that fishcakes are made with equal amounts of potato to fish. It is simply that the ratio seems right: not enough potato and the cakes lack substance, too much and they lack flavour. As alway s, it is up to us to nudge the two to make the recipe our own. Enough for 4-6. 500g potatoes 500g salmon, haddock, cod, hake or any large-flaked white fish milk for baking the fish in a little flour for coating butter and oil for frying a large glass of white wine, not too dry a small bunch of tarragon 1 medium carton (about 300ml) cream Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Peel the potatoes and cut them into large chunks, then boil them to tenderness in salted water. Meanwhile, put the fish into a baking dish, almost cover with milk - you can add a bay leaf or two if you like - then bake until the fish is opaque and will come easily from the bone or skin when you pull it. You can expect this to take about 10 to 15 minutes, bearing in mind that different types of fish take slightly different times to cook. Drain the potatoes, putting them back into the empty pan over a moderate heat for a few minutes if they seem wet, then mash them with a potato masher. Lift the fish from its milk, reserving the liquid, then pull the flakes away from the bones and skin. Tip the fish into the mashed potato, add salt and grind over some black pepper - if you wish to add any of the additional seasonings below, do so now - and mix briefly and gently, so as not to crush the flakes of fish too much. Shape the mixture into patties, as large or small as you like (I favour ones the size of a digestive biscuit and the thickness of an English muffin), coating each one lightly in flour as you go. I think you should avoid the temptation to err towards perfection. Wobbly cooking has a certain charm about it. Melt a little butter and oil in a frying pan (you need enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and fry your cakes till they are softly golden. This should take no more than a couple of minutes on each side. Keep them hot in a low oven. Wipe the pan out with kitchen paper, add the glass of wine and let it bubble down over a high heat until there are just a few tablespoons left; strip the tarragon leaves from their stems and drop them into the wine as it bubbles. Pour in the cream and a wine glassful of the fish milk and bring to the boil, turning it down to a fierce simmer so it thickens somewhat. Season with salt and pepper, then pour it over the fishcakes. And more... Some good things to add to your fishcakes Chopped, vivid-green parsley leaves; 5 or 6 mashed anchovies; a few shakes of anchovy sauce; chopped tarragon leaves; chopped dill; chopped leeks cooked in butter till soft. A chilli-hot, citrus-scented fishcake Forget the potatoes. Skin the fish (500g will be enough for 4 people). Blitz 2 spring onions, 2 cloves of garlic, a couple of small, seeded red chillies and 6 lime leaves together with a handful of coriander leaves in a food processor to make a thick sludge. Mix in 1 tbsp of nam pla (Thai fish sauce) and tip it into a bowl. Whiz the fish to a coarse paste, then mix it with the seasonings and shape into small cakes. Some flour on your hands will be useful here. Fry till golden brown. A smoked fishcake The smoky flavour of cured haddock, Arbroath smokies or even smoked salmon makes a beautiful, rather homely tasting fishcake, reminiscent of Victorian high tea. It is flattered enormously by a cream and parsley sauce (simply substitute parsley for the tarragon above, then whiz the sauce in a blender). Cured haddock and smokies will need cooking in milk, as above. Smoked trout or salmon can be added directly to the potato. Tinned-fish fishcakes Lovely. Canned salmon and sardines make deeply flavoured fishcakes. You will need the same quantity as fresh fish, and you will have to drain them of their oil or water. Squeeze wedges of lemon over. Little prawn cakes Make these in the same way as the chilli-hot cakes above but using defrosted cooked prawns. I sometimes add a dollop of mayonnaise and a little flour - the mayonnaise adding lusciousness, the flour holding the fragile little cakes in one piece. Chicken, garlic, herbs - a simple supper If we are to eat well, we need to know how to exploit every bit of flavour in our food. The idea that follows does exactly that. Meat is cooked slowly on the bone over a low to moderate heat so that, as it tenderises, it leaves a thin film of goo - the caramelised meat juices - with which we can make a sauce (when I say sauce, I mean something quite thin and meagre in quantity, but intensely flavoured rather than a copious creamy blanket). There is something neat about this recipe, and I am not talking about its frugal use of kitchen equipment, though that is another point in its favour. The shopping list, as always, is short. The method is straightforward, undemanding. Spinach or courgettes, briefly boiled and tossed with butter and lemon juice, and some French bread for mopping your plate might be good here. Enough for 4. free-range chicken - either a small bird, jointed by the butcher, or 2 chicken pieces per person, skin and bones to remain in place olive oil a thick slice of butter 6 large, sweet cloves of garlic a small bunch of parsley, plus tarragon, thyme or chervil a large wine glass of white wine or dry vermouth Rub the chicken all over with a little oil and some black pepper. In a large pan - it can be high-sided or shallow but it must have a lid - warm enough olive oil to give a small puddle in the bottom, then add the butter. Once the butter starts to froth, put in the chicken pieces and keep the heat moderately high while they colour. A pale and relatively even gold is what you are after. Meanwhile, put the whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a board and, with the flat blade of a knife, squash them so they flatten but remain fairly intact. Throw them in with the chicken. Turn down the heat so the fat under the chicken is gently fizzing, then add a little sea salt, cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat. The time it takes to cook will depend on the thickness of your chicken joints, but expect them to need about 40 minutes. You will have to turn them during cooking so they colour on all sides. Meanwhile, pluck the leaves from the herbs and chop them roughly. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish or warm plates, then fish out the garlic (although the garlic has done its work, it may be tender and sweet and is worth adding to the plate, though the skin should be discarded at some point). Tip off most of the fat from the pan - what you are after is the golden, caramelised juice stuck to the bottom - then turn up the heat, pour in the wine and add the herbs and let it bubble. Scrape away at any stuck bits in the pan, encouraging them to dissolve into the wine with a wooden spoon. Let this all bubble away for a minute or two until you have a thin liquor. It should be pale and interesting. Now taste the juice for seasoning - it may need salt, pepper or a squeeze of lemon juice - and spoon it over the chicken. And more... A buttery finish Once the wine has bubbled down, whisk in a thick slice of butter (about 50g), cut into tiny cubes. Taste and spoon over the chicken. Or a creamy one Once you have removed the chicken from the pan and poured in your wine or vermouth, let it bubble away until you have only half of it left, then add about half as much cream. As it continues to bubble, stir in chopped parsley and slightly less chopped tarragon. Finish with salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. Lamb with garlic and lemon What works for a chicken thigh will also work for a lamb chop. Try the original idea but with chump chops and adding parsley and mint. Finish with the squeeze of a lemon. Pork chops with apple and cream Rib chops, with their generous marbling of integral fat (rather than a loin chop with its great wodge of fat running alongside the lean meat), are delectable cooked this way. You should let them colour well before turning down the heat, adding an apple or two, peeled and cut into small cubes, and letting it colour with the pork. When it is time to take out the meat, leave the apple be, then add the wine and let it simmer down a bit before pouring in a small pot of double cream. Stir, taking the sediment from the pan with you and dissolving it into the cream with your wooden spoon. Herbs are not really needed here, though the garlic is. I once crushed a few juniper berries, adding them after the meat and fruit had browned, to great effect. A no-fuss puff-pastry vegetable pie I have never understood why some people come over all sniffy about ready-made puff pastry. It is a perfectly good commercial product - light, crisp and a joy for people like me who imagine they have better things to do than make their own. (Shortcrust is different altogether because they never put enough butter in the commercial stuff and anyway, it's as easy as toast to make.) You can buy prepared puff pastry chilled or frozen and now made with butter instead of vegetable fat. But the best invention must be puff pastry that is ready rolled and cut to size. The sort that comes in a long, thin rectangle is the most useful of all - it can become a pie or a millefeuille in the time it takes you to find the rolling pin, though you might like to roll it just a tiny bit thinner, so it becomes even lighter and crisper. Enough for 4. 5 medium-sized onions enough butter or oil to cover the bottom of a medium-sized shallow pan 350g of any firm variety of mushrooms, or a mixture chopped thyme, lemon thyme or oregano (just enough to sit in the palm of your hand) about 200g cr\u00e8me frache 425g puff pastry a little beaten egg or milk to glaze the pastry Peel and roughly chop the onions and let them cook slowly with the butter or oil over a low heat for 20 minutes or so, until they are golden, soft and almost transparent. Tear or slice the mushrooms into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to the onions, adding a little more butter or oil if they soak it all up. Leave them to turn golden and tender but stir them from time to time so they do not stick and burn. Season them with the chopped herbs and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache, grinding in a little salt and pepper as you go. You want a mixture that is creamy rather than runny, so let it bubble for a minute or two to thicken. Heat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. The pastry needs to be rolled into two rectangles about 35cm by 20cm (conveniently the same measurements as the ready-rolled frozen stuff). Lay one piece on a lightly floured baking sheet and spread the mushrooms and onions over, leaving a good finger-thickness of bare rim around the edge. Brush a little beaten egg, milk or even water around the rim, lay the second rectangle of pastry over the top and squeeze the rims together to seal. It is worth being zealous about pinching the pastry - there shouldn't be any possibility of the filling escaping. Brush with more of the beaten egg or milk so the pastry will take on a rich golden shine in the oven, then cut a few little holes in the top to let out the steam. Bake the pie until it has puffed up like a cushion and is the colour of honey. This should take about 25 minutes. It is worth sneaking a look at the bottom to check if the pastry is crisp underneath (it should be fine, because this is not an especially wet filling). And more... Some other good things There is magic, at least there is for me, in the bringing together of mushrooms, cream and puff pastry, but there are other fillings you can try here, too. A Gorgonzola and broccoli pie If broccoli ever seems just that bit too 'good for you', you can always take the smugness off its face by mixing it with cream and cheese. It works well in a pie like this in place of mushrooms. Cook the florets briefly, drain them, then fold them in with the onions and cr\u00e8me frache above. As we're lacking the savoury note of the mushrooms, I suggest some cheese - a blue, perhaps, such as a creamy Gorgonzola, a little Roquefort or Cashel Blue from Ireland. Garlic, cream and potato pie If you have any leftover pommes dauphinoise, I suggest you add a few softened onions and stuff it all between two sheets of pastry as in the pie above. I know potatoes in pastry sounds like a carbohydrate overdose but the effect is softened by the garlic-scented cream and buttery onions. Pushing your fork through golden, flaking pastry and slices of melting, cream-sodden potato is utter bliss. Pumpkin pie (but not that pumpkin pie) When I say pumpkin pie, I mean a savoury one with onions and cream, not the bland, over-rated tart that I have never managed to get the hots for. Peel a small pumpkin, cut it into chunks and roast with a generous amount of butter. When the golden flesh is soft and sweetly caramelised, add it to the softened onions above with the cr\u00e8me frache and a very little ground cinnamon. Pile it on to the pastry and top as usual. Great as a side dish for sausages. A thin, crisp fruit tart There are, I would venture, few more tempting sights than a baking tray of crisp, flaky fruit tarts fresh out of the oven. If you make your own pastry (and why not, if you have the time and the patience?), they will be sublime, but even with shop-bought puff pastry they are pretty fine. The trick is to roll the pastry as thin as you dare and bake them in a very hot oven. To get them at their most pleasurable, eat them warm, with cream or vanilla ice cream, so you get a mouthful of crisp, hot pastry, luscious fruit and cold ice cream all at once. Enough for 6. 340g pack of defrosted puff pastry or a 425g pack of ready rolled 4 fairly tart dessert apples a thick slice of butter, melted a little caster sugar Get the oven really hot. I set mine at 230 C/ gas mark 8. Roll the pastry out as thin as you can without actually being able to see through it. If the tarts are to be crisp and flaky, the pastry should be no thicker than a pound coin. If you have bought ready-rolled puff pastry, then roll it out just a little more. Using a large saucer or small side plate as a template, cut out six discs of pastry. Using something smaller (a cup, say), score a slightly smaller circle within each one so you have a small rim. This will rise and hold in the apples. Slide the pieces of pastry on to a baking sheet, then prick the centre circles of pastry all over with a fork, which will stop them puffing up too much in the oven and throwing the apples off. Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and carve out their cores, then slice them thinly. Arrange the slices on the pastry discs (I like to do this in rather formal, overlapping circles). Brush the apples and pastry with melted butter, then dust them with a fine layer of sugar - anything more generous would make the tarts too sweet. Bake them until the pastry is golden and is fully crisp underneath, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before eating. And more... Leftover pastry Parsimonious cooks will no doubt want to use the scraps of leftover pastry. My suggestion is to brush them with melted butter and dust them with grated Parmesan, then bake as above and eat while still hot and crisp. Frankly, I don't bother. We are only talking about a few scraps of pastry. A large apple tart There is something rather territorial about having your own fruit tart. If you prefer one large one to put on the table and cut up between your friends, then use one sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry, score a thin border around the edge, prick the centre and lay overlapping slices of apple, as thin as you can cut them, all over. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar and bake as above. A cheese and apple tart When you have brushed the tarts above with the butter, scatter a fine layer of finely grated Parmesan over them and bake as above. Neither a starter nor a pudding, this. More of a snack, really. Pear tarts Pears can produce the finest tarts of all, possessing a lusciousness that apples lack. The trick is to cook the fruit slightly beforehand so its flesh is soft and juicy. This is easy. Make up enough sugar syrup to cover the peeled, halved and cored pears (just put the pears in a pan, cover them with water and tip in a cupful of sugar), then simmer till they are tender to the point of a knife. Lift them out, drain them briefly, then slice thinly and overlap the slices on the pastry. Brush them with some of the sugar syrup, then bake as above. A banana tart Cut out and prick the tarts as above. Cut six bananas into slices as thick as pound coins, then divide them between the pastries. Brush them, and the pastry edges, with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. After 10 minutes or so in the oven, brush the tarts with melted apricot jam, then return them to the oven for a few minutes more. Eat hot, offering everyone the cream jug or a ball of vanilla ice. Apricot tarts Crisp pastry and juicy fruit. Use tinned apricots, or halve, stone and poach some fresh ones in a little sugar and water. Drain them well, then lay them on the pastry, cut side up, and bake till the edges are just caught and the pastry crisp. Since they are so heavy with juice, you may find you need neither ice cream nor cream. They are rich enough as it is. Visit www.nigelslater.co.uk - recipes are updated daily.",

      "body": "<p>'What about some maples then?'</p> <p>'No, can't stand them.'</p> <p>'Oh, all right then.'</p> <p>Nothing, you see, is planted in this garden without exhaustive debate. No stone is left unturned when considering the relative merits of every potential plant. Not. It is a visceral thing. Some plants you like and some just don't do it. Prejudice rules and everything runs along nicely until one day you are surprised by something, love it, check it out and remember that you hate it. </p> <p>This used to confuse me but now I rather like having these fixed views overturned. At this rate, by the time I am creeping round the garden on my Zimmer frame it will be filled with rhododendrons, heathers, dwarf conifers, maples, begonias, bergenias and yuccas - but not yet, oh Lord, not yet.</p> <p>Actually, I do have maples, lots of them, but they are all the same type, Acer campestre , the field maple. There are an awful lot of different kinds of maple, but only one British one and this is it. In its own way it is as good as any. The late, great but wildly opinionated dendrologist Alan Mitchell described it as 'depressingly moderate in all departments'. I disagree with him about this, as I do with most of his aesthetic judgments about trees. We have half a dozen growing as trees and hundreds of others making a hedge. It does both tricks with great ease and elegance. By the time you are reading this it will have developed its fabulous golden autumn colour - not as lauded as its flashier transatlantic cousins, but pretty good and certainly the best in our garden.</p> <p>It seems to me that this is an undervalued indigenous garden plant and, rather like hawthorn, is still mainly considered as a 'wild' tree of the agricultural hedgerow. But it is a waste to leave it out of the garden. It holds its shape very well as a hedge, coming into leaf early and losing them late, grows fast and very sturdy, but only needs trimming once a year to look good. It also makes a good small tree which will take any amount of shaping. There are a few 'garden' varieties, none of which I have grown or seen, but they sound promising. A c 'Postelense' probably sounds the best. It has yellow leaves when young, turning greener as the summer progresses. A campestre 'Schwerinii' is a purple- leafed version.</p> <p>The other maple that most town gardener's are all-too-familiar with is A pseudoplatanus or the sycamore. This is a weed in a small town garden, shading out everything beneath it and producing seedlings by the thousand. But in open country, near the sea or on the edge of a wood it can be a magnificent tree, hunkering down against foul weather with the same muscular indifference that it tolerates urban pollution. I cannot think of a good reason to plant one, but if you have a good specimen foisted on you then enjoy it, especially its new leaves in spring. There are a number of varieties of sycamore. A pseudoplatanus 'Atropurpureum' has interesting leaves that are green above and purple below (the opposite of the copper beech). A pseudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' never reaches anything like the size of the parent plant but does develop leaves that start out shrimp pink before becoming green via a yellowy phase.</p> <p>I have grown a Norway maple and they are like a more refined, less invasive sycamore. It was certainly beautiful in autumn, turning lemon yellow before sometimes blushing red.</p> <p>A platanoides is not so different from a sycamore, but more refined and apparently less able to cope with salt spray. Its refinement has been induced to a wide range of garden flavours by breeding, ranging from the diminutive 'Nanum' or 'Globosum' to the upright 'Columnare' and the purple (or almost chocolate) 'Goldsworth Purple'. I like my Norway maple species-straight.</p> <p>That is pretty much it for the European maples, but I appreciate that none of these are what most people think of when you conjoin 'garden' and 'maple'. I suspect that A palmatum is the maple that most people reach for when they want a shrubby tree to decorate a small garden. It is highly decorative with its low mounds of finely cut leaves glowing with autumn colour. I have not yet worked out why I do not like them. I did try growing A palmatum ' Dissectum Atropurpureum' and for about five years it sulked, obstinately refusing to grow or gracefully die.</p> <p>There are only two considerations to take into account when buying a Japanese maple - the colour and the shape of the leaves. The colour ranges from red through bronze and all the usual shades of green, and the leaf shapes include the remarkably fine, deeply cut leaves of the dissectum group and the Japanese maples with bigger, more recognisably maple leaves. Actually there is also another, completely different leaf shape only found on A carpinifolium , and the name gives away its similarity to the hornbeam. But like all maples, it has the familiar helicopter seeds.</p> <p>My favourite Eastern maple is A griseum , the paperbark maple from China. The leaves dutifully do their maple bit in autumn, turning rich scarlet, but the bark adds a spectacular sideshow, peeling and flaking to reveal a cinnamon-coloured underlayer. I would love to grow one here.</p> <p>The third group of maples comes from America. At their autumnal best the maples of the East coast are staggering. Whereas the Japanese maples are all small, with the largest reaching no more than 50ft, many of the American maples make magnificent 100ft-plus trees. We inherited a sugar maple, A saccharum (not to be confused with the similarly named silver maple, A saccharinum ) in our last garden, but it only blushed apologetically instead of the expected explosion into crimson.

It is tough and will grow almost anywhere, but is very dull. However, A negundo 'Auratum' is an intense yellow all summer, fading to green in autumn.

One of the reasons for being a little behind in all this is because the mist-propagator has been out of action for a few weeks - one of the cables was shorting and blowing all the fuses in the house - so I have been trying to cram it with plants to make up for lost time and get things to root before we run out of light. In a week or two I am going to have the whole thing dismantled and moved to another bit of the greenhouse. </p> <p>I have found that all chicories will endure pretty much any amount of cold, but the combination of winter wet rots them.

Also, the number of tulips in the ground severely limits plant upheaval once they start to appear. So between now and Christmas is the best time to clear the decks.

I plant two or three separate lots between the end of October and Christmas. Push the cloves in plenty deep - at least 1 inch below the surface. </p> <p>Even if you are silly enough not to collect and use all your fallen leaves, do clear all leaves from rock gardens, ponds and the crowns of herbaceous plants, otherwise they can form a soggy matt which will rot plants and kill fish.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'What about some maples then?' 'No, can't stand them.' 'Oh, all right then.' Nothing, you see, is planted in this garden without exhaustive debate. No stone is left unturned when considering the relative merits of every potential plant. Not. It is a visceral thing. Some plants you like and some just don't do it. Prejudice rules and everything runs along nicely until one day you are surprised by something, love it, check it out and remember that you hate it. This used to confuse me but now I rather like having these fixed views overturned. At this rate, by the time I am creeping round the garden on my Zimmer frame it will be filled with rhododendrons, heathers, dwarf conifers, maples, begonias, bergenias and yuccas - but not yet, oh Lord, not yet. Actually, I do have maples, lots of them, but they are all the same type, Acer campestre , the field maple. There are an awful lot of different kinds of maple, but only one British one and this is it. In its own way it is as good as any. The late, great but wildly opinionated dendrologist Alan Mitchell described it as 'depressingly moderate in all departments'. I disagree with him about this, as I do with most of his aesthetic judgments about trees. We have half a dozen growing as trees and hundreds of others making a hedge. It does both tricks with great ease and elegance. By the time you are reading this it will have developed its fabulous golden autumn colour - not as lauded as its flashier transatlantic cousins, but pretty good and certainly the best in our garden. It seems to me that this is an undervalued indigenous garden plant and, rather like hawthorn, is still mainly considered as a 'wild' tree of the agricultural hedgerow. But it is a waste to leave it out of the garden. It holds its shape very well as a hedge, coming into leaf early and losing them late, grows fast and very sturdy, but only needs trimming once a year to look good. It also makes a good small tree which will take any amount of shaping. There are a few 'garden' varieties, none of which I have grown or seen, but they sound promising. A c 'Postelense' probably sounds the best. It has yellow leaves when young, turning greener as the summer progresses. A campestre 'Schwerinii' is a purple- leafed version. The other maple that most town gardener's are all-too-familiar with is A pseudoplatanus or the sycamore. This is a weed in a small town garden, shading out everything beneath it and producing seedlings by the thousand. But in open country, near the sea or on the edge of a wood it can be a magnificent tree, hunkering down against foul weather with the same muscular indifference that it tolerates urban pollution. I cannot think of a good reason to plant one, but if you have a good specimen foisted on you then enjoy it, especially its new leaves in spring. There are a number of varieties of sycamore. A pseudoplatanus 'Atropurpureum' has interesting leaves that are green above and purple below (the opposite of the copper beech). A pseudoplatanus 'Brilliantissimum' never reaches anything like the size of the parent plant but does develop leaves that start out shrimp pink before becoming green via a yellowy phase. I have grown a Norway maple and they are like a more refined, less invasive sycamore. It was certainly beautiful in autumn, turning lemon yellow before sometimes blushing red. A platanoides is not so different from a sycamore, but more refined and apparently less able to cope with salt spray. Its refinement has been induced to a wide range of garden flavours by breeding, ranging from the diminutive 'Nanum' or 'Globosum' to the upright 'Columnare' and the purple (or almost chocolate) 'Goldsworth Purple'. I like my Norway maple species-straight. That is pretty much it for the European maples, but I appreciate that none of these are what most people think of when you conjoin 'garden' and 'maple'. I suspect that A palmatum is the maple that most people reach for when they want a shrubby tree to decorate a small garden. It is highly decorative with its low mounds of finely cut leaves glowing with autumn colour. I have not yet worked out why I do not like them. I did try growing A palmatum ' Dissectum Atropurpureum' and for about five years it sulked, obstinately refusing to grow or gracefully die. There are only two considerations to take into account when buying a Japanese maple - the colour and the shape of the leaves. The colour ranges from red through bronze and all the usual shades of green, and the leaf shapes include the remarkably fine, deeply cut leaves of the dissectum group and the Japanese maples with bigger, more recognisably maple leaves. Actually there is also another, completely different leaf shape only found on A carpinifolium , and the name gives away its similarity to the hornbeam. But like all maples, it has the familiar helicopter seeds. My favourite Eastern maple is A griseum , the paperbark maple from China. The leaves dutifully do their maple bit in autumn, turning rich scarlet, but the bark adds a spectacular sideshow, peeling and flaking to reveal a cinnamon-coloured underlayer. I would love to grow one here. The third group of maples comes from America. At their autumnal best the maples of the East coast are staggering. Whereas the Japanese maples are all small, with the largest reaching no more than 50ft, many of the American maples make magnificent 100ft-plus trees. We inherited a sugar maple, A saccharum (not to be confused with the similarly named silver maple, A saccharinum ) in our last garden, but it only blushed apologetically instead of the expected explosion into crimson. The truth is that it is a very rare year that we can provide the combination of very hot August days and very cool nights that they need to produce that foliar orgasm. A rubrum , by the way, will not colour well if it grows on chalk, regardless of temperatures, but give it acidic soil and it is one of the first to turn a brilliant crimson. Finally, the best American maple for a small garden is a form of A negundo , known as the box elder (nothing to do with either box or elder). The basic A negundo is a common wild tree in the States, identifiable by the way the leaves appear as three separate short-stalked entities. It is tough and will grow almost anywhere, but is very dull. However, A negundo 'Auratum' is an intense yellow all summer, fading to green in autumn. A negundo 'Variegatum' is fringed dramatically with white variegation and A negundo var. violaceum has lilac shoots covered with a powdery bloom in winter. Sounds wonderful. My roots: a week in Monty's garden I took my penstemon and salvia cuttings at the beginning of this month, which is a little later than usual. On the whole this has worked out fine for the penstemons, which are terribly willing to strike at almost any time, but caused a difficulty with Salvia guaranitica that I had not come across before.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When his more liberal-minded friends tax Tony Blair for grovelling to right-wing newspapers, the Prime Minister answers the charge of appeasement with a pained frown that begs for understanding and offers this plea in mitigation. 'I haven't given them what they really want,' Blair has been heard to say of the Sun, Daily Mail, the Times and Telegraph. 'I haven't ruled out the euro.' </p> <p>Not yet he hasn't. But for how much longer will he resist the siren voices urging the Prime Minister to give the Europhobes what they really want? To declare against membership of the single currency is the one act that would be most certain to secure extension of his Faustian bargain with crucial segments of the right-wing press. And since he invests, however misguidedly, so much importance in that constituency, the Prime Minister would also regard it as the one act most guaranteed to secure a solid majority for his second term. </p> <p>The price - and this is why he has so far resisted the temptation - would be the final and comprehensive ruination of his strategy towards Europe. No longer would the Prime Minister be able to look Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in the eye as he tells them of his long-term intent to make Britain a good European. Not unless he enjoys being laughed at in French and German. I'm told that Wim Kok, the Prime Minister of Holland and one of his closer friends on the Continent, is bored stiff listening to Mr Blair's private excuses that he would be in the single currency already were it not for Britain's phobic media. To rule out membership of the euro would consign Mr Blair to the dismal fate that he pledged would never happen when he said that 'under my leadership' Britain would 'never be isolated or left behind in Europe'. </p> <p>But then, he is already becoming isolated and left behind, having conceded to the French and German desire to create a fast-track European \u00e9lite based on the members of the euro-zone. In the capitals of the Continent, they begin to talk of him as yet another British Prime Minister who promised so much only to prove to be an inconstant, semi-detached, second-division partner. That disillusion will be reinforced by the Prime Minister's remarks uttered 'in the margins' - as it is appropriately reported - of the Euro-Asia summit in Seoul. 'If you came along to me with an opinion poll and said, \"Do you want to join the euro today?\", I would say no.' </p> <p>Had Tony Blair previously behaved less like a respondent to an opinion poll and performed more like a leader, he might not be so horribly impaled on his European dilemma. He is now further away than ever from the day that Britain ends its self-imposed exile from the heart of Europe, more remote from fulfilment of his self-perceived destiny of being a leader in Europe. The prospects of joining the euro early in the next parliament - still, in theory, the Prime Minister's policy - shrivel by the week. </p> <p>The five economic tests are balls, in the sense that they were schemed up by Ed Balls, the Chancellor's sceptical guide on the single currency, and also in the sense that they are bollocks. The real tests are the political hurdles and these look ever more unscalable. </p> <p>1: Is there sustainable convergence between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? No: Gordon Brown's opposition to the euro is hardening, fired by his pride in his own economic framework and animated by his ambition to replace Tony Blair. There are quite a lot of sleeping Eurosceptics in the Cabinet, among them John Prescott, who makes it clear that he would insist on a Cabinet debate and - even more unheard of in this government - a vote around the table. </p> <p>2: Can the press be cured of its anti-European rabies? Ha! What Neil Kinnock calls the 'toxic' press will fight with a ferociousness that will make its treatment of Mr Kinnock when he was Labour leader seem gentle and generous. The forces of phobia in the press may gain another recruit if the Express group falls into the wrong hands. </p> <p>3: Is public opinion warming towards the euro? The reverse is the case. There is more antagonism towards the single currency, and more hostility towards Europe as a whole, than there was when New Labour came to office. </p> <p>4: Can a referendum be won? It is hard to quarrel with Bob Worcester, that veteran reader of the entrails of public opinion, that it now looks 'absolutely impossible' for the Government to convince Britain to embrace the single currency. </p> <p>5: In what circumstances would Tony Blair gamble his credibility as Prime Minister by taking on the right-wing press to call a referendum that all the pollsters tell him he would lose? None imaginable; Ian Paisley converting to Catholicism is more conceivable. </p> <p>As it becomes progressively less likely that Tony Blair will be able to take Britain into the single currency in the next parliament, so you begin to hear influential voices suggesting that he should make a virtue of necessity and rule it out. His Press Secretary, Alastair Campbell, is a gut euro-sceptic. The focus-group guru, Philip Gould, fears few things more than New Labour being out-flanked by the Tories on 'patriotic' issues. Robin Cook would resist the shift with all his might, but the Foreign Secretary's might is rather light, and his tenure at King Charles Street is not likely to be extended beyond the election. </p> <p>The Government's slide in a more sceptic direction has caused clouds of gloom to descend upon Peter Mandelson, who is, to his credit, the Cabinet's most consistent and most articulate pro-European, even when constantly menaced by assault from the Euro-hating press and battery by the Chancellor's bovver boys. </p> <p>Mandelson would fight ruling out the euro - but to the death? If the choice was between keeping open a diminishing euro option and being sure of re-election, Peter Mandelson would choose the latter. He it was who chose as Labour's last campaign mascot a bulldog, symbol not only of the phobic Right but of the skinhead Right. </p> <p>Rejecting the single currency for the next parliament is the one position possessed by William Hague which chimes with the views of the majority. It is planned by the Conservatives as a sharp weapon of their election campaigning. Should New Labour declare that it will not attempt to enter the euro in the next parliament, the Tory leader will have bags of fun crowing over a monumental U-turn and mocking the reverse as a severe humiliation for the Prime Minister. Though he would be right about that, Hague would weep many private tears. If the Labour and Tory approaches to the single currency become indistinguishable, Mr Hague will be left cradling a dead fox. His one popular posture will have been shot. His 'Save The \u00a3' van will be garaged for the indefinite future. He would then come under intense pressure from within his own party to harden the Tory position into a never to the single currency.

      "bodyText": "When his more liberal-minded friends tax Tony Blair for grovelling to right-wing newspapers, the Prime Minister answers the charge of appeasement with a pained frown that begs for understanding and offers this plea in mitigation. 'I haven't given them what they really want,' Blair has been heard to say of the Sun, Daily Mail, the Times and Telegraph. 'I haven't ruled out the euro.' Not yet he hasn't. But for how much longer will he resist the siren voices urging the Prime Minister to give the Europhobes what they really want? To declare against membership of the single currency is the one act that would be most certain to secure extension of his Faustian bargain with crucial segments of the right-wing press. And since he invests, however misguidedly, so much importance in that constituency, the Prime Minister would also regard it as the one act most guaranteed to secure a solid majority for his second term. The price - and this is why he has so far resisted the temptation - would be the final and comprehensive ruination of his strategy towards Europe. No longer would the Prime Minister be able to look Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in the eye as he tells them of his long-term intent to make Britain a good European. Not unless he enjoys being laughed at in French and German. I'm told that Wim Kok, the Prime Minister of Holland and one of his closer friends on the Continent, is bored stiff listening to Mr Blair's private excuses that he would be in the single currency already were it not for Britain's phobic media. To rule out membership of the euro would consign Mr Blair to the dismal fate that he pledged would never happen when he said that 'under my leadership' Britain would 'never be isolated or left behind in Europe'. But then, he is already becoming isolated and left behind, having conceded to the French and German desire to create a fast-track European \u00e9lite based on the members of the euro-zone. In the capitals of the Continent, they begin to talk of him as yet another British Prime Minister who promised so much only to prove to be an inconstant, semi-detached, second-division partner. That disillusion will be reinforced by the Prime Minister's remarks uttered 'in the margins' - as it is appropriately reported - of the Euro-Asia summit in Seoul. 'If you came along to me with an opinion poll and said, \"Do you want to join the euro today?\", I would say no.' Had Tony Blair previously behaved less like a respondent to an opinion poll and performed more like a leader, he might not be so horribly impaled on his European dilemma. He is now further away than ever from the day that Britain ends its self-imposed exile from the heart of Europe, more remote from fulfilment of his self-perceived destiny of being a leader in Europe. The prospects of joining the euro early in the next parliament - still, in theory, the Prime Minister's policy - shrivel by the week. The five economic tests are balls, in the sense that they were schemed up by Ed Balls, the Chancellor's sceptical guide on the single currency, and also in the sense that they are bollocks. The real tests are the political hurdles and these look ever more unscalable. 1: Is there sustainable convergence between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor? No: Gordon Brown's opposition to the euro is hardening, fired by his pride in his own economic framework and animated by his ambition to replace Tony Blair. There are quite a lot of sleeping Eurosceptics in the Cabinet, among them John Prescott, who makes it clear that he would insist on a Cabinet debate and - even more unheard of in this government - a vote around the table. 2: Can the press be cured of its anti-European rabies? Ha! What Neil Kinnock calls the 'toxic' press will fight with a ferociousness that will make its treatment of Mr Kinnock when he was Labour leader seem gentle and generous. The forces of phobia in the press may gain another recruit if the Express group falls into the wrong hands. 3: Is public opinion warming towards the euro? The reverse is the case. There is more antagonism towards the single currency, and more hostility towards Europe as a whole, than there was when New Labour came to office. 4: Can a referendum be won? It is hard to quarrel with Bob Worcester, that veteran reader of the entrails of public opinion, that it now looks 'absolutely impossible' for the Government to convince Britain to embrace the single currency. 5: In what circumstances would Tony Blair gamble his credibility as Prime Minister by taking on the right-wing press to call a referendum that all the pollsters tell him he would lose? None imaginable; Ian Paisley converting to Catholicism is more conceivable. As it becomes progressively less likely that Tony Blair will be able to take Britain into the single currency in the next parliament, so you begin to hear influential voices suggesting that he should make a virtue of necessity and rule it out. His Press Secretary, Alastair Campbell, is a gut euro-sceptic. The focus-group guru, Philip Gould, fears few things more than New Labour being out-flanked by the Tories on 'patriotic' issues. Robin Cook would resist the shift with all his might, but the Foreign Secretary's might is rather light, and his tenure at King Charles Street is not likely to be extended beyond the election. The Government's slide in a more sceptic direction has caused clouds of gloom to descend upon Peter Mandelson, who is, to his credit, the Cabinet's most consistent and most articulate pro-European, even when constantly menaced by assault from the Euro-hating press and battery by the Chancellor's bovver boys. Mandelson would fight ruling out the euro - but to the death? If the choice was between keeping open a diminishing euro option and being sure of re-election, Peter Mandelson would choose the latter. He it was who chose as Labour's last campaign mascot a bulldog, symbol not only of the phobic Right but of the skinhead Right. Rejecting the single currency for the next parliament is the one position possessed by William Hague which chimes with the views of the majority. It is planned by the Conservatives as a sharp weapon of their election campaigning. Should New Labour declare that it will not attempt to enter the euro in the next parliament, the Tory leader will have bags of fun crowing over a monumental U-turn and mocking the reverse as a severe humiliation for the Prime Minister. Though he would be right about that, Hague would weep many private tears. If the Labour and Tory approaches to the single currency become indistinguishable, Mr Hague will be left cradling a dead fox. His one popular posture will have been shot. His 'Save The \u00a3' van will be garaged for the indefinite future. He would then come under intense pressure from within his own party to harden the Tory position into a never to the single currency. Thus will British political debate ratchet even further in a Europhobic direction. The best guess is that Tony Blair will resist making an absolutely unequivocal statement ruling out the single currency. He will not want to acknowledge openly the defeat of his entire approach to Europe. He will want to reassure himself, as well as foreign investors, that Britain will still join at some time. On past form, there will be a series of nudges, winks and nods to the wise that time of entry is retreating into the mists of the shrouded future. Number 10 will let it be known that the Prime Minister regards it as increasingly less probable that Britain will join in the next parliament. Journalists will be encouraged to interpret this as meaning the euro is effectively ruled out. As was the case when he first came to power, so it is now: the single currency has never mattered as much to Tony Blair as his second term.",

      "body": "<p>A few months ago I was on a news chat show with a reactionary pundit - Peter Hitchens, perhaps, or maybe Melanie Phillips, they all blur into one as I get older - and he or she was struck by the contrast between the decent British and the turbulent continentals. 'We remove our governments in free elections,' came the patriotic bellow. 'French presidents are brought down by mobs in the street.'</p> <p>The line has since become a favourite charge against the European Union in our patriotic, foreign-owned press. It is probably useless to point out that no recent French government has been overthrown by revolutionary crowds. (Even General de Gaulle survived the student uprising of 1968. He resigned a year later after a bathetic defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform.) The supposedly docile British are far more incendiary. Striking miners lost Edward Heath the 1974 election as surely as the Winter of Discontent destroyed Jim Callaghan's chances in 1979. Poll-tax rioters and the refusal of millions to pay the hated charge persuaded the Tory Party to dump Margaret Thatcher. If you believe that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and those on the Right who praise our passivity are quite adamant on this point, then you must admit that Britain has hosted a war which has taken 3,000 lives in the last 30 years and may not be over yet. No other Western European country has as many casualties of political violence.</p> <p>It is therefore conceivable that the fuel protesters will rip the guts out of the Government when their deadline runs out on 13 November. New Labour will have made concessions by then. But will a few pence off petrol tax or a cut in vehicle excise duty satisfy men drunk on the praise of William Hague and the Daily Mail ? Will they empty the roads again? Will a second blockade destroy Blair's reputation for competence? Will the gold Gordon Brown planned to stuff in the mouths of the electorate be wasted on deep cuts in fuel duty which will buy few votes if the oil cartel uses them as cover and raises its prices and profits? A wounded New Labour could stumble on like John Major's administration after the ERM disaster. Its nemesis would come on the day after the election when the voters awake to find William Hague in Downing Street, desperately hoping everyone has forgotten his promises to cut taxes and raise spending simultaneously.</p> <p>It could happen, but I suspect not. One of the pleasures of watching a culture which spends the national wealth of a medium-sized African country on probing public opinion is the joy of gloating at the failure of market researchers to second guess emotional surges. When Diana Spencer's car crashed, few predicted that millions would make fools of themselves by wailing for an aristocrat they had never met. The grieving process was embarrassingly brief. Moist newspaper supplements and TV specials were released to mark the first anniversary of the death 'that changed Britain for ever'. The readership and viewing figures were abysmal. Diana's mourners had dwindled into a small and rather sad cult.</p> <p>There are straws in the wind which suggest that the giddy roll from mass sympathy to indifference may hit the refinery protesters. Radio 5 Live is far better than any opinion poll at revealing the wisdom or alarming madness of your fellow citizens. During the blockade a large majority of callers were right behind direct action. The Fi Glover Show returned to the subject at the beginning of the month. David Handley, leader of Farmers for Action, the most militant group in the cheap-petrol lobby, was in the studio. He and everyone else was stunned by the near-unanimous abuse. 'You don't represent me.' 'You pocket my taxes.' 'I want to get to work/hospital/the children's day centre.' 'Who do you think you are?' 'Don't you dare do it again.' And the killer question: 'Why aren't you looking after your sheep?'</p> <p>The paradox of pro-car demonstrators stopping the motorists they claim to represent from using their cars cannot be hidden indefinitely. Last week the Government began its fightback and released hair-raising tales of intimidation of tanker drivers. More telling than the propaganda was a short statement from Chris Fox of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The indulgence officers granted hauliers and farmers, which amazed everyone who remembered the miners' strike, would be replaced by 'vigorous' policing, he said. This is a serious threat. As Lord Falconer and other New Labour lawyers have been whispering, Michael Howard and Jack Straw have ensured that the punishments for protest are now very vigorous indeed.</p> <p>It is not technically illegal to demonstrate in Britain. But if the police are out to get you, it can feel that way. Go on to oil refinery land and you can be arrested for aggravated trespass. Stand on the road outside, and charges for obstructing the highway can follow. Retire to the verge and prosecutors can use laws designed to stop misfits hounding celebs and arrest you for stalking. If you join a march of more than 20 people, you are legally obliged to do what the police tell you or face the consequences. If the oil companies get an injunction against you for restraining their trade, officers will act as their agents. The desire to turn protesters into criminals saturates the Home Office's Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Whitehall is modestly proposing that anyone who damages property, or merely discusses a plan to damage property, should be treated as a terrorist on a par with the Omagh bombers.</p> <p>These are the formal laws against robust dissent. An imaginative constabulary can deploy many others. Two weeks ago a man demonstrating against the digging of a quarry near the Neolithic Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire sat on a dry-stone wall. It collapsed. Helpful officers ran over to check he was all right and then arrested him for criminal damage.</p> <p>The most powerful doctrine of our time is that nation states are powerless in the global market place. It ignores the efforts of one powerful nation state - America - to override all resistance to free trade and deregulated markets and misses the dependence of corporations on compliant politicians. National leaders can still make life uncomfortable for executives in their borders. The rumour going around Whitehall is that Blair has warned the oil companies that he will hit them with a long and burdensome inquiry into their anti-competitive practices if they don't try a little harder to get the petrol tankers moving next time.</p> <p>I can't see the future and don't know if the bickering petrol protesters will give us a next time. If they do, they may learn what trade unionists and greens have known for years. The ancient rights of the British to protest are as much a part of a flattering national myth as the notion that mobs only bring down Ministries in a sinister place called Abroad.</p> <p>Like the Child Support Agency before it, the National Criminal Records Agency is plodding towards its opening ceremony without anyone but a few nervous civil servants being troubled by visions of a bureaucratic hell.</p> <p>Its founding idea appeared as sensible as requiring feckless fathers to pay for the upkeep of their children. The Government would allow the police to disclose the criminal records of job applicants looking to work with children to employers. Paedophiles would be uncovered and everyone else would feel a great deal safer.</p> <p>Repressiveness has its own momentum, however. A justifiable invasion of privacy for the few looks like becoming a trap for the many. Ministers liked the idea of prying so much they decided everyone's criminal records should be opened. All applicants will have to reveal if their pasts were shady or pure. The new criminal records agency will be vetting 10 million people a year - say highest estimates - when it begins work in the summer.</p> <p>Snooping will deter the hiring of ex-offenders and leave them with no option but to return to their thieving ways - hardly an intelligent crime-fighting strategy - even if the agency manages to release accurate records efficiently.</p> <p>There are good grounds for wondering if it will manage that basic task. Earlier this year I wrote about a Metropolitan Police report on the reliability of criminal records, which Scotland Yard was anxious suppress. Officers examined a random selection, it said, and found an 'overall error rate of 86 per cent'. Eighty-five per cent of the these were 'major errors, i.e. those that could potentially lead to... the possibility of financial compensation awards to those affected'.</p> <p>Even if the figures are a freak and other police forces record keeping is far better than the Met's, hundreds of thousands of people will be denied work because of fictitious crimes on their files. They would then have every reason to sue the Home Office. As would employers if they were not warned about the previous of convicted frauds before entrusting them with money.</p> <p>Because this is New Labour, only a private company is deemed fit to run the agency. The winner of the contract was Capita plc. What is worrying the Home Office civil servants who watched private contractors freeze the computers of the Passport Office and asylum department is that Capita's own record is worthy of examination. The complaints about Capita's delays in processing housing benefit claims in South London, upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, stand out starkly.</p> <p>I'm sorry to crystal-ball gaze again, but it is at least possible that employers won't be getting criminal records by return of post. Applicants may well be left in limbo and on the dole waiting for a file that may be libellously inaccurate.</p>",

The ancient rights of the British to protest are as much a part of a flattering national myth as the notion that mobs only bring down Ministries in a sinister place called Abroad. Like the Child Support Agency before it, the National Criminal Records Agency is plodding towards its opening ceremony without anyone but a few nervous civil servants being troubled by visions of a bureaucratic hell. Its founding idea appeared as sensible as requiring feckless fathers to pay for the upkeep of their children. The Government would allow the police to disclose the criminal records of job applicants looking to work with children to employers. Paedophiles would be uncovered and everyone else would feel a great deal safer. Repressiveness has its own momentum, however. A justifiable invasion of privacy for the few looks like becoming a trap for the many. Ministers liked the idea of prying so much they decided everyone's criminal records should be opened. All applicants will have to reveal if their pasts were shady or pure. The new criminal records agency will be vetting 10 million people a year - say highest estimates - when it begins work in the summer. Snooping will deter the hiring of ex-offenders and leave them with no option but to return to their thieving ways - hardly an intelligent crime-fighting strategy - even if the agency manages to release accurate records efficiently. There are good grounds for wondering if it will manage that basic task. Earlier this year I wrote about a Metropolitan Police report on the reliability of criminal records, which Scotland Yard was anxious suppress. Officers examined a random selection, it said, and found an 'overall error rate of 86 per cent'. Eighty-five per cent of the these were 'major errors, i.e. those that could potentially lead to... the possibility of financial compensation awards to those affected'. Even if the figures are a freak and other police forces record keeping is far better than the Met's, hundreds of thousands of people will be denied work because of fictitious crimes on their files. They would then have every reason to sue the Home Office. As would employers if they were not warned about the previous of convicted frauds before entrusting them with money. Because this is New Labour, only a private company is deemed fit to run the agency. The winner of the contract was Capita plc. What is worrying the Home Office civil servants who watched private contractors freeze the computers of the Passport Office and asylum department is that Capita's own record is worthy of examination. The complaints about Capita's delays in processing housing benefit claims in South London, upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, stand out starkly. I'm sorry to crystal-ball gaze again, but it is at least possible that employers won't be getting criminal records by return of post. Applicants may well be left in limbo and on the dole waiting for a file that may be libellously inaccurate.",

The reports conclude that Britain's battered railways will take 10 years to bring up to scratch because so many thousands of miles of track are classified as being in poor or very poor condition. The figures reveal the huge extent of the crisis facing Railtrack following the accident at Hatfield in which four people were killed. The report by Booz Allen says that up to 11 per cent of track checked between 1994 and 1998 was below a satisfactory standard. At the present rate of track replacement it will take until 2010 for all stretches of poor rail to be upgraded. 'They are simply not spending enough,' said Jonathan Bray, railway expert with the pressure group, Transport 2000. 'In Japan a broken rail is unheard of.

He will urge the company to spend much more on maintaining and improving track, despite the knock-on effect of delays and cancellations. The Health and Safety Executive is also pushing for new safety guidelines for the train operating companies in the wake of the three fatal train crashes over the last three years at Southall, Ladbroke Grove and Hatfield. Options being considered include airline-style safety briefings for passengers, crumple zones for train carriages and new designs for rolling stock to ensure that trains remain upright even if they derail at high speed. The fatalities in last week's crash were caused when the buffet car tipped over and the roof was peeled off by overhead electrical gantries. John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, who is expected to make an emergency statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday, is set to announce new proposals for an overall safety body that would control all types of transport. He has been struck by the confusing differences in safety rules that govern trains, the airline industry and buses. Legal sources said yesterday that Railtrack will almost certainly face criminal prosecution as a result of the Hatfield derailment with the prospect of large fines for serious breaches of safety laws. A source close to the investigation teams said: 'Railtrack must be absolutely smack bang in the middle of it. I do not believe they can escape prosecution of one sort or another.'

The next few days will be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the nineteenth birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there will be a different anniversary: 'She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year, when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.' There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestures towards the house behind her: 'It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day. He was, she adds, 'one of the gangbangers - fighting for territory'.</p> <p>This is not the Bronx or Southside Chicago - this is a rural hamlet called Coahoma on the Mississippi reaches, in the heart of the Delta, an area which a nearby Pastor, Benny Brown, calls 'not a \"rural area\" but more of a reservation.

The end of the accursedly dry Southern summer, and of the cotton harvest, is no time for celebration in these communities around the town of Clarksdale. Forty per cent of people here survive below the poverty line, which is set at $16,000 for a family of four. With the summer work now gone, the onset of Fall only serves to remind those who watch the seasons come and go from their porches and roadside perches that whatever the rhetoric from those now campaigning to become the next President of the United States, the reality will almost certainly pass them by: that theirs is the land that politics forgot; that as the sound and fury of the election increases, with only a fortnight to go, their 'reservation' is the price paid for the economic boom on which the election rides.</p> <p>The boom economy is the toast of a contemporary America, awash with money that has enriched not only the wealthy and superwealthy but a burgeoning middle class. The toast, too, of America's presidential election with both candidates debating how to spend the most lavish budget surplus in the country's history.</p> <p>George Bush's appeal is a brazen one: a windfall for those he sees as having generated the wealth - the rich and super-rich, with gestures of reward to the middle strata. Al Gore tried to make his central pledge to 'working families' but has been obliged to let the term slip from his lexicon of late, in favour of 'the middle class'.</p> <p>The fact is that there is little or no political capital to be gained by fighting for the votes of the poor in America, since - for the most part - the poor do not vote. But they exist: the underbelly is always there, either prop ping up the system or consuming its welfare dollars, whichever way you look at it; an underbelly that swells along with the wastelands where it lives, trapped in its own economic hex, out of sight and largely out of mind.</p> <p>In Mississippi, at the last Presidential election, only 33 per cent voted; in Coahoma County, even fewer. Around Clarksdale, people pay Washington as little mind as Washington pays to Clarksdale.</p> <p>When President Clinton came to office there was a grandiose plan to reform healthcare - which fell by the wayside. There was an 'initiative on race' entrusted to a special panel kept on such a tight rein that its members could not say what they wanted to say. Finally came the 'welfare reform' of 1996 which removed tens of thousands from the benefits rolls and sent them into jobs they often lost within weeks either through ineptitude or inability to live the working life.</p> <p>Clarkesdale is the epicentre of that which in eighteenth-century England was called the 'Blue Devils', adapted by plantation-speak during the 1890s to 'the Blues'. It is the town in which the famous 'Crossroads' is located at which the master of all bluesmen, Robert Johnson, is said to have sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his wizardry on the guitar. The old Negro lore has it that the musician must 'take a black cat bone and a guitar and go to a lonely fork in the road at midnight'. The guitarist will soon be joined by an 'unseen musician' who will 'play in perfect unison' before taking his instrument away from him - although the sound will continue until our guitarist's fingertips bleed. 'The music,' runs the legend, 'will eventually subside, and when all is quiet, you may go home. You will be able to play any piece you desire on the guitar, but you will have sold your eternal soul and are his in the world to come.' The crossroads is that between Highway 61, which splices America in two, north-south, and Highway 49 - now marked by a bricked-up, former laundromat.</p> <p>It was on a farm called Hopson, now site of an annual blues festival, that another Devil claimed many souls in Clarksdale: the first mechanical cotton-picking machine, which led to the mechanisation of the plantations, and began the great migrations north that in turn created the ghettoes of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, New York and Boston.</p> <p>And Clarksdale is also the Delta town through which Bill Clinton blew like a hurricane during his 'Poverty Tour' of July last year, in the footsteps of a similar journey made by Bobby Kennedy in 1967. There was a meeting with the locals in a flower store called 'Ooh So Pretty Flowers' managed by Shirley Fair, who has a collection of thick photo albums and likes the President because he 'cares about poor folks'. But, she says: 'Nothing has gotten any better. There's nothing here to grasp on to. The railroad is closed, the factories have gone. The good folks move on and the gangbangers take over the streets and that makes it harder for businesses to survive. The President wrote me a letter saying I could apply for a grant and employ 10 people. But there were so many rules and regulations I couldn't understand nothing. Always something to slow you and stop you. So I did.'</p> <p>The President had actually wanted to visit another place just north of Clarksdale, a much smaller rural community called Jonestown, but his spin doctors advised him against it - for reasons that become immediately apparent when one pulls into Main Street, whose sign lies on a scrap of grass next to an empty beer bottle.</p> <p>The approach to us here is a little different from that in Coahoma. In response to the first whites within living memory to buy beer and pecan nuts at the Deer Park grocery, a man with a hood over his head forms a pretend gun barrel with his index and middle fingers, flicks off the (thumb) safety catch and opens fire, with recoil. For the most part, however, a smile and some heartfelt respect meets nothing but hospitality and a return grin in places to which those above the poverty line never go.</p> <p>There is portrait of John F. Kennedy painted on one of the boarded-up store fronts - the paint is faded, the glass is smashed. The few businesses left open hide behind grills.</p> <p>Jonestown's mayor is also the town's Pentecostal Pastor, a pensive man and disarmingly honest about his isolation from power politics and the magnitude of his task, to the edge of hopelessness - but not over it. 'This was,' says Mayor Joe Phillips, 'a thriving rural community 20 years ago - the employment was farm labour - then came mechanisation, and people moved away. Then the whites left, and took the businesses with them. The buildings became dilapidated and fell in'.</p> <p>To try to stave off this decay, 'money is occasionally promised to the community,' says Phillips, from both federal and state funds. 'But when it is promised, it gets expended elsewhere. It always seems to disappears some place else, it doesn't get filtered down. They'll say that \"administration costs\" count for 30 per cent.' Why? 'Politics,' he replies simply. 'That's the bottom line. You can't just wait for things to happen. We are saying that to do anything, we have go to do it with private funding and we have got to do it ourselves'.</p> <p>Phillips's calling is, he says, to 'instill in people's minds that they can become self-sufficient, and dignified. Otherwise they are going to end up breaking up, tearing up. But I guess,' he adds, as though uttering some personal confession, 'that it's very solitary work. Very isolated. People stay away from you so that when you get hit, they won't feel the results. But I've always believed in the impossible; Jesus said: \"bring the blind man unto me, that he may see\".'</p> <p>The forecourt of the Deer Park Grocery is a gathering place for those wrenched from the land by the new demands of the 'Cotton Kingdom': a ragbag of gang fighters and those 'breaking up, tearing up', and their daytime lady friends, under the watchful eye of the sheriff's deputy. Or just people who may be heading that way, like Albert Mitchell. 'I always worked the farm,' says Albert, 'but now all the work is seasonal. The harvest is in, and you get cut. When I'm working, I don't drink. But when I'm not working you get jack shit to live on; I do a bit of plumbing and I drink. So now my wife is throwing me out, with the kids and all that.'</p> <p>Also among the company is Juliet Shaw, holding her baby - one of two, though she is only 18. She lives on the welfare payments for which young women like her are infamous and an easy target for political polemic, like most of the mothers at a Montessori school run by a Roman Catholic mission in the town centre. The nuns arrived in the building, a crack den, on 6 January 1993, and by 11 January the children had begun to arrive. 'Some of them,' says Sister Theresa Shields, watching basketball practice, 'go back to wonderful homes - others to appalling, abusive ones.' As she speaks, a car pulls out, blaring loud rap music: 'See You In Hell, Motherfucker!'.</p> <p>Not everyone in Jonestown is either locked in struggle or downcast by melancholia. Indeed, as he hobbles with his stick down a lazy, sunny street, it seems that nothing under the Delta sky could wipe the smile off Willie Gilbert's face. Willie was a truck driver earning reasonable money until a wheel crashed down on his ankle during a tyre change eight years ago. He doesn't find it easy to get by on his $500-a-month disability pension, but has adopted his own approach: 'eat slow'. And while eating slow,he looks back on his life: 'Now how many children I got? Got a whole bunch of 'em. Woulda had 29 if they'd all lived. Got 11 by one woman. Got two in California, boys. Got one in Washington DC. Don't know how many grandchildren...' But for one of his neighbours, memories of sweet times only make the present bitter. As Walhida sits on her porch, flies feast on the infected, weeping sore above her right eye.</p> <p>As ever in the Mississippi Delta, the greater the tribulations of this world, the more people cling to the promise of the next. Benny Brown peeps out from behind the hatch of the little kiosk caf\u00e9 he keeps on Main Street, selling 'Hog's Maws' and 'Chicken Gizzards'. Benny talks through his spectacles and between orders about 'poverty pockets' and 'reservations, weighing up the 'pre-King' and 'post-King' epochs on the Delta plains, and of the trade-off between the winning of civil rights and the loss of any kind of opportunity in the comfortless rural ghettoes that followed in their wake, embittering - and mocking - the sweetness of victory. On those 'reservations', Benny sees a 'vicious cycle' of 'poverty which creates problems that only deepen the problems further' - 'an influx of drugs, alcohol and crime'. Benny has his own view on how the cycle has to be broken and accordingly invites us to a Bible study class.</p> <p>A misty dusk - illuminated by a fat, low golden moon - settles on the ploughed plantation fields, as Benny hoists a man called Rickie out of his car, onto a wheelchair and up the ramp of the little white slatwood church that stands alone. 'Wherever there are churches,' says Benny, 'there were communities. Now they have gone'. The preacher is Brother Stevens, who looks a blend of Richie Havens and Rasputin, and the scripture for study tonight - after a prayer of invocation sung with passion and volume and interrupted with cries of 'Halleluiah! and 'Oh Yes!' - is the seventh chapter in the Book of Ecclesiastes. 'The heart of fools is in the house of pleasure... If you the poor are oppressed in a district / And justice and rights are denied / Do not be surprised by such things / For one official is eyed by a higher one / And over them both are others higher still'.</p> <p>Benny invites the meeting to recall Clinton's visit, and how 'many of us saw the motorcade go by - but is it any better now?' No, the company agrees. 'We can expect nobody to help us from outside,' says Benny, 'Look for change from within. From within yourself, and from within your community.'</p> <p>Not all of Benny Brown's reservations are black, of course. Many are Hispanic, along the border towns of Texas, Arizona and California, where squads of white vigilantes now take the law and their semi-automatic guns into their own hands. The native, first Americans occupy the dustiest and most comfortless acres of land to which they were dispatched a century and a half ago. And there are, in their way, white reservations too - in Appalachia and across the vast prairies and plains, but it is in the South and in particular the black South with its legacy of slavery and segregation (the Confederate flag is still proudly stitched into that of the state of Mississippi) that 'poverty pockets' are at their worst. There is a 'New South' to be sure: with its dynamic capital of Atlanta and a formidable Attorney General in Mississippi, Mike Moore, who is prising open the sealed secrets of crimes by the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and church burning in the 1960s, to win a string of convictions.</p> <p>But the depth of poverty in black Mississippi remains, frankly, shocking. The Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta has reported, in the past few months, serious clusters of diabetes, hepatitis and Aids around poor communities, where some 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.</p> <p>Back in Jonestown, the night is young, and as it falls one realises that Benny and his fellow-churchgoers are engaged in a state of what is, for them, apocalyptic war. Down at the Club Sugar - a ramshackle brick cabin beside the railroad track - those parking cars are invited by the girls if they want to 'have a little fun tonight'. Lads like 'Q', with his blue bandanna, are arriving to drown their sorrows and thoughts in the barrage of rap music while his friend 'Icy Man', although in the middle of a conversation, pulls hard on a tube of 'rocks', his eyes glazing over, his face frozen in oblivion. Mayor Phillips had warned how 'the drug pushers have been pushed out of the bigger towns and are now targeting the little ones. And the more they come, the more we get break-ins, prostitution.'</p> <p>It's like finding the old Seventies Bronx in the middle of a twenty-first century cotton plantation and the crowd soon moves to a joint nearer the village centre, Hot Spot. We ask if we can take pictures of the heaving and dancing, to be told politely that this would be a 'bad idea because a lot of the guys here are wanted'. The guys accordingly hit the floor as the girls shake their stuff - only for the festivities to be abruptly brought to a close by the sudden and robust entry of a posse of (very white) police officers. 'They're serious,' says our host, Clee - who dislikes rap and who dreams mainly of setting up a blues band in town - 'they're not local, they're County'.</p> <p>On a street that runs adjacent to the Sunflower River through Clarksdale, there's a ramshackle but precious hotel with a history to tell that encapsulates all the pain and emotion of Benny Brown's 'poverty pocket'. The Riverside Hotel dates from the days when blacks were not allowed to stay in 'white' hotels; it is where singer Bessie Smith was taken to die; it's where the blues masters stayed and now where the labourers - the 'weeklies' - live, and where the blues pilgrims, mostly from overseas, come to visit.</p> <p>The joint is run by 'Rat' Cliffe, son of the lady who opened it and the wisest guy in town, now in his seventies. 'It's something like folks want to stay poor around here,' says Rat impatiently, working his spindly fingers around his cigarette end. 'Up there in Tunica they build casinos. But they wouldn't have 'em here - politics and the churches. In other places you got people wanting to work for themselves, like in Chicago, do something, get a sense of pride. But here, you know what has killed this place?' And here is a surprise from a man at the heart of the black community. 'Welfare. It stops people working. Why should a man go all the way to Tunica to work 40 hours a week and 10 hours travelling for $600 a month if he can get that from the welfare? Why go to work as a young woman when you can get paid just for having babies?'</p> <p>The sun is now low in the evening sky over the cotton fields outside Ruby Walker's home; the cats savouring the last of the heat. Ruby's grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields; 'And so was I, after a fashion,' she reflects. 'We worked from sun up to sundown, and the money was cheap.' Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, adds Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: 'I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the Forties than it is now'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As a late sun stroked the last of this year's cotton, like billows of man-made clouds, old Ruby Walker sat on her porch with most of her 22 cats frolicking around her. The next few days will be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the nineteenth birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there will be a different anniversary: 'She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year, when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.' There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestures towards the house behind her: 'It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day. He was, she adds, 'one of the gangbangers - fighting for territory'. This is not the Bronx or Southside Chicago - this is a rural hamlet called Coahoma on the Mississippi reaches, in the heart of the Delta, an area which a nearby Pastor, Benny Brown, calls 'not a \"rural area\" but more of a reservation. A black poverty reservation.' 'Reservation' is an apposite description of the poverty hidden from view, hidden from politicians, from those surfing the economic boom and hidden from America's presence in the world. They are deep wells of apparently irredeemable poverty, a dark side of the America which preens itself in front of the mirror with each jump of the Nasdaq and every State of the Union speech and offers itself to the planet in chat shows, mini series, and tales of dotcom billionaires in business magazines. This is an America which will never make even a cameo appearance on Friends or a footnote in Forbes or Business Week . While there is appalling poverty among white people in some places, these reservations are for the most part territory into which whites dare not venture and would not think to venture. In Coahoma, a little girl approaches my photographer: 'Sir, are you a white man?' 'Do I look white?' he replies. 'I guess,' she says. 'Is your friend a white man too?' This year's cotton is almost in, packed into great bales of white that dot the vast flatscape of the Delta, rising from the rich earth of 'Cotton Kingdom'. There are still a few fields left and loose cotton still blows across the earth and roads like a light, fluffy blizzard. But what the hell. The end of the accursedly dry Southern summer, and of the cotton harvest, is no time for celebration in these communities around the town of Clarksdale. Forty per cent of people here survive below the poverty line, which is set at $16,000 for a family of four. With the summer work now gone, the onset of Fall only serves to remind those who watch the seasons come and go from their porches and roadside perches that whatever the rhetoric from those now campaigning to become the next President of the United States, the reality will almost certainly pass them by: that theirs is the land that politics forgot; that as the sound and fury of the election increases, with only a fortnight to go, their 'reservation' is the price paid for the economic boom on which the election rides. The boom economy is the toast of a contemporary America, awash with money that has enriched not only the wealthy and superwealthy but a burgeoning middle class. The toast, too, of America's presidential election with both candidates debating how to spend the most lavish budget surplus in the country's history. George Bush's appeal is a brazen one: a windfall for those he sees as having generated the wealth - the rich and super-rich, with gestures of reward to the middle strata. Al Gore tried to make his central pledge to 'working families' but has been obliged to let the term slip from his lexicon of late, in favour of 'the middle class'. The fact is that there is little or no political capital to be gained by fighting for the votes of the poor in America, since - for the most part - the poor do not vote. But they exist: the underbelly is always there, either prop ping up the system or consuming its welfare dollars, whichever way you look at it; an underbelly that swells along with the wastelands where it lives, trapped in its own economic hex, out of sight and largely out of mind. In Mississippi, at the last Presidential election, only 33 per cent voted; in Coahoma County, even fewer. Around Clarksdale, people pay Washington as little mind as Washington pays to Clarksdale. When President Clinton came to office there was a grandiose plan to reform healthcare - which fell by the wayside. There was an 'initiative on race' entrusted to a special panel kept on such a tight rein that its members could not say what they wanted to say. Finally came the 'welfare reform' of 1996 which removed tens of thousands from the benefits rolls and sent them into jobs they often lost within weeks either through ineptitude or inability to live the working life.

The guitarist will soon be joined by an 'unseen musician' who will 'play in perfect unison' before taking his instrument away from him - although the sound will continue until our guitarist's fingertips bleed. 'The music,' runs the legend, 'will eventually subside, and when all is quiet, you may go home. You will be able to play any piece you desire on the guitar, but you will have sold your eternal soul and are his in the world to come.' The crossroads is that between Highway 61, which splices America in two, north-south, and Highway 49 - now marked by a bricked-up, former laundromat. It was on a farm called Hopson, now site of an annual blues festival, that another Devil claimed many souls in Clarksdale: the first mechanical cotton-picking machine, which led to the mechanisation of the plantations, and began the great migrations north that in turn created the ghettoes of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, New York and Boston. And Clarksdale is also the Delta town through which Bill Clinton blew like a hurricane during his 'Poverty Tour' of July last year, in the footsteps of a similar journey made by Bobby Kennedy in 1967.

On a street that runs adjacent to the Sunflower River through Clarksdale, there's a ramshackle but precious hotel with a history to tell that encapsulates all the pain and emotion of Benny Brown's 'poverty pocket'. The Riverside Hotel dates from the days when blacks were not allowed to stay in 'white' hotels; it is where singer Bessie Smith was taken to die; it's where the blues masters stayed and now where the labourers - the 'weeklies' - live, and where the blues pilgrims, mostly from overseas, come to visit. The joint is run by 'Rat' Cliffe, son of the lady who opened it and the wisest guy in town, now in his seventies. 'It's something like folks want to stay poor around here,' says Rat impatiently, working his spindly fingers around his cigarette end. 'Up there in Tunica they build casinos. But they wouldn't have 'em here - politics and the churches. In other places you got people wanting to work for themselves, like in Chicago, do something, get a sense of pride. But here, you know what has killed this place?' And here is a surprise from a man at the heart of the black community. 'Welfare. It stops people working. Why should a man go all the way to Tunica to work 40 hours a week and 10 hours travelling for $600 a month if he can get that from the welfare? Why go to work as a young woman when you can get paid just for having babies?' The sun is now low in the evening sky over the cotton fields outside Ruby Walker's home; the cats savouring the last of the heat. Ruby's grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields; 'And so was I, after a fashion,' she reflects. 'We worked from sun up to sundown, and the money was cheap.' Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, adds Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: 'I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the Forties than it is now'.",

      "bodyText": "Israel put itself on a collision course with its Arab neighbours last night as it suggested it was ready to pre-empt a declaration of a Palestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem by issuing its own statement of 'unilateral separation' on its own terms. In moves that would undo a decade of peace negotiations, Israeli sources indicated that government officials were preparing contingency plans for total separation from Palestinian-administered areas. Amid fears that would involve the annexation of large areas claimed for the undeclared Palestinian state, sources admitted that Israel was laying the ground for a declaration of its final status borders. The plan is being overseen by Ephraim Sneh, the Israeli Deputy Defence Minister. If enacted, it would see a return to the so-called 'Iron Wall' model of Israeli security policy, long discarded in favour of a policy of Palestian-Israeli co-existence. In an interview in today's New York Times, Sneh said he understood the psychological appeal for Israelis of separating from the Palestinians. 'People say, \"I don't want to see any more the Palestinians\",' he said. 'But it doesn't work that way. The interdependence of the economies is such that you can't just detach them mechanically.' In its most absolute form, Israel would separate by creating its own borders, thereby carving out a Palestinian state as well, although in a form unlikely to be acceptable to Palestinians. In its narrowest form, it would be a kind of extended border closure, sealing off Palestinian areas. The disclosure of Israel's preparations for a unilateral declaration of its final status borders came as Palestinian President Yasser Arafat accused Israel of a wholesale 'massacre' of the Palestinian people. He was speaking at an emergency summit in Cairo. At the summit Saudi Arabia appeared to fuel the conflict, pledging a $1 billion package to support the 'Al-Aqsa intifada' - named for the clash at the Jerusalem mosque that triggered the recent violence. Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia also criticised the US, saying that as sponsors of the peace process they should bear responsibility for its failure. In his most uncompromising comments of the three-week crisis, Arafat promised fellow Arab leaders that his people would struggle against Israel until they won 'victory'. Meanwhile Israeli troops and Palestinians battled at flashpoints in the West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday, leaving five dead and at least 50 Palestinians injured. An Israeli Army spokesman said soldiers had fired at Palestinians who shot at troops guarding Gush Katif, a Jewish settlement in Gaza. Israeli officials have accused Arafat of fanning the violence to try to toughen the Arab summit's line against Israel.

Everything touched by the state is, by definition, a disaster.</p> <p>The whole campaign, like all swings in fashion, has gone too far. Of course, there is a strong case for the public sector opening up and establishing partnerships with the private sector. Networks and alliances are everywhere becoming the standard form of organisation, accelerated by the advent of information technology, and the public sector needs to move beyond being a top-down, insular, organisational silo. It should look for outside capital and expertise to aid it in its mission. But this is a very different proposition from trying to privatise it out of existence on the grounds that it is necessarily incompetent and poor value for money.</p> <p>The consequence of the four deaths in Hatfield on the King's Cross-Leeds train last week, following the deaths at Paddington and Southall, may mean that the anti-public-sector pendulum finally starts to swing back. Defenders of privatisation argue that these tragedies mask the overall improvement in safety under the new regime, but that misses the point. The overall transport position is terrible; sky-high fares, overcrowded and unreliable trains and the worst safety record in Europe. Because the rail system is fragmented in its operations and regulation, and because the pursuit of shareholder value is the overriding objective of its operators, any improvement in service and safety will necessarily lag behind the rest of the world.</p> <p>Japan has not suffered one rail death since 1964, despite operating many more trains. This is the consequence of sustained investment within a publicly owned rail system together with a management culture in which safety and service are paramount. In Britain, the emphasis is on 'value for money' - code for maximising short-term profits and minimising investment - and a management culture which prizes personal enrichment and deal-making. If we are to change this culture, the state will have to act to reintegrate the system, toughen regulations and enlarge its own role.</p> <p>Indeed, the last comprehensive spending review began this process, increasing the flows of support for new investment, but, unlike any private investor, insisted on no additional shares in exchange for its largesse nor any change in the structure. It is an unsustainable position. Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive, told Newsnight on Friday that the current rail structure had not been designed to 'optimise safety, optimise investment or indeed cope with the huge increase in the number of passengers the railways have seen'. Instead, he favoured a public/private partnership around which the rail system could be reintegrated and, by inference, where the entire conception of 'value for money' could be broadened so that passengers' interests rank alongside those of shareholders and the Treasury.</p> <p>He is right, but only partially. I led an independent Industrial Society inquiry into the proposed public/private partnership for London Underground. It is a better structure than the rail system; a publicly owned LU accountable to the mayor will run the trains while only the infrastructure - the rolling stock, tunnels, signalling and track - is to be turned over to the private sector. But, importantly, it is to be kept together, so at least there won't be trains owned by one company wearing out track owned by another, as in the Hatfield disaster.</p> <p>But the system will still be fragmented. LU will run trains maintained and bought by one of the three private consortia which will be contracted to manage the infrastructure of three parcels of Underground lines for 30 years. Just as in the rail system, fragmentation makes safety harder because responsibility is diffused between different operators - and safety costs money. Nor is there any real threat of one of the consortia losing its franchise if it does not achieve the required safety standards. London would have to pay such high compensation to sever a contract that the proposition is untenable.</p> <p>So it is that the PPP can be presented as better 'value for money' than any public-sector alternative only by putting little effective price tag on values like safety, accountability or the capacity to run an integrated transport system. That seemed dubious enough, but what shocked the team was the way the comparisons are cooked to make private efficiency gains look better. For example, the introduction of the Private Finance Initiative has been marked by a rash of delays and cost overruns; Northern Line trains financed by the PFI, for example, were two years late being delivered.</p> <p>One example particularly shocked me. Our simulations showed that the PPP would have to throw up 21 per cent efficiency gains to improve on what would occur in a conservatively run LU that had the autonomy to plan and finance its investment, like the private consortia, over 30 years. We compared that with the 17 per cent efficiency gains widely assumed to have occurred in PFI schemes. The gains seemed achievable - until we learned that more than half those assumed efficiency gains are not hard cash at all. Instead, they are estimates of the value of transferring risk to the private sector, although when you examine both PPP and PFI contracts in detail you wonder how much serious risk has been transferred.</p> <p>So if Gerald Corbett is thinking of remodelling the rail industry around the LU PPP, I would advise caution. Rail operators and the infrastructure provider certainly need to be brought together as in the LU PPP, but it needs to be within a more accountable framework than a 30-year contract and where there are serious and enforceable penalties for non-compliance with any contracts.</p> <p>The resulting companies, as we recommend in our report, must genuinely want to offer service, safety and investment within an integrated transport system as their prime objectives rather than maximising shareholder value as their prime and sole target.</p> <p>That either means constituting them as stakeholder companies, or taking a significant public stake and placing non-executive directors on their boards to represent the public interest. It may even be that the best system would be an integrated London Underground and reconstituted British Rail with majority public ownership but with the independent capacity to issue their own bonds and plan their own investment, with the necessary Treasury support.</p> <p>For the truth will out. The left-wing ideologues who disregarded the waste and inefficiency of public ownership are rightly excoriated today. But the right-wing ideologues in the Major and Blair governments who are pushing private-sector solutions too far today, disregarding their implications for safety and accountability, will be equally damned in the future.</p> <p>What matters is what works, and we are learning the hard way that that is not always the private sector.</p>",

The thirty-something author, Stephanie Theobald, based it on her experience of living in the low-rent Barb\u00e8s-Rochechouart area in the early Nineties. </p> <p>'I am pleased that World TV plans to keep the story set in Paris,' she told The Observer. 'This may well make the whole thing work. We've seen enough on our screens about living in London. And it's time to get rid of the old ideas about Paris. It's not full of people in black polo-necks or Chanel suits anymore.' </p> <p>The heroine of Biche, George, shares a down-at-heel apartment with a gay male friend called Holly. In a typical scene from the novel, Holly greets George and her new black male conquest late one night, 'Already on Africa then?' Holly asks as he hands over the condoms. </p> <p>The TV company was attracted to the story partly because of its bisexual element. This Life gained notoriety and support from the gay community for its upfront handling of homosexual encounters. The candid approach to homosexuality of Channel Four's Queer As Folk, was judged a key part of its ratings success. </p> <p>'It is not really that surprising,' said Theobald, 'because it is the one thing that has not been possible to do before now. There is still a lot of scope.' </p> <p>The comedian Kathy Burke's BBC1 series Gimme, Gimme, Gimme was one of the first to feature a gay male in a sympathetic leading role and stand-up comic Rhona Cameron recently devised her own lesbian sitcom, Rhona, for BBC2. Biche will be the first serious drama series to feature a bisexual heroine. </p> <p>Theobald, the daughter of a fish and chip shop owner, told The Observer she would be disappointed if the series is watered down for television. </p> <p>'If that was going to happen, I would rather it was made into a film instead, or at least that it went to a company who were prepared to be truer to the book,' she said. </p> <p>An independent feature film company has also shown strong interest in Biche before its publication next month. 'If it is made into a film the character of Holly should really be played by Brad Pitt,' said Theobald. 'The guy it was based on always wanted to be Brad Pitt. I would like to be played by Drew Barrymore or perhaps Chloe Sevigny.' </p> <p>Another gay series, the Emmy award-winning Will And Grace, is now one of the most popular shows in America and has been bought up for transmission in this country soon. The show is about a gay male lawyer and a straight female decorator who live next door to each other.</p>",

In a typical scene from the novel, Holly greets George and her new black male conquest late one night, 'Already on Africa then?' Holly asks as he hands over the condoms. The TV company was attracted to the story partly because of its bisexual element. This Life gained notoriety and support from the gay community for its upfront handling of homosexual encounters. The candid approach to homosexuality of Channel Four's Queer As Folk, was judged a key part of its ratings success. 'It is not really that surprising,' said Theobald, 'because it is the one thing that has not been possible to do before now. There is still a lot of scope.' The comedian Kathy Burke's BBC1 series Gimme, Gimme, Gimme was one of the first to feature a gay male in a sympathetic leading role and stand-up comic Rhona Cameron recently devised her own lesbian sitcom, Rhona, for BBC2. Biche will be the first serious drama series to feature a bisexual heroine. Theobald, the daughter of a fish and chip shop owner, told The Observer she would be disappointed if the series is watered down for television. 'If that was going to happen, I would rather it was made into a film instead, or at least that it went to a company who were prepared to be truer to the book,' she said. An independent feature film company has also shown strong interest in Biche before its publication next month. 'If it is made into a film the character of Holly should really be played by Brad Pitt,' said Theobald. 'The guy it was based on always wanted to be Brad Pitt. I would like to be played by Drew Barrymore or perhaps Chloe Sevigny.' Another gay series, the Emmy award-winning Will And Grace, is now one of the most popular shows in America and has been bought up for transmission in this country soon. The show is about a gay male lawyer and a straight female decorator who live next door to each other.",

      "body": "<p>As you reap, so shall you sow. For 21 years, first the Conservatives and now New Labour have aspired to deregulate, privatise, contract out and spend every tax pound as meanly as possible. The reasons the state once expanded - to ensure safety, to limit risk, to promote accountability, to assert a common interest - are all believed to be part of a redundant quasi-socialist worldview. Yet every day brings fresh evidence of the baleful results of this attitude to the public sector.</p> <p>Last week another four rail travellers died in one of the developed world's least safe, most expensive and most unreliable rail systems - product of an ill-considered privatisation whose irrational structure New Labour refuses to reconsider. And the Government ploughs on, trying to prove it is really a surrogate Conservative party. It refuses to reconsider its plans for the partial privatisation of London Underground or the air traffic control system. It ponders how further to reduce the so-called burden of regulation. It shrinks from any compulsory assertion of the public interest. It presses ahead with the discredited private finance initiative.</p> <p>The public sector should not remain an island. It needs to form partnerships, alliances and networks with the private sector - and it needs to become more alert to efficiency. But it remains the custodian of important values which cannot be reasonably assumed by the private sector. There is a clash between profit maximisation and safety, as we are learning on the rail network. And private companies are not as ready as they need to be to accept the necessary requirements of accountability and openness when they operate in sensitive public interest areas such as transport, communications, health and education.</p> <p>Nobody with a grain of sense wants to return to a world of monolithic nationalised industries. But equally we need to ditch the absurd proposition that the only alternative is wholesale privatisation, contracting out and deregulation. There is a viable 'third way' with a proper place for public enterprise.

      "bodyText": "As you reap, so shall you sow. For 21 years, first the Conservatives and now New Labour have aspired to deregulate, privatise, contract out and spend every tax pound as meanly as possible. The reasons the state once expanded - to ensure safety, to limit risk, to promote accountability, to assert a common interest - are all believed to be part of a redundant quasi-socialist worldview. Yet every day brings fresh evidence of the baleful results of this attitude to the public sector. Last week another four rail travellers died in one of the developed world's least safe, most expensive and most unreliable rail systems - product of an ill-considered privatisation whose irrational structure New Labour refuses to reconsider. And the Government ploughs on, trying to prove it is really a surrogate Conservative party. It refuses to reconsider its plans for the partial privatisation of London Underground or the air traffic control system. It ponders how further to reduce the so-called burden of regulation. It shrinks from any compulsory assertion of the public interest. It presses ahead with the discredited private finance initiative. The public sector should not remain an island. It needs to form partnerships, alliances and networks with the private sector - and it needs to become more alert to efficiency. But it remains the custodian of important values which cannot be reasonably assumed by the private sector. There is a clash between profit maximisation and safety, as we are learning on the rail network. And private companies are not as ready as they need to be to accept the necessary requirements of accountability and openness when they operate in sensitive public interest areas such as transport, communications, health and education. Nobody with a grain of sense wants to return to a world of monolithic nationalised industries. But equally we need to ditch the absurd proposition that the only alternative is wholesale privatisation, contracting out and deregulation. There is a viable 'third way' with a proper place for public enterprise. Politicians should start by recognising that Britain can no longer continue with the current absurd rail structure inherited from privatisation. Track management and train operation needs re-integration. Safety needs to be understood and paid for. And the Government must direct and finance the construction of a cheap, efficient, integrated transport system, if necessary in partial public ownership. The private sector is good, often very good - but it is time to recognise its limits.",

He asked Clinton to release oil stocks from the strategic reserve so Americans could continue to enjoy driving in the style, and at the price, to which they are accustomed.</p> <p>With all that, Gore's greatest problem remains Clinton, and the sense of shame many Americans feel about having been suckered by one fraud already in the past decade. Gore knows this. The New York Times described how relations between president and vice-president are icier than ever. Gore rarely speaks to Clinton, let alone asks his advice, and each man feels betrayed by the other.</p> <p>But Gore's complaints of betrayal are surely the more abject. Forget Monica: no-one actually thinks that Clinton raped Miss Lewinsky, but many Americans - including Gore - believe he did, in a legal sense, rape Juanita Broaddrick.</p> <p>Asked if he thought this was the case, Gore couldn't answer. A vice-president who believes his Head of State is a rapist is someone who has engaged in a terrifying Faustian bargain. Perhaps it epitomises the bargain many Americans made when they voted for Clinton.</p> <p>The New York Times says cutely that 'the buddy movie that began when these two young Southern centrists started off on a high-energy bus tour across America in the 1992 campaign wasn't supposed to end like this', but then perhaps the buddy movie between Clinton and American liberalism was always likely to end in tears, rage and guilt. If liberals now try to assuage that guilt by taking it out on Al Gore, he truly has no one but himself to blame.</p>",

He asked Clinton to release oil stocks from the strategic reserve so Americans could continue to enjoy driving in the style, and at the price, to which they are accustomed. With all that, Gore's greatest problem remains Clinton, and the sense of shame many Americans feel about having been suckered by one fraud already in the past decade. Gore knows this. The New York Times described how relations between president and vice-president are icier than ever. Gore rarely speaks to Clinton, let alone asks his advice, and each man feels betrayed by the other. But Gore's complaints of betrayal are surely the more abject. Forget Monica: no-one actually thinks that Clinton raped Miss Lewinsky, but many Americans - including Gore - believe he did, in a legal sense, rape Juanita Broaddrick. Asked if he thought this was the case, Gore couldn't answer. A vice-president who believes his Head of State is a rapist is someone who has engaged in a terrifying Faustian bargain. Perhaps it epitomises the bargain many Americans made when they voted for Clinton. The New York Times says cutely that 'the buddy movie that began when these two young Southern centrists started off on a high-energy bus tour across America in the 1992 campaign wasn't supposed to end like this', but then perhaps the buddy movie between Clinton and American liberalism was always likely to end in tears, rage and guilt. If liberals now try to assuage that guilt by taking it out on Al Gore, he truly has no one but himself to blame.",

'This year has been particularly bad because the summer has been so short. I was very excited about using the light box.' </p> <p>But after four days' exposure, Tighe's reaction was less positive: 'It had the same effect as a strong computer screen. It gave me a slight headache and made my eyes dry. I'm not certain there was a connection, but on one night I woke up at 5.30am and on the next I slept for 11 hours. I still have the winter blues.' </p> <p>A spokesman for Philips said: 'The light has a very noticeable effect for 70 to 80 per cent of people.

'I am definitely finding it harder to get out of bed as the winter sets in,' said the 33-year-old graphic designer. 'This year has been particularly bad because the summer has been so short. I was very excited about using the light box.' But after four days' exposure, Tighe's reaction was less positive: 'It had the same effect as a strong computer screen. It gave me a slight headache and made my eyes dry. I'm not certain there was a connection, but on one night I woke up at 5.30am and on the next I slept for 11 hours. I still have the winter blues.' A spokesman for Philips said: 'The light has a very noticeable effect for 70 to 80 per cent of people. No treatment works for everyone.' Beat those winter blues 1 Enjoy any sunlight while you can 2 Take a winter break somewhere warm 3 Eat foods containing tryptophan, eg cottage cheese and turkey, which enhance good feelings 4 Use a light box 5 Consult your GP about treatment for depression 6 Avoid bingeing on carbohydrates which can increase lethargy 7 Try St John's Wort (but not as well as a light box) 8 Avoid sunglasses to maximise exposure to natural light SAD Association ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>More than a third of orders for goods placed via the internet cause problems - including fraud, misplaced or forgotten orders and late deliveries - according to the Institute of Trading Standards. </p> <p>In one study officials had difficulties with 38 per cent of their orders. In another, they found that 25 per cent of websites were insecure. </p> <p>Jennifer Mundie, a market trader of Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, ordered \u00a3554 of Pok\u00e9mon goods from a Chinese website. She realised she had been defrauded when customers returned the children's toys complaining they were fake. 'I felt terrible,' she said after refunding the cash. 'I felt like a criminal because I had sold these items, when in fact I was a victim.' </p> <p>Other dotcom victims were Phil Dart and Karen Gianfreda. After buying a Caribbean holiday worth \u00a32,700 on the web they arrived at their island resort to find one beach (not two as advertised) strewn with signs warning of falling rocks, poisonous fruit and tree sap that caused skin blisters. Swimming in the sea was not allowed and an advertised roller-blading track did not exist. </p> <p>In the first survey, trading standards officials tried to make purchases through 102 British-based internet sites. Some sites veered towards the fraudulent. One officer tried to buy a penknife from a company based in south-west England only for the site to crash after credit card details had been entered. A postal address and telephone number given on the site were false. 'The firm only existed on the internet,' said Simon Cripwell, a trading standards spokesman. </p> <p>For 17 per cent of orders, goods simply failed to appear, either forgotten, out of stock or blamed on 'system crashes'. </p> <p>Most consumer worries about internet shopping have focused on security and giving credit card details over the net. The second survey, of 70 sites, found such concerns are justified: a quarter of sites investigated were insecure - credit card data were not encrypted before being transmitted. Officers also expressed concerns about inaccurate price information and misleading advertising on a third of these 70 sites. </p> <p>'Just as you would avoid disreputable-looking shops in the high street, so you should avoid sites on the internet which look dubious,' said Alan Stevens, in charge of internet-based training for the Consumers' Association. Shoppers should steer clear of sites which ask for credit card details by e-mail or which do not give a telephone number or physical address. A failure to respond to e-mail enquiries is also a bad sign. </p> <p>The CA runs a 'kitemark' scheme whereby internet sites that have met security standards and abide by an accepted code of commercial practice display a red and grey coloured ' Which? Web Trader' logo. </p> <p><strong> Reduce the risks: how to minimise the dangers of being defrauded when internet shopping:</strong> </p> <p>* Don't give credit card details by email. </p> <p>* Avoid buying from sites that don't give a telephone number or physical address. </p> <p>* Look for the Consumers' Association kitemark, the ' Which? Web Trader' logo.</p>",

In one study officials had difficulties with 38 per cent of their orders. In another, they found that 25 per cent of websites were insecure. Jennifer Mundie, a market trader of Mintlaw, Aberdeenshire, ordered \u00a3554 of Pok\u00e9mon goods from a Chinese website. She realised she had been defrauded when customers returned the children's toys complaining they were fake. 'I felt terrible,' she said after refunding the cash. 'I felt like a criminal because I had sold these items, when in fact I was a victim.' Other dotcom victims were Phil Dart and Karen Gianfreda. After buying a Caribbean holiday worth \u00a32,700 on the web they arrived at their island resort to find one beach (not two as advertised) strewn with signs warning of falling rocks, poisonous fruit and tree sap that caused skin blisters. Swimming in the sea was not allowed and an advertised roller-blading track did not exist. In the first survey, trading standards officials tried to make purchases through 102 British-based internet sites. Some sites veered towards the fraudulent. One officer tried to buy a penknife from a company based in south-west England only for the site to crash after credit card details had been entered. A postal address and telephone number given on the site were false. 'The firm only existed on the internet,' said Simon Cripwell, a trading standards spokesman. For 17 per cent of orders, goods simply failed to appear, either forgotten, out of stock or blamed on 'system crashes'. Most consumer worries about internet shopping have focused on security and giving credit card details over the net. The second survey, of 70 sites, found such concerns are justified: a quarter of sites investigated were insecure - credit card data were not encrypted before being transmitted. Officers also expressed concerns about inaccurate price information and misleading advertising on a third of these 70 sites. 'Just as you would avoid disreputable-looking shops in the high street, so you should avoid sites on the internet which look dubious,' said Alan Stevens, in charge of internet-based training for the Consumers' Association. Shoppers should steer clear of sites which ask for credit card details by e-mail or which do not give a telephone number or physical address. A failure to respond to e-mail enquiries is also a bad sign. The CA runs a 'kitemark' scheme whereby internet sites that have met security standards and abide by an accepted code of commercial practice display a red and grey coloured ' Which? Web Trader' logo. Reduce the risks: how to minimise the dangers of being defrauded when internet shopping: * Don't give credit card details by email. * Avoid buying from sites that don't give a telephone number or physical address. * Look for the Consumers' Association kitemark, the ' Which? Web Trader' logo.",

Balfour Beatty uses them to fix the tracks. Railtrack employs Balfour Beatty. The companies that run the trains rely on Railtrack to keep the track operational and their trains running on time. It is privatisation's version of the chain gang, a cascade of responsibility that spilt over last week as the danger that many have been warning about ever since the railway was parcelled into more than 100 pieces and sold off finally became a reality.</p> <p>Yawning in their woolly hats and orange safety vests, the men stubbed out their cigarettes and started to load rail-bashing tools onto a wagon in the grey light of Friday morning. 'We go where the work is and there's going to be lots now they are panicking about every little bump on the track. Lots of overtime - and Christmas is coming,' said an ex-taxi driver. He was pleased about that.</p> <p>An ex-miner was more sombre. Britain's crumbling rail system could not cope with the record traffic levels now thundering over it, he said. 'They are running the high-speed trains like shuttle services these days and the tracks are just not ready for it. And now they are diverting trains on to other bits of track that could be in an even worse state.'</p> <p>Twenty miles away at Hatfield, four carriages still lie on their side, one with its roof ripped off.

Four people died.</p> <p>Yesterday, as the cranes began the grim process of removing the crumpled carriages which are still smeared with blood, the full extent of Britain's rail crisis was becoming clear. A consultant's report reveals that more than 2,000 miles of track are officially categorised as 'poor' or 'very poor'.</p> <p>Clearing up the crash site in Hertfordshire will take weeks. Trains which use the route, one of the busiest in Britain, are now taking up to an hour longer to get from London to Edinburgh. Nearly 100,000 people swamped the National Rail Inquiry helpline last week to find out what was going on. And every time there is a delay and Railtrack work is found to be the cause, the company faces a fine.</p> <p>And that is only the start of it. A train that was derailed near Stafford on Thursday was nowhere near one of the designated 'slow-down' areas. So other parts of the track are also clearly of concern. The public has looked on in bemusement as a torrent of astonishing facts has spilt out. Railtrack knew for months that there were problems with the track in the Hatfield area. Union sources said that train drivers had reported a syndrome of frequent 'rough rides' on that stretch of high speed line. Railtrack sent a letter to Balfour Beatty in April complaining of defects on the line that had not been rectified and 'could lead to a derailment'. A replacement piece of track had been lying beside the line waiting to be fitted since May because Railtrack is finding it increasingly difficult to persuade operators to cut back on the number of trains they run while it shuts the tracks.</p> <p>There was no speed restriction in force because a primary concern is getting the trains to run on time. If they don't, Railtrack faces huge fines. Such is the complexity of the present way of managing the railway. sorted out.</p> <p>At 7.30pm local time last Tuesday John Prescott's flight touched down in Chongking, a huge urban sprawl in south-east China during a ministerial visit. At 7.35pm his secure mobile phone rang. It was his office in London. There has been a train crash, Prescott was told. It looks bad.</p> <p>Arriving at his hotel, Prescott set up a conference call with Lord Macdonald, the Transport Minister. Macdonald told the Deputy Prime Minister that he was holding off visiting the site until it was clear exactly what had happened. Prescott agreed.</p> <p>But there was a problem. The next day most of the Cabinet would be in Glasgow for Donald Dewar's funeral. Macdonald was supposed to be there, leaving open the possibility that on one of the most important days for Britain's rail industry there would be no one to handle the crisis in London. Macdonald began plans to cancel his trip north.</p> <p>At 1am, 9pm in London, and with the certain knowledge that four people had died, Prescott spoke to the Prime Minister. Tony Blair had to be at Dewar's funeral and was then travelling to Seoul to make the important announcement that diplomatic links were to be restored with North Korea. Prescott would have to get back.</p> <p>At 5am on Thursday, Prescott's flight from Hong Kong touched down at Heathrow. By now the story was running away with itself. Gerald Corbett, the chief executive of Railtrack whose offer of resignation had been turned down, had told BBC's Newsnight that the railway system had been ripped apart by privatisation, and that the whole complicated structure should be slimmed down.</p> <p>Prescott was furious. Corbett appeared to be making rail policy on the hoof, laying himself out as the sacrificial lamb while forcing the Government's hand. The Deputy Prime Minister believes that the establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority gives the rail industry the co-ordination it needs. Closer cooperation, not the nightmare of ripping up the present licensing system and trying to start again, is the answer, Prescott has told officials. The next day Corbett rowed back, saying that everything should be considered and that it was time for the industry to start speaking with one voice.</p> <p>Prescott inherited a railway structure hopelessly compromised by privatisation. It was a Conservative idea pushed through by a Conservative Government. The sound of Tories running away from the scene of the crime was heard all week.</p> <p>When the BBC's Today programme last week tried to contact previous Transport Secretaries involved in putting together the legislation, including Malcolm Rifkind and John MacGregor, they were mysteriously unavailable. Margaret Thatcher has said nothing.

He was advised by Sir Christopher Foster, then a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who was convinced that vertical separation - different owners for the trains and the track - was the way forward. The Tories wanted a number of rail companies to encourage competition, efficiency and 'local responsiveness'. Most importantly, having a lot of train-operating franchises would increase Treasury revenue by enabling a series of lucrative sell-offs rather than a single large one. The fines system would ensure, MacGregor hoped, that passengers got a good deal because trains would run on time. Safety was not the priority.</p> <p>Sir Bob Reid was chairman of British Rail until 1995, the key years when privatisation was pushed through. Reid said he warned MacGregor after the 1992 election that tearing up the structure of BR, which kept track ownership and train operations under one umbrella in geographical zones, would make running the railways 'very difficult'. Reid said he told the Government it had taken up to 30 years for oil operations in the North Sea to change to a system of contracting out many of its activities.</p> <p>'I had no objection to getting private money into the railways,' he said. 'But I told them if they were trying to make this huge change of responsibility at what seemed like 48 hours' notice, there was no way they would have the quality of operation BR had.

      "bodyText": "The drug factory at the centre of the polio vaccine scandal has a history of contamination and production blunders, leading to fears that its vaccines against other diseases are unsafe. The lives of thousands of old people and children have been put at risk by drug shortages caused by a catalogue of problems that have plagued the Medeva vaccines plant on Merseyside. One serious incident led to British soldiers being sent abroad without protection against Yellow Fever. Last year, investigators from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were horrified by the conditions they found at the plant in Speke, near Liverpool, which also makes vaccines against flu, tuberculosis, tetanus and Hepatitis B. On Friday, the Department of Health was forced to recall Medeva's oral polio vaccine after it was discovered that the firm had potentially been using BSE-infected material. This weekend, an investigation by The Observer can reveal that the problems surrounding the polio vaccine may prove to be the tip of the iceberg. A week-long inspection by the FDA last summer into the production of the flu vaccine Fluvirin at the plant found Medeva had failed to: \u0095 'clean, maintain and sanitise equipment at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunction or contamination'; \u0095 maintain systems to prevent unacceptable levels of toxins and bacteria contaminating the production process; \u0095 ensure batches of vaccines 'conformed with all established standards, specifications and characteristics'; and \u0095 prove that vaccines on doctors' shelves would be free from 'bacteria and fungi'. Last October the FDA's director of compliance, Steven Masiello, fired off an official warning letter to Medeva's head of primary production, John O'Brian, telling him to sort out the problems or have its product banned from entering the US. Fluvirin is used by some 20 million Americans and more than a million British people, many of them elderly. Although the extent of the excess levels of toxins and bacteria at the Speke factory is not known, in extreme cases, contaminated vaccines can lead to severe adverse reactions, including toxic shock and fever. In the old and fragile, the impact could be lethal. The FDA letter, seen by The Observer , contains the disclosure that instead of dealing with the problems, managers at the plant wanted to raise the level of contamination deemed to be acceptable. Sources familiar with the company's operations claim that there were serious production problems running through the factory and abuses were routinely ignored. Although it is not known what other contamination problems the factory had, it is known that production difficulties were not confined solely to the manufacture of the flu vaccine. The Observer has learned that the company was forced to stop making its Yellow Fever vaccine Arilvax, leading to a widespread shortage throughout the country. The Ministry of Defence last night confirmed that the situation became so serious that earlier this year it sent British soldiers on overseas missions without protection against Yellow Fever. Many travellers were also unable to get vaccinated against the horrifying tropical disease, which attacks the stomach and kidneys. The company has still not restarted production. This March, The Observer revealed that production problems at the Medeva factory had led to warnings of a tuberculosis epidemic after the company failed to supply sufficient quantities of vaccine to health authorities. Three months after the FDA inspection the shortage of TB vaccines led to the suspension of routine school vaccinations. Liberal Democrat consumer affairs spokesman Norman Baker is now calling for an immediate investigation into events at the Speke factory and a full explanation from the Department of Health. He also said that the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the body which regulates drug companies, had serious questions to answer about why it had failed to take any action. Baker said: 'The Department of Health and the MCA have completely failed to act in the interests of public health. 'In their desperate attempts not to undermine the vaccination programme, they have tried to sweep all problems under the carpet. As a result, public confidence has been shattered. 'When will they learn that the answer is not to cover up, but to identify problems and deal with them immediately?' The Medicines Control Agency refused to answer any questions posed by The Observer about Medeva's vaccines and production at the Merseyside factory. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'The MCA would not have allowed vaccines to be produced at this factory unless it was sure it was safe.'

      "body": "<p>The old Palestinian woman, her head wrapped in a scarf, scuttled from behind a corner and made a run for the barricade by Bethlehem's Rachel's Tomb - a flashpoint in three weeks of rioting. Ducking under a hail of stones and dodging Israeli sniper fire, she weaved among the stone-throwing youth of the shabab to bring bottled water to thirsty Palestinian boys on the frontline.</p> <p>Around the corner and out of sight, Palestinian taxis are ferrying in large chunks of rock from the surrounding hills. It is women, sitting together on the ground, who smash the rocks into ammunition for their husbands and sons.</p> <p>The images of the past three weeks have shown one side of the violence: a male world of confrontation on the streets, in the olive groves and the funeral crowds. As the media feeds these images to the world, the question arises: 'Where are the women?'</p> <p>In Jerusalem's Mokassed Islamic Charitable hospital, on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the Old City, Najah il Khatib, 42, is standing by her son's bedside. Zahran, 13, was participating in a riot that broke out in their village outside Jerusalem. 'We were sitting at home having lunch,' she says, 'when we got word that Israeli soldiers were surrounding our village. My son jumped up immediately from the table and ran out on to the street. I tried to block him as he went out the door but it was too late,' she sighs.</p> <p>The next time she saw her son he was in hospital. A high-velocity bullet bounced off a nearby rock and ricocheted to hit him in the chest.</p> <p>For Najah, her son is a hero. 'He's a fighter. If I could go out on the streets and demonstrate myself I would,' she says, 'but it's not my place. It's not in accordance with our religion. Girls just don't go out on the street like that with boys.'</p> <p>When riots break out in her village, the women stay inside with the younger children and gather around their satellite TVs to learn what is happening in the outside world.</p> <p>Further down the hospital corridor in the Intensive Care Unit, a 13-year-old boy Mohammed Jodah lies in bed motionless. A bullet fired by an Israeli soldier slammed into his brain and has left him completely paralysed in the right-hand side of his body. His mother, Miriam, 34, has no brave words to say. She is left, like so many women in this struggle, to pick up the shattered pieces of her loved ones' lives.</p> <p>'My children never participate in demonstrations,' she says. 'I don't allow them,' she says. But Miriam's son sneaked out of his house and went to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City. He was headed towards the most combustible, disputed 35-acre area known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Haram al Sharif to Muslims.</p> <p>'It was out of curiosity, perhaps, that he defied me and made the journey to the mosque that day,' Miriam says, 'but he is not the adventurous type.'</p> <p>Clashes broke out between the Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, and her son received a rubber-coated bullet in the head. To date the death of 12 minors - under the age of 17 - has been recorded in what is being called the Aqsa Intifada, the uprising of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p> <p>Israelis have accused Palestinian leaders of inciting violence at the mosques, and believe that textbooks have brainwashed Palestinian students with stories of martyrs who sacrifice themselves to kill Jews. But looking now at her son, his left eye rolling in its socket occasionally, Miriam has no desire to participate in or contribute to any struggle.</p> <p>'If any of my other children tried to go out on the street to demonstrate I'd try and stop them too,' she says. 'Sometimes they say it is be-cause God loves him that he takes my son and sometimes they say it is destiny. But my child is only 13 years old. Surely it is nobody's destiny to die like this.'</p> <p>In Nazareth, north of Jerusalem, Nabila Espagnoly, a 45-year-old Palestinian psychologist, believes the poor economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has kept traditional women in the home. 'Women are out there on the streets holding peaceful demonstrations, but \"peaceful demonstrations\" are not of any interest to the media. That is why you rarely see women activists on your television set. But the day a woman picks up stones, the world will sit up and notice.'</p> <p>Jewish women, right or left-wing, are no less active. But these groups continue to demonstrate in the shade, far away from the eye of the cameras. Peace activist Hana Safran, 50, is a PhD student at the Haifa University. She is also a member of 'Women in Black', a group, which, she says, promotes living in peace with its Arab neighbour.</p> <p>'We were protesting against the Israeli army and the manner in which it shoots at young Palestinian children,' Safran recalls, 'but the Israeli TV channels are not interested. They come to the scene, look at us, and then search desperately for something more dramatic to film. It looks like one must resort to violence to get the world's attention. But that would be tantamount to shooting ourselves in the foot, would it not?' she smiles.</p> <p>Demonstrating against the actions of the Israeli army means she is also challenging her son, who has enrolled in the army, which she finds very hard to bear. 'I told my son that I didn't bring him into this world to give him to any war - but now that he has joined I feel it is my responsibility, my moral duty, to share my political feelings with him.'</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The old Palestinian woman, her head wrapped in a scarf, scuttled from behind a corner and made a run for the barricade by Bethlehem's Rachel's Tomb - a flashpoint in three weeks of rioting. Ducking under a hail of stones and dodging Israeli sniper fire, she weaved among the stone-throwing youth of the shabab to bring bottled water to thirsty Palestinian boys on the frontline. Around the corner and out of sight, Palestinian taxis are ferrying in large chunks of rock from the surrounding hills. It is women, sitting together on the ground, who smash the rocks into ammunition for their husbands and sons. The images of the past three weeks have shown one side of the violence: a male world of confrontation on the streets, in the olive groves and the funeral crowds. As the media feeds these images to the world, the question arises: 'Where are the women?' In Jerusalem's Mokassed Islamic Charitable hospital, on the Mount of Olives, overlooking the Old City, Najah il Khatib, 42, is standing by her son's bedside. Zahran, 13, was participating in a riot that broke out in their village outside Jerusalem. 'We were sitting at home having lunch,' she says, 'when we got word that Israeli soldiers were surrounding our village. My son jumped up immediately from the table and ran out on to the street. I tried to block him as he went out the door but it was too late,' she sighs. The next time she saw her son he was in hospital. A high-velocity bullet bounced off a nearby rock and ricocheted to hit him in the chest. For Najah, her son is a hero. 'He's a fighter. If I could go out on the streets and demonstrate myself I would,' she says, 'but it's not my place. It's not in accordance with our religion. Girls just don't go out on the street like that with boys.' When riots break out in her village, the women stay inside with the younger children and gather around their satellite TVs to learn what is happening in the outside world. Further down the hospital corridor in the Intensive Care Unit, a 13-year-old boy Mohammed Jodah lies in bed motionless. A bullet fired by an Israeli soldier slammed into his brain and has left him completely paralysed in the right-hand side of his body. His mother, Miriam, 34, has no brave words to say. She is left, like so many women in this struggle, to pick up the shattered pieces of her loved ones' lives. 'My children never participate in demonstrations,' she says. 'I don't allow them,' she says. But Miriam's son sneaked out of his house and went to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City. He was headed towards the most combustible, disputed 35-acre area known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Haram al Sharif to Muslims. 'It was out of curiosity, perhaps, that he defied me and made the journey to the mosque that day,' Miriam says, 'but he is not the adventurous type.' Clashes broke out between the Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, and her son received a rubber-coated bullet in the head. To date the death of 12 minors - under the age of 17 - has been recorded in what is being called the Aqsa Intifada, the uprising of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Israelis have accused Palestinian leaders of inciting violence at the mosques, and believe that textbooks have brainwashed Palestinian students with stories of martyrs who sacrifice themselves to kill Jews. But looking now at her son, his left eye rolling in its socket occasionally, Miriam has no desire to participate in or contribute to any struggle. 'If any of my other children tried to go out on the street to demonstrate I'd try and stop them too,' she says. 'Sometimes they say it is be-cause God loves him that he takes my son and sometimes they say it is destiny. But my child is only 13 years old. Surely it is nobody's destiny to die like this.' In Nazareth, north of Jerusalem, Nabila Espagnoly, a 45-year-old Palestinian psychologist, believes the poor economic situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has kept traditional women in the home. 'Women are out there on the streets holding peaceful demonstrations, but \"peaceful demonstrations\" are not of any interest to the media. That is why you rarely see women activists on your television set. But the day a woman picks up stones, the world will sit up and notice.' Jewish women, right or left-wing, are no less active. But these groups continue to demonstrate in the shade, far away from the eye of the cameras. Peace activist Hana Safran, 50, is a PhD student at the Haifa University. She is also a member of 'Women in Black', a group, which, she says, promotes living in peace with its Arab neighbour. 'We were protesting against the Israeli army and the manner in which it shoots at young Palestinian children,' Safran recalls, 'but the Israeli TV channels are not interested. They come to the scene, look at us, and then search desperately for something more dramatic to film. It looks like one must resort to violence to get the world's attention. But that would be tantamount to shooting ourselves in the foot, would it not?' she smiles. Demonstrating against the actions of the Israeli army means she is also challenging her son, who has enrolled in the army, which she finds very hard to bear. 'I told my son that I didn't bring him into this world to give him to any war - but now that he has joined I feel it is my responsibility, my moral duty, to share my political feelings with him.'

      "body": "<p>Last autumn, one of my neighbours, Kenneth Payne, fortified by the courage available at one of our local bars, loaded his shotgun, walked across the road to the trailer home of best buddy Curtis Cook and emptied both barrels into Cook's stomach. </p> <p>While his friend bled to death, Kenneth sat down on his porch and telephoned a local family to say 'no one's going to bother your little girl anymore'. Kenneth claimed that Curtis had, earlier in the evening, confessed to molesting the neighbour's eight-year-old child.</p> <p>The next day, our town's burghers ran out to tell curious metropolitan reporters 'things like that don't happen here'. Really? No local mentioned the story of our school headmaster's daughter, who hid her pregnancy from her parents then drowned her child right after it's birth.</p> <p>What kind of monstrous hamlet do I live in? While few Americans have heard of it, you probably know it as the congenial, rural town lionised on BBC radio's Letter from America, broadcast by Alistair Cooke, one of our few unarmed residents.</p> <p>Like Alistair, I have made shameless use of the cartoon imagery of this convenient exemplar of unspoilt small town America. A few months ago, I wrote of our town's heroic struggle to block McDonald's opening a restaurant, a threat to our quaint rural character. The way I told it, we were gloriously defeated by the McLawyers who bullied us into bending our preservation laws.</p> <p>I left out of the story the fact that our defence was sabotaged from within by some members of that fifth column of small businessmen found in every American town - the local real estate agents, shopkeepers and farmers who hoped to turn a quick buck on their properties once the planning rules were breached and broken.</p> <p>I've written scores of bad-tempered columns about the brutish ways of America's biggest businesses. That viewpoint is admittedly a bit unbalanced. To be fair, we must recognise that for sheer narrow-minded, corrosive greed nothing can beat the USA's grasping, whingeing small businessmen. </p> <p>And within that avaricious little pack, none are so poisonously self-centred and incorrigible as the small town businessmen of rural America.</p> <p>During the presidential debates, Al Gore opened the bidding to win this pampered demographic by promising to slash inheritance taxes 'to save our family farms and businesses'.

      "bodyText": "Last autumn, one of my neighbours, Kenneth Payne, fortified by the courage available at one of our local bars, loaded his shotgun, walked across the road to the trailer home of best buddy Curtis Cook and emptied both barrels into Cook's stomach. While his friend bled to death, Kenneth sat down on his porch and telephoned a local family to say 'no one's going to bother your little girl anymore'. Kenneth claimed that Curtis had, earlier in the evening, confessed to molesting the neighbour's eight-year-old child. The next day, our town's burghers ran out to tell curious metropolitan reporters 'things like that don't happen here'. Really? No local mentioned the story of our school headmaster's daughter, who hid her pregnancy from her parents then drowned her child right after it's birth. What kind of monstrous hamlet do I live in? While few Americans have heard of it, you probably know it as the congenial, rural town lionised on BBC radio's Letter from America, broadcast by Alistair Cooke, one of our few unarmed residents. Like Alistair, I have made shameless use of the cartoon imagery of this convenient exemplar of unspoilt small town America. A few months ago, I wrote of our town's heroic struggle to block McDonald's opening a restaurant, a threat to our quaint rural character. The way I told it, we were gloriously defeated by the McLawyers who bullied us into bending our preservation laws. I left out of the story the fact that our defence was sabotaged from within by some members of that fifth column of small businessmen found in every American town - the local real estate agents, shopkeepers and farmers who hoped to turn a quick buck on their properties once the planning rules were breached and broken. I've written scores of bad-tempered columns about the brutish ways of America's biggest businesses. That viewpoint is admittedly a bit unbalanced. To be fair, we must recognise that for sheer narrow-minded, corrosive greed nothing can beat the USA's grasping, whingeing small businessmen. And within that avaricious little pack, none are so poisonously self-centred and incorrigible as the small town businessmen of rural America. During the presidential debates, Al Gore opened the bidding to win this pampered demographic by promising to slash inheritance taxes 'to save our family farms and businesses'. Right now, if you inherit a farm or business worth up to $2.6 million (\u00a31.8 million) you pay no tax at all. But that's just not enough for what the fawning candidates call 'local entrepreneurs'. Gore promised to raise the exemption to $4 million - only to be trumped by George W Bush, who would wipe away inheritance taxes altogether. This group is the same that defeated Bill and Hillary Clinton's 1993 proposal to require all businesses to provide bare-bones health insurance for their employees, an expenditure of only 35 cents (23p) per hour. Fortune 500 corporations expressed few qualms about the mandatory insurance plan as most big firms already provide some health care coverage for their employees. It was the swarm of Lilliputian entrepreneurs, under the aegis of their National Federation of Independent Businesses, who blocked the Clintons' modest attempt to end medical care apartheid in America. You name it - maternity leave, minimum wage, even health and safety inspections and rules barring racism in hiring - any meagre proposal to protect the lives and families of working people, and the NFIB's small businesses legions have their swords out. But we must never say so. Gore can shoot at big tobacco and big oil, Bush can vilify teachers and union workers, but any politician who breathes a word against rural businesses, farmers or the NFIB's Scrooge battalions ends up as electoral roadkill. Ten years ago, our town convinced a charitable foundation to pay for experts from Britain to tell us how to preserve our area's rural character. We held meetings, referenda, elections. It was that active small town American democracy that makes the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland ga-ga with envy. At the end, the town voted overwhelmingly to adopt what became known as the UK Stewardship Plan to protect our green fields and prevent ugly sprawl. Come by my town today and count the pustules of strip malls and fluorescent signs directing you to Bagels Hot, Cars Like New No Down-Payment, and Dog Burger where corn fields once stood. Sensible British designs and a preservation-minded electorate could not overcome the me-first obstructionism of a hard core of small businessmen and farmers lusting to sell off their land to McDonald's, Wal-Mart and housing speculators. I wouldn't equate rural shotgun murders and child molesting with the small town businessman's penchant for despoiling the rural landscape. But they are covered over by the same cowardly silence. No politician, local or national, has the guts to break though the mythology of the struggling local businessman who cares and sacrifices for his community. This folkloric invention approaches saintliness when the discussion turns to rural, small town America with its treacly images of barbershop quartets, Farmer Brown on his tractor and the Main Street parade after the strawberry harvest. What makes challenging this myth of happy small-town America off-limits is that it provides pleasant code words for the ugliest corner of the American psyche. When politicians talk about 'small-town American values', 'family values' and the 'hard-working small businessman' everyone knows the colour of that town, that family and that businessman: white. Pleasantville USA is implicitly placed against the urban jungle populated at the bottom by dark-skinned muggers and pregnant teenagers on the dole, and at the top by Jewish financiers of Hollywood pornography. It would dangerously undermine this politically useful imagery if the public were reminded that small towns are filled with pale-faced citizens despairing and dangerous as any in the inner cities. Nor could the NFIB win those special exemptions from taxes and planning regulations for small business and farms if they were not seen as struggling defenders of local communities but dollar-crazed and duplicitous operators who wouldn't care if McDonald's put a drive-though in the Lincoln Memorial. Britain is not exempt from the political bullying power of small-town commercial cliques. It was sick-making to read of the Department of Environment's proposal to remove 80 per cent of England and Wales from the Areas of Special Control of Advertising which, until now, protected the countryside from billboards. This is the first step in the Government's loosening of rural planning strictures. The DETR's advisory quango, the Countryside Agency, last week dismissed preservationists fears as 'a nostalgic yearning for a countryside that is long gone.

But the decision to pull out of the Netherlands this year, albeit for sound reasons, which have no impact on its plans for expanding in the Far East, has knocked the credibility of its overseas strategy. Besides, it is likely to be loss-making for at least three years. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Halfords is doing nicely, but there is a limit to how much its bikes and car-parts business can be expanded. And the optician chain is doing well to hold its own in a fiercely competitive market. Which leaves Boots Healthcare International. </p> <p>It is a good business: profits have jumped from just \u00a31 million in 1998 to \u00a325m in the year to last March as it found ever more innovative ways of packaging its Nurofen painkiller and the E45 skincare range. As the division's title suggests, it is the most international of Boots' businesses. More than three-quarters of its sales are overseas, thanks to additions to its skincare range such as Lutsine in France and Hermal in Germany, and to its success in establishing Nurofen as the Continent's fastest-growing over-the-counter painkiller. </p> <p>Boots has made no secret of its desire to find new products for the division, and there are likely to be more deals to follow last week's purchase of Clearasil, the skincare range, from Procter &amp; Gamble. The $340m (\u00a3233m) price seems a bit steep for a mature business, with annual sales of $137m, but it was well down P&amp;G's priority list. Backed with a bit of Boots' marketing muscle, it should not be hard to increase sales - indeed, Boots is so confident about this, it is promising the deal will improve earn-ings in the first full year of ownership. </p> <p>However, Boots is interested not just in the product but in what it will add to the rest of the business. Unlike its other skincare products, which can only be sold through licensed pharmacies in Europe, Clearasil is available in department stores and supermarkets. </p> <p>Boots is already working on a range of skincare products that will be sold through these channels, and Clearasil will give them a useful introduction. It could also help Boots enter the US market, which accounts for 40 per cent of Clearasil's business. </p> <p>On its own, however, the acquisition is not enough to convince investors that Boots can transform itself into a fast-growing company. In-deed, in the short-term, the share price could suffer a bout of depression. </p> <p>Boots has been gradually phasing out what it calls 'leisure' ranges - kettles, gifts and the like - which were making only a minimal contribution to profit. Sales of these are strongest in the run-up to Christmas and their loss will make like-for-like sales growth look weak, although profits should be stronger. </p> <p>The shares have fallen almost a quarter this year and, on most conventional measures, look cheap. But they are unlikely to go anywhere at least until the in-terim results, due next month, so there is no compelling reason to buy now. </p> <p><strong> Race to the finish</strong><br> </p> <p>Are mobile phones the computers of the future? A lot of investors - not to mention bankers - are betting heavily on it.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to the aftermath of the old economy. In the race between Europe's new 'just-in-time, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week' super-states, we are in danger of losing our ability to manage the expectations of an increasingly wired society. Technology can help fulfil our ambitions, but it doesn't do much for people who can't afford ambition. </p> <p>A warning comes from the heart of the internet revolution, the US. A Gartner Group report has found that a whole generation of up to 50 million Americans could become 'functionally illiterate' in the future due to a lack of knowledge of, or access to, the internet. </p> <p>Gartner found that just 35 per cent of adults in the lower-socio-economic-status bracket had internet access, compared with 53 per cent in the lower-middle, 79 per cent in the upper-middle, and 83 per cent in the top bracket. </p> <p>The report identified three digital divides: access to the internet; a skills gap between those who know how to benefit from the internet and those who don't; and speed of access to the internet. </p> <p>As the posturing over cheap, unmetered internet access continues, and the availability of broadband (ADSL &amp; cable) increases, a danger exists that this third divide - between those with high-speed access and those without - may leave non-metropolitan areas disadvantaged. </p> <p>In many respects this threat mirrors the socio-economic gaps in PC ownership today and raises the unacceptable prospect of second-class access to the information super-highway. In Brit-ain, where a quarter of homes are believed to have access to the internet, one can sit comfortably inside the well-connected embrace of the M25 and imagine the benefits of the new dot-communism reaching equally in all directions. But look less than a hundred miles into the South East, as far as Margate perhaps, and the gap between new- and old-economy imagination and aspiration starts to resemble a chasm. </p> <p>Where does one draw the line between one industrial era and another? Is the criterion for an advanced information society really as simple as counting the number of electronic messages that pass between individuals and companies? According to the latest government-sponsored survey, 27 per cent of UK businesses are now using the internet. Scotland leads, with 29 per cent of companies trading online. But compare these figures with private-sector research. Although Ministers claim that the UK is on a par with Germany, the US and Sweden, PricewaterhouseCoopers recently announced that Germany was leading Europe in online transactions. </p> <p>Uncomfortable facts of early twenty-first century life are that we live in a time of profound and complex change in a global economy constantly pursuing the highest profits and lowest transaction costs and that the remains of our manufacturing base is increasingly moving overseas. Unskilled Indonesians may pack processors for a few dollars a day, but a skilled European information worker can command more than \u00a350,000 a year. Between these two extremes, and in every industrial society, there are populations who are too poor and unskilled to share in the new affluence; whose opportunities are increasingly restricted by economic and political forces outside their control. </p> <p>Throughout Europe, governments are anticipating a long-term devastation of the retail and public sector workforce caused by 'disintermediation': the elimination of the middleman by the arrival of the 'just-in-time' forces of information and communications technology (ICT). But the forces of progress carry the seeds of their own acute skills crisis. No single nation has a large enough pool of information-literate workers available to sustain the rapid growth in the global networked economy. </p> <p>The Institute of Directors has 50,000 members from across the old and new economy spectrum. For many, commercial ambition is increasingly constrained by the people factor. While optimism remains high, ICT employment costs are spiralling, and in the absence of a silicon-savvy workforce any vision of economic utopia appears increasingly distant. Understandably, Professor Jim Norton, the IoD's director of e-business development, believes human capital is our ultimate resource. 'Bridging the digital divide and enfranchising all of our population in the e-economy must be the Government's top priority,' he says. </p> <p>In the race to wire UK society into the internet, the Government has a vision, a budget and an initiative. The UK Online project, directed by Department for Education and Employment Minister Michael Wills, has set itself the ambitious target of full digital emancipation within five years. A new research centre is to be created to investigate the impact of new technology and will lead the efforts to end the so-called digital divide before it becomes a problem of acute social exclusion. </p> <p>Facing the prospect of a lost generation, how do governments plan to re-engineer the workforce to meet the demands of a global networked economy? </p> <p>Wills sees the UK Online project meeting the challenge, with two core priorities. 'First, the internet revolution isn't happening for everyone. Every person has the right to access and participate in these technologies. Second, we need to make sure that we have the right skills base. Alongside this comes another range of priorities; the right use of ICT in schools and communities. In the medium to long term, we have to close the skills gap in society. In the short term, and like every OECD country, we have a shortage of people with the right skills, and we have to tackle this head on and in a variety of ways.' </p> <p>In Wills' opinion: the principal challenges that governments need to address urgently are hardware, software and connectivity. 'The danger of a \"third-divide\" appearing is enormously important, which is why we are encouraging the widest kind of competition from telecommunications carriers. While we have a quite well developed cable industry, government needs to immediately target the danger of rural deprivation, and we wish to find innovative ways of reaching disadvantage and deprivation. The truth is that in 20 years we will have got there - but we have to get there quicker than that.' </p> <p>While nobody would doubt that the Prime Minister's own commitmentto rapid action, investment and education are a vital first step in devising a strategy to address a growing skills deficit, there is a harsher macro-economic big picture to consider. Do we in Europe have, like the Americans, a lost generation of our own, a thirtysomething workforce intel lectually and emotionally unprepared for the changes and challenges ahead? </p> <p>The new 'knowledge economy' will be a harsh environment for the common man. While a universal grasp of and access to ICT will emancipate more people in the device space of the web, one must question whether UK Online can deliver a central part of its vision in time. Can it swiftly produce the army of skilled and educated experts required to run tomorrow's new economy today?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the aftermath of the old economy. In the race between Europe's new 'just-in-time, 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week' super-states, we are in danger of losing our ability to manage the expectations of an increasingly wired society. Technology can help fulfil our ambitions, but it doesn't do much for people who can't afford ambition. A warning comes from the heart of the internet revolution, the US. A Gartner Group report has found that a whole generation of up to 50 million Americans could become 'functionally illiterate' in the future due to a lack of knowledge of, or access to, the internet. Gartner found that just 35 per cent of adults in the lower-socio-economic-status bracket had internet access, compared with 53 per cent in the lower-middle, 79 per cent in the upper-middle, and 83 per cent in the top bracket. The report identified three digital divides: access to the internet; a skills gap between those who know how to benefit from the internet and those who don't; and speed of access to the internet. As the posturing over cheap, unmetered internet access continues, and the availability of broadband (ADSL &amp; cable) increases, a danger exists that this third divide - between those with high-speed access and those without - may leave non-metropolitan areas disadvantaged. In many respects this threat mirrors the socio-economic gaps in PC ownership today and raises the unacceptable prospect of second-class access to the information super-highway. In Brit-ain, where a quarter of homes are believed to have access to the internet, one can sit comfortably inside the well-connected embrace of the M25 and imagine the benefits of the new dot-communism reaching equally in all directions. But look less than a hundred miles into the South East, as far as Margate perhaps, and the gap between new- and old-economy imagination and aspiration starts to resemble a chasm. Where does one draw the line between one industrial era and another? Is the criterion for an advanced information society really as simple as counting the number of electronic messages that pass between individuals and companies? According to the latest government-sponsored survey, 27 per cent of UK businesses are now using the internet. Scotland leads, with 29 per cent of companies trading online. But compare these figures with private-sector research. Although Ministers claim that the UK is on a par with Germany, the US and Sweden, PricewaterhouseCoopers recently announced that Germany was leading Europe in online transactions. Uncomfortable facts of early twenty-first century life are that we live in a time of profound and complex change in a global economy constantly pursuing the highest profits and lowest transaction costs and that the remains of our manufacturing base is increasingly moving overseas. Unskilled Indonesians may pack processors for a few dollars a day, but a skilled European information worker can command more than \u00a350,000 a year. Between these two extremes, and in every industrial society, there are populations who are too poor and unskilled to share in the new affluence; whose opportunities are increasingly restricted by economic and political forces outside their control. Throughout Europe, governments are anticipating a long-term devastation of the retail and public sector workforce caused by 'disintermediation': the elimination of the middleman by the arrival of the 'just-in-time' forces of information and communications technology (ICT). But the forces of progress carry the seeds of their own acute skills crisis. No single nation has a large enough pool of information-literate workers available to sustain the rapid growth in the global networked economy. The Institute of Directors has 50,000 members from across the old and new economy spectrum. For many, commercial ambition is increasingly constrained by the people factor. While optimism remains high, ICT employment costs are spiralling, and in the absence of a silicon-savvy workforce any vision of economic utopia appears increasingly distant. Understandably, Professor Jim Norton, the IoD's director of e-business development, believes human capital is our ultimate resource. 'Bridging the digital divide and enfranchising all of our population in the e-economy must be the Government's top priority,' he says. In the race to wire UK society into the internet, the Government has a vision, a budget and an initiative. The UK Online project, directed by Department for Education and Employment Minister Michael Wills, has set itself the ambitious target of full digital emancipation within five years. A new research centre is to be created to investigate the impact of new technology and will lead the efforts to end the so-called digital divide before it becomes a problem of acute social exclusion. Facing the prospect of a lost generation, how do governments plan to re-engineer the workforce to meet the demands of a global networked economy? Wills sees the UK Online project meeting the challenge, with two core priorities. 'First, the internet revolution isn't happening for everyone. Every person has the right to access and participate in these technologies. Second, we need to make sure that we have the right skills base. Alongside this comes another range of priorities; the right use of ICT in schools and communities. In the medium to long term, we have to close the skills gap in society. In the short term, and like every OECD country, we have a shortage of people with the right skills, and we have to tackle this head on and in a variety of ways.' In Wills' opinion: the principal challenges that governments need to address urgently are hardware, software and connectivity. 'The danger of a \"third-divide\" appearing is enormously important, which is why we are encouraging the widest kind of competition from telecommunications carriers. While we have a quite well developed cable industry, government needs to immediately target the danger of rural deprivation, and we wish to find innovative ways of reaching disadvantage and deprivation. The truth is that in 20 years we will have got there - but we have to get there quicker than that.' While nobody would doubt that the Prime Minister's own commitmentto rapid action, investment and education are a vital first step in devising a strategy to address a growing skills deficit, there is a harsher macro-economic big picture to consider. Do we in Europe have, like the Americans, a lost generation of our own, a thirtysomething workforce intel lectually and emotionally unprepared for the changes and challenges ahead? The new 'knowledge economy' will be a harsh environment for the common man. While a universal grasp of and access to ICT will emancipate more people in the device space of the web, one must question whether UK Online can deliver a central part of its vision in time. Can it swiftly produce the army of skilled and educated experts required to run tomorrow's new economy today?",

      "body": "<p>Times are good. Unemployment is at a historically low level, interest rates look to be at, or near, their peak and even the housing market seems to be in equilibrium. Most telling of all perhaps is the amount we are running up on tick; personal debt stands at \u00a310,000, on average, for every adult in the country. </p> <p>While this is not a problem for the moment, many of us would be feeling uncomfortable in an economic downturn. The Government's decision to hold a debt 'summit' at the end of this month, summoning lending institutions to discuss how consumers might be protected from over-borrowing, is well timed. So too is the campaign, due to start before Christmas, from the Office of Fair Trading, warning young people of the hazards of too much debt. </p> <p>The credit industry can point to competition in its business so intense that it has never been cheaper to borrow on a credit card. But neither has it ever been more difficult to work out how all the various deals work. The concern of debt counsellors is that too many people really do not understand what they are taking on when they rack up a big credit card bill.

      "bodyText": "Times are good. Unemployment is at a historically low level, interest rates look to be at, or near, their peak and even the housing market seems to be in equilibrium. Most telling of all perhaps is the amount we are running up on tick; personal debt stands at \u00a310,000, on average, for every adult in the country. While this is not a problem for the moment, many of us would be feeling uncomfortable in an economic downturn. The Government's decision to hold a debt 'summit' at the end of this month, summoning lending institutions to discuss how consumers might be protected from over-borrowing, is well timed. So too is the campaign, due to start before Christmas, from the Office of Fair Trading, warning young people of the hazards of too much debt. The credit industry can point to competition in its business so intense that it has never been cheaper to borrow on a credit card. But neither has it ever been more difficult to work out how all the various deals work. The concern of debt counsellors is that too many people really do not understand what they are taking on when they rack up a big credit card bill. Others fancy themselves as financial sophisticates by surfing from one 'cheap' debt transfer deal to another without ever paying off their debts. Sue Edwards, a policy officer at the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, whose advice centres pick up the pieces when individuals get into trouble with debt, is almost certainly right when she says that credit is probably feeding the relative buoyancy of the economy and borrowing is being used as a form of income. The Government is expected to examine whether lenders need to be more efficient in their use of 'white' information about credit applicants.

      "body": "<p>For a man who has seen his company's value slide by nearly $40 billion in six months, Tim Koogle is looking remarkably calm. In fact, he looks more than calm. The Yahoo! president and chief executive officer seems positively joyous. </p> <p>Sitting in the study of the Dean's house at the London Business School, just before he addresses some future masters of the universe, Koogle shows no outward sign that he is a man who believes Silicon Valley will soon be renamed Death Valley due to the recent bloodbath in the dotcom sector. </p> <p>Perhaps it is because Koogle believes he is blessed with what he calls the gift of 'serendipity'. 'I've been making money since I was very young. As I look back over four decades of making money the huge value for me in doing that from such an early age is that it has put me in the shoes of my customers and I've got enough perspective to have a pretty accurate view of real consumers. I find a lot of joy in serving up great product and the one thing that drives people's consumption patterns is serendipity.' And serendipity is? The faculty of making fortunate discoveries by accident. Hmm. </p> <p>Before the age of 10, Koogle was a precocious travelling salesman, knocking on his neighbours' doors offering gardening services. As a teenager he worked for one R McDonald, making sure that burger equipment in one of the grinning clown's franchises worked properly. By his forties he had become president of Intermec Corp, a Seattle-based data collection firm. Before that there was a nine-year spell with Motorola in a number of executive positions. </p> <p>Koogle's talk of serendipity might make some of the older heads at the London Business School a little bemused. It conjures up pictures of shareholders looking nervously at each other and asking: 'So this serendipity thing, where d'ya get it and what's it doing to the bottom line?' The answer is a) you either have it or you don't, and b) a great deal. Yahoo! has grown from a company valued at $4 million in 1995 to one which, before the bubble burst, was worth nearly $70bn. </p> <p>The massive surge in the company's value has been largely predicated on the fact that Yahoo! seems to have found a way of linking the separate worlds of media, e-commerce and services like email to create a virtuous circle for the new economy. </p> <p>'We've always been very clear and focused. We have always been open, comprehensive aggregators of world- class content and services. We know that consumption patterns get driven by serendipity. People bump into things that they wouldn't have predicted they wanted.' </p> <p>This might seem a nebulous concept to follow, but Koogle is convinced the approach will work. He argues that the old media distribution methods - such as cable or radio - are no longer where real value lies. </p> <p>'On the internet, no one company controls physical distribution. Anyone with access to internet can access any site - independent of their or its location. So on a slightly philosophical level, the distribution asset begins to be the relationship that is formed between a service and its end users.' And that's where Yahoo! comes in. </p> <p>Koogle, funny and warm with more than a hint of West Coast philosophy professor about him, says this was always the company's intention. 'Even back as early as 1995 we had a vision that we wanted to create a global branded network. It's not just navigation - we're more than a portal. We have many, many services and hosted content throughout the network. We're integrating deeper and deeper within content, commerce, delivery and services across our network. In a very straightforward way, we are a distribution platform for many great providers.' </p> <p>But the danger is that distribution is not where the real value lies - instead, it belongs to the content providers, those firms who in the future will produce the media we will all want to consume. </p> <p>Certainly AOL, in the middle of trying to merge with media giant Time Warner, believes this to be the case. And, in addition to the AOL deal, search engine Excite was taken over by cable operator At Home, while Lycos has married Latin lover Terra Networks, of which Spanish telecoms and media company Telef\u00f3nica is the majority owner. </p> <p>So would Koogle consider a similar sort of deal? 'Not at this time. We of course have considered it. We've had lots of discussions with lots of companies worldwide, some of which are quite large franchises in traditional media. We're very respectful of Time Warner and AOL. We think they're great businesses and great competitors. There's no doubt if they get their merger completed they'll have some kind of financial clout and flexibility but we're believers in the open model. Great content always seeks out great distribution in the history of media. There's great business to be had without owning each other.' However, it is clear Koogle is looking at forging numerous content alliances. 'There are interesting specialised content partnerships that we will be continuing to build and evolve. I think in those kinds of cases there are great content suppliers that see huge value in our distribution, but I don't think we need to own each other. Our goal of being very large and maintaining our size in terms of audience breadth is better-served by being independent.' </p> <p>A merger with a big old media company would go against everything Yahoo! stands for. Set up by two twentysomething Stanford graduates, Jerry Young and David Filo, in 1994, Yahoo! still retains something of a campus mentality. Koogle, who was headhunted the following year, is known to all as TK. Ties are, of course, effectively banned. Hawaiian shirts, of which Koogle owns a particularly ferocious collection, are de rigeur . </p> <p>'We have this really free approach to Yahoo! We all share that same philosophy. You can deliver real joy to customers worldwide if you give them the ability to discover things they otherwise would not have predicted. That's about serendipity itself.' </p> <p>There he goes using that 's' word again. But Wall Street seems less sure about its long- term viability these days. The company is now worth a notch above $30bn. Admittedly this still values Yahoo! at a vertiginous 150 times earnings, but Koogle says the company is now undervalued because analysts are looking too short- term. 'The way we run the business is for the long term. We've built it on great fundamentals. There have been very few companies that have grown to this scale and profitability so quickly.' </p> <p>Hang on. Did he say profitability? The 'p' word is not usually found in the same sentence as the words 'internet company', but Yahoo! is something of an exception. Analysts are pencilling in profits of nearly $280m for the year. Earlier this month the company beat all forecasts to ratchet up third-quarter sales of nearly $300m. </p> <p>Unfortunately, it also had to confess to the fact that it had lost more than 200 online advertisers over the period - a huge worry for analysts, who fear that the company's business model, which depends partly on advertising revenues, could be in jeopardy. Koogle points out that Yahoo! is becoming less and less reliant on dotcom firms for advertising revenue. </p> <p>He says he saw the shakeout coming although he did not think it would be so dramatic. 'I knew we were going to have a correction. It was difficult to predict when. There were valuations that had gotten a little bit out of the range of normalcy. And everyone knew that. I've been a little bit surprised by the speed.' </p> <p>But Koogle argues that the correction now means Yahoo! is in a strong position. 'The concept is to find strategic ways that we can extend our business through acqui sition. The opportunities for us are broader right now because the capital markets are less friendly to early-stage companies.' </p> <p>Serendipity strikes again. </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> Tim Koogle </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 49 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> President and chief executive </p> <p><strong> Other directorships: </strong> Non-executive of Web Van and E-Loan </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Guitars, cars</p>",

We move into a scruffy room with hardly anything in it but a camp bed and a cooker and a tin of Ronseal. I am determined not to look at the caption but luckily there's an exciting film being shown behind the wall containing scenes that some people might find disturbing, notably a distressed young man sitting on the same camp bed in the same room being ranted at by another young man. Are they lovers? Does angry man A want to know why distressed man B is still in his pyjamas in the middle of the day, or are they impoverished drama students and the one flatmate is throwing a hissy because the other has eaten the last of the Ronseal? It is only a matter of time before one of them sticks his head in the oven only to find that neither of them has paid the gas bill, but I am afraid they're taking too long about it for my taste. Meanwhile, there are thoughtful things to be pondered: a rubbish tip that I think may have transferred from Tate Modern, two rather smart bus shelters from Auschwitz, a sexually explicit video (which proves to be amazingly popular), and the main attraction - millions of little plastic Nazis in glass showcases with their bowels hanging out, stringing each other up and shagging skeletons and shovelling bodies into pits, which is quite horrible. I'm sorry but I don't buy this idea that we can no longer be shocked by man's inhumanity to man, despite the large number of Airfix aficionados milling round marvelling at the detail. Afterwards I fly across town to meet further chums with the aim of spending hours finding a pub showing England v Finland, which is being broadcast on a secret channel that you have to pay for. 'How can a country that spends half the year in total darkness be any good at football?' asks Stephanie, thereby throwing an instant curse on our own plucky side, who crash to a nil-nil defeat. OK, not the end of the world. But then we haven't played Albania yet. phil.hogan@observer.co.uk",

To their credit, both these people were honest about their price tags, past and present. A year ago, at 19, Way, an internet high-flyer, was offered a multi-million pound contract to develop a new search engine. The drawback was that he was also required to sign away his right to drink, stay out late and dress outlandishly.

To which Foster replied 'It's a very good quote', and made it the title of a best-selling book on one of the great financial follies of the 1980s. </p> <p>The Times journalists who interviewed the president of the European Central Bank last week got a remarkable reply to the question whether it would make sense for central banks to get into the market if a sharp change in currencies were caused by war in the Middle East: 'I wouldn't think so,' was the quote. </p> <p>Duisenberg has a first-class press adviser, Manfred Korber, who spent many years at the Bundesbank and knows all about the sensitivities of the financial markets. As the Times reported: 'His press adviser, acutely aware of the potential market significance of the president's remarks on intervention, asked Duisenberg if he was happy for these comments to remain on the record. The ECB president replied that he was.' </p> <p>Then, of course, all hell broke loose. The financial markets had been impressed by last month's intervention by the Group of Seven leading industrial countries to prop up the euro, and were waiting for more. The September intervention may not have sent the euro shooting up for long, but it steadied the currency. The fact that the G7 had shown they were prepared to intervene undoubtedly improved the climate around the euro. </p> <p>The ECB president was widely criticised for having broken the code under which central bank governors do not answer questions about intervention policy. In my experience, however, they, and finance ministers, do so when it suits them. The real gaffe was to give the impression that that was that - no more intervention on the cards. </p> <p>Despite the embarrassment he has caused, Duisenberg is the best ECB president we have; it is generally thought that his obvious - indeed designated - successor, Jean-Claude Trichet, will not step into his shoes before the euro notes and coins are introduced in 2002. </p> <p>At a press conference last Thursday the ECB closed ranks and Duisenberg teasingly conceded, when asked to resign, that he had accepted advice 'and I am not going to answer any questions related to that recent interview'.

Way back in January the G7 discussed intervention, but only Japan was keen. At the April G7 meeting the French and the Italians wanted a statement about intervention but the Germans didn't. Japan is believed to have intervened heavily this year to prevent the yen from appreciating further against the dollar, and with some success. It was only in September that the Europeans could agree on the need for intervention. Then, having impressed the markets and got them on tenterhooks (which always helps against speculative fever), the ECB president nearly ruined it. </p> <p>These are sensitive times, and the markets are prepared to make mountains of molehills. There was a widespread assumption that the US Federal Reserve would not intervene in the markets before the 7 November presidential election, but it did. The Fed was keener on intervention than the US Treasury, and can advise it on the need for intervention, but takes its final instructions from the Treasury. A little-noticed item in the Times interview was Duisenberg's remark that the market was 'decidedly wrong' if its impression was that the US intervention had been 'very modest'. </p> <p>The market is also obsessed by statements by US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers that he favours a strong dollar. Certainly, Summers favours a strong dollar. But I doubt whether he favours the collapse of US multinational business in Europe, or would stand idly by if the euro looked like going into a freefall precipitated either by a Middle East war or by some other financial panic. </p> <p>As the FT 's excellent market reports observed: 'Mr Summers trod a fine line [after Duisenberg's gaffe] reiterating his support for the long-standing strong dollar policy while saying he shared concerns over the euro.' And one of the Fed governors, Robert Parry, said the strong dollar was 'denting corporate profitability and exports'. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the world economy is finely poised, and nothing can be ruled out on the G7 front. For the moment, the central bankers - from Alan Greenspan to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee - give the impression that there is no panic on the inflation front from higher oil prices, provided they don't go much higher, and provided wage bargainers do not respond with inflationary wage claims. </p> <p>But this relative optimism could change, and my own impression is that last week's reassuring speech by Greenspan was - given the US trade deficit, the vulnerability of Wall Street and the unknowns in the oil market - at the upper end of complacency for a central bank governor. </p> <p>My final thought for those who think currency intervention is out of the question is a reminder of what Margaret Thatcher did in January 1985 when the pound threatened to fall to $1. She simply changed her non-intervention policy and rang up her friend Ronald Reagan to ask for his help as well. </p> <p>Of course, the nice thing about intervention is that, in the end, finance ministries and central banks can do it with other people's money.

      "body": "<p>It is one of the most surreal yet symbolic scenes of the post-war Balkans. Every night a faint glow can be seen through the windows of the great, unfinished Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the centre of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.</p> <p>But the gentle light comes not from candles, ghosts or angels. Inside the church is a large tent. And inside the tent are three Royal Marines commandos. If you come at the right time, they will all be sitting on their sofa clutching mugs of tea and watching EastEnders. A fourth will be outside keeping guard, making sure the church is not razed by Kosovo's Albanians who see it as a symbol of a past and a people they hate.</p> <p>Three weeks after Slobodan Milosevic fell from power, and a week before Kosovo's Albanians cast their votes in their first internationally supervised free election, everything and nothing has changed here. While there is little doubt British troops will be watching EastEnders and protecting Kosovo's Serbian churches and churchgoers for years to come, it is also clear the events in Belgrade have altered the political landscape.</p> <p>Sixteen months ago, at the end of the Kosovo war, as 850,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees streamed home in the wake of Nato's victory, Kosovo's independence seemed imminent. But, now, with the rehabilitation of Serbia's image at the fall of Milosevic, the international community's sympathy for Kosovo's Albanians is over.</p> <p>Their leaders were dismayed at Milosevic's fall. Hashim Thaci, ex-leader of the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, says: 'I fought for democracy in Kosovo - not for democracy in Serbia!'</p> <p>Across the street from the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is the office of Pleurat Sejdiu. During the dark days of Serbian repression he sought asylum in Britain where he drove a minicab. When the war began in 1998, he emerged as the KLA's spokesman in London. Now he shares the job of Kosovo's Minister of Health in the United Nation's administration. 'What happened in Belgrade is good for Serbs but neither good nor bad for others,' he says.</p> <p>Others say Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new President, is a Serbian nationalist just like Milosevic.

      "bodyText": "It is one of the most surreal yet symbolic scenes of the post-war Balkans. Every night a faint glow can be seen through the windows of the great, unfinished Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the centre of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. But the gentle light comes not from candles, ghosts or angels. Inside the church is a large tent. And inside the tent are three Royal Marines commandos. If you come at the right time, they will all be sitting on their sofa clutching mugs of tea and watching EastEnders. A fourth will be outside keeping guard, making sure the church is not razed by Kosovo's Albanians who see it as a symbol of a past and a people they hate. Three weeks after Slobodan Milosevic fell from power, and a week before Kosovo's Albanians cast their votes in their first internationally supervised free election, everything and nothing has changed here. While there is little doubt British troops will be watching EastEnders and protecting Kosovo's Serbian churches and churchgoers for years to come, it is also clear the events in Belgrade have altered the political landscape. Sixteen months ago, at the end of the Kosovo war, as 850,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees streamed home in the wake of Nato's victory, Kosovo's independence seemed imminent. But, now, with the rehabilitation of Serbia's image at the fall of Milosevic, the international community's sympathy for Kosovo's Albanians is over. Their leaders were dismayed at Milosevic's fall. Hashim Thaci, ex-leader of the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, says: 'I fought for democracy in Kosovo - not for democracy in Serbia!' Across the street from the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is the office of Pleurat Sejdiu. During the dark days of Serbian repression he sought asylum in Britain where he drove a minicab. When the war began in 1998, he emerged as the KLA's spokesman in London. Now he shares the job of Kosovo's Minister of Health in the United Nation's administration. 'What happened in Belgrade is good for Serbs but neither good nor bad for others,' he says. Others say Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new President, is a Serbian nationalist just like Milosevic. A picture of him holding a Kalashnikov in Kosovo is proof, say Albanian newspapers, that he was a paramilitary leader. There is no evidence of this and Kostunica says the gun was thrust into his hands during a visit. But there is little doubt that when Kostunica has consolidated his power, probably after Serbia's elections on 23 December, he will turn his attention to Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 may have sealed Serbia's defeat, but it did specify that, pending a resolution of its final status, Kosovo remained part of Yugoslavia. It also said that at a certain, unspecified time 'hundreds' of Yugoslav and Serbian 'personnel' would be allowed to return to Kosovo. So, Kosovo's leaders have been looking on with increasing horror as they see Kostunica courted by Western leaders as diplomats dust down old plans for a federation or confederation of Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. 'There will be no links with Serbia in any confederation,' says Sejdiu, 'end of story.' But it will not be the end. Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs the UN's Kosovo administration, is clearly not relishing the day when Kostunica wants to visit again. 'OK, welcome!' he says. 'But, we would have to organise that in terms of security, so it is a bit premature. But the idea is not stupid. It is really a question of time.' As the Kosovo Albanians go to the polls, this is not what they want to hear. But their leaders have no policies, except independence, about which they all agree. While Serbia's politicians look to the future, Kosovo's poll is about who did what during the war and the last 10 years. Kosovo's Albanian leadership will have to think of a more sophisticated strategy to deal with Serbia than it has had until now.

      "body": "<p>Amid the pouting models, bright lights and sports cars at the Motor Show last week lurked three potent symbols of the deep crisis still gripping the heart of Rover - despite its British rescue earlier this year. </p> <p>The first was a glaring absence - that of Rover itself. </p> <p>The company, recently renamed MG Rover, had decided not to appear at the show despite its location on the manufacturer's doorstep in Birmingham. </p> <p>It had no new models to show and said it did not want to spend the \u00a31 million it typically costs to hire a stand. </p> <p>But a senior executive of a rival carmaker said MG Rover had made a mistake. 'The show will have about 800,000 visitors and probably about a tenth of those will come to our stand wanting to sit in the cars, grab brochures or arrange a test drive. Our exhibit probably cost about \u00a3500,000, and we reckon we will make 500 extra sales as a result and maybe twice that - a minimum of \u00a35m - in additional revenue.' </p> <p>The second symbol was less obvious, but no less ominous - the new Honda Civic. It has been completely redesigned as a hi-tech hatchback with svelte styling and will soon roll out of the Japanese manufacturer's plant in Swindon for sale in Britain in January. </p> <p>This is bad news for Rover because its medium-sized 45 car is based on the current - soon to be the 'old' - Civic, with basic chassis design dating back to when MG Rover and Honda were partners, before BMW bought the British company in 1994. </p> <p>Once the current Civic ceases production at the end of this month it effectively becomes yesterday's car. But MG Rover will carry on turning out the dated 45 as new until it finds the money or the partner to launch a replacement in two or three years' time. </p> <p>The 45 has had a facelift since it was called the Rover 400, but under the groovy new exterior and comfy seats, savvy motorists know its basic engineering goes back a decade. The 25 and MGF convertible are also ageing, along with their engines, and only the 75 executive saloon developed under BMW's ownership is all new. </p> <p>MG Rover chairman John Towers has confidently promised to launch exciting new MG models next year and find a partner to help create a new medium-sized car. He aims to keep Rover in the mainstream, producing 200,000 vehicles a year and competing in the cutthroat middle market with the likes of Ford, Vauxhall, Peugeot, Toyota, Fiat and Renault. </p> <p>But many industry observers are deeply worried that the plan is simply not viable against the giants. The buying public are turning away from MG Rover in their droves as the models fail to appeal. The price war now engulfing the forecourts is likely to damage MG Rover's revenues without sufficiently boosting its market share, which slumped to 3.5 per cent in Britain last month, compared with 12 per cent three years ago, and is only 1.4 per cent in western Europe - less than Skoda. </p> <p>Towers headed the Phoenix British business consortium that took Rover off BMW's hands last spring for \u00a310 after the German carmaker decided to kill off its so-called 'English Patient'. Phoenix stepped in when collapse seemed likely - after UK venture capital outfit Alchemy walked away from a deal to acquire Rover and shrink it to a specialist building 50,000 MG sports cars a year. </p> <p>With a debt-free dowry from BMW of several hundred thousand unsold cars, the Longbridge factory (with its now slimmed-down workforce of 5,500) and \u00a3500m in cash, Phoenix had saved Rover and was the toast of British industry and a relieved UK Government. </p> <p>Towers has since formed a company called Techtronic 2000 to hold the company's shares. He plans to hand 35 per cent of the equity over to the workforce and, as The Observer revealed, is talking to Malaysian carmaker Proton - which owns Lotus - about possible collaboration on a future car, having had partnership approaches to all the volume carmakers rebuffed. </p> <p>Many observers fear MG Rover will be unable to conclude a partnership deal, invest the required billions in new models or increase sales and revenues sufficiently before the cash runs out and time is up. </p> <p>One told The Observer: 'I cannot see how the business is sustainable; there is no clarity of strategic direction. I worry that the Towers plan is just delaying the inevitable and they are looking at a lingering death.' </p> <p>The importance of a strong partner was graphically illustrated by the third symbol of MG Rover's predicament at Birmingham last week - the new Ford Mondeo. The car cost Ford up to \u00a32 billion to develop but the company boasts that when it goes on sale in November, at prices from \u00a314,595, it will cost up to \u00a31,400 less than the current Mondeo and in addition will have about \u00a3800-worth of extra features as standard. </p> <p>There will be 51 different variations of the Mondeo produced from one basic 'platform' but all will have ABS braking, six airbags, electric windows, air conditioning and a CD player as standard. </p> <p>Nick Scheele, chairman of Ford of Europe, said: 'Car buyers want more space, better fuel economy, better safety, more features and lower prices. How do you do that? You take cost out, you talk to suppliers and you put in mega investment, with production and engineering research carried out on a global scale.' </p> <p>Ford makes 8 million cars a year, but even it is losing money in Europe and admits that it has been 'too slow' to replace its Fiesta. How can MG Rover possibly stand up to this kind of economic reality? </p> <p>Ford bought Land-Rover from BMW in the spring and now owns three of Britain's proudest car marques, alongside Aston Martin and Jaguar. Last year it bought Swedish stalwart Volvo, which has plans to increase annual production from 400,000 to 600,000 cars. Ford is busy working out how to share costs between this clutch of businesses. </p> <p>Jaguar is on track to more than double its size and become a 200,000-a-year carmaker when it starts producing the so-called X400 'Baby Jag' at Ford's Halewood factory next year. </p> <p>Managing director Jonathan Browning said last week: 'Could we survive alone? Jaguar's history gives you the answer. It was a private British company in the Eighties and was not able to cope with the pressure of global competition and economic conditions. Then Ford bought it. Nothing has changed fundamentally since then that says we are now any more capable of independence.' </p> <p>In global terms BMW is still a relatively small producer at 800,000 cars, but is fighting vigorously to remain independent and is so far succeeding on the basis of charging premium prices for desirable products. </p> <p>Meanwhile Nick Reilly, chief executive of Vauxhall, said: 'In volume manufacturing you have to have a car platform of 350,000 and really more like 500,000 to 800,000. That is what the competition is going to have, with modern technology at an affordable price. That is the formula.' </p> <p>Developing new cars is so expensive that Vauxhall's parent, General Motors, has bought a stake of 20 per cent in Italian carmaker Fiat: they will share the basic engineering design on future models, building 5 million cars from just two basic platforms. </p> <p>Daimler-Benz has merged with Chrysler and taken Mitsubishi as a Japanese partner; Renault has a controlling stake in Nissan. All are striving for global reach and economies of scale. </p> <p>Without a strong partnership of this kind, most industry and City observers give MG Rover no more than a year to live. If it collapses it will once again send convulsions through British industry - and through Government. But the rest of the world's carmakers and the majority of motorists will barely even notice. </p> <p><strong>Top 10 world car makers</strong></p> <p>1999 world production (millions) </p> <p><strong> 1.

There has been the bare-breasted woman and the Devil. </p> <p>A dispute over pay for actors doing commercials has cost them collectively an estimated $1 million a day, driven advertisers to film in Canada, South Africa, Mexico and Australia, and caused great bitterness between the symbiotic worlds of corporate America and the entertainment industry. But this strike, however lengthy and acrimonious, is only a trailer because the main feature, opening next summer, will not be about the subsidiary matter of commercials but threatens to shut down the entire film and television industry for months. </p> <p>But first strikes first. The Screen Actors' Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists called the current strike nearly six months ago to stop advertisers from altering their pay structure, by which they receive both a fee and 'residuals', payments made whenever a commercial in which the actor appears is reshown. </p> <p>The unions argue that with only 1.4 per cent of the $400 billion spent annually on advertising going to the actors, the employers can well afford to retain the existing method of payment.

They want a simple one-fee system that they claim would leave the actors better off. </p> <p>The actors had hoped the strike would be short and sweet. In fact, it has been long and bitter. Part of the bitterness has been over the lack of coverage the dispute has received, only attracting national attention when someone famous is involved in it. </p> <p>Last week it was Liz Hurley. In July, she had made a commercial for Est\u00e9e Lauder in breach of the strike. She has issued profuse and sincere apologies - 'more mea culpas than a penitent at Lourdes', as Variety put it - explaining that she was unaware that she was strike-breaking. She has just made a $25,000 donation to the strikers and sent a formal letter of apology, but she is still to be summoned to explain herself. </p> <p>There is no reason to doubt her word that it was an honest error, but this did not stop supporters of the strike from picketing the premiere of her new film Bedazzled in Los Angeles last Tuesday with signs reading 'Elizabeth Scably, U Make Me Hurl' and 'Beauty Fades, Honor Doesn't' and scrawling 'scab' over publicity posters. (The film is a remake of the 1967 Stanley Donen film Bedazzled, which starred Peter Cook as the Devil.) </p> <p>The row over Est\u00e9e Lauder gave the strike the prominence for a day or two that it has been able to achieve only fleetingly in similar incidents. When the commercials arm of RSA USA, British directors Ridley and Tony Scott's film company, ran a tasteless ad of an elderly, bare-breasted South African woman proclaiming that 'this is what SAG means in South Africa', and encouraging advertisers to shift film production to that country, all hell broke loose. The unions and many others were outraged. Neither Scott had known anything of the ad and were just as furious; the people responsible have since taken the long walk. When Tiger Woods made a car commercial and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal made a Disneyland ad, they were asked to explain themselves. Woods was unaware that by filming in Canada he was strike-breaking; O'Neal gave his fee to charity. </p> <p>Equally, when stars have made appearances at rallies or donations to the strike there has been a flurry of coverage. Paul Newman, Richard Dreyfuss, Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Jason Robards, Tom Hanks and the cast of Frasier have all featured prominently in support of the strike. Last week it was John Travolta and Kelly Preston putting $25,000 in the kitty, and previous donors like Nicolas Cage ($200,000), Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Harrison Ford (all $100,000) have all helped to keep the hardship fund going. But then this is an odd strike in that many of those at the low-paid end of the acting trade already survive by serving at tables, driving cabs and making jewellery. </p> <p>Advertisers have been holding out, using non-union actors, crossing the border to film, resorting to old ads. The balance of power is not the same as for a normal strike - the advertisers are not losing money, as a car manufacturer or bus company would be; the only hardship is that their executives do not get to have their photos taken with famous actors who do ads for them.Talks have now resumed in New York and there are hopeful signs emerging. But next year's strike is the blockbuster. It will involve both actors and writers. This dispute is also over contracts signed by the actors' and writers' unions which are up for renewal next year - for the Writers' Guild of America on 1 May, for SAG on 1 July - and it is also over how people are reimbursed for work on cable and internet. </p> <p> <strong> WHAT IS PUZZLING</strong> to many outside the industry is that the dispute is now regarded as inevitable and studios are frantically squirrelling away productions. People are accepting less than perfect terms for less than perfect scripts because they know that bad times are just around the corner. </p> <p>The writers are also being told to prepare for a big stoppage. A newsletter to members warns: 'Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or the nicest car you can afford. If you have a TV staff writing job, begin putting money away now.

      "body": "<p>As far as the world was concerned, Beck Weathers was dead, another fatality in the worst climbing tragedy on Everest.</p> <p>Vicious winds and bone-numbing cold had closed around the mountain while Weathers and his companions struggled down from the summit. Lost and exhausted, he apparently succumbed to hypothermia, his body lying exposed on the South Col at more than 26,000ft.</p> <p>Over the next 24 hours, a mountain guide and then a doctor checked on his condition. Both pronounced Weathers, a Texan pathologist, beyond salvation. Nobody had ever woken from a hypothermic coma before, especially at high altitude. His wife was told; the mourning began. Then something amazing happened. Weathers woke up.</p> <p>Four years on, at his Dallas home, he shifts his weight in his armchair with what remains of his arms and smiles slowly. 'I've been a story-teller all my life,' he says, 'it's just I never had a story before. Now I've got a dandy.'</p> <p>But despite his terrible injuries that saw him lose parts of his arms, face and foot, Weathers is happier than ever. 'For the first time in my life I have peace,' he says. 'I no longer seek to define myself externally, through goals and achievements and material possessions. For the first time I'm comfortable in my own skin.'</p> <p>Because while what he suffered on Everest has ended his climbing career, it has helped him overcome the suicidal depression that dogged him for much of his adult life. His terrifying ordeal began on 10 May 1996. As part of New Zealand mountain guide Rob Hall's expedition, Weathers had sunk around $65,000 into climbing Everest, the biggest and hardest challenge in his ambition of reaching the top of the highest peak on each of the seven continents.</p> <p>At 49, he was one of the older climbers that season. He had staked a great deal on getting to the top - his 20-year marriage to Peach, the affection of his children, even his life - but he seems hardly to have been conscious of that. A genial, wise-cracking front masked deep insecurity; he did not just want to climb Everest, he needed to.</p> <p>Looking down at the suburbs of Dallas from the air, you get a sense of where his mental illness and the obsession it spawned originated. As in the opening scene of American Beauty, each leafy street seems the same as the last, secure, insulated, ordinary. Weathers enjoyed the material comforts his successful career afforded him, loved his family, but for long periods felt utterly bereft.</p> <p>'Depression was a controlling aspect of my life,' he says. 'I got pretty suicidal for a while, to the extent that it was scaring the hell out of me.' He sought escape in a string of obsessions, everything from CB radio to sailing. 'The one thing that did help was driving my body to extremes. If you're working yourself hard physically, it gives you this wonderful sense of drawing into yourself and all the problems of your existence disappear. Climbing became a very logical extension of that.'</p> <p>Before the storm, setting off from their high camp on the South Col, Weathers was close to fulfilling his ultimate obsession. The weather was clear, he and his team-mates were hopeful. As they shuffled off into the night, crampons squeaking on the snow and ice, they faced a 12- or 14-hour climb to the summit. But Weathers was destined not to make it there.</p> <p>Before leaving for Nepal, he had undergone a radial keratotomy, effectively tiny incisions in his corneas, to correct his short-sightedness. At altitude, however, his adapted corneas changed shape, leaving him half-blind in the darkness. He was forced to move off the trail and watch as his companions traipsed past toward the summit. He was not beaten. Weathers figured that with bright sunlight his iris would close to protect his retina and give him an immense depth-of-field, bypassing the cornea problem. So it proved, but in wiping his fuzzy eyes, he had scratched an ice crystal across his right cornea, leaving it blurred. Although his left eye worked fine, he had no depth perception, a real handicap on such dangerous terrain.</p> <p>Hall forbade him from going higher, and instructed him to stay put until he returned. 'Cross my heart, hope to die,' he promised Hall. But Hall did not return, instead becoming marooned close to the summit with Doug Hansen, a Seattle postal worker who was too weak to make it down. Despite being encouraged to abandon Hansen, Hall stayed put, dying the following evening.</p> <p>When Hall had left him, at a little after 7.30am, Weathers waited patiently throughout the day for his return, refusing offers from climbers going down the mountain to join them. But by 5pm he knew something was wrong. Jon Krakauer, who later wrote Into Thin Air, the best-selling account of that season on Everest, reached Weathers on his way down from the summit. He told Weathers that Hall was stuck on the summit ridge. Weathers knew now that he should go down, but refused Krakauer's offer of help. He elected instead to wait for another guide from his team, Mike Groom, who helped Weathers scramble down to the South Col as part of a group of weary stragglers destined to endure an appalling night in the open.</p> <p>Close to their tents and safety, the afternoon storm now swelled, clouds boiled over the South Col and the wind thundered. One climber described it as like being lost in a bottle of milk. Disoriented, confused and desperate, the small huddle of climbers almost walked off the edge of the mountain looking for the camp. In the process, Weathers lost his right glove, his hand freezing instantly. Exhausted, and with a huge drop ahead of them, the climbers hunkered down, waiting for a break in the clouds and the chance of rescue.</p> <p>By the time it came, Weathers was beyond salvation. As his companions watched in horror, he stood up against the raging wind, his arms outstretched, his naked right hand frozen solid, like a joint of meat. Standing on the South Col in the middle of the night, deranged with hypothermia and hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues), he was dying.</p> <p>'I've got this all figured out,' he shouted, before the wind toppled him from his feet and he disappeared into the maelstrom, apparently for ever. His friends were rescued by Anatoli Boukreev, but the Russian guide judged Weathers already dead. Next morning, Canadian doctor Stuart Hutchinson and three Sherpas went out searching for Weathers and a Japanese woman, Yasuko Namba, who had also been left behind the night before.</p> <p>Namba was barely alive and Hutchinson had to peel a carapace of ice from her face to examine her. There was, he judged, nothing to be done; Namba's skin was porcelain white, her eyes dilated. Moving on to Weathers, now partially buried in snow, Hutchinson saw the stiff right arm frozen above his head, the jacket opened to the waist, the ice-encrusted face and judged the man in front of him as 'being as close to death and still breathing' as any patient he had seen.</p> <p>The news was released that Weathers was gone. Then, at around 4pm, the miracle occurred. 'I was so far gone in terms of not being connected to where I was,' he says. 'There was a nice, warm, comfortable sense of being in my bed. It was really not unpleasant.'</p> <p>Disorientated by the white clouds and snow, his ungainly arm gave him something to focus on. He banged it against the ground. It sounded like wood. With adrenaline seeping through his system, he began to grasp his predicament. 'This was not bed. This was not a dream,' he says. 'This was real and I'm starting to think: I'm on the mountain but I don't have a clue where. If I don't get up, if I don't stand, if I don't start thinking about where I am and how to get out of there, then this is going to be over very quickly.'</p> <p>As a pathologist, used to watching how the body's cells function through a microscope, does he speculate on what saved him?</p> <p>'As far as I know I'm the only person to have come out of a hypothermic coma in that setting. That awakening is something I don't understand. I've looked at it from the most spiritual and most physical angles. There are things that changed physically during that day which may have been sufficient. And the core of your body can withstand drops in its temperature far beyond what I would have believed.'</p> <p>He cites the example of a man immersed in the North Sea who suffered a core temperature of 82F - 16F below normal body temperature - and could still talk rationally. But it still seems like a marvel to Weathers.</p> <p>This was not a brush with death: as Weathers might say, it was the full spring clean. When he walked into camp, none of the climbers still there could believe the apparition in front of them was the dead Beck Weathers.</p> <p>'This man had no face,' one recalled later. 'It was completely black, solid black, like he had a crust over him.'</p> <p>Everyone there who was still thinking clearly also assumed he would be dead by morning. He was put in a tent on his own, and left alone. His wife was later outraged that her husband should be abandoned to die with no one to comfort him.</p> <p>Weathers is more forgiving. 'Everyone was exhausted. Everyone who was rational was frightened. And I think in terms of the hard choices of what could be done for me - well, they'd done it all. Nobody had any expectation that I would live through the night. But it never occurred to me at that point that I would not live through it.'</p> <p>The events of that day and night on Everest have been mired in controversy, partly because of the media interest that live internet coverage generated. In total, eight climbers died on the mountain. By the time Weathers was on his way to base camp, journalists were arriving in Kathmandu to interview him.</p> <p>'They told me this trip was going to cost me an arm and a leg,' he joked to his rescuers as they helped him down. 'So far, I've gotten a little better deal.'</p> <p>Within hours he was on his way to Kathmandu in a helicopter, the highest rescue ever completed. Weathers was on the cover of Newsweek and made every TV news bulletin, but any thought of cashing in quickly on his experiences was forgotten. He may have joked with his rescuers, but now he feared the return of his depression, terrified that now it would overwhelm him. And leaving aside his physical injuries, his marriage was all but destroyed by the obsession that had left him physically ruined.</p> <p>'That would have been vastly more difficult to deal with,' he says of Peach's doubts about staying. 'I simply don't know, because I didn't have to face it, whether I could have coped.'</p> <p>Instead, she agreed to stay for a year while he adjusted to his injuries. His right arm had thawed and withered. 'It looked,' says Weathers, 'like it had been incinerated.' He had frostbite in his left hand also, in his left foot and all over his face. Nothing could be done for his nose. The frostbite had extended through the soft tissue, his skin and cartilage, right into the bone. Before it was cut away, plastic surgeon Greg Anigian took an impression in tin foil of the original. Weathers was forced to spray the now-exposed nasal passages to keep them moist while surgeons then grew a new nose - upside down - on his forehead, taking cartilage from his ears and skin from his neck, before relocating it where his original had been amputated. He had to be careful, he quips, not to let the kids take a picture for National Enquirer.</p> <p>His right arm was amputated just below the elbow; the left side is better, with what is effectively a fleshy mitt and a crude thumb. He lived through a year of pain as the severed nerves in his arms settled down, like 'constantly being hit on the funny bone', he says. 'It may not look all that fancy, but the reconstruction on the left side is very hi-tech. They did a helluva job. To have any movement and to be able to pick up something.'</p> <p>He shakes his head. 'It's amazing how functional you can be. Four months after they cut my hands off, I went back to work.'</p> <p>When he finally came to write his story, simply telling the world about how he survived was not enough. He and Peach decided to write about how they put their life back together, something climbing had almost destroyed. 'For us, the rationale to do this was not to cover the mountain story but the drives which put you there, the price you pay in terms of relationships. Having had the experience of dying once - it's fine, it's doable. But you don't pay the big price. Knowing that stripped me of a lot of my rationalisations and denial.'</p> <p>He also says he is no longer plagued by depression and although he misses climbing he feels liberated. 'That sense of having to prove myself externally has simply gone. I don't think about things in that way anymore and it has been a huge relief. I think that happens to most people, it just often happens a lot later.</p> <p>'It seems trite to say that I live each day as if it's my last, that the colours are brighter, the sense of the wind in your face is more intense. But it's true, at least for a good part of every day, and that's an exquisite pleasure.'</p> <p>\u0095 'Left For Dead' by Beck Weathers, with Stephen G. Michaud, is published by Little Brown at \u00a316.99.</p>",

His terrifying ordeal began on 10 May 1996. As part of New Zealand mountain guide Rob Hall's expedition, Weathers had sunk around $65,000 into climbing Everest, the biggest and hardest challenge in his ambition of reaching the top of the highest peak on each of the seven continents. At 49, he was one of the older climbers that season. He had staked a great deal on getting to the top - his 20-year marriage to Peach, the affection of his children, even his life - but he seems hardly to have been conscious of that. A genial, wise-cracking front masked deep insecurity; he did not just want to climb Everest, he needed to. Looking down at the suburbs of Dallas from the air, you get a sense of where his mental illness and the obsession it spawned originated. As in the opening scene of American Beauty, each leafy street seems the same as the last, secure, insulated, ordinary. Weathers enjoyed the material comforts his successful career afforded him, loved his family, but for long periods felt utterly bereft. 'Depression was a controlling aspect of my life,' he says. 'I got pretty suicidal for a while, to the extent that it was scaring the hell out of me.' He sought escape in a string of obsessions, everything from CB radio to sailing. 'The one thing that did help was driving my body to extremes. If you're working yourself hard physically, it gives you this wonderful sense of drawing into yourself and all the problems of your existence disappear. Climbing became a very logical extension of that.' Before the storm, setting off from their high camp on the South Col, Weathers was close to fulfilling his ultimate obsession. The weather was clear, he and his team-mates were hopeful. As they shuffled off into the night, crampons squeaking on the snow and ice, they faced a 12- or 14-hour climb to the summit. But Weathers was destined not to make it there. Before leaving for Nepal, he had undergone a radial keratotomy, effectively tiny incisions in his corneas, to correct his short-sightedness. At altitude, however, his adapted corneas changed shape, leaving him half-blind in the darkness. He was forced to move off the trail and watch as his companions traipsed past toward the summit. He was not beaten. Weathers figured that with bright sunlight his iris would close to protect his retina and give him an immense depth-of-field, bypassing the cornea problem. So it proved, but in wiping his fuzzy eyes, he had scratched an ice crystal across his right cornea, leaving it blurred. Although his left eye worked fine, he had no depth perception, a real handicap on such dangerous terrain. Hall forbade him from going higher, and instructed him to stay put until he returned. 'Cross my heart, hope to die,' he promised Hall. But Hall did not return, instead becoming marooned close to the summit with Doug Hansen, a Seattle postal worker who was too weak to make it down. Despite being encouraged to abandon Hansen, Hall stayed put, dying the following evening. When Hall had left him, at a little after 7.30am, Weathers waited patiently throughout the day for his return, refusing offers from climbers going down the mountain to join them. But by 5pm he knew something was wrong. Jon Krakauer, who later wrote Into Thin Air, the best-selling account of that season on Everest, reached Weathers on his way down from the summit. He told Weathers that Hall was stuck on the summit ridge. Weathers knew now that he should go down, but refused Krakauer's offer of help. He elected instead to wait for another guide from his team, Mike Groom, who helped Weathers scramble down to the South Col as part of a group of weary stragglers destined to endure an appalling night in the open. Close to their tents and safety, the afternoon storm now swelled, clouds boiled over the South Col and the wind thundered. One climber described it as like being lost in a bottle of milk. Disoriented, confused and desperate, the small huddle of climbers almost walked off the edge of the mountain looking for the camp. In the process, Weathers lost his right glove, his hand freezing instantly. Exhausted, and with a huge drop ahead of them, the climbers hunkered down, waiting for a break in the clouds and the chance of rescue. By the time it came, Weathers was beyond salvation. As his companions watched in horror, he stood up against the raging wind, his arms outstretched, his naked right hand frozen solid, like a joint of meat. Standing on the South Col in the middle of the night, deranged with hypothermia and hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues), he was dying. 'I've got this all figured out,' he shouted, before the wind toppled him from his feet and he disappeared into the maelstrom, apparently for ever. His friends were rescued by Anatoli Boukreev, but the Russian guide judged Weathers already dead. Next morning, Canadian doctor Stuart Hutchinson and three Sherpas went out searching for Weathers and a Japanese woman, Yasuko Namba, who had also been left behind the night before. Namba was barely alive and Hutchinson had to peel a carapace of ice from her face to examine her. There was, he judged, nothing to be done; Namba's skin was porcelain white, her eyes dilated. Moving on to Weathers, now partially buried in snow, Hutchinson saw the stiff right arm frozen above his head, the jacket opened to the waist, the ice-encrusted face and judged the man in front of him as 'being as close to death and still breathing' as any patient he had seen. The news was released that Weathers was gone. Then, at around 4pm, the miracle occurred. 'I was so far gone in terms of not being connected to where I was,' he says. 'There was a nice, warm, comfortable sense of being in my bed. It was really not unpleasant.' Disorientated by the white clouds and snow, his ungainly arm gave him something to focus on. He banged it against the ground. It sounded like wood. With adrenaline seeping through his system, he began to grasp his predicament. 'This was not bed. This was not a dream,' he says. 'This was real and I'm starting to think: I'm on the mountain but I don't have a clue where. If I don't get up, if I don't stand, if I don't start thinking about where I am and how to get out of there, then this is going to be over very quickly.' As a pathologist, used to watching how the body's cells function through a microscope, does he speculate on what saved him? 'As far as I know I'm the only person to have come out of a hypothermic coma in that setting. That awakening is something I don't understand. I've looked at it from the most spiritual and most physical angles. There are things that changed physically during that day which may have been sufficient. And the core of your body can withstand drops in its temperature far beyond what I would have believed.' He cites the example of a man immersed in the North Sea who suffered a core temperature of 82F - 16F below normal body temperature - and could still talk rationally. But it still seems like a marvel to Weathers. This was not a brush with death: as Weathers might say, it was the full spring clean. When he walked into camp, none of the climbers still there could believe the apparition in front of them was the dead Beck Weathers. 'This man had no face,' one recalled later. 'It was completely black, solid black, like he had a crust over him.' Everyone there who was still thinking clearly also assumed he would be dead by morning. He was put in a tent on his own, and left alone. His wife was later outraged that her husband should be abandoned to die with no one to comfort him. Weathers is more forgiving. 'Everyone was exhausted. Everyone who was rational was frightened. And I think in terms of the hard choices of what could be done for me - well, they'd done it all. Nobody had any expectation that I would live through the night. But it never occurred to me at that point that I would not live through it.' The events of that day and night on Everest have been mired in controversy, partly because of the media interest that live internet coverage generated. In total, eight climbers died on the mountain. By the time Weathers was on his way to base camp, journalists were arriving in Kathmandu to interview him. 'They told me this trip was going to cost me an arm and a leg,' he joked to his rescuers as they helped him down. 'So far, I've gotten a little better deal.' Within hours he was on his way to Kathmandu in a helicopter, the highest rescue ever completed. Weathers was on the cover of Newsweek and made every TV news bulletin, but any thought of cashing in quickly on his experiences was forgotten. He may have joked with his rescuers, but now he feared the return of his depression, terrified that now it would overwhelm him. And leaving aside his physical injuries, his marriage was all but destroyed by the obsession that had left him physically ruined. 'That would have been vastly more difficult to deal with,' he says of Peach's doubts about staying. 'I simply don't know, because I didn't have to face it, whether I could have coped.' Instead, she agreed to stay for a year while he adjusted to his injuries. His right arm had thawed and withered. 'It looked,' says Weathers, 'like it had been incinerated.' He had frostbite in his left hand also, in his left foot and all over his face. Nothing could be done for his nose. The frostbite had extended through the soft tissue, his skin and cartilage, right into the bone. Before it was cut away, plastic surgeon Greg Anigian took an impression in tin foil of the original. Weathers was forced to spray the now-exposed nasal passages to keep them moist while surgeons then grew a new nose - upside down - on his forehead, taking cartilage from his ears and skin from his neck, before relocating it where his original had been amputated. He had to be careful, he quips, not to let the kids take a picture for National Enquirer. His right arm was amputated just below the elbow; the left side is better, with what is effectively a fleshy mitt and a crude thumb. He lived through a year of pain as the severed nerves in his arms settled down, like 'constantly being hit on the funny bone', he says. 'It may not look all that fancy, but the reconstruction on the left side is very hi-tech. They did a helluva job. To have any movement and to be able to pick up something.' He shakes his head. 'It's amazing how functional you can be. Four months after they cut my hands off, I went back to work.' When he finally came to write his story, simply telling the world about how he survived was not enough. He and Peach decided to write about how they put their life back together, something climbing had almost destroyed. 'For us, the rationale to do this was not to cover the mountain story but the drives which put you there, the price you pay in terms of relationships. Having had the experience of dying once - it's fine, it's doable. But you don't pay the big price. Knowing that stripped me of a lot of my rationalisations and denial.' He also says he is no longer plagued by depression and although he misses climbing he feels liberated. 'That sense of having to prove myself externally has simply gone. I don't think about things in that way anymore and it has been a huge relief. I think that happens to most people, it just often happens a lot later. 'It seems trite to say that I live each day as if it's my last, that the colours are brighter, the sense of the wind in your face is more intense. But it's true, at least for a good part of every day, and that's an exquisite pleasure.' \u0095 'Left For Dead' by Beck Weathers, with Stephen G. Michaud, is published by Little Brown at \u00a316.99.",

Palestinian youth trampling over the sacred site of the patriarch Joseph's tomb in Nablus, tearing it apart brick by brick and setting alight the holy books and Torah scrolls in a scene straight from Kristallnacht. There was the blood-stained frenzy of the lynch mob in Ramallah. The body bags filled with American sailors being returned to American bases in Germany from Yemen.

That is the behaviour of those who would sacrifice their children for sake of hollow propaganda. Reservists and soldiers who ignore the collective hatred of the rioters, worked up into a frenzy in the mosques and schools, do so at their personal peril. Any suggestion that this is the non-violent protest of Martin Luther King or the uplifting revolution on the streets of Belgrade does not bear scrutiny.</p> <p>The scene at the tomb of Joseph was quickly expunged from our screens, to be replaced with a video of a Jewish mob attacking a mosque in Nazareth, as if this were a football match with the action moving from one end of the field to the other. But to the Jews of Israel and the Diaspora the scenes in Nablus, where a rabbi was stabbed, had an entirely different meaning. One of the core aspirations of all those involved in the peace process has been to ensure safe and open access to all holy sites, whether they be Jewish, Islamic or Christian.</p> <p>Debates as to whether the Temple Mount as the 2,000-year-old font of Judaism, or the al-Aksa Mosque as the third most holy site in Islam, is more or less important to their respective religions are irrelevant.

Yet this was a bloodless retaliation, carried out after warnings to civilians to leave the streets and without the loss of any life. The message was, desist from random violence.</p> <p>If for the moment the culture of blame, which has distorted the analysis of the events of the last weeks, is put to one side then far more fundamental questions have to be asked. Israeli spokesmen such as veteran peacemaker Shimon Peres, who staked his career on co-existence with the Palestinians, are right to point out that the Jewish state has fulfilled its promise of land for peace. It has given up occupation in large parts of the territories, in Southern Lebanon and in the Golan. But he and other Israeli leaders also need to recognise that the settlements, with their own network of roads and communications through the Judean Hills, remain an affront to Palestinian sovereignty; that Oslo was also about building trade and economic ties throughout the Middle East, so that a superstructure of prosperity brought the communities together.</p> <p>This has never really happened. An August 2000 briefing paper by the World Bank chronicles how output in the West Bank and Gaza declined by 2 to 3 per cent a year between 1994 and 1999.

Progress in the Palestinian areas has been impeded by border and customs restrictions, which have made it enormously difficult for Palestinians to move their goods to market. The peace process has produced land and poverty: an economic cauldron of indifference has boiled up. Israel is right to be indignant about the way the world has turned against it.

      "body": "<p>You and your current life-partner may already have had a heated debate over whether our story on the financial impact of divorce can possibly be true. The respected Institute of Social and Economic Research found that men's fortunes improve (over time) by about 15 per cent following a failed marriage, while their former wives become 28 per cent poorer. 'Nonsense,' said the men in this office. 'Obvious,' said the women, demonstrating that subjectivity and certainty reign supreme in matters of Sex and Money.</p> <p>But men should not be surprised.

The respected Institute of Social and Economic Research found that men's fortunes improve (over time) by about 15 per cent following a failed marriage, while their former wives become 28 per cent poorer. 'Nonsense,' said the men in this office. 'Obvious,' said the women, demonstrating that subjectivity and certainty reign supreme in matters of Sex and Money. But men should not be surprised.

Financially, he says, the move was a nightmare. 'Everything was done in such a hurry with nothing but a wing and a prayer.' With 23 days to go be-fore he took control of the kitchen at the Landmark, the sale of L'Ortolan had failed to go through after several abortive efforts.

      "body": "<p>In July we cancelled a holiday at short notice as our dog, a nine-year-old boxer bitch, had an initial diagnosis of bone cancer. A confirmatory biopsy was urgently required before proceeding with any treatment. </p> <p>I was resigned to losing the cost of the holiday but noted that our dog insurance covered holiday cancellation due to emergency life-threatening operations. </p> <p>However, my claim to Equine &amp; Livestock Insurance was rejected because a biopsy was not considered to be life-threatening. I countered that the operation was life-saving and a biopsy is always required before major surgery. The unrecoverable costs being claimed were \u00a3845.<br><strong>DR, Weymouth </strong></p> <p>Equine &amp; Livestock is sticking to the letter of its policy, which confines payment to limited dates and narrow circumstances. The company says holiday cancellation is a small part of the policy: it receives just a small proportion of the premium so the cover is restricted. </p> <p>Policies pay only if you have to cancel a holiday because a pet has emergency surgery within 14 days of departure and you must inform the company immediately an illness is discovered. </p> <p>Equine &amp; Livestock says you should have told them on 20 June, the day you first took your dog to the vet or, at the latest 6 July, when she had the X-rays and not, as you did, on 1 August, which was the day after the biopsy results confirmed bone cancer. But, even if you had rushed to the insurer immediately you knew your dog was seriously ill, you still could not have met the conditions. </p> <p>The biopsy results came through on 31 July, the day after you should have left on holiday. The vet recommended amputation in the hope of saving your dog's life but obviously this could not have been done within 14 days of your planned departure. </p> <p>The insurer refuses to accept a biopsy as a qualifying operation. If your dog's illness had become apparent just one week earlier, and she had had the operation between 16 and 30 July, you could have claimed \u00a3845. </p> <p><strong> Education in the cost of college</strong></p> <p>We are surprised at the amount we are being asked to contribute to our son's university costs - \u00a31,050 tuition fees and \u00a36,175 to living expenses. On top of that, we have had to buy him cutlery, crockery and a kettle and he still has to pay for food, clothes, books and entertainment. </p> <p>Not wishing to disadvantage him financially, we have arranged monthly payments to cover these amounts but we have read about the expensive cost of studying in London at only a fraction of what we are paying. Are we paying too much?<strong><br>CP, Kibworth </strong></p> <p>You have misread the assessment form. The 'total assessed contribution' of \u00a36,175 is based on your income and is a theoretical figure, which is causing a lot of confusion. </p> <p>The maximum any parent has to pay for tuition fees is \u00a31,050. Parents on comparatively high income also pay \u00a3930 towards living costs but you are not asked to hand the money over. Instead it reduces the size of student loan available to your son, leaving him able to borrow \u00a32,795, which is 75 per cent of the loan.

      "bodyText": "In July we cancelled a holiday at short notice as our dog, a nine-year-old boxer bitch, had an initial diagnosis of bone cancer. A confirmatory biopsy was urgently required before proceeding with any treatment. I was resigned to losing the cost of the holiday but noted that our dog insurance covered holiday cancellation due to emergency life-threatening operations. However, my claim to Equine &amp; Livestock Insurance was rejected because a biopsy was not considered to be life-threatening. I countered that the operation was life-saving and a biopsy is always required before major surgery. The unrecoverable costs being claimed were \u00a3845. DR, Weymouth Equine &amp; Livestock is sticking to the letter of its policy, which confines payment to limited dates and narrow circumstances. The company says holiday cancellation is a small part of the policy: it receives just a small proportion of the premium so the cover is restricted. Policies pay only if you have to cancel a holiday because a pet has emergency surgery within 14 days of departure and you must inform the company immediately an illness is discovered. Equine &amp; Livestock says you should have told them on 20 June, the day you first took your dog to the vet or, at the latest 6 July, when she had the X-rays and not, as you did, on 1 August, which was the day after the biopsy results confirmed bone cancer. But, even if you had rushed to the insurer immediately you knew your dog was seriously ill, you still could not have met the conditions. The biopsy results came through on 31 July, the day after you should have left on holiday. The vet recommended amputation in the hope of saving your dog's life but obviously this could not have been done within 14 days of your planned departure. The insurer refuses to accept a biopsy as a qualifying operation. If your dog's illness had become apparent just one week earlier, and she had had the operation between 16 and 30 July, you could have claimed \u00a3845. Education in the cost of college We are surprised at the amount we are being asked to contribute to our son's university costs - \u00a31,050 tuition fees and \u00a36,175 to living expenses. On top of that, we have had to buy him cutlery, crockery and a kettle and he still has to pay for food, clothes, books and entertainment. Not wishing to disadvantage him financially, we have arranged monthly payments to cover these amounts but we have read about the expensive cost of studying in London at only a fraction of what we are paying. Are we paying too much? CP, Kibworth You have misread the assessment form. The 'total assessed contribution' of \u00a36,175 is based on your income and is a theoretical figure, which is causing a lot of confusion. The maximum any parent has to pay for tuition fees is \u00a31,050. Parents on comparatively high income also pay \u00a3930 towards living costs but you are not asked to hand the money over. Instead it reduces the size of student loan available to your son, leaving him able to borrow \u00a32,795, which is 75 per cent of the loan. The maximum contribution of \u00a31,980 (\u00a31,050 plus \u00a3930) is reduced by \u00a377 for each dependent child you have. You can of course continue to pay him \u00a36,175 in monthly instalments, but you do not have to. Mastering the pensions game My niece, 28, is leaving her job and returning to university for a year to pursue a master's degree. She had been contributing to an occupational pension for three years and wonders what to do with it as she is unlikely to return to the same employer. IC, London She can leave it where it is, transfer to a personal pension or transfer to a new employer's scheme. A final salary scheme is probably best left because the benefits are guaranteed. If it is money purchase she should ask where it is invested and whether she can switch between various funds. At her age, she can afford to take risk and could put some in, say, a technology fund. If she is unhappy with the existing pension provider, the choice of funds or their performance, she can switch to a personal pension. Paying the price for power failure Through my local water company, I have been getting electricity from Independent Energy. There have been numerous problems. The most recent was a cheque from from the company for \u00a320 which bounced. I gather it is now in receivership. Can you investigate? KD, Cambridge Receivers appointed on 8 September sold Independent Energy's assets to Npower. But the problem of Independent Energy's debts, including bounced cheques, is with the receiver and you should write to KPMG, 20 Farringdon Street, London EC4A 4PP to lodge a claim, although realistically you are unlikely to get your money back. If the \u00a320 was a refund for an overpayment by direct debit, you can claim against your bank under the direct debit indemnity scheme. Endowment conundrum Last year I needed to cash in an endowment policy to use as a deposit on a new home but the house purchase fell through. The surrender value was \u00a34,750. In May, we considered selling again and the surrender value was \u00a34,922. In June we were told that the endowment would fall short of our home loan so we decided definitely to get rid of it as it was not needed for the mortgage. But now no auction house wants to sell it, despite their willingness last year, because the surrender value is 'too generous'. The surrender value has fallen to \u00a34,635. DO'N, Radcliffe on Trent The market in selling second-hand life insurance policies relies on investors paying more than the surrender value of a policy, after taking an intermediary's charges into account. When surrender values fall, investors obviously want to pay less and, particularly with small policies like yours, there is little margin left for profit. The number of policies up for sale also affects prices. More have come on to the market recently as homeowners lose confidence in endowments that might not repay their mortgages and this too has depressed prices. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Rd, London EC1R 3ER and include a telephone number.

      "body": "<p>I watched the life drain from a young man who had been shot in the face by the Israeli Defence Force: his skin colour fading to ash while frantic paramedics fought without hope under a darkening sky.</p> <p>A swirl of onlookers surged towards the open-air first aid station, a few hundred yards back from the battle of Nablus: the stink of burning tyres, the sky racked with gunshots cracking out, a whoop-whoop of sirens, groans of the wounded and the dying, screams of angry men, fizzing with fear, grief, helplessness, rage.</p> <p>It was the 48th hour of the 48-hour deadline for peace to break out as set down at the Sharm el-Sheikh summit and a terrible paroxysm of anger was surging through the crowd. A youngster, no more than 12 years old, hammered a red-bereted Palestinian soldier carrying a Kalashnikov. He wanted the gun so he could avenge the dead - and the soldier backed away, terrified of the lad, of the vortex of emotion circling around him.</p> <p>Then the crowd surged towards the first aid station, some men in their rage fighting the paramedics maintaining a ring around the man with the hole in his face.</p> <p>I was standing on the balcony, watching the scene from 20 feet away, and the lady of the house screaming in terror grabbed me and pulled me away from view, lest the mob focus its rage on the outsider. More gunshots, more terror and then I watched the dying man all but thrown into the back of an ambulance.</p> <p>It was four o'clock on Friday afternoon and the man with the hole in his face was one of dozens of wounded and five dead Palestinians who paid the price of Israel's decision to take a 'time-out' from the peace process.</p> <p>It is dead. Whatever the fine words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and President Bill Clinton, the news from the ground, from behind the Palestinian barricades in the West Bank, is that the peace process is dead. As the United Nations voted to condemn the 'excessive use' of Israeli force in the past three weeks the question is: who murdered the last best chance for peace?</p> <p>Look at the numbers. Since the visit to the mosque in Jerusalem on 28 September by the right-wing Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon, 119 people have been killed. Seven Israelis dead, and 112 Palestinians. Look at the ages. All the dead Israelis have been men old enough for military service. Quite a few of the stone throwers picked out in the gun-sights of the Israeli Defence Force have been boys, not men. On Friday on the West Bank they slotted a 13-year old boy with two bullets to the heart.</p> <p>The Israeli Defence Force is one of the best armies in the world. The optics of their weapons are the very best American technology. When the 13-year-old was shot dead, the soldier knew exactly who he was shooting. The target's young face would have loomed large in the gun-sight. It is stupid and wrong for mothers and fathers to allow children out onto the streets to fight an army, but that is not an adequate excuse for killing a child.</p> <p>Look at the economics. Since Oslo, there has been no serious peace dividend for the Palestinians of the West Bank, only more unemployment, less work, less business, more refined restrictions, more imaginative curbs on their freedom of movement, their ability to trade as equals. The Palestinians have given up on the peace process because it wasn't giving them what they wanted - their own country - and they have nothing to lose. The Israelis have much to lose, but they never gave enough to make peace work.</p> <p>And for all the intricate power play between Ehud Barak, the Israeli Prime Minister, President Clinton the peace-maker and Chairman Yasser Arafat, they could not overcome the forces ranged against them.</p> <p>All Sharon had to do was visit the wrong place at the wrong time and the delicate balance of peace was crushed to matchwood.</p> <p>In this climate of hopelessness, all that was needed was an excuse for more killing to take place. The madness in Nablus on Friday came at the end of two funerals for men who had been shot dead in a gun battle occasioned by a 'hike' by Jewish settlers, right-wing religious fundamentalists who choose to live in the West Bank. They had decided to go towards Nablus - a hotbed of Palestinian anger since the time of the British Mandate in the 1930s.</p> <p>The hike was to view Joseph's Tomb, in which stood a sarcophagus thought to house his bones. The site is one of three that Jews claim because they were bought for the 'Jewish people' by characters from the Bible, in this case Jacob, who bought a nearby well from Hamor for 100 pieces of silver (Genesis 33:19). That claim, in the eyes of the settlers, overrides the reality that the Tomb is in a Palestinian-controlled town.</p> <p>The result is that Joseph's Tomb has been a running sore down the ages. In the 1996 disturbances, Israeli troops opened fire on Palestinian rioters near the tomb. After Sharon's visit to the mosque three weeks ago, Palestinian fundamentalists - and there are many in Nablus - wrecked the tomb, and tortured and killed a rabbi who had come to check on it.</p> <p>The tomb today is an empty hulk, freshly white-washed, with only a couple of charred wooden frames evidencing the atrocity.</p> <p>The settlers came armed with M16 automatic assault rifles. They were 40 strong, bringing their women and children too.</p> <p>They were given permission to go towards what is, for a Jew, probably the most dangerous place on earth, Nablus, while the leaders of the world were hoping and praying that the Sharm el-Sheikh summit in Egypt would work its magic on a troubled land. It was a provocation, carried out in righteous conviction by fanatics.</p> <p>So why did the Israeli Defence Force give permission for it to go ahead? 'This was not an attempt to defuse the situation and bring calm,' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. 'When they permitted the hike, they allowed the match to light the explosive.'</p> <p>The gun battle raged for one long hot afternoon last Thursday, the settlers high up on a bluff overlooking Joseph's Tomb, the Palestinians taking cover below them. One Palestinian soldier, Mohammed, 22, told The Observer: 'What happened was that as the settlers were coming down the mountain, what they call Mount Ebal, a white car drove towards them. In it were four Palestinians, men and women, on the way to pick olives. The settlers opened fire first, on this car.'</p> <p>There was no way of checking his story, but what is true is that, pinned down, the settlers used their mobile phones to call for help. 'It is really scary. There is one per son injured and we are waiting for help,' one woman said, four hours into the fighting.</p> <p>There is no good road up there, and the Israelis were forced to call in the helicopter gunships. They opened up on the Palestinian fighters below, on the houses they were taking cover in.</p> <p>And living in those houses, of course, were hundreds of Palestinian civilians. The old woman showed me the gutted ruins of her parlour and the hole in the window where the 50mm armour-piercing bullet had entered and shredded her sofa. The children, aged two, three, four and five, were cowering next door. They had been hurried off to hospital, but had only suffered from smoke damage. 'Thank God,' she said.</p> <p>Two men died in the shoot-out, Rabbi Binyamin Herling, 64, and Palestinian Zahi al-Arda, 34.</p> <p>On Friday morning, before the madness began, both sides buried their dead. The Palestinians processing the cold form of Zahi around Nablus, his face open to the sky.</p> <p>They chanted, and fired gunshots in the air and waved freshly-minted pictures of the martyr in the air. No pictures of Yasser Arafat were on display - the single exception being his 10ft tall smiling face staring out from the Palestinian Ministry of Interior building. Arafat's police watched the mourners pass in an uneasy silence. Many in Nablus believe that the Chairman gave away too much at Sharm el-Sheikh.</p> <p>I drove across the front line - burnt-out tyres, tank tracks on roads chillingly empty of life - and up into a Jewish settlement directly overlooking Nablus called Itmar, looking like nothing more than a spanking new Wimpey-style estate in a war zone.</p> <p>The streets were empty apart from a few kids, one of them a little girl playing on her micro-scooter. On Thursday night some settlers had put up a road-block, using an Austin Montego to create havoc. The road-block's leader roared: 'Welcome to the Wild West Bank.'</p> <p>A woman, originally from New York, made me a cup of tea. She was a sweet woman, still trembling from having seen the gunships fire at the hillside across the valley from her neighbour's porch the previous day.</p> <p>Had I driven alone? I explained that I had left my Palestinian driver in Nablus, having promised him that I wasn't going to steal his taxi. She flashed back: 'It's probably one of ours anyway.'</p> <p>And that was almost as bad as the man with the hole in his face: a transparently good woman, mouthing hate for a taxi driver she'd never met simply because he was of another race.</p> <p>Yesterday morning there were five more funerals in Nablus.

I explained that I had left my Palestinian driver in Nablus, having promised him that I wasn't going to steal his taxi. She flashed back: 'It's probably one of ours anyway.' And that was almost as bad as the man with the hole in his face: a transparently good woman, mouthing hate for a taxi driver she'd never met simply because he was of another race. Yesterday morning there were five more funerals in Nablus. So it goes.

He has been working shifts for the past 29 years - daytime, evening and night, and only has one weekend off every six weeks. 'I am fed up working in this way,' he says. </p> <p>One of the advantages of having stuck it out this long is that he can look forward to a decent pension in retirement, but he is not allowed to start drawing it until he is at least 55. His ideal would be to retire at 50 or soon after. He estimates his family would need an income of around \u00a315,000 to keep themselves going. He thinks he might still do some work to keep himself 'ticking over' but would like to know if his investments will keep him afloat until his pension comes into effect at 55. </p> <p>Noel and his wife, Noreen, have managed to save a fair amount. They both took out Peps with Bradford &amp; Bingley, which are now worth around \u00a322,000. Both have deposited the maximum in mini cash Isas with Nationwide for this tax year and the year before and they now have a total of \u00a312,000 in these accounts. </p> <p>Noel is always on the lookout for the best interest rates and he recently transferred money from an Egg account into the Nationwide's internet based 'e-account', which pays a better rate. This account is held in Noreen's name to take advantage of the fact that as a non-taxpayer she does not have to pay any tax on the interest. It contains \u00a319,500, although Noel says they will be withdrawing \u00a35,000 next year for a new car. </p> <p>Noreen has \u00a310,000, which she inherited, in a one-year Woolwich fixed interest bond. She is a housewife and mother to the couple's children, Nicola, 12, and Thomas, 10. She also works a few hours a week as a school dinner supervisor, but does not earn more than \u00a31,000 a year doing this. When she was younger she was employed by Abbey National, where she accumulated around eight years' worth of pension. </p> <p>One thing they will not have to worry about if Noel stops working is their mortgage repayments, as they have already paid off their loan. Sensibly, they continued with the endowments they had taken out initially to cover their loan. The first of these, with Scottish Provident, is due to mature in 2002 and Noel expects it to be worth around \u00a320,000. A policy with Royal London that comes to an end six years later is likely to be worth a similar amount.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Andrew Jones</strong></p> <p>Noel's long-lasting pension contributions should provide him with a pension of nearly two-thirds of his final salary that will increase annually with inflation. </p> <p>To help bridge the five-year gap between Noel's desired retirement age of 50 and his pension starting age of 55, the couple will have their joint savings of \u00a358,500, after they have bought their new car, which will rise to \u00a378,500 once they receive the proceeds of their Scottish Provident endowment. This means they could not survive for five years without spending capital.</p> <p>If they were to invest their savings for income, they could expect to receive an income yield of approximately 6.5 per cent from conservative investments such as corporate bonds. This would generate a gross annual income of \u00a35,100, which would not be sufficient to meet their needs.</p> <p>Noel mentions he may take up another job and this is likely to be the key to his plans. If it is assumed he can earn \u00a310,000 per year the requirement to earn \u00a315,000 in total is more easily achieved. Rather than focus on using all their assets to generate income, they should consider taking their income initially from their taxed savings accounts and the proceeds of their endowment policies. They could also use some of this capital to buy further Isas.</p> <p>In the case of their existing Tessas, Peps and Isas the income should ideally be left untouched to maximise the tax benefits. In future years these can be used to produce a tax efficient income.</p> <p>Andrew Jones works for chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy</strong></p> <p>Noel and Noreen should try to avoid dipping into their capital to support themselves. They would be better investing the capital to generate tax-free income. This is important from Noreen's point of view as she will be vulnerable in the event that Noel dies before her. Although she will be eligible for a widow's pension, it will be less than his and to have the invested capital will provide her with greater protection. </p> <p>They really need to maximise their Isa investments so they can generate as much tax-free income as possible if Noel stops work. They have invested in mini cash Isas already this year, so they can invest \u00a31,000 each into an insurance Isa (i.e. a single premium with-profits investment with a company such as Sun Life) and a further \u00a33,000 each into a stocks and shares Isa. They could consider investing for growth now with companies with a good range of funds, such as Aberdeen or Fidelity, switching into income-generating funds later.</p> <p>They should put \u00a35,000 each into stocks and shares Isas next year and the proceeds of the Scottish Provident policy in 2002 could go towards the Isas for that year and the one following. If Noel stops work, there is the option to switch all these stocks and shares Isas and the Bradford &amp; Bingley Peps into higher income generating funds. Once Noel and Noreen's pensions come into play, they can adjust their investments, perhaps switching back into some more growth oriented or balanced funds. </p> <p>Gillian Cardy works for financial advisers Professional Partnerships. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

Noel is always on the lookout for the best interest rates and he recently transferred money from an Egg account into the Nationwide's internet based 'e-account', which pays a better rate. This account is held in Noreen's name to take advantage of the fact that as a non-taxpayer she does not have to pay any tax on the interest. It contains \u00a319,500, although Noel says they will be withdrawing \u00a35,000 next year for a new car. Noreen has \u00a310,000, which she inherited, in a one-year Woolwich fixed interest bond. She is a housewife and mother to the couple's children, Nicola, 12, and Thomas, 10. She also works a few hours a week as a school dinner supervisor, but does not earn more than \u00a31,000 a year doing this. When she was younger she was employed by Abbey National, where she accumulated around eight years' worth of pension. One thing they will not have to worry about if Noel stops working is their mortgage repayments, as they have already paid off their loan. Sensibly, they continued with the endowments they had taken out initially to cover their loan. The first of these, with Scottish Provident, is due to mature in 2002 and Noel expects it to be worth around \u00a320,000. A policy with Royal London that comes to an end six years later is likely to be worth a similar amount. Adviser 1: Andrew Jones Noel's long-lasting pension contributions should provide him with a pension of nearly two-thirds of his final salary that will increase annually with inflation. To help bridge the five-year gap between Noel's desired retirement age of 50 and his pension starting age of 55, the couple will have their joint savings of \u00a358,500, after they have bought their new car, which will rise to \u00a378,500 once they receive the proceeds of their Scottish Provident endowment. This means they could not survive for five years without spending capital. If they were to invest their savings for income, they could expect to receive an income yield of approximately 6.5 per cent from conservative investments such as corporate bonds. This would generate a gross annual income of \u00a35,100, which would not be sufficient to meet their needs. Noel mentions he may take up another job and this is likely to be the key to his plans. If it is assumed he can earn \u00a310,000 per year the requirement to earn \u00a315,000 in total is more easily achieved. Rather than focus on using all their assets to generate income, they should consider taking their income initially from their taxed savings accounts and the proceeds of their endowment policies. They could also use some of this capital to buy further Isas. In the case of their existing Tessas, Peps and Isas the income should ideally be left untouched to maximise the tax benefits. In future years these can be used to produce a tax efficient income. Andrew Jones works for chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg. Adviser 2: Gillian Cardy Noel and Noreen should try to avoid dipping into their capital to support themselves. They would be better investing the capital to generate tax-free income. This is important from Noreen's point of view as she will be vulnerable in the event that Noel dies before her. Although she will be eligible for a widow's pension, it will be less than his and to have the invested capital will provide her with greater protection. They really need to maximise their Isa investments so they can generate as much tax-free income as possible if Noel stops work. They have invested in mini cash Isas already this year, so they can invest \u00a31,000 each into an insurance Isa (i.e. a single premium with-profits investment with a company such as Sun Life) and a further \u00a33,000 each into a stocks and shares Isa. They could consider investing for growth now with companies with a good range of funds, such as Aberdeen or Fidelity, switching into income-generating funds later. They should put \u00a35,000 each into stocks and shares Isas next year and the proceeds of the Scottish Provident policy in 2002 could go towards the Isas for that year and the one following. If Noel stops work, there is the option to switch all these stocks and shares Isas and the Bradford &amp; Bingley Peps into higher income generating funds. Once Noel and Noreen's pensions come into play, they can adjust their investments, perhaps switching back into some more growth oriented or balanced funds.

We still want to belong but we do it with cars, kitchens and credit cards. And keeping up with the Joneses has never been so much fun. According to economic psychologist Professor Paul Webley of Exeter University we shop for pleasure - as opposed to need - because we can afford to do so. Although the divide between rich and poor is growing, middle-income families are increasingly well off. According to the British Lifestyles 2000 survey from Mintel, in the past 10 years gross income has increased by 22 per cent in real terms.

People work more to earn more and so on,' said Webley. According to Peter Ayton, chief statistician at Mintel, an example of a luxury that has become a necessity for many people is the dishwasher. And as the prices of such domestic appliances have not risen in real terms, they have become more affordable. </p> <p>But this affordability also carries a sting in the tail. The appliance may be more affordable, but service costs have continued to rise, largely due to the fact that labour costs, which are a big part of service pricing, have increased. Once we buy something like a dishwasher we have to look after it; we may have to insure it (as part of our house contents, or with a product warranty), further driving up our spending. Failing that, the cost of major repairs, when they come, may seem relatively high compared with simply dumping the old dishwasher and buying a new one. </p> <p>At the same time we are being subjected to increasingly sophisticated marketing techniques as manufacturers and retailers compete for our custom. Not only do we choose a dishwasher on the basis of cost and efficiency, but also upon whether it will match our new kitchen decor. And if we change the decor, which we do with increasing frequency, the dishwasher may have to go, along with the fridge, the freezer and washing machine. Our home and garden have become colour co-ordinated accessories for our lifestyles. </p> <p>'It's almost as if we need the appropriate interior backdrop to go with the clothes we are wearing,' observed Andrew Bolton, a V&amp;A and London College of Fashion research fellow.

Risk: Medium/high. Should you invest? Patrick Connolly of Bath firm Chartwell is not impressed: 'Fidelity is one of the best investment houses, and in terms of resources it is second to none. But it's gone a bit over the top with the number of funds that it's launching. It has 38 funds at the moment, and the choice is likely to confuse investors who could end up overexposed to some very specialist and volatile areas.' Michael Usher, of London firm Brooks Macdonald Gayer, agrees: 'Timing is everything when it comes to investing in funds like these and many investors will end up wondering - when they should be investing in industries or healthcare.' Points out of 10: Connolly - 3, Usher - 4.",

      "body": "<b>Martin Bell:</b> It must have been 1965 when I first went to La Gaffe. I'd just joined the BBC and was living in Belsize Park; it was local and, being a creature of habit, I've been going there ever since. It's grown over the years, but in the 60s it was a tiny place with checked tablecloths and candles in bottles. I got to know Bernardo gradually, but I liked him immediately. He's always ebullient, a genial host, and he hasn't changed over the years. Well, he had more hair in those days and was a little thinner, but so was I. <p>I've celebrated quite a few major landmarks of my life with Bernardo. When I married my first wife we had our wedding party at La Gaffe, and it's where I had the launch party for my book, In Harm's Way, and where I usually see the New Year in.</p> <p>When the going gets tough, Bernardo and his wife Androulla, whom I adore, are always there. When it was first announced that I was standing as a parliamentary candidate, it felt as if everybody was after me. It was scary. I went into hiding at La Gaffe and Bernardo and Androulla really looked after me. There were lots of pictures of me in the restaurant the next day, nervously talking into my mobile phone.</p> <p>Although Bernardo runs a wonderful restaurant, his first love is writing.

      "bodyText": "Martin Bell: It must have been 1965 when I first went to La Gaffe. I'd just joined the BBC and was living in Belsize Park; it was local and, being a creature of habit, I've been going there ever since. It's grown over the years, but in the 60s it was a tiny place with checked tablecloths and candles in bottles. I got to know Bernardo gradually, but I liked him immediately. He's always ebullient, a genial host, and he hasn't changed over the years. Well, he had more hair in those days and was a little thinner, but so was I. I've celebrated quite a few major landmarks of my life with Bernardo. When I married my first wife we had our wedding party at La Gaffe, and it's where I had the launch party for my book, In Harm's Way, and where I usually see the New Year in. When the going gets tough, Bernardo and his wife Androulla, whom I adore, are always there. When it was first announced that I was standing as a parliamentary candidate, it felt as if everybody was after me. It was scary. I went into hiding at La Gaffe and Bernardo and Androulla really looked after me. There were lots of pictures of me in the restaurant the next day, nervously talking into my mobile phone. Although Bernardo runs a wonderful restaurant, his first love is writing. He writes mainly plays and poems. When he went to Bosnia to research an idea he had for a play about a Muslim Serb couple, I introduced him to a good friend, a lovely woman whose husband was killed by mortar fire in the early days of the war. I know that she gave him great insight into the situation over there and I'm sure it was a better play as a result. There's been a lot of interest in Bernardo's play, When in Rome, mainly I think because, according to the publicity, it's about 'two men swept into an orgy of bacchanalian proportions'. A lot of people have been trying to get a quote from me about it, but as I haven't read it there isn't much I can say. La Gaffe has become a home away from home for me. I've made a lot of good friends there. I don't like name-dropping, but a lot of interesting people go there. You know the same people will be there.

      "body": "<p>When the viola player charged off the stage, his colleagues assumed he'd broken a string. The violist knew differently. This was the end of his career.</p> <p>It had started earlier during the performance - a nagging voice in his head telling him he was 'a fraud' and 'not good enough' to be there. 'My bow hand started to tremble. I doubt the person next to me even noticed, but it felt like an earthquake. My hand started to freeze so the vibrato sounded like a nanny goat.' It was a three-hour performance and it would be a torment to survive. 'My heart was going 19 to the dozen. I felt sheer terror - claustrophobia. I was playing in a sea of strings and had to swim with everyone else. It was like being in a straitjacket.</p> <p>I felt cold and tingly, even my vision was affected, I could barely see the music. Stage fright is exhausting. I thought I would collapse.'</p> <p>The performance was a success and, to prolong the violist's agony, the audience cried for more. The encore would be just four minutes long and the music was technically unchallenging, but it was still too much. 'As I rushed out, a brass player was coming on to the stage. I handed him my instrument then slid down the wall on to the floor. The man asked me my name but I couldn't remember it. I was so relieved to be off stage, but also very ashamed.' Today, relaxed and happy, the man still refuses to reveal his name. The professional stigma of stage fright in the performing world is too shaming - the taboo too insurmountable.</p> <p>In the trade, a bad case of the shakes is known as 'the pearlies' as in 'Pearly Gates', says Julian Maunder, who teaches strings and offers shiatsu to stressed musicians. He says these people would rather suffer in silence than risk their careers. 'It's like people calling cancer \"the Big C\". They think if they say it they will catch it. Stage fright is the same.'</p> <p>Strangely, performers are not just hush-hush about stage fright and stress but also illnesses and injuries generally. 'Within all of the performing arts, the pervading attitude is that the show must go on. Performers are expected to overcome injuries and illness. If you fail to overcome this, there will always be 30 to 50 people wanting to step into your shoes. There is no incentive to put your hand up and say, \"I need time out,\"' explains Eileen Quilter Williams, general administrator of the British Performing Arts Medicine Trust (BPAMT).</p> <p>The Trust, a registered charity whose patrons include Richard Baker, Simon Rattle and Cliff Richard, among others, is now in its 16th year. It offers a designated health service to performers, including musicians (popular and classical), actors and dancers. It views these professionals as special cases not dissimilar to sports stars. Here is a group for whom even minor medical problems can impact on their very livelihoods. A sore throat, for example - a mere inconvenience for most of us - could be momentous for an opera singer.</p> <p>In addition, punishing schedules bring a whole raft of occupational hazards into play. Musicians are at risk of muscular problems and hearing difficulties. Actors and dancers risk injury. Irregular hours and long rehearsals allow little time for healthy living and the competitive nature of showbiz raises stress levels into the stratosphere. It is either ironic or a classic example of self-protective denial that the performing world thrives on a culture of repression. It's a case of put up or shut up.</p> <p>Angelina Spurrier, a classical ballerina who works at the BPAMT, remembers one director telling any dancer who complained: 'I have a top hat full of names of girls who will dance for me for nothing.' During her career touring in Germany, she says she never dared show any weaknesses. 'You had to appear to be 100 per cent focused at all times. Any anxiety and even injuries had to be buried. So many of the girls I worked with had eating disorders or drinking problems and everybody smoked.'</p> <p>But the culture is changing. Increasing numbers of performers are learning of the BPAMT's existence and turning to it for help, while health and safety legislation means employers can no longer afford to be complacent.</p> <p>Typically, a performer's first contact with the BPAMT is made via the charity's helpline. Around 20 to 30 people call each day and most are invited to attend one of its clinics or are put in touch with an appropriate consultant, doctor or therapist. At the BPAMT's headquarters in London's Covent Garden, Louise Miller, a GP working part time in a city practice, is holding her monthly clinic. Like so many of the Trust's doctors, she has a strong interest in the performing arts, singing in a choir and playing the cello. She gives her time for free, offering each patient a 30-minute consultation - a luxury compared to the seven to 10 minutes most of us get when we visit our doctor.</p> <p>'I love coming here. I never know who is going to walk through the door next. I have seen everything: actors with acne, singers who think their voices change when they go on the pill, tumblers with back problems, dancers with eating disorders, keyboard players with neck problems,' explains Dr Miller. The list goes on. Musicians arrive with their instruments. Dr Miller likes to watch how they play, as their posture or the way they move or hold their instrument can provide diagnostic clues. If an instrument is too big to carry, she will have them simulate the movement by using her desk as, say, a mock keyboard or drum kit.</p> <p>Simon Hallett, a double-bass player with the Royal Opera House Orchestra, consults Dr Miller with an archetypal musician's complaint. He has hearing problems. 'The pit is so enclosed that it is like a resonating box. Over the last 12 to 18 months, I have experienced a loss of high frequency sounds and I also have mild tinnitus,' he explains. He has already seen a doctor but wants a second opinion from the BPAMT's empathetic and knowledgeable medical team.</p> <p>'An ordinary GP may not recognise that the problem takes on a new importance because you are a musician. They will treat you the same as if you are a bricklayer,' says Hallett. He is delighted that the Trust also helps raise awareness. When he first joined his orchestra, musicians were not offered hearing tests and nobody wore earplugs. Now this is standard practice. Dr Miller is familiar with the issue - the use of earplugs is one of her hobbyhorses. As well as running clinics at the Trust, she is the medical advisor to the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) and insists that all its musicians wear earplugs.</p> <p>Placing doctors with orchestras is another service overseen by the Trust. Dr Miller was assigned to the LPO in April last year and remembers being invited to stand on the conductor's rostrum to introduce herself to the 'band'. As a perk, she gets to see her patients perform for free. 'As they come on stage, I wonder how they are feeling. It is very nice going to a concert where you know the performers.' Dr Miller visits the orchestra every three to four weeks, whenever it is resident in London. Her sessions take the form of an open house. Any LPO performer with a medical issue can consult her.</p> <p>Typical problems include string players with muscular-skeletal problems, musicians with hearing problems or complaints about stress, exhaustion or performance anxiety. For the latter, she may suggest relaxation techniques or, if a performance is imminent, prescribe beta-blockers. However, if the problem is more severe, she might refer the patient on to one of the BPAMT's specialists, such as psychotherapist Tony Yates. The frightened viola player (not a member of the LPO) who dashed from the stage found help via the Trust. Tony describes the man's 'critical inner voice' as 'a severe superego'. It is a phenomenon he sees commonly. He says the problem normally stems from childhood, where the critical voice was that of a pushy parent.</p> <p>'This inner voice may be partly aspirational (it tells you how to perform better) but is also partly judgmental,' says Yates. As part of his therapy, he teaches the patient to 'separate their self-esteem from the performance'. In other words, the person is taught to have an identity outside their work.</p> <p>'Interestingly, the minute you take the focus off the performance and look at the person's whole life, the performance problem starts to diminish,' he says.</p> <p>He likens the process to marital therapy, which may bring a couple closer or help them to separate. And so it is with performers. Therapy helped make the viola player 'psychologically healthier', but he has stopped performing professionally. 'Now I just play for the hell of it. I play better now than before because I no longer carry that burden.'</p> <p><b>What is the BPAMT?</b></p> <p>The British Performing Arts Medicine Trust (BPAMT) is a charity that puts performing artists in touch with a network of doctors, associated professionals and alternative practitioners experienced in performing artists' problems.</p> <p>Regular clinics are held at the BPAMT's headquarters in London and Manchester.

      "bodyText": "Mighty useful Take a look at Empresaria, the Ofex-quoted recruitment business chaired by David Telling, the driving force behind Mitie Group. Mitie (Management Incentive Through Investment Equity) has an excellent track record in the building services sector since Telling set up the firm in 1987 after selling his Hat Group. In the past two years, indeed, the shares have trebled as it reaps the dividends of Mitie's way of motivating key managers by setting them up with stakes in subsidiaries. Empresaria, managed by Miles Hunt, is now putting Mitie's venture-capital-cum-franchise formula into practice in the recruitment sector. The firm has never craved publicity, but it is making progress in a quiet way. Clearly, with only one market maker, in the form of JP Jenkins, Ofex will always be risky, but Telling's latest venture may well be something to shout about.

      "body": "<p>Any man will to some extent agree that a rudimentary understanding of the condition commonly known as PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) is essential. For a man, to be forewarned and forearmed means to be better able to understand and possibly be of worthwhile help. For a woman, to be able to justify why all hell breaks loose once a month might make her feel more in control of the situation - for feeling out of control is the crux of the problem.</p> <p>The process of menstruation is complex, involving three major, and inextricably linked, organs. First, according to those Oriental doctors of old, your spleen (under your ribs on the left) is integrally connected to your pituitary gland, master-switch of the endocrine system. This controls your appetite (especially for sweet things), your short-term memory, your feelings of satisfaction with life on a moment-by-moment basis and, most importantly, the overall production of blood. In the few days leading up to menstruation, the spleen has to work twice as hard to build blood to replace that which will be lost during the period. That's why you crave more sweet food, can't remember where you left your keys and whatever someone says or does is not good enough.</p> <p>Second, your liver, whose job it is to store, purify and release the blood on demand, is also in charge of your 'animal soul' - the wild one within, with all its potential for unbridled emotional chaos, including and especially the expression of rage. Just before the period, as the liver cranks up to work overtime on the new blood load, it strains, overheats and, in so doing, loses control of the wild woman. Hence the sudden bursts of unprovoked anger and feelings of frustration: whether in your relationships or your work. When added to a maladjusted spleen, this can produce an inflammatory mix.</p> <p>Third, the kidneys, responsible for overall maintenance of the womb and reproductive system, are also in charge of eliminating waste (through urination), regulating body fluids, maintaining body temperature, stabilising the emotional landscape in general and the flow of tears in particular, and keeping you feeling safe in the world. The kidneys are, with the help of the spleen and liver, in charge of providing, circulating and regenerating the yin or female energy for the entire system, itself intricately interlinked with all internal functions and especially the 100 per cent, no-men-need-apply menstrual process.</p> <p>Just before the period, the kidneys tend to suffer an appreciable loss of energy through the extra exertion, potentially leaving you weepy, bloated, temperamental, anxious, occasionally spotty, clammy, hot and cold, fraught and feeling like you can't cope. So when you throw depleted kidney energy into the equation, you have the full three-dimensional horror of full-blown PMS, complete with anguish, hurled plates and household nuclear war.</p> <p>To suggest a universal remedy is as impossible as suggesting which colour T-shirt would suit everyone in the UK. It all depends on the constitutional state of the liver, spleen, kidneys, reproductive system, hormone levels and temperament of the individual.</p> <p>However, it is fair to say that agnus castus can work wonders in reducing water retention and often all other symptoms, too. Mega B complex with extra B6 can be helpful in supporting the liver.</p> <p>Donquai is effective for keeping the kidneys strong and supporting the general yin energy of the body, and raw beets can be good for supporting the spleen and strengthening the blood. Acupuncture works well for some people, as does cranio-sacral therapy, as in fact do most alternative methods aimed at rebalancing energy flow. But with all these suggestions, it's important to remember that rebalancing requires time - perhaps many menstrual cycles - and hence patience.</p> <p>As for the men, it's important for us to recognise the signs early and, above all, be willing not to take things personally. As you've no doubt heard countless times before, the best you can do when caught in hormonal crossfire is to ignore all missiles and shrapnel and go over and give her a tender, loving cuddle. Just don't expect a reward.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, My doctor believes I have gallstones and has referred me for a scan. The waiting list is one year. In the meantime, I am controlling the symptoms (pain under right ribs and vomiting) by reducing fat intake and following your advice to take fresh lemon juice in water, morning and night. My doctor expects I will need an operation to remove my gall bladder. Is there any alternative to this? I have been told that lemon juice will dissolve the stones. Is this correct? As I will be drinking lemon juice for 12 months, are there likely to be any harmful effects?<br><b> Jean Johnson, Lancashire</b></p> <p>Dear Jean, It is possible sometimes to dissolve gallstones with lemon juice, but it's not guaranteed. However, as you have to wait a year to be seen, and lemon juice in water twice a day is both helpful and harmless, it seems your best option for now. As for alternatives to surgery, obviously dietary advice from a nutritionist will be useful, as well as cranio-sacral therapy to keep the energy moving through the gall bladder. Learning to relax more generally will also help, as stress makes the gall bladder overheat. If, however, you do end up having surgery, be assured that this operation is highly successful and relatively easy on the body.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, Since the death of my son three years ago, I have developed various 'conditions' which I manage, except for tinnitus. This stops me from being able to spend quiet time to try and find some spiritual sense about what has happened to him - and to me. I have tried background tapes, but these seem to exacerbate the sounds rather than mask them. Do you have any suggestions? <br><b>Patricia Holmes, via email</b></p> <p>Dear Patricia, Tinnitus, unless caused by physical damage to the eardrum by loud noise, originates from low kidney energy, as the ears are said to be the flower of the kidneys.</p> <p>The trauma of your son's death must have significantly weakened the kidney energy.</p> <p>Press your thumbs into the ridges of muscle that run down either side of the spine around the kidney region (in the lower back) every day for a minute or so, especially in the late afternoon, when the kidneys are most susceptible. Also massage the ears themselves quite vigorously between thumb and finger to increase circulation.

      "body": "<p>Acne, scourge of teenagers everywhere, came out of the shadows and into the business spotlight last week. </p> <p>It was Boots the Chemists' biggest acquisition since it disastrously overpaid for Halfords, Payless and Fads 10 years ago. The UK's most powerful pharmacy chain splashed out \u00a3233 million for the Clearasil and Biactol spot remedy brands from US Pringles-to-Pampers giant, Procter &amp; Gamble. </p> <p>For Boots, the deal gives it vital US penetration. Clearasil, invented in the late Forties by American Ivan Combe - the man behind Odor-Eaters and the Grecian men's hair formula - is a market leader in the States. The product will act as a bridgehead for Boots' other big-name, over-the-counter health products, which include Nurofen and Strepsils. It will also bolster its other teenage skincare products. </p> <p>Over the last four years, Boots has bought teenage skincare products in both France and Germany to tap into a worldwide acne consumer market worth \u00a31.5 billion and growing by 5 per cent each year. The prescribed acne-related drug market is worth another \u00a31bn. </p> <p>But more importantly Boots sees this acquisition as a way of enticing more customers on a long-term basis. The theory is that if Boots can be the teenagers' friend in their darkest hour, they will stay with the trusted health care group throughout their lives. </p> <p>Analysts, who have mostly been bearish on Boots as its shares have slid from a high of \u00a310.70 in mid-1998 to \u00a35.40 this weekend, praised the deal, despite the Nottingham-based firm paying a high price for the brand - 2.5 times its annual \u00a394m worldwide sales. </p> <p>'It's a clearly defined strategy,' said one. 'Boots knows its future lies in healthcare and related services. Its pharmacy division is under attack as margins are reduced thanks to the aggressive pricing strategies of Wal-Mart and Tesco. Healthcare is a growing market and it is how it can become a world player and create shareholder value. This deal gives it more than a foothold into global markets. It makes sense.' </p> <p>Barry Clare, Boots Healthcare International's managing director, explained why he thinks acne is a market worth tapping. 'Central heating, less time spent on outdoor activity, less time spent on healthy pursuits and worsening diets are driving up the problem.' </p> <p>Clare, who confirmed that similar consumer healthcare product acquisitions were on the cards, is intent on a massive Clearasil marketing push. The brands, he believes, stagnated under the ownership of Procter &amp; Gamble, which instead concentrated on its Olay beauty products. </p> <p>But in the week in which Body Shop boss Anita Roddick slammed anti-ageing creams as 'pap', there are many who fear that companies such as Boots and SmithKline Beecham, which makes the rival Oxy product, are making unrealistic claims for their brands. </p> <p>'There are no overnight cures for acne,' said Acne Support Group chief executive, Alison Dudley. 'The old Clearasil ads showed the amount of dirt that comes off cotton wool thanks to Clearasil. The inference is that acne is caused by dirt. This is totally inaccurate. You cannot wash away spots. The blame doesn't lie with the products. It lies with the hazy, misleading messages. </p> <p>'Kids are more likely to have less self-worth as increasingly people are aware of beauty and skin care. Airbrushed images in the media tell us we could and should have perfect skin and this is what these products are preying on.' </p> <p>Boots is adamant that it will take a responsible attitude to its advertising. </p> <p>It needs to. 'Pus Daddy' is the latest jibe meted out to those with acne by school kids increasingly obsessed with personal appearance. </p> <p>According to the British Association of Dermatologists, 85 per cent of the population suffer from acne at some point in their youth and 15 per cent have severe problems. </p> <p>The London-based Acne Support Group says that 15 per cent of those questioned in a recent survey felt suicidal as a result of the condition. </p> <p>But those with acne are often too embarrassed to talk to a doctor. And if they do, they are usually fobbed off with a pat 'it'll pass' response. By the age of 25, it usually does. But the disease, for which there are no cures - just treatments - is regarded as trivial. 'The market has been talking down to the customer,' admitted Clare. </p> <p>However, in the reclusive world of spot sufferers there are more pressing fears. Last month the US Food and Drug Administration met to discuss whether to restrict the use of the anti-acne drug Roaccutane, produced by Swiss-firm Roche Products. The drug has been 'associated' with depression and even suicide. </p> <p>America's FDA decided against restricting it, but demanded that Roche compile a register of all those prescribed the drug, which is taken by mouth and can cause birth defects in the offspring of women pregnant while taking the drug. </p> <p>The FDA continues to monitor the situation and a spokeswoman said: 'There's enough evidence to indicate an association [with psychiatric disorders] but not enough to suggest a causal link.' </p> <p>There is no doubt that Roaccutane has changed many acne sufferers' lives for the better. But the drug - a vitamin A derivative known as a retenoid - is facing legal actions worldwide from patients who claim to have suffered severe depression or attempted suicide while on it. Claims are being prepared in Britain and Ireland. The European Union is also 'aware there are problems'. </p> <p>Britain's leading dermatol ogist, Dr Tony Chu, is concerned that the drug, which since 1982 has been administered to about 11 million people worldwide and last year took sales of more than \u00a3300m, is 'over-prescribed'. </p> <p>'My feeling is it's overused. It's like zap therapy but the relapse rate is about 50 percent.' </p> <p>Roche maintains that a suicide rate of 1.7 patients on Roaccutane per 100,000 is 10 times lower than the average suicide rate according to research by the Samaritans. </p> <p>'Psychiatric events reported in association with Roaccutane therapy reflect the multiple risk factors in the population of adolescent and young adults afflicted with the disfiguring disease of acne,' the company said. </p> <p>It added: 'Roche takes issues of safety very seriously and is diligent in monitoring the safety of all its medicines.' </p> <p>But for those who take Roaccutane, the 'associated' psychiatric risks of the drug, which are now spelt out in a special warning when it is prescribed, is all they need. </p> <p><strong>What is acne?</strong></p> <p>ACNE is an inflammatory skin disease. It affects the tiny pores which cover the face, arms, back and chest and the oil glands attached to them. </p> <p>It is caused by an excessive response by grease glands under the skin to sex hormones which partially blocks pores, restricts the flow of oil on to the skin and results in solidification of the oil which causes blackheads. </p> <p>If the blockage becomes complete, oil builds up around the hair. </p> <p>The hair root then becomes infected with the bacteria normally present on skin. This bacteria breaks down the oil to inflammatory chemicals which causes redness and pus - the zit. </p> <p>The disease is normally self-limiting which is why, by the time the sufferer reaches 25, it has normally abated.</p> <p><strong>The skin game</strong> </p> <p>Total UK acne spend: \u00a364m </p> <p><strong>Clean &amp; Clear (J&amp;J) 20% </strong> <br><strong>Oxy (SmithKline Beecham) 19% </strong> <br><strong>Clearasil (Boots) 15% </strong> <br><strong>Biactol (Boots) 7%</strong></p> <p>Source: Information Resources</p>",

Clare, who confirmed that similar consumer healthcare product acquisitions were on the cards, is intent on a massive Clearasil marketing push. The brands, he believes, stagnated under the ownership of Procter &amp; Gamble, which instead concentrated on its Olay beauty products. But in the week in which Body Shop boss Anita Roddick slammed anti-ageing creams as 'pap', there are many who fear that companies such as Boots and SmithKline Beecham, which makes the rival Oxy product, are making unrealistic claims for their brands. 'There are no overnight cures for acne,' said Acne Support Group chief executive, Alison Dudley. 'The old Clearasil ads showed the amount of dirt that comes off cotton wool thanks to Clearasil. The inference is that acne is caused by dirt. This is totally inaccurate. You cannot wash away spots. The blame doesn't lie with the products. It lies with the hazy, misleading messages. 'Kids are more likely to have less self-worth as increasingly people are aware of beauty and skin care. Airbrushed images in the media tell us we could and should have perfect skin and this is what these products are preying on.' Boots is adamant that it will take a responsible attitude to its advertising. It needs to. 'Pus Daddy' is the latest jibe meted out to those with acne by school kids increasingly obsessed with personal appearance. According to the British Association of Dermatologists, 85 per cent of the population suffer from acne at some point in their youth and 15 per cent have severe problems. The London-based Acne Support Group says that 15 per cent of those questioned in a recent survey felt suicidal as a result of the condition. But those with acne are often too embarrassed to talk to a doctor. And if they do, they are usually fobbed off with a pat 'it'll pass' response. By the age of 25, it usually does. But the disease, for which there are no cures - just treatments - is regarded as trivial. 'The market has been talking down to the customer,' admitted Clare. However, in the reclusive world of spot sufferers there are more pressing fears. Last month the US Food and Drug Administration met to discuss whether to restrict the use of the anti-acne drug Roaccutane, produced by Swiss-firm Roche Products. The drug has been 'associated' with depression and even suicide. America's FDA decided against restricting it, but demanded that Roche compile a register of all those prescribed the drug, which is taken by mouth and can cause birth defects in the offspring of women pregnant while taking the drug. The FDA continues to monitor the situation and a spokeswoman said: 'There's enough evidence to indicate an association [with psychiatric disorders] but not enough to suggest a causal link.' There is no doubt that Roaccutane has changed many acne sufferers' lives for the better. But the drug - a vitamin A derivative known as a retenoid - is facing legal actions worldwide from patients who claim to have suffered severe depression or attempted suicide while on it. Claims are being prepared in Britain and Ireland. The European Union is also 'aware there are problems'. Britain's leading dermatol ogist, Dr Tony Chu, is concerned that the drug, which since 1982 has been administered to about 11 million people worldwide and last year took sales of more than \u00a3300m, is 'over-prescribed'. 'My feeling is it's overused. It's like zap therapy but the relapse rate is about 50 percent.' Roche maintains that a suicide rate of 1.7 patients on Roaccutane per 100,000 is 10 times lower than the average suicide rate according to research by the Samaritans. 'Psychiatric events reported in association with Roaccutane therapy reflect the multiple risk factors in the population of adolescent and young adults afflicted with the disfiguring disease of acne,' the company said. It added: 'Roche takes issues of safety very seriously and is diligent in monitoring the safety of all its medicines.' But for those who take Roaccutane, the 'associated' psychiatric risks of the drug, which are now spelt out in a special warning when it is prescribed, is all they need. What is acne? ACNE is an inflammatory skin disease. It affects the tiny pores which cover the face, arms, back and chest and the oil glands attached to them. It is caused by an excessive response by grease glands under the skin to sex hormones which partially blocks pores, restricts the flow of oil on to the skin and results in solidification of the oil which causes blackheads. If the blockage becomes complete, oil builds up around the hair. The hair root then becomes infected with the bacteria normally present on skin. This bacteria breaks down the oil to inflammatory chemicals which causes redness and pus - the zit. The disease is normally self-limiting which is why, by the time the sufferer reaches 25, it has normally abated. The skin game Total UK acne spend: \u00a364m Clean &amp; Clear (J&amp;J) 20% Oxy (SmithKline Beecham) 19% Clearasil (Boots) 15% Biactol (Boots) 7% Source: Information Resources",

      "body": "<p>There is a billboard on the road from the airport into San Francisco. It says, 'Capitalism served fresh daily. Welcome to San Francisco.' You can get the best food in the world in the city of the Golden Gate. It is on the edge of the garden of America and has the pick of the nation's gastronomic treasures: fresh fruit and vegetables, magnificent wines and limitless seafood.</p> <p>When I arrived, a Gay Pride march was clogging up the city and, to escape the pinkness and insanity on the streets, I went for an early supper at Boulevard on Mission Street. I was enjoying the Spit Roasted All-natural Free Range Pork Loin, Saut\u00e9ed Sweet White Corn, Autumn Squash Bread Pudding, Mashed Potatoes and Cider Sauce, when I spotted a party of Brits on a nearby table. I knew they were Brits because they were pinching food off each other's dishes.</p> <p>Well, one thing led to another and I sat down with them and had a glass of wine. Turned out they were from Marks &amp; Spencer and had come to California to 'research' a range of healthy salads. There were a couple of food technologists, Wyn, a product developer, and Trevor, a production expert from Geest, which makes M&amp;S salads. 'We're going to see Sandy the Salad Lady in the morning,' said Wyn. 'Why don't you come along?'</p> <p>I had less than nothing to do and so it came to pass that, early the following day, we drove across the Bay Bridge to Oakland and found Sandy Sonnerfelt, covered in flour and shouting orders in a bustling corner shop in the Market Hall. While the women started rooting around and selecting salads from the vast selection being laid out beneath the counter, I took Sandy for a coffee. She specialises in pasta and charcuterie and has a large salads cabinet and shelves groaning with delicacies. Sandy is South African and came to the US via an Israeli Kibbutz, where she had been feeding 700 people three times a day. En route to California, she stopped off in Jerusalem and learned to make ravioli and pasta in a restaurant called Mama Mia. 'We experiment a lot,' she says, 'intensive flavours, salsa, quince paste, pastas, cheeses, roasted aubergines, different oils and vinegars, pulses, rice, couscous, fruit and new types of leaf. We make more than 30 types of salad every day and bring in new recipes all the time.'</p> <p>By the time we returned to the shop, my new friends were furtively loading up their hire car with bags of salads and were ready to move on to a supermarket called Andronica's, which was more showbiz than shop. Lots of noise, music, sampling; salads presented in a wooden display cabinet stretching the length of the building, with sushi, complete entr\u00e9es, grain salads, savoury side salads and fresh food everywhere in great abundance.</p> <p>The huge fruit and vegetable display was kept fresh with an automatic spray. I was briefed by a staff member about the 17 different varieties of tomato including the fat, delicious 'Mortgage Lifter' from Fat Belly Farms. There were no sullen teenagers on the checkouts. My companions walked around with their cameras, taking pictures of anything that caught their eye and trying to avoid the staff, who understandably get shirty when the opposition turns up.</p> <p>The Californians eat early and by midday we were taking lunch in a restaurant called Viognier in the Draegers supermarket in San Mateo. Food shops often have their own restaurants and the food served here was the antithesis of the nosh served up at your neighbourhood Tesco. My thick turkey sandwich with avocado and mango salsa was all I could manage, but the menu of salads and deep-filled sandwiches was original and inexpensive. The towns around the Bay area are where you should go for lunch when you come to San Francisco, and, anyway, the weather's better.</p> <p>By evening, we had visited 10 stores and acquired dozens of cartons of food. Back in the hotel, they were taken upstairs to Wyn's room and arranged on the bed while the women and Trevor the chef poked at them with forks. Each sample was tasted and discussed, the ingredients were listed and the labels filed. Regulations prohibit importation of fresh food into the UK, so it was the ideas they were after. 'Have you tried this one?, asked Wyn. 'That's hummus.' Well, I couldn't look another paste in the face and I was due to fly home the next day, so I left the team behind to carry on with their exploration of the Californian food industry.</p> <p>I called Wyn up a couple of weeks after I came home and she said that the Californian-style salads were already on sale.

      "bodyText": "There is a billboard on the road from the airport into San Francisco. It says, 'Capitalism served fresh daily. Welcome to San Francisco.' You can get the best food in the world in the city of the Golden Gate. It is on the edge of the garden of America and has the pick of the nation's gastronomic treasures: fresh fruit and vegetables, magnificent wines and limitless seafood. When I arrived, a Gay Pride march was clogging up the city and, to escape the pinkness and insanity on the streets, I went for an early supper at Boulevard on Mission Street. I was enjoying the Spit Roasted All-natural Free Range Pork Loin, Saut\u00e9ed Sweet White Corn, Autumn Squash Bread Pudding, Mashed Potatoes and Cider Sauce, when I spotted a party of Brits on a nearby table. I knew they were Brits because they were pinching food off each other's dishes. Well, one thing led to another and I sat down with them and had a glass of wine. Turned out they were from Marks &amp; Spencer and had come to California to 'research' a range of healthy salads. There were a couple of food technologists, Wyn, a product developer, and Trevor, a production expert from Geest, which makes M&amp;S salads. 'We're going to see Sandy the Salad Lady in the morning,' said Wyn. 'Why don't you come along?' I had less than nothing to do and so it came to pass that, early the following day, we drove across the Bay Bridge to Oakland and found Sandy Sonnerfelt, covered in flour and shouting orders in a bustling corner shop in the Market Hall. While the women started rooting around and selecting salads from the vast selection being laid out beneath the counter, I took Sandy for a coffee. She specialises in pasta and charcuterie and has a large salads cabinet and shelves groaning with delicacies. Sandy is South African and came to the US via an Israeli Kibbutz, where she had been feeding 700 people three times a day. En route to California, she stopped off in Jerusalem and learned to make ravioli and pasta in a restaurant called Mama Mia. 'We experiment a lot,' she says, 'intensive flavours, salsa, quince paste, pastas, cheeses, roasted aubergines, different oils and vinegars, pulses, rice, couscous, fruit and new types of leaf. We make more than 30 types of salad every day and bring in new recipes all the time.' By the time we returned to the shop, my new friends were furtively loading up their hire car with bags of salads and were ready to move on to a supermarket called Andronica's, which was more showbiz than shop. Lots of noise, music, sampling; salads presented in a wooden display cabinet stretching the length of the building, with sushi, complete entr\u00e9es, grain salads, savoury side salads and fresh food everywhere in great abundance. The huge fruit and vegetable display was kept fresh with an automatic spray. I was briefed by a staff member about the 17 different varieties of tomato including the fat, delicious 'Mortgage Lifter' from Fat Belly Farms. There were no sullen teenagers on the checkouts. My companions walked around with their cameras, taking pictures of anything that caught their eye and trying to avoid the staff, who understandably get shirty when the opposition turns up. The Californians eat early and by midday we were taking lunch in a restaurant called Viognier in the Draegers supermarket in San Mateo. Food shops often have their own restaurants and the food served here was the antithesis of the nosh served up at your neighbourhood Tesco. My thick turkey sandwich with avocado and mango salsa was all I could manage, but the menu of salads and deep-filled sandwiches was original and inexpensive. The towns around the Bay area are where you should go for lunch when you come to San Francisco, and, anyway, the weather's better. By evening, we had visited 10 stores and acquired dozens of cartons of food. Back in the hotel, they were taken upstairs to Wyn's room and arranged on the bed while the women and Trevor the chef poked at them with forks. Each sample was tasted and discussed, the ingredients were listed and the labels filed. Regulations prohibit importation of fresh food into the UK, so it was the ideas they were after. 'Have you tried this one?, asked Wyn. 'That's hummus.' Well, I couldn't look another paste in the face and I was due to fly home the next day, so I left the team behind to carry on with their exploration of the Californian food industry. I called Wyn up a couple of weeks after I came home and she said that the Californian-style salads were already on sale. There's a Tuscan-style Bean in Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar Dressing, Potato Salad made to a California 'Deli' recipe and dozens of others.' The fact that they were inspired by Sandy's salads doesn't rate a mention on the labels, but what the hell, we live in an enterprise economy and there's no copyright on food. Anyway, however many West Coast recipes we conjure up, it will be years before British food stores can even begin to be as fun and friendly as they are in California.

      "byline": "Matthew Collings",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Two things occurred to me, when I read the news that Tate Britain is putting on a William Blake blockbuster, the biggest show of Blake there has ever been, opening 9 November. The first was surprise at the idea that the exhibition is somehow supposed to confirm this mad, old, paranoid, wild man's continuing relevance for 'the modern art of today'. </p> <p>This led to my second thought, which is that because I usually write about today's art, I hardly ever think about William Blake. His sincerity and propensity to experience visions always seemed to separate him for me from anything today's art is supposed to be about. I might have added his name to a list of influences on Chris Ofili's paintings once or twice in some articles, but that's only because this is an accepted bit of hyping, it's not something anyone's expected to stop and think about. </p> <p>I like today's art, of course, and feel connected to it, but not because it's about anything deep or because it has the feel of something important. It's likeable because it's about the shallow concerns everyone has today. Blake, on the other hand, was against anything anyone else thought, unless they were mythological, biblical, or from an imagined lost ancient past. </p> <p>He was tormented and had inner conflicts, and his great vast idea-systems and his anguish over good and evil and heaven and hell produced works that obviously are nothing but deep, and there can only ever be a clanging ring of profundity about them for us. Even though visually he's not particularly lovely or pleasing. He called other engravers he had known as apprentices and who set up engraving shops at the same time he did, 'lumps of ignorance', but their style wasn't all that different to his. It's his intensity that makes him different. He believed his art was divinely inspired. </p> <p>Today's art isn't about intensity on any level and no one expects it to be. It's based on an absorbed or picked-up-from-the-air-when-still-a-student structuralist idea of creativity, vaguely scientific or science-revering, shunning anything soulful or beyond reason. When art produced from this mind-set is irrational, the irrationalism is silly rather than divine. The art has shocks to make it noticeable, and the shocks are often funny, or at least they make sense. Anyone can get this art, after the initial jarring feeling. </p> <p>Sensation art, or Apocalypse or Intelligence or Turner Prize art is based on a formula where something looks startling at first and then turns out to be expressing some kind of banal idea, which somebody will be sure to tell you about. The ideas are never important or even really ideas, more notions, like the notions in advertising. Nobody pursues them anyway, because there's nothing there to pursue. It would be like pursuing the ideas in Snatch or Essex Boys . Today's art is a kind of hell, one Blake could never have imagined, even though he seems to have imagined everything - a multitude of vivid hells and heavens. </p> <p>Mainly, Blake imagined great legends of existence, based more or less on his own inner torments. One of them was that he felt guilty that he couldn't love his father, even though his father was very loving toward him. He experienced parental love as oppression. He later wrote poems about the tyrannical power of parents and the trials of children. But, in fact, his parents were amazingly supportive of him as a child, when he was shockingly badly behaved. Blake was lucky enough to have been born when a new idea about children had just taken hold: they were individuals who evolved slowly, not little adults - that is, not essentially already formed and just waiting to grow bigger. He didn't want to go to school, and his parents said he didn't have to. His mother taught him to read and write at home, instead. He 'detested blows', so they never gave him any. His father, who wasn't rich, gave him money to buy prints by Michelangelo and Raphael when he was still a teenager. He cried when he told another artist once, when he was very old, how impressed he was by the story of the prodigal son. </p> <p>I admire today's art, of course, but I would never say it was anything but a masquerade kind of art. I always assume its audience thinks this, too, and I'm surprised when they don't. Nothing personal can exist in it, and the notion of torment is just a spin for press releases. In fact, wherever there might be points of connection between our art and Blake's, it turns out to be a cul-de-sac. He was mad and Tracey Emin is mad. He was extreme and so is Damien Hirst. He was obsessive and the Chapman brother's model of hell in Apocalypse is obsessive. But Blake was apocalyptic and Apocalypse isn't. Blake was intelligent and Intelligence at the Tate wasn't. He would be too incomprehensible for the Turner Prize. He studied at the Royal Academy and rebelled against the Academy's principals. But the 21st-century Royal Academy, jolly, eclectic, ratings-obsessed, doesn't have any principals. </p> <p>Blake was in his forties when the 18th century ended. He lived another 30 years into the next century. His family had been lower-middle class. His father converted from Church of England to Baptism when Blake was a child. It was a mildly prosperous family. Baptism was like Methodism or Quakerism, it was thought to be a religion of the heart rather than a bit of social trickery designed to keep the poor down. Blake began seeing visions at a young age - he screamed at the sight of God passing the window when he was four. But initially it was his older brother John who had visions. John later gave them up and came to despise them, with William taking over the visionary role. Although Blake was coddled as a child, John was the favourite son. Blake later called him the Evil One. </p> <p>Blake married young and stayed faithful to his wife for 50 years. His writings are full of explorations of sexuality, sometimes verging on the pornographic. They're also full of anguish about sex and the eternal conflict between men and women. Catherine Blake died three years after him, and on her death bed called out to him as if he was in the other room, saying she was going to be joining him soon. They both believed in an afterlife. In fact, Blake believed in a before life as well. He believed it was in the before and after lives that his work was getting the top prizes. So he needn't worry about the now life. He once wrote: '... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are Studies and Chambers filled with books &amp; pictures of old, which I wrote &amp; painted in ages of Eternity long before my mortal life; and whose works are the delights and study of Archangels. Why, then, should I be anxious about the riches of fame or mortality? The Lord our Father will do for us &amp; with us according to his Divine will for our Good.' </p> <p>He lived through the rise of industrialisation, commercialisation and rationalism. He was against all three. He was for ancient knowledge, spiritualism and mysticism. He thought England was the thing, but not the same England everyone else lived in. The true England was sleeping, he was going to wake it up through poetry and art - England would be Jerusalem and angels and the great celebration and redemption, instead of tyranny and seediness. </p> <p>When he was young, there were riots over industrialisation. Then there were trials for treason. Mobs of patriots could turn on anyone considered to be anti-monarchist. There were laws against illegal assemblies. England was a much more paranoid nation than today, but also a much more aggressive one, which makes sense - aggressive colonial expansion overseas, paranoia at home - Blake was against war, as well as against the art of his time and everything else of his time. He was an outcast, but he seems always to have made an extra effort to cast himself out. He would be incredibly tiresome in our world. </p> <p>When he was 27, he fell out with a little artistic circle where, for a while, he was welcomed every week as an interesting eccentric. He sang his poems to the group and they liked it, but now he was against them. He wrote a satire that sent them all up cruelly, called an Island in the Moon . </p> <p>The characters included General Jacko, named after a famous performing monkey of the period, also Obtuse Angle, Inflammable Gass the Windfinder, Mrs Nannicantipot and Suction. They start out considering the Nature of Truth, but soon their discussion turns to madness. One of them recites a poem to the recently deceased Samuel Johnson which includes the verse: </p> <p> Aha to Doctor Johnson </p> <p>Said Scipio Africanus </p> <p>Lift up my Roman Petticoat </p> <p>And kiss my Roman Anus </p> <p>Blake was against chit-chat and politeness but today's modern art is the best friend of chit-chat. Blake created memorable monsters such as Nebuchadnezzar and the Ghost of a Flea. These are frightening images, inexplicable, full of darkness. They didn't bring Blake any success at all. Nebuchadnezzar is on all fours in a cave, with horny fingernails and the Ghost of a Flea is a scaly beast. They're sensational because they're intense, Gothic, a bit horrible and a bit over-wrought. Our own version of this is Sensation which was frequently Gothic and horrible and with a bit of darkness at every turn. But polite conversation today is at home with the idea Sensation ushered in - that art isn't profound, only mock profound.

      "bodyText": "Two things occurred to me, when I read the news that Tate Britain is putting on a William Blake blockbuster, the biggest show of Blake there has ever been, opening 9 November. The first was surprise at the idea that the exhibition is somehow supposed to confirm this mad, old, paranoid, wild man's continuing relevance for 'the modern art of today'. This led to my second thought, which is that because I usually write about today's art, I hardly ever think about William Blake. His sincerity and propensity to experience visions always seemed to separate him for me from anything today's art is supposed to be about. I might have added his name to a list of influences on Chris Ofili's paintings once or twice in some articles, but that's only because this is an accepted bit of hyping, it's not something anyone's expected to stop and think about. I like today's art, of course, and feel connected to it, but not because it's about anything deep or because it has the feel of something important. It's likeable because it's about the shallow concerns everyone has today. Blake, on the other hand, was against anything anyone else thought, unless they were mythological, biblical, or from an imagined lost ancient past. He was tormented and had inner conflicts, and his great vast idea-systems and his anguish over good and evil and heaven and hell produced works that obviously are nothing but deep, and there can only ever be a clanging ring of profundity about them for us. Even though visually he's not particularly lovely or pleasing. He called other engravers he had known as apprentices and who set up engraving shops at the same time he did, 'lumps of ignorance', but their style wasn't all that different to his. It's his intensity that makes him different. He believed his art was divinely inspired. Today's art isn't about intensity on any level and no one expects it to be. It's based on an absorbed or picked-up-from-the-air-when-still-a-student structuralist idea of creativity, vaguely scientific or science-revering, shunning anything soulful or beyond reason. When art produced from this mind-set is irrational, the irrationalism is silly rather than divine. The art has shocks to make it noticeable, and the shocks are often funny, or at least they make sense. Anyone can get this art, after the initial jarring feeling. Sensation art, or Apocalypse or Intelligence or Turner Prize art is based on a formula where something looks startling at first and then turns out to be expressing some kind of banal idea, which somebody will be sure to tell you about. The ideas are never important or even really ideas, more notions, like the notions in advertising. Nobody pursues them anyway, because there's nothing there to pursue. It would be like pursuing the ideas in Snatch or Essex Boys . Today's art is a kind of hell, one Blake could never have imagined, even though he seems to have imagined everything - a multitude of vivid hells and heavens. Mainly, Blake imagined great legends of existence, based more or less on his own inner torments. One of them was that he felt guilty that he couldn't love his father, even though his father was very loving toward him. He experienced parental love as oppression. He later wrote poems about the tyrannical power of parents and the trials of children. But, in fact, his parents were amazingly supportive of him as a child, when he was shockingly badly behaved. Blake was lucky enough to have been born when a new idea about children had just taken hold: they were individuals who evolved slowly, not little adults - that is, not essentially already formed and just waiting to grow bigger. He didn't want to go to school, and his parents said he didn't have to. His mother taught him to read and write at home, instead. He 'detested blows', so they never gave him any. His father, who wasn't rich, gave him money to buy prints by Michelangelo and Raphael when he was still a teenager. He cried when he told another artist once, when he was very old, how impressed he was by the story of the prodigal son. I admire today's art, of course, but I would never say it was anything but a masquerade kind of art. I always assume its audience thinks this, too, and I'm surprised when they don't. Nothing personal can exist in it, and the notion of torment is just a spin for press releases. In fact, wherever there might be points of connection between our art and Blake's, it turns out to be a cul-de-sac. He was mad and Tracey Emin is mad. He was extreme and so is Damien Hirst. He was obsessive and the Chapman brother's model of hell in Apocalypse is obsessive. But Blake was apocalyptic and Apocalypse isn't. Blake was intelligent and Intelligence at the Tate wasn't. He would be too incomprehensible for the Turner Prize. He studied at the Royal Academy and rebelled against the Academy's principals. But the 21st-century Royal Academy, jolly, eclectic, ratings-obsessed, doesn't have any principals. Blake was in his forties when the 18th century ended. He lived another 30 years into the next century. His family had been lower-middle class. His father converted from Church of England to Baptism when Blake was a child. It was a mildly prosperous family. Baptism was like Methodism or Quakerism, it was thought to be a religion of the heart rather than a bit of social trickery designed to keep the poor down. Blake began seeing visions at a young age - he screamed at the sight of God passing the window when he was four. But initially it was his older brother John who had visions. John later gave them up and came to despise them, with William taking over the visionary role. Although Blake was coddled as a child, John was the favourite son. Blake later called him the Evil One. Blake married young and stayed faithful to his wife for 50 years. His writings are full of explorations of sexuality, sometimes verging on the pornographic. They're also full of anguish about sex and the eternal conflict between men and women. Catherine Blake died three years after him, and on her death bed called out to him as if he was in the other room, saying she was going to be joining him soon. They both believed in an afterlife. In fact, Blake believed in a before life as well. He believed it was in the before and after lives that his work was getting the top prizes. So he needn't worry about the now life. He once wrote: '... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are Studies and Chambers filled with books &amp; pictures of old, which I wrote &amp; painted in ages of Eternity long before my mortal life; and whose works are the delights and study of Archangels. Why, then, should I be anxious about the riches of fame or mortality? The Lord our Father will do for us &amp; with us according to his Divine will for our Good.' He lived through the rise of industrialisation, commercialisation and rationalism. He was against all three. He was for ancient knowledge, spiritualism and mysticism. He thought England was the thing, but not the same England everyone else lived in. The true England was sleeping, he was going to wake it up through poetry and art - England would be Jerusalem and angels and the great celebration and redemption, instead of tyranny and seediness. When he was young, there were riots over industrialisation. Then there were trials for treason. Mobs of patriots could turn on anyone considered to be anti-monarchist. There were laws against illegal assemblies. England was a much more paranoid nation than today, but also a much more aggressive one, which makes sense - aggressive colonial expansion overseas, paranoia at home - Blake was against war, as well as against the art of his time and everything else of his time. He was an outcast, but he seems always to have made an extra effort to cast himself out. He would be incredibly tiresome in our world. When he was 27, he fell out with a little artistic circle where, for a while, he was welcomed every week as an interesting eccentric. He sang his poems to the group and they liked it, but now he was against them. He wrote a satire that sent them all up cruelly, called an Island in the Moon . The characters included General Jacko, named after a famous performing monkey of the period, also Obtuse Angle, Inflammable Gass the Windfinder, Mrs Nannicantipot and Suction. They start out considering the Nature of Truth, but soon their discussion turns to madness. One of them recites a poem to the recently deceased Samuel Johnson which includes the verse: Aha to Doctor Johnson Said Scipio Africanus Lift up my Roman Petticoat And kiss my Roman Anus Blake was against chit-chat and politeness but today's modern art is the best friend of chit-chat. Blake created memorable monsters such as Nebuchadnezzar and the Ghost of a Flea. These are frightening images, inexplicable, full of darkness. They didn't bring Blake any success at all. Nebuchadnezzar is on all fours in a cave, with horny fingernails and the Ghost of a Flea is a scaly beast. They're sensational because they're intense, Gothic, a bit horrible and a bit over-wrought. Our own version of this is Sensation which was frequently Gothic and horrible and with a bit of darkness at every turn. But polite conversation today is at home with the idea Sensation ushered in - that art isn't profound, only mock profound. The only the thing it has to be is profoundly successful, which Blake never was. He could never get his art over to a popular audience, although it was always intended to be popular. He stayed poor throughout his life. He had a patron, William Hayley, who supported him for a few years but also caused him torment. At first, Blake idealised the relationship (he said the little cottage in the country Hayley got for Blake and his wife to live in was 'a place fit for immortals'), then when reality set in he became wrathful and fierce toward Hayley. (He realised Hayley condescended to him and thought Cowper, a much more famous poet than Blake who Hayley also patronised, was much more important.) Artists today have Charles Saatchi as their patron, but they don't have any illusions about what's going on there. Saatchi is naturally money and success-orientated, just as the artists are. When he occasionally sells their stuff off to make a profit, they might get a bit rageful, but that's only because it diminishes their success. Not because they loath commerce. In Saatchi's wrangles and dealings obviously everything is absolutely harmless and no one's committing any crime. After all, it's just how life is today and it's even part of the excitement of the art - will it make it? Will it fail? Will it get high prices at auction? Will it be on TV? Except in Blake's understanding of art and its connection to God and the angels, both Saatchi and the artist would be criminals. This is harsh for our age, mad even.

I like my food, but I'm not too fussed whether it arrives or not. </p> <p>A condition almost certainly developed while spending five formative years at an institution where the prefects made the porridge at breakfast, lunch was a questionable feast and high tea consisted of a re-heated stew made from last week's cricket sandwiches. Presented with such a diet, you pretty soon learned to disassociate meal-times from eating. This condition was probably exacerbated when I wholeheartedly took up smoking. The dedicated smoker presents a considerable challenge to the eager-to-please chef, for they are liable to look at the food on their plate and decide, 'I'd rather have a Marlboro.' </p> <p>In short, then, when your regular correspondent strides in to a restaurant, the owners are concerned he might devour everything on the menu, whereas when I shuffle in, looking like the advance man for a famine, they fret I might not eat a thing. To counter-balance this, and to maintain domestic harmony, I invited my wife, Grainne, to accompany me. When we first met, Grainne had an impeccable foodie pedigree. She was working for Tory puppet AWT (Anthony Worrall Thompson) and going out with the matre d' at all-round muppet MPW's (Marco Pierre White) flagship, indeed only, restaurant, Harvey's. Time after time, our long courtship was interrupted by young French lads fresh out of Dijon - the place, not the mustard, obviously - appearing at Grainne's house in tears after a hard night in Mr White's kitchen. She would offer solace and they would offer to take her to Michelin-starred restaurants. Pretty soon she could distinguish her Michel from her Albert Roux and my days of thinking I could palm a date off with an 'anything you want, darling' meal at Pizza Express were over. </p> <p>Our first target was Chameleon House, Harleston, Norfolk. And it was an important one. We had moved near there a month ago, and as far as we could discern, it was the only interesting restaurant within walking distance. That is to say the only restaurant where we could both have a drink. If it didn't stack up and we went out once a week for the next 10 years, say, to Norwich - \u00a320 cab there, \u00a320 cab back - I was staring at a \u00a320,000 taxi bill. Thankfully, it did. Our starters were excellent. Grainne opted for the spring rolls with ginger and crab, which she pronounced as 'very gingery and very crabby', while I chose the timbale of couscous with tiger prawns, coriander and lime. Normally, I'm suspicious of couscous. Too many dinner parties where the host has calculated that it will only cost him 20p a head to 'go Moroccan' and then paddled a lump of dry yet cloggy couscous on to everyone's plate. But this was a delight. </p> <p>The main courses were equally good. Grainne's pork loin with an apricot and sage stuffing and a red-onion confit was just the hearty fare required when it suddenly strikes you that at some stage you will have to embark on a half-hour cross-country hike, it's dark and it never crossed either of your minds to bring a torch. </p> <p>Less substantial, but even more mouth-watering, was my gratin of lobster. So good was this that at no stage did it cross my mind to light a cigarette. The wine - a Sauvignon and a Shiraz, a white and a red, have to try both - was as good as you get for 5p under \u00a315. The service was discreet. The coffee was the best I've had outside London. And the pudding (a mulberry parfait) - well, good enough to convince me I should start eating puddings again. </p> <p>All in all, the Chameleon was a revelation. My only concern is the clientele, or rather the lack of it. It was Friday night, yet the smallish restaurant wasn't as full as it deserved to be. Perhaps I should concede to demands to support the local Post Office on condition that others support their local restaurant.</p> <p>\u0095 Chameleon House, 3 Redenhall Road, Harleston, Norfolk (01379 852 243).

In short, then, when your regular correspondent strides in to a restaurant, the owners are concerned he might devour everything on the menu, whereas when I shuffle in, looking like the advance man for a famine, they fret I might not eat a thing. To counter-balance this, and to maintain domestic harmony, I invited my wife, Grainne, to accompany me. When we first met, Grainne had an impeccable foodie pedigree. She was working for Tory puppet AWT (Anthony Worrall Thompson) and going out with the matre d' at all-round muppet MPW's (Marco Pierre White) flagship, indeed only, restaurant, Harvey's. Time after time, our long courtship was interrupted by young French lads fresh out of Dijon - the place, not the mustard, obviously - appearing at Grainne's house in tears after a hard night in Mr White's kitchen. She would offer solace and they would offer to take her to Michelin-starred restaurants. Pretty soon she could distinguish her Michel from her Albert Roux and my days of thinking I could palm a date off with an 'anything you want, darling' meal at Pizza Express were over. Our first target was Chameleon House, Harleston, Norfolk. And it was an important one. We had moved near there a month ago, and as far as we could discern, it was the only interesting restaurant within walking distance. That is to say the only restaurant where we could both have a drink. If it didn't stack up and we went out once a week for the next 10 years, say, to Norwich - \u00a320 cab there, \u00a320 cab back - I was staring at a \u00a320,000 taxi bill. Thankfully, it did. Our starters were excellent. Grainne opted for the spring rolls with ginger and crab, which she pronounced as 'very gingery and very crabby', while I chose the timbale of couscous with tiger prawns, coriander and lime. Normally, I'm suspicious of couscous. Too many dinner parties where the host has calculated that it will only cost him 20p a head to 'go Moroccan' and then paddled a lump of dry yet cloggy couscous on to everyone's plate. But this was a delight. The main courses were equally good. Grainne's pork loin with an apricot and sage stuffing and a red-onion confit was just the hearty fare required when it suddenly strikes you that at some stage you will have to embark on a half-hour cross-country hike, it's dark and it never crossed either of your minds to bring a torch. Less substantial, but even more mouth-watering, was my gratin of lobster. So good was this that at no stage did it cross my mind to light a cigarette. The wine - a Sauvignon and a Shiraz, a white and a red, have to try both - was as good as you get for 5p under \u00a315. The service was discreet. The coffee was the best I've had outside London. And the pudding (a mulberry parfait) - well, good enough to convince me I should start eating puddings again. All in all, the Chameleon was a revelation. My only concern is the clientele, or rather the lack of it. It was Friday night, yet the smallish restaurant wasn't as full as it deserved to be. Perhaps I should concede to demands to support the local Post Office on condition that others support their local restaurant. \u0095 Chameleon House, 3 Redenhall Road, Harleston, Norfolk (01379 852 243). Dinner for two, including wine, \u00a380. Jay Rayner returns in two weeks.",

      "body": "<p>Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Deep breath. Try again. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Titchmarsh. Alan. Sex. God. Is... Nope. It's no good - I still can't make that leap of faith. But for all I know there might be women who believe Robin Cook is a sex god. Anyway, we have proof that Alan Titchmarsh is an SG because he says so himself and he is a far too nice a man to lie. </p> <p>Just the other day, on Ground Force, he announced, 'I'll have you know I'm the sexiest man on telly after George Clooney.' He didn't actually explain the basis for this statement because he was too busy toshing up a topiary peacock at the time, but I asked him afterwards, and he said it was from some television survey quoted in The Daily Telegraph. Elle magazine put him in a list of top 20 gorgeous hunks and Woman's Own included him in a feature on 'hidden heart-throbs'. Two years ago he was mobbed by women at a Gardeners' World live show in Birmingham - and not all old biddies either. So there you go. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. </p> <p>And he has now written not one, not two, but three novels in which quiet manly heroes stroll through life to a chorus of long-limbed lovelies going 'phwoar! Look at that sex god with the secateurs!' The eponymous hero of his first novel, Mr MacGregor, was 'a man whose looks and build would have been perfectly at home modelling rugged outdoor wear in a Racing Green catalogue.' See? Total sex god. The girls in his new novel, Animal Instincts, keep asking each other about the hero - 'Dishy?' 'Unbelievably.' 'Hunky?' 'You bet.' When one of them finally gets him in the hay, she looks at his 'broad chest, strong legs and muscular arms' and whispers, 'You're so beautiful.' </p> <p>I wouldn't actually call Alan Titchmarsh beautiful, but he is catalogue-handsome like his heroes, albeit several inches shorter. And he has proper man-of-the-soil blisters on his hands, which, he says, he acquired yesterday shifting six tonnes of topsoil in a howling gale for Ground Force. He reckons it's Ground Force that has made him a sex god - that and his novels, which show his sensitive side. But it was odd for it to happen so late in life (he is 51) because when he was younger no one fancied him. He thinks perhaps he's got sexier as he's got older, or at least more comfortable in himself. While we were having lunch in a restaurant in Kensington, two fans spotted him through the window and waved at him. One was a little boy - 'You see!' he said, 'even children watch Ground Force !' - the other was a smartly dressed middle-aged woman who kept tapping on the window and blowing kisses till I thought she was demented, but she turned out to be Anne Robinson. </p> <p>I reminded him that we'd met once before at the Literary Review Bad Sex awards, but this was not a very tactful subject to bring up. He won for a passage in Mr MacGregor: 'She planted moist, hot kisses all over his body. Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead as he became more entangled in the lissom limbs of this human boa constrictor. For fully 15 minutes their mutual passion heightened, with groans, sighs and liquid noises.'</p> <p>Titchmarsh didn't actually win, he reminds me - Sebastian Faulks did for Charlotte Gray - but Faulks chickened out of coming to the prize giving, so Titchmarsh got the prize. But just remembering it makes him tetchy. 'Oh, you grit your teeth and carry on - the one award that comes back to haunt you. It would be easier not to bother writing love scenes at all, just leave them out, stop when the bedroom door closes, but I think that's bottling out, and anyway I quite enjoy reading it. I don't labour it or name the parts but I like showing two people getting on.' </p> <p>And getting into their white fluffy towelling bathrobes, which is always the key moment in any Titchmarsh sex scene. You know it's going to be really steamy when the white bathrobes, white bathsheets and 'crisp' duvets come out - though crispness, come to think of it, is not a particularly desirable quality in a duvet. You'd imagine he'd worked all his life in a bedlinen department rather than a garden. Ah, but that's just it, he explains. 'Because I work in the muck all day, I like to be clean. Nothing grubby for me! Do you know,' he goes on, 'I hadn't realised I'd put a white bathrobe in this novel - isn't that terrible? - it just shows how your subconscious comes out. But doesn't everybody have a white towelling bathrobe?' Not necessarily - they come in all different colours. 'Oh no, it's got to be white. If you see someone wrapped up in a towel, and it's all white and clean and lovely, that's sensuous.' Not black? 'No, that's too kind of 60s isn't it? Black towel, black sheets - that's scary really.' I wondered if he associated white bathrobes with hotel sex, but he said indignantly no, he had a white bathrobe at home. And his wife, Alison? 'Er, she has a pale blue one.' </p> <p>It is time to stop teasing him and admit that I do actually enjoy his novels, in a Jilly Cooperish sort of way. They are always well-plotted, with likeable characters, and they have great descriptions of landscape and nature. In his latest novel, Animal Instincts, the hero buries his father in 'the stony cliff-top loam'. Could Martin Amis give you soil details like that, could Salman Rushdie? And the moral is very sweet - that we must all cultivate our own gardens or our own patch of countryside rather than telling other people what to do. But the book will probably upset some of his fans because it defends foxhunting - Titchmarsh's line is that although he'd never want to chase and kill an animal himself, hunting is a traditional part of country life and therefore should be preserved. </p> <p>Basically, though, all his novels are love stories, and it is rare to find a man writing such unabashedly romantic fiction. He says he didn't set out to do it: 'I just wanted to write stories, but the romantic side of me came to the fore. Without sounding posey, in a way you don't get to choose what you write - it comes out the way it's going to come out.' He knows he writes 'feel-good fiction' but that's fine by him - he never likes angst. 'My novels are meant to be a good romp. I know they're not intellectually challenging or seminal works!' </p> <p>He has already started on his fourth novel, which he says will be about a father-daughter relationship. He writes in the winter, when the television gardening season dies down, in a hut in his garden with 'Barleywood Yacht Club: Members Only' on the door. He is incredibly prolific. Apart from presenting two television series, Ground Force and Gardeners' World, he has written 36 gardening books, and has just signed up to write some more for the BBC, as well as writing three weekly and two monthly gardening columns. He also does occasional after-dinner speaking and personal appearances, though he says he deliberately sets his fee very high so he doesn't get too many of them, otherwise he'd be opening garden centres every weekend. And, of course, he gardens every day for real, not just for television. He says that he could give up television quite easily, but he could never not garden, he needs that daily contact with the soil. </p> <p>Sex god, gardener, novelist, television star. How did Alan Titchmarsh happen? I mean it's not a career he could have planned as a boy in Ilkley, Yorkshire, in the 50s because sex-god gardeners didn't exist. But he was passionate about gardening from a very early age - he built his first polythene greenhouse when he was 12. Was that normal in Ilkley? 'Oh no, it was odd. Boys were meant to kick a ball in the street or play with a cricket bat. But I had a mate in the street who was also keen on gardening, so that was good. And he said that when he grew up he was going to be a postman because you could do all your work in the morning and then garden all afternoon. But I said, \"I'm going to be a gardener because that's all I want to do\" - and I did . But Dad, being a plumber, hated gardening, and he told me why later - because as a child he was made to weed for his father and grandfather [who were both professional gardeners] and it put him off. I had no idea at that stage, but Dad had been the odd one out and I was just carrying on the family tradition.' </p> <p>He was useless at school and felt squashed all the time - he thinks because he was 'too much of an eager puppy'. He was always leaping up saying, 'I can do that' and the teachers were saying, 'Shut up, sit down.' Also, 'I was very small at school, 4ft nothing, and always called Titchymarsh. That was OK, I didn't used to go home and sob, but I didn't enjoy it. And I knew what I wanted to do, I knew where I wanted to go and I just knew I had to do it.' So he left school at 15, with just one O level in art, and went to work for Ilkley Parks Department. He recalls the humiliation of having to water hanging baskets while his former schoolmates walked by, but also the joy of working in the nursery where he was 'blissfully happy, focused'. </p> <p>Then he went to horticultural college and to Kew Gardens, where he did a three-year diploma course, and was then appointed training supervisor. It was a prestigious job, setting up training courses, and he had his own key to the gardens, and a briefcase with E II R embossed in gold. His office was King George III's dining room. But one day he found himself quietly banging his head on the wall because he was so bored. He says it was 'like a Road to Damascus experience' - he knew he was in the wrong job, and he knew he had to get out. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, his boss came in with the Gardener's Chronicle open at the situations-vacant page and said, 'Who do we know who's got a literary bent?' And Titchmarsh said, 'Me.' At that stage, the only evidence for his literary bent was the English O level he'd recently taken at nightclass, but anyway he applied for the job as gardening-books editor for Hamlyns, and got it. And when someone failed to deliver a book on greenhouse gardening, he wrote it himself, and then moved to become deputy editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. Meanwhile, in 1975, he married Alison, a dance and games teacher he met through the Barnes and Richmond amateur operatic society, and had two daughters, Polly and Camilla, now 19 and 17. They lived in a tiny two-up, two-down cottage in Sunningdale and were so hard up they sometimes had to hide on Fridays when the milkman came round for his money. </p> <p>So he was very pleased indeed when, in 1979, television beckoned. There was a sudden plague of greenfly on the south coast and he was sent to Margate to report for Nationwide . 'I suddenly tasted blood. It was God! Wow! Oh my God, I like this. I want to do more.' In fact, he had to wait a year for his next television summons, but soon he was spreading like ground elder, doing gardening spots for Breakfast Time , presenting Songs of Praise and a series called Open Air, and then doing his own chat show on Pebble Mill at One. For 10 years, he was the Wogan of lunchtime television - he interviewed everyone from Placido Domingo to Barry Manilow, from Bette Davis to Julia Roberts (he gave her one of his gardening books) - but I can't find anyone who recalls ever seeing any of his interviews. </p> <p> Was he any good as an interviewer? 'Yes I think I was quite good. I wasn't aggressive but I hope I wasn't bland. My aim during the course of a lunchtime interview was just to make the viewer's fork pause on its way to their lips.' It sounds rather a modest aim. Was he blander than Parky, blander than Wogan? The test would be if he could give a rough ride to, say, Thora Hird? 'Ah, but then the bottom line is, why would you want to? You can ask an aggressive question that makes you look good, but if you don't get an answer then it's a waste of time. And you can tickle trout can't you?' 'Not personally.' 'I mean, you can go down to the stream with a club and blast around in the water, which is the Paxman technique and extremely good for politicians, but I think there are other techniques. You can ease things out of people without being bland.' </p> <p>Hmm. It is often said that Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge was partly based on Titchmarsh, but Titchmarsh insists it couldn't be because 'I never wore pullovers like that.' But he recalls interviewing Steve Coogan several times on Pebble Mill at One before he was well known, so 'Perhaps I am like that really. I suppose he just regards me as a rather middle-of-the-road chat-show host - you're a great Aunt Sally for that kind of thing.' Victor Lewis-Smith once wrote that 'The five most debilitating words in the English language are 'Ladies and gentlemen - Alan Titchmarsh' and Titchmarsh has not forgotten it. 'The first time you get real criticism like that it wounds you for a week and you go around thinking \"This is the end of my career.\" So I wrote off to him, and he wrote me this grovelling apology and I really thought, \"Ugh, what a comeback.\" If you're going to say something like that, for goodness sake have the guts to stand up for it. So after that I just didn't bother.' </p> <p>He doesn't think he failed as an interviewer - after all, the programme ran for 10 years - but on the other hand it didn't lead to anything. Once,Wogan's producer took him out to lunch, but there was no follow-up call. Even now, he admits, 'I watch Michael Parkinson enviously and think I'd like to do that.' But after 10 years of chat-show hosting, it was back to gardening - luckily he'd kept his hand in by writing a gardening column for the Daily Mail - and he took over Gardeners' World when Geoff Hamilton died in 1996. 'So I was back out in the garden, really quite happily, having a breath of air. And then after a year of that, Ground Force came along and it was sort of stratospheric.' </p> <p> Ground Force really is stratospheric in television terms - it regularly attracts 12 million viewers and comes second only to EastEnders in the ratings. It started quietly on BBC2, but then shifted to BBC1 when the nation collectively fell in love with Charlie Dimmock. Titchmarsh once said apropos Dimmock that he sometimes felt like Prince Charles must have felt when the crowds kept asking 'Where's Princess Di?' Very galling, when he was the expert and supposedly the star. Was his nose put out of joint? 'No, you couldn't let it be, and she's such a sweetheart. But, of course, there is that initial reaction of \"Excuse me!\" But then you have to ask yourself, \"Do I want that kind of attention? Do I want to be photographed everywhere I go.\" And the answer is no, actually, because that's not my bag. And you know in the days when I started watching gardening programmes there was only Percy Thrower, and it's good to have a variety of folk pushing what to me is my life's passion.' </p> <p>All my serious gardening friends get very snooty about Ground Force - they loathe the idea that anyone can create a garden in two days, they hate all those 'features' and ready-grown plants. My colleague Monty Don argues that the trouble with any makeover programme is that it 'subverts and by-passes the rhythm of gardening, which is a huge part of the pleasure'. On the other hand, Monty admits that his children love Ground Force - although they hate gardening.</p> <p>Then there is the pebble question. No Ground Force garden is complete without its pebble path or 'feature' and conservationists worry that people go and nick them off the beaches. It would indeed be ironic if Britain is finally flooded, not by global warming, but because all our sea defences have been removed to make pebble features in patios. But I agree with Titchmarsh that if Ground Force inspires even just one per cent of its viewers to take up gardening, it will have added to the sum of human happiness. And there is convincing evidence that it has done that - the national spend on gardening has gone up by a third over the past two years. </p> <p>He believes that the English are still the best domestic gardeners in the world (though the Dutch are better at houseplants, and the French and Italians at formal gardens), but we need to work at keeping the tradition alive. That's why, much as he loves Ground Force , he believes Gardeners' World is more valuable, because it's teaching the old skills - how to dig, how to propagate, how to plant, how to prune - which are in danger of being lost. He will give up Ground Force before he gives up Gardeners' World . In fact, he hints he might give it up quite soon, maybe next year, because 'I really want to clear off while we're still at the top. I love doing it, I love enthusing people, I love showing my passion, but it takes a heck of a lot of energy, and I want to stay fresh doing it, I don't want to go off.' </p> <p>His books, his programmes, his novels have now made him a wealthy man, but he and Alison still live quite modestly. Their only big extravagance was building a 60-seater theatre on their house where they give occasional shows for charity and a Christmas entertainment for the village. They also have a 38ft trawler yacht down at Chichester, which they use to escape at weekends. He recently bought himself a Mazda MX5 'for my midlife crisis' but says his Puritan work ethic would stop him buying a Jaguar. His worst extravagance, he says, is buying old books on topography and he once paid \u00a31,000 for one, but that's as bad as it's ever got. And still his most treasured possession is the budding knife he was given on his first day at work in the Ilkley Parks Department. He still uses it on Gardeners' World . 'They don't make them any more - you can get other budding knives but they're not the same. It's perfectly balanced, it fits the hand well, it still keeps an edge, it's a proper professional budding knife. I remember being given it on my first day and it was pure heaven.' </p> <p>What seems odd to me is that he hasn't bought a bigger house and garden. He calls his home 'Barleywood' on television, but it is actually number 39 Beech Road or some such address, in one of those pseudo-country Hampshire dormitory villages so beloved by Pony Club girls. And although his garden is terribly long and, of course, beautifully tended, it is basically a narrow strip running very steeply uphill behind the house and partly overlooked by neighbours on either side. It has 'features' every few yards - everything from a gypsy caravan to a Japanese water garden - but it lacks the dreamy enclosed tranquillity of a proper English country garden. He says that gardens should reflect their owners' personality, and perhaps his reflects him - it is busy, cheery, extrovert, improved to within an inch of its life, with none of those dark, mouldy Freudian patches where sinister fungi thrive. </p> <p>Shyly, blushingly, like a virgin, I confessed that I have just this past year started gardening, and could he give me any tips? Yes, he said masterfully: well-rotted manure, Felco secateurs, and trust your instincts. He believes that most of us have more gardening nous than we know, 'Because it must be basic to us - it's what we did before we wore clothes, before we did anything else. But a lot of us have lost it over the years and we need to find it again. People are too frightened about planting, frightened they'll do something wrong, but there's a lovely line in Laurie Lee where he says his mother handled plants \"with a sort of slapdash love\" - and I think that's the thing, that sort of casualness, like a woman with 10 babies and she's giving one a bit of bread here and one a cuddle there - you need a feel for them.' And then I asked him what would grow under my oak tree and he wrote down three names - Rubus tricolor, Hypericum calycinum, Hedera hibernica - and I went home happy. What other sex god can give you that?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Deep breath. Try again. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. Titchmarsh. Alan. Sex. God. Is... Nope. It's no good - I still can't make that leap of faith. But for all I know there might be women who believe Robin Cook is a sex god. Anyway, we have proof that Alan Titchmarsh is an SG because he says so himself and he is a far too nice a man to lie. Just the other day, on Ground Force, he announced, 'I'll have you know I'm the sexiest man on telly after George Clooney.' He didn't actually explain the basis for this statement because he was too busy toshing up a topiary peacock at the time, but I asked him afterwards, and he said it was from some television survey quoted in The Daily Telegraph. Elle magazine put him in a list of top 20 gorgeous hunks and Woman's Own included him in a feature on 'hidden heart-throbs'. Two years ago he was mobbed by women at a Gardeners' World live show in Birmingham - and not all old biddies either. So there you go. Alan Titchmarsh is a sex god. And he has now written not one, not two, but three novels in which quiet manly heroes stroll through life to a chorus of long-limbed lovelies going 'phwoar! Look at that sex god with the secateurs!' The eponymous hero of his first novel, Mr MacGregor, was 'a man whose looks and build would have been perfectly at home modelling rugged outdoor wear in a Racing Green catalogue.' See? Total sex god. The girls in his new novel, Animal Instincts, keep asking each other about the hero - 'Dishy?' 'Unbelievably.' 'Hunky?' 'You bet.' When one of them finally gets him in the hay, she looks at his 'broad chest, strong legs and muscular arms' and whispers, 'You're so beautiful.' I wouldn't actually call Alan Titchmarsh beautiful, but he is catalogue-handsome like his heroes, albeit several inches shorter. And he has proper man-of-the-soil blisters on his hands, which, he says, he acquired yesterday shifting six tonnes of topsoil in a howling gale for Ground Force. He reckons it's Ground Force that has made him a sex god - that and his novels, which show his sensitive side. But it was odd for it to happen so late in life (he is 51) because when he was younger no one fancied him. He thinks perhaps he's got sexier as he's got older, or at least more comfortable in himself. While we were having lunch in a restaurant in Kensington, two fans spotted him through the window and waved at him. One was a little boy - 'You see!' he said, 'even children watch Ground Force !' - the other was a smartly dressed middle-aged woman who kept tapping on the window and blowing kisses till I thought she was demented, but she turned out to be Anne Robinson. I reminded him that we'd met once before at the Literary Review Bad Sex awards, but this was not a very tactful subject to bring up. He won for a passage in Mr MacGregor: 'She planted moist, hot kisses all over his body. Beads of sweat began to appear on Guy's forehead as he became more entangled in the lissom limbs of this human boa constrictor. For fully 15 minutes their mutual passion heightened, with groans, sighs and liquid noises.' Titchmarsh didn't actually win, he reminds me - Sebastian Faulks did for Charlotte Gray - but Faulks chickened out of coming to the prize giving, so Titchmarsh got the prize. But just remembering it makes him tetchy. 'Oh, you grit your teeth and carry on - the one award that comes back to haunt you. It would be easier not to bother writing love scenes at all, just leave them out, stop when the bedroom door closes, but I think that's bottling out, and anyway I quite enjoy reading it. I don't labour it or name the parts but I like showing two people getting on.' And getting into their white fluffy towelling bathrobes, which is always the key moment in any Titchmarsh sex scene. You know it's going to be really steamy when the white bathrobes, white bathsheets and 'crisp' duvets come out - though crispness, come to think of it, is not a particularly desirable quality in a duvet. You'd imagine he'd worked all his life in a bedlinen department rather than a garden. Ah, but that's just it, he explains. 'Because I work in the muck all day, I like to be clean. Nothing grubby for me! Do you know,' he goes on, 'I hadn't realised I'd put a white bathrobe in this novel - isn't that terrible? - it just shows how your subconscious comes out. But doesn't everybody have a white towelling bathrobe?' Not necessarily - they come in all different colours. 'Oh no, it's got to be white. If you see someone wrapped up in a towel, and it's all white and clean and lovely, that's sensuous.' Not black? 'No, that's too kind of 60s isn't it? Black towel, black sheets - that's scary really.' I wondered if he associated white bathrobes with hotel sex, but he said indignantly no, he had a white bathrobe at home. And his wife, Alison? 'Er, she has a pale blue one.' It is time to stop teasing him and admit that I do actually enjoy his novels, in a Jilly Cooperish sort of way. They are always well-plotted, with likeable characters, and they have great descriptions of landscape and nature. In his latest novel, Animal Instincts, the hero buries his father in 'the stony cliff-top loam'. Could Martin Amis give you soil details like that, could Salman Rushdie? And the moral is very sweet - that we must all cultivate our own gardens or our own patch of countryside rather than telling other people what to do. But the book will probably upset some of his fans because it defends foxhunting - Titchmarsh's line is that although he'd never want to chase and kill an animal himself, hunting is a traditional part of country life and therefore should be preserved. Basically, though, all his novels are love stories, and it is rare to find a man writing such unabashedly romantic fiction. He says he didn't set out to do it: 'I just wanted to write stories, but the romantic side of me came to the fore. Without sounding posey, in a way you don't get to choose what you write - it comes out the way it's going to come out.' He knows he writes 'feel-good fiction' but that's fine by him - he never likes angst. 'My novels are meant to be a good romp. I know they're not intellectually challenging or seminal works!' He has already started on his fourth novel, which he says will be about a father-daughter relationship. He writes in the winter, when the television gardening season dies down, in a hut in his garden with 'Barleywood Yacht Club: Members Only' on the door. He is incredibly prolific. Apart from presenting two television series, Ground Force and Gardeners' World, he has written 36 gardening books, and has just signed up to write some more for the BBC, as well as writing three weekly and two monthly gardening columns. He also does occasional after-dinner speaking and personal appearances, though he says he deliberately sets his fee very high so he doesn't get too many of them, otherwise he'd be opening garden centres every weekend. And, of course, he gardens every day for real, not just for television. He says that he could give up television quite easily, but he could never not garden, he needs that daily contact with the soil. Sex god, gardener, novelist, television star. How did Alan Titchmarsh happen? I mean it's not a career he could have planned as a boy in Ilkley, Yorkshire, in the 50s because sex-god gardeners didn't exist. But he was passionate about gardening from a very early age - he built his first polythene greenhouse when he was 12. Was that normal in Ilkley? 'Oh no, it was odd. Boys were meant to kick a ball in the street or play with a cricket bat. But I had a mate in the street who was also keen on gardening, so that was good. And he said that when he grew up he was going to be a postman because you could do all your work in the morning and then garden all afternoon. But I said, \"I'm going to be a gardener because that's all I want to do\" - and I did . But Dad, being a plumber, hated gardening, and he told me why later - because as a child he was made to weed for his father and grandfather [who were both professional gardeners] and it put him off. I had no idea at that stage, but Dad had been the odd one out and I was just carrying on the family tradition.' He was useless at school and felt squashed all the time - he thinks because he was 'too much of an eager puppy'. He was always leaping up saying, 'I can do that' and the teachers were saying, 'Shut up, sit down.' Also, 'I was very small at school, 4ft nothing, and always called Titchymarsh. That was OK, I didn't used to go home and sob, but I didn't enjoy it. And I knew what I wanted to do, I knew where I wanted to go and I just knew I had to do it.' So he left school at 15, with just one O level in art, and went to work for Ilkley Parks Department. He recalls the humiliation of having to water hanging baskets while his former schoolmates walked by, but also the joy of working in the nursery where he was 'blissfully happy, focused'. Then he went to horticultural college and to Kew Gardens, where he did a three-year diploma course, and was then appointed training supervisor. It was a prestigious job, setting up training courses, and he had his own key to the gardens, and a briefcase with E II R embossed in gold. His office was King George III's dining room. But one day he found himself quietly banging his head on the wall because he was so bored. He says it was 'like a Road to Damascus experience' - he knew he was in the wrong job, and he knew he had to get out. Soon afterwards, his boss came in with the Gardener's Chronicle open at the situations-vacant page and said, 'Who do we know who's got a literary bent?' And Titchmarsh said, 'Me.' At that stage, the only evidence for his literary bent was the English O level he'd recently taken at nightclass, but anyway he applied for the job as gardening-books editor for Hamlyns, and got it. And when someone failed to deliver a book on greenhouse gardening, he wrote it himself, and then moved to become deputy editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. Meanwhile, in 1975, he married Alison, a dance and games teacher he met through the Barnes and Richmond amateur operatic society, and had two daughters, Polly and Camilla, now 19 and 17. They lived in a tiny two-up, two-down cottage in Sunningdale and were so hard up they sometimes had to hide on Fridays when the milkman came round for his money. So he was very pleased indeed when, in 1979, television beckoned. There was a sudden plague of greenfly on the south coast and he was sent to Margate to report for Nationwide . 'I suddenly tasted blood. It was God! Wow! Oh my God, I like this. I want to do more.' In fact, he had to wait a year for his next television summons, but soon he was spreading like ground elder, doing gardening spots for Breakfast Time , presenting Songs of Praise and a series called Open Air, and then doing his own chat show on Pebble Mill at One. For 10 years, he was the Wogan of lunchtime television - he interviewed everyone from Placido Domingo to Barry Manilow, from Bette Davis to Julia Roberts (he gave her one of his gardening books) - but I can't find anyone who recalls ever seeing any of his interviews. Was he any good as an interviewer? 'Yes I think I was quite good. I wasn't aggressive but I hope I wasn't bland. My aim during the course of a lunchtime interview was just to make the viewer's fork pause on its way to their lips.' It sounds rather a modest aim. Was he blander than Parky, blander than Wogan? The test would be if he could give a rough ride to, say, Thora Hird? 'Ah, but then the bottom line is, why would you want to? You can ask an aggressive question that makes you look good, but if you don't get an answer then it's a waste of time. And you can tickle trout can't you?' 'Not personally.' 'I mean, you can go down to the stream with a club and blast around in the water, which is the Paxman technique and extremely good for politicians, but I think there are other techniques. You can ease things out of people without being bland.' Hmm. It is often said that Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge was partly based on Titchmarsh, but Titchmarsh insists it couldn't be because 'I never wore pullovers like that.' But he recalls interviewing Steve Coogan several times on Pebble Mill at One before he was well known, so 'Perhaps I am like that really. I suppose he just regards me as a rather middle-of-the-road chat-show host - you're a great Aunt Sally for that kind of thing.' Victor Lewis-Smith once wrote that 'The five most debilitating words in the English language are 'Ladies and gentlemen - Alan Titchmarsh' and Titchmarsh has not forgotten it. 'The first time you get real criticism like that it wounds you for a week and you go around thinking \"This is the end of my career.\" So I wrote off to him, and he wrote me this grovelling apology and I really thought, \"Ugh, what a comeback.\" If you're going to say something like that, for goodness sake have the guts to stand up for it. So after that I just didn't bother.' He doesn't think he failed as an interviewer - after all, the programme ran for 10 years - but on the other hand it didn't lead to anything. Once,Wogan's producer took him out to lunch, but there was no follow-up call. Even now, he admits, 'I watch Michael Parkinson enviously and think I'd like to do that.' But after 10 years of chat-show hosting, it was back to gardening - luckily he'd kept his hand in by writing a gardening column for the Daily Mail - and he took over Gardeners' World when Geoff Hamilton died in 1996. 'So I was back out in the garden, really quite happily, having a breath of air. And then after a year of that, Ground Force came along and it was sort of stratospheric.' Ground Force really is stratospheric in television terms - it regularly attracts 12 million viewers and comes second only to EastEnders in the ratings. It started quietly on BBC2, but then shifted to BBC1 when the nation collectively fell in love with Charlie Dimmock. Titchmarsh once said apropos Dimmock that he sometimes felt like Prince Charles must have felt when the crowds kept asking 'Where's Princess Di?' Very galling, when he was the expert and supposedly the star. Was his nose put out of joint? 'No, you couldn't let it be, and she's such a sweetheart. But, of course, there is that initial reaction of \"Excuse me!\" But then you have to ask yourself, \"Do I want that kind of attention? Do I want to be photographed everywhere I go.\" And the answer is no, actually, because that's not my bag. And you know in the days when I started watching gardening programmes there was only Percy Thrower, and it's good to have a variety of folk pushing what to me is my life's passion.' All my serious gardening friends get very snooty about Ground Force - they loathe the idea that anyone can create a garden in two days, they hate all those 'features' and ready-grown plants. My colleague Monty Don argues that the trouble with any makeover programme is that it 'subverts and by-passes the rhythm of gardening, which is a huge part of the pleasure'. On the other hand, Monty admits that his children love Ground Force - although they hate gardening. Then there is the pebble question. No Ground Force garden is complete without its pebble path or 'feature' and conservationists worry that people go and nick them off the beaches. It would indeed be ironic if Britain is finally flooded, not by global warming, but because all our sea defences have been removed to make pebble features in patios. But I agree with Titchmarsh that if Ground Force inspires even just one per cent of its viewers to take up gardening, it will have added to the sum of human happiness. And there is convincing evidence that it has done that - the national spend on gardening has gone up by a third over the past two years. He believes that the English are still the best domestic gardeners in the world (though the Dutch are better at houseplants, and the French and Italians at formal gardens), but we need to work at keeping the tradition alive. That's why, much as he loves Ground Force , he believes Gardeners' World is more valuable, because it's teaching the old skills - how to dig, how to propagate, how to plant, how to prune - which are in danger of being lost. He will give up Ground Force before he gives up Gardeners' World . In fact, he hints he might give it up quite soon, maybe next year, because 'I really want to clear off while we're still at the top. I love doing it, I love enthusing people, I love showing my passion, but it takes a heck of a lot of energy, and I want to stay fresh doing it, I don't want to go off.' His books, his programmes, his novels have now made him a wealthy man, but he and Alison still live quite modestly. Their only big extravagance was building a 60-seater theatre on their house where they give occasional shows for charity and a Christmas entertainment for the village. They also have a 38ft trawler yacht down at Chichester, which they use to escape at weekends. He recently bought himself a Mazda MX5 'for my midlife crisis' but says his Puritan work ethic would stop him buying a Jaguar. His worst extravagance, he says, is buying old books on topography and he once paid \u00a31,000 for one, but that's as bad as it's ever got. And still his most treasured possession is the budding knife he was given on his first day at work in the Ilkley Parks Department. He still uses it on Gardeners' World . 'They don't make them any more - you can get other budding knives but they're not the same. It's perfectly balanced, it fits the hand well, it still keeps an edge, it's a proper professional budding knife. I remember being given it on my first day and it was pure heaven.' What seems odd to me is that he hasn't bought a bigger house and garden. He calls his home 'Barleywood' on television, but it is actually number 39 Beech Road or some such address, in one of those pseudo-country Hampshire dormitory villages so beloved by Pony Club girls. And although his garden is terribly long and, of course, beautifully tended, it is basically a narrow strip running very steeply uphill behind the house and partly overlooked by neighbours on either side.

Even to those of us for whom television output is of slightly more than passing interest, news about the News but with no news in it is, quite simply, no news at all. And it's not even the sort of 'no news' that can be interpreted as 'good news', either - it's just nada, zero, zilch news, whatever time it's on and however big the picture in the Guardian. </p> <p>Sorry, but I just can't get excited about numbers without a few noughts at the end. Indeed, the breaking story about the new-look News so completely failed to excite me into a state of indignation that I don't even remember whether it starred Michael Buerk or Peter Sissons in front of the logo with - gasp! - a big 10 on it, instead of - au revoir, farewell, adieu! - a nine. But I misread the mood of the nation and for that matter mine too: </p> <p>'Look at this! This doesn't work at all !' I found myself shouting, incandescent with Petit Chablis, transforming into the Victoria Meldrew of Maida Vale in the time it took to flick through all the terrestrial channels last Thursday night. 'You can't have Question Time right after the News and then turn over to BBC2 and find Newsnight 's on as well...' For close attention to the schedules had indeed revealed a mega-news tsunami: 10 pm, BBC1: The News, followed by regional news, followed by Question Time ; 10.30, BBC2: Newsnight; 11pm, ITV, News, followed at 11.20 by regional news; 11.30, Channel 4, the inaccurately-titled and not-funny-any-more would-be satirically news-orientated, The 11'OClock Show. And, on Channel 5, something called G-String Divas. </p> <p>So I take it all back. And, apparently, some other people not employed by the news media also care passionately about the timing of the BBC news. Farmers, in particular, are furious because, alongside the parents of small children, stressed executives, pensioners, shift workers and an infinite assortment of other habitual news-watchers, it's often lights out by 10. And though, on Monday night, Victor Meldrew and The Royle Family were the first benificiaries of the new BBC1 evening schedules, I don't think they would approve either. In fact, they'd probably agree with Jim Royle's preferred critical adjective - that it was 'shite'. </p> <p>The return of <strong>One Foot In The Grave</strong> to our screens was marked by the arrival of a giant television in Victor's bedroom, because, as Mrs Meldrew explained: 'Fifteen-inch and 50-inch sound very similar over the phone.' A 15-inch Lorraine Kelly discussing 'clenched colons' over breakfast would have been bad enough, but 50 inches-worth blew the subject out of all proportion. As Jim Royle observed 30 minutes later, there's an awful lot of 'shite' on terrestrial TV - and nowhere this week was there more shite than in the 60 minutes leading up to the debut of the 10 O'Clock News. In One Foot In The Grave, aside from Lorraine's irritable bowel syndrome and a fragrant scene set inside the lavatory of a Chinese restaurant, Meldrew also presented Angus Deayton's Patrick with some 'art' made from birdshite - Chris Ofili meets Jackson Pollock, via 'the rectum of a very nervous albatross'. While, later, in <strong>The Royle Family</strong>, baby David Keanu was breastfed, reluctantly, by Denise, much to Jim Royle's horror. </p> <p>'Da-ad! It's only natural!' </p> <p>'So's doing a crap, but you wouldn't do that in the lounge, would you?' Soon enough, however, baby David was having his nappy changed, by his father, Dave, on the coffee table, in front of Ready Steady Cook. 'When are you going to start changing a nappy, Denise?' asked Jim of his daughter. </p> <p>'No way. It smells of shite.' </p> <p>Later, during a predictably pointless discussion about baby David's dad's birthweight, Jim observed that he 'couldn't give two shiny shites about what weight Dave was as a baby!', thus speaking for all of us. Later still, contemplating the possibility of his son, Anthony, being homosexual, Jim was driven to observe that 'Elton John was married to a woman but he still drops anchor in poo bay!' </p> <p>The received critical wisdom is that The Royle Family, winner of shiteloads of plaudits and awards, is a creation of contemporary comic genius but, aside from last year's gently bathetic Christmas special, I have always found it depressing. At least when Meldrew rages, his rage is a recognisable by-product of a morally and ethically complex personality, albeit one whose interior tectonic plates have shifted permanently out of kilter with those of his peers, but the humour within The Royle Family comes from celebrating lives without any shred of moral conviction about anything at all. Thus, as an exercise in comic futility, however well-acted (and it is faultlessly performed), it can never amount to an emotional experience greater than the sum of its biological parts. Perhaps there's just a very thin line separating comedy 'shite!' from the old-fashioned sort of shite, but whenever I watch the Royles, I invariably feel like signing up for VSO or becoming a Samaritan or something, though usually I settle for a long, hot, heavily-scented bath. </p> <p>So it was a very anally-attentive sort of week. Shite, everywhere, with excrementally-driven plot developments in unexpected quarters. Perhaps comedy writers need to book in for a collective colonic. Channel 4's <strong>North Square</strong> is the latest TV Chambers of Horrors: the new 'not This Life', replete with youthful thrusting lawyers, thrusting youthfully. It has jaw-judderingly staccato dialogue (one little monologue by a female solicitor called Stevie was completely impenetrable), wobbly cameras, a trying-too-hard soundtrack (the Clash, Air) and several of those square-jawed pretty-boy characters who all look so similiar that it takes until at least the second commercial break before you can quite remember which is which, and why you ought to care. </p> <p>Though not a comedy, North Square had a shite scene, too, in which Ruth Millar, as the Chambers' new, sweetly naive legal pupil, Morag from Mull, sat on a lavatory, (white) knickers at half mast, before making her first court appearance to defend a murderer. The scene was one part McBeal to two parts Meldrew, though McBeal's lawyers tend to prefer using their lavatories for gossip or sex in order to create a comedy stink. Anyway, there was no paper in Morag's loo, so she used her scarf. It was a horrible scarf. </p> <p>Meanwhile, after last week's subtle declaration of affection (via his character, Bernard Black, reading a copy of The Observer), the fact that my secret, merely technically unrequited lover-cum-soulmate, Dylan Moran (proprietor of Channel 4's <strong>Black Books</strong>), failed to send me a coded message this week was, I think it's safe to assume, a coded message in itself because, Dylan, even your silence speaks volumes . While last Friday's plot, in which Bernard went to a dinner party and disgraced himself by defecating in the host's wicker chair (he probably even left the cushion up afterwards) reassured me that, though the screen has been smeared with distracting amounts of televisual shite all week, some of it smells so much sweeter than the rest. </p> <p>Take, for example, Jeremy Clarkson (you might have missed the return of his chat show, <strong>Clarkson</strong>, on Thursday, while caught in the news-scheduling maelstrom), whose ignorance about (and sneering lack of interest in) global warming were dismissed, decisively and hilariously, as so much gaseous greenhouse fodder by guest Jonathon Porritt. 'You was whupped!' said his next guest, Martin Clunes, gleefully - and though, like Clunes, Clarkson has just turned 40, only one of them still boasts a toddler's aptitude for talking shite.</p>",

When he fails to deliver the expected tip, she leans over and hisses: 'The judge did it', then stalks off. Giving away surprises and plot details of films is the chief subject of angry correspondence from readers to movie columnists, reminding them that they're really just reviewers and not critics. So the less said about Robert Zemeckis's suspense flick, <strong> What Lies Beneath</strong>, the better. </p> <p>Michelle Pfeiffer is a former professional cellist married to a brilliant scientist, Harrison Ford, and living in an idyllic house beside a Vermont lake that the local narrative conservancy authority has recently filled with red herrings. Their daughter goes off to college and empty-nester mom starts suspecting murder next door and experiencing strange goings-on in her own home. </p> <p>Is this a homage to Les Diaboliques and Rear Window? Is a poltergeist at work? Is Pfeiffer going nuts? Perhaps all three, perhaps none. I will not hint at what lies beneath, but merely say that it passes the time without being especially good of its kind. </p> <p>What Lies Beneath is, however, markedly superior to the week's other new offerings by American filmmakers. Both are triumphalist tales of young girls overcoming adversity to fulfil their ambitions. </p> <p>In the mildly amusing, faux -satirical <strong> Bring It On</strong>, Kirsten Dunst is elected captain of her San Diego high-school cheerleading team and guides them to the national finals organised by the UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association) at Daytona, Florida. Competitive cheerleading is a cut above professional arm-wrestling, but a little of it goes a long way. </p> <p>Piper Perabo, the exotically named star of <strong> Coyote Ugly</strong>, plays a working-class New Jersey girl who moves to a Manhattan tenement to pursue a career as a pop composer, gets a job as barmaid at the eponymous raunchy saloon, has an affair with a handsome Australian, overcomes her stage fright and becomes a star. </p> <p>It's trashy, sentimental stuff that is not redeemed by the presence of John Goodman as her father, a tollbooth attendant on the Jersey Turnpike. Awash with booze, which is served and consumed in unfeasible ways, the picture only attracts a '12' certificate. Had someone passed a joint, it would have been rated '15' at least. </p> <p>The two local movies are of little interest. The Anglo-German <strong> The Little Vampire </strong> is a moderate family entertainment starring Jonathan Lipnicki (from Jerry Maguire and Stuart Little) as a lonely American lad brought by his parents to a remote Scottish village. The area is haunted by vampires seeking an amulet that will free them from their twilight existence, and the intrepid young hero helps out. It's a little like, but much inferior to, the Nicolas Roeg film of Roald Dahl's The Witches. </p> <p>The oppressive <strong> Nasty Neighbours</strong> is adapted by Debbie Isitt from her own play and isn't family entertainment. This is like Death of a Salesman rewritten by Caroline Aherne and stars Ricky Tomlinson as Mr Peach, a middle-aged Midlands Willy Loman, at the end of his tether after losing his job as a pedlar of double-glazing. </p> <p>Unable to keep up his mortgage payments, insensitive to his wife's impending breakdown, insulted by his pregnant daughter, he has fantasies of emigrating to Australia and channels all his frustrations into a steadily escalating battle with an unpleasant, well-off young couple who move in next door. Homicidal madness beckons. </p> <p>Peach is a pathetic, loathsome character and Isitt can't decide whether to treat his life as tragedy or black comedy and hovers uncer tainly between both, waving a two-way bet in her hand. </p> <p>A pleasant minor surprise from France, <strong> Dr\u00f4le de F\u00e9lix</strong>, co-directed by Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, is a sweet-natured road movie tracing a hitchhiking journey from Dieppe to Marseilles undertaken by the handsome, half-Algerian gay, F\u00e9lix (Sami Bouajila), after his mother's death. </p> <p>His objective is to contact the father he's never met, and along the attractive route through Chartres and along the Rhne, he meets a succession of kindly folk, though in Rouen he witnesses a racial murder that he fails to report. </p> <p>It's sentimental, but not treacly and a nice mixture of the obvious and the surprising. The chief attraction is his encounter with an elderly widow in the Auvergne, played by the great cabaret singer, Patachou, looking splendid and full of character at the age of 82. </p> <p>Finally, two major re-issues, both courtesy of the British Film Institute. Pasolini's final film, <strong> Sal\u00f2</strong>, is an intentionally disgusting movie of considerable integrity and tedium, updating Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom to the dying days of Italian fascism. I can see no reason for it not to receive an '18' certificate from the BBFC, but I gained more from reading Gary Indiana's new monograph in the BFI Modern Classics series (\u00a38.99) than from seeing the film again. </p> <p>Made in 1959, set in 1929, Billy Wilder's <strong> Some Like It Hot</strong> enters this new century as fresh as ever. Beginning and ending with bloody massacres, it's perfectly constructed in three acts and is one of the three masterpieces produced by Wilder's partnership with I.A.L. Diamond (the other two are The Apartment and The Fortune Cookie). </p> <p>There is real danger threatening Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon; when they escape in drag, they're fleeing from ruthless mobsters, not trying to get in touch with their feminine sides. The picture's full of classic, much quoted lines and features smart, postmodern homages to other pictures ( Scarface, The Public Enemy, A Night at the Opera) which are directly commented on - of Tony Curtis's wild impersonation of Cary Grant, Lemmon remarks: 'Where did you get that phoney accent? No one talks like that.' </p> <p>The Florida beach scene is itself the subject of a homage in Stephen Frears's Prick Up Your Ears, and Curtis's comment about kissing Marilyn Monroe is now in reference books. Monroe gives her greatest comic performance here (though in Bus Stop and The Misfits she's more obviously poignant). </p> <p>Did I say, by the way, that it's funny? I can't think of anything funnier.</p>",

A pleasant minor surprise from France, Dr\u00f4le de F\u00e9lix, co-directed by Olivier Ducastel and Jacques Martineau, is a sweet-natured road movie tracing a hitchhiking journey from Dieppe to Marseilles undertaken by the handsome, half-Algerian gay, F\u00e9lix (Sami Bouajila), after his mother's death. His objective is to contact the father he's never met, and along the attractive route through Chartres and along the Rhne, he meets a succession of kindly folk, though in Rouen he witnesses a racial murder that he fails to report. It's sentimental, but not treacly and a nice mixture of the obvious and the surprising. The chief attraction is his encounter with an elderly widow in the Auvergne, played by the great cabaret singer, Patachou, looking splendid and full of character at the age of 82. Finally, two major re-issues, both courtesy of the British Film Institute. Pasolini's final film, Sal\u00f2, is an intentionally disgusting movie of considerable integrity and tedium, updating Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom to the dying days of Italian fascism. I can see no reason for it not to receive an '18' certificate from the BBFC, but I gained more from reading Gary Indiana's new monograph in the BFI Modern Classics series (\u00a38.99) than from seeing the film again. Made in 1959, set in 1929, Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot enters this new century as fresh as ever. Beginning and ending with bloody massacres, it's perfectly constructed in three acts and is one of the three masterpieces produced by Wilder's partnership with I.A.L. Diamond (the other two are The Apartment and The Fortune Cookie). There is real danger threatening Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon; when they escape in drag, they're fleeing from ruthless mobsters, not trying to get in touch with their feminine sides. The picture's full of classic, much quoted lines and features smart, postmodern homages to other pictures ( Scarface, The Public Enemy, A Night at the Opera) which are directly commented on - of Tony Curtis's wild impersonation of Cary Grant, Lemmon remarks: 'Where did you get that phoney accent? No one talks like that.' The Florida beach scene is itself the subject of a homage in Stephen Frears's Prick Up Your Ears, and Curtis's comment about kissing Marilyn Monroe is now in reference books. Monroe gives her greatest comic performance here (though in Bus Stop and The Misfits she's more obviously poignant). Did I say, by the way, that it's funny? I can't think of anything funnier.",

      "body": "<p>This we know: we're stressed-out, debt-ridden, exhausted. We have less time for our families than we feel we should have. We take fewer pleasures from our entertainments and consumptions than we expected to take. We feel less connected to our communities than we ever did. In our workplaces, we subject ourselves to routines and duties which at best seem pointless, at worst unethical or immoral. Yet we also feel like hollow citizens, too weary to respond to any political entreaty with anything other than a shrug. In short, we are workers.</p> <p>Yet why do we meekly accept this condition, when our brave new technological future - the amazing potential still to be unleashed in computers, genetics and molecular engineering - could change it utterly? Why, with all this power at our disposal, do we still feel like mere objects ourselves?</p> <p>But this is how the work ethic continues to grip us. It doesn't matter how many machines could do our more tedious mental and physical labours. Forget the promise of the future, or even the possibilities of the present. Too many of us still regard turning up for work, however dispiriting or futile, as the very mark of inclusion and legitimacy, the measure of our moral fibre. 'I put in the hours, therefore I am.'</p> <p>Anything beyond the steely certainties of the work ethic seem either frightening or flaky: the oblivion of no job, the insecurity of self-employment, the turpitude of domesticity. So the treadmill is wearily mounted, once again - in absence of any alternative vision. Yet why believe in work, when work doesn't believe in you?</p> <p>The constant watchwords of the new capitalism are flexibility, creativity, self-improvement. Workers are urged to 'get up to speed' with a runaway world: we must become mobile and tensile, enterprising and capable. Yet these injunctions come from companies which hire you for a year, six months, maybe even less; which might be taken over at any time; which try to wriggle out of long-term entanglements such as pensions, wage and holiday agreements; and which shed labour whenever there's a dip in the markets. Trying to excel for companies that are themselves transient, provisional and unforgiving will one day seem like the grandest folly.</p> <p>When that realisation comes - that is, when the work ethic crumbles - then an intellectual vacuum will open up at the heart of contemporary capitalism, and we'll need a Big Idea. Over the last decade, we've already seen a procession of not-big-enough ideas - 'downshifting', 'work-life balance', all those slackers and idlers. None of them with much success or distinction.</p> <p>They all try to speak to our deep common anxiety: that if we keep up our loyalty to the work ethic, in a world where competition, mutability and innovation rule supreme, we will destroy ourselves.</p> <p>The LSE's Richard Sennett calls this the 'corrosion of our characters' - where the acids of the new capitalism eat away at the old industrial virtues of self-discipline, sacrifice and duty.</p> <p>What we need is a new, similarly powerful social ethic for these hyper-demanding times. Some other world view that can give meaning to our busy lives. Something that could make all these demands for 'creativity' and 'achievement' worth the effort.</p> <p><b> I play, therefore I am</b></p> <p>Welcome to the play ethic. First of all, don't take 'play' to mean anything idle, wasteful or frivolous. The trivialisation of play was the work ethic's most lasting, and most regrettable achievement. This is 'play' as the great philosophers understood it: the experience of being an active, creative and fully autonomous person.</p> <p>The play ethic is about having the confidence to be spontaneous, creative and empathetic across every area of you life - in relationships, in the community, in your cultural life, as well as paid employment. It's about placing yourself, your passions and enthusiasms at the centre of your world.</p> <p>By clearing space for activities that are pleasurable, voluntary and imaginative - that is, for play - you'll have better memory, sharper reasoning and more optimism about the future. As Brian Sutton-Smith, the dean of Play Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, says, 'The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression. To play is to act out and be wilful, exultant and committed, as if one is assured of one's prospects.'</p> <p>So to call yourself a 'player', rather than a 'worker', is to immediately widen your conception of who you are and what you might be capable of doing. It is to dedicate yourself to realising your full human potential; to be active, not passive.</p> <p>The play ethic is what happens when the values of play become the foundation of a whole way of life. It turns us into more militant producers and more discriminating consumers. It causes us to re-prioritise the affairs of our hearts, to upgrade the quality of our emotional and social relationships. It makes us more activist in our politics, but less traditional in their expression. And most of all, the play ethic forces us to think deeply about how we should pursue our pleasures - and how we reconcile that with our social duties.</p> <p>So, just like the work ethic, the play ethic is a set of feelings and principles. But the difference between the two is huge. Work is always (to coin a phrase) the involuntary sector - the realm of necessity, where men and women have to do what they have to do. But as Sartre says, play is what you do when you feel at your most free, your most voluntary.</p> <p>When every positive decision you make about your life carries both a risk, and a promise, of something new and challenging taking place. This is why the play ethic isn't 'the leisure ethic': the last thing it involves is slumped relaxation.</p> <p>Ever since the 'Protestant ethic' achieved its dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries - making sure that workers turned up at the factory gates every morning - work has tried to keep play's unpredictable energies at bay.</p> <p>Play has been corralled into the pen of 'leisure' and 'entertainment' - the workers' playtime, where we undergo 'recreation' for the next day's grind. Or it has been infantilised as an immature state of being, a permissible excess in the young, which all serious adults must put behind them. Or play has erupted through the cracks of our well-managed lives, as a series of counter- culture movements in the West - from the beats to the hippies, from punks to the ravers, from 'no future' to 'no logo'.</p> <p>Yet it's only over the last half-decade or so that the conditions have been ripe for the values of play to assume their rightful place in modern life. This is the grand loosening-up of Western societies, under the pressures of feminism, market forces, and latterly our powerful new technologies. These pressures have untied all those constraints of class, gender and identity which secured our loyalty to the work ethic. Men and women now live in 'risk societies', where so many more choices and decisions have to be made about life. What do I need to survive? Is this safe to eat? Should I stay with this person? What am I going to do now?</p> <p>Never before in history have so many individuals felt so individualised. We are 'developing a feeling for freedom', in the words of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck. But the values of work throw a damp, heavy blanket over that development. The work ethic was always about battering down our responses, regimenting out behaviour - all those Christian inhibitions that were drilled into the 18th and 19th century worker, so that he could divide himself (and his labours) for the better workings of industry. Being a player, by contrast, is about the freedom to be inventive, nurturing and modern.</p> <p><b> Brave new office</b></p> <p>Why must we kill ourselves... for work? The play ethic is an attempt to kick-start a new conversation about how we bring creativity and dynamism into the heart of everyday life. We can start the conversation in one obvious place - with the overlords of the new capitalism, both in politics and business. Stop trying to corrode our characters, in Richard Sennett's words - and start helping us evolve and strengthen our characters.</p> <p>If we need to 'get up to speed', then give us the right kind of vehicle, with the best possible fuel, to accelerate. Don't use your powerful technologies to regiment and discipline us, to squeeze more work out of fewer numbers and discard the remainder: use them to liberate as many people as possible into lives of self-determined activity and increasing fulfilment. Treat us as players rather than workers, and the promise of this new century might well be realised. Believe in us, and we might believe in you.</p> <p>The play ethic holds out the chance that people can indeed increase their capacity to cope with this intrinsically demanding future. But if we're going to advance ourselves, we can't do it by ourselves. To be blunt, a world fit for players won't happen without a huge and visionary reinvestment in the public sector, and an even greater rethink of standard business practice - both taking the maximisation of human potential as their aim. Yet the movements in this direction so far have been pathetically inadequate.</p> <p>We need the kind of tax-and-spend policies which would frighten the horses of the Treasury (despite the fact that each of these ideas are well-represented in the mainstream media and politics of mainland Europe and Scandinavia).</p> <p>But that's not all. We'd need a welfare system that invested in and sustained our non-working lives, rather than distrusted and demonised them. And a powerfully comprehensive education system, funded way beyond current levels, aimed at establishing an 'intellectual democracy'. And an employment policy which set industry-wide targets for a progressive reduction of the working week to 35 hours, with no loss of pay.</p> <p>On this, the politics of the play ethic is unashamedly democratic. It's the majority of the population, not just the much-vaunted 'knowledge elites', who should get to be players. Reducing work hours is one way (among others) of sharing out the 'clever' jobs.</p> <p>And no one should doubt that employment will be getting cleverer and cleverer. As US technology critic Jeremy Rifkin says, the industries of the 21st century won't require a mass labour force. 'But they will require the best minds working together with very sophisticated software and wetware - computer and genetic technology. The Industrial Age ended slave labour. The biotech and infotech century is going to end mass wage labour. So what are we going to do with everybody?'</p> <p>'We don't have a social and political vision', continues Rifkin, 'that is powerful enough to match these new technologies. We can't imagine what human beings could do if they're not needed in the marketplace or for government service.'</p> <p>The play ethic is exactly that vision - an attempt to imagine what human beings could do under these coming conditions. Not slumped in front of the television, not lost in a narcotic stupor, not listless or apathetic or passive - but an imaginative, engaged and active citizenry. Active because motivated, and motivated because there is an intimate, enriching connection between who they really are, and what they actually do. In the words of Brian Sutton-Smith, 'Play as the action in which we truly live.'</p> <p><b> All power to the soulitariat!</b></p> <p>So who's playing right now? Has anyone escaped the bonds of the work ethic and broken through to the other side?</p> <p>At the beginning of this new century, the social group that seems to be playing for keeps is the digital generation. For them, play is naturally what you do with your world: there's no angst or self-loathing about it. The technology that hovers like an axe over the neck of the traditional worker is more like a toy for them - a means of empowerment, not exploitation. They've left for the Playstation, these screenagers and cybernauts, and they're never coming home. This is the generation that was allowed to download their lives for free - browsers for nothing, web-mail for nothing, bootlegged software for nothing. So they've already got a weird, almost dotcommunist sense of property rights, which subverts the work ethic at its core.</p> <p>When the Net-Gens graduate from college, and go to the job market, the first thing they do is play around with the idea of a career itself. As a recent Industrial Society report says, these 'free workers' also want to find an emotional content in the work they're doing. They wish to cut deals with employers that maximise their control of their time, their environment, their personal commitments. They don't believe that fun and pleasure should be confined to after-hours: they want it when they draw a wage as well.</p> <p>They are neither the yuppies of the 80s, nor the downshifters of the 90s. They are eager to take all the opportunities that the new network society can offer, but wise enough to realise that wage-labour is only one strand in their life stories.</p> <p>We've been struggling to describe them over these last few years - Gen-X to Gen-Y, alt.dots to screenagers. Let's risk another term, which tries to express their playful balancing of employment, environment and experience. The bearers of the play ethic, right at the heart of the new economy, are a different kind of worker: not proletarians, but 'soulitarians'. These are the backpackers of Alex Garland's The Beach , using cheap flights and travel literature to make the world their playground. These are the ravers who grew up, but who can't (and won't) forget those blissed-out moments of transcendence, when drugs and beats blurred the boundaries of their selves.</p> <p>Great experiences matter to soulitarians as much as cool commodities. In the late 50s, the radical historian EP Thompson anticipated this in his famous essay on Time and Industrial Capitalism . Musing on what a post-work society might be like, Thompson suggested that its rhythms might rely 'neither upon the seasons, nor upon the market, but upon human occasions'. Which has happened: the soulitarian is above all a connoisseur of 'human occasions', from festival to tourist trail, from anti-corporate carnival to urban hang out.</p> <p>True players wield a huge bargaining chip in their dealings with the new capitalism. They understand the core political fact of the knowledge economy: you need my brains, and my heart, and my willingness, more than I need your money and security.</p> <p>The soulitarians happily flit between start-up and corporation, self-employment and job-sharing, being paid in cash and being paid in kind. If and when they work, they work because they want to.</p> <p>The fact is that you don't have to be a dotcommer to be a player. It remains the case that almost everybody can be a soulitarian. The work ethic was essentially mind control: industry had to find a way to exploit the worker's body - so it had to tether his or her mind with a whole weight of guilt, shame and status. But now the worker's body is useless, replaced by ever smarter machines, industry is left with the workers' mind to exploit - and that's proving extremely difficult. For every time you ask a mind to reskill and upgrade, you make that mind more aware of its singular talents, subtler in its workings - and, therefore, more demanding about the life it wants to lead. The 'smart' workers are getting too smart for their own good.</p> <p><b> Play times</b></p> <p>So the play ethic can be embraced by more than the digital generation, those dotcom munards playing the future with their mouses and joysticks. Behind the soulitarians are the lifestyle militants. They are older; more conventionally employed in the information industries; mostly parents with children, but singletons and post-marrieds, too.</p> <p>For them, being a player is about civilising the workplace, and then about putting work in its proper place. With employers, their demands are for virtual working rather than presenteeism, for collegiality over hierarchy, for information-sharing over empire-building. They want more free time because, with all their accumulations of children and partners, skills and experiences, they 'want a life'. And with the half-way point approaching soon, they're becoming militant in their pursuit of happiness.</p> <p>When our non-work lives become more significant than our work lives, we become less tolerant of our office pathologies - the power-games, the sharp practice, the empty values. The play ethic raises the stakes here: to be a player is to be confident enough in one's abilities to seek the best possible environment for paid employment - either by kicking up a fuss in the organisation, or hap pily moving outside it into self-employment (becoming a consultant, a freelancer, or starting your own company). Meaningful work and serious play become the same thing.</p> <p>Lifestyle militants come in many stripes, and with diverse motivations. For example, many women battling for workplace recognition of their parental responsibilities have been delighted by the increasing amounts of working fathers also joining the fray.</p> <p>But it's still a gentle tide, rather than a thundering advance. And perhaps one reason for this tentativeness is that masculinity in the UK is a mess. It's wandering somewhere between New Man, Old Man and New Lad. British men are cripplingly divided about their responsibilities to their partners, their children and their communities. In fact, it's rare to find men even willing to discuss these issues among themselves.</p> <p>Play might well be one new way of enlisting men in the battle for more free time. The wager might be: what happens when all work and no play makes Jack a bad father? As Anthony Clare points out in his recent book on masculinity, there are specific skills that men can bring to the nurturing of their children - vigorous games, fiddly projects on table tops, trainspotterish enthusiasms.</p> <p>One way to turn a recalcitrant father into a radical father might be to appeal to the permanent big kid inside him: it's ethically right to want to play with your children, to enjoy that activity in and for itself. If that doesn't place men side by side with women in the battle for more parental rights, nothing will.</p> <p>Of course, the fields of play extend wider than the family. Recent months have brought news of a backlash against parents rights: non-parents are beginning to complain about having to 'cover' for their parental colleagues, posing very uncomfortable questions for their employers. If John and Mary can get time for their children - whether they're sick, running in the school races, or grappling with Lego - why can't I get an equal amount of time off work?</p> <p>Proponents of the play ethic would answer: well, why not indeed? If we understand play as the exercise of human freedom and self-fulfilment, from birth to death, then of course the playtime of the childless and the single should be equally rated. Rather than set themselves against radical parents, the 'child-free' advocates should join with them. Together, they could make a powerful common front for more humane employment conditions in the mainstream of the new capitalism.</p> <p>The idea of 'downshifting' always had the faint implication of stepping back from an active life. The play ethic isn't for 'voluntary simplicity', but for voluntary complexity. That famous 'juggling act' - between work and non-work, individual and community, pleasure and duty - should be something which we enjoy rather than rue. But only because we've been to the best juggling schools that money can buy. Which makes us skilled enough to pick up the clubs when they fall, and get back in the ring, along with all the other acrobats, tumblers and trapeze artists.</p> <p><b> Playing hardball</b></p> <p>At this point, one can distinctly hear the hooting derision of the employers' organisations, several leading politicians, and maybe one or two trade union leaders. The play ethic! Good old British shirk ethic more like. Isn't this an argument for the return of the Skivers' Charter?</p> <p>Yet the play ethic isn't anti-capitalism, but capitalist reform - and it's no less urgent for that. Like the work ethic was in its own time, the play ethic is a sincere attempt to legitimise a specific economic order.</p> <p>The policy goals of the play ethic aren't rocket science: all have their benchmarks in normal European politics. Harmonising with France and Italy on a strict 35-hour week, which comes into full operation in both countries on 1 January 2001, is an obvious opportunity.</p> <p>The French experience has been mostly a political success: reducing unemployment, redistributing the smarter work among a wider social class, and even increasing productivity levels (by trading shorter hours for more flexible work patterns at no loss of pay). Yet, more importantly, it has released millions of French citizens back into their own lives - with time to socialise, spectate, self-improve. As Lionel Jospin says: market economy, not market society.</p> <p>The next target is a continent-wide citizen's income, guaranteed to all, bundling all existing benefits and tax credits into one payment. Here, the play ethic respectfully asks that the rhetoric of the Third Way line up with reality. How can those lower down the income scale be expected to become 'enterprising' and 'dynamic', embracing all the risks of the age, when one step away from paid employment sends them either into economic debt, or marks them with the stigma of welfare dependency?</p> <p>Reskilling, taking several jobs in a lifetime, adapting to different styles of working - this is all about work as a discontinuous, constantly uneven and surprising realm. How can this discontinuity be made an opportunity rather than a threat? We can only all be players if we are enabled to be so.</p> <p>Beyond the French-Italian axis, countries such as Holland and Denmark have had success with their systems of 'voluntary unemployment': every worker having the right to one year's leave in their working life, distributed as they see fit, with a state payment at somewhere around 60 to 70 per cent of their original wage. Apart from maintaining high-employment levels - and no noticeable reduction in national productivity - a citizen's wage enables people to feel that their non-work lives are socially esteemed.</p> <p>The last obvious policy is in education. There is already a gathering counter- consensus in the UK around educational reform, led by voices such as Tom Bentley of Demos, CreativeNet and the Scottish Council Foundation: they want to stop 'factory schools turning out factory minds'. The creative child can imagine new problems (rather than have them handed down to them); mingles ideas easily from one realm to another; makes mistakes, as long as they lead to more interesting solutions; and focuses on goals with all their powers of attention. That's a textbook list of the psychological attributes of play.</p> <p>Yet creative education should be about more than producing fodder for the 'creative industries', or a better class of info-worker. The democratisation of creativity could save lives - or, at a minimum, turn those lives away from self-destruction. If the play ethic means anything tangible, it is about occupying the gap that drug culture occupies in our poorest communities. And that gap is created by the distance between 'work' as it stands - Job-Seekers' Allowances, McEmployment of all kinds, the spiritual tedium of 'workfare' Britain - and the individuals who cannot (or will not) conform to its dictates.</p> <p>Drugs, you could say, are the dream-seekers' allowance: the most expedient way to boost your sense of human potential, when all the official routes heading towards that end seem rubble-strewn, or impossibly long, or depressingly unrewarding. What Ibiza has really 'uncovered', for all its reckless, oafish hedonism, is an inarticulate but deeply-felt rejection of the false dignities of contemporary labour. 'I'm largin' it' should be taken literally: it means 'My precious self is bigger than this mousy, pointless social role.'</p> <p>An education for creativity which wanted to be truly 'inclusive' would have to listen to this elemental and popular desire for playfulness. It's linked to an earlier, more carnival- esque Britain, evidently not entirely swept away by industrial capitalism. A time of 'happy Mondays' and 'the soul's play-day', when 18th-century Gloucester bishops complained about 'loutish mobs that are drunk with the cup of liberty'.</p> <p>Teachers would have to find ways to tap into these disruptive energies, and turn them into a repertoire of usable life skills. That means, among other new approaches, that the much-abused 'media and cultural studies' would at last get its proper curricular due. Bringing context and history to pop songs, computer games and tabloid TV could provide kids with an exit route from the cul-de-sac of these escapisms, into richer areas of cultural tradition and understanding.</p> <p>Economists who've read their Marx often talk about education as part of the 'reproduction of labour' - the place where the character of the good worker is made. The play ethic wants an education which aims at the reproduction of creativity, the nurturing of the good player's soul. Children should leave schools feeling motivated, in command of their faculties and capable of expressing themselves in ways which both please themselves and others. Why would such a child choose the temporary utopia of drugs over the actual joys of skilful self-creation? Why would they not choose to play?</p> <p><b> Playing for keeps</b></p> <p>Yet if arguments from the mainstream won't convince our new capitalist establishments of the need for serious reform, then perhaps a revolt from the margins will. The waves of anti-corporate and anti-globalisation demonstrations over the past 18 months, from Seattle to Prague, should be warning enough to the new capitalist establishment: they need to change their ways, and fast. If any movement takes the values of play to their most militant political conclusion, it's the 'no-logo' radicals so ably described by Canadian author Naomi Klein.</p> <p>They rub global brands such as Starbucks, Nike and Gap in their own exploitative dirt. And by doing so, they withdraw their consent from the new capitalism, in exactly the ways they need it most: from the head and the heart. We're not going to play your games anymore. We're going to play our own.</p> <p>And play they do - from their use of the net to co-ordinate global protest, to their subversion of billboards and public advertising; from the rave atmosphere of their street protests, to the humour and wit of their sloganeering. It's the combination of spontaneity and absorption, of applied creativity and voluntary action - in short, their identity as players - that defines their politics. How must those corporate marketeers who are trying to calculate the 'lifetime value' of future generations feel about these young semiotic terrorists, these gleeful 'non-sumers', who merrily puncture brands like balloons?</p> <p>The anti-globalisers are still groping for an overall theory, or a defined political programme. Yet, as they do, they should look beyond their own tribes - environmentalists, trade-unions, third-world-firsters, disgruntled students, the digitally disaffected - and realise how much change they could catalyse.</p> <p>At the moment the smashed shops and Monday-morning viruses to unsuspecting in-boxes (remember the 'I Love You' email?) are just shock tactics with diminishing returns. But, once the dust settles, what might the anti-capitalists bring to the politics of a play ethic? They might ask for fair trade, not free trade. For the use of information networks to co-ordinate global democracy, not just to facilitate the movements of global capital. For news media to reflect a much wider range of societal viewpoints. For marketing to talk about the efficiency, design and reusability of products - rather than emphasising the way they'll be the answer to our dreams. For political authority always to be justified, its legitimacy tested against the will of autonomous citizens rather than assumed.</p> <p>What's the alternative? That an aggressive, business-driven order provokes further resistance - which could be a destructive mixture of cyber-terrorism and social intolerance, the computer virus and the funda mentalist commune. A ghastly prospect. But not improbable.</p> <p>In the face of anti-capitalism, we have to devise a credible post-capitalism, a new balance between markets and society which can absorb all (or at least most) of the discontents that we all feel - from manager to tree- hugger, from worried mother to stressed worker. As a new 'spirit of capitalism' (to borrow from Max Weber), directing the new economy and its powers in the direction of human liberation, the play ethic has at least an even chance of striking that balance.</p> <p>Beyond all the high concepts, the vision of a more playful world speaks to something elemental within us. Perhaps it is because our earliest selves are painstakingly built from acts of play. The hand and eye following the mobile in the cot; the meal that becomes a table-top collage; the cardboard box that turns into its own, rickety universe.</p> <p>And perhaps it is no surprise that we adults feel tempted to suppress the intense, utopian joy of these memories. A time when the world was malleable, magical, under the thumb of our imaginations; a time when those around us were willing participants in the games and adventures of life, who shared our inexhaustible energies for the new and the challenging.</p> <p>The radicalism of the play ethic is that it asks us to seriously consider what the American constitution calls 'the pursuit of happiness'. And the roots of our happiness, surely, lie deep in our playful selves. As well as all the previous prescriptions, proposals and policies, we could do worse than to occasionally becalm ourselves and try to recover those early moments - when the art of life was easily learned and joyfully practised.</p> <p>So let's play. I believe it's our turn</p>",

      "bodyText": "This we know: we're stressed-out, debt-ridden, exhausted. We have less time for our families than we feel we should have. We take fewer pleasures from our entertainments and consumptions than we expected to take. We feel less connected to our communities than we ever did. In our workplaces, we subject ourselves to routines and duties which at best seem pointless, at worst unethical or immoral. Yet we also feel like hollow citizens, too weary to respond to any political entreaty with anything other than a shrug. In short, we are workers. Yet why do we meekly accept this condition, when our brave new technological future - the amazing potential still to be unleashed in computers, genetics and molecular engineering - could change it utterly? Why, with all this power at our disposal, do we still feel like mere objects ourselves? But this is how the work ethic continues to grip us. It doesn't matter how many machines could do our more tedious mental and physical labours. Forget the promise of the future, or even the possibilities of the present. Too many of us still regard turning up for work, however dispiriting or futile, as the very mark of inclusion and legitimacy, the measure of our moral fibre. 'I put in the hours, therefore I am.' Anything beyond the steely certainties of the work ethic seem either frightening or flaky: the oblivion of no job, the insecurity of self-employment, the turpitude of domesticity. So the treadmill is wearily mounted, once again - in absence of any alternative vision. Yet why believe in work, when work doesn't believe in you? The constant watchwords of the new capitalism are flexibility, creativity, self-improvement. Workers are urged to 'get up to speed' with a runaway world: we must become mobile and tensile, enterprising and capable. Yet these injunctions come from companies which hire you for a year, six months, maybe even less; which might be taken over at any time; which try to wriggle out of long-term entanglements such as pensions, wage and holiday agreements; and which shed labour whenever there's a dip in the markets. Trying to excel for companies that are themselves transient, provisional and unforgiving will one day seem like the grandest folly. When that realisation comes - that is, when the work ethic crumbles - then an intellectual vacuum will open up at the heart of contemporary capitalism, and we'll need a Big Idea. Over the last decade, we've already seen a procession of not-big-enough ideas - 'downshifting', 'work-life balance', all those slackers and idlers. None of them with much success or distinction. They all try to speak to our deep common anxiety: that if we keep up our loyalty to the work ethic, in a world where competition, mutability and innovation rule supreme, we will destroy ourselves. The LSE's Richard Sennett calls this the 'corrosion of our characters' - where the acids of the new capitalism eat away at the old industrial virtues of self-discipline, sacrifice and duty. What we need is a new, similarly powerful social ethic for these hyper-demanding times. Some other world view that can give meaning to our busy lives. Something that could make all these demands for 'creativity' and 'achievement' worth the effort. I play, therefore I am Welcome to the play ethic. First of all, don't take 'play' to mean anything idle, wasteful or frivolous. The trivialisation of play was the work ethic's most lasting, and most regrettable achievement. This is 'play' as the great philosophers understood it: the experience of being an active, creative and fully autonomous person. The play ethic is about having the confidence to be spontaneous, creative and empathetic across every area of you life - in relationships, in the community, in your cultural life, as well as paid employment. It's about placing yourself, your passions and enthusiasms at the centre of your world. By clearing space for activities that are pleasurable, voluntary and imaginative - that is, for play - you'll have better memory, sharper reasoning and more optimism about the future. As Brian Sutton-Smith, the dean of Play Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, says, 'The opposite of play isn't work. It's depression. To play is to act out and be wilful, exultant and committed, as if one is assured of one's prospects.' So to call yourself a 'player', rather than a 'worker', is to immediately widen your conception of who you are and what you might be capable of doing. It is to dedicate yourself to realising your full human potential; to be active, not passive. The play ethic is what happens when the values of play become the foundation of a whole way of life. It turns us into more militant producers and more discriminating consumers. It causes us to re-prioritise the affairs of our hearts, to upgrade the quality of our emotional and social relationships. It makes us more activist in our politics, but less traditional in their expression. And most of all, the play ethic forces us to think deeply about how we should pursue our pleasures - and how we reconcile that with our social duties. So, just like the work ethic, the play ethic is a set of feelings and principles. But the difference between the two is huge. Work is always (to coin a phrase) the involuntary sector - the realm of necessity, where men and women have to do what they have to do. But as Sartre says, play is what you do when you feel at your most free, your most voluntary. When every positive decision you make about your life carries both a risk, and a promise, of something new and challenging taking place. This is why the play ethic isn't 'the leisure ethic': the last thing it involves is slumped relaxation. Ever since the 'Protestant ethic' achieved its dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries - making sure that workers turned up at the factory gates every morning - work has tried to keep play's unpredictable energies at bay. Play has been corralled into the pen of 'leisure' and 'entertainment' - the workers' playtime, where we undergo 'recreation' for the next day's grind. Or it has been infantilised as an immature state of being, a permissible excess in the young, which all serious adults must put behind them. Or play has erupted through the cracks of our well-managed lives, as a series of counter- culture movements in the West - from the beats to the hippies, from punks to the ravers, from 'no future' to 'no logo'. Yet it's only over the last half-decade or so that the conditions have been ripe for the values of play to assume their rightful place in modern life. This is the grand loosening-up of Western societies, under the pressures of feminism, market forces, and latterly our powerful new technologies. These pressures have untied all those constraints of class, gender and identity which secured our loyalty to the work ethic. Men and women now live in 'risk societies', where so many more choices and decisions have to be made about life. What do I need to survive? Is this safe to eat? Should I stay with this person? What am I going to do now? Never before in history have so many individuals felt so individualised. We are 'developing a feeling for freedom', in the words of the German sociologist Ulrich Beck. But the values of work throw a damp, heavy blanket over that development. The work ethic was always about battering down our responses, regimenting out behaviour - all those Christian inhibitions that were drilled into the 18th and 19th century worker, so that he could divide himself (and his labours) for the better workings of industry. Being a player, by contrast, is about the freedom to be inventive, nurturing and modern. Brave new office Why must we kill ourselves... for work? The play ethic is an attempt to kick-start a new conversation about how we bring creativity and dynamism into the heart of everyday life. We can start the conversation in one obvious place - with the overlords of the new capitalism, both in politics and business. Stop trying to corrode our characters, in Richard Sennett's words - and start helping us evolve and strengthen our characters. If we need to 'get up to speed', then give us the right kind of vehicle, with the best possible fuel, to accelerate. Don't use your powerful technologies to regiment and discipline us, to squeeze more work out of fewer numbers and discard the remainder: use them to liberate as many people as possible into lives of self-determined activity and increasing fulfilment. Treat us as players rather than workers, and the promise of this new century might well be realised. Believe in us, and we might believe in you. The play ethic holds out the chance that people can indeed increase their capacity to cope with this intrinsically demanding future. But if we're going to advance ourselves, we can't do it by ourselves. To be blunt, a world fit for players won't happen without a huge and visionary reinvestment in the public sector, and an even greater rethink of standard business practice - both taking the maximisation of human potential as their aim. Yet the movements in this direction so far have been pathetically inadequate. We need the kind of tax-and-spend policies which would frighten the horses of the Treasury (despite the fact that each of these ideas are well-represented in the mainstream media and politics of mainland Europe and Scandinavia). But that's not all. We'd need a welfare system that invested in and sustained our non-working lives, rather than distrusted and demonised them. And a powerfully comprehensive education system, funded way beyond current levels, aimed at establishing an 'intellectual democracy'. And an employment policy which set industry-wide targets for a progressive reduction of the working week to 35 hours, with no loss of pay. On this, the politics of the play ethic is unashamedly democratic. It's the majority of the population, not just the much-vaunted 'knowledge elites', who should get to be players. Reducing work hours is one way (among others) of sharing out the 'clever' jobs. And no one should doubt that employment will be getting cleverer and cleverer. As US technology critic Jeremy Rifkin says, the industries of the 21st century won't require a mass labour force. 'But they will require the best minds working together with very sophisticated software and wetware - computer and genetic technology. The Industrial Age ended slave labour. The biotech and infotech century is going to end mass wage labour. So what are we going to do with everybody?' 'We don't have a social and political vision', continues Rifkin, 'that is powerful enough to match these new technologies. We can't imagine what human beings could do if they're not needed in the marketplace or for government service.' The play ethic is exactly that vision - an attempt to imagine what human beings could do under these coming conditions. Not slumped in front of the television, not lost in a narcotic stupor, not listless or apathetic or passive - but an imaginative, engaged and active citizenry. Active because motivated, and motivated because there is an intimate, enriching connection between who they really are, and what they actually do. In the words of Brian Sutton-Smith, 'Play as the action in which we truly live.' All power to the soulitariat! So who's playing right now? Has anyone escaped the bonds of the work ethic and broken through to the other side? At the beginning of this new century, the social group that seems to be playing for keeps is the digital generation. For them, play is naturally what you do with your world: there's no angst or self-loathing about it. The technology that hovers like an axe over the neck of the traditional worker is more like a toy for them - a means of empowerment, not exploitation. They've left for the Playstation, these screenagers and cybernauts, and they're never coming home. This is the generation that was allowed to download their lives for free - browsers for nothing, web-mail for nothing, bootlegged software for nothing. So they've already got a weird, almost dotcommunist sense of property rights, which subverts the work ethic at its core. When the Net-Gens graduate from college, and go to the job market, the first thing they do is play around with the idea of a career itself. As a recent Industrial Society report says, these 'free workers' also want to find an emotional content in the work they're doing. They wish to cut deals with employers that maximise their control of their time, their environment, their personal commitments. They don't believe that fun and pleasure should be confined to after-hours: they want it when they draw a wage as well. They are neither the yuppies of the 80s, nor the downshifters of the 90s. They are eager to take all the opportunities that the new network society can offer, but wise enough to realise that wage-labour is only one strand in their life stories. We've been struggling to describe them over these last few years - Gen-X to Gen-Y, alt.dots to screenagers. Let's risk another term, which tries to express their playful balancing of employment, environment and experience. The bearers of the play ethic, right at the heart of the new economy, are a different kind of worker: not proletarians, but 'soulitarians'. These are the backpackers of Alex Garland's The Beach , using cheap flights and travel literature to make the world their playground. These are the ravers who grew up, but who can't (and won't) forget those blissed-out moments of transcendence, when drugs and beats blurred the boundaries of their selves. Great experiences matter to soulitarians as much as cool commodities. In the late 50s, the radical historian EP Thompson anticipated this in his famous essay on Time and Industrial Capitalism . Musing on what a post-work society might be like, Thompson suggested that its rhythms might rely 'neither upon the seasons, nor upon the market, but upon human occasions'. Which has happened: the soulitarian is above all a connoisseur of 'human occasions', from festival to tourist trail, from anti-corporate carnival to urban hang out. True players wield a huge bargaining chip in their dealings with the new capitalism. They understand the core political fact of the knowledge economy: you need my brains, and my heart, and my willingness, more than I need your money and security. The soulitarians happily flit between start-up and corporation, self-employment and job-sharing, being paid in cash and being paid in kind. If and when they work, they work because they want to. The fact is that you don't have to be a dotcommer to be a player. It remains the case that almost everybody can be a soulitarian. The work ethic was essentially mind control: industry had to find a way to exploit the worker's body - so it had to tether his or her mind with a whole weight of guilt, shame and status. But now the worker's body is useless, replaced by ever smarter machines, industry is left with the workers' mind to exploit - and that's proving extremely difficult. For every time you ask a mind to reskill and upgrade, you make that mind more aware of its singular talents, subtler in its workings - and, therefore, more demanding about the life it wants to lead. The 'smart' workers are getting too smart for their own good. Play times So the play ethic can be embraced by more than the digital generation, those dotcom munards playing the future with their mouses and joysticks. Behind the soulitarians are the lifestyle militants. They are older; more conventionally employed in the information industries; mostly parents with children, but singletons and post-marrieds, too. For them, being a player is about civilising the workplace, and then about putting work in its proper place. With employers, their demands are for virtual working rather than presenteeism, for collegiality over hierarchy, for information-sharing over empire-building. They want more free time because, with all their accumulations of children and partners, skills and experiences, they 'want a life'. And with the half-way point approaching soon, they're becoming militant in their pursuit of happiness. When our non-work lives become more significant than our work lives, we become less tolerant of our office pathologies - the power-games, the sharp practice, the empty values. The play ethic raises the stakes here: to be a player is to be confident enough in one's abilities to seek the best possible environment for paid employment - either by kicking up a fuss in the organisation, or hap pily moving outside it into self-employment (becoming a consultant, a freelancer, or starting your own company). Meaningful work and serious play become the same thing. Lifestyle militants come in many stripes, and with diverse motivations. For example, many women battling for workplace recognition of their parental responsibilities have been delighted by the increasing amounts of working fathers also joining the fray. But it's still a gentle tide, rather than a thundering advance. And perhaps one reason for this tentativeness is that masculinity in the UK is a mess. It's wandering somewhere between New Man, Old Man and New Lad. British men are cripplingly divided about their responsibilities to their partners, their children and their communities. In fact, it's rare to find men even willing to discuss these issues among themselves. Play might well be one new way of enlisting men in the battle for more free time. The wager might be: what happens when all work and no play makes Jack a bad father? As Anthony Clare points out in his recent book on masculinity, there are specific skills that men can bring to the nurturing of their children - vigorous games, fiddly projects on table tops, trainspotterish enthusiasms. One way to turn a recalcitrant father into a radical father might be to appeal to the permanent big kid inside him: it's ethically right to want to play with your children, to enjoy that activity in and for itself. If that doesn't place men side by side with women in the battle for more parental rights, nothing will. Of course, the fields of play extend wider than the family. Recent months have brought news of a backlash against parents rights: non-parents are beginning to complain about having to 'cover' for their parental colleagues, posing very uncomfortable questions for their employers. If John and Mary can get time for their children - whether they're sick, running in the school races, or grappling with Lego - why can't I get an equal amount of time off work? Proponents of the play ethic would answer: well, why not indeed? If we understand play as the exercise of human freedom and self-fulfilment, from birth to death, then of course the playtime of the childless and the single should be equally rated. Rather than set themselves against radical parents, the 'child-free' advocates should join with them. Together, they could make a powerful common front for more humane employment conditions in the mainstream of the new capitalism. The idea of 'downshifting' always had the faint implication of stepping back from an active life. The play ethic isn't for 'voluntary simplicity', but for voluntary complexity. That famous 'juggling act' - between work and non-work, individual and community, pleasure and duty - should be something which we enjoy rather than rue. But only because we've been to the best juggling schools that money can buy. Which makes us skilled enough to pick up the clubs when they fall, and get back in the ring, along with all the other acrobats, tumblers and trapeze artists. Playing hardball At this point, one can distinctly hear the hooting derision of the employers' organisations, several leading politicians, and maybe one or two trade union leaders. The play ethic! Good old British shirk ethic more like. Isn't this an argument for the return of the Skivers' Charter? Yet the play ethic isn't anti-capitalism, but capitalist reform - and it's no less urgent for that. Like the work ethic was in its own time, the play ethic is a sincere attempt to legitimise a specific economic order. The policy goals of the play ethic aren't rocket science: all have their benchmarks in normal European politics. Harmonising with France and Italy on a strict 35-hour week, which comes into full operation in both countries on 1 January 2001, is an obvious opportunity. The French experience has been mostly a political success: reducing unemployment, redistributing the smarter work among a wider social class, and even increasing productivity levels (by trading shorter hours for more flexible work patterns at no loss of pay). Yet, more importantly, it has released millions of French citizens back into their own lives - with time to socialise, spectate, self-improve. As Lionel Jospin says: market economy, not market society. The next target is a continent-wide citizen's income, guaranteed to all, bundling all existing benefits and tax credits into one payment. Here, the play ethic respectfully asks that the rhetoric of the Third Way line up with reality. How can those lower down the income scale be expected to become 'enterprising' and 'dynamic', embracing all the risks of the age, when one step away from paid employment sends them either into economic debt, or marks them with the stigma of welfare dependency? Reskilling, taking several jobs in a lifetime, adapting to different styles of working - this is all about work as a discontinuous, constantly uneven and surprising realm. How can this discontinuity be made an opportunity rather than a threat? We can only all be players if we are enabled to be so. Beyond the French-Italian axis, countries such as Holland and Denmark have had success with their systems of 'voluntary unemployment': every worker having the right to one year's leave in their working life, distributed as they see fit, with a state payment at somewhere around 60 to 70 per cent of their original wage. Apart from maintaining high-employment levels - and no noticeable reduction in national productivity - a citizen's wage enables people to feel that their non-work lives are socially esteemed. The last obvious policy is in education. There is already a gathering counter- consensus in the UK around educational reform, led by voices such as Tom Bentley of Demos, CreativeNet and the Scottish Council Foundation: they want to stop 'factory schools turning out factory minds'. The creative child can imagine new problems (rather than have them handed down to them); mingles ideas easily from one realm to another; makes mistakes, as long as they lead to more interesting solutions; and focuses on goals with all their powers of attention. That's a textbook list of the psychological attributes of play. Yet creative education should be about more than producing fodder for the 'creative industries', or a better class of info-worker. The democratisation of creativity could save lives - or, at a minimum, turn those lives away from self-destruction. If the play ethic means anything tangible, it is about occupying the gap that drug culture occupies in our poorest communities. And that gap is created by the distance between 'work' as it stands - Job-Seekers' Allowances, McEmployment of all kinds, the spiritual tedium of 'workfare' Britain - and the individuals who cannot (or will not) conform to its dictates. Drugs, you could say, are the dream-seekers' allowance: the most expedient way to boost your sense of human potential, when all the official routes heading towards that end seem rubble-strewn, or impossibly long, or depressingly unrewarding. What Ibiza has really 'uncovered', for all its reckless, oafish hedonism, is an inarticulate but deeply-felt rejection of the false dignities of contemporary labour. 'I'm largin' it' should be taken literally: it means 'My precious self is bigger than this mousy, pointless social role.' An education for creativity which wanted to be truly 'inclusive' would have to listen to this elemental and popular desire for playfulness. It's linked to an earlier, more carnival- esque Britain, evidently not entirely swept away by industrial capitalism. A time of 'happy Mondays' and 'the soul's play-day', when 18th-century Gloucester bishops complained about 'loutish mobs that are drunk with the cup of liberty'. Teachers would have to find ways to tap into these disruptive energies, and turn them into a repertoire of usable life skills. That means, among other new approaches, that the much-abused 'media and cultural studies' would at last get its proper curricular due. Bringing context and history to pop songs, computer games and tabloid TV could provide kids with an exit route from the cul-de-sac of these escapisms, into richer areas of cultural tradition and understanding. Economists who've read their Marx often talk about education as part of the 'reproduction of labour' - the place where the character of the good worker is made. The play ethic wants an education which aims at the reproduction of creativity, the nurturing of the good player's soul. Children should leave schools feeling motivated, in command of their faculties and capable of expressing themselves in ways which both please themselves and others. Why would such a child choose the temporary utopia of drugs over the actual joys of skilful self-creation? Why would they not choose to play? Playing for keeps Yet if arguments from the mainstream won't convince our new capitalist establishments of the need for serious reform, then perhaps a revolt from the margins will. The waves of anti-corporate and anti-globalisation demonstrations over the past 18 months, from Seattle to Prague, should be warning enough to the new capitalist establishment: they need to change their ways, and fast. If any movement takes the values of play to their most militant political conclusion, it's the 'no-logo' radicals so ably described by Canadian author Naomi Klein. They rub global brands such as Starbucks, Nike and Gap in their own exploitative dirt. And by doing so, they withdraw their consent from the new capitalism, in exactly the ways they need it most: from the head and the heart. We're not going to play your games anymore. We're going to play our own. And play they do - from their use of the net to co-ordinate global protest, to their subversion of billboards and public advertising; from the rave atmosphere of their street protests, to the humour and wit of their sloganeering. It's the combination of spontaneity and absorption, of applied creativity and voluntary action - in short, their identity as players - that defines their politics. How must those corporate marketeers who are trying to calculate the 'lifetime value' of future generations feel about these young semiotic terrorists, these gleeful 'non-sumers', who merrily puncture brands like balloons? The anti-globalisers are still groping for an overall theory, or a defined political programme. Yet, as they do, they should look beyond their own tribes - environmentalists, trade-unions, third-world-firsters, disgruntled students, the digitally disaffected - and realise how much change they could catalyse. At the moment the smashed shops and Monday-morning viruses to unsuspecting in-boxes (remember the 'I Love You' email?) are just shock tactics with diminishing returns. But, once the dust settles, what might the anti-capitalists bring to the politics of a play ethic? They might ask for fair trade, not free trade. For the use of information networks to co-ordinate global democracy, not just to facilitate the movements of global capital. For news media to reflect a much wider range of societal viewpoints. For marketing to talk about the efficiency, design and reusability of products - rather than emphasising the way they'll be the answer to our dreams. For political authority always to be justified, its legitimacy tested against the will of autonomous citizens rather than assumed. What's the alternative? That an aggressive, business-driven order provokes further resistance - which could be a destructive mixture of cyber-terrorism and social intolerance, the computer virus and the funda mentalist commune. A ghastly prospect. But not improbable. In the face of anti-capitalism, we have to devise a credible post-capitalism, a new balance between markets and society which can absorb all (or at least most) of the discontents that we all feel - from manager to tree- hugger, from worried mother to stressed worker. As a new 'spirit of capitalism' (to borrow from Max Weber), directing the new economy and its powers in the direction of human liberation, the play ethic has at least an even chance of striking that balance. Beyond all the high concepts, the vision of a more playful world speaks to something elemental within us. Perhaps it is because our earliest selves are painstakingly built from acts of play. The hand and eye following the mobile in the cot; the meal that becomes a table-top collage; the cardboard box that turns into its own, rickety universe. And perhaps it is no surprise that we adults feel tempted to suppress the intense, utopian joy of these memories. A time when the world was malleable, magical, under the thumb of our imaginations; a time when those around us were willing participants in the games and adventures of life, who shared our inexhaustible energies for the new and the challenging. The radicalism of the play ethic is that it asks us to seriously consider what the American constitution calls 'the pursuit of happiness'. And the roots of our happiness, surely, lie deep in our playful selves. As well as all the previous prescriptions, proposals and policies, we could do worse than to occasionally becalm ourselves and try to recover those early moments - when the art of life was easily learned and joyfully practised. So let's play. I believe it's our turn",

Leonardo's Vitruvian man, as ideal and eugenic as a model in an underwear advertisement, may have been the prototype, but the norm is outnumbered by warped abnormalities: Hogarth's leering monsters, the men in Daumier's caricatures who mutate back into monkeys, or the studies of demoniac derangement by Jean-Martin Charcot. </p> <p>As you enter, Spectacular Bodies confronts you with the instruments you'll need if you want to know yourself.

Stone or metal are at least impervious, immune to pain; at the Hayward, the hardest works to stomach are those in wax, because the medium is so queasily palpable, as squashy and humid as flesh, releasing a sickly fragrance when it is melted and moulded into shape. The medical waxworks of Joseph Towne have a horrific verisimilitude. One cadaver by Towne has stumps for teeth and a five o'clock shadow; his skin is slick, as if with a cold sweat.

The claque shows up in force ready to roar haughty disapproval over this inadequate singer or that misguided concept. Excisions to the original score, not unusual in Wagner, are knowledgeably bemoaned. A gullible press duly reports all next day as if some catastrophe had occurred. In Bayreuth, home town of the annual Wagner festival, hissing is a normal state of affairs, needing almost as much lung training as the singers themselves. But London is not Bayreuth. </p> <p>Booing is still considered an affront rather than a sport. Opera-goers are put off by it, rushing to get rid of tickets or, worse, not buying them at all. Yet by the second night, the audience is usually back to normal and the performance has settled down, a dull truth which is never reported. This was the case last week at the Royal Opera's new production of <b> Tristan und Isolde</b>, the first since 1982. The boos hit the headlines. </p> <p>One loud complaint was that the infatuated couple are never less than a yard from touching each other, staying in their separate blue and red boxes which for most of the hot inaction are still further apart. Some at the Wagner shrine even boo and clap simultaneously to register their loathing of the set and their admiration for the production. This would have been tricky here since producer and designer are, impressively, one and the same person - Herbert Wernicke. </p> <p>As director, he wisely sees Tristan as an exploration of metaphysical love, not a marathon of exhausting Olympic kissing. On the second night, applause was warm with plenty of cheers. The scattering of empty seats suggested a last-minute change of heart by some. The loss is theirs. This is the best new production staged at the Opera House since it reopened last year. The singers might have been better, it is true. As Tristan, the American Jon Frederic West, making his house debut, struggled with a throat infection which may have accounted for his more hectoring moments. Nevertheless, his performance had a dignity not easily achieved in this role, especially in his prolonged death scene which can test even the most patient Wagnerian (whether in the auditorium or on the stage). </p> <p>To complain about reasonable imperfections in the the singing, however, is to miss the point. In Wagner, above all other opera composers, the orchestra is the protagonist. If forced to accept an imbalance between voices and instrumentalists, give me a good orchestra any day, blasphemous though such an attitude might be. Wagner's score encompasses a sound world of formidable complexity, economical even over these great lengths. </p> <p>The ROH orchestra was on peerless form, caressing the music as if it were written for chamber ensemble, the impeccable woodwind relishing each detail with rare clarity. Bernard Haitink, whose Wagner conducting has been one of the musical miracles of the last decade, teased out the sustained phrases where others push, drive and whip the music forward. Paradoxically, this relaxed approach achieves a white-hot intensity; quite how is not easy to divine. </p> <p>In his designs and lighting, Wernicke complements Haitink with a concept (for such it is, no escaping that) of lucidity and intelligence. His principle aim, entirely validated by Wagner's music, is to demonstrate the chasm between the lovers, even when their doomed passion is at its height. His handsome geometric set, in the style we have learned to call classical constructivism, is crisscrossed by slim spears and divided into blocks of solid, painstakingly painted colour, predominantly crimson and indigo but with vivid strips of green to convey the important day-night distinctions in Act 2. </p> <p>The first-act ship (how could anyone seriously say there wasn't one?) pitches and tosses ominously over a grey, glassy ocean, abstract but resonantly suggestive of a seafaring vessel with square sail-cloths. If you need seaweed or Cornish cliffs, you must go else where. Wernicke offers far more, with stunning lighting which shifts like changing clouds. The cruise-liner sailors, in natty blazers and peaked caps, were an irritation. But the moment at which the lovers, singing full tilt of their passion (while yes, still yards apart) are interrupted by the bright light of day and the arrival of Isolde's husband, King Marke, was as shocking as the music demands. </p> <p>Whereas the men in the cast were American and British, both women were German. Gabriele Schnaut, who has sung Isolde for, among others, Simon Rattle (who was in the audience to support her), has a commanding presence and a strapping voice. She may, at times, lack subtlety, but her exciting power more than compensates. As Brang\u00e4ne, Petra Lang was near perfect: impassioned, nervy, wilful, full of remorse at having given her mistress and Tristan the love potion which seals their fate. </p> <p>The words of Wagner's daring verses were audible throughout (accompanied by an excellent surtitle translation by Jonathan Burton). Tristan is Wagner's most extreme libretto, risking all. Little wonder that T.S. Eliot quotes it twice in The Waste Land, for the emotional charge is absolute. </p> <p>In the unlikely event of Raymond Gubbay taking over the Royal Opera House (he put in his application last week), it is difficult to see how he could sell a five-and-a-half-hour romance in which the lovers never even get to hold hands. He has brought new high standards to arena opera at the Albert Hall but here the action is in the words, the spectacle in the music and the wild rhapsody in the head.</p>",

The scattering of empty seats suggested a last-minute change of heart by some. The loss is theirs. This is the best new production staged at the Opera House since it reopened last year. The singers might have been better, it is true. As Tristan, the American Jon Frederic West, making his house debut, struggled with a throat infection which may have accounted for his more hectoring moments. Nevertheless, his performance had a dignity not easily achieved in this role, especially in his prolonged death scene which can test even the most patient Wagnerian (whether in the auditorium or on the stage). To complain about reasonable imperfections in the the singing, however, is to miss the point. In Wagner, above all other opera composers, the orchestra is the protagonist. If forced to accept an imbalance between voices and instrumentalists, give me a good orchestra any day, blasphemous though such an attitude might be. Wagner's score encompasses a sound world of formidable complexity, economical even over these great lengths. The ROH orchestra was on peerless form, caressing the music as if it were written for chamber ensemble, the impeccable woodwind relishing each detail with rare clarity. Bernard Haitink, whose Wagner conducting has been one of the musical miracles of the last decade, teased out the sustained phrases where others push, drive and whip the music forward. Paradoxically, this relaxed approach achieves a white-hot intensity; quite how is not easy to divine. In his designs and lighting, Wernicke complements Haitink with a concept (for such it is, no escaping that) of lucidity and intelligence. His principle aim, entirely validated by Wagner's music, is to demonstrate the chasm between the lovers, even when their doomed passion is at its height. His handsome geometric set, in the style we have learned to call classical constructivism, is crisscrossed by slim spears and divided into blocks of solid, painstakingly painted colour, predominantly crimson and indigo but with vivid strips of green to convey the important day-night distinctions in Act 2. The first-act ship (how could anyone seriously say there wasn't one?) pitches and tosses ominously over a grey, glassy ocean, abstract but resonantly suggestive of a seafaring vessel with square sail-cloths. If you need seaweed or Cornish cliffs, you must go else where. Wernicke offers far more, with stunning lighting which shifts like changing clouds. The cruise-liner sailors, in natty blazers and peaked caps, were an irritation. But the moment at which the lovers, singing full tilt of their passion (while yes, still yards apart) are interrupted by the bright light of day and the arrival of Isolde's husband, King Marke, was as shocking as the music demands. Whereas the men in the cast were American and British, both women were German. Gabriele Schnaut, who has sung Isolde for, among others, Simon Rattle (who was in the audience to support her), has a commanding presence and a strapping voice. She may, at times, lack subtlety, but her exciting power more than compensates. As Brang\u00e4ne, Petra Lang was near perfect: impassioned, nervy, wilful, full of remorse at having given her mistress and Tristan the love potion which seals their fate. The words of Wagner's daring verses were audible throughout (accompanied by an excellent surtitle translation by Jonathan Burton). Tristan is Wagner's most extreme libretto, risking all. Little wonder that T.S. Eliot quotes it twice in The Waste Land, for the emotional charge is absolute. In the unlikely event of Raymond Gubbay taking over the Royal Opera House (he put in his application last week), it is difficult to see how he could sell a five-and-a-half-hour romance in which the lovers never even get to hold hands. He has brought new high standards to arena opera at the Albert Hall but here the action is in the words, the spectacle in the music and the wild rhapsody in the head.",

It seems at first like laborious titillation: a Frenchwoman - a teacher of literature - seems intent on seducing a15-year-old American pupil, Carl. For Madame Melville (Ir\u00e8ne Jacob), sexual power takes priority over everything else. Bonnard's paintings are precious to her only because they remind her of a former lover; to prepare for reading Proust, she declares, is like anticipating a honeymoon. </p> <p>Jacob plays her as an unlikeable but convincing type: intelligent, superficial, a damaged femme fatale. Behind the flirtation is a loneliness which will lead to something uglier - abuse. </p> <p>As Carl, Macaulay Culkin (the child star of Home Alone ) is brilliantly cast. He looks like a lost boy: his smile curving upwards and then losing its way; his fringe as much of a hindrance as his manner; awkward, young. Culkin's voice sounds dry and weak, like someone emerging from a bout of crying. Madame Melville does not want to hurt him, she says, but there is no sign of her having even ordinary care for him - she doesn't even make him breakfast. </p> <p>We are in uplifting rooms (designed by Thomas Lynch) with walls as blue as copper sulphate crystals and tall shelves filled with books. There are white balconies seemingly unsupported, as if emblematic of the sudden affair between the teacher and her 15-year-old pupil. There will be nothing to catch him when he falls. </p> <p>Nelson is most at home with an epic scale in his plays, but here, as in Goodnight Children Everywhere, he sustains intimate dramatic tension beautifully. The unease - the arid, disagreeable atmosphere - never lets up, though it is lightened by anarchic comic moments. </p> <p>It is arresting to see a play in which a woman through age (she is in her thirties) and status becomes as exploitative as any man, as culpable and as cold, even in her most tender gestures. Madame Melville and her friend Ruth (played with spirit by Madeleine Potter), who lives in the flat above, are like a pair of corrupt schoolgirls trying to reclaim a naivet\u00e9 they lost years ago. Ruth seems unhinged, a fiddler on the roof with an unhygienic lover and a family she has abandoned somewhere in the States. </p> <p>Carl may be consenting, but he is being played upon, none the less. Where does such a story come from? It reminded me of David Mamet's Oleanna - without the protest (and therefore more insidious). It is a kind of haunting, a comedy where there is no reason to laugh. It describes an affair: short, memorable, best forgotten. </p> <p>French seduction is the theme of the week in the London theatre. <strong> Napoleon</strong> is on the rampage at the Shaftesbury. He has become a softie, with a caramel for a heart. Hang on a minute though, he's changed. He is hard, authority personified. Or is he, in fact, mad - a deranged figure in an army coat? This Napoleon does not give up or add up. Paul Baker pours into the performance everything he has got but has more than the Alps to scale in Andrew Sabiston and Timothy Williams's new musical. </p> <p>When he first meets Josephine, she resists him briefly (the gist is: 'Not this afternoon, Bonaparte.') Anastasia Barzee sings her way out of trouble miraculously, making even the most hackneyed lyrics tolerable. She looks beautiful, exactly like David's portrait of Madame Recamier (she even has the couch to pine and recline on). Michael Yeargan's set and Marie-Jeanne Lecca's costumes are magnificent: energetically luxurious. Yards of scarlet velvet, mists, chteaux, armies on the march in elegant silhouette, images of history passing by. </p> <p>A virtue is made of vulgarity. A vast, hinged mirror swings upwards dramatically to reflect Josephine and Bonaparte in each other's arms. A suitably obsessive cartography dominates the design: Bonaparte takes possession of Josephine on a bed that doubles as a map, in a spirit of global domination. </p> <p>Francesca Zambello is a marvellous director of opera but although her talents - and that of her cast - are much in evidence, their gifts are squandered here. David Burt's Talleyrand, for example, is marvellously good, but he has nothing decent to sing. This epic story needs thrilling, capacious, heart-stirring music. It needs to match Boney's heroism. </p> <p>If only Verdi could rise from his grave and make his way down to the Shaftesbury with a new score under his arm.

The bag being handed over in the foyer of this small but bustling recording studio is not full of dirty laundry, but white labels - exclusive first pressings of new records and remixes. The DJ collecting them looks like he'll be more than happy to give them the heavy play requested. On the UK garage scene right now, few artists are generating as much excitement as Wookie, and a new track from the writer/producer is a valuable commodity. Meanwhile Wookie's recent chart hit 'Battle' is coming loud and clear through the studio speakers, as phones ring, and the door buzzes with a constant stream of visitors. </p> <p>It's 10 years since Soul II Soul - a collective built around Jazzie B and his north London sound system - burst into the charts, first with 'Keep on Movin' and then the No 1 'Back To Life'. Fusing the traditions of Jamaican reggae sound systems, the melodies of American R&amp;B and the attitude of the London club underground, Jazzy and his crew created a sound that was proudly black, but also unmistakably British. A decade on, it's easy to forget their impact. When Soul II Soul toured the US, many interviewers confessed they hadn't known there was a black community in Britain. The music was also one of the first outward signs of a growing confidence in UK club culture. No longer content to produce pale imitations of US sounds, the British dance scene would soon lead the world, inventing whole genres of music: hardcore, jungle, drum'n'bass, UK garage. </p> <p>As a band, Soul II Soul got left behind in the rush, releasing five albums before fading away into oblivion. But their record label has continued to function from its Camden HQ. And now, improbably, it finds itself back on the cutting edge. Away from all the bustle in the tiny backroom that has served as his studio for six years, Jason Chue - aka Wookie - looks happy, but bemused. 'It's all happened so fast,' he admits. </p> <p>He put his first record out at the start of 1999, a bootleg track built around an a cappella version of Whitney Houston's 'It's Not Right But It's OK'. The tune was played by some of the booming UK garage scene's biggest DJs, and more bootlegs followed: 'I won't say how many, because I know it's illegal.' By November Chue had a double platinum record to his credit, a (legal) remix of Gabrielle's 'Sunshine'. He also had a new name: Wookie, playing on his family name Chue. (Chewy, or Chewbacca, was Harrison Ford's hirsute alien partner in the Star Wars movies - a wookie by species.) </p> <p>But Chue was cautious. He'd already been burnt by the music industry, when he worked with famous-for-five-minutes UK R&amp;B artist Wayne Marshall in 1994 - the two fell out over publishing rights to Marshall's hit single 'G Spot'. Shortly afterwards, Chue began working for Soul II Soul, playing on their final album and then working on R&amp;B and hip-hop tracks in their Camden studio. As the demand for his remixes grew he went to Jazzie B for advice, and was told to get back in the studio to make some music of his own. 'I wanted to do remixes - I wanted the money. Then I saw what happened to people around me. They all did these remixes, rinsed out their own sound, but it was all short-term. They didn't start producing, getting songwriting credits. If it wasn't for Jazzie, I'd probably be mixing everything under the sun now, and you wouldn't hear of me in a year's time.' </p> <p>The remixes he has done have been carefully chosen: American artists like Angie Stone to help break his sound across the Atlantic, pop acts such as Texas to widen his audience at home. 'I've turned a lot down. If I'm going to give some of my sound, it's got to be worthwhile,' he says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he began working on new tracks with singer Lain Grey, and soon the major labels wanted to sign him. Despite the big money on offer, Chue chose to stay with Soul II Soul Recordings. 'I've learned a lot about the business from Jazzie,' he explained. 'He always called me his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, from day one. He showed me where all the potholes are in the road. He never tells me what to do, he always presents me with the options, and I think I took the right one.' </p> <p>Chue describes himself as 'a late starter' when it comes to music. 'Because I never had music lessons, I don't know the rules. So I break them all the time. It's quite innocent, the way I approach it.' His dad ran a reggae sound system, but his mother was strict, and young Jason never went out clubbing. He didn't buy records, and only really started playing the cheap keyboard he'd bought after he'd been made redundant from his job at an architectural practice. Meanwhile he started going to drum'n'bass clubs, and was excited by what he heard. 'It was so innovative. I used to call them technicians, not musicians, because it wasn't exactly music they were playing - just this creation.' </p> <p>Noting that many didn't like the music because of its breakneck tempo and lack of melody, he took the inventive drum programming and slowed it down. 'I wanted to create songs, not just a beat going round and round.' </p> <p>Carried by Lain Grey's powerful voice, it's the songs which make Wookie's eponymous debut album so exciting. Only one track isn't original. 'What's Going On' is a juddering, Latin-tinged dance number with vocals that are oddly familiar. It's Soul II Soul's Caron Wheeler, singing what you gradually realise is a radically reworked 'Back To Life'. 'I wanted to do a track where you knew the vocals, but not the style of music,' says Chue. 'Like a teaser advert. It's my homage to Soul II Soul.' </p> <p>Chue is already moving on. He's doing remixes under the name Exe Men, releasing underground tunes on his own label, preparing to produce new talent through his set-up with Soul II Soul. But for now, there's Wookie , a record that shows just how far we've come in 10 years. In it you'll hear the frenetic breakbeats of drum'n'bass, the distorted basslines of acid house, a sense of rhythm and space straight from reggae, and some great tunes. New soul, UK garage, or just the latest dancefloor grooves - whatever you want to call it, it's a sound that could only have been made right now in Britain.

      "bodyText": "'Rinse it ouy for us, mate!' The bag being handed over in the foyer of this small but bustling recording studio is not full of dirty laundry, but white labels - exclusive first pressings of new records and remixes. The DJ collecting them looks like he'll be more than happy to give them the heavy play requested. On the UK garage scene right now, few artists are generating as much excitement as Wookie, and a new track from the writer/producer is a valuable commodity. Meanwhile Wookie's recent chart hit 'Battle' is coming loud and clear through the studio speakers, as phones ring, and the door buzzes with a constant stream of visitors. It's 10 years since Soul II Soul - a collective built around Jazzie B and his north London sound system - burst into the charts, first with 'Keep on Movin' and then the No 1 'Back To Life'. Fusing the traditions of Jamaican reggae sound systems, the melodies of American R&amp;B and the attitude of the London club underground, Jazzy and his crew created a sound that was proudly black, but also unmistakably British. A decade on, it's easy to forget their impact. When Soul II Soul toured the US, many interviewers confessed they hadn't known there was a black community in Britain. The music was also one of the first outward signs of a growing confidence in UK club culture. No longer content to produce pale imitations of US sounds, the British dance scene would soon lead the world, inventing whole genres of music: hardcore, jungle, drum'n'bass, UK garage. As a band, Soul II Soul got left behind in the rush, releasing five albums before fading away into oblivion. But their record label has continued to function from its Camden HQ. And now, improbably, it finds itself back on the cutting edge. Away from all the bustle in the tiny backroom that has served as his studio for six years, Jason Chue - aka Wookie - looks happy, but bemused. 'It's all happened so fast,' he admits.

      "body": "<p>I don't know what they put in the old folks' breakfast cereal in Northampton, Massachusetts - cocaine, perhaps - but it certainly keeps them starry-eyed and vital. Well at least a couple of dozen of them anyway. I'm sitting in a small community college theatre watching rehearsals by a chorus group whose membership almost exclusively comprises performers in their seventies and eighties. The oldest is so old - 96! - that she has to appear on video. Have they never heard of bingo out here? </p> <p>The band tunes up (piano, fiddle, accordion), the lights go down. Medical orderlies sit playing cards at a table, patients wander onstage in nightclothes, bonnets, powdered wigs. There's a trio of wizened cowboys in ponyskin waistcoats and NHS specs. Someone is wearing a crown. Poor dears... But then the singing starts - a clattering 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' (yippee-yi-yaaaay!); a poignant ' I Didn't Know What Time It Was'. Ten minutes in, and they're breaking into 'All Shook Up', with Elvises of different vintages swaying about, including one with angel's wings. One woman is dressed (for no compelling reason) as a bee. She finishes the number by doing the splits. Another is led gently away by a nurse, as if for her medication. The doctor sings a deadpan 'Every Breath You Take' one of his old ladies follows up with 'Satisfaction' by the Stones, sloping off afterwards muttering to herself: 'I can't get no...' </p> <p>You wouldn't think it, but it is a sight to marvel at. The songs dissolve into each other to stop you applauding before you get the point that they are not just old people angling for the novelty vote but people who happen to be old doing a piece about age and mortality. The idea is for it to flow. Individuals materialise at the mike - some ferocious-looking, others palpably frail - before melting back into the chorus, some seated, others marauding like something out of Stephen King (Night of the Living Senior Citizens), the ensemble swelling suddenly into vocal support, one minute shuffling about, the next fists raised high. And then, as the piano player starts picking out the strangely familiar introduction to 'Stairway to Heaven', a ghostly procession makes its way across the stage, each of them carrying a pillow. </p> <p>It's surreal enough, seeing so many old people together who aren't busy clogging up the post office on Tuesday mornings, but Led Zeppelin? And there's more - Talking Heads, Dylan, The Beatles, The Clash for God's sake! You might expect this to be amusing (and much of it is) or perhaps overly sentimental, but the cumulative effect is just - well, startling. And moving. </p> <p>I thought I could never be surprised again by these songs, but there is also something affecting about watching a woman old enough to be Jimmy Page's mother reworking a pop classic under the spotlight instead of sitting at home knitting bedsocks for the cat. Certainly I thought the day was past when the line 'There's still time to change the road you're on' could bring a lump to my throat the size of Bournemouth. </p> <p>They're halfway through a blood-chilling version of Dylan's 'Forever Young' when Roy Faudree the stage director steps in to call a halt, complaining that there's too much fidgeting going on. One of the cowboys has been messing about with his mouth organ; and the doctor shouldn't really be asking Bob to put his surgeon's cap straight in the middle of a number. Bob Cilman is the musical director. Bob and Roy are the creative engines behind the group; both somewhere in their mid-youth forties; both boho-cool, energetic, dedicated, professional; both sport the official beard of artistic endeavour. </p> <p>The Young at Heart chorus began in 1982 at a meal site for the elderly run by Bob, then between jobs (he now has one as programme director for the town's arts council). He started putting on community shows (one of which saw the oldsters teamed up with breakdancing street kids from the housing projects); Roy, who once performed with the Wooster Group and now directs his own avant garde company No Theater, became involved and together they took the chorus to a festival in Rotterdam in the early Nineties, followed by tours in Belgium and Germany as the group blossomed into a cult international hit. (They arrive in the UK for the first time at the end of this month.) </p> <p>'It seemed insane at the time. How would you transport 20 people in their eighties across Europe?' says Roy. 'But somehow we went over there, did a show composed of songs we'd been doing at schools and other events. It seemed silly and corny in a way, but right from the start there was something about their presence on stage that was not easy to read. </p> <p>'It was disarming to look at. And then to hear these songs that you know well, but sung by older people - it was, like, you heard the lyrics differently? I'm still intrigued with the effect that has on audiences.' And these, by the way, are not audiences bussed out from old people's homes but regular hip, youngish theatregoers. </p> <p>But what's also disarming is seeing the way Roy and Bob handle their performers in rehearsal. I notice that neither of them is ostentatiously 'kind' to anyone. No one offers to help anyone across the road, so to speak. And yet there must be specific problems, I suggest. I'm trying to be delicate here, but of course I'm thinking about the tendency for old people's minds to wander a bit. Do they have trouble remembering their lines? I ask. </p> <p>'On the first point,' says Roy, 'I should say I'm not interested in looking upon this as some kind of social service. I'm only interested in them as artists. It's important that they have the focus and the discipline to stay with what we're trying to work on. Second, I find it's better to work on something for a number of months than try to get them to do something precise in just a few rehearsals. Some pick up things quickly, others less so. But, then, I don't think that's restricted to age.' </p> <p>Certainly things have changed since the days when the Young at Heart project was a social service, when anyone who wanted to be in the group could just show up at rehearsals, says Bob. </p> <p>The pressure of success has seen to that. 'Back then, we had people who hardly opened their mouths for six months because they were so frightened to be there. Then as time went by they just turned into these incredible performers. But now, because of the European trips, if we lose someone through sickness, we need to find good people who we can slot in from the start,' he says. </p> <p>And not surprisingly, illness can be a factor. The chap currently playing the doctor has had shingles and had to reschedule an appointment today with the surgeon for a chronic back problem. They are rehearsing his parts with other people but no one is ruling him out for the London trip. 'He was in really bad shape in Berlin too,' says Bob. 'We had him on stage in a wheelchair.' He chuckles. 'But he looked so good.' </p> <p>No one has ever actually expired on stage, he says (because I had to ask), but there was one man who went down in rehearsal, broke his hip, had a heart attack while being ferried between hospitals and then went into a coma. 'This was about a month before we were due to go to Europe. Everybody was flipped out - this wonderful guy, great performer. It was just horrible. But then he came out of the coma just days before we left. He was well enough to sit up in a hospital bed and perform the song on videotape. We played it as people were leaving the auditorium.' </p> <p>'What was the song?' </p> <p>'James Brown - 'I Feel Good', he laughs. 'When we got back he joined us for a number of concerts.' </p> <p>'Fantastic! So he was OK?' </p> <p>'Well, no, he died.' </p> <p>I wonder whether, eventually, age renders them less able to make a valid contribution. 'That doesn't happen. In this group, people get more interesting and better as they get older. Maybe some people lose their vocal power, but then they become really interesting to watch.' </p> <p>He mentions the 96-year-old on video. He mentions Helen, who I say looks almost spectral on stage. 'She's had throat cancer,' he says. </p> <p>'It's not just what's coming out of their mouth that counts. It's what they're doing, what they look like too. It's a good thing for old people to have something this focused in their lives. I think it really helps people stay healthy. It's a lot of work. It's good for their minds. It's good for all their parts.' </p> <p>After rehearsals, I'm out in the corridor with one of the cast, Elaine, 77, discussing (I can't quite believe this) the Clash: 'You have to look pretty hard to find a melody,' she says flatly. </p> <p>'I mean, let's face it, \"London Calling\" has two notes. And the lyrics are so hard to memorise - the lines following each other have nothing to do with each other! There's no context. I want to know the meaning of every single word,' Elaine adds. </p> <p>And then there's 'Stairway to Heaven', which she learnt from sheet music. What did she think of Led Zeppelin's er... 'version' when she heard it? </p> <p>'Not as good as ours.' She laughs. </p> <p>Even Dylan's lyrics come under scrutiny. 'I love \"Forever Young\" but...' She grimaces. '\"May God bless and keep you always\"? \"May your wishes all come true\"? It would be very easy to be satirical about that. But we do it absolutely straight and it works. You expect some kind of parody, but it's not. To start with, a lot of people came to see us with curiosity - what do these crazy old people think they're doing? Well... we told em,' she laughs. 'And after that first show in Rotterdam, you couldn't get tickets.' </p> <p>\u0095 Young at Heart's Road to Heaven show is at Aberystwyth Arts Centre 27-28 October (01970 623232) and the Lyric Hammersmith 1-4 November (020 8741 2311)</p>",

But what's also disarming is seeing the way Roy and Bob handle their performers in rehearsal. I notice that neither of them is ostentatiously 'kind' to anyone. No one offers to help anyone across the road, so to speak. And yet there must be specific problems, I suggest. I'm trying to be delicate here, but of course I'm thinking about the tendency for old people's minds to wander a bit. Do they have trouble remembering their lines? I ask. 'On the first point,' says Roy, 'I should say I'm not interested in looking upon this as some kind of social service. I'm only interested in them as artists. It's important that they have the focus and the discipline to stay with what we're trying to work on. Second, I find it's better to work on something for a number of months than try to get them to do something precise in just a few rehearsals. Some pick up things quickly, others less so. But, then, I don't think that's restricted to age.' Certainly things have changed since the days when the Young at Heart project was a social service, when anyone who wanted to be in the group could just show up at rehearsals, says Bob. The pressure of success has seen to that. 'Back then, we had people who hardly opened their mouths for six months because they were so frightened to be there. Then as time went by they just turned into these incredible performers. But now, because of the European trips, if we lose someone through sickness, we need to find good people who we can slot in from the start,' he says. And not surprisingly, illness can be a factor. The chap currently playing the doctor has had shingles and had to reschedule an appointment today with the surgeon for a chronic back problem. They are rehearsing his parts with other people but no one is ruling him out for the London trip. 'He was in really bad shape in Berlin too,' says Bob. 'We had him on stage in a wheelchair.' He chuckles. 'But he looked so good.' No one has ever actually expired on stage, he says (because I had to ask), but there was one man who went down in rehearsal, broke his hip, had a heart attack while being ferried between hospitals and then went into a coma. 'This was about a month before we were due to go to Europe. Everybody was flipped out - this wonderful guy, great performer. It was just horrible. But then he came out of the coma just days before we left. He was well enough to sit up in a hospital bed and perform the song on videotape. We played it as people were leaving the auditorium.' 'What was the song?' 'James Brown - 'I Feel Good', he laughs. 'When we got back he joined us for a number of concerts.' 'Fantastic! So he was OK?' 'Well, no, he died.' I wonder whether, eventually, age renders them less able to make a valid contribution. 'That doesn't happen. In this group, people get more interesting and better as they get older. Maybe some people lose their vocal power, but then they become really interesting to watch.' He mentions the 96-year-old on video. He mentions Helen, who I say looks almost spectral on stage. 'She's had throat cancer,' he says. 'It's not just what's coming out of their mouth that counts. It's what they're doing, what they look like too. It's a good thing for old people to have something this focused in their lives. I think it really helps people stay healthy. It's a lot of work. It's good for their minds. It's good for all their parts.' After rehearsals, I'm out in the corridor with one of the cast, Elaine, 77, discussing (I can't quite believe this) the Clash: 'You have to look pretty hard to find a melody,' she says flatly. 'I mean, let's face it, \"London Calling\" has two notes. And the lyrics are so hard to memorise - the lines following each other have nothing to do with each other! There's no context. I want to know the meaning of every single word,' Elaine adds. And then there's 'Stairway to Heaven', which she learnt from sheet music. What did she think of Led Zeppelin's er... 'version' when she heard it? 'Not as good as ours.' She laughs. Even Dylan's lyrics come under scrutiny. 'I love \"Forever Young\" but...' She grimaces. '\"May God bless and keep you always\"? \"May your wishes all come true\"? It would be very easy to be satirical about that. But we do it absolutely straight and it works. You expect some kind of parody, but it's not. To start with, a lot of people came to see us with curiosity - what do these crazy old people think they're doing? Well... we told em,' she laughs. 'And after that first show in Rotterdam, you couldn't get tickets.' \u0095 Young at Heart's Road to Heaven show is at Aberystwyth Arts Centre 27-28 October (01970 623232) and the Lyric Hammersmith 1-4 November (020 8741 2311)",

      "body": "<p>Marian Keyes opens the door to her large yellow Dublin house. Inside, it is all razzle-dazzle colour: rooms painted lilac, neon green, azure blue, stinging saffron, unapologetic pink. The sofas are in lime and violet. The rococo mirror is turquoise. She herself is dressed to match the vertical modernist radiators, in a vivid purple top; glowing. She is small, even in her black ankle boots. She has round, surprised eyes in a tiny pale face. Her abundant dark hair swishes across her painted-rosebud mouth. Her voice is light, quite high. 'Feck,' she says repeatedly in her Irish lilt. 'Jaysus.' </p> <p>The effect - of the house, of the woman - is not brazen or comic or over-the-top, but oddly consoling. The house, she explains, faces north and, when they bought it, was dark and gloomy; the gaudy colours brighten it up. And her books do the same: her quirky romantic comedies spring from emotions that are actually quite shocking in their violence and wretchedness. Marian Keyes might be a 'feel-good' writer, but she's feel-good with a difference. </p> <p>'Darkness goes alongside proper comedy,' she says. 'The best comedy is rooted in despair.' But, she adds, she believes in personal redemption. 'Oh Jaysus, I do. I have to, because it is miraculous what has happened to someone like me, who was so tormented for so long.' </p> <p>She makes me coffee in a cafetiere. She doesn't drink it herself, and she says that she spent the previous evening rehearsing the making of it for my visit. She watches me anxiously as I take a sip. She is nervous about her new book. She doesn't mind reviewers, but she doesn't want her readers to be disappointed - and she has a lot of readers. Marian Keyes is 37. She has written five novels in as many years. Her first, Watermelon, was published by Poolbeg, a small Irish press, and then snapped up in the UK, instantly galloping on to the bestseller list. Then came Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon and, in two weeks' time, Sushi for Beginners, for which she received a four-book advance of over \u00a3600,000. Her books have sold nearly three million copies worldwide, they have been turned into television dramas and optioned for films. She is wealthy (the 67th richest woman in the UK) and famous: 'the hottest female writer in Britain,' says the publicity blurb. </p> <p>Her novels are often called 'women's fiction' and bracketed with writers like Jane Green or Helen Fielding. But where another heroine might worry about that extra glass of Chardonnay, Marian Keyes's will binge on nauseating amounts of food, three doughnuts and a loaf of bread, a packet of biscuits at a sitting. Where another heroine will wait to get her man, Marian Keyes's may wait and never get; may, indeed, discover that wanting a man is a frailty and an actual cause of her unhappiness. Her women get appallingly drunk, fake orgasms, throw themselves at men they despise and are repulsed by, sleep with each other's friends, hit their children, act in ways that unsettle our feel-good expectations. Rachel's Holiday is set in a rehab clinic and Rachel is a drug-addicted, self-denying, lying, infuriating mess. Often, her women are not in search of love so much as in search of, and in flight from, themselves. </p> <p>In Sushi for Beginners, Marian Keyes turns away from the stubbornly ordinary settings of her previous fictions to the world of a glossy magazine, but she demystifies the glamour. The three women at the centre of the book are discontented in familiar ways. They are all in search of happiness but looking in the wrong places, when, of course, the place they have to look is inside themselves. </p> <p>'I am interested in damage,' says Marian Keyes. 'I am an alcoholic and I can't drink again; I write what I find, not what I think other people will like, though if they like it I am delighted. I am interested in brokenness and addiction. I think we live in addiction-ridden times. I don't just mean drink and drugs. I also mean dysfunctional relationships, spending money, eating, exercise, anything. Maybe there's a spiritual vacuum that is the motor for these addictions. I write about ordinary, damaged people. Of course, that must have something to do with what has happened to me. I often think that there are some people who are born without one layer of skin; who have a propensity for pain, who don't deal with life in a resilient way. </p> <p>'I have a friend, Suzanne, who used to be my flatmate, and she's just a straightforward, grand person. Life bounces off her. I would have loved to have been like that; that joyous embracing of life. But I'm not. I'm me. And although I still have my bleak and terrible days, I feel more acceptance of myself. I don't regret anything, even the most painful things. </p> <p>'Nothing happened,' she says.' 'There's nothing I can find to explain why I was always so very unhappy. I had a good upbringing. I love my family. My parents weren't drinkers. I was the oldest of five, and I think I took the burden, and worried when I didn't need to. I was a grand worrier. I hated being late. I used to wear my nightie over my school uniform so I wouldn't be late for school. Insane. Nobody ever told me off, so where did that agonising self-consciousness and fear come from? Between the ages of eight and 11 my family moved a lot - from Cork to Galway and then to Dublin - and I felt an outsider. I never really settled. And my adolescence - well, Jaysus. Oh Jaysus.' </p> <p>Her hands float to her mouth with the agony of memory. 'I was small. I looked young. I was smart. That was a bad combination. People underestimated me, so I was angry. Angry and anxious - that's an even worse combination. I hated the way I looked. My siblings were all fine - my brother, who's three years younger than me, was affable and easy-going. My sister, who was four years younger, was chatty, charismatic; I was fiercely jealous of her. I knew I was different. Sometimes I wonder if I was clinically depressed then - I remember at 11 I had a constant feeling of screaming despair, I felt there was an ominous sky nailed two inches from my head. I didn't talk to anyone about the way I felt. I must have been ashamed. I thought that everything would be all right when I was an adult. It wasn't.' </p> <p>By the time she left school, she was drinking: 'It's not the amount that matters, it's the fact that it was important to me. I already didn't understand how you could drink and not want to get drunk. It was oblivion I was after. And I was different when I drank; I felt more like the person I thought I was supposed to be. I knew I was witty, quite perceptive, I could tell a good story, I was clever. But I always got in the way of myself.' </p> <p>She drank through her law degree. She came to London, decided not to be a lawyer, drank though her job as an accounts clerk. Drank more and more, 'pouring fuel on the flames of my misery'. Lurched through dysfunctional relationships, behaved badly, tested all her loyal friends. 'I still had an infrastructure to my life. There were people who were very concerned about me; my boss and colleagues were incredibly kind and patient. And Suzanne. I didn't understand - none of us understood - that I couldn't stop without help. It wasn't a question of willpower. I didn't know that one was too many and a thousand never enough; I didn't know I was an alcoholic, which seems absurd in retrospect, but denial grows in tandem with the disease, and as the drinking increases so does the need to protect it. I knew I was unhappy and I thought that without drinking I would have nothing at all. I was beaten by alcohol.' </p> <p>The final four months of her drinking were the 'saddest and most awful of my life. I was constantly suicidal and I finally tried to kill myself' - an attempt with alcohol and pills which led to her salvation. 'Perhaps it was my cry for help; I was so crazed with pain - the pain of being alive.' She came out of hospital and booked into a rehabilitation centre in Dublin, spent six weeks there - 'and that was enough to set me on the path, though I still go to self-help groups. I had never lived through anything painful without the help of drink. Every time I was anxious, I would drink. After the rehab, every time something happened and I dealt with it, I grew up a bit more. And it was difficult, but it felt fantastic as well, like learning to drive a car: Feck, I'm doing it. I'm doing it! Look! Taking responsibility for myself and my life. It was grand, wonderful.' </p> <p>In 1994 she returned to London, where she remained for three years, before going home to Dublin. She had already started to write when at her most depressed and addled - 'but now I took it seriously'. She also became involved with the man whom she was to marry. 'Tony had been a friend for a long time, we had a good foundation of kindness and being mindful of each other. And I no longer needed a relationship, which was why I could have a good one at last. Before, I'd always been looking for fixes. Now I was no longer angry or scared or desperate. I was being grown-up. I was writing. I felt clean, a fledgling adult.' The success of Watermelon took her by surprise. 'It was such a buzz, though - to have come from a place where I'd been so bereft and to have produced something I was delighted with and which had come from my quirky, tormented head. I thought: well now, it's OK to be me.' </p> <p>She continues to be surprised by her success. She thinks it is luck, and knows that one day her luck might go. When she was offered her second large advance, one of her friends burst into tears, saying: 'It's going to change everything.' But Marian Keyes insists that it hasn't. 'I'm not materialistic. I have what I want, I love my house, I love my car. I have money for family and people I am close to. I am aware that money can be a corrupting and destructive thing, and I am mortified that the people who sell and buy my books might feel I'm somehow not the same as them, and I am the same. I'm very close to my family, who treat me the same as they always have. I have a tight circle of friends. They are happy for me; they're secure in their own lives so why would they begrudge me? </p> <p>'People tell me I'm not going to win the Booker, and that's true, but there are different ways of having one's work validated. I respect what I do; I don't take myself seriously but I take my writing seriously. I'm not part of the Irish literary \"milieu\" [she puts on a fancy voice]. Jaysus, I'd be craven with fear. I stay close to my roots because that's where I'm happy to be. If my writing stopped, because I couldn't do it any more or because people no longer wanted to read it, I'd be upset. But there are other things in life. Travel - we could sell the house and buy a camper van. Or Tony and I both want to work with human rights somehow - we're bleeding-heart liberals really.' </p> <p>Three years ago, she and Tony bought this house, with its big rooms and a view (if you stand on tiptoes) of the sea. Tony - a Cambridge graduate and a computer analyst - gave up his work in order to work for her, 'clearing the decks' (she calls him 'ego-less' and says their working relationship is a 'partnership'). A year and a half ago - everything in place, the house decorated to make your eyes water, the room waiting - they started trying to have a baby. Nothing happened, and now they are seeing a specialist. 'It's like a syndrome,' she says. 'Women in their thirties who've put their families on hold, finding that it doesn't happen so easily. People tell me not to worry - but you know what, I'm not worrying. If it doesn't happen, I'll be very sad. And Tony, he'd be a wonderful father, he's so gentle, kind. But the two of us get on well and we will deal with it. I haven't written about it yet.' </p> <p>I ask what her next book is about and she says, 'It's about a woman who has had two miscarriages, and she's...' Her round eyes get rounder. 'Well. I never thought of that. Isn't that the strangest thing? So I am writing about it after all.' </p> <p>She insists that she will remain unaltered by success. 'I'm not better or worse for it, just luckier. And I've had to learn the dangers of not tying your self-esteem on to something that is so mutable. Failure is painful but survivable. I know that now. Shit happens to everyone. Sure, there'll be more shit coming my way. I just hope that now I can deal with it. I'm grateful for what I have, but it doesn't make me immune. Feck it, nobody is immune from life.' </p> <p>\u0095 To order Sushi for Beginners (Michael Joseph, \u00a316.99) for \u00a313.99, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171</p>",

I ask what her next book is about and she says, 'It's about a woman who has had two miscarriages, and she's...' Her round eyes get rounder. 'Well. I never thought of that. Isn't that the strangest thing? So I am writing about it after all.' She insists that she will remain unaltered by success. 'I'm not better or worse for it, just luckier. And I've had to learn the dangers of not tying your self-esteem on to something that is so mutable. Failure is painful but survivable. I know that now. Shit happens to everyone. Sure, there'll be more shit coming my way. I just hope that now I can deal with it. I'm grateful for what I have, but it doesn't make me immune. Feck it, nobody is immune from life.' \u0095 To order Sushi for Beginners (Michael Joseph, \u00a316.99) for \u00a313.99, call Observer CultureShop on 0800 3168 171",

      "body": "<p>With this house business going on and on (and on and on), I've been given to moments of defeatism. These have been some of the favourite moments in my life: the great rush of relief at ditching some cherished project, of crushing it into a tight ball and pitching it gaily into the incinerator.</p> <p>There is no greater pleasure I know than in uncommitting myself. That's it, I'm not doing it. It's virtually a definition of happiness. I love giving up. So, 'I've had it with houses - I'm staying where I am' comes easily to me. About once a week or so. To which my friends and the Poet reply: 'But what about love?' 'Not worth it. Don't care. And anyway, everyone knows I know nothing about love. It's not what I do.'</p> <p>But there must be something in this love stuff, because so far I've only thrown the tantrums. I haven't actually cancelled the house sale and purchase even though it's more emotionally distressing than Christmas. Not even when I found myself locked out of the Poet's house last week, completely at a loss in the wild and unfamiliar streets of Cambridge. I might as well have been in the rainforest of Borneo.</p> <p>So far, Cambridge has consisted of the Poet's house, the fa\u00e7ade of the house opposite, which might one of these days be mine, and the street at the end of the road - the furthest I've made it on my own in order to visit my solicitor and (more important) the Italian deli. Beyond that, it's a mystery.</p> <p>I have been driven here and there to dinner parties - they seem to have a lot of them in Cambridge - and to the Poet's college, but I was born without any direction-finding equipment. Drive me somewhere 15 times and I couldn't begin to find my way to it, especially if thousands of cyclists are throwing themselves in front of you and there are more one-ways than there are streets.</p> <p>I haven't the faintest idea where my new house is in relation to anywhere else, and even less notion of how to get there beyond hailing a taxi, which apparently you can't do in the provinces. I have taken trains all round the States, wandered happily here and there in Paris or Buenos Aires, but Britain defeats me.</p> <p>Home, for me, is about staying in. After 53 years of living in London, I still get lost sometimes, and now refuse to go anywhere that isn't on the 24 bus route. But in London, at least, there's an underground system and an A-Z if the worst happens and I find myself out.</p> <p>All I had to do was get to the Poet's college and collect a key, but how to get there? I stood hopefully beside a desultory bus stop for a while and then asked some people standing nearby which bus went into the centre. They looked astonished. 'Bus, what bus? Don't know. Never taken the bus.'</p> <p>Is this because the bus never comes or they never go to any other part of Cambridge? I wandered down the road and found an internet caf\u00e9. I emailed the poet to email me a cab number and sat with a cup of tea to wait for a reply. Someone who everyone greeted as Bernard sat at my table.</p> <p>'This is your first time here,' he told me. Dear God, this is definitely not London, I thought, feeling curious eyes swivelling in my direction.</p> <p>'I can't make it to your poetry reading, tonight,' a woman at an adjacent table excused herself to Bernard, looking up from a book.</p> <p>'What are you reading?' he asked her.</p> <p>She held it up.

      "bodyText": "With this house business going on and on (and on and on), I've been given to moments of defeatism. These have been some of the favourite moments in my life: the great rush of relief at ditching some cherished project, of crushing it into a tight ball and pitching it gaily into the incinerator. There is no greater pleasure I know than in uncommitting myself. That's it, I'm not doing it. It's virtually a definition of happiness. I love giving up. So, 'I've had it with houses - I'm staying where I am' comes easily to me. About once a week or so. To which my friends and the Poet reply: 'But what about love?' 'Not worth it. Don't care. And anyway, everyone knows I know nothing about love. It's not what I do.' But there must be something in this love stuff, because so far I've only thrown the tantrums. I haven't actually cancelled the house sale and purchase even though it's more emotionally distressing than Christmas. Not even when I found myself locked out of the Poet's house last week, completely at a loss in the wild and unfamiliar streets of Cambridge. I might as well have been in the rainforest of Borneo. So far, Cambridge has consisted of the Poet's house, the fa\u00e7ade of the house opposite, which might one of these days be mine, and the street at the end of the road - the furthest I've made it on my own in order to visit my solicitor and (more important) the Italian deli. Beyond that, it's a mystery. I have been driven here and there to dinner parties - they seem to have a lot of them in Cambridge - and to the Poet's college, but I was born without any direction-finding equipment. Drive me somewhere 15 times and I couldn't begin to find my way to it, especially if thousands of cyclists are throwing themselves in front of you and there are more one-ways than there are streets. I haven't the faintest idea where my new house is in relation to anywhere else, and even less notion of how to get there beyond hailing a taxi, which apparently you can't do in the provinces. I have taken trains all round the States, wandered happily here and there in Paris or Buenos Aires, but Britain defeats me. Home, for me, is about staying in. After 53 years of living in London, I still get lost sometimes, and now refuse to go anywhere that isn't on the 24 bus route. But in London, at least, there's an underground system and an A-Z if the worst happens and I find myself out. All I had to do was get to the Poet's college and collect a key, but how to get there? I stood hopefully beside a desultory bus stop for a while and then asked some people standing nearby which bus went into the centre. They looked astonished. 'Bus, what bus? Don't know. Never taken the bus.' Is this because the bus never comes or they never go to any other part of Cambridge? I wandered down the road and found an internet caf\u00e9. I emailed the poet to email me a cab number and sat with a cup of tea to wait for a reply. Someone who everyone greeted as Bernard sat at my table. 'This is your first time here,' he told me. Dear God, this is definitely not London, I thought, feeling curious eyes swivelling in my direction. 'I can't make it to your poetry reading, tonight,' a woman at an adjacent table excused herself to Bernard, looking up from a book. 'What are you reading?' he asked her. She held it up. It was a history of English literature. 'Researching into the Mountains of Mourne,' she told him with a meaningful smile. 'Ah yes,' Bernard nodded, sadder and wiser. 'The Mountains of Mourne. Yes, the Mountains of Mourne.' This is not the sort of casual conversation that goes on in my local greasy spoon. I sprinted for the computer to find the return email with a cab number. What am I doing here? I wondered while waiting for the cab to arrive. What do I like about London? Anonymity. I like sitting in caf\u00e9s and not knowing a soul. I like being on the street in the sure and certain knowledge that no one will say hello to me. At my next- door neighbour's party recently, a woman who lived further down the street told me definitively that I didn't live where I had in fact lived for 15 years, because she'd been living there that long and never seen me before.

Could I cope with this, or any degree of sociability? Did I want a house in an utterly strange city where everyone knows each other? And all in the name of what people keep insisting on calling love. When I arrived at the Poet's room, he wrapped me in his arms, knowing that my mental condition was touch-and-go after the trauma of enforced being out. 'I'll drive you home.

      "body": "<p><strong> What were you doing when you first started going to movies and thinking 'this is wonderful'?</strong> </p> <p>I think I was being shunned by my peers. So movies were really an escape. Then I started writing comedy film scripts as a teenager. I grew up in a small town on the north coast of New South Wales, called Tweed Heads, which I later mocked mercilessly in Muriel's Wedding. </p> <p><strong> What took you from writing screenplays as a hobby to treating it more seriously?</strong> </p> <p>I had an interview with the careers adviser at my school, the Tweed River High. I turned up for the meeting and he wasn't there. So I went to his filing cabinet and looked up 'Film'. There was a file with only one thing in it: a handbook for the Australian Film and Television School. So I stole it. I applied on impulse and got in even though I was only 17. </p> <p>[Hogan's contemporaries at film school included Jane Campion (The Piano) and his future wife Jocelyn Moorhouse (Proof). Although an award-winning student director, he spent the decade after graduating writing for television.] </p> <p><strong> What was the inspiration for Muriel's Wedding? </strong> </p> <p>I had been working on another script for two or three years but the finance fell through at the last minute. I was devastated. And that was my lowest point - in the late Eighties. So I decided I would write something I knew a lot about and that was feeling like a flop. I've always said Muriel was me; but in fact the story was inspired by my sister. </p> <p><strong> She was still living in Tweed Heads?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. She and my father had a very stormy relationship. They had got her a job selling cosmetics but she embezzled money from him, forging his signature on cheques. And when the shit hit the fan, she disappeared. She was missing for almost a year. Then finally she called me. She'd been living in Sydney for a year with a friend but was too scared to contact anyone because she'd stolen close to A$15,000 and there was no way she could pay it back. I felt that was a good beginning for a story. I had also been toying with this idea for a story of a young girl who longs to get married. And then I put the two together. </p> <p><strong> What were you living on while you were writing Muriel? Were you having a hard time financially?</strong> </p> <p>Oh yeah. Jocelyn and I were both broke. Her career was not much healthier than mine at that time. I became unemployable in television because I was too stubborn. I wrote a very detailed 30-page treatment for Muriel's Wedding. Then I sent it into the Australian Film Commission, asking for A$5,000 to write the screenplay. They told me that this should never be made; that it was terrible. I eventually got some money from another smaller funding body. I wrote the screenplay in three months. And then it took another two years to get it made! </p> <p>[In 1991 Moorhouse's debut film, Proof, was an international hit. The success enabled the couple to tour festivals and production companies around the world trying to raise money to make Muriel's Wedding.] </p> <p><strong> How did you find a chink in the wall of indifference you'd been encountering?</strong> </p> <p>I was getting very close to giving up but there was one company we hadn't tried: Ciby 2000. They'd just made The Piano, which was a huge success. But they preferred to work with established directors such as Mike Leigh and David Lynch. On the day the board were to make their decision, a contact told us we were likely to be turned down. I rang Jane Campion and asked her to write a gushing letter about me. She faxed it to the president of the company. He read the script immediately, said yes and we had our money. It was extraordinary. I was going to dedicate the film to Jane but eventually I just thanked her in the end credits because I thought she would find it too embarrassing. But without Jane it really would never have been made. </p> <p><strong> Were there any other parts of the jigsaw that you had to put together before you could get the film under way? For example, the music?</strong> </p> <p>That came later. I didn't pursue Abba for their permission until we had the money. Then they said no. And we found out that Abba had never licensed their music to anyone else. We sent them a screenplay with a letter begging them to read it. We got a message from their assistant saying: 'They won't read it, and even if they did, it would still be \"No\".' So Lynda House (producer) asked the assistant to read it, and she did, and she loved it. So she said: 'Look, I don't know if I can promise you anything because they have never said yes, but I'll tell you what to do. Keep up the flattering letters.' So I did, and she got them to read the screenplay. They liked it. But they still said no. We just kept at them. I would send them a letter once a week. And I was shameless. I compared them to the Beatles. I think I called them good looking. Finally I said to Lynda: 'I can't replace them. I'm going to fly to Sweden and hang out on their doorstep till they say yes to me.' Lynda said: 'Before we do that, let's warn them that you are coming so that they're there.' She sent them a photocopy of my air ticket and they said yes. I had to have Abba. What would the film have been without Abba? It's Muriel's music! </p> <p><strong> After the struggle to raise the money, how did you begin to cast the movie?</strong> </p> <p>We cast for a very long time. We started looking very early, before pre-production. We all knew it was going to be hard to cast Muriel. I think I saw every young actress in Australia. Toni Collette had had a lot of difficulty getting work because she didn't look like everybody else. When she came in I thought she's really good but I wasn't sure she was right. And I went on looking for Muriel for another month. I think I needed to see all these other people to prove that it was her. Toni desperately wanted the role and I was asking a great deal. I wanted an actress who was ready to gain weight because I knew there was going to be a scene where she was dressed in a white satin pant suit and you couldn't fake her thighs. And Toni was willing to do it. She said: 'I'll be paid to gain weight for this. That will make it a pleasure.' But I don't think she found it a pleasure in the end. </p> <p><strong> Given the story was partly inspired by events in your own family, were the locations important to you?</strong> </p> <p>Porpoise Spit itself was shot in my home town. I was a little embarrassed that my Dad would recognise himself as a character [Muriel's father]. And if I showed his town then that would be a dead giveaway. But it was the only town that looked right in the frame. I also thought, it has to be Tweed Heads because Tweed Heads was the inspiration for the story. </p> <p><strong> There is a lot of dark and light in the script. Did you try to reflect this in the look of the film? For example, the bright, cartoon colours of the beach and clubs contrasted to the gloomy interiors of Muriel's parents' home?</strong> </p> <p>We did talk a lot about colour. The thing about the Gold Coast is that they like their entertainment gaudy: everything is brash and 'in your face'. So I knew that there would be no such thing as bad taste when it came to the decor. With the Heslop house, where the family lived, I knew I wanted an open kitchen and the lounge room off the kitchen - because that's the kind of kitchen I grew up in. </p> <p><strong> Did things go to plan during the shoot?</strong> </p> <p>No. There were lots of disasters. We had three or four days in Queensland and we were going to shoot the exteriors of Porpoise Spit. The three days when I needed sunshine, we were hit with terrible storms. That it worked at all is a tribute to the actors. They were freezing. But they made it look hot! </p> <p><strong> How did you feel about the first cut?</strong> </p> <p>It was terrible. It didn't work, it had no rhythm, the performances weren't shaped. It just looked shocking. I didn't know that everybody's first cut is like this. We were rushing because we wanted to make Cannes. If you want to be noticed, particularly in Australia, you'd better be in the Cannes Festival. Australians don't like Australian movies unless somebody else says they're OK. But what really surprised me was its success everywhere else. I mean, I didn't expect it to do as well as it did in England and the US, because at the end of the day it really is an Australian film, full of Australian characters. So that was a big lesson to me: if you have the right story there is no such thing as 'too parochial'. </p> <p><strong> Was it a simple step to get more films to direct?</strong> </p> <p>I always say that with Muriel I became a director whose next film was anticipated rather than feared. It changed everything. And the moment it changed was the night it screened at Cannes. It just went through the roof. The audience were screaming and clapping, it got a 15-minute standing ovation. Toni Collette was with me; and she had lost all the weight she'd put on for the film. Her dream, she told me, was that she would appear at Cannes, thin. I went on stage first and then Toni came on. And for a moment you could tell the audience didn't know who she was. And then when they recognised her, the applause just went on and on. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an extract from 'My First Movie', edited by Stephen Lowenstein, published by Faber on 6 November at \u00a312.99.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A couple of years ago, Joaquin Phoenix was starring in Return To Paradise, a film about a trio of American tourists who get caught with a brick of hash in Malaysia. So Phoenix turned up on set looking every bit as skinny as a guy who has spent too long in an unhealthy prison would do. Impressed, and feeling he could do with being a little less porky himself, director Joseph Ruben asked how he could replicate the feat. 'Just stop eating,' Phoenix suggested. </p> <p>While it can't be easy being the brother of a dead icon, Joaquin Phoenix is establishing himself as a substantial figure in his own right. Earlier this year, his creepy turn as Commodus in Gladiator gave him a taste of the Hollywood big time. </p> <p>And he is in two very different films showing at the London Film Festival: playing a smooth criminal in the moody New York drama The Yards, and a priest in Quills, one of the two Marquis De Sade films doing the rounds. In all these parts, he brings a brooding quality that Yards director James Gray suggests is evidence of an 'inner Beelzebub'. </p> <p>Phoenix himself has a brighter take on it. 'It's always fun to do really intense characters like that. I love creating them, coming up with the hairstyle, the TNT...' </p> <p>It's not hard to see where he could draw the dark emotions from. </p> <p>Joaquin was at the Viper Room on the night his elder brother River took a fatal drug cocktail, and was the one who called the ambulance. Understandably, he doesn't like to talk about it. 'I've come nearer acceptance - I wouldn't say understanding, because it's something I'll never understand - but just an acceptance of River's death.' </p> <p>Joaquin Phoenix was born in Puerto Rico in 1974.

      "bodyText": "A couple of years ago, Joaquin Phoenix was starring in Return To Paradise, a film about a trio of American tourists who get caught with a brick of hash in Malaysia. So Phoenix turned up on set looking every bit as skinny as a guy who has spent too long in an unhealthy prison would do. Impressed, and feeling he could do with being a little less porky himself, director Joseph Ruben asked how he could replicate the feat. 'Just stop eating,' Phoenix suggested. While it can't be easy being the brother of a dead icon, Joaquin Phoenix is establishing himself as a substantial figure in his own right. Earlier this year, his creepy turn as Commodus in Gladiator gave him a taste of the Hollywood big time. And he is in two very different films showing at the London Film Festival: playing a smooth criminal in the moody New York drama The Yards, and a priest in Quills, one of the two Marquis De Sade films doing the rounds. In all these parts, he brings a brooding quality that Yards director James Gray suggests is evidence of an 'inner Beelzebub'. Phoenix himself has a brighter take on it. 'It's always fun to do really intense characters like that. I love creating them, coming up with the hairstyle, the TNT...' It's not hard to see where he could draw the dark emotions from. Joaquin was at the Viper Room on the night his elder brother River took a fatal drug cocktail, and was the one who called the ambulance. Understandably, he doesn't like to talk about it. 'I've come nearer acceptance - I wouldn't say understanding, because it's something I'll never understand - but just an acceptance of River's death.' Joaquin Phoenix was born in Puerto Rico in 1974. At the time, his parents were missionaries for the Children Of God cult. Wanting to be more like his siblings (his sisters are called Rain, Liberty and Summer) the young boy changed his name to Leaf. After leaving the cult while living in Venezuela, the family stowed away on a container ship full of toys. Back in the US, the siblings started busking, and the family moved to California so they could break into the entertainment industry. Leaf made his TV debut age eight. In 1989, when he had a part in the film Parenthood, he seemed to catching up with his brother's success, but then he vanished to Mexico to be with his father, and returned calling himself Joaquin again.

Five things you should know about Joaquin Phoenix 1 He claims most people who 'recognise' him are mistaking him for iconoclastic actor/director Vincent Gallo. 2 Joaquin is a Spanish name that is (roughly) pronounced 'Wah-keen' (and certainly never 'Jo-a-kin'). 3 His vegan beliefs mean he can never wear leather costumes: this has caused problems. 4 He came up with the name Leaf while helping his father rake leaves. 5 He was the person who called the emergency services the night his brother River collapsed.",

You might think that as one of England's finest and most-quoted poets Blake has never been away, but it isn't so. He was roundly ignored in his lifetime. Wordsworth thought him mad, a judgment that remained common even among such enthusiasts as Swinburne and GK Chesterton. The swell of popular interest in his work in the 60s faded with the decade, perhaps because his aphorism about opening 'the doors of perception' had been over-quoted by acid-gobblers like Jim Morrison. The cult of Blake subsided, though his name was periodically evoked by pop artists such as Van Morrison and Paul Weller. </p> <p>Yet here is the Tate exhibition, following on the heels of Peter Ackroyd's magnificent biography. And here is 'Jerusalem', Blake's visionary anthem to his homeland, blaring from our screens every time the England football team take to the turf. 'And did those feet in ancient times', it seems, was actually a far-sighted reference to England's 1966 win. </p> <p>By happy synchronicity, 'Jerusalem' is in vogue as the debate about national identity grows more heated by the month. With the UK's Celtic regions spinning off into semi-autonomy, and our royalty discredited, 'Jerusalem' has become prime contender for the English national anthem. </p> <p>The prospect doesn't delight everyone. For many, Blake's lines are a piece of push-button patriotism, forever tainted by association with the Tory Party, Chariots of Fire, and Elgar's 'Land of Hope and Glory' (it was Elgar who orchestrated Hubert Parry's music into the terrace chorus we know). The Left, while keen on dispensing with 'dark satanic mills', remains suspicious of any 'countenance divine', and the Labour Party's long-standing intention to build 'the New Jerusalem' is rarely glimpsed on the Blairite agenda. </p> <p>Yet as Iain Sinclair remarks below, there are many Blakes on offer. It's a mark of Blake's genius, his universality, that he unites such diverse enthusiasts. Science writers such as Bronowski and Dawkins, Marxists such as EP Thompson, Jungians such as Kathleen Raine, poets such as WB Yeats and Allen Ginsberg (who as a young man heard Blake sing to him), Avalonians such as John Michell, jazzers such as Mike Westbrook and filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch have all summoned Blake's utopian spirit to their causes. </p> <p>Why is Blake back? Because we sense in his texts and paintings, poems and prophecies, in his arduous but committed life, a glimpse of the fully human, of the transcendent entwined with earthly realities. 'Innocence' or 'Experience', 'England' or 'Albion' - sing whichever of his songs touches your heart.</p> <p><strong>Iain Sinclair, novelist</strong></p> <p>William Blake of Soho. Child Blake seeing angels in a tree on Peckham Rye. Naked Blake reciting Paradise Lost in a leafy Lambeth bower. Blake the engraver, in old age, walking to Hampstead. Blake singing on his deathbed in Fountain's Court. Blake, lying with his wife Catherine, in Bunhill Fields. Blake the prophet. Blake the psychogeographer. Blake the red-cap revolutionary, watching Newgate burn. Blake the happy-clappy revivalist of Glad Day, banging a tambourine with Michael Horowitz. Blake, at the last night of the proms, burning in the mad eyes of sentimental imperialists. </p> <p>We force the poet on to a Procrustean bed, squeezing and shaping him to fit our fantasies. We insist on seeing him as a London figure, coeval with Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, Henry VIII. Blake declines into a heritage token, an emblem to be bolted on to the bonnet of any old banger.</p> <p>What we should go back to, and what can serve us still, is the work; the great, complex freewheeling derangements of the prophetic books, the savage wisdom of the parables, the unnerving directness of the lyrics.</p> <p>There is no reason on earth why Blake, his poetry or his art, should be of any use. It was never his business to be useful. Shovels are useful. Paper clips are useful. Blake astounds, terrifies, delights. He gives us a richer sense of ourselves and of our city. His presence animates certain dusty corners. The incantatory rhythms of his poems drum in our heads and fire our blood. He doesn't grant entrance to a lost garden of time. He challenges us to risk everything, the kind of possession he himself underwent when he rewrote Milton, became Milton, revised his errors. Blake is there and the rest is up to us. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate</strong></p> <p>Blake is no less a writer than our other 'national poets', but in certain respects a more difficult one - if we look at poems other than the Songs of Innocence and Experience, that is. Living at a sharp angle to life, he often told the truth by telling it slant. This is what makes his work so admirable in all respects: he is always his own man, yet always concerned with the common experience. His greatness is incontestable - at once highly original, and utterly humane.</p> <p><strong>Tom Paulin, poet and critic</strong></p> <p>Blake was important to me when I was growing up in Belfast in the 1960s, as he was to Van Morrison, another Blakean. He subsequently went rather out of fashion, perhaps because there was a lot of literary criticism by people like Northrop Frye which was full of Jungian archetypes, and Jung was a Nazi sympathiser. There was also the lack of a historical version of Blake; David Erdman's book, Prophet Against Empire, showed that Tyger is about the French and American revolutions. At the time that Enoch Powell made his 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968, the Bishop of Woolwich, John Robinson, said that if Christ had come back, as Blake mentions in Jerusalem, he would have been turned back by the immigration officers. Powell replied that the poem was blasphemous. Jerusalem is an affirmation of English or British freedom. It's done in a way that is not ethically exclusive - and you think of Blake's sympathy with black slaves. Blake is a great, radical, dissenting, one-nation English poet. </p> <p><strong>Billy Bragg, singer </strong><br>People often see belligerence and justification for militarism in Jerusalem's line, 'nor shall my sword sleep in my hand' - partly because Hubert Parry wrote the music for Jerusalem during the First World War, and gave it a rousing atmosphere - but Blake is talking of a 'mental fight', about the force of conscience. He's arming himself with his spiritual beliefs against the industrial revolution, when people who were living at the pace of nature were being forced to live at the pace of capital. For me, the song is asking what would Jesus Christ have said if he had returned then, how could Christian values exist in industrialism? </p> <p>My song 'Upfield' was inspired partly by Blake; I borrowed events from his life for the song's narrator, such as putting him on Primrose Hill seeing angels. It's about moving from an ideological argument for a better society to a more humanitarian vision; a socialism of the heart, the kind of compassion I find in Blake.</p> <p><strong>Sir John Tavener, composer</strong></p> <p>Blake's use of tradition, his 'liquid' poetic theology, and the fact that he believed that all traditions and 'sacred codes' have placed man under a divine order - this is what has most deeply inspired me about Blake. For instance, in The Lamb, he describes the eternal world of Light and in The Tyger, he is concerned with 'Hell, or energy', and 'the terrors of the Abyss'. But above all, in all his work, he refers to Jesus as the 'Imagination'. The western world understands nothing of this.</p> <p>He is relevant, precisely because the world today knows nothing of these things. Our world is a smouldering junkyard which believes that innovation and 'mental things are alone real'. This is its tragedy and its abyss. 'Let him who appears wise in this world become a fool, that he may become wise.' This is what Blake did, and all of us should follow him.</p> <p>Today, we live in a culture in ruins. We, with our pathetic ego-centred imaginations can conceive of neither source nor symbol. 'For everything that lives is holy,' wrote Blake; but we continue to commit mass genocide and to systematically destroy 'everything that is holy'. 'Awake! Awake O sleeper of the land of shadows. Wake! Expand!'</p> <p>We would indeed be poverty-stricken without Blake. After all, he lived in a secular and flippant humanistic age, and he alone in that age understood that 'the artist is an inhabitant of that happy country' - in other words, the artist of paradise.</p> <p><strong>Alan Moore, graphic novelist</strong></p> <p>I read Blake at O level, but studied him seriously when I was researching From Hell, my book about Jack the Ripper, which has lots of references to Blake; him seeing a spectre at his house in Hercules Road, for example. Blake represents the visionary heroism of the imagination. He was living in a London which was not much more than a squalid horse toilet, on which he superimposed a magnificent four-fold city and populated it with angels, and philosophers of the past. Art at its best has the power to insist on a different reality.</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Paulin's lecture on Blake is at Tate Britain on 22 November at 6.30pm. The Orchestra of the Royal College of Music, conducted by Neil Thomson, the Elysian Singers, and soprano Patricia Rozario will perform a concert of music by Sir John Tavener at St John's, Smith Square, London SW1 on 28 November.

No sleep. No social life. No time. Nothing.

'We all bang on about parenting being the most important job,' said Brian Waller of Home Start. 'But we all fall far short of recognising the difficulties that parents have.' One in five parents said no one warned them of exhaustion in the years after a birth, nor that parenting can wreck relationships. No personal time and suddenly shouldering huge responsibility were other surprises. 'After I had my first baby I was terribly isolated and felt I had no friends,' said Lindsay Jones from Loughborough, Leicestershire, a retail project manager until she gave up work in 1995. 'It went on for months, it was awful. I just didn't expect it to be like that. 'I had trouble sleeping. The baby was crying into the night. I was exhausted all the time. It got worse when our second child was born. I looked after the babies properly but everything else went to pieces. It's seen as shameful if you can't cope, but it was all so unexpected.' Karen Scott, from Oban, Argyll, said: 'Even though I had been a nurse for seven years before I had children, I just wasn't prepared for the actual reality. No sleep. No social life. No time. Nothing. Being a parent was a complete shock to the system.' Evidence of parental trauma comes as the Government invests \u00a3500 million in parenting classes. Parents of under-fours in 60 trial areas have already been offered 'Sure Start' training in how to get a baby to sleep and how to cope with difficult children. Since 1998, interest in the 'child-free' movement has exploded in the UK and US. No Kidding, a group for adults who say childbearing is 'over-rated' now has chapters in 47 American cities and launched its first UK branch in Manchester last year.",

      "bodyText": "Rosemary West, who was jailed for life in 1995 for the murder of 10 girls and women, yesterday made a formal application to have her conviction reviewed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. West, 46, has submitted a skeleton argument to the CCRC, the body responsible for referring suspected miscarriages of justice to the Court of Appeal, her lawyer revealed last night. Her legal team is seeking to prove she did not receive a fair trial when she was convicted of the killings in the house she shared with her husband, Fred, in Cromwell Street, Gloucester. It is understood that part of the argument submitted centres on crucial photographic evidence that could prove that Fred - who killed himself in prison - was the sole killer. The Polaroid pictures, contained in an album, were allegedly not disclosed at her murder trial at Winchester Crown Court. At the time it was claimed they had been destroyed, which the defence team say prevented them from using them in evidence to possibly exonerate West. Lawyers also claim that under the terms of the new Human Rights Act, the pre-trial news coverage and approaches by the press to witnesses prevented her from getting a fair trial. Possible misdirection by the trial judge, Mr Justice Mantell, in relation to payments to witnesses, is another issue raised by the defence. West's solicitor, Leo Goatley, confirmed he had faxed a skeleton argument supporting an application to the CCRC. He said: 'The casefile documents are so extensive that I cannot put them in the post. I am going to have to drive to Birmingham to deliver them to the commission in person.' An application by West for leave to appeal against her conviction was dismissed in March 1996 by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor. She is serving her sentence at Durham Prison.",

      "body": "<p>This is the entrance we've been waiting for. If we were, in fact, watching an actual opera, rather than simply being high-paying spectators to the prolonged thrashings of bloodied elitist melodramatic footshootery that make up the real-life tale of the Royal Opera House, then this is the point where we'd happily put down the boiled sweets, ignore the doubtless incomprehensible programme notes [Augsburg, 1756. Three years in it is to the famous War of the Helvetian Pantaloon and so Franz, a shepherd ...] and listen, thankfully, to the closing caterwaul from the irrelevant third milkmaid. The real action is, at last, about to begin.</p> <p>Raymond Gubbay starts sotto voce, emerging surprisingly tremulous from the wings. The self-appointed scourge of Covent Garden, an absurdly successful populist impresario of operas in his own right, who has now taken his long-standing critique of the ROH shambles to its logical end by applying, formally, for the vacant post of executive director there, does not come in with a crash of cymbals; he is hesitant, soft-voiced, thoughtful in his manner and, in the end, his criticisms are all the more coruscating for it.</p> <p>So when he speaks, for instance, of the way in which Peter Gummer and Mary Allen, after handing out \u00a378.5 million to the House from their positions on the Arts Council, then simply 'walked round the table to collect it', becoming chairman and chief executive of the House within a year, his voice grows quieter, not louder. It was, he almost whispers, 'a truly appalling piece of history. There they were with their snouts in the trough, in receipt of the same money they'd just allocated... if that had happened in a Third World country we'd all be sneering. But it happens over here and we just say: \"Oh, jolly good luck to them.\"' By the end, I am straining to hear his measured words. And ROH chairman Sir Colin Southgate - the man who said he didn't want to go to the opera 'to sit next to somebody in a singlet, a pair of shorts and a smelly pair of trainers' - and the rest of his board should strain still further, for this application, and the points raised therein, are made in deadly seriousness, and are bound to shake much welcome air into the Covent Garden debate.</p> <p>They won't like Gubbay there. Thirty-three years at the sharp end of promoting, and most of it highly successful, despite critical sneers at his 'tacky' mid-Nineties stagings of La Boh\u00e8me and Carmen. They won't like him, but they should listen, because they have something of a history of gross malmanagement. It was the hilariously observed BBC documentary The House which first alerted us a few years ago to the arrogance, the elitism, the Gothic stupidity - but it didn't seem to alert them. Since then we've had the Gummer shambles, the Allen shambles, their enforced shambolic resignations, the two-year closure shambles, the touring shambles and the constant losing-of-vast-amounts-of-public-money shambles. The eventual reopening was hailed in some quarters as a success, but six months later the apparent saviour, Michael Kaiser, resigned, and ticket prices are still seen as ludicrously high - for those who can get the ones not already taken by the House's well-off 'Friends'. A third of the seats have a poor view of the stage, and the word 'shambles' still hovers nearby, waiting to alight at any time.</p> <p>Why, I asked Gubbay, did no one seem to learn? He sighed. 'Partly because there is no political will to do anything about it. And partly because the board, by and large, with I suppose some honourable exceptions, appear to leave their brains behind when they step through the stage door: they are in awe of the setting, the ambience, the fact that it's great art, and sensible business practices are thrown away. The House is a gem, a priceless gem. But you have to remember that it began in another time, another century, when people went to the opera simply to be seen. And I wonder whether that's changed at all. They hold so many seats for the Friends, supporters who pay for the privilege, that they've disenfranchised a lot of people, and after all this is funded at the rate of \u00a320m a year for the benefit of everyone.</p> <p>'An audience can always be had for popular opera, well done, at a decent price. There are huge audiences out there. But the House's problem isn't just that it hasn't penetrated that audience; it doesn't want to penetrate that audience.

      "bodyText": "This is the entrance we've been waiting for. If we were, in fact, watching an actual opera, rather than simply being high-paying spectators to the prolonged thrashings of bloodied elitist melodramatic footshootery that make up the real-life tale of the Royal Opera House, then this is the point where we'd happily put down the boiled sweets, ignore the doubtless incomprehensible programme notes [Augsburg, 1756. Three years in it is to the famous War of the Helvetian Pantaloon and so Franz, a shepherd ...] and listen, thankfully, to the closing caterwaul from the irrelevant third milkmaid. The real action is, at last, about to begin. Raymond Gubbay starts sotto voce, emerging surprisingly tremulous from the wings. The self-appointed scourge of Covent Garden, an absurdly successful populist impresario of operas in his own right, who has now taken his long-standing critique of the ROH shambles to its logical end by applying, formally, for the vacant post of executive director there, does not come in with a crash of cymbals; he is hesitant, soft-voiced, thoughtful in his manner and, in the end, his criticisms are all the more coruscating for it. So when he speaks, for instance, of the way in which Peter Gummer and Mary Allen, after handing out \u00a378.5 million to the House from their positions on the Arts Council, then simply 'walked round the table to collect it', becoming chairman and chief executive of the House within a year, his voice grows quieter, not louder. It was, he almost whispers, 'a truly appalling piece of history. There they were with their snouts in the trough, in receipt of the same money they'd just allocated... if that had happened in a Third World country we'd all be sneering. But it happens over here and we just say: \"Oh, jolly good luck to them.\"' By the end, I am straining to hear his measured words. And ROH chairman Sir Colin Southgate - the man who said he didn't want to go to the opera 'to sit next to somebody in a singlet, a pair of shorts and a smelly pair of trainers' - and the rest of his board should strain still further, for this application, and the points raised therein, are made in deadly seriousness, and are bound to shake much welcome air into the Covent Garden debate. They won't like Gubbay there. Thirty-three years at the sharp end of promoting, and most of it highly successful, despite critical sneers at his 'tacky' mid-Nineties stagings of La Boh\u00e8me and Carmen. They won't like him, but they should listen, because they have something of a history of gross malmanagement. It was the hilariously observed BBC documentary The House which first alerted us a few years ago to the arrogance, the elitism, the Gothic stupidity - but it didn't seem to alert them. Since then we've had the Gummer shambles, the Allen shambles, their enforced shambolic resignations, the two-year closure shambles, the touring shambles and the constant losing-of-vast-amounts-of-public-money shambles. The eventual reopening was hailed in some quarters as a success, but six months later the apparent saviour, Michael Kaiser, resigned, and ticket prices are still seen as ludicrously high - for those who can get the ones not already taken by the House's well-off 'Friends'. A third of the seats have a poor view of the stage, and the word 'shambles' still hovers nearby, waiting to alight at any time. Why, I asked Gubbay, did no one seem to learn? He sighed. 'Partly because there is no political will to do anything about it. And partly because the board, by and large, with I suppose some honourable exceptions, appear to leave their brains behind when they step through the stage door: they are in awe of the setting, the ambience, the fact that it's great art, and sensible business practices are thrown away. The House is a gem, a priceless gem. But you have to remember that it began in another time, another century, when people went to the opera simply to be seen. And I wonder whether that's changed at all. They hold so many seats for the Friends, supporters who pay for the privilege, that they've disenfranchised a lot of people, and after all this is funded at the rate of \u00a320m a year for the benefit of everyone. 'An audience can always be had for popular opera, well done, at a decent price. There are huge audiences out there. But the House's problem isn't just that it hasn't penetrated that audience; it doesn't want to penetrate that audience. Its coterie of supporters like to keep it exclusive, for Friends and corporate sponsors. I want an audience to come because it's there to see the show, not to be seen itself. And I don't think anyone's going to come in gardening gear, or smelly trainers, or whatever. 'There are all kinds of ways to get the place more efficient.

A few days later, Pilot Officer Stavert got on to the tail of a He. 113 near Dover and left it diving in flames. That summer, every small boy in Britain carried a silhouette of the He.113 about with him in his Aircraft Recognition booklet. But it was a Nazi propaganda invention, fed into the food-chain of British intelligence where it thrived.

Marshal Goering had ordered a few prototype Heinkel 112 fighters for the Luftwaffe, but in 1938 his advisers persuaded him that the main order for single-seat fighters should go to the Messerschmidt 109. Heinkel, cutting losses, sold the rejects to Franco's Spain and Japan, where they performed poorly.

About 141,000 divorces are granted in England and Wales each year, with around 12,000 in Scotland. On both sides of the border, courts compel the man to support his children until they have finished full-time education. Scottish courts calculate a 50-50 split between the couple's assets and compel men to support their ex-wives for three years after the settlement has been established, a recent change in the law which has made divorce cheaper for Scottish men, according to Cameron Fyfe, a senior partner in Glasgow's Ross Harper Solicitors who specialises in divorce and compensation cases. 'This survey flies in the face of assumptions but adheres absolutely to my anecdotal experience,' he said. 'Women have a far higher earning capacity nowadays, which means that settlements are less draining for men than they once were. 'And although both members of the failed marriage will be worse off immediately after the divorce, this new three-year limit means the strain on men's pockets is relatively short-lived.'",

      "body": "<p>The perfect cigar is about ritual as well as smoking. The business of getting the cigar out of the box, cutting the end off, lighting it and having the first puff of the day with a cup of coffee is integral. I think you enjoy a cigar much more if you're on your own. I do smoke when I'm having a meeting with people, but it's not the best time. Smoking in the greenhouse with a glass of Armagnac is one of my greatest pleasures.</p> <p>The perfect taste is a matter of opinion. My favourite cigar, Hoya de Monterrey, has a very robust flavour. It's rather like smelling a wonderful autumn bonfire. Everyone knows how thrilling that aroma is, and when you smoke a cigar there's that little bonfire burning just outside your mouth and the flavour of burning leaves in your mouth. It's incomparable.</p> <p>Just like the rest of life, it is often the packaging that is a very important part of your enjoyment of the cigar. If you buy a shirt in a very nice box, beautifully folded in tissue paper, it adds to the appreciation of that particular bit of clothing. The cigar boxes and the graphics associated with them are wonderful. The little band around a Cohiba, the national cigar of Cuba, is particularly attractive.

      "bodyText": "The perfect cigar is about ritual as well as smoking. The business of getting the cigar out of the box, cutting the end off, lighting it and having the first puff of the day with a cup of coffee is integral. I think you enjoy a cigar much more if you're on your own. I do smoke when I'm having a meeting with people, but it's not the best time. Smoking in the greenhouse with a glass of Armagnac is one of my greatest pleasures. The perfect taste is a matter of opinion. My favourite cigar, Hoya de Monterrey, has a very robust flavour. It's rather like smelling a wonderful autumn bonfire. Everyone knows how thrilling that aroma is, and when you smoke a cigar there's that little bonfire burning just outside your mouth and the flavour of burning leaves in your mouth. It's incomparable. Just like the rest of life, it is often the packaging that is a very important part of your enjoyment of the cigar. If you buy a shirt in a very nice box, beautifully folded in tissue paper, it adds to the appreciation of that particular bit of clothing. The cigar boxes and the graphics associated with them are wonderful. The little band around a Cohiba, the national cigar of Cuba, is particularly attractive. It's said that Castro designed it himself, but that's probably just clever spin. Cigars must be kept slightly damp - they taste better like that. If they're dry, the outer skin that holds the smoke in becomes brittle and comes off in shards. I keep mine in the cellar, which is just damp enough, but, of course, people should use a humidor.
