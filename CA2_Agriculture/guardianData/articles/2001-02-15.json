He fails.<br> <strong>3</strong> Free-kick to Roma after Babbel up-ends Candela in a dangerous position on the left. Candela takes, comes to nothing.<br> <strong>4</strong> Ziege lucky to avoid a card for a crunching tackle on Cafu. Westerveld forced down to his right by Nakata from distance.<br> <strong>6</strong> Tomassi finds Emerson in the middle of the park with a great ball before Candela is released on the left; Liverpool close him down.<br> <strong>7</strong> Nakata and Delvecchio combine well on the edge of the area but neither can get in a shot. Liverpool respond with a break and Owen gets to the edge of the Roma area before being muscled off the ball. Liverpool's first meaningful move upfield.<br> <strong>10</strong> Delvecchio released into the area with a fine crossfield pass by Nakata. Crosses, but no one meets it.<br> <strong>12</strong> Free-kick to Roma near the left-hand corner flag. Westerveld punches clear for Cafu to shoot wide for distance.<br> <strong>15</strong> Ziege and McAllister play a one-two on the left but Ziege is unable to pick up the return on the edge of the Roma area.<br> <strong>16</strong> Liverpool starting to knock the ball around the bit more after an early onslaught by Roma. Still yet to have a chance on goal.<br> <strong>17</strong> Cafu crunches into Owen and comes off worse. Struggles to shake off the knock.<br> <strong>19</strong> Fowler steals in behind the Roma defence and shoots wide of the right-hand upright.<br> <strong>21</strong> Delvecchio gets away on the left; Henchoz unlucky to be called for a foul when his challenge looked good. Free-kick comes to nothing.<br> <strong>23</strong> Roma corner on the right. Good defending by Liverpool after the corner is played short, but Houllier's men are have trouble getting out of their half.<br> <strong>25</strong> McAllister gets away to the by-line but is run out for a goal-kick with Owen and Fowler waiting in the middle. <br> <strong>28</strong> Liverpool work the ball around to the left of the Roma area, with Owen and McAllister both looking lively, but a poor ball from Barmby back in to Owen finally blows things.<br> <strong>29</strong> Liverpool free-kick, Ziege takes to the far side of the area, Roma clear.<br> <strong>30</strong> Hamann does well to burgle possession in midfield but is hacked down by Emerson after a run across the park. <br> <strong>31</strong> Liverpool free-kick from fully 35 yards out; Delvecchio almost puts into his own net with a glancing header behind.

Liverpool: 1-Sander Westerveld; 6-Markus Babbel, 23-Jamie Carragher, 12-Sami Hyppia, 2-Stephan Henchoz; 16-Dietmar Hamann, 21-Gary McAllister, 20-Nicky Barmby; 3-Christian Ziege; 10-Michael Owen, 9-Robbie Fowler. Referee: Markus Merk (Germany) 1 Barmby kicks off for a Liverpool side hoping to capitalise on the absence of Batistuta and Totti. 2 Emerson tries to get things going with a probing ball down the left flank. He fails. 3 Free-kick to Roma after Babbel up-ends Candela in a dangerous position on the left. Candela takes, comes to nothing. 4 Ziege lucky to avoid a card for a crunching tackle on Cafu. Westerveld forced down to his right by Nakata from distance. 6 Tomassi finds Emerson in the middle of the park with a great ball before Candela is released on the left; Liverpool close him down. 7 Nakata and Delvecchio combine well on the edge of the area but neither can get in a shot. Liverpool respond with a break and Owen gets to the edge of the Roma area before being muscled off the ball. Liverpool's first meaningful move upfield. 10 Delvecchio released into the area with a fine crossfield pass by Nakata. Crosses, but no one meets it. 12 Free-kick to Roma near the left-hand corner flag. Westerveld punches clear for Cafu to shoot wide for distance. 15 Ziege and McAllister play a one-two on the left but Ziege is unable to pick up the return on the edge of the Roma area. 16 Liverpool starting to knock the ball around the bit more after an early onslaught by Roma. Still yet to have a chance on goal. 17 Cafu crunches into Owen and comes off worse. Struggles to shake off the knock. 19 Fowler steals in behind the Roma defence and shoots wide of the right-hand upright. 21 Delvecchio gets away on the left; Henchoz unlucky to be called for a foul when his challenge looked good. Free-kick comes to nothing. 23 Roma corner on the right. Good defending by Liverpool after the corner is played short, but Houllier's men are have trouble getting out of their half. 25 McAllister gets away to the by-line but is run out for a goal-kick with Owen and Fowler waiting in the middle. 28 Liverpool work the ball around to the left of the Roma area, with Owen and McAllister both looking lively, but a poor ball from Barmby back in to Owen finally blows things. 29 Liverpool free-kick, Ziege takes to the far side of the area, Roma clear. 30 Hamann does well to burgle possession in midfield but is hacked down by Emerson after a run across the park. 31 Liverpool free-kick from fully 35 yards out; Delvecchio almost puts into his own net with a glancing header behind. Corner comes to nothing. 37 Babbel finds Fowler on the edge of the area, Roma clear and Ziege shoots from 20 yards. 38 Liverpool free-kick way out on the left; Ziege takes but it comes to nothing. 39 Candela wins a corner on the left after doing a little dance down by the flag. Zilch. 41 Not pretty at the minute - pretty scrappy in fact. 42 Delvecchio comes in beautifully on a great cross from Rinaldi on the right - and puts it fractionally over from less than 10 yards.

Liverpool's travelling support fill the void. 58 Scrappy again by Roma as Candela gives the ball away in midfield; Owen and Fowler offside so they cannot capitalise. 60 Corner to Roma; Westerveld claims.

Assun\u00e7ao tries to chip over the top but the ball goes for a goal-kick. 63 Good movement by Liverpool; Fowler plays it wide to the left wing and Barmby strikes first time from the return... over the bar. 65 Assun\u00e7ao forces a great save from Westerveld with a shot from the edge of the area.

      "bodyText": "Heat, the Emap-owned celebrity weekly tipped for closure early last year, has reported a staggering 138% increase in sales for the second half of 2000. The turnaround in Heat's fortunes comes as the whole celebrity magazine sector enjoys a boost in sales. Titles such as OK!, Hello! and Now are flourishing. Barry McIlheney, chief executive of Heat publisher Emap Elan, said: \"We're thrilled - I can't remember an increase of this scale.\" Mr McIlheney added the huge increase vindicated the more female-friendly content introduced last year by Emap. Stories such as All Saints' bitch-fights and Madonna's wedding have become the staple fare for the magazine. Heat's circulation is now 172,311 compared with 72,510 at the same period in 1999. Across the board, celebrity magazines enjoyed a circulation hike. Northern &amp; Shell's OK! is the market leader with a circulation of 586,176. This is an increase of 6% on the same period for the previous year but a 20% recovery from its sales dip to 455,162 for the last six months. OK!'s arch rival Hello! - which has a new editor-in-chief, former News of the World editor Phil Hall - is stable, with a circulation of 502,679. This amounts to an increase of 1.5% on Hello!'s December 1999 circulation of 495,349. Also flourishing is IPC Connect's weekly Now. It has boosted its circulation by 20% to 475,571 over the past year. The hike has resulted from the combination of price cutting and aggressive above-the-line marketing. Hello! publishing director Sally Cartwright said the market for celebrity magazines was \"extremely healthy\" at the moment. But Ms Cartwright noted an increasing volatility in the market, which she attributed to one-off exclusive issues resulting from deals with celebrities. \"When you look at an average figure for the period, it will have been affected those single big exclusives, like the Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones issue of OK!\" She noted that Hello!'s ABC figures for the second half of 1997 had been boosted to the tune of almost 70,000 by coverage of the death and funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. \"It has happened to us in the past and it will again,\" Ms Cartwright added.",

Best regards,<br> Ken McRae</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In May 1999, my husband and I flew to Juneau in Alaska and caught the public ferry back down to Prince Rupert on the coast.

We were pushed for time, otherwise we would have taken longer and spent more time in Alaska and BC. The ferry trip was beautiful but as the weather was very misty and drizzly we didn't see much. As we were going along the captain of the boat would announce when there were whales, dolphins or porpoises in view. We also saw bald eagles. When in Juneau, we encountered a mass invasion by visitors from a cruise boat. Seeing somewhere for just a couple of hours along with hoards of other people is not my idea of a good time. Also, the locals don't get as much out of the deal as you would think. Visitors eat on the boat and often leave their money there too so don't always even buy the assorted souvenirs on offer.

The driver was very knowledgeable and willing to share his experience. He pointed out brown bears and mountain goats en route and stopped the bus so we could watch. The Rocky Mountain rail journey does look fantastic from what I've seen on TV. Personally I would be tempted to take the rail journey and then try to pick up a ferry to see some of the Inside Passage. The accommodation won't be quite as plush as a cruise boat but it will be a heck of a lot cheaper, more flexible and you get more of a feel of what life is like in the region as the ferries are used extensively by local people. I'm sure the ferries do have cabins etc and you would be able to pick one up at various places along the coast, including near Vancouver (if that is where your rail journey ends). You could then add a few days return ferry journey to your rail experience, depending on how far you wanted to go. BC Ferries have an internet site which will give you the info you need. Alaska Marine Highways also have a useful site. Hope that helps. Have a great time! <br>Hannah Rayfield </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> A few years ago, my family and I took a trip to Canada for three weeks and had the most fantastic time. We flew to Toronto and stayed in a hotel downtown for two nights to do the Niagara falls trip and see the city. We then flew to Calgary where we picked up a camper van - not one of these old fashioned things, it had a bedroom and bathroom and a fitted kitchen (make sure the cupboard door are locked when you're going around corners!!). We then drove thought the Rockies to Vancouver. It was fantastic: the Canadians are so well equipped for this kind of travel, and depending upon what kind of mood you're in, you can stay in a 'wilderness site' in the middle of the forest where all the pitches have a barbecue and you can see the dusk fall with a nice cold beer and watch all the wildlife happening around you, or you can stay at a site with a swimming pool and amusements. </p> <p> We drove through Banff and Jasper, walked on the Columbian ice fields and around Lake Louise. The beauty of this kind of holiday (providing you can drive!) is that you can stay as long as you like in the places you enjoy, and there is no rush to stick to a rigid timetable or do what other people want you to do. When we arrived in Vancouver we took the ferry over to Vancouver island, which you have to see. The ferry ride is fantastic in itself, and the island is beautiful. An absolute must on the island is to go whale watching from the harbour.</p> <p>Liz France</p>",

An absolute must on the island is to go whale watching from the harbour. Liz France",

      "bodyText": "Esquire is still haemorrhaging readers following its decision to drop the soft porn image synonymous with the monthly men's magazine market. The National Magazine Company title has suffered another double-figure circulation drop. The latest Audit Bureau of Circulation figures for July to December 2000 show a 13% period-on-period decrease in circulation to 61,271. Esquire's circulation to the end of June 2000 was 70,435. The title is now 39% down year-on-year from its December 1999 figure of 100,482. But Esquire editor Peter Howarth said NatMags had expected the drop as the result of shedding those readers more interested in a high nipple count. Mr Howarth repositioned the title last year, replacing cover pictures of semi-naked women with close-ups of celebrities such as Johnny Depp. \"This second ABC since our repositioning does not compare like with like,\" he said. \"The magazine is now palpably different. \"We have changed our readership profile - the age and ABC1 profile has increased and we are left with people who buy the magazine regularly.\" He added that comparing the ABC figure period-on-period shows readership is up 37% and that newsstand sales are solid. \"We took a hit and shed a whole load of younger, more downmarket readers when we went from naked Wonderbra models to Johnny Depp and we have not recovered from it,\" Mr Howarth said. \"The first year after the repositioning was a year of grief and pain, this year we'll see consolidation and next year we'll see growth. \"By the middle of this year, we'll be back up to a 70,000 circulation.\" Mr Howarth wants to attract affluent, loyal 30-year-old readers, \"and the more upmarket you go, the fewer readers there are\". The editor predicts the men's 30-something market is about to boom and believes Esquire will be held up as the benchmark. He pointed out that James Brown's I Feel Good, Felix Dennis' Dennis Publishing, Ampersand and Subject are now targeting 30-something men. Mr Howarth claimed the success story for Esquire was not its circulation figures but its advertising revenue. It is making more money on a magazine that sells far fewer copies, he said. Luxury brands that do not want to be associated with bikini-clad weathergirls are flocking back to a classier product, according to Mr Howarth. Prada has increased its investment in Esquire three-fold and Armani four-fold. Mediacom TMB's press director Steve Goodman agreed. \"Esquire has been true to its initial word, has stuck with the new concept and the mag still looks great,\" said Mr Goodman. \"It is not losing the readers our advertisers are interested in.\" But another media buyer was more sceptical. \"Esquire is floundering,\" he said. \"It reassessed its position in the market and lost circulation, but it was then saying it had settled it down,\" he added. \"But another double-figure drop means even its core readers aren't happy.\"",

Without major action, the charity forecast profits would be just \u00a33.7m in 2003-04. It hopes that cutting the jobs of middle managers involved in supporting shops and giving shop managers more autonomy will help reverse the downturn. Like others, Oxfam has been effected by the fierce competition in mid- and down-market clothes retailing, which has clobbered brands like Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p>At Scope, which has also been badly hit in the last two years, trading managers are pinning their hopes on a package of new initiatives designed to raise the shops' profile and attract new kinds of customers. Scope's shops' profits halved to \u00a32.6m in 1999-2000. This was due to factors such as fierce competition among clothing retailers, problems in recruiting staff and higher shop rents. The charity closed 22 shops last year, leaving it with about 300, and has made changes such as ensuring all its shops can accept debit and credit cards. It has also launched promotions, such as Scope for Sound, which focuses on CDs and records and has attracted support from Chris Tarrant and local DJs, many of whom have donated CDs. </p> <p>\"That kind of campaign helps us to attract young people interested in music, who may not have been in our shops before,\" says spokeswoman Marcella McEvoy. The charity has also experimented with specialist sections in some shops. \"For example, we've introduced book sections in some shops, and that's helped raise sales,\" she says. </p> <p>Scope is also looking at moving stock around the country to create themed stores in certain areas, depending on the local customer profile. \"We're looking at setting up shops dedicated to, say, wedding wear or books,\" says McEvoy. </p> <p>At Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which has 430 shops, the record is more positive, according to southern region head of retail Lucy Machin: \"We seem to have bucked the trend, with 1999-2000 profits up 18% to \u00a37.1m.\" </p> <p>She notes that the charity closed 26 loss-making shops last year. She attributes the strong financial performance in large part to improved management processes. \"For example, we've done a lot of work on improving the speed that we get donated goods to shops, which cuts out stock control costs a lot.\" The charity also ensures its local pricing is competitive, depending on the locality of the shop, says Machin. </p> <p>Early indicators suggest that Christmas sales in charity shops were relatively strong and many believe a corner has been turned. Scope's Marcella McEvoy says sales and profit appear to have bounced back in recent months, while ICRF's Lucy Machin says Christmas sales, particularly of new goods, were strong. </p> <p>Lekha Klouda, executive secretary at the Association of Charity Shops, says: \"Times have been tough over the past year but things seem to be looking less bleak now.\" But charities will have to adapt to a significantly tougher trading climate, she adds: \"There's little likelihood of a return to the golden age of the mid-1990s when sales growth seemed never ending.\"</p>",

The charity has also experimented with specialist sections in some shops. \"For example, we've introduced book sections in some shops, and that's helped raise sales,\" she says. Scope is also looking at moving stock around the country to create themed stores in certain areas, depending on the local customer profile. \"We're looking at setting up shops dedicated to, say, wedding wear or books,\" says McEvoy. At Imperial Cancer Research Fund, which has 430 shops, the record is more positive, according to southern region head of retail Lucy Machin: \"We seem to have bucked the trend, with 1999-2000 profits up 18% to \u00a37.1m.\" She notes that the charity closed 26 loss-making shops last year. She attributes the strong financial performance in large part to improved management processes. \"For example, we've done a lot of work on improving the speed that we get donated goods to shops, which cuts out stock control costs a lot.\" The charity also ensures its local pricing is competitive, depending on the locality of the shop, says Machin. Early indicators suggest that Christmas sales in charity shops were relatively strong and many believe a corner has been turned. Scope's Marcella McEvoy says sales and profit appear to have bounced back in recent months, while ICRF's Lucy Machin says Christmas sales, particularly of new goods, were strong. Lekha Klouda, executive secretary at the Association of Charity Shops, says: \"Times have been tough over the past year but things seem to be looking less bleak now.\" But charities will have to adapt to a significantly tougher trading climate, she adds: \"There's little likelihood of a return to the golden age of the mid-1990s when sales growth seemed never ending.\"",

Industrial action would hit all areas of the BBC, apart from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide and the corporation's orchestras.

In addition, a cap of \u00a355 per night has been placed on hotel claims. \"We think the BBC has been unreasonable with its decision on allowances, which are inconsistent with industry standards,\" said a spokesman for Bectu. \"Workers can get a hot meal after 7.30pm at ITV but BBC workers have to work 12 long hours before they can get a meal.\" He added BBC managers authorised and set their own levels of allowance, whereas a cap had been placed on staff expenses. \"It's basically one rule for management and one rule for those that make the programmes.\" A BBC spokesman responded by saying the change in policy was about making sure the corporation was \"tightening up wherever possible, in a climate of making savings wherever we can, to spend more om priority programming\".

      "body": "<p>It is the morning of March 14 and in Downing Street Tony Blair is putting on his best suit in readiness for the short drive to Buckingham Palace. With the cameras watching his every move, the prime minister is off to inform the Queen that he wants to call an election. </p> <p>The moment when the prime minister is planning to launch his re-election campaign is still a closely guarded secret. But March 14 could be as good a day as any. Why? Because on current trends that will be the day when the office for national statistics announces that in February unemployment fell below the million mark for the first time since December 1975. </p> <p>After nigh on nine years of steady economic growth, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit fell 25,500 last month to 1,004,800, according to official figures released yesterday. Over the past six months it has been declining by 10,800 a month on average, and if February matches that performance the total will be in six figures. </p> <p>For a Labour government seeking re-election this looks like an opportunity too good to miss. It has all the ingredients: a sign that economic policies are delivering, the prospect of a return to the full employment era of the 50s and 60s, and the chance to expunge for once and for all memories of the taunts hurled by Mrs Thatcher in 1979. The abiding image of the election that ushered in 18 years of Conservative rule was the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi poster depicting a dole queue with the slogan \"Labour isn't working\". </p> <p><strong> Woven into the fabric</strong><br> </p> <p> David Blunkett said yesterday's data was \"a major milestone, shedding the legacy of mass unemployment\". While the employment secretary was guilty of a little hyperbole, there is no doubting the significance of the million mark. For more than 20 years, mass unemployment has been woven into the fabric of politics. It was Jim Callaghan who sounded the death-knell for the era of full employment with his speech to the Labour party conference in 1976, and within five years jobless levels were back to totals not seen since the depression of the 1930s. Yosser Hughes in Boys from the Blackstuff summed up the mood of despair in the 1980s. A decade later, the steel workers-turned-strippers in the Full Monty showed the problem had not gone away. </p> <p>Now it seems mass unemployment may be a thing of the past. Mr Blair will be able to boast that the government is leaving office with the jobless total lower than when it was elected, something that could not be said of either the 1964-70 or 1974-79 administrations. Unsurprisingly, he and his cabinet colleagues will want to make as much political capital as they can out of the encouraging trend, even though they are entitled to only part of the credit. </p> <p>Labour might like to give the impression that unemployment started to fall on May 1 1997, the day Mr Blair was elected, but the reality is different. Unemployment has been falling since the immediate aftermath of Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and had dropped from 2.96m to 1.66m by the time the Conservatives were ousted. </p> <p>The precise reason for the improvement is hotly debated. Some argue that credit should go to the Conservatives for the supply-side measures of the 1980s, which made the labour market more flexible. However, the big change in the 1990s has been a more benign global economic environment in which the ebbing away of inflationary pressure following the twin oil shocks of the 1970s has made life easier for policymakers. Politicians and central bankers have seized the opportunity and made few blunders in the conduct of macroeconomic policy. The demand for jobs rose under Conservative chancellor Kenneth Clarke and continued to grow under Gordon Brown, at least until recent months when it has flattened out. </p> <p>Labour's big idea in 1997 was the New Deal, a \u00a35.2bn scheme to take the long-term unemployed out of the dole queue and re-equip them for the world of work. While there is general agreement that the New Deal is on a different plane from all previous make-work schemes, researchers who have tried to disentangle its effects on unemployment have found it of a secondary importance to the general health of the economy. In late 1999, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said that, of the 145,000 18- to 24-year-olds who had found work through the New Deal, only 30,000 would still have been unemployed without it. </p> <p>While Labour's commitment to using innovative solutions to long-term unemployment has been commendable, the same cannot be said of its selective use of data for political ends. The government's new-found enthusiasm for the claimant count measure of unemployment represents opportunism of the highest order. </p> <p>In opposition, Mr Blair and his colleagues fiercely criticised the way the Tories massaged down the claimant count measure of unemployment by repeatedly changing the definition of joblessness to exclude trainees, the long-term sick, early retirees and other segments of the population. After the 30 changes to the count, Labour said it would rely on the more reliable International Labour Organisation definition of unemployment, which includes all those available and looking for work, not just those on benefits. Indeed, in February 1998 the government changed presentation of the monthly unemployment figures to downgrade the claimant and give more emphasis to the ILO method of calculation. But, with an election in the offing, the claimant count makes better headlines. It is not just that the ILO measure is higher, it is a lot higher: 1,560,000 at the latest count. This figure was absent from the statement issued by Mr Blunkett yesterday. According to experts, even the ILO definition does not give a true picture of the labour market. </p> <p>Paul Bivand, senior research fellow at the Unemployment Unit, which lobbies on behalf of the jobless, said: \"I think the ILO definition... excludes large numbers of people for one reason or another. For example, people with family responsibilities who nevertheless want to work, people who have given up hope of finding work, and people who are sick and disabled.\" </p> <p><strong> Industrial regions</strong><br> </p> <p> Professor Stephen Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam University said: \"There is no doubt that the true level of unemployment since 1997 has fallen. The last time I did a comprehensive analysis to measure the real level in January 1997 it was 3.9m. Now I suspect the real level is somewhat below 3m. It is a significant improvement but it is perhaps not as big as we would wish to see. There is still a huge problem which is not picked up by the official figures.\" </p> <p>There was a tendency of politicians and journalists based in London to ignore the pockets of mass unemployment in the industrial regions ravaged by the deep recessions of the 1980s and early 1990s. Yesterday's figures showed manufacturing has shed 106,000 jobs in the past year, with textiles, leather and transport equipment bearing the brunt. </p> <p>One indication of the hidden pool of joblessness is the quadrupling of people classified as long-term sick, from 500,000 at the beginning of the 80s to just under 2m now. \"You can't explain that by a deterioration in health\", Prof Fothergill said. \"It is clearly linked to what is going on in the labour market.\" </p> <p>For all the caveats, Labour has a good tale to tell the electorate. Whatever the real level of unemployment, it is heading in the right direction and in some of the more prosperous parts of the country the goal of full employment has already been achieved. To his credit, Mr Blunkett admitted yesterday that \"a million people claiming benefits and out of work is still too many\". With unemployment still blighting many poor regions, such realism is to be welcomed. In those parts of the country where the Full Monty is still a reality, there is a lot of work to do. </p> <p><strong>The things they say</strong></p> <p>\"My dispute with the statistics is that they are not an accurate measure of the level of unemployment, but that the government continues to represent them as such ... It appears that every effort is being made to discredit my attempts to take politics out of statistics.\" </p> <p><strong> John Prescott, March 1994</strong> </p> <p>\"Public concern over the validity of unemployment statistics will not go away until the next government takes steps to improve their basis.\" </p> <p><strong> Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Statistical Society, April 1997 </strong></p> <p>In February 1998, Labour rejected a switch from the flawed claimant count to a full monthly survey of unemployment as too expensive. It said it would introduce a monthly measure of unemployment based on the existing quarterly Labour Force Survey. </p> <p>\"It is hoped the move will restore public confidence in figures that had become widely discredited.\" </p> <p><strong> Andrew Smith, employment minister February 1998</strong></p>",

It has all the ingredients: a sign that economic policies are delivering, the prospect of a return to the full employment era of the 50s and 60s, and the chance to expunge for once and for all memories of the taunts hurled by Mrs Thatcher in 1979. The abiding image of the election that ushered in 18 years of Conservative rule was the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi poster depicting a dole queue with the slogan \"Labour isn't working\". Woven into the fabric David Blunkett said yesterday's data was \"a major milestone, shedding the legacy of mass unemployment\". While the employment secretary was guilty of a little hyperbole, there is no doubting the significance of the million mark. For more than 20 years, mass unemployment has been woven into the fabric of politics. It was Jim Callaghan who sounded the death-knell for the era of full employment with his speech to the Labour party conference in 1976, and within five years jobless levels were back to totals not seen since the depression of the 1930s. Yosser Hughes in Boys from the Blackstuff summed up the mood of despair in the 1980s. A decade later, the steel workers-turned-strippers in the Full Monty showed the problem had not gone away. Now it seems mass unemployment may be a thing of the past. Mr Blair will be able to boast that the government is leaving office with the jobless total lower than when it was elected, something that could not be said of either the 1964-70 or 1974-79 administrations. Unsurprisingly, he and his cabinet colleagues will want to make as much political capital as they can out of the encouraging trend, even though they are entitled to only part of the credit. Labour might like to give the impression that unemployment started to fall on May 1 1997, the day Mr Blair was elected, but the reality is different. Unemployment has been falling since the immediate aftermath of Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 and had dropped from 2.96m to 1.66m by the time the Conservatives were ousted. The precise reason for the improvement is hotly debated. Some argue that credit should go to the Conservatives for the supply-side measures of the 1980s, which made the labour market more flexible. However, the big change in the 1990s has been a more benign global economic environment in which the ebbing away of inflationary pressure following the twin oil shocks of the 1970s has made life easier for policymakers. Politicians and central bankers have seized the opportunity and made few blunders in the conduct of macroeconomic policy. The demand for jobs rose under Conservative chancellor Kenneth Clarke and continued to grow under Gordon Brown, at least until recent months when it has flattened out. Labour's big idea in 1997 was the New Deal, a \u00a35.2bn scheme to take the long-term unemployed out of the dole queue and re-equip them for the world of work. While there is general agreement that the New Deal is on a different plane from all previous make-work schemes, researchers who have tried to disentangle its effects on unemployment have found it of a secondary importance to the general health of the economy. In late 1999, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said that, of the 145,000 18- to 24-year-olds who had found work through the New Deal, only 30,000 would still have been unemployed without it. While Labour's commitment to using innovative solutions to long-term unemployment has been commendable, the same cannot be said of its selective use of data for political ends. The government's new-found enthusiasm for the claimant count measure of unemployment represents opportunism of the highest order. In opposition, Mr Blair and his colleagues fiercely criticised the way the Tories massaged down the claimant count measure of unemployment by repeatedly changing the definition of joblessness to exclude trainees, the long-term sick, early retirees and other segments of the population. After the 30 changes to the count, Labour said it would rely on the more reliable International Labour Organisation definition of unemployment, which includes all those available and looking for work, not just those on benefits. Indeed, in February 1998 the government changed presentation of the monthly unemployment figures to downgrade the claimant and give more emphasis to the ILO method of calculation. But, with an election in the offing, the claimant count makes better headlines. It is not just that the ILO measure is higher, it is a lot higher: 1,560,000 at the latest count. This figure was absent from the statement issued by Mr Blunkett yesterday. According to experts, even the ILO definition does not give a true picture of the labour market. Paul Bivand, senior research fellow at the Unemployment Unit, which lobbies on behalf of the jobless, said: \"I think the ILO definition... excludes large numbers of people for one reason or another. For example, people with family responsibilities who nevertheless want to work, people who have given up hope of finding work, and people who are sick and disabled.\" Industrial regions Professor Stephen Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam University said: \"There is no doubt that the true level of unemployment since 1997 has fallen. The last time I did a comprehensive analysis to measure the real level in January 1997 it was 3.9m. Now I suspect the real level is somewhat below 3m. It is a significant improvement but it is perhaps not as big as we would wish to see. There is still a huge problem which is not picked up by the official figures.\" There was a tendency of politicians and journalists based in London to ignore the pockets of mass unemployment in the industrial regions ravaged by the deep recessions of the 1980s and early 1990s. Yesterday's figures showed manufacturing has shed 106,000 jobs in the past year, with textiles, leather and transport equipment bearing the brunt. One indication of the hidden pool of joblessness is the quadrupling of people classified as long-term sick, from 500,000 at the beginning of the 80s to just under 2m now. \"You can't explain that by a deterioration in health\", Prof Fothergill said. \"It is clearly linked to what is going on in the labour market.\" For all the caveats, Labour has a good tale to tell the electorate. Whatever the real level of unemployment, it is heading in the right direction and in some of the more prosperous parts of the country the goal of full employment has already been achieved. To his credit, Mr Blunkett admitted yesterday that \"a million people claiming benefits and out of work is still too many\". With unemployment still blighting many poor regions, such realism is to be welcomed. In those parts of the country where the Full Monty is still a reality, there is a lot of work to do. The things they say \"My dispute with the statistics is that they are not an accurate measure of the level of unemployment, but that the government continues to represent them as such ... It appears that every effort is being made to discredit my attempts to take politics out of statistics.\" John Prescott, March 1994 \"Public concern over the validity of unemployment statistics will not go away until the next government takes steps to improve their basis.\" Adrian Smith, president of the Royal Statistical Society, April 1997 In February 1998, Labour rejected a switch from the flawed claimant count to a full monthly survey of unemployment as too expensive. It said it would introduce a monthly measure of unemployment based on the existing quarterly Labour Force Survey. \"It is hoped the move will restore public confidence in figures that had become widely discredited.\" Andrew Smith, employment minister February 1998",

Voters were given two other options: a 2% increase on the \u00a3351m budget, which would still have meant cuts of \u00a32.2m and a 6% rise, which could have brought extra spending of \u00a32.2m.</p> <p>Labour councillors appeared cautiously confident of persuading voters to opt for a modest increase, which would have amounted to around \u00a375 on the average band D property which pays \u00a31,000 annually.

He added: \"If they accept the decision of the council taxpayers and in the process abdicate their responsibility for education in the city, then there will be severely damaged schools throughout Bristol, and they deserve to be declared a failing local education authority with all the consequences - including privatisation - that will inevitably follow.\" The referendum attracted a 40 % turnout, 10% higher than in local elections. Voters were given two other options: a 2% increase on the \u00a3351m budget, which would still have meant cuts of \u00a32.2m and a 6% rise, which could have brought extra spending of \u00a32.2m. Labour councillors appeared cautiously confident of persuading voters to opt for a modest increase, which would have amounted to around \u00a375 on the average band D property which pays \u00a31,000 annually. Council tax in the city has been frozen for two years. Council leader George Micklewright last night tried to put a brave face on what he called a \"worthwhile exercise in local democracy\". But he conceded: \"This was not the result we hoped for and we made it clear what the consequences of no increase would be, with some graphic illustrations. No one could say they did not have enough information.\" He could not say whether any teachers would be sacked because under local school management individual schools would have to make decisions. \"But it looks like some teaching posts will go.\" Ministers had been keenly awaiting the Bristol result because they had been hailing the referendum as a ground-breaking exercise in local democracy - the first poll of its kind in a large city. In a smaller referendum in Milton Keynes two years ago, voters opted for a 10% increase, almost four times the rate of inflation, after being presented with three other options - including the prospect of big cuts in education if they went for a smaller increase.",

The move comes after senate and house committees launched similar probes of the Rich pardon, one of 141 granted by Mr Clinton on his final day in office. Ms White, who was appointed to her post by Clinton in 1993, has said the pardon was granted without consultation with her office, which indicted Mr Rich in 1983.

Lars von Trier's middlebrow dumbfest Dancer in the Dark has been comprehensively snubbed in the Academy award nominations, with the exception - and probably the deserved exception - of a nomination for Bjork's \"I've Seen It All\" number in the best original song category. The Academy has given the bum's rush to Von Trier's shallow, self-important arthouse/ commercial shocker, unimpressed by its urgent message that capital punishment for innocent blind mothers is unacceptable. Maybe the Oscars are middlebrow. But at least they're honest middlebrow. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the list contains no great surprises and, in contrast to last year's classy, literate, left-field contenders, such as American Beauty, Blair Witch and Being John Malkovich, it's pretty MOR. The theme of this year's nominations seems to be one big showdown: Ridley Scott's Roman epic Gladiator versus Ang Lee's magic-realist wire-fu fable, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Russell Crowe's pecs are, as it were, flexing in sweaty combat with the elfin, elegant forms of Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh, the most compelling exponents of girl power in the cinema. </p> <p>Having said that, Yeoh and Zhang are not in contention in the performance categories. Crouching Tiger has nominations in 10 sections - most remarkably best picture (rare for a subtitled movie) - while Gladiator has 12. An equal Gladiator/Tiger split is unlikely; in all probability, only one of the two will carry off the big bag of most of the prizes. </p> <p>Most importantly, Gladiator has two of the sexy performance nominations - for Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix - with Crowe a virtual shoo-in for best actor. It will be the biggest upset of the night if he doesn't get it, despite the strong competition, though there is always a chance that the wet-blanket turn from Tom Hanks in the dire Cast Away will seduce the Academy. Gladiator is such a powerful, substantial picture, and contains a virile, subliminal element of industry ancestor-worship, in that it is a triumphant revival of the Roman epic, one of the best-loved genres of the Hollywood golden age. </p> <p>That said, my preference is for Crouching Tiger, a truly remarkable film, managing to combine gentleness, drama, decorum and understated sexiness. It could be that Ang Lee's Taiwanese background will helpfully militate against any residual anti-Chinese prejudice among older Academicians, and the Academy may respond to the film as a revival of the spirit of the western. </p> <p>But I fear that Crouching Tiger will lose out to Gladiator, with the possible exception of a best director award for Lee (and of course the best foreign film prize). In the final analysis, it is a subtitled film and will be seen as irremediably alien, however well it does at the box office, and the powers that be may feel that nominations mark the limit of their generosity. </p> <p>Things do not look great on the British front. Billy Elliot, despite the hype and full-page ads, has only two nominations - Stephen Daldry for best director and Julie Walters for best supporting actress - and both are, realistically, long shots in their respective categories. There is a strong possibility that the Billy posse will climb back into their limos sorely disappointed. </p> <p>Elsewhere, it is now clear that Croupier, the Cinderella of British cinema success, shall not go to the ball. Judi Dench is in with a chance for a supporting award for Chocolat. But British hopes reside chiefly with Ridley Scott - a naturalised Hollywood player who is referred to as \"British-born\" rather than \"British\" - and the formidable Albert Finney, who plays the growling, spluttering American lawyer in Erin Brockovich. </p> <p>In the director's chair, Steven Soderbergh, for years considered a tragic hasbeen, has an embarrassment of riches with nominations for two films: the middling Erin Brockovich, and the powerful Traffic, for which Benicio Del Toro must surely take the best supporting actor prize. Soderbergh might well snatch the award from Lee and Scott. </p> <p>For best actress, I very much hope that Ellen Burstyn will get it for her outstanding performance in Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream; but there is every sign that Julia Roberts will get it for her overrated performance as Erin Brockovich. As for best supporting actress, I have a horrible feeling that the young princess of \u00fcber-hype, Kate Hudson (Almost Famous), will win the Gwyneth Paltrow award for most lachrymose speech, the waterworks kicking off at the first mention of her mum, Goldie Hawn. </p> <p>Biggest regrets? I am sorry that James Gray will receive nothing for his excellent labour-union drama The Yards, and more disappointed still that Terence Davies's brilliant Edith Wharton adaptation The House of Mirth has been slighted - although Laura Linney, so good in that film, has a nod for being in You Can Count on Me. </p> <p>On the whole, Oscar night, I predict, will belong to Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, triumphantly trundling through LA in their stretch chariot, with lowly ranking studio suits hired to murmur in their ear: \"You are but mortal.\"</p>",

Gladiator is such a powerful, substantial picture, and contains a virile, subliminal element of industry ancestor-worship, in that it is a triumphant revival of the Roman epic, one of the best-loved genres of the Hollywood golden age. That said, my preference is for Crouching Tiger, a truly remarkable film, managing to combine gentleness, drama, decorum and understated sexiness. It could be that Ang Lee's Taiwanese background will helpfully militate against any residual anti-Chinese prejudice among older Academicians, and the Academy may respond to the film as a revival of the spirit of the western. But I fear that Crouching Tiger will lose out to Gladiator, with the possible exception of a best director award for Lee (and of course the best foreign film prize). In the final analysis, it is a subtitled film and will be seen as irremediably alien, however well it does at the box office, and the powers that be may feel that nominations mark the limit of their generosity. Things do not look great on the British front. Billy Elliot, despite the hype and full-page ads, has only two nominations - Stephen Daldry for best director and Julie Walters for best supporting actress - and both are, realistically, long shots in their respective categories. There is a strong possibility that the Billy posse will climb back into their limos sorely disappointed. Elsewhere, it is now clear that Croupier, the Cinderella of British cinema success, shall not go to the ball. Judi Dench is in with a chance for a supporting award for Chocolat. But British hopes reside chiefly with Ridley Scott - a naturalised Hollywood player who is referred to as \"British-born\" rather than \"British\" - and the formidable Albert Finney, who plays the growling, spluttering American lawyer in Erin Brockovich. In the director's chair, Steven Soderbergh, for years considered a tragic hasbeen, has an embarrassment of riches with nominations for two films: the middling Erin Brockovich, and the powerful Traffic, for which Benicio Del Toro must surely take the best supporting actor prize. Soderbergh might well snatch the award from Lee and Scott. For best actress, I very much hope that Ellen Burstyn will get it for her outstanding performance in Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream; but there is every sign that Julia Roberts will get it for her overrated performance as Erin Brockovich. As for best supporting actress, I have a horrible feeling that the young princess of \u00fcber-hype, Kate Hudson (Almost Famous), will win the Gwyneth Paltrow award for most lachrymose speech, the waterworks kicking off at the first mention of her mum, Goldie Hawn. Biggest regrets? I am sorry that James Gray will receive nothing for his excellent labour-union drama The Yards, and more disappointed still that Terence Davies's brilliant Edith Wharton adaptation The House of Mirth has been slighted - although Laura Linney, so good in that film, has a nod for being in You Can Count on Me. On the whole, Oscar night, I predict, will belong to Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott, triumphantly trundling through LA in their stretch chariot, with lowly ranking studio suits hired to murmur in their ear: \"You are but mortal.\"",

Home secretary Jack Straw said that the system, which was designed to save more than \u00a3100m, would not become fully operational. The project should have been completed by 1998, it was said. Mr Straw announced the decision in a written parliamentary answer last week, which was raised in today's issue of Computer Weekly magazine. German company Siemens Business Services signed a contract in 1996 to set up the system to deal with asylum applications to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), the magazine said. The contract would run until 2003 and, while Siemens would continue to work on improving the existing computer network, the full scheme would not be completed, it was said. In his written answer Mr Straw said: \"IND has agreed with Siemens that they should stand down the resources they are using to develop the full casework application. \"At present there is no change to the current contract.\" Related articles 15.02.2001: Past government IT mess-ups 15.02.2001: Government computer systems failures How to claim asylum An A-Z of asylum seekers The main parties' positions on asylum seekers 06.02.2001: Straw wants to toughen asylum rules 04.02.2001: Tony Blair and Italian counterpart Guiliano Amato write for the Observer 06.02.2001: Asylum seekers to be 'sent back' 05.02.2001: Grim war on human traffickers 28.01.2001: Bosnia's corrupt elite grow fat on human cargo smuggled to West 28.01.2001: People trade makes Bosnia rich Interactive guide Seeking asylum: who, where and why?

Mr Davies said the final decision would now be left in the hands of the panel of five school governors. \"The governors will now hear the case of both sides at the hearing to be held at the school.\" He said it was up to the governors to decide whether any disciplinary action should be taken against Dr Aldersley and he was unable to make any further comment.",

      "body": "<p>It all started with a bit of harmless T-shirt sniffing. A group of women was asked to whiff T-shirts that had been worn by a group of unknown - and unwashed - men. All they had to do was say which shirts smelled best. The experiment, run by Claus Wedekind, a young Swiss scientist then at the University of Bern, was designed to find out if humans, like mice, use body odour to identify genetically appropriate mates. But it revealed something more worrying. </p> <p>As Wedekind predicted, most female volunteers had equivalent preferences to their rodent counterparts. Numerous studies in mice have shown that, given the choice, they sniff out mates with genes for immunity that differ from their own, and that this seems to increase their chances of producing healthy offspring. But among the volunteers there was a startling exception to this trend. Women on the contraceptive pill showed the reverse preference. Instead of being attracted to the scent of dissimilar men, they chose men whose genes for immunity were closest to their own. </p> <p>If humans are using smell to find a good partner for reproduction, and the pill is turning things upside down, then there could be serious consequences. By tricking users into falling for the wrong guy, the pill could make it more difficult for them to have children long after they stop taking it - by reducing their fertility, for example. </p> <p>It's a contentious idea. For a start, not everyone agrees that the human brain can register such smells, let alone that they might influence our behaviour. But if they do, then does the pill interfere with this form of sexual chemistry? \"It's a reasonable question,\" says Wayne Potts, a biologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who specialises in mate choice. His colleague, Dustin Penn, goes further: \"It wouldn't surprise me if sabotaging our reproductive machinery would lead to faulty mate choice.\" </p> <p>The genes at the centre of the debate are a large cluster called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. Each person has a unique combination of MHC genes that encode various components of their immune system. The idea is that the more varied an individual's MHC, the more robust their immunity. And if your parents have widely varying MHC genes, your own are more likely to be diverse. Parental differences may even increase the chances of your being born in the first place. </p> <p>If olfactory cues about MHC genes are so important, why do women taking the pill seem to respond so differently from other women? \"My guess is that the pill simulates pregnancy and that maybe during pregnancy, odour preferences change,\" says Wedekind. The theory is that during pregnancy, a female is attracted to the smell of her own relatives, who have similar MHCs to her own. After all, family members have the greatest interest in seeing her offspring survive. Pregnant women - and women whose bodies are tricked into thinking they're pregnant - might have the same tendency, says Wedekind. </p> <p>To date, almost all the work on MHC differences, mate choice and their effects on offspring viability has been done on rodents. But geneticist Carole Ober from the University of Chicago has come up with a cunning way to explore some of the same questions in humans. For more than a decade, she has been studying a North American religious community known as the Hutterites. Following Wedekind's revelations about the women's preference for certain odours in an artificial laboratory setting, Ober aimed to get information about real partnerships. </p> <p>In many ways, Hutterites are the perfect study group for \"natural\" mate choice among humans. They are a socially isolated group who work on communal farms, marry within their own community, and can trace their roots back to a handful of European ancestors in the 16th century. Single men and women visit neighbouring Hutterite colonies, and often end up working or celebrating special occasions alongside potential spouses.

      "bodyText": "It all started with a bit of harmless T-shirt sniffing. A group of women was asked to whiff T-shirts that had been worn by a group of unknown - and unwashed - men. All they had to do was say which shirts smelled best. The experiment, run by Claus Wedekind, a young Swiss scientist then at the University of Bern, was designed to find out if humans, like mice, use body odour to identify genetically appropriate mates. But it revealed something more worrying. As Wedekind predicted, most female volunteers had equivalent preferences to their rodent counterparts. Numerous studies in mice have shown that, given the choice, they sniff out mates with genes for immunity that differ from their own, and that this seems to increase their chances of producing healthy offspring. But among the volunteers there was a startling exception to this trend. Women on the contraceptive pill showed the reverse preference. Instead of being attracted to the scent of dissimilar men, they chose men whose genes for immunity were closest to their own. If humans are using smell to find a good partner for reproduction, and the pill is turning things upside down, then there could be serious consequences. By tricking users into falling for the wrong guy, the pill could make it more difficult for them to have children long after they stop taking it - by reducing their fertility, for example. It's a contentious idea. For a start, not everyone agrees that the human brain can register such smells, let alone that they might influence our behaviour. But if they do, then does the pill interfere with this form of sexual chemistry? \"It's a reasonable question,\" says Wayne Potts, a biologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who specialises in mate choice. His colleague, Dustin Penn, goes further: \"It wouldn't surprise me if sabotaging our reproductive machinery would lead to faulty mate choice.\" The genes at the centre of the debate are a large cluster called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. Each person has a unique combination of MHC genes that encode various components of their immune system. The idea is that the more varied an individual's MHC, the more robust their immunity. And if your parents have widely varying MHC genes, your own are more likely to be diverse. Parental differences may even increase the chances of your being born in the first place. If olfactory cues about MHC genes are so important, why do women taking the pill seem to respond so differently from other women? \"My guess is that the pill simulates pregnancy and that maybe during pregnancy, odour preferences change,\" says Wedekind. The theory is that during pregnancy, a female is attracted to the smell of her own relatives, who have similar MHCs to her own. After all, family members have the greatest interest in seeing her offspring survive. Pregnant women - and women whose bodies are tricked into thinking they're pregnant - might have the same tendency, says Wedekind. To date, almost all the work on MHC differences, mate choice and their effects on offspring viability has been done on rodents. But geneticist Carole Ober from the University of Chicago has come up with a cunning way to explore some of the same questions in humans. For more than a decade, she has been studying a North American religious community known as the Hutterites. Following Wedekind's revelations about the women's preference for certain odours in an artificial laboratory setting, Ober aimed to get information about real partnerships. In many ways, Hutterites are the perfect study group for \"natural\" mate choice among humans. They are a socially isolated group who work on communal farms, marry within their own community, and can trace their roots back to a handful of European ancestors in the 16th century. Single men and women visit neighbouring Hutterite colonies, and often end up working or celebrating special occasions alongside potential spouses. They don't use perfumes or deodorants. \"They are absolutely maximising the importance of MHC,\" says Ober. They marry once - divorce is strictly prohibited - and, claims Ober, they marry for love. Once paired off, they place a high value on big families, and seldom use contraception. So do Hutterites tend to marry people who have dissimilar MHCs? To answer this question, Ober and her colleagues studied 411 couples drawn from 31 Hutterite colonies. Despite the lack of genetic variation within this isolated population, only 44 of the couples matched for certain kinds of MHC. If mate selection were random the probability of that would have been only about 5%. Ober's group concludes that genes in this region of DNA may indeed influence mate choice in humans.

      "bodyText": "Culture secretary Chris Smith has intervened in a court case that could prevent the BBC and ITV from obtaining broadcasting rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. Mr Smith has petitioned the House of Lords to let his department give evidence in an appeal hearing on a case between the Independent Television Commission and UK-based TVDanmark. The government is stepping up its campaign to keep the World Cup on terrestrial TV. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of MPs also joined the fight today. They filed a House of Commons early day motion registering their concern at the prospect of the BBC and ITV losing World Cup rights. German media company Kirch owns the broadcasting rights to the next two World Cup tournaments and plans to sell the UK franchise to the highest bidder. BSkyB or another pay-TV operator would have the financial muscle to outbid the BBC and ITV in an auction. Kirch believes a victory for the Danish company in the Lords appeal will set a precedent for an EU-based group to bypass UK legislation. This states World Cup matches must be shown on terrestrial TV. The ITC is appealing to the Lords against a court of appeal ruling that said TVDanmark could charge Danish viewers to watch its live coverage of the national team's World Cup qualifiers. Danish national law protects the matches from being shown exclusively on pay-TV but TVDanmark bypassed the rules because it is based in the UK. It also argues ITC regulations should not apply to its broadcasts, as the programmes are received in Denmark. A UK source close to the negotiations between the BBC, ITV and Kirch said he expected the ITC to win the appeal. \"Clearly the case has strong implications but we are confident the decision will be overturned, as the ITC's position was upheld in the first place. \"We strongly believe that UK parliamentary legislation should be respected,\" said the source. Mr Smith is determined to prevent a rights auction and has stated the World Cup matches must be shown on a free-to-air channel. This is because they are on a list of sporting events of national importance enshrined in the 1996 UK Broadcasting Act. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport this week entered a motion in parliament requesting permission for Mr Smith to give evidence at the House of Lords hearing. The MPs' early day motion, published today, urges Mr Smith and the ITC \"to do all in their power\" to ensure the World Cup is freely available to UK viewers. \"This house...views with alarm the attempts of the rights holders to the 2002 and 2006 tournaments, the German media company Kirch, to circumvent the 1996 Act and auction the bulk of the broadcasting rights to subscription TV companies,\" the motion states. It goes on to argue that: \"this great event of huge national and international importance\" should continue to be shown on terrestrial TV. The motion has been signed by six MPs. They are the former Tory heritage secretary Virginia Bottomley, her husband Peter Bottomley and Labour MPs John Grogan, Anne Begg, Jim Murphy and Joan Whalley.

In 1988, in order to cut public expenditure, the Conservatives installed the social fund under which most grants were replaced by loans, although grants to enable people to return to the community were retained. The awards were discretionary and limited to the budgets of local social security offices.</p> <p>The effect on poor families was devastating. Few receive the community care grants, but, in 1999-2000, 1,946,000 loans were made with re-payments deducted at source. In Easterhouse, Glasgow, I often meet families wanting furniture, washing machines, prams - even food. Among the last 50 families that our project helped with their financial difficulties, 72% had social fund loans and were paying back \u00a35, \u00a37, \u00a39, \u00a313 or more, a week. Consequently, their cash incomes were, for instance, \u00a390, \u00a385, \u00a379 or less. Their experiences confirm larger studies that families with such repayments then go short of daily living requirements.</p> <p>Further, in 1998-99, 689,000 applications for loans were rejected. Often, the officials considered the applicants too poor to pay back. Others got nothing because the local budget was exhausted. So even those considered eligible for and needy of social fund loans were turned away.</p> <p>Social fund recipients may have gained a new item via the loan but their families soon need shoes, a replacement bed, clothes, etc. Their deductions make it impossible to save. Like those rejected for the official loans, many turn to private loan companies. Door-to-door salespersons provide cheques or vouchers to be used in certain shops - at interest rates many times that charged by high street banks.</p> <p>Provident Financial, the personal finances services group which focuses on credit, cash collections and insurance, now has almost as many debtors as the social fund. Its pre-tax profits on home credit services have soared from \u00a388m in 1994 to \u00a31.5bn in 1999.</p> <p>The poor find other ways to try and make ends meet. Families walk into shops that do not investigate customers' credit standing, which require no deposit, which deliver washing machines, TVs, etc straightaway - the eventual cost of which is more than double the original price. The poor pay more - and get less.</p> <p>The social fund is supposed \"to help people with needs which are difficult to meet from regular income\". It fails. So glaring are its faults that Robin Cook, when shadow social security spokesperson, declared: \"I would like to see the social fund go... if a family needs a new cooker... it needs a single payment.\" On taking office, New Labour did a u-turn and decided against any reform. Only after persistent campaigning from churches, voluntary groups and poor people themselves, is the social fund again receiving political attention. What should be done?</p> <p>First, at the very least, budgets should be increased so that loans can be made to all eligible claimants.</p> <p>Second, and better, the grants system should be restored. Professor Gary Craig of the University of Hull estimates this would cost \u00a3800m a year - less than the wretched Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Third, and alternatively, each family surviving long-term on benefits should receive an annual bonus sufficient to buy one major domestic item but would have no access to the social fund. Without the labour intensive processing of applications, the administrative saving would be about \u00a3215m a year.</p> <p>But these reforms address the symptom, not the cause. All families should have incomes adequate for a decent lifestyle. The money should come from direct taxation on those who have too much - some of whom pretend to be socialists - and who take incomes of \u00a370,000 and more. In case New Labour has forgotten, it is called greater equality. </p> <p>\u0095 Bob Holman is professor of social administration at the University of Bath.

Their experiences confirm larger studies that families with such repayments then go short of daily living requirements. Further, in 1998-99, 689,000 applications for loans were rejected. Often, the officials considered the applicants too poor to pay back. Others got nothing because the local budget was exhausted. So even those considered eligible for and needy of social fund loans were turned away. Social fund recipients may have gained a new item via the loan but their families soon need shoes, a replacement bed, clothes, etc. Their deductions make it impossible to save. Like those rejected for the official loans, many turn to private loan companies. Door-to-door salespersons provide cheques or vouchers to be used in certain shops - at interest rates many times that charged by high street banks. Provident Financial, the personal finances services group which focuses on credit, cash collections and insurance, now has almost as many debtors as the social fund. Its pre-tax profits on home credit services have soared from \u00a388m in 1994 to \u00a31.5bn in 1999. The poor find other ways to try and make ends meet. Families walk into shops that do not investigate customers' credit standing, which require no deposit, which deliver washing machines, TVs, etc straightaway - the eventual cost of which is more than double the original price. The poor pay more - and get less. The social fund is supposed \"to help people with needs which are difficult to meet from regular income\". It fails. So glaring are its faults that Robin Cook, when shadow social security spokesperson, declared: \"I would like to see the social fund go... if a family needs a new cooker... it needs a single payment.\" On taking office, New Labour did a u-turn and decided against any reform. Only after persistent campaigning from churches, voluntary groups and poor people themselves, is the social fund again receiving political attention. What should be done? First, at the very least, budgets should be increased so that loans can be made to all eligible claimants. Second, and better, the grants system should be restored. Professor Gary Craig of the University of Hull estimates this would cost \u00a3800m a year - less than the wretched Millennium Dome. Third, and alternatively, each family surviving long-term on benefits should receive an annual bonus sufficient to buy one major domestic item but would have no access to the social fund. Without the labour intensive processing of applications, the administrative saving would be about \u00a3215m a year. But these reforms address the symptom, not the cause. All families should have incomes adequate for a decent lifestyle. The money should come from direct taxation on those who have too much - some of whom pretend to be socialists - and who take incomes of \u00a370,000 and more. In case New Labour has forgotten, it is called greater equality. \u0095 Bob Holman is professor of social administration at the University of Bath.

Falkirk council decided to withdraw from Cosla yesterday, redirecting its \u00a371,000 membership fee to care for elderly people, while Clackmannanshire council is set to reach its decision at a budget meeting tomorrow night. The moves follow last week's decision by Scotland's largest council, Glasgow, to pull out and make its own representations directly to the Scottish executive and the parliament. Its \u00a3300,000 membership fee will now be spent on special needs education for autistic children. Meanwhile, South Lanarkshire - Scotland's fifth largest council - is also threatening to withdraw from Cosla and another, Renfrewshire, has said it is examining its position. Falkirk's decision came after the Scottish National Party successfully challenged the minority Labour administration's budget and forced the council to withdraw from Cosla. Council leader John Connolly said: \"Personally I am disappointed by the council's decision as I believe Cosla has been effective in promoting the interests of local authorities. I believe our best chance for further change would be to remain in Cosla and lobby collectively for the good of local government.\" Clackmannanshire's decision seems certain to be ratified at a budget meeting tomorrow, when the ruling SNP group is likely to redirect its \u00a325,000 membership fee to extend opening hours for youth centres.

      "bodyText": "E-commerce agency Entranet has slashed its workforce in a move described by staff as a \"Valentine's Day massacre\". Entranet, which develops e-commerce strategies for clients, this week laid off 30 staff and sources suggest the cull may not stop there. Employees are concerned that the number of redundancies could reach 75, from a total of 200 in Entranet's London and Goring offices. \"It's like a Valentine's Day massacre around here and a real embarrassment to the company,\" said one of the Entranet employees laid off. \"We are making 30 staff redundant because of the fast-changing nature of this business,\" Entranet said. \"As the industry matures, there is less demand for certain types of skills, and more demand for others, such as interactive TV.\" We are sorry to be losing some very talented and dedicated people and we'd like to thank them publicly for their tremendous efforts. We will be leaner, fitter, and focused on creating valuable and compelling customer experiences.\" Entranet said it would continue to recruit for specific role and was looking for business development managers, strategic account managers and interactive TV specialists. The agency believes is aiming to become the UK's leading digital developer for the financial services industry, working with clients including Sun Life, Goldfish, Marbles, Eagle Star, the Co-operative Bank and the Woolwich. Entranet joins the growing number of internet services agencies, such as Razorfish and Agency.com, that have suffered due to the slowdown in the internet economy and clients cutting back online budgets. During last year's internet boom Entranet launched a campaign to lure skilled workers to its company by offering a \u00a33,000 bounty. It is not known how many people were recruited in this manner, but at the time Entranet put out a statement saying its market leading position was going to be achieved through the quality of its staff. Less than a year later, Entranet has been forced to react to what it calls a \"ferociously competitive market\" by handing out P45s and one-month's pay to 30 employees.",

Under the terms of the deal, Kirch will buy almost half of EM.TV's 50% stake in formula one holding company SLEC for \u00a3380m and take a 16% stake in EM.TV. \"The company will strengthen its focus on a structural reorganisation and concentrate on its core competencies,\" EM.TV said. EM.TV has been fending off banks that have threatened to shut it down. The company built up massive debts, after spending \u00a3680m buying the Jim Henson Company - which owns the Muppets franchise - and the SLEC stake. EM.TV has been negotiating the rescue funding deal with Kirch since December. The protracted negotiations between the parties appeared to be on the brink of collapse after formula one owner Bernie Ecclestone objected to the deal and said he would exercise an agreement forcing EM.TV to pay \u00a3680m for a further 25% of SLEC. But Mr Ecclestone relented after Kirch said it would guarantee a bank loan to finance the acquisition of the increased holding in SLEC. EM.TV's shares soared in value by more than 35% on the Neuer Markt in Frankfurt on news of the deal, although its current price of 527p is 93% below its high of 7527p in February last year. Analysts said EM.TV was far from out of the woods, as the company has released little information on its financial prospects for the year ahead. One key source of EM.TV's woes was its decision late last year to slash its 2000 profit forecast by 90% following serious accounting errors. However, EM.TV gains complete control of its Junior TV joint venture with Kirch as part of the deal, giving it access to one of the world's biggest film libraries for children's and family entertainment. \"There is plenty of potential in Junior, but they have shown no success in selling it internationally and they need more progress on that front,\" said Sarah Schmitz, media analyst at Commerzbank.

      "byline": "Sarah Boseley, health editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a group of eminent British cardiologists who are referred to, by a certain drug company's sales reps in irreverent moments in the pub, as the Roadshow. They spend a considerable amount of time travelling around the UK and abroad, promoting the company's heart drugs. Some of them earn more from this than their annual salary from their hospital or university. </p> <p>It may well be that these consultants are totally convinced of the value of the medicines and would do it out of conviction even if they were not sometimes paid as much as \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000 a time for an evening lecture which lasts around an hour. But the fact that they receive such large payments undermines the credibility of their opinions. </p> <p>Peter Wilmshurst, consultant cardiologist at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital who has been a constant critic of the relationship between drug companies and doctors, believes the huge sums of money washing around have the potential to skew people's judgments. </p> <p>\"Some members of the Roadshow have spoken fortnightly for the company .. some also receive fees from other companies. It would be naive to imagine that the size of fees do not affect the statements of opinion leaders,\" he wrote in a letter to the Lancet last summer. </p> <p>There is no suggestion that doctors will promote a drug that will do any harm, but they may persuade themselves to promote one drug over another that is just as good. </p> <p>There are always going to be tensions between the altruism inherent in healing the sick and the baser human imperative that drives the pharmaceutical industry to make money. But there are those who say that in parts of British medicine today, the one is being distorted by the other. </p> <p>While the NHS is strapped for cash, the pharmaceutical firms have billions to invest in research and marketing. Doctors from early in their career are under subtle pressure to accept the financial support of the industry. Many see nothing wrong, others feel uncomfortable but shrug it off as the prevailing culture, and some consider that there is a real conflict of interest. </p> <p>Dr Wilmshurst's eyes were opened to the potential for abuse when he was a relatively junior doctor involved in the clinical trials of a new drug for heart failure called amrinone. His team at St Thomas's hospital in London found some patients suffered gastrointestinal disturbances, liver failure and problems with their immune system. \"The company asked us not to publish our adverse findings. Then when we said we had to publish, they threatened us with legal action,\" he says. \"When you are threatened by a multinational with infinite amounts of money, some people might find that a good reason not to go ahead.\" </p> <p>His team published. Others with similar results did not, he says, after senior cardiologists told them their findings were out of line with everyone else's. The drug was withdrawn on safety grounds in 1984, but was sold over the counter in the Philippines and Africa until 1986. </p> <p>Dr Wilmshurst believes little has changed and that the largesse of the drug companies is a malign influence on doctors. \"I don't think it is the majority of the medical profession, but the big problem is often with the big earners. The big earners are offered the biggest amounts of money.\" </p> <p>The Association for the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) disagrees. Doctors, often those who have run trials on a drug, are certainly asked to speak and are paid for it, said spokesman Richard Lay. \"I think that is right and proper. What we do not control is what they actually say.\" </p> <p>He claims it is not unusual for a doctor to dissent from the company line. \"Companies are not in the position of paying doctors to say what they want them to say. These are top people in their field. I would be astonished to hear that people like that are going to give misleading information to an audience of professionals who are intelligent and well-informed in their area.\" </p> <p>Few academic departments could keep going without the revenues from drug company clinical trials. But the money, power and influence games are most noticeable at medical conferences. On the micro level there are corporate logos, ring binders, notepads, pens and bags in which to keep the literature. But that is not all. \"The whole system of paying for doctors to go to conferences by drug companies is corrupt, because a company will not only pay for the air fare, the hotel and the registration fee but also for all the entertainment during the conference,\" says Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet. </p> <p>\"The payback is that they will make sure that doctor goes to all the symposia that promote their drugs. At the major cardiology conferences, almost no doctor will ever pay for any of those things him or herself. It is all paid for by the industry. The whole thing is one massive promotion.\" </p> <p>The ABPI points to its code of practice which says hospitality must be a subsidiary part of a bona fide meeting. \"If there is any suggestion that it is just a good jolly, that is not allowed,\" says Mr Lay. </p> <p>Even so, Dr Horton is concerned by the growing number of these symposia at medical conferences. A study of the published articles that came out of symposia, carried out by Lisa Bero and colleagues in 1992, found that they had \"strong promotional attributes\" and warned that readers should \"approach symposium issues that are sponsored by a single pharmaceutical company with scepticism\". </p> <p>It is hard to step out of line and those who do, such as Dr Wilmshurst, find their careers take a slide. \"You wouldn't get money to do clinical trials if you didn't go along with it,\" says Dr Horton, \"but you are making a Faustian pact by doing so. </p> <p>\"The days of pharmaceutical companies taking doctors out on holiday are over. You can't do that any more - it's been banned. But the way it is done now is very, very heavy.\" </p> <p>Those at the very top of the profession, whose work is readily funded by the Medical Research Council or the Wellcome Trust, do not have to depend on the generosity of drug companies, he says. \"But for people in the middle rank it is very difficult. It starts very young. They are junior doctors and along comes a friendly drug company rep who takes them out to dinner every week. Immediately you become very sympathetic to industry.\" </p> <p>He does not think the UK is any different from America. \"I think it is in some ways worse. The reason is that when you are working in a bit of a downtrodden NHS and along comes the rich company that will take you to wonderful cities at the weekend, you become very susceptible. It is just too easy. It is sad.\" </p> <p>In his recent book, \"Don't Tell the Patient\", Professor Bill Inman, who started the NHS \"yellow card\" scheme for doctors to report to the Department of Health the side effects of the medicines they prescribe and later founded the Drug Safety Unit at Southampton, alleges that drug company \"post marketing surveillance\" schemes, where GPs are paid for filling in forms on the side effects experienced by patients on a new drug, are nothing more than covert marketing. </p> <p>As a result of his campaigning, industry guidelines called Samm (safety assessment of marketed medicines) were agreed, stipulating that no inducement must be offered to a GP. But, says Prof Inman, he has seen a letter from one company doing a so-called Samm study for angina, offering a doctor \u00a3275 to treat four patients with the new drug to be compared with two given the old one. The letter says GPs may enrol up to 18 on the new drug \"but the ratio[new drug to old] will be maintained\". </p> <p>Prof Inman believes it is wrong that the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, the government advisory body responsible for drug safety in the UK, should have so many members with links to industry. So does Charles Medawar of the watchdog body Social Audit. \"I to some extent buy the argument that it is difficult to recruit top people who don't at least have indirect interests,\" he said, \"but the scale is distinctly unhealthy.\" In the latest declaration of interests from the CSM, 15 out of 36 had either shareholdings, fees or paid consultancies from drug companies. </p> <p>\"The very fact that they insist the chairman should have no ties indicates that they think it is significant,\" he said. The present chairman, Alastair Breckenridge, resigned from the advisory board of SmithKline Beecham to take the job. </p> <p>Members leave the room when a drug from a company they have interests in is being discussed. But Joe Collier, professor of medicines policy at St George's hospital school of medicine, says there is \"institutional bias\" - so many on the committee are close to drug companies they cannot help but take an industry point of view.</p>",

They spend a considerable amount of time travelling around the UK and abroad, promoting the company's heart drugs. Some of them earn more from this than their annual salary from their hospital or university. It may well be that these consultants are totally convinced of the value of the medicines and would do it out of conviction even if they were not sometimes paid as much as \u00a33,000-\u00a35,000 a time for an evening lecture which lasts around an hour. But the fact that they receive such large payments undermines the credibility of their opinions. Peter Wilmshurst, consultant cardiologist at the Royal Shrewsbury hospital who has been a constant critic of the relationship between drug companies and doctors, believes the huge sums of money washing around have the potential to skew people's judgments. \"Some members of the Roadshow have spoken fortnightly for the company .. some also receive fees from other companies. It would be naive to imagine that the size of fees do not affect the statements of opinion leaders,\" he wrote in a letter to the Lancet last summer. There is no suggestion that doctors will promote a drug that will do any harm, but they may persuade themselves to promote one drug over another that is just as good. There are always going to be tensions between the altruism inherent in healing the sick and the baser human imperative that drives the pharmaceutical industry to make money. But there are those who say that in parts of British medicine today, the one is being distorted by the other. While the NHS is strapped for cash, the pharmaceutical firms have billions to invest in research and marketing. Doctors from early in their career are under subtle pressure to accept the financial support of the industry. Many see nothing wrong, others feel uncomfortable but shrug it off as the prevailing culture, and some consider that there is a real conflict of interest. Dr Wilmshurst's eyes were opened to the potential for abuse when he was a relatively junior doctor involved in the clinical trials of a new drug for heart failure called amrinone. His team at St Thomas's hospital in London found some patients suffered gastrointestinal disturbances, liver failure and problems with their immune system. \"The company asked us not to publish our adverse findings. Then when we said we had to publish, they threatened us with legal action,\" he says. \"When you are threatened by a multinational with infinite amounts of money, some people might find that a good reason not to go ahead.\" His team published. Others with similar results did not, he says, after senior cardiologists told them their findings were out of line with everyone else's. The drug was withdrawn on safety grounds in 1984, but was sold over the counter in the Philippines and Africa until 1986. Dr Wilmshurst believes little has changed and that the largesse of the drug companies is a malign influence on doctors. \"I don't think it is the majority of the medical profession, but the big problem is often with the big earners. The big earners are offered the biggest amounts of money.\" The Association for the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) disagrees. Doctors, often those who have run trials on a drug, are certainly asked to speak and are paid for it, said spokesman Richard Lay. \"I think that is right and proper. What we do not control is what they actually say.\" He claims it is not unusual for a doctor to dissent from the company line. \"Companies are not in the position of paying doctors to say what they want them to say. These are top people in their field. I would be astonished to hear that people like that are going to give misleading information to an audience of professionals who are intelligent and well-informed in their area.\" Few academic departments could keep going without the revenues from drug company clinical trials. But the money, power and influence games are most noticeable at medical conferences. On the micro level there are corporate logos, ring binders, notepads, pens and bags in which to keep the literature. But that is not all. \"The whole system of paying for doctors to go to conferences by drug companies is corrupt, because a company will not only pay for the air fare, the hotel and the registration fee but also for all the entertainment during the conference,\" says Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet. \"The payback is that they will make sure that doctor goes to all the symposia that promote their drugs. At the major cardiology conferences, almost no doctor will ever pay for any of those things him or herself. It is all paid for by the industry. The whole thing is one massive promotion.\" The ABPI points to its code of practice which says hospitality must be a subsidiary part of a bona fide meeting. \"If there is any suggestion that it is just a good jolly, that is not allowed,\" says Mr Lay. Even so, Dr Horton is concerned by the growing number of these symposia at medical conferences. A study of the published articles that came out of symposia, carried out by Lisa Bero and colleagues in 1992, found that they had \"strong promotional attributes\" and warned that readers should \"approach symposium issues that are sponsored by a single pharmaceutical company with scepticism\". It is hard to step out of line and those who do, such as Dr Wilmshurst, find their careers take a slide. \"You wouldn't get money to do clinical trials if you didn't go along with it,\" says Dr Horton, \"but you are making a Faustian pact by doing so. \"The days of pharmaceutical companies taking doctors out on holiday are over. You can't do that any more - it's been banned. But the way it is done now is very, very heavy.\" Those at the very top of the profession, whose work is readily funded by the Medical Research Council or the Wellcome Trust, do not have to depend on the generosity of drug companies, he says. \"But for people in the middle rank it is very difficult. It starts very young. They are junior doctors and along comes a friendly drug company rep who takes them out to dinner every week. Immediately you become very sympathetic to industry.\" He does not think the UK is any different from America. \"I think it is in some ways worse. The reason is that when you are working in a bit of a downtrodden NHS and along comes the rich company that will take you to wonderful cities at the weekend, you become very susceptible. It is just too easy. It is sad.\" In his recent book, \"Don't Tell the Patient\", Professor Bill Inman, who started the NHS \"yellow card\" scheme for doctors to report to the Department of Health the side effects of the medicines they prescribe and later founded the Drug Safety Unit at Southampton, alleges that drug company \"post marketing surveillance\" schemes, where GPs are paid for filling in forms on the side effects experienced by patients on a new drug, are nothing more than covert marketing. As a result of his campaigning, industry guidelines called Samm (safety assessment of marketed medicines) were agreed, stipulating that no inducement must be offered to a GP. But, says Prof Inman, he has seen a letter from one company doing a so-called Samm study for angina, offering a doctor \u00a3275 to treat four patients with the new drug to be compared with two given the old one. The letter says GPs may enrol up to 18 on the new drug \"but the ratio[new drug to old] will be maintained\". Prof Inman believes it is wrong that the Committee on the Safety of Medicines, the government advisory body responsible for drug safety in the UK, should have so many members with links to industry. So does Charles Medawar of the watchdog body Social Audit. \"I to some extent buy the argument that it is difficult to recruit top people who don't at least have indirect interests,\" he said, \"but the scale is distinctly unhealthy.\" In the latest declaration of interests from the CSM, 15 out of 36 had either shareholdings, fees or paid consultancies from drug companies. \"The very fact that they insist the chairman should have no ties indicates that they think it is significant,\" he said. The present chairman, Alastair Breckenridge, resigned from the advisory board of SmithKline Beecham to take the job. Members leave the room when a drug from a company they have interests in is being discussed. But Joe Collier, professor of medicines policy at St George's hospital school of medicine, says there is \"institutional bias\" - so many on the committee are close to drug companies they cannot help but take an industry point of view.",

There are two separate alliances fighting onchocerciasis (river blindness) in Africa, both involving free drug donations from Merck and bilateral aid from 30 donor nations, organised by the World Bank.

It doesn't.

Brazil offers one route by producing its own generic drugs for Aids, but Brazil is much richer than Africa. There are three other models which could be emulated for an Aids drug programme: Unicef's worldwide child immunisation programme; the World Bank's river blindness campaign; WHO's LF eradication programme.

The assets, to be set aside for all 680,000 children currently born every year, could be realised at 18 either to buy a property, fund further training or help set up a business. For poorer children any extra savings injected by their parents would be matched by the state or local voluntary groups. Downing Street believes the proposal will give the poor a new stake in society, as well as reduce dependence on the week-by-week dripfeed of benefit payments. The measure - which would cost around \u00a3700m in the first year - might also reverse the recent rapid fall in the savings ratio. From 1979 to 1997 the proportion of people without any financial assets doubled from 5% to 10%. Providing the poor with an asset base comparable to the funds typically passed down middle class generations might also help poorer workers through periods of unemployment in an increasingly insecure labour market. The idea was briefly referred to in a speech by the prime minister last week. Already the subject of bipartisan support in the US, the plan is seen within Whitehall as one of Labour's big second term ideas. It has the backing of the education secretary, David Blunkett, who has made a series of speeches on the need for welfare to generate autonomy and individual responsibility. \"It is how we can make a reality of the claim that the welfare state must be a ladder rather than a safety net,\" said one Downing Street source. Government sources were reluctant to spell out the precise sums likely to be realisable at 18, but suggested it could be between \u00a32,000 and \u00a320,000, depending on the precise mix of savings schemes adopted. \"It would be crazy if all the cash was invested in the stock market: there would be a mix,\" said a Downing Street source. They added it was politically more sensible to give the cash to all children at birth, rather than just the poor. Fidelity Investments, one of the biggest unit trust companies in the UK, said yesterday that if someone had invested \u00a31,000 in its UK Growth &amp; Income fund 18 years ago, it would have grown to \u00a312,835 by January 2001. But current projections suggest \u00a31,000 invested in an Individual Savings Account would be worth \u00a33,380 over the next 18 years, mainly due to lower inflation. However, these figures ignore the big impact of matching top-up state funds over the intervening years. The scheme has been brought across the Atlantic by the influential thinktank Institute of Public Policy Research. It is likely to be marketed in Britain as an individual savings account for all children, or a children's trust fund. The government claims that current Isas have had some, but only limited, impact in spreading a savings culture among the poor, but argue the time is ripe to go much further. Labour also believes the proposal - by giving an endowment to all children and restricting matching top-ups to the poor - will protect the principle of a universal welfare state. Policy makers are unlikely to set a precise figure for the endowment before the election, arguing: \"We do not want to go in with hobnailed boots, or set out the precise rules.\" Ministers also recognise that the proposal will require the removal of the many disincentives to save in the benefits system, including the limits on savings for pensioners. Downing Street policy makers accept the scheme may be attacked on the basis that the guarantee of a savings nest egg could lead to the poor splashing out their internally generated savings on short term projects.

      "bodyText": "The government today hailed its \u00a37m police recruitment campaign a huge success. Home office minister Charles Clark said the TV campaign - which featured Falklands War veteran Simon Weston and ex-EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer - has so far attracted 22,563 \"quality responses\". Mr Clark said the Metropolitan Police alone has received almost 2,000 formal expressions of interest. A Home Office spokesman admitted the ultimate success of the campaign would be judged on an increase of \"bobbies on the beat\". However, he claimed the advertising initiative had also raised general appreciation of police work. Home secretary Jack Straw has set out his aim to fill 9,000 police vacancies across the country over the next three years. The campaign was created by M&amp;C Saatchi last August. It features a series of celebrities musing on whether they could handle the day-to-day challenges faced by police officers. It used the endline: \"Could you?\". Following appearances by footballer John Barnes and TV presenter Joan Bakewell, the advertising drive has now moved into its second stage. Nina Wadia, star of BBC2's sketch show Goodness Gracious Me, is now featuring in TV and radio ads in a drive to attract more ethnic recruits into the police force.",

Signatories to the agreement were Guyana, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, St Lucia and St Kitts and Nevis. Suriname also signed on to use the new court of justice because it is a member of the Caribbean community trade bloc, though as a former Dutch colony it never sent cases to the privy council. \"We will spare no resource to ensure that the Caribbean court of justice is celebrated as an icon of Caribbean achievement and an inspiration of what we can do together and achieve,\" said the Barbados prime minister, Owen Arthur. Before the court is established, at least three member countries have to ratify the agreement at their annual summit in July, and governments will have to deposit five years of dues in a special trust fund. It is unlikely to sit before early 2003. It is expected to be based in Trinidad. Several governments need to amend their constitutions, and some will have to hold referendums to get the change approved. Once convened, the court will hear everything from trade disputes to regular criminal and civil cases. Human rights groups fear the new court will be a \"hanging court\", although the leaders say it is an issue of sovereignty. Amnesty International has expressed concern about \"statements made by a number of political leaders in the region, which have appeared to link the supreme court with the expedited use of the death penalty\". Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago already have said they will ratify the court.",

She was the pin-up of the Wehrmacht, admired by Franco and parodied as the Lorelei. She also achieved a certain distinction as one of the few film actresses of the Third Reich who did not at some time enjoy a liaison with Josef Goebbels - a circumstance dictated as much by Veit Harlan's extreme possessiveness as by the propaganda minister's private predilection for dark-eyed brunettes. She was later tried by the Allies for war crimes.</p> <p>Born in Sweden, the daughter of a chemistry professor who sat on the Nobel Prize committee, she initially studied art, but after the death of her parents, who opposed her theatrical ambitions, she went to Berlin to train for the stage under Rudolph Klein-Rogge. A minor part in the film comedy Onkel Brasig (1937) led to her discovery by Veit Harlan, an innovative and vigorous director already much favoured by Goebbels. Harlan gave her the lead in the dark and moody Jugend (1937), a sentimental drama of doomed love, and made her his third wife. Thereafter, until 1945, S\u00f6derbaum appeared exclusively in her husband's productions.</p> <p>Diminutive, but amply blessed with rococo curves, cascading golden hair, violet eyes and a china-doll complexion, Kristina S\u00f6derbaum had the slightly comical look (at least in stills) of a porcine Alice Faye. On screen, glowing in Agfa colour (in use from 1941), she was the embodiment of florid Aryan girlhood, bursting with energy, spirit and gef\u00fchl .</p> <p>A highly popular star, S\u00f6derbaum appealed to German audiences who could enjoy the drama of her regular defloration and death, comforted by the knowledge that this was, after all, a neutral Swedish actress - Goebbels' policy was to cast women from outside the Fatherland (and on at least one occasion from the inmates of the concentration camps) in the parts of wronged, erring or otherwise tainted women. S\u00f6derbaum drowned so frequently on film that she earned the soubriquet of Reichswasserleiche (the National Drowned Corpse).</p> <p>Though most of her later films were expositions of Nazi dogma, a few played as straight romantic melodramas: Verwehte Sp\u00fcren (1938) was later reworked as the Dirk Bogarde vehicle So Long At The Fair; Die Reise Nach Tilsit (also 1938) was an inferior remake of FW Murnau's Sunrise. Its premiere was notable for the abrupt exit of Magda Goebbels, who fancied she saw in the script allusions to her husband's then current affair with the Czech actress Lida Baarova. Titillated audiences were further aroused by glimpses (albeit brief and decorous) of a nude Kristina beneath a slipping mink coat in her next vehicle, Die Unsterbliche Herz (1939).</p> <p>After the invasion of Poland, Goebbels commissioned Jud S\u00fcss (1940), a repulsive travesty of the sentimental Feuchtwanger novel already filmed in England in 1934. Harlan, with hideous deftness, neatly inverted the plot showing an 18th century court infiltrated and perverted by a villainous coterie of Jews who exhibit every vice and loathsome habit.</p> <p>One of the few openly and insistently anti-semitic films of the period, presenting inconceivably gross racist concepts, Jud S\u00fcss was not only a huge box-office success throughout occupied Europe (especially in France), but was also used as an active instrument of the Holocaust, customarily shown in cities before Jewish deportations. After the war, Harlan and S\u00f6derbaum (once again raped and drowned in the film) pleaded, successfully, that they had worked on the film under duress.</p> <p>From 1943 the Harlans were engaged in making the film Kolberg, Goebbels' obsessive riposte to Gone With The Wind (the latter having made him literally ill with envy). This massive historical epic ground to its conclusion during the final months of the war, consuming apparently unlimited resources. Two hundred thousand troops were drafted from the eastern front to appear as extras in battle scenes later cut as detrimental to civilian morale. The Third Reich had collapsed before the film could be generally released, though as a final propaganda stunt prints were parachuted into besieged cities.</p> <p>After the war, S\u00f6derbaum, her husband and their two sons were apprehended by the Allies at Hamburg as they attempted to reach Sweden. S\u00f6derbaum received a five-year ban on working, while Veit Harlan was tried for complicity in war crimes. After a sensational year-long trial he was acquitted. Making the somewhat unlikely claim that she had declined offers of film work from around the world, S\u00f6derbaum then chose to tour provincial Germany in a play written pseudonymously by her husband. The deception was unsuccessful: her appearance provoked hate mail, demonstrations and death threats from former fans.</p> <p>Like many of her contemporaries, S\u00f6derbaum continued to appear - an anachronistic if still youthful curiosity - in a few inferior German films during the 1950s. Veit Harlan refused to hear of his wife abandoning the screen, but following his death in 1964 she began a second and modestly successful career as a photographer. Latterly, she lived and worked in Munich.</p> <p>In interviews, S\u00f6derbaum appeared maternal, tranquil and benign, if none too bright. She displayed little awareness of the past and the rather grotesque nature of her career; neither did she react with the agitated defensiveness of some of her contemporaries (one thinks, for example, of Zarah Leander - another Swede - and the film-maker Leni Riefenstahl).</p> <p>S\u00f6derbaum converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1960s.

Judge Worsley said he then \"deliberately\" sent the message.</p> <p>Paul Hammond had parked his BMW car behind his mother's in the layby on the A13, near Pitsea, Essex, last June.

People who use mobile phones should not in anyway use them while driving.\"</p> <p>Roger Vincent, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), said this was the 16th road death linked with mobile phones in recent years and he called for a blanket ban on using them while driving.</p> <p>\"We fear this case could just be the tip of the iceberg and that many more accidents could be being caused by people sending or trying to read text messages on the move.</p> <p>\"This tragic case underlines the need for the introduction of a specific offence to ban the use of mobile phones while driving.\"</p> <p>Mr Hammond's death is believed to the first involving a driver sending a mobile phone text message while behind the wheel, said Mr Vincent.</p> <p>Policeman Darren Riley, 25, from Somerset, died in May last year when he lost control of his car - the inquest into his death was told that he might have been trying to read a text message while driving.</p> <p>Mr Vincent said: \"We believe that there have been at least 15 road deaths in recent years where mobile phones have been implicated.</p> <p>\"This reinforces Rospa's argument for a specific offence to ban the use of mobile phones while driving.\" <br><b>Press Association</b></p>",

But Judge Worsley said this was \"wholly unbelievable.\" He said: \"I am convinced that he was composing the material part of it as he was approaching the layby.\" The judge also rejected Browning's claim that he had been distracted by the paperwork. The text message read: \"Oh yes! A real scorcher! Well, just leaving Benfleet 4 West Thurrock job no 7 of 11. Shit! call you back.\" The judge agreed with the prosecution that the final sentence of the message was composed by Browning after the crash. Judge Worsley said he then \"deliberately\" sent the message. Paul Hammond had parked his BMW car behind his mother's in the layby on the A13, near Pitsea, Essex, last June. They had arranged to meet up because he had forgotten his glasses. Judge Worsley said: \"In the seconds before the collision, I find that he was keying in a text message with his eyes on that and his concentration on that and off the road.\" The judge said composing a text message to his girlfriend was \"wicked.\" Browning, whose wife is expecting the couple's baby in April was a \"decent family man\", who was a good and reliable driver, said the judge. The court heard that Browning did not know he had hit a person until he saw Mr Hammond's body on the road. His lorry had veered toward the layby scraping the side of Mr Hammond's BMW and his mother's car. Judge Worsley said: \"Text messages are now very cheap and in use by huge numbers and ... a stern deterrent sentence is necessary.\" Speaking outside the court after the sentencing, Mr Hammond's father, Alan, said: \"A lesson has been learnt that mobile phones can be lethal weapons. People who use mobile phones should not in anyway use them while driving.\" Roger Vincent, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), said this was the 16th road death linked with mobile phones in recent years and he called for a blanket ban on using them while driving. \"We fear this case could just be the tip of the iceberg and that many more accidents could be being caused by people sending or trying to read text messages on the move. \"This tragic case underlines the need for the introduction of a specific offence to ban the use of mobile phones while driving.\" Mr Hammond's death is believed to the first involving a driver sending a mobile phone text message while behind the wheel, said Mr Vincent. Policeman Darren Riley, 25, from Somerset, died in May last year when he lost control of his car - the inquest into his death was told that he might have been trying to read a text message while driving. Mr Vincent said: \"We believe that there have been at least 15 road deaths in recent years where mobile phones have been implicated. \"This reinforces Rospa's argument for a specific offence to ban the use of mobile phones while driving.\" Press Association",

      "bodyText": "The government has moved to close potential loopholes in its anti-tobacco legislation created by internet marketing techniques. Under pressure from MPs and the anti-tobacco lobby, public health minister Yvette Cooper has added new clauses to the tobacco advertising and promotion bill to prevent tobacco firms and advertising agencies exploiting \"developments in technology relating to publishing or distributing by electronic means\". There is concern that tobacco advertisers will use email marketing techniques - often called viral marketing - to promote cigarette brands. Emails containing adverts for tobacco that are sent in the course of business will be outlawed, but it is believed that advertising on a website where tobacco products are offered for sale would not be an offence. The government is trying to keep its powers open-ended to allow for future technological developments in marketing. Anti-smoking pressure group ASH backs the government's efforts but recognises the inherent problems in regulating the internet. \"The government is making a good stab at clamping down in this area,\" said Amanda Sandford, research manager at ASH. \"However, the internet, due to its international nature, is notoriously difficult to regulate and, at the moment, there is little the government can do to control anything that is created outside the UK.\" Last month it emerged that British American Tobacco was planning a pan-European lifestyle portal that would drive consumers to bars and restaurants which sold its brands, heightening calls from MPs for clampdowns on tobacco e-marketing. The bill was given its third reading in the Commons on Tuesday night despite Conservative party complaints that the government is \"rushing through\" the legislation. It will now be passed to the House of Lords for further consideration and could be approved by Parliament before the expected general election in May.

      "bodyText": "German media company Kirch is taking the battle to auction off World Cup broadcasting rights to the European court of justice. Kirch is furious EU commissioners have upheld the UK government's argument that all the matches in the 2002 and 2006 tournaments must be made available to free-to-air broadcasters. \"Kirch has filed a complaint to the European court of justice claiming that the European commission has acted illegally. It is important the company makes a legal complaint about this,\" said a source close to Kirch. The pay-TV group is trying to bypass the 1996 UK Broadcasting Act, which states that the BBC or ITV must be allowed to show the entire tournament since it is on a list of sporting events of national importance. In a document submitted to the European court earlier this week, Kirch claimed the commission only brought the UK list of protected events into EU legislation in May last year. Because Kirch bought the rights to the World Cup in September 1996, it claims the blocking of an auction is \"retroactive\" and therefore illegal. \"The commission approved the UK list, knowing that our deal was made in 1996. We think it is a violation of our property rights and a restriction of free trade,\" added the source. If Kirch gets its way, the BBC and ITV will almost certainly lose out in an auction to BSkyB or another pay-TV bidder, as they are only willing to pay \u00a320m for the rights and not the \u00a3180m sought by Kirch. A united front comprising the Independent Television Commission and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport as well as ITV and the BBC, has asserted that the protection of World Cup rights was first enshrined in UK legislation in 1985. One UK broadcasting source close to the stalled negotiations between the BBC, ITV and Kirch criticised the German company's behaviour. \"The essence of the legislation is that there should be fair and reasonable negotiations,\" said the source. \"That does not seem to be the case with Kirch. They are trying to hold the country to ransom. \"There is no way round the listed events legislation - Kirch have absolutely no chance,\" the source added. \"They have paid an enormous amount for the rights and they are trying to claw it back somehow.\" In a further twist to the dispute, a DCMS spokesman admitted that a House of Lords decision in March could overrule the 1996 Broadcasting Act. The ITC is appealing against a court of appeal ruling that said UK-based broadcaster TVDanmark could charge viewers to watch its live coverage of the Danish national team's World Cup qualifiers. The decision was made despite the fact that Danish national law protects the matches from being shown exclusively on pay-TV. \"There is a possibility that it could cause problems, but we will have to wait for the ruling,\" said the DCMS spokesman. Kirch is hoping that the TVDanmark case can be used as a precedent for allowing the World Cup rights auction, as it attempts to recoup the \u00a3670m it paid for the rights.

BT, which supplies 80% of British homes with the phone lines that deliver internet access, has already launched an unmetered wholesale product, Friaco - flat rate internet access call origination. But now regulators says BT must go one step further and open up the whole of its network to rival operators. The upgrade to Friaco is being billed as St Friaco, the patron saint of unmetered access. Friaco allowed operators to pay flat-rate fees for the line between the home and BT local exchange, but not regional exchanges. St Friaco extends this flat-rate charge from local to regional exchanges in the BT network. \"Oftel has taken a series of actions to enable other operators to compete effectively with BT to supply unmetered internet access to consumers,\" said David Edmonds, director general of Oftel. \"Today's decision should ensure that UK consumers continue to have some of the widest choice and lowest prices for internet access in Europe.\" With St Friaco, internet calls can be transferred over BT lines to another operator's telephone network at regional exchanges, thus paving the way for the likes of Energis, Kingston and Colt to offer consumers their own cut-price unmetered services. The new rates will be offered from February 26. Increasing the range of wholesale products available to operators will boost competition in the unmetered access space and lead to cheaper, more versatile packages.

      "body": "<p>Salvadoreans will no doubt look at the number 13 as some kind of curse as they pick themselves up from a second earthquake, just one month after the first. Both happened on the 13th of the month.</p> <p>Frequent aftershocks had become routine since the first quake struck last month, so when the ground began to shake at 8.30 on Tuesday morning, people believed it was yet another brief sideshow to their difficult life of recovery and rehabilitation.</p> <p>But after Tuesday's 6.1 tremor, it was immediately clear to everyone that felt it that this was not so much an aftershock as another earthquake.</p> <p>Meetings at Oxfam's offices in San Salvador came to an abrupt halt as the roof, floors and cables started to shake. Staff ran out into the street along with residents of neighbouring buildings - this now being the spontaneous reaction to the first indication of any tremor.</p> <p>All too soon, the tell-tale signs of a serious earthquake were evident. Traffic lights were out, electricity down and phones were knocked out. Some cellphones still worked and these were soon buzzing with news and updates on what was happening. </p> <p>Within a short time, some of the key facts emerged. Three provinces, southeast of the capital, San Salvador, had been badly affected - Cuscatlan, La Paz and San Vicente, the latter two for the second time.</p> <p>Again, it's the hilly region which has borne the brunt of the damage but in a smaller, more concentrated area than before. The destruction is greater because the epicentre was on land. </p> <p>This time seven towns were damaged, four of them - Candalaria, San Pedro Nonualco, Santa Maria Ostuma and Santa Cruz Analquito - all over again. The casualty figures are still climbing, but more than 230 people have died, nearly 1,700 people have been injured and 2,400 homes destroyed. </p> <p>While Oxfam's existing emergency work - the installation of water tanks and support for local NGOs distributing shelter, food and blankets - is intact, the quake has ruined plans that were being drawn up for relief work in the coming weeks.</p> <p>The mayor of San Emidio was in Oxfam's offices on Monday working out the next consignment of emergency food for 250 people. Less than 24 hours later, his priorities had totally changed. Instead, rescue teams were needed. New places are now on the emergency map and those that were partially damaged are now flattened.</p> <p>The silver lining, if there is such a thing in the aftermath of an earthquake, was the speed and effectiveness with which the government deployed helicopters to send in rescue teams and ferry the injured to hospital.</p> <p>Everyone - including government officials, military personnel and aid workers - was sadly well rehearsed in the procedures needed to deal with this type of emergency.</p> <p>So, too, was Oxfam, whose water and health workers were on site soon after the earthquake. By the afternoon they'd identified key places to start providing emergency water supplies. Water is a vital ingredient to saving and maintaining lives in the disruption that follows an earthquake.</p> <p>Following up on water, Oxfam and its partner organisations are now handing out thousands of family hygiene kits, buckets and plastic sheeting to people who've lost their homes and belongings. </p> <p>Some families believed themselves lucky to have escaped the effects of the first earthquake, only to find their lives wrecked after all. </p> <p>Across El Salvador teams have been hard at work for the past month digging at rubble, restoring public services and clearing main roads. Ordinary people have been clearing piles of timbers that were once their homes, repairing roofs and removing mounds of concrete and bricks. Schools had reopened. </p> <p>It's cruel to see their efforts and progress now dealt such a severe blow. The fear felt in many parts after January's earthquake has returned in greater measure, and for good reason.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Salvadoreans will no doubt look at the number 13 as some kind of curse as they pick themselves up from a second earthquake, just one month after the first. Both happened on the 13th of the month. Frequent aftershocks had become routine since the first quake struck last month, so when the ground began to shake at 8.30 on Tuesday morning, people believed it was yet another brief sideshow to their difficult life of recovery and rehabilitation. But after Tuesday's 6.1 tremor, it was immediately clear to everyone that felt it that this was not so much an aftershock as another earthquake. Meetings at Oxfam's offices in San Salvador came to an abrupt halt as the roof, floors and cables started to shake. Staff ran out into the street along with residents of neighbouring buildings - this now being the spontaneous reaction to the first indication of any tremor. All too soon, the tell-tale signs of a serious earthquake were evident. Traffic lights were out, electricity down and phones were knocked out. Some cellphones still worked and these were soon buzzing with news and updates on what was happening. Within a short time, some of the key facts emerged. Three provinces, southeast of the capital, San Salvador, had been badly affected - Cuscatlan, La Paz and San Vicente, the latter two for the second time. Again, it's the hilly region which has borne the brunt of the damage but in a smaller, more concentrated area than before. The destruction is greater because the epicentre was on land. This time seven towns were damaged, four of them - Candalaria, San Pedro Nonualco, Santa Maria Ostuma and Santa Cruz Analquito - all over again. The casualty figures are still climbing, but more than 230 people have died, nearly 1,700 people have been injured and 2,400 homes destroyed. While Oxfam's existing emergency work - the installation of water tanks and support for local NGOs distributing shelter, food and blankets - is intact, the quake has ruined plans that were being drawn up for relief work in the coming weeks. The mayor of San Emidio was in Oxfam's offices on Monday working out the next consignment of emergency food for 250 people. Less than 24 hours later, his priorities had totally changed. Instead, rescue teams were needed. New places are now on the emergency map and those that were partially damaged are now flattened. The silver lining, if there is such a thing in the aftermath of an earthquake, was the speed and effectiveness with which the government deployed helicopters to send in rescue teams and ferry the injured to hospital. Everyone - including government officials, military personnel and aid workers - was sadly well rehearsed in the procedures needed to deal with this type of emergency. So, too, was Oxfam, whose water and health workers were on site soon after the earthquake. By the afternoon they'd identified key places to start providing emergency water supplies. Water is a vital ingredient to saving and maintaining lives in the disruption that follows an earthquake. Following up on water, Oxfam and its partner organisations are now handing out thousands of family hygiene kits, buckets and plastic sheeting to people who've lost their homes and belongings. Some families believed themselves lucky to have escaped the effects of the first earthquake, only to find their lives wrecked after all. Across El Salvador teams have been hard at work for the past month digging at rubble, restoring public services and clearing main roads. Ordinary people have been clearing piles of timbers that were once their homes, repairing roofs and removing mounds of concrete and bricks. Schools had reopened. It's cruel to see their efforts and progress now dealt such a severe blow. The fear felt in many parts after January's earthquake has returned in greater measure, and for good reason.",

And then you remember that the fearsome grip whitening your knuckles belongs to the leading European actress of her generation: Juliette Binoche, famous for her porcelain beauty and elegant melancholy, evidently blessed with the fists of a trucker. </p> <p>Big, hearty smile. Exchange of how-are-yous. I say fine. She smirks. \"Not too bad,\" comes the reply, before she looks away, puzzled, like it's the first time she's thought about it. Big, hearty laugh. \"Hmm. I guess I'm fine too.\" </p> <p>If the handshake is jarring, the laugh is more so: loud, open-mouthed and utterly at odds with her own iconography. It's the kind of raucous guffaw she delivers repeatedly in Lasse Hallstrom's Chocolat, in which she plays a free-spirited confectioner bringing candies and single-parenthood to an uptight post-war French village. </p> <p>Two days ago Binoche received an Oscar nomination for her troubles (her second; she won best supporting actress for The English Patient in 1997). When asked what she thought of her chances, she allowed herself a \"We'll see\"; hours later, the news wires were brimming with hastily posed pictures of her in celebration, pretending to devour a vast bar of chocolate. </p> <p>Which is not quite what you expect from Juliette Binoche. Neither is the feelgood warmth of Chocolat. \"You think I'm cold?\" she asks. I gabble that that wasn't what I meant. Just that there has been a constant undercurrent of tragedy to the widows, mistresses and blinded artists that have filled her career since her early-80s breakthrough in Godard's Hail Mary. </p> <p>\"Oh, tragedy,\" she says airily. \"Well, yes. But cold doesn't go with tragedy. And anyway, I think the characters I've played have been survivors of tragedy. So, really, they were kind of positive in their way.\" </p> <p>I ask if the move was deliberate, whether the frothiness of her latest project was a conscious attempt to sidestep her image. While I am talking, she nods, as if indulging a harmless but slow-witted child. \"On this movie?\" she says eventually. \"No. That's not what I wanted at all. But to express something like this story, in which there is a light - yes, I wanted that. In life, you have to demand. It clarifies your will. So, for me, more than trying to be different this way, or that way, it's about telling a story I feel connected to, as a human being and an actor.\" </p> <p>Another smile, more fixed this time, then a pregnant pause, and a long, impassive gaze into the middle distance. That's more like it - Juliette Binoche, gazing impassively into the middle distance. </p> <p>The soulful looks and enigmatic silences come as no surprise. After all, despite her protestations, that's what she does best, a half-stunned gravity in keeping with her status as an arthouse heroine with a vocal distaste for Hollywood. So you watch her gazing round the room and assume, as so many have assumed, that she must be thinking of pain, and loss, and the darker corners of philosophy. Until she laughs her silly-me laugh, and you know she was just thinking about lunch, or picking up her laundry. </p> <p>Then she starts talking and you realise you were right the first time. She explains her pain and loss with the straight-faced passion of someone for whom everything else is chit-chat. </p> <p>I mention that she laughs more in Chocolat than in her previous body of work combined. \"Yes, but, I mean... life is tragic. And sometimes you need the distance of laughter, because you don't know why we live, or why we die, or why we're called human beings when we act like animals. So yes, I like to put those questions inside people.\" She reels through a litany of her characters, pointing out how and why they may be troubled, but never tragic. Or cold. </p> <p>\"When I was younger,\" she says, \"I was always the optimist. But the more I go through life, the more I think pessimism is truly realistic. It's more fun, too, because if you are a pessimist you are shocked about the good things.\" Cue laugh. </p> <p>I ask what stemmed her optimism. \"Well, being an optimist was like a disguise. I was using it to get through life, you know? And there is a heaviness with me. It's like when you asked me if I was well. To be truthful, I'm exhausted. But at the same time there is a lightness to my exhaustion, because I chose to be here, and I'm happy if this film makes people happy.\" </p> <p>She segues into an anecdote about a woman with one lung who taught her Gregorian chants, and a lengthy metaphor describing how \"when you break your knee, you enjoy walking differently\". Triumph in adversity, I say hopefully. She nods again, as if the slow-witted child has finally caught up. \"Yes. When we learn that tragedy is a treasure in disguise, then we begin to understand life. It's like when I see a lot of comic films, I feel depressed. Like this is so shallow, and such... nonsense. To me, saying, 'This is tragedy and this is comedy,' putting everything in its box, it doesn't make sense.\" </p> <p>But if she doesn't see the world like that, the directors she has worked with usually have, habitually dispatching her into doomed affairs and bereavements. She may be laughing now, but in the past, the self-conscious auteurs she gravitates towards have forbidden her from doing so, in case it ruins their angst-ridden tableaux. </p> <p>How does it feel, being ordered not to smile? \"Well, sometimes I felt like a horse.\" She pulls at the corners of her mouth, as if wearing a bit. \"Like, I promise I won't gallop. But the relationship between directors and actors is full of competition. And sometimes directors fall under the power of an actress.\" </p> <p>With Binoche they certainly have. Other than tragedy, the recurring motif in her films is their devotion to her face; huge chunks of screen time are given over to her static, masklike features. And the ardour isn't restricted to male film-makers: last week, Gwyneth Paltrow was reported to have signed up for an adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's The Passion on the condition that Binoche play her lover. </p> <p>\"Are you only interested in my face?\" she asks. I can't tell if she's joking. No, I say, but I've read three articles about her in the last two days, all of which have remarked that the best medium for her undoubted beauty may not be movies, but photographs. \"Someone said that? Hmm... maybe it's true then. But I think what's important is behind the face. Anyway, I don't think I have a particularly beautiful face.\" </p> <p>Her features, it would seem, fall into the category of what Binoche regards as trivia. So we move on to ageing instead and - at 36 and playing mothers as routine - she becomes more animated. \"I know it's a big issue,\" she says, \"but truly, for me it's not. I think 20 is a beautiful age, but it's also very difficult. Thirty was better. Forty, who knows? It will be strange for me as an actress, but there are different ways to be seductive. </p> <p>\"It's like, sometimes there is something between you and yourself - the ego, right? And the person with the ego inside you says, 'Oh, I'm angry with this' or 'Oh, I'm jealous of that'. And you have to be tolerant of that little person, and say to them, 'Ssh. It's OK to think that, but you must know that you're wrong.' \" I'm already anticipating our farewell handshake when she lets out another of her laughs. \"Like a teacher. You know?\"</p>",

And the ardour isn't restricted to male film-makers: last week, Gwyneth Paltrow was reported to have signed up for an adaptation of Jeanette Winterson's The Passion on the condition that Binoche play her lover. \"Are you only interested in my face?\" she asks. I can't tell if she's joking. No, I say, but I've read three articles about her in the last two days, all of which have remarked that the best medium for her undoubted beauty may not be movies, but photographs. \"Someone said that? Hmm... maybe it's true then. But I think what's important is behind the face. Anyway, I don't think I have a particularly beautiful face.\" Her features, it would seem, fall into the category of what Binoche regards as trivia. So we move on to ageing instead and - at 36 and playing mothers as routine - she becomes more animated. \"I know it's a big issue,\" she says, \"but truly, for me it's not. I think 20 is a beautiful age, but it's also very difficult. Thirty was better. Forty, who knows? It will be strange for me as an actress, but there are different ways to be seductive. \"It's like, sometimes there is something between you and yourself - the ego, right? And the person with the ego inside you says, 'Oh, I'm angry with this' or 'Oh, I'm jealous of that'. And you have to be tolerant of that little person, and say to them, 'Ssh. It's OK to think that, but you must know that you're wrong.' \" I'm already anticipating our farewell handshake when she lets out another of her laughs. \"Like a teacher. You know?\"",

Mr Straw announced the decision in a written Parliamentary answer last week, which was raised in today's issue of Computer Weekly magazine. German company Siemens Business Services signed a contract in 1996 to set up the system to deal with asylum applications to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), the magazine said. The contract would run until 2003 and, while Siemens would continue to work on improving the existing computer network, the full scheme would not be completed, it was said.

One advert shows a harassed-looking teacher with the strapline, \"Form fillers? Teachers will be teachers under the Conservatives\". The poster campaign has been created by Tory ad agency Yellow M and will be rolled out over the coming month. The theme continues Mr Hague's onslaught on the Labour government's record on public services. The last campaign accused the government of wasting tax-payers' money.

      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said today that the government will consider new bids for the troubled Millennium Dome, possibly ending the hopes of the \u00a3125m Legacy bid. Up to this point, Robert Bourne's Legacy consortium - which would turn the former tourist attraction into a hi-tech business park - has been the only one under government consideration. But the consortium only had until yesterday to maintain its preferred bidder status by reaching an agreement with the government. Speaking today, Lord Falconer said that Legacy had until yesterday to meet government parameters for the sale and, as Mr Bourne's group had not met those parameters, other groups would now be welcome to bid for the dome. He expected to start accepting bids within the next few weeks. Legacy had hoped that yesterday's deadline would be extended. The government has been concerned that Legacy lacks sufficient backing, but yesterday the bid received a boost when the Teesland Group, a property company chaired by a business associate of Mr Bourne, said they will back Legacy by taking a 10% stake. According to the minister responsible for the dome, Lord Falconer, the government pays out well in excess of \u00a31m a month to maintain the building after it stopped accepting visitors on January 1. One bid that the government will now consider is that of the Millennium Dome chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, who wants to turn the dome into an international entertainment venue and visitor attraction. Yesterday he gave the government a 48-hour deadline to make a decision about Legacy's preferred bidder status. Property group Stanhope and engineering company Pell Frischmann may also put in competing bids to develop the dome as a business complex. The dome cost \u00a3958m - half of that from lottery funds and much of which was never recovered - during its one year of operation, but it was the most popular admission-charged visitor attraction in Britain last year. However, at 6.5m visitors, it fell disastrously short of expectations for 12m visitors. The prime minister, Tony Blair, is said to be eager for a quick sale ahead of the expected spring election, but Mr Prescott, is said to support a plan for English Heritage to take control of the dome site, allowing it to remain in public hands. The Legacy consortium, which is largely backed by Irish financiers Treasury Holdings, has argued with Whitehall's demands for a share of any profits made in the first 10 years and a slice of the money made if it is later resold. The treasury is believed to feel the government is attempting to tighten the clauses to avoid later charges that it sold the dome too cheaply. Legacy was made the \"preferred bidder\" last November when Japanese bank Nomura dropped out.

      "body": "<p>Obesity in England is nearing epidemic proportions with one in five adults now dangerously overweight, costing the economy and NHS \u00a32.6bn a year, the national audit office warns today. </p> <p>More than 31,000 people a year are dying prematurely - 6% of all deaths - because of a lifestyle of fatty diets, over-reliance on the car and energy-saving devices such as lifts and escalators. </p> <p>In a stark report sure to revive the spectre of the nanny state, the national audit office (NAO) warns that in 10 years obesity levels could reach those of the US, where a quarter of the population is obese, unless more action is taken by government, employers, the food industry and individuals. </p> <p>In addition to the 21% of women and 17% of men in England regarded as obese, another 32% of women and 46% of men are overweight. This means nearly six in 10 adults - more than 20m people - should change their lifestyles, say the report's authors. </p> <p>England, where obesity levels have tripled in 20 years, already has one of the worst records in Europe. Studies have also shown alarming rises in children's weight. As many as one in 10 children aged four or under is obese, while one in four is overweight, research in the British Medical Journal revealed last week. </p> <p>Philip James, the professor who first persuaded Tony Blair to establish the food standards agency, and who now chairs the International Obesity Taskforce, suggested there should be a new public health lifestyle council, as exists in some Scandinavian countries, together with a cabinet-rank minister to tackle public health reforms \"forgotten since the advent of the NHS.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We need to focus on transforming the diet of children and adults, even if the initiatives threaten some components of the food and soft drinks industries.\" </p> <p>Obesity is measured using body mass index (BMI), which is the person's weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared. A BMI of 20 to 25 is normal, 25 to 30 is overweight and more than 30 is obese. A man of about 5ft 10in weighing more than 15 stone or a woman of 5ft 6in and 13.5 stone would be regarded as obese. </p> <p>The report says treating obesity and related illnesses cost the NHS about \u00a3500m in 1998. The loss to the economy, through 18m days of sickness and 40m days of working life through early death of workers, was \u00a32.1m. But this took no account of conditions where proportions due to obesity could not be calculated, including back pain, one of the most common causes of absences. </p> <p>The report illustrates changing lifestyles by using earlier studies which suggested the number of 17-year-olds walking to school fell from 59% to 49% between 1986 and 1996 while car journeys to schools doubled.

      "bodyText": "Obesity in England is nearing epidemic proportions with one in five adults now dangerously overweight, costing the economy and NHS \u00a32.6bn a year, the national audit office warns today. More than 31,000 people a year are dying prematurely - 6% of all deaths - because of a lifestyle of fatty diets, over-reliance on the car and energy-saving devices such as lifts and escalators. In a stark report sure to revive the spectre of the nanny state, the national audit office (NAO) warns that in 10 years obesity levels could reach those of the US, where a quarter of the population is obese, unless more action is taken by government, employers, the food industry and individuals. In addition to the 21% of women and 17% of men in England regarded as obese, another 32% of women and 46% of men are overweight. This means nearly six in 10 adults - more than 20m people - should change their lifestyles, say the report's authors. England, where obesity levels have tripled in 20 years, already has one of the worst records in Europe. Studies have also shown alarming rises in children's weight. As many as one in 10 children aged four or under is obese, while one in four is overweight, research in the British Medical Journal revealed last week. Philip James, the professor who first persuaded Tony Blair to establish the food standards agency, and who now chairs the International Obesity Taskforce, suggested there should be a new public health lifestyle council, as exists in some Scandinavian countries, together with a cabinet-rank minister to tackle public health reforms \"forgotten since the advent of the NHS.\" He added: \"We need to focus on transforming the diet of children and adults, even if the initiatives threaten some components of the food and soft drinks industries.\" Obesity is measured using body mass index (BMI), which is the person's weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared. A BMI of 20 to 25 is normal, 25 to 30 is overweight and more than 30 is obese. A man of about 5ft 10in weighing more than 15 stone or a woman of 5ft 6in and 13.5 stone would be regarded as obese. The report says treating obesity and related illnesses cost the NHS about \u00a3500m in 1998. The loss to the economy, through 18m days of sickness and 40m days of working life through early death of workers, was \u00a32.1m. But this took no account of conditions where proportions due to obesity could not be calculated, including back pain, one of the most common causes of absences. The report illustrates changing lifestyles by using earlier studies which suggested the number of 17-year-olds walking to school fell from 59% to 49% between 1986 and 1996 while car journeys to schools doubled. Average television watching in England doubled from 13 hours a week to 26 over 30 years to the mid-1990s and a recent government-funded study of the diet of 4 to 18-year-olds revealed average consumption of fruit, vegetables and fruit juice was 188 grams a day, less than half the 400g recommended for adults. Life expectancy The report says problems of obesity and excess weight increase with age, so that while less than 30% of 16 to 24-year-olds are above normal levels, seven in 10 over-65s have a problem. The prevalence of obesity grows among lower socio-economic groups. Obesity is reducing life expectancy by nine years on average, according to the report. But only one in seven health authorities has a plan to prevent or treat obesity and only 40% of GPs attempt to identify patients at highest risk of excessive weight gain.

The Magnificent Seven, which is being made by Sunday Service producer Ten Alps, will pit seven people with diverging political views against each other. Ten Alps is currently looking for seven \"political mavericks\" to spend a week in a bed and breakfast debating and testing each other's political convictions. Each day the \"Select Committee\", a panel of 5 Live listeners chaired by the landlady of the B&amp;B, will decide which one of the contestants to throw off the show, until a winner emerges. \"The Magnificant Seven will converge on a dreary bed and breakfast in a mystery town,for a week of political infighting,\" said a Ten Alps spokesman. \"We like to think of it as Temptation Island meets On the Record meets Hotel. There are also elements of The Mole.\" \"The idea is to recapture what we briefly had in the petrol crisis - politics as direct action by interest groups, engaging real people without the intermediary of parties, spinmeisters and manifestos.\" The contestants will be expected to perform two daily tasks. They will take part in a serious Teatime Debate, discussing issues such as National Health Service privatisation over tea and biscuits. There is also to be a more lighthearted Test of Political Skills. In addition, Magnificent Seven contestants will be subjected to a Primary School Question Time, interrogation by an ex-CIA agent and choosing between a five-star gourmet lunch and working in a soup kitchen for the Naked Bribery feature. Listeners will get the chance to quiz the contestants in phone-ins. The Magnificant Seven is expected to air sometime in March, with the exact scheduling dependent on the date of the general election. It will be broadcast on 5 Live for eight consecutive days, with three or four daily instalments varying in length from a few minutes to half-an-hour. The show is being produced by Sam Cash, son of Tory MP Bill Cash and co-creator of Sunday Service.",

      "bodyText": "The closer the date comes for the biggest currency changeover most Europeans have ever seen - the advent of euro notes and coins on January 1 next year - the more reluctant Germans seem to be to relinquish the mark. In the latest survey by the Forsa polling institute 71% of those questioned said they would hold on to the mark if they had the choice. The figure rose to 80% among people over 60. Only 27% were for the adoption of the euro, placing Germany 11th in the euro-enthusiasm ratings among the 12 countries that have agreed to adopt the single currency. The fear of losing the mark is greatest in the formerly communist east, where the survey showed that 83% want to keep it. In recognition of people's deep affection for the mark, which came into being more than 52 years ago, the Bundesbank is using a small part of its gold reserves to issue a commemorative 12-gram pure gold mark piece. A million of these \"farewell deutschmarks\" are to be produced in the five state mints to go on sale this summer for between DM230 and 250 (\u00a375-\u00a383 at current rates), depending on the gold price at the time. But while the authorities turn out this expensive keepsake, it is the ordinary mark in people's pockets that is the object of an outpouring of tributes. Newspapers are counting down to the mark's disappearance, and columnists are lamenting its demise. \"In our memory it will remain an immense, rich, and wonderfully beautiful treasure,\" one wrote recently in Die Welt. Dieter Lindenlaub, historian and archivist at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, said: \"The degree of identity attached to the D-mark is very high, because it's connected to a piece of positive German history\" - namely the economy's strong recovery after the war. \"It is seen as an integral piece of Germany, and there is a strong sense that no other currency can offer us the [same] level of stability.\" The deutschmark was born on June 21 1948, when a currency reform law was passed to replace the reichsmark. One hundred reichsmarks were worth 10 deutschmarks. \"It was a huge attempt to kick-start the economy after the war,\" Professor Lindenlaub said. \"People initially saw themselves as victims of financial reform, but there was a general acceptance that we had to pay for the war.\" By the beginning of 1950 the so-called economic miracle, the wirtschaftswunder, was well under way. Prof Lindenlaub believes it will be far harder to persuade the Germans that conversion to the euro is a positive step. \"It was easier to build acceptance in 1948 because it was an attempt to make good money out of bad,\" he said. \"Now the Germans widely believe to accept the euro is to turn good money into bad.\" But anticipating the mark's death, the Bundesbank has awarded a contract to a Bremen firm to turn more than 3,000 tonnes of banknotes into the most richly denominated compost in the world.",

Following the quashing of Stone's conviction last week, Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Maurice Kay and Mrs Justice Hallett gave their reasons for not freeing Stone but making him face another trial. Lord Justice Kennedy, reading from a 15-page written judgment, said the central question in a new trial would not be Stone's character, but whether the evidence of the key prosecution witness could be believed. He said that \"in justice to the Russell family and the wider community\" there should be a retrial to answer that question. Stone was given three life sentences at Maidstone crown court in 1998 after being convicted of the two murders, and the attempted murder of Josie near the Russell family home at Chillenden, Kent, in 1996. The judges ruled last week that Stone's appeal \"must succeed\" on the basis of the unreliability of the key prosecution witness Barry Thompson, who gave evidence at the trial alleging Stone had confessed to the killings in prison. Yesterday, Lord Justice Kennedy said that \"the evidence of Thompson has been shown to be hopelessly unreliable\". Stone's counsel, William Clegg QC, had argued that he could not have a fair trial because of \"prejudicial\" material in the media following the original trial. But Nigel Sweeney QC, for the crown, submitted that a fair trial was possible. Stone was given three life sentences for the two murders and attempted murder. Lin, Megan and Josie Russell were tied up and beaten with a hammer in a 15-minute attack. Lord Justice Kennedy said the question for the court was whether it could be satisfied \"on a balance of probabilities\" that if a jury later this year returned a verdict of guilty, \"the effect of the pre-trial publicity between October 1998 and February 2001 will be such as to render that verdict or those verdicts unsafe\". He went on: \"We accept that the early publicity was sensational, possibly in parts inaccurate, and extended far beyond what a jury in 2001 might normally be told, but, at least in so far as it was accurate, it was legitimate.\" The judge said: \"The retrial will not start until nearly three years after the October 1998 publicity, which is the principal target of complaint, and people do forget.

      "byline": "Tony Grayling",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Two out of three journeys by public transport are made by bus. Yet buses are the Cinderella of travel, a poor relation to trains. Labour's 10-year transport plan promised \u00a360bn in public and private investment in railways, delivering a 50% increase in passenger miles. The equivalent target for buses is a 10% increase in passenger journeys, less than the 17% forecast for overall growth in road traffic. The only new money specifically for buses in the 10-year plan is \u00a340m for an urban bus \"challenge fund\", together with a previously announced increase for rural services.</p> <p>While the trains target was based on an analytical model, the target for buses was plucked out of the air, except for London. Here the 10-year plan projects 50% growth in bus journeys both into central London and across the conurbation. Given that the capital accounts for 30% of bus journeys in Britain, government planners seem to be assuming bus use in the rest of the country will continue to fall.</p> <p>All local transport authorities will be required to develop bus strategies as part of their statutory local transport plans, but their powers are weak. Under the latest transport act, \"quality partnerships\" may see councils requiring higher vehicle standards and better customer care from bus operators in return for bus lanes and other infrastructure improvements. Councils will seek better information for passengers and transferability of tickets between operators but the fundamentals of fares and frequencies will remain in the hands of the private operators.</p> <p>Councils may pay for concessionary fares. A national minimum half fare concession for pensioners and disabled people will apply from April. Concessions may be extended to children and job seekers. A half fare concession for 16 to 18-year-olds in education could be the basis for bringing in the Social Exclusion Unit's idea of a \"youth card\" combining entitlement to college courses with cut price travel and other discounts.</p> <p>Since the deregulation of bus services outside London under Tory legislation in 1985, bus use has fallen by a third. The chart shows the steep fall in the urban areas of England. But in London it has increased by 13%. The capital is good bus territory with its high population density, traffic congestion and low car ownership. The big thing is that bus services in London were not deregulated. They were contracted out, so that the operators compete for the licences to run each route for a fixed term, usually five years.</p> <p>London has maintained the benefits of a planned network with fares and ticketing integrated with rail and tube and savings have been made thanks to competition between firms to operate services. Wages and conditions have also been driven down, as they have outside London. Bus drivers in Britain now earn on average about half the hourly rate of train drivers. This is an unsustainable position in a buoyant labour market as well as undesirable for the quality of services.</p> <p>The secret of London's success is a comprehensive approach to the improvement of bus services and the mayor has acquired extensive transport powers. They include enforcing a network of bus lanes to make services faster and more reliable: the power that London boroughs have to use cameras and impose penalty charges should be extended to all local authorities. London is also leading the way with the introduction of smartcard ticketing and congestion charging.</p> <p>Alone among countries in the European Union the UK has seen significant decline in bus use since the 70s. In Italy and Denmark passenger miles have more than doubled. A variety of factors underpin our poor performance. One is that no other EU nation has opted for deregulation, though a number have followed London's example by introducing competition to operate services. The UK could also learn from performance-incentive regimes, such as Copenhagen's where every three months the best operator gets a bonus, based on customer satisfaction surveys.</p> <p>Another major factor is that fare subsidies are seen as a normal part of life on mainland Europe, as are the local taxes to pay for them. The low fares policies pursued in London, South Yorkshire and other metropolitan areas were brought to an end by the nationalisation of London Transport and deregulation outside London in the mid 80s. Since then, average bus fares have increased by more than 30% in real terms.</p> <p>New research suggests that the long-term effect of fare increases is worse than previously thought, typically a 9% decrease in passengers for a 10% increase in fares. There is no mechanism for general fare subsidies under bus quality partnerships. By contrast, key rail fares are pegged to increase by 1% less than inflation each year as part of a passenger franchise.</p> <p>The government should have the same ambition for buses as for trains. The social case is strong given that people on low incomes make three times as many journeys by bus as those on high incomes, who make more than four times as many journeys by train. The transport act includes provisions for contracts between councils and firms which could see them introducing regulated networks - but ministers are holding this power in reserve.

      "bodyText": "Two out of three journeys by public transport are made by bus. Yet buses are the Cinderella of travel, a poor relation to trains. Labour's 10-year transport plan promised \u00a360bn in public and private investment in railways, delivering a 50% increase in passenger miles. The equivalent target for buses is a 10% increase in passenger journeys, less than the 17% forecast for overall growth in road traffic. The only new money specifically for buses in the 10-year plan is \u00a340m for an urban bus \"challenge fund\", together with a previously announced increase for rural services. While the trains target was based on an analytical model, the target for buses was plucked out of the air, except for London. Here the 10-year plan projects 50% growth in bus journeys both into central London and across the conurbation. Given that the capital accounts for 30% of bus journeys in Britain, government planners seem to be assuming bus use in the rest of the country will continue to fall. All local transport authorities will be required to develop bus strategies as part of their statutory local transport plans, but their powers are weak. Under the latest transport act, \"quality partnerships\" may see councils requiring higher vehicle standards and better customer care from bus operators in return for bus lanes and other infrastructure improvements. Councils will seek better information for passengers and transferability of tickets between operators but the fundamentals of fares and frequencies will remain in the hands of the private operators. Councils may pay for concessionary fares. A national minimum half fare concession for pensioners and disabled people will apply from April. Concessions may be extended to children and job seekers. A half fare concession for 16 to 18-year-olds in education could be the basis for bringing in the Social Exclusion Unit's idea of a \"youth card\" combining entitlement to college courses with cut price travel and other discounts. Since the deregulation of bus services outside London under Tory legislation in 1985, bus use has fallen by a third. The chart shows the steep fall in the urban areas of England. But in London it has increased by 13%. The capital is good bus territory with its high population density, traffic congestion and low car ownership. The big thing is that bus services in London were not deregulated. They were contracted out, so that the operators compete for the licences to run each route for a fixed term, usually five years. London has maintained the benefits of a planned network with fares and ticketing integrated with rail and tube and savings have been made thanks to competition between firms to operate services. Wages and conditions have also been driven down, as they have outside London. Bus drivers in Britain now earn on average about half the hourly rate of train drivers. This is an unsustainable position in a buoyant labour market as well as undesirable for the quality of services. The secret of London's success is a comprehensive approach to the improvement of bus services and the mayor has acquired extensive transport powers. They include enforcing a network of bus lanes to make services faster and more reliable: the power that London boroughs have to use cameras and impose penalty charges should be extended to all local authorities. London is also leading the way with the introduction of smartcard ticketing and congestion charging. Alone among countries in the European Union the UK has seen significant decline in bus use since the 70s. In Italy and Denmark passenger miles have more than doubled. A variety of factors underpin our poor performance. One is that no other EU nation has opted for deregulation, though a number have followed London's example by introducing competition to operate services. The UK could also learn from performance-incentive regimes, such as Copenhagen's where every three months the best operator gets a bonus, based on customer satisfaction surveys. Another major factor is that fare subsidies are seen as a normal part of life on mainland Europe, as are the local taxes to pay for them. The low fares policies pursued in London, South Yorkshire and other metropolitan areas were brought to an end by the nationalisation of London Transport and deregulation outside London in the mid 80s. Since then, average bus fares have increased by more than 30% in real terms. New research suggests that the long-term effect of fare increases is worse than previously thought, typically a 9% decrease in passengers for a 10% increase in fares. There is no mechanism for general fare subsidies under bus quality partnerships. By contrast, key rail fares are pegged to increase by 1% less than inflation each year as part of a passenger franchise. The government should have the same ambition for buses as for trains. The social case is strong given that people on low incomes make three times as many journeys by bus as those on high incomes, who make more than four times as many journeys by train. The transport act includes provisions for contracts between councils and firms which could see them introducing regulated networks - but ministers are holding this power in reserve. Without such powers and better funding, even the government's small ambitions for buses are not likely to be fulfilled. \u0095 Tony Grayling is at the Institute of Public Policy Research.

      "bodyText": "Russia sent a number of nuclear-capable and supersonic bomber aircraft on exercises along the Japanese and Norwegian coasts yesterday for the first time in years, triggering protests from Tokyo about violations of airspace, and the scrambling by Norway of F-16 fighters to ward off the Russians. The Japanese defence ministry reported two brief incursions into Japanese airspace in incidents that recalled the cat-and-mouse games of the cold war, first of four Tu22 Backfire bombers and then of another two Russian aircraft about two and a half hours later. Tokyo said it was the first such incident in six years involving Russian aircraft. The timing of the incidents was odd since President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan had just concluded weeks of tortuous negotiations and agreed on a summit in the Russian far east set for next month. The Japanese foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador in Tokyo to lodge a protest about the airspace violations. The incursions are said to have taken place off the northern tip of Japan on the other side of Hokkaido from the disputed Kurile islands which Moscow seized in the second world war and whose return Tokyo is demanding. Each incursion was said to have lasted three minutes. The Russian defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, categorically denied any airspace violations, declaring that six Russian bombers were engaged in exercises hugging the Japanese coastline, but not intruding. \"We analysed all our flights,\" Marshal Sergeyev told the Interfax news agency. \"There were no violations.\" A few months ago in the far east, Russian Sukhoi-27 fighters buzzed an American aircraft carrier several times, suggesting that under President Putin, the Russian air force was behaving more boldly and assertively than it did throughout the 1990s. At the other end of Russia, meanwhile, Norwegian military officials said they had scrambled two F-16 fighters to keep a watch on two Russian nuclear-capable Tu-160 Blackjack bombers in international airspace close to Norway's northern border. Norwegian officers said Moscow had told Norway and Britain that its aircraft could approach both countries' coasts this week as it was stepping up air exercises from its Kola peninsula bases in the Arctic where the nuclear submarine Kursk sank last August.",

      "bodyText": "International opprobrium was directed at Israel yesterday for its state-approved assassinations of suspected terrorists - a practice widely regarded as illegal. A Foreign Office spokesman said the British government was shocked by what it described as the \"murder\" of one of Yasser Arafat's bodyguards by Israeli forces on Tuesday and of nine Israeli soldiers by a Palestinian yesterday. \"We condemn all acts of violence and urge both sides to refrain from reprisals. Neither side will gain from an escalation of the violence,\" the spokesman said. Earlier, the outgoing Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, had publicly congratulated Israeli forces on the killing of the bodyguard, Massoud Ayad, whose car was rocketed by two helicopters. Yesterday's attack, in which a Palestinian driver ploughed into Israeli soldiers at a bus stop, is thought to be a reprisal for Ayad's killing. \"This is exactly the kind of escalation we had feared,\" said a European diplomat close to recent peace negotiations. Mr Barak's security adviser, Danny Yatom, defended the assassination of Ayad, telling Israel Radio: \"We don't take pride in liquidating terrorists. We are in the midst of a battle, in the midst of a war against terrorism, and in this war we must strike at those who [threaten Israel].\" He described Mr Ayad, 53, an \"arch terrorist\" linked to the Lebanon-based organisation Hizbollah. Britain has also backed one of the strongest statements yet from the European Union. In a declaration issued by current president Sweden, the EU said it \"deplores the practice of so-called \"eliminations\" or extra-judicial killings of Palestinians carried out by Israeli security forces\". The EU, which is Israel's biggest trading partner, reiterated \"its strongly held opinion that Israel's policy in this regard is unacceptable and contrary to the rule of law\". It continued: \"The European Union urges Israel to cease this practice and thus respect international law.\" The United States, while also condemning Palestinian violence, made clear its disapproval of the assassinations. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: \"The use of Israeli helicopter gunships, Palestinian attacks against settlements and motorists, the use of mortars by Palestinians and the targeted killings by the Israeli Defence Force ... are producing a new cycle of action or reaction which can become impossible to control.\" Mr Boucher added that the new Secretary of State, Colin Powell, who is due to visit the Middle East next week, had spoken several times \"about the need to avoid these kind of actions\". Apart from the risk of provoking reprisals which escalate the violence, liquidations have also caused unintended casualties. Israel began selective assassinations of suspected senior Intifada militants in November, sending helicopter gunships to kill Hussein Abayat in Bethlehem on the same day that Mr Arafat was visiting the White House in Washington. On that occasion, the rocket which hit the vehicle in which Mr Abayat was travelling also killed two elderly Palestinian women nearby and injured 10 other people. More than 20 Palestinians have been liquidated by Israeli forces in targeted attacks. Under international law, the assassinations are illegal unless the Israelis and Palestinians are considered to be at war. Colonel Daniel Reisner, the Israeli military's head of international law, wrote recently in a briefing document: \"International law actually only recognises two situations: peace and war. But life isn't as simple as that.\" He continued: \"We have reached the decision that the current situation has more of a semblance of war than of peace. As a result, we are also applying the principles applicable to warfare to the current situation.\" This led him to conclude that the assassination of various Palestinian activists and militia leaders could be justified under the rules of war. \"You are allowed to target combatants,\" he wrote. \"In the current situation, people who attack us have been identified by us as combatants. As a result we view them as legitimate targets. That specific individual falls under that category, therefore he was attacked and killed.\" For the Israelis, one problem with this interpretation is that it would also have to apply equally to the Palestinians. Palestinians would then be legally entitled to kill Israeli soldiers (as happened yesterday) and anyone else they regard as a combatant, such as armed settlers.

      "body": "<p>When Tony Blair said a week ago that he would assess the economic case for entry into the euro within two years of the election, the only resonance came from the reactions of his enemies. His words weren't a serious departure. Perhaps he didn't know when he would say them, but it was always his plan to say something soon. To wait until the brink of the campaign to declare what was meant by the sheltering mantra \"early in the next parliament\" would have been politically crazy. Knowing he would be dogged for an answer, he needed to supply it before the question became a focus of obsessive and sceptical attention.</p> <p>The response, though, mixed outrage with incredulity. The sceptic press couldn't believe Mr Blair had dared escape the box they'd put him in. By promising an assessment, he promises also a decision, yes or no, on a referendum, which they've long reported he was going to dodge. They thought their polls and their power had trapped him into endless prevarication. His lucid statement of the fairly obvious prompted sulphuric rumblings from these victims of his presumption.</p> <p>For sceptics who've kept their heads, it should also provoke alarm. For the electoral equation is changing. Specifying the assessment periodis a way of reclaiming the initiative. As regards Europe, the election looks as though it is going to do a lot more harm than good to the Conservatives. Awareness is dawning among anti-Europeans in and out of the party that, far from validating their belief in the irresistible potency of their cause, the coming contest will probably do the opposite.</p> <p>First, William Hague is going to lose it.

      "bodyText": "When Tony Blair said a week ago that he would assess the economic case for entry into the euro within two years of the election, the only resonance came from the reactions of his enemies. His words weren't a serious departure. Perhaps he didn't know when he would say them, but it was always his plan to say something soon. To wait until the brink of the campaign to declare what was meant by the sheltering mantra \"early in the next parliament\" would have been politically crazy. Knowing he would be dogged for an answer, he needed to supply it before the question became a focus of obsessive and sceptical attention. The response, though, mixed outrage with incredulity. The sceptic press couldn't believe Mr Blair had dared escape the box they'd put him in. By promising an assessment, he promises also a decision, yes or no, on a referendum, which they've long reported he was going to dodge. They thought their polls and their power had trapped him into endless prevarication. His lucid statement of the fairly obvious prompted sulphuric rumblings from these victims of his presumption. For sceptics who've kept their heads, it should also provoke alarm. For the electoral equation is changing. Specifying the assessment periodis a way of reclaiming the initiative. As regards Europe, the election looks as though it is going to do a lot more harm than good to the Conservatives. Awareness is dawning among anti-Europeans in and out of the party that, far from validating their belief in the irresistible potency of their cause, the coming contest will probably do the opposite. First, William Hague is going to lose it. The margin could be large, and it might be massive. Though Hague is said to be the only man alive who doesn't believe this, he doesn't always talk that way. His very response to Blair's statement spoke triumphantly about the pound now being on the verge of death, as if to prove the point he'd always made about the covert iniquity of Labour's secret agenda.

The dreadful dimensions of this plague brutally expose the growing inequality of health provision across the globe. Aids is a death sentence in Africa, whilst in Britain a cocktail of drugs can manage the disease. What is true of Aids is also true of many other less high-profile diseases, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis. As the human genome discoveries launch us into a new era of customised medicine in the developed world, this gulf in provision will only yawn wider. Right at the heart of it lies the issue of how access to essential medicines is now regulated and patented under the trade related intellectual property agreement (Trips) enforced by the World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>Here, there is grave cause for concern. On Monday we reported the lawsuit brought by 42 pharmaceutical companies against the South African government for its interpretation of Trips on the importing of cheap copies (known as generics) of Aids medicines. This is an outrageous scandal. Other instances in Ghana and Uganda of Glaxo Smith- Kline's bullying over importing generic drugs for Aids are equally shocking. The US is taking Brazil to the WTO disputes procedure, alleging that it is flouting Trips in producing a generic copy of AZT drugs, which cost a mere $3,000 a year, instead of the $15,000 charged in the US. But the cheaper drug enables 60,000 Aids sufferers in Brazil to receive free treatment.</p> <p>Patents are necessary and important to reward innovation. In few other industries is this so crucial, given the high risks of developing medicines for the market - as the pharmaceutical industry justifiably points out. But there is a trade-off between the benefits of a patent system and human well-being. This was clearly understood in the negotiations for Trips. Two provisions were included to safeguard the latter - compulsory licensing and parallel importing of generic drugs in the case of a national emergency. But the wording of these vital provisions was left dangerously vague and countries such as South Africa are struggling to find the international intellectual property lawyers to prove their case that they have a national emergency. Equally disturbing is the way the US government blatantly disregards Trips when it chooses. There are now 16 countries being threatened by the notorious \"301\" legislative clause under which the US can impose trade sanctions without going through the WTO. All the disputes involve drug patenting. The reason for this aggression on the part of the US government is not difficult to discern. The pharmaceutical industry, as we reported earlier this week, is a powerful operator within the Washington establishment. In just two years, members of the US pharmaceutical association spent a staggering $236m on lobbyists and and a further $14m went to political parties. This is likely to get still worse under a Bush administration, which includes several members with close links to the drug companies.</p> <p>In their defence, the companies point to examples of corporate philanthropy and there are some good examples, such as Merck's pledge to fight river blindness. But while philanthropy has an important role, the bigger picture must be reform - a shortening of patents in developing countries, a strengthening of the Trips provisions and a greater sense of responsibility from the drug companies. Without such measures, there is a real danger of a public backlash. We expect the highest ethical standards from drug companies because their business is the lives and deaths of human beings; we expect consideration for the well-being of all human beings to temper their drive for profit. Over the last few days, there has been disturbing evidence from Argentina to Britain that this is far from the case. A handful of drug companies now dominate the global health industry, which is among the most profitable industrial sectors, and yet they insist that patent laws cannot be tailored for the needs of desperately poor countries where millions will die. What the drug companies potentially face is a public relations disaster. Jean -Pierre Garnier, the president of Glaxo SmithKline, pointed out on our pages yesterday that drug companies cannot solve the problem of global poverty. True.

      "body": "<p>The phenomenal success of Hotmail, Napster and the instant messaging service, ICQ has proved how companies can attract new users much faster through the internet than they can using traditional off-line advertising. What is less clear is exactly how such rapid, word-of-mouth growth is achieved. </p> <p>In an attempt to explain this unique ability of the internet to accelerate interest in a product, venture capitalist Steve Jurveston coined the term 'viral marketing' in a 1997 Netscape newsletter. </p> <p>Jurvetson, who helped to finance the free email service Hotmail, had clearly witnessed the power of viral marketing at close range. By Christmas 1996, within a year of its launch, Hotmail had 10m registered users. At that time, such phenomenal growth had not occurred anywhere else in media history. </p> <p>Furthermore, this unprecedented performance had been achieved with a marketing budget of just $50,000 (needless to say, this was before Microsoft bought the company). Hotmail's fast-track success was not the result of an extensive advertising campaign, either online or offline. Instead, it has been attributed to a decision made by another Hotmail seed investor, Tim Draper. </p> <p>Draper was adamant that every email sent by a Hotmail user should incorporate the following message: \"Get your free Web based email at Hotmail\". By clicking on this line of text, the recipient would be transported to the Hotmail home page. While this message would not have had much effect at the foot of an email sent by the company itself, when sent by a friend or relative it made an impact, confirming Marshall McLuhan's belief that the medium validates the message. The very act of sending a Hotmail message constituted an endorsement of the product and so the current customer was selling to future customers just by communicating with them. The recipients of a Hotmail message learnt not only that the product works, but also that their friend is a user. </p> <p>Jurveston now believes that a viral marketing component must be built into the DNA of every internet company in order for it to succeed. \"I can't think of any dot.com that I'd consider that doesn't come with a viral marketing element,\" he says. Jurveston also cites Metcalfe's Law to illustrate the viral effect of word of mouth on the net. </p> <p>According to Metcalfe's Law, the value of a network increases as the square of the number of users connected to it. This law of increasing returns evidently applies to viral marketing in a way that it does not apply to offline word of mouth publicity. This is because, for better or worse, people are more connected in cyberspace than they are in the real world. As Seth Godin writes in his e-book, Unleashing the Ideavirus: \"With word of mouse you can tell 100 friends, or 1,000 friends. Because the numbers are larger and faster than they are offline, the virus grows instead of slows.\" (See <a href=\"http://www.ideavirus.com\">www.ideavirus.com</a>) </p> <p>While the most vocal proponents of viral marketing are to be found in the US, over the past year many companies in the UK have been successfully adopting viral techniques. Last summer, for instance, Thomas Cook, generated 250,000 new customers through its Weekend Breaks email marketing campaign, while rival travel operator Lastminute.com achieved similar results with its PDA-based Euro 2000 campaign. </p> <p>Islay Malt, which makes Laphroaig malt whisky, used a viral marketing campaign to boost awareness of the brand in the run up to Christmas. Four different e-Christmas cards were distributed to 7,000 UK members of Friends of Laphroaig. According to the company, more than 40% of those who received the email (which incorporated a link to the selection of e-cards) went on to send a personalised copy to a friend. Michelle Pitts, brand director of Laphroaig, claims that the recipients \"loved this distinctive approach, with almost 1,000 sending a card to a friend within three hours of the email being sent out\". </p> <p>While these examples involve using deliberate direct marketing tactics in order to encourage recipients to pass on a marketing message to others, other companies take a more organic approach. For UK-based gambling site Flutter.com, which has built an online community on the concept of person-to-person betting, viral marketing occurs naturally and therefore needs little encouragement. </p> <p>Websites enabling consumers to engage with each other clearly have a head start when it comes to generating recommendations. (This explains why the only dot.com to have received more consumer-to-consumer referrals than Hotmail is file-swapping music site Napster.) </p> <p>It is important to remember, however, that word-of-mouth can travel in two directions. Although many people find the term 'viral marketing' offensive, it not only suits the infectious nature of network enhanced word of mouth, but also conjures up its negative potential. </p> <p>By losing control of the marketing message, companies are at the mercy of online opinion. If customers have a bad experience of a certain product, word can spread at alarming speed. As The Cluetrain Manifesto states: \"The networked market knows more than companies do about their own products. And whether the news is good or bad, they tell everyone.\" </p> <p>This is not to say that viral marketing should be discouraged. Indeed, viral marketing occurs whether a company wants it to or not - via email, Usenet discussion groups, consumer opinion sites such as E-pinions.com, and other interactive forums. </p> <p>The only way companies can limit viral marketing's negative capacity is, paradoxically, by openly embracing it. By making it easy for conversations between customers to occur, companies will be satisfying the internet user's primary objective: to interact with other people. </p> <p>\"It's imperative to stop marketing at people,\" says Godin. \"The idea is to create an environment where consumers will market to each other.\" </p> <p>This view is supported by John Owrid, a management partner at UK direct marketing agency Ogilvy One, which opened a virtual marketing unit last August.\"As the net's infrastructure gets stronger, viral marketing gets easier and the rewards for those who can do it properly, get bigger,\" he says. </p> <p>Viral marketing therefore completely reverses standard promotional methods such as TV advertising and web banners. Instead of excluding the customer from the creation of a marketing message, once initiated, viral marketing cuts the role of the company to that of a passive bystander. Ultimately, this has a democratising effect on the whole marketing process. </p> <p>\"One of the beautiful things about viral marketing is that all these mechanisms only work when you're talking about a good product,\" says Emanuel Rosen, author of The Anatomy of Buzz. </p> <p>However, for companies with confidence in their product, viral marketing can prove more effective than web banners and interruptive forms of advertising. By drawing the customer into the selling process, companies are not only stretching their marketing budgets further, but are also acknowledging the way in which the net has radically redefined the notion of marketing itself.</p>",

It has lost out to its rival, ZD Net's GameSpot, which CNet acquired along with the Ziff Davis publishing empire. The zine's last issue includes the games of the year for 2000 with comments from GamerX (\"but don't worry - he wrote them before he found out he'd been fired\"). Staff who had been anonymous are finally given credits with each brief bio being followed by a shopper-friendly \"Add to your cart\" symbol. Group therapy British video game developers have formed TIGA, The Independent Games Developers Association (the D is silent). The aim is to share opinions on things like mobile gaming, and to co-ordinate actions, such as lobbying for government support. Smashing Virtua Tennis is already one of the best games on the Sega Dreamcast, and the sequel will pack a much bigger promotional punch: Venus and Serena Williams have signed up to endorse it. The game is expected to appear in November. The inferior competition includes Anna Kournikova Smash Court Tennis on the Sony PlayStation. Martina Hingis, who recently beat both Williams sisters, remains without a videogame to her name.",

      "body": "<p>It wasn't meant to be like this. By now computers were supposed to have turned us into a bunch of geeks, so used to huddling over our screens we could barely communicate with only our anoraks for comfort. Instead, people have subverted new technology and used it to find more and more ways to share saucy jokes and expand their network of friends. </p> <p>There has been a huge boom in the use of email and text messaging. Last month a Guardian/ICM poll found text messaging had taken off astonishingly quickly since it was introduced in 1992, with 43% of adults using it, and 76% of all 18 to 24 year olds. Email use is proving just as popular a tool. Like most such phenomena, the attraction might not be initially clear but you soon get sucked in. </p> <p>Alice Thompson, 23, is a fan of both. She is known as the Text Queen to her friends and says she sends between five and 10 messages a day. There's a certain tribalism in the way she uses it to rally friends for a night out, sending out a clarion call to meet. </p> <p>\"My friends and I take our phones out with us and send messages to other friends saying, 'We're in this club and it's really good. Come and meet us',\" she said. \"It means we don't have to spend ages planning a night out. You can send the same message to everyone.\" </p> <p>It is also a great tool for relieving office boredom, in the human resources department of the company where she works, by sharing secret messages and passing jokes along the cyber grapevine. Alice has found text messaging has given a fillip to her flirting skills too. </p> <p>\"If there is a guy I like I find it easier to send text messages rather than phone him up,\" she said. \"I just banter with them and forward funny jokes. Because we're not face to face I can be cheeky and a bit abusive! </p> <p>\"There is one guy, and I did not know him that well, but we've started to text message each other and that's how we communicate. He is a friend of a friend and I would never have phoned him up but this way it's not intimidating. </p> <p>\"It's just a bit of flirting. I have met him for a drink a few times but we have probably kept the friendship going through text messaging.\" </p> <p>There are other benefits. Messaging help Alice keep in touch with old school friends she would probably have lost contact with if it wasn't so easy to send a message saying \"Hi, thinking of you\" rather than having to compose a long letter. All her friends have text message-friendly phones and at work Alice uses email and internet site <a href=\"http://www.boltblue.com\">www.boltblue.com</a> through which you can send text messages too. </p> <p>It seems these new forms of communication have filled a gap, offering something that face to face conversation does not. After research into how people use new technology, psychologist Professor Pam Briggs, of the University of Northumbria, believes people have embraced them because they offer a chance to present yourself the way that you want to and be a bit more playful. </p> <p>\"Some say workplace email depersonalises and can aggravate relationships between colleagues. Some companies advise managers only to use it to pass on basic factual information because more personal instructions can be misinterpreted,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The trouble is, this does not fit well with the way people use it. People seem to really enjoy text messaging and emailing their friends and colleagues. They can take their time shaping their message and play with it more, pasting in jokes and little bits of video clips and so on. </p> <p>\"People have gone on to text messaging rather than using the one-to-one communication of speaking on the phone to each other. That is partly because you can choose when you want to respond to someone. </p> <p>\"It's a new form of communication that is fundamentally different from anything you can have face to face.\" </p> <p>The fact email and text messaging are both short and quick is a big part of the attraction. Many people find them more informal than making a phone call or writing a letter, and so simpler to use. </p> <p>Tony Bayham, who works shifts at a printers, found it hard to meet new people after his divorce but is convinced an email chat-up is easier and more fun than any other. He met his partner Kathy Hammond on the net, through the dating agency DatingDirect. com, and they courted by email before meeting up. </p> <p>Both had joined the agency around the same time last summer and submitted a profile to be pinned up on the website. Tony read Kathy's and found that they were both divorced with children and keen to get out of the house more. Eager to find out more, Tony sent an email entitled Romance and asked her to look at his profile on the site and email back. </p> <p>She wrote back within hours, told him about her family and clerical job and asked about his. In their first few emails they discovered they both lived in Swindon, had mutual friends and went to the same school. Then they swapped surnames and realised they used to hang around together when they were teenagers, and only lived a mile apart. </p> <p>A few emails later, Kathy gave Tony her phone number and they sat up talking until late at night. They met up two days later, last July, and have been together ever since. Tony said it helped that they could bat their cyber chat back and forth quickly, rather than having to rely on snail mail. </p> <p>\"Things moved quickly because we could exchange so much information so fast,\" Tony said. \"In email, especially for a man, you can say things that you wouldn't say face to face. I told her I was looking for a partner and wrote about what sort of relationship I wanted. If you are face to face you see a reaction in someone and it can put you off. </p> <p>\"We emailed each other two or three times a day when we started off. It was general chat but also some serious stuff about our divorces and children.\" </p> <p>Their email relationship turned conventional dating rules on their head. They shared a lot of personal information about past loves before they even thought to describe each other. Many of their romantic interchanges, then and now, were just routine chitchat they could have been exchanging over the breakfast table. The nice difference was that getting these messages at work showed how much they were thinking of each other even when apart. </p> <p>\"Now we text each other and send emails all the time. Sometimes we text each other every five minutes. Other days, we might just send a couple of messages,\" Tony said. </p> <p>\"It starts off with a 'Good morning and what's work like?', then 'What are you doing later?', 'What do you fancy for tea?', 'Shall I bring a bottle of wine?'. Then just gossip about people at work. I also get jokes sent to me by Kathy and her dirty-minded friends so I've sent text messages back to them before I've met them too. </p> <p>\"We email each other too and I've kept a lot of the ones I've had from Kathy. They're special to me,\" Tony said. </p> <p>Most people see little difference in using email or text messaging, though easily portable mobiles are used far more outside of work. </p> <p>Annabelle Rose, who teaches at a London sixth form college, uses email and text messaging to keep in touch with her pupils. They often email or text her with queries about their work. It helps break down hierarchies. </p> <p>\"It is easier for them to approach me that way, whereas they might be nervous about interrupting me in my office,\" she said. \"With teenagers there is that whole thing about confidence so they find it easier to contact me by text messaging. It's sometimes like a form of half communication, where they text message me to pave the way for a full conversation. </p> <p>\"I have always given my number out to students and said to call me if they have any problems. But no one ever did until text messaging started taking off a couple of years ago. </p> <p>\"They have developed their own lingo as well, which can be a bit of a problem as they have started using these abbreviations in their normal writing, like writing 'tomoro' for tomorrow. </p> <p>\"But they are always polite. If I text them back answering their queries they always send another message saying 'Thanks', even though it's not really necessary. </p> <p>\"I like email because it has helped me to keep in touch with other teachers, too. There aren't many sociology teachers in sixth forms so when a few of us met up at a conference I helped set up a network so we could email each other with new resources. Text and email are the best tools I have found for keeping in touch.\" </p> <p>With an ear to the cyber grapevine, programme makers have caught on too. Text messaging forms the basis of a new show on MTV which began earlier this month (February 5) called Videoclash, in which viewers can use text messaging to vote for their choice of video. Makers of the interactive show say 10 acts a day will go head-to-head, maybe reflecting musical rivalries like Oasis's Liam Gallagher and Robbie Williams, or battles to land the number one slot. </p> <p>And all the figures suggest it is here to stay. More than 70m text messages are sent each month in the UK and the number is rising ten-fold each year. The heaviest users are people under 24 who often send 10 messages every day and rarely use their mobile phones to make a phone call. There are even plans for a text-only handset. </p> <p>It helps that it is cheap, at around 8p a go, and remarkably trendy in a way mobile phones were never expected to be. Even Zoe Ball says she loves to text. Britney Spears gave email a similar boost with reports she used it to woo Prince William. </p> <p>Computers and mobile phones are fast becoming must-have gadgets for children. And all because it is passe to pass secret notes in class when you can send them through cyberspace. </p> <p> <strong> Portals step in to give mobile users a voice in the wider world of the web</strong><br> In the dizzying world of new technology, brands can still become successful and well known in a fraction of the usual time, often relying largely on word of mouth to advertise. It has only taken seven months for Boltblue to claim to be the largest mobile portal in the UK with more than 2m registered users. </p> <p>The site, at <a href=\"http://www.boltblue.com\">www.boltblue.com</a>, offers free email and text messaging across all mobile networks. Users only pay their normal text messaging charge. The company also offers news, weather, travel and entertainment services.

      "body": "<p>Since the start of February, all of the UK's cellular networks have started charging each other three pence for inter-network SMS text messages. </p> <p>While these charges will roughly cancel each other out in respect of text messages sent by the mobile networks' own subscribers, it spells doom for the wealth of web portals that offer free internet-to-SMS text messaging services. </p> <p>Already, <a href=\"http://www.smsboy.com\">SMS Boy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.totalise.net\">Totalise</a> have closed their web-to-SMS services, and other web portals are weighing their options. </p> <p>You can't blame the networks, as the success of SMS text messaging has caught them unawares, with around 70 million messages being handled in the UK every month. Originally, SMS text messages were a useful extra source of revenue for the suppliers, using spare capacity on the network. </p> <p>The sheer volume of messages, however, has placed a heavy load on the networks, which are already strained at peak times because of significant volumes of voice calls. </p> <p>Coupled with the need to spend extra money on SMS computer centres to handle all this text messaging traffic, the inter-network charge is a logical way of slowing down the growth of SMS messages. </p> <p>Consumers do not have to knuckle down and pay the 10p per message that the networks charge for mobile-originated SMS, rather than use the freebie web portal services. </p> <p>For one thing, non-UK web portals continue to exist and will allow UK- bound text messages, since most of them do not pay the 3p text messaging charge to the UK networks. </p> <p>This is because only a few European cellular carriers have agreed with BT Cellnet, One 2 One, Orange and Vodafone to pay the inter-network SMS charges on UK-bound text messages. </p> <p>Secondly, if your organisation sends a lot of text messages, you can talk to <a href=\"http://www.xtempus.com\">Xtempus</a>, the first of a new breed of text messaging intermediaries to send high volume two-way messages across Europe easily and cost-effectively. </p> <p>Xtempus's service for high volume text messaging is already operational in the UK, and will be rolled out in France, Germany, Spain and Italy within the next few months. </p> <p>For humbler SMS text messengers, web portals that can still be used include the <a href=\"http://www.lycos.co.uk\">Lycos</a> service, as well as foreign portals in <a href=\"http://www.bru-noc.net/sms_login.html\" target=\"_new\">Belgium</a> and <a href=\"http://www.2sms.ch\">Switzerland</a>.

      "bodyText": "Since the start of February, all of the UK's cellular networks have started charging each other three pence for inter-network SMS text messages. While these charges will roughly cancel each other out in respect of text messages sent by the mobile networks' own subscribers, it spells doom for the wealth of web portals that offer free internet-to-SMS text messaging services. Already, SMS Boy and Totalise have closed their web-to-SMS services, and other web portals are weighing their options. You can't blame the networks, as the success of SMS text messaging has caught them unawares, with around 70 million messages being handled in the UK every month. Originally, SMS text messages were a useful extra source of revenue for the suppliers, using spare capacity on the network. The sheer volume of messages, however, has placed a heavy load on the networks, which are already strained at peak times because of significant volumes of voice calls. Coupled with the need to spend extra money on SMS computer centres to handle all this text messaging traffic, the inter-network charge is a logical way of slowing down the growth of SMS messages. Consumers do not have to knuckle down and pay the 10p per message that the networks charge for mobile-originated SMS, rather than use the freebie web portal services. For one thing, non-UK web portals continue to exist and will allow UK- bound text messages, since most of them do not pay the 3p text messaging charge to the UK networks. This is because only a few European cellular carriers have agreed with BT Cellnet, One 2 One, Orange and Vodafone to pay the inter-network SMS charges on UK-bound text messages. Secondly, if your organisation sends a lot of text messages, you can talk to Xtempus, the first of a new breed of text messaging intermediaries to send high volume two-way messages across Europe easily and cost-effectively. Xtempus's service for high volume text messaging is already operational in the UK, and will be rolled out in France, Germany, Spain and Italy within the next few months. For humbler SMS text messengers, web portals that can still be used include the Lycos service, as well as foreign portals in Belgium and Switzerland. The Swiss service operates on a pay-to-use basis with modest fees. Free web-to-SMS services come and go with surprising regularity.

Israeli intelligence (the domestic security agency known by its Hebrew acronym Shabak) held Ayad responsible for a failed mortar attack on a Jewish settlement in Gaza earlier this week and for a plot to kidnap senior Israeli military officials. The public acceptance of the killing of the Palestinian officer is based on the fact that he was involved in attacks against Jews and served as an officer in Yasser Arafat's security apparatus. He was also a ringleader in an underground cell of Hizbullah, the virulent anti-Israeli, Lebanese Shi'ite movement sponsored by Iran. Hizbullah has recently made inroads into Palestinian areas to incite Arabs to step up the battle against Israel. Ayad and the eight Israelis who died in yesterday's attack are the latest casualties of the intifada, which has already claimed the lives of more then 60 Israelis and 350 Palestinians. At least 12 of the Palestinians were killed in what is called the \"liquidation\" policy of Israel. This is government approval of action against a \"wanted\" list of Palestinians accused by Israeli intelligence of guerrilla warfare or planning terrorist attacks. In other words this is a policy of \"shoot on sight\". The intelligence and the army special forces that carry out the operations prefer to kill during a battle, thus giving the impression of military action and not a mafia-style execution. Yet, the aims justify the means and sometimes they will sacrifice niceties for efficiency and the achievement of the designated goal. Many international critics bash Israel for this policy, claiming that it is not in accordance with international law and democratic values. But there is nothing new in Israel's readiness to adopt controversial methods. In the course of more than 30 years Israel has from time to time resorted to assassination of Palestinians and other Arabs suspected of terrorism. The liquidation policy is intended to disrupt operational plans, prevent the implementation of terrorist attacks and deter others from attempting to carry out such attacks. In rare cases - such as the 1995 assassination in Malta of Fathi Shkaki, the leader of Islamic Jihad - does the killing of the senior commander bring about the paralysis of the organisation. However, in most cases the true motivation is to do with domestic policy rather than operational considerations.

Supporters of this policy claim that \"surgical\" operations are better then an all-out assault on civilians and urban centres that would result in thousands of casualties.

Researchers claim Samson demonstrated six of the seven recognised traits associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), including impulsiveness, recklessness and getting into fights. The Californian psychologists point out that Samson routinely fought: he once killed 1,000 Philistines single-handedly with a donkey's jawbone. He also showed a reckless disregard for his safety when he told Delilah - who had tried to kill him three times - the secret of his strength. The Bible tells how Samson lost his powers when Delilah cut off his hair. He was enslaved by the Philistines before his hair regrew and returned his strength, allowing him to pull down their temple. Samson also burned Philistine fields, demonstrating both impulsiveness and an inability to conform to social norms. He was deceitful and, like many people with ASPD, he behaved badly as a child, causing fires and bullying other children. Eric Altschuler, of the University of California at San Diego, told New Scientist: \"It's almost as if the writer of the story has the [ASPD] criteria tacked to the wall and he is writing a sketch. But this was 3,000 years ago.\"",

He and his team are using two of the most commonly wasted biomass sources as their starting materials for making polymer foams and composite materi als, that might be used in countless consumer products. The first unlikely material they are using is coffee grounds. Several million tons a year are produced as the by-product of making instant coffee, which are simply dumped.

Then, they simply add coffee grounds, some activating agent and a catalyst, and the materials bind together to form a tough and durable composite material. If they carry out a similar reaction scheme but missing out the coffee grounds ingredient, they end up with a new version of flexible polyurethane foam.

In the US, the efforts of Brian Seiler and his colleagues at Eastman Chemical in Kingsport, Tennessee, have taken inspiration from some of the earliest plastics and brought them right up to date. Before synthetic polymers, such as nylon and PVC, were invented there was cellulose. Cellulose is a natural polymer composed of thousands of sugar molecules strung together forming the fibrous parts of plants and trees. A century ago, it was used as the raw material for making semi-natural plastics, such as celluloid, famous as the transparent \"film\" of movie fame. Today, cellulose is still commonly used to make the materials for cigarette filters, suit linings and specialist photographic films. While the family of esters of cellulose with carboxylic acids ('cellulose esters') has been known for more than 100 years, the family continues to grow, as does its influence, says Seiler. </p> <p>But Seiler and his colleagues did not want to make simple celluloid, they wanted a high- tech polymer that could be made from waste cellulose. The manufacture of synthetic polymers generally relies on building up the long polymer chain from chemical units called monomers. Seiler and his team reasoned that they could start with the natural cellulose polymer and simply modify it using chemistry to endow it with new physical properties. </p> <p>He and his colleagues have now developed a variation on the cellulose polymer for use in car body finishes. The material, called carboxy methylcellulose acetate butyrate, can be dispersed in water, so it does away with the need for a toxic organic solvent. Moreover, it not only dries faster but also helps the paint form a much smoother, shinier finish. </p> <p>Food and wood waste too are finding application in making new polymers. Nobuo Shiraishi of Kyoto University is working on methods of converting one of the biggest sources of biomass waste - wood shavings and food industry waste, such as potato and other vegetable scraps - into plastics. He and his team have developed techniques to produce both thermoset and mouldable plastics from biomass. They can make thermoset plastics, for instance, by gently heating their biomass starting material with alcoholic organic compounds with sulphuric or phosphoric acid for just an hour or two. </p> <p>The team has already made materials with what Shiraishi describes as \"fine plasticities, physical properties and biodegradability\". The resulting plastics could be used as glues, foams, and mouldings for less environmentally damaging packaging and consumer products from TV cases to mobile phone covers. </p> <p>In a similar vein, Shiraishi and his colleagues are also looking at how recycled newspaper, magazine, and box paper might be used as a cheap source of cellulose.

In New Zealand, possums introduced from Australia occupy 95% of the country and have reached densities 20 times higher than in their native country.

      "bodyText": "Conservationists face two rather different and challenging problems: how to stop animals breeding and how to encourage them to breed. The planet has experienced five major extinctions so far and is in the grip of a sixth, human-induced one which is wiping out thousands of species. At the same time, some species, particularly those introduced into other countries, are increasing exponentially, damaging the environment and upsetting ecosystems. In New Zealand, possums introduced from Australia occupy 95% of the country and have reached densities 20 times higher than in their native country. Damage and the costs of culling them amounts to $50 million dollars a year; they are fed two and a half tons of poison annually. Non-pest species such as koalas can also be a problem. In some areas they breed so rapidly they eat every eucalyptus leaf in sight and then die of starvation. Cuddly creatures, referred to by conservationists as \"icons\", do elicit more sympathy than mice and rats, but in New Zealand killing possums is seen as not only inhumane, but a threat to humans, since the toxin is sprayed from planes and can enter the water system.

These include a digital voice recorder, currency converter and Microsoft Outlook-compatible address and calendar storage. Other facilities include a Wap browser, seven games, and voice command and dialling. Talk time is rated at four hours, with standby around 170 hours.

However, the key to success will be assessing which ones people are likely to use and which are likely to be consigned to the technology trash can. But one thing is certain: when the real family moves into the home in April, Orange should be in a much better position to predict the future than the Tomorrow's World research teams were back in the 1960s.",

The rest were soldiers. \"I saw a lot of body parts,\" said Moshe Sarussi, a soldier, aged 19, from Ashqelon, who was treated for shock. \"I saw a leg split in two, and a stomach split wide open. I saw a lot of bad things.\"</p> <p>Three women soldiers were fighting for their lives last night in a Tel Aviv hospital. At the scene, rescue workers scrubbed away evidence of the carnage within two hours, hosing the pavement and collecting body parts in plastic bags.</p> <p>After plunging his bus into the crowd, who were on their way to jobs at an army base south of Tel Aviv, Mr Olbeh swerved back on to the road, leading police in a 20km chase through thick traffic until he smashed into a truck. He was also shot and was operated on yesterday for injuries to his pelvis and legs.</p> <p>It was the deadliest single attack inside Israel in nearly four years. Officials said yesterday that the Middle East had embarked on a dangerous new era. That realisation was dawning in Washington as well, where President George Bush called on both sides to halt the escalation in violence that started with last week's landslide election victory by the hardliner, Ariel Sharon.</p> <p>But Mr Sharon, who swept to power promising to restore Israelis' sense of security, was unyielding. \"Once again it has been proven that from the Palestinians' standpoint, there is no difference between Netzarim (in the Gaza Strip), the West Bank, the Lebanese border, and the country's very heart,\" he said.</p> <p>After facing international condemnation for the bombing of Palestinian cities, imposing a blockade in the West Bank and Gaza that has devastated the local economy, and assassinating leaders of Mr Arafat's Fatah movement - two within the last 24 hours - Israel yesterday appeared to be running out of options to contain the uprising.</p> <p>\"We are facing the most difficult day Israel has had in the last four or five years,\" Israel's most senior diplomat, Alon Liel, told reporters. \"In addition to the tragedy, we are shocked by the appalling reaction of Yasser Arafat and his senior ministers, justifying it and putting the blame on Israel.\"</p> <p>On a visit to Turkey, Mr Arafat described yesterday's attack as a road accident. \"What is happening is an Israeli military escalation that has direct consequences on the feelings of the Palestinian people.\"</p> <p>It was widely expected that the outrage could spur efforts to forge a national unity government between Mr Sharon and the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, that would feel even more justified in meting out reprisals on the Palestinians.</p> <p>Yesterday's attack happened just before 8am local time when the pavement near the Azur junction was packed with soldiers making their way to work. Avi Nager, who was riding his motorcycle behind the bus, said: \"I saw him slowing down and all of a sudden he began speeding like crazy. He must have been going 80km an hour.\"</p> <p>Scores of protesters descended on the junction yesterday, screaming \"Death to Arabs\" and carrying placards reading: \"Sharon, keep your promise\" and exhorting anyone who would listen that the time had come for Israeli to assassinate Mr Arafat, and the leading figures in his administration.</p> <p>Only a few showed restraint. \"Many people are in shock,\" said Shuki Ziv, who returned to the bus stop to search for his soldier son, whom he had dropped off a few minutes before the attack. His son was unhurt. \"But I am sorry to say we are getting used to it. The Palestinians don't want us here, and we don't want them, but we have no other choice than to negotiate.\"</p> <p>There appeared no chance of that yesterday with Israel sealing off the Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank, and closing the sole border crossing into Gaza. Last night, Mr Barak summoned his security cabinet to weigh up Israel's response. But even as the orders went down, some of Mr Barak's ministers were questioning the wisdom of tightening the ring of steel around Palestinian enclaves in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which has reduced a population to ruin. \"I don't think it is in our favour to keep the Gaza Strip tightly closed with the people starving inside,\" the deputy defence minister, Efraim Sneh, said.</p> <p>In a sign of the deepening divisions on how to deal with the Palestinian uprising, Mr Barak's security adviser, Danny Yatom, threatened to strike a mortal blow at Mr Arafat's administration. \"If the Palestinian Authority does not straighten itself out, we will need to take steps that could very badly hurt the Palestinian Authority itself, to the point of bringing about its collapse. Would this improve the Palestinians' lot? Under no circumstances,\" he said .</p> <p>But there was also a deep sense of vulnerability, as Israel's police chief admitted that no security regime could stop a lone operator like Mr Olbeh. \"I want to stress that despite all the warnings and the precautions and deployments and all the operations by all the security forces, there is no way to prevent an incident like this 100%,\" said Israel's police chief, Shalom Aharonishky.</p> <p>In Gaza City, relatives of Mr Olbeh said he had no links to any political organisation and dismissed competing claims for the attack from the militant group Hamas, and a previously unknown Palestinian group. Instead, they described him as a man driven out of his senses by Israel's economic blockade and by the escalation of violence in the southern Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Yesterday was Mr Olbeh's first day at work after a layoff of several days. His brother said he had spent his time brooding over reports of shot and wounded children in two nights of clashes at the Khan Yunis refugee camp. He was also worried that he could no longer earn enough for his family.</p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0213goldenberg.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Ariel Sharon's landslide victory has led to a heightening of tension (3mins 53)</a><br></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,437762,00.html\">14.02.2001: Israel kills Arafat's man</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,437654,00.html\">14.02.2001, leader: The US pulls back</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,437475,00.html\">13.02.2001: Israel kills 'militant' as coalition talks continue</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,437527,00.html\">13.02.2001, press review: 'We do not expect Sharon to be merciful to our children'</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">The Israeli prime minister's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english/ts.exe?tsurl=0.32.0.0.0\" target=\"_new\">Israeli prime minister's site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www3.haaretz.co.il/eng/htmls/1_1.htm\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz Daily</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

It would appear they included a number of business figures. The ABC television news website has published a photo of some of the visitors and is asking people to contact them if they recognise them. Since the end of the cold war, there have been growing fears in the US navy that there would be a reduction in the number of its submarines. For this reason, it has had a policy of allowing \"opinion formers\", including leading business people, politicians and journalists, to travel on the submarines, sometimes staying overnight, to learn how they work. The trip last week that ended in tragedy was one such outing. The navy investigation is being closely watched in Japan, where there has been fury in the Japanese parliament over the actions of the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who chose to play golf rather than respond immediately to the country's worst maritime disaster in recent years. With anger rising, the issue threatens the administration of the gaffe-prone prime minister, who was forced to fend off calls for his resignation yesterday. Mr Mori, already one of the most unpopular prime ministers since the war, was lambasted for continuing to play golf for two hours after hearing of the accident. The prime minister was on the 15th hole of the Totsuka country club in Yokohama, when he was informed of the news on Saturday. \"I couldn't just stop at that point,\" he explained later. \"I would have held up the other parties playing behind us.\" Senior figures in the ruling Liberal Democratic party said Mr Mori was making the party into a \"national laughing stock\".

Shocked environmentalists said it was a victory for the chemicals industry, which had resisted curbs on products unless there was conclusive proof they damaged health. The commission claimed in a statement that the white paper was a step forward in protecting the public from 30,000 chemicals routinely released untested into the environment in everyday products, such as plastic and car upholstery. At a long and acrimonious meeting in Strasbourg, the commission's environment directorate was forced to give way to the industry's lobby, which feared loss of jobs and competitiveness if everyday chemicals had to be tested. The paper goes to a meeting of EU environment ministers on March 8, where it can be changed or rejected before going to the European parliament and emerging as a directive. Chemicals which environment groups most worry about, those that accumulate in body fat and can pass to the next generation via the placenta or the egg, are specifically excluded from controls unless harm can be demonstrated; such chemicals are also passed on in breast milk, when children are at their most vulnerable. An example is pentabromodiphenyl ether, used to make car upholstery soft, which has doubled as a trace element in breast milk every five years since the 1970s.

      "body": "<p> Probably the biggest collection of unwanted files on a Windows 95/98/Me PC is the one in the Temporary Internet Files folder. These files are useful, of course: when you go \"back\" in Explorer, it is quicker to get the page from this cache than to fetch it again from the remote server. It is therefore a good idea to keep about 100 to 150 megabytes of space for internet files. But it is not a bad idea to clear them out once in a while, as part of a spring cleaning routine. </p> <p>There are two Microsoft-approved ways to empty the cache. The first is to run Disk Cleanup, the utility found in Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools in Windows 98/Me. (This utility also empties the Recycle Bin and the Temporary Files folder.) The more common way is to run Internet Explorer, select Tools| Options, and click the button marked Delete Files.

      "bodyText": "Probably the biggest collection of unwanted files on a Windows 95/98/Me PC is the one in the Temporary Internet Files folder. These files are useful, of course: when you go \"back\" in Explorer, it is quicker to get the page from this cache than to fetch it again from the remote server. It is therefore a good idea to keep about 100 to 150 megabytes of space for internet files. But it is not a bad idea to clear them out once in a while, as part of a spring cleaning routine. There are two Microsoft-approved ways to empty the cache. The first is to run Disk Cleanup, the utility found in Start|Programs|Accessories|System Tools in Windows 98/Me. (This utility also empties the Recycle Bin and the Temporary Files folder.) The more common way is to run Internet Explorer, select Tools| Options, and click the button marked Delete Files.

      "body": "<p>Is it possible to make a profit on the internet? It has been if you are a lawyer or a telecommunications giant or even a trendy design house. But is it possible to make a profit if you are a dot.com selling goods or services direct to the consumer? </p> <p>The received wisdom is no. So far, most dot.coms have yet to break even. But despite a daily barrage of stories detailing news of yet another dot.com collapse, there are a few UK companies that are turning a tidy profit selling goods and services direct to the consumer. And most of them have never asked for a penny of venture capital. </p> <p>According to sources like NetValue and the Post Office, British shoppers are taking to the internet like never before. Record sales were recorded this Christmas - with as many as between five and six million of us buying goods over the net by November, over a third more than the year before. </p> <p>But January has also seen a record number of dot.coms falter. Some have already filed for bankruptcy, while others are rapidly being bought up by \"old economy\" companies. For the UK's online community, these are proving to be hard times. </p> <p>One reason might be that there are simply too many of them. The high street has room for only a couple of major pharmacists: the online community is served by seven. Which all leads to too little money spread among too many hands and confidence in dot.coms at rock bottom. But just because so many management consultants, venture capitalists and private investors got it so fabulously wrong doesn't mean the business-to-consumer (B2C) model is irrevocably flawed. </p> <p>If you start small, grow organically and resist the temptation to blitz the market with expensive ad campaigns, then making a profit from selling goods and services to the consumer is still possible. </p> <p>And turning a buck on the net doesn't mean you have to be very small. CNN Interactive has been in the black since launch, while Conde Naste recently announced that its raft of internet properties is already breaking even. And let us not forget that pornographers and online casino owners have been making bucketloads of cash selling their wares direct to the consumer. </p> <p>Just as the new economy received far, far too much hype, perhaps now it is buckling from an equally distorting amount of pessimism. Somewhere in the middle is a healthy dose of reality. </p> <p>The following six stories come from companies that claim to make a profit online. Each tale has a moral, and all of them suggest there might be gold in them there hills after all. </p> <p><strong> Mail order works</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.hdfr.com \">Hard to find records</a> <br> \"It used to be that we were quiet in the summer and winter was just mental. Now it's just mental all the time,\" says Lora Nash, head of online sales at HTFR.com (Hard To Find Records) - a rare vinyl specialist in Birmingham. </p> <p>Run out of a 2,000 sq ft warehouse, HTFR's online catalogue of rare and deleted vinyl contains over 47,000 titles. The company buys up old record collections, catalogues them and sells them either through the superstore or on the net. Online sales now amount to nearly 90% of the company's total sales. </p> <p>The company says it is making a profit on the internet because it was already making a profit before it went online. Hard to Find Records was formed as a mail-order business by Jason Kirby, a former computer programmer, in his bedroom in 1991. The firm went online in 1995. </p> <p>What started as little more than a hobby is today a multi-million pound business employing 35 people. It is entirely self-funded and has grown out of its profits. \"We've got such a specialised business,\" says Nash. \"A lot of people have tried to follow us, bit we did it first and that gives us one hell of a reputation.\" </p> <p><strong> Do everything in-house</strong><br> <strong> The Alternative Gift Company </strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.alt-gifts.com \">www.alt-gifts.com</a> <br> Its turnover may be no greater than a couple of country craft shops, but one small company in Banbury, Oxfordshire, is proving that selling goods on the net can be profitable. The Alternative Gift Company sells unusual gifts, like plots of the moon, direct to the consumer. The company has a core staff of five and hires more to cover the busiest periods, around Christmas and Valentine's day. \"I think our business model makes us profitable at the end of the day,\" says Jonathan Aylmer of Alternative Gifts. \"We are very careful with what we spend and do everything in house. </p> <p>\"We design and build our own website and we undertake our own fulfilment. We can operate a next day delivery service because they stock everything on the premises.\" </p> <p>Doing things in-house means that a company like Alternative Gifts can keep its costs down. \"A lot of dot.coms have had massive advertising budgets, which I feel is a kamikaze attitude,\" says Aylmer, who sold his furniture business to fund the company. </p> <p>But Aylmer also claims that the company's pragmatic approach to business extends even further. \"We have no fantasy titles here,\" he insists. \"No project managers or online developers. Nothing that can demand huge salaries which no online business, in my opinion, can support at this time.\" </p> <p><strong> Go for the slow buck</strong><br> <strong> Jobserve.com</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.jobserve.com \">www.jobserve.com</a> <br> Tucked away in the sleepy Essex village of Tiptree lies one dot.com with one of the fastest growing profit margins in the UK. Ten miles out of Colchester lies Jobserve, a kind of virtual labour exchange for IT workers. </p> <p>Jobserve is a bustling medium-sized company employing 70 people. It was formed in 1993 by Robbie Cowling, a former IT contractor, and a business partner. The pair invested \u00a32,000 of their own money and have never received any outside investment. </p> <p>The company went in to profit within the first couple of months and has funded its growth through its takings. Last year Cowling bought his partner out. </p> <p>\"I saw no reason for us to go for funding,\" says Cowling. \"The plans we have got in the way of growth we can afford to do ourselves. So we didn't want to give up any of our share. And we've never fancied floating.\" </p> <p>Last year the company found itself at the top of the ProfitTrack list of fastest growing companies not listed on the stock market. </p> <p>\"A lot of people were getting in to it just because they thought that they could do that, float it and get out,\" claims Cowling. </p> <p>\"But they are not living and breathing what they are doing. If we'd have taken that sort of attitude we wouldn't be here today.\" </p> <p><strong> Find a niche market</strong><br> <strong> Med4u.co.uk</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.med4u.co.uk \">www.med4u.co.uk</a> <br> Despite so many of their contemporaries falling by the wayside, there are still start-ups out there looking for venture capital. Some like <a href=\"http://www.med4U.co.uk\">www.med4U.co.uk</a> are even making a modest profit. </p> <p>Med4U.co.uk is an online medical consulting service. The company has recruited a panel of 20 doctors and it offers medical consultation via email. For this it charges a \u00a325 consultancy fee and most customers get a response within 48 hours. </p> <p>A company like Med4U makes a small operating profit, partly because its two founders are paying themselves a reduced salary and the overheads are low because they are working from home. The company receives between 30 and 40 customers a week and nearly 80% of them are men. </p> <p>\"We think that men are far more reticent to take time off work or bother to consult their GPs,\" says Graham Boyd, who formed the company along with business partner Dr Liz Miller. </p> <p>The company also found most of those men also happen to be gay, so last month, it launched <a href=\"http://www.GayMed4U.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.GayMed4U.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>\"In London it is perhaps easier for a gay man to find friendly GPs. It's less easy if you are out in the sticks,\" says Boyd. </p> <p><strong> Run a traditional business</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.findaproperty.com \">www.findaproperty.com</a> <br> \"In a sense we are just a traditional business. We've always felt that the fact that we are on the internet is really irrelevant,\" says Michael O'Flynn of FindaProperty.co.uk. </p> <p>The company advertises properties on the internet, for which it charges \u00a329.

      "bodyText": "Is it possible to make a profit on the internet? It has been if you are a lawyer or a telecommunications giant or even a trendy design house. But is it possible to make a profit if you are a dot.com selling goods or services direct to the consumer? The received wisdom is no. So far, most dot.coms have yet to break even. But despite a daily barrage of stories detailing news of yet another dot.com collapse, there are a few UK companies that are turning a tidy profit selling goods and services direct to the consumer. And most of them have never asked for a penny of venture capital. According to sources like NetValue and the Post Office, British shoppers are taking to the internet like never before. Record sales were recorded this Christmas - with as many as between five and six million of us buying goods over the net by November, over a third more than the year before. But January has also seen a record number of dot.coms falter. Some have already filed for bankruptcy, while others are rapidly being bought up by \"old economy\" companies. For the UK's online community, these are proving to be hard times. One reason might be that there are simply too many of them. The high street has room for only a couple of major pharmacists: the online community is served by seven. Which all leads to too little money spread among too many hands and confidence in dot.coms at rock bottom. But just because so many management consultants, venture capitalists and private investors got it so fabulously wrong doesn't mean the business-to-consumer (B2C) model is irrevocably flawed. If you start small, grow organically and resist the temptation to blitz the market with expensive ad campaigns, then making a profit from selling goods and services to the consumer is still possible. And turning a buck on the net doesn't mean you have to be very small. CNN Interactive has been in the black since launch, while Conde Naste recently announced that its raft of internet properties is already breaking even. And let us not forget that pornographers and online casino owners have been making bucketloads of cash selling their wares direct to the consumer. Just as the new economy received far, far too much hype, perhaps now it is buckling from an equally distorting amount of pessimism. Somewhere in the middle is a healthy dose of reality. The following six stories come from companies that claim to make a profit online. Each tale has a moral, and all of them suggest there might be gold in them there hills after all. Mail order works Hard to find records \"It used to be that we were quiet in the summer and winter was just mental. Now it's just mental all the time,\" says Lora Nash, head of online sales at HTFR.com (Hard To Find Records) - a rare vinyl specialist in Birmingham. Run out of a 2,000 sq ft warehouse, HTFR's online catalogue of rare and deleted vinyl contains over 47,000 titles. The company buys up old record collections, catalogues them and sells them either through the superstore or on the net. Online sales now amount to nearly 90% of the company's total sales. The company says it is making a profit on the internet because it was already making a profit before it went online. Hard to Find Records was formed as a mail-order business by Jason Kirby, a former computer programmer, in his bedroom in 1991. The firm went online in 1995. What started as little more than a hobby is today a multi-million pound business employing 35 people. It is entirely self-funded and has grown out of its profits. \"We've got such a specialised business,\" says Nash. \"A lot of people have tried to follow us, bit we did it first and that gives us one hell of a reputation.\" Do everything in-house The Alternative Gift Company www.alt-gifts.com Its turnover may be no greater than a couple of country craft shops, but one small company in Banbury, Oxfordshire, is proving that selling goods on the net can be profitable. The Alternative Gift Company sells unusual gifts, like plots of the moon, direct to the consumer. The company has a core staff of five and hires more to cover the busiest periods, around Christmas and Valentine's day. \"I think our business model makes us profitable at the end of the day,\" says Jonathan Aylmer of Alternative Gifts. \"We are very careful with what we spend and do everything in house. \"We design and build our own website and we undertake our own fulfilment. We can operate a next day delivery service because they stock everything on the premises.\" Doing things in-house means that a company like Alternative Gifts can keep its costs down. \"A lot of dot.coms have had massive advertising budgets, which I feel is a kamikaze attitude,\" says Aylmer, who sold his furniture business to fund the company. But Aylmer also claims that the company's pragmatic approach to business extends even further. \"We have no fantasy titles here,\" he insists. \"No project managers or online developers. Nothing that can demand huge salaries which no online business, in my opinion, can support at this time.\" Go for the slow buck Jobserve.com www.jobserve.com Tucked away in the sleepy Essex village of Tiptree lies one dot.com with one of the fastest growing profit margins in the UK. Ten miles out of Colchester lies Jobserve, a kind of virtual labour exchange for IT workers. Jobserve is a bustling medium-sized company employing 70 people. It was formed in 1993 by Robbie Cowling, a former IT contractor, and a business partner. The pair invested \u00a32,000 of their own money and have never received any outside investment. The company went in to profit within the first couple of months and has funded its growth through its takings. Last year Cowling bought his partner out. \"I saw no reason for us to go for funding,\" says Cowling. \"The plans we have got in the way of growth we can afford to do ourselves. So we didn't want to give up any of our share. And we've never fancied floating.\" Last year the company found itself at the top of the ProfitTrack list of fastest growing companies not listed on the stock market. \"A lot of people were getting in to it just because they thought that they could do that, float it and get out,\" claims Cowling. \"But they are not living and breathing what they are doing. If we'd have taken that sort of attitude we wouldn't be here today.\" Find a niche market Med4u.co.uk www.med4u.co.uk Despite so many of their contemporaries falling by the wayside, there are still start-ups out there looking for venture capital. Some like www.med4U.co.uk are even making a modest profit. Med4U.co.uk is an online medical consulting service. The company has recruited a panel of 20 doctors and it offers medical consultation via email. For this it charges a \u00a325 consultancy fee and most customers get a response within 48 hours. A company like Med4U makes a small operating profit, partly because its two founders are paying themselves a reduced salary and the overheads are low because they are working from home. The company receives between 30 and 40 customers a week and nearly 80% of them are men. \"We think that men are far more reticent to take time off work or bother to consult their GPs,\" says Graham Boyd, who formed the company along with business partner Dr Liz Miller. The company also found most of those men also happen to be gay, so last month, it launched www.GayMed4U.co.uk. \"In London it is perhaps easier for a gay man to find friendly GPs. It's less easy if you are out in the sticks,\" says Boyd. Run a traditional business www.findaproperty.com \"In a sense we are just a traditional business. We've always felt that the fact that we are on the internet is really irrelevant,\" says Michael O'Flynn of FindaProperty.co.uk. The company advertises properties on the internet, for which it charges \u00a329. One reason why the company has been successful is that it chose to specialise in the south-east of England, rather than go national. Just like a traditional estate agent. O'Flynn insists that the company attracted most of its customers through word-of-mouth. It hasn't spent money on massive ad campaigns although it does advertise in local newspapers. FindaProperty, which is based in Brighton, decided not to go for any venture capital. \"We felt that there was a degree of unreality about the kind of money that was being thrown around last year says O'Flynn.\" Use outside investment Vavo.com While new media wannabies pile-up by the wayside, one site catering for silver surfers is already making money on the net. Vavo.com is a lifestyle portal for the over 45s. The company makes money principally through the sale of insurance, but profitability has also been helped by sales of banner advertising. The company tipped over into the black after a healthy Christmas. Vavo insists it has been experiencing steady growth since launch. \"We haven't gone out aggressively with a high profile marketing plan and he haven't got a big ad spend,\" says Oliver Needham, the site's head of public relations. Unlike the other dot.com success stories, Vavo has received outside investment. The company received \u00a32m from an undisclosed private investor in 1999 and received a second round \u00a310 million private placement led by GE Insurance Holdings and the Prudential. It claims to be making an \"operating profit\" with \"the vast majority\" of its investment capital safely tucked away in the bank. So why has Vavo done so well when so many have faltered? \"A lot of the recent dot.com start-ups thought that it was better to being first instead of be simply better,\" says Needham. \"We didn't go that route.\"",

By throwing in a stampede of footnotes without assessing whether they are interesting or not - and including some pointless stand-up material which, one assumes, is supposed to advance the narrative but simply slows it down - Position Impossible is effectively a bloated three-part documentary with a sleeker two-hour effort trapped inside it. </p> <p>We're told that only one fifth of the Kama Sutra is actually about sex, while the other four-fifths are about gymnastics, dressing, interior design, eating and playing tunes on glasses filled with different amounts of water. So after these diversions, you can understand why people mainly concentrate on the one fifth that's about sex. It's a lot more interesting. </p> <p>A fine example of this is Burton's story about a friend (probably himself) who was shocked when, while making love to his Indian mistress, she caught a mosquito between her toes. It could have been a lot worse, but even with the emphasis on toes, it's a whole lot more captivating than How To Be An Effective Courtier. And this being the case, one suspects the Kama Sutra won't be turning up on the next series of Living By The Book. </p> <p>Tiptoeing along the fine line between sensitive concern and smirksome voyeurism - and rarely tipping into the latter - <strong> Embarrassing Illnesses</strong> (Channel 4) concluded with a programme on stammering. With no apparent cause or cure, stammering affects some 450,000 adults in the UK and, of those, Rob and Sean were seen doing their best to come to terms with their affliction. </p> <p>Rob had been trapped inside a world of words since he went to school and realised he talked differently from other children. He had problems when buying things, going to the bank and making phone calls. Shop assistants, he continued, sometimes walked away from him, mid-sentence. This latter example notwithstanding (shop assistants are trained to behave in such surly ways to everyone and not just stammerers), Rob had had enough and learnt how to \"costal breathe\" at a workshop. Initially, this meant wearing a belt round his chest - not a good look - but by the time he was ordering nine Chicken McNuggets, he was just fine and beltless. Bless. </p> <p>Sean, meanwhile, had been sent out to ask people in Covent Garden if they knew anyone with a stammer. Again, this seemed unfair since one assumes, rightly or wrongly, that anyone approaching you in Covent Garden is to be ignored. But Sean did surprisingly well.

The chancellor has already lined up a clutch of new benefits to impress voters when they come into force on April 1 and his \u00a310bn projected budget surplus will give him scope to add a few more goodies at the last minute without frightening City sentiment. Downing Street last night backed away from an apparent hint from Tony Blair at prime minister's question time that the current pensioners' winter fuel allowance of \u00a3200 will be maintained or increased, instead of being put back to \u00a3150 as basic pension rates rise by \u00a35 a week for a single person, and \u00a38 for a couple on April 1. \"Future spending decisions are a matter for future budgets,\" No 10 said.

Yesterday's publication of a 1.8% inflation rate for January, combined with the prospect of unemployment falling below 1m for the first time since 1975 underlines how well the chancellor has succeeded in realigning the political and economic cycles. Even average earnings, rising at 4.4%, will boost the feel-good factor and not cause immediate alarm, and this week's more optimistic predictions for the troubled US economy ease another potential worry for Mr Brown and Mr Blair. With the tempo of quasi-campaigning increasing by the day Mr Blair will combine an upbeat emphasis on Labour's plans to reform key public services in a second term with a negative drumbeat against the Tories' \"boom and bust\" reputation in general and William Hague's opportunistic policy-making style in particular. The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, yesterday gave another foretaste of Labour tactics when he taunted Mr Hague with figures from the opposition's own experts that suggest the cost of his plans to privatise state pensions for the under-30s would be \u00a35bn in the first year, rising to \u00a315bn a year or more. Mr Hague remains adamant that, like Edward Heath in 1970, he can surprise the pollsters and snatch victory as a strong Tory turnout - galvanised by such issues as asylum, crime and \"save the pound\" - combines with Labour apathy to confound Mr Blair. \"I do believe we will win.

Double-digit share price falls were common across the tech world with Imagination Technologies dropping 14p to 145.5p, Orchestream slipping 20p to 186p and Fibernet falling 70p to 760p. At least software group Autonomy, down 65p at \u00a315.68, provided some amusement. Early in the session a mystery trader mistakenly placed an order for 500m Autonomy shares on the stock exchange's electronic trading system, Sets. The order, said to be the largest in the history of the stock exchange, was quickly cancelled. One had to look hard but there were some bright spots. Insurance outfit Royal &amp; Sun Alliance advanced 17p to 531p on the back of \"buy\" advice from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, while rival Prudential gained 40p to \u00a310.50 on Tuesday's cost-cutting plan. Logistics group Exel was also in demand, rising 18p to 958p after an upgrade from HSBC Securities. The FTSE Mid 250 slipped 27.5 points to 6,747.5, with electronics firm Volex Group taking the title of worst performer, down 332.5p at \u00a312.82 after a shock profits warning. Even further down the corporate ladder, Mayflower, the bus builder and truck body group, was marked 12.5p lower at 85.5p after full-year figures fell short of expectations. But water company Mid-Kent Holdings climbed 17.5p to 480p. Dealers reckon a 550p cash offer is on the way.",

Legacy is pinning its hopes on the involvement of the developer Teesland overcoming fears expressed by English Partnerships, a government agency, that the bid was flawed and few companies would sign up for space in the dome.

In the first overhaul of parliamentary allowances for five years, the independent Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB) is considering recommending increasing MPs' office allowances of \u00a351,572 a-year. A decision is not due until the start of next month, but the board's chairman, Sir Michael Perry, is believed to be sympathetic after hearing evidence from inner-city MPs who spend more time on asylum seekers than on their voting constituents. Some politicians fear MPs may be forced from parliament by a combination of working 100-hour weeks and dipping into their own pockets to fund extra staff. Pressure for an increase has come from the likes of Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman and MP for Southwark North and Bermondsey, who last year spent \u00a325,000 of his \u00a348,371 salary to pay for an extra employee and who estimates a third of his constituency time is spent on asylum work. Labour's Karen Buck, MP for Regents Park and Kensington North, said: \"I have 500 letters, emails and phone calls a week - up to a half of which will deal with asylum seekers. \"My asylum caseload and that of other colleagues would easily outweigh the total case load of hundreds of other MPs.\" But Tory David Wilshire, whose Spelthorne constituency covers Heathrow, denied he needed extra funding. \"I have a huge problem ... but that doesn't mean I'm going to demand an extra member of staff.

      "body": "<p>The pianist, composer and producer Moses Taiwa Molelekwa, who has been found hanged at the age of 27 next to the body of his wife, Florence, was the brightest hope for a renaissance of South Africa's jazz culture. During the 1990s, his synthesis of African and western idioms, both traditional and contemporary, offered a brave new vision of the Rainbow Nation.</p> <p>The two albums he released were heralded in the west as cutting edge and also earned him South African Music Awards. Despite his limited recording career, he was acknowledged in South Africa as a \"modern great\". He had recently widened his range by producing some of the hottest stars of kwaito music - the new, urban groove which melds garage, ragga and hip-hop with the ambience of township jive.</p> <p>Molelekwa was born in Tembia township outside Johannesburg, growing up among what he described as \"the lost generation\". Both his father and grandfather were musicians, and Moses was introduced to jazz through his father's collection of John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis records. He started playing guitar and Casio keyboard before studying piano on Saturdays at the Federated Union of Black Arts Academy. \"There is no question that music saved my life,\" he said later.</p> <p>When he graduated in 1987, with a diploma and best student award, he was already working at Kippie's nightclub, where he accompanied internationally-renowned artists including Miriam Makeba and Jonas Gwangwa.</p> <p>In 1988, he joined Hugh Masekela's band and later toured the US with Dorothy Masuka and Julian Bahula. He founded two bands, Brotherhood and Umbongo, in which he played simultaneously and which alternately won awards in 1991 and 1992. He also worked on theatre productions and film soundtracks.</p> <p>In 1994, Robert Trunz, owner of the Melt2000 label, invited him to join other progressive South African musicians for the Outernational Meltdown compilation, to celebrate the diversity and hope of the new South Africa. His first album, Finding Oneself (1995), announced the arrival of a serious innovator in South Africa's ongoing relationship with jazz, continuing the path opened up by Abdulla Ibrahim. The album won two South African Music Awards, for best traditional and best contemporary jazz, and was highly praised in Europe.</p> <p>Molelekwa then spent more than a year recording his second album, Genes And Spirits, of which he said: \"I wanted both to reach a wider audience and experiment more.\" He succeeded on both counts; his musical versatility, eclectic repertoire and suave presentation helped define the new cool. With guests such as the Brazilian singer Flora Purim, Cuban pianist Chuco Valdes and Cameroonian funk drummer Wassy Brice, this CD was less obviously South African, incorporating reggae and drum 'n' bass along with world music input.</p> <p>Genes And Spirits won Molelekwa another South African Music Award, while the high production values of Trunz's label and the slick marketing made the music internationally accessible. He played at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, and at the North Sea Jazz Festival in two consecutive years. In 2000, he toured Britain with Joanna MacGregor. Sales of the Genes And Spirits CD have just started to take off in the US, where the video is being shown on cable TV stations.</p> <p>Robert Trunz described Molelekwa as \"an extremely talented musician, a very delicate and sensitive person\". He had virtually completed a third album of solo piano numbers for MELT2000 and was gigging with a line-up of younger musicians.</p> <p>He had also spread his attentions from jazz to the more commercial and frenetic kwaito scene.

      "bodyText": "The pianist, composer and producer Moses Taiwa Molelekwa, who has been found hanged at the age of 27 next to the body of his wife, Florence, was the brightest hope for a renaissance of South Africa's jazz culture. During the 1990s, his synthesis of African and western idioms, both traditional and contemporary, offered a brave new vision of the Rainbow Nation. The two albums he released were heralded in the west as cutting edge and also earned him South African Music Awards. Despite his limited recording career, he was acknowledged in South Africa as a \"modern great\". He had recently widened his range by producing some of the hottest stars of kwaito music - the new, urban groove which melds garage, ragga and hip-hop with the ambience of township jive. Molelekwa was born in Tembia township outside Johannesburg, growing up among what he described as \"the lost generation\". Both his father and grandfather were musicians, and Moses was introduced to jazz through his father's collection of John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis records. He started playing guitar and Casio keyboard before studying piano on Saturdays at the Federated Union of Black Arts Academy. \"There is no question that music saved my life,\" he said later. When he graduated in 1987, with a diploma and best student award, he was already working at Kippie's nightclub, where he accompanied internationally-renowned artists including Miriam Makeba and Jonas Gwangwa. In 1988, he joined Hugh Masekela's band and later toured the US with Dorothy Masuka and Julian Bahula. He founded two bands, Brotherhood and Umbongo, in which he played simultaneously and which alternately won awards in 1991 and 1992. He also worked on theatre productions and film soundtracks. In 1994, Robert Trunz, owner of the Melt2000 label, invited him to join other progressive South African musicians for the Outernational Meltdown compilation, to celebrate the diversity and hope of the new South Africa. His first album, Finding Oneself (1995), announced the arrival of a serious innovator in South Africa's ongoing relationship with jazz, continuing the path opened up by Abdulla Ibrahim. The album won two South African Music Awards, for best traditional and best contemporary jazz, and was highly praised in Europe. Molelekwa then spent more than a year recording his second album, Genes And Spirits, of which he said: \"I wanted both to reach a wider audience and experiment more.\" He succeeded on both counts; his musical versatility, eclectic repertoire and suave presentation helped define the new cool. With guests such as the Brazilian singer Flora Purim, Cuban pianist Chuco Valdes and Cameroonian funk drummer Wassy Brice, this CD was less obviously South African, incorporating reggae and drum 'n' bass along with world music input. Genes And Spirits won Molelekwa another South African Music Award, while the high production values of Trunz's label and the slick marketing made the music internationally accessible. He played at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, and at the North Sea Jazz Festival in two consecutive years. In 2000, he toured Britain with Joanna MacGregor. Sales of the Genes And Spirits CD have just started to take off in the US, where the video is being shown on cable TV stations. Robert Trunz described Molelekwa as \"an extremely talented musician, a very delicate and sensitive person\". He had virtually completed a third album of solo piano numbers for MELT2000 and was gigging with a line-up of younger musicians. He had also spread his attentions from jazz to the more commercial and frenetic kwaito scene. He had started producing other artists, including Sibongie Khumalo and TKZee, the biggest selling kwaito group, and had produced the leader Tokolo's new record for BMG. In recent months colleagues say he had been working and playing too hard. It was known that his marriage was in difficulty. His 35-year-old wife and manager, Florence Mtoba, was also a prominent figure. She had previously managed other musicians, including Busi Mhlongo, and was highly regarded in music and cultural circles. It was in their office in downtown Johannesburg that Moses was found hanging from a beam next to Florence's body. She had reportedly been strangled. They leave an eight-year-old son, Zoe. \u0095 Moses Taiwa Molelekwa, musician, born April 17 1973; died February 13 2001",

I smiled, knowing I would not call as all I would have to say was that it was pure joy. Our son's little Jack was six, his sister Helen four, as was our daughter's Lydia. We saw them all regularly and being a grandmother seemed a huge and wonderful part of my life.</p> <p>That morning I listened to callers describing the pleasures and demands, the learning and frustrations, and from some later callers, the heartache.

How sad to experience such loss, I thought. How lucky I am.</p> <p>The following week, it happened to me. That was a year ago, and we have not seen Jack and Helen since.</p> <p>Derek and I had recently visited our daughter-in-law, Lynn, for a night. At the last minute, our son, Peter, had to go away on business, but he had assured us we would be welcome. It seemed to go well. It was true that the children, clearly missing their dad, were quarrelling more than usual, but we felt encouraged by the fact that Lynn talked to us about it, for she is a reserved person. We emailed Peter, telling him of our happy weekend.</p> <p>The first we knew that anything was wrong was Lynn's phone call some days later. She was angry and resentful: the weekend had been awful; I was critical, interfering; the Toddler Taming book I had offered an insult. She could usually cope when Peter was around; now it was all too much. She made increasingly wild accusations. Unable to resolve things, I put down the phone in a state of shock.</p> <p>We and our son have tried to recover the situation, so far without success. The more Derek and I pressed for a reconciliation, the more strain it put on their marriage. Important though grandparents are in children's lives, we felt that for their parents to be together was their anchor. We have sent birthday and Christmas presents, but that is all.</p> <p>Coping with the loss, the sense of failure and the helplessness, has tested us to the limits. We could not have done it without the support of family and close friends, especially of our daughter. Talking with them has helped me not just to relieve the pain by sharing it, but to seek to make sense of it. I have discovered that tension between mother and daughter-in-law is more common than I had realised. I had not thought of myself as powerful in this sense. My hurt had made me feel a victim, which is a comforting place to be - for a while. But it solves nothing and I have had to do some hard thinking. Offering ideas and supportive advice is one thing with my daughter, who generally finds it useful, and is quite able to tell me when she doesn't. But the relationship with a daughter-in-law is entirely different. We had underestimated the extent to which Lynn felt unable to help us to fit in better with her needs: the pressure built up and the volcano erupted.</p> <p>I only now recognise that I felt I should be the perfect granny. My own grandmother was hugely important to me as I grew up. My daughter loved my mother in much the same way. They were both great role models for me. Perhaps that desire of mine got in the way of my picking up small signs that could have told us all was not well.</p> <p>I am learning instead to be a \"good enough granny\" and I hope this will give everyone more space.

She taught both at Cambridge University and in Africa, and wrote books which looked at agriculture both in this country and the developing world.</p> <p>Her family was closely connected with Cambridge - her father was an academic and her mother was, in 1889, one of the earliest students at Newnham College.

As well as this strong academic background, her family were also associated with agriculture, owning a manor house in Devon and then inheriting a small estate, Hilfield, near Dorchester, in Dorset, where the family spent their holidays.</p> <p>As a child, Edith spent two years in bed following a fall. She recovered, but her hearing had been damaged and she always remained of tiny stature and with a frail constitution. Educated by a governess in her early years and then at Downe House School, near Newbury, she went to Newnham in 1930. Most unusually, for a woman in that era, she read economics. It was an exciting time. She heard Maynard Keynes lecture as he was starting to develop his great theory. He would, she remembered, often return a week later and say, \"I thought again and you should ignore what I said last time.\"</p> <p>She started work at a difficult time. While, even in the depression, men with firsts were sure of a good academic job, it was different for a woman. For three years she worked as a resident scholar at the Ministry of Agriculture: this was the beginning of a lifetime's work in agricultural economics. She then took a job at the Economist. The war was spent first at the Ministry of Food and then in the Cabinet Office civil history department. After the war, she returned to agricultural economics and economic history, this time in the academic world. She then returned to Cambridge as Gilbey lecturer in the history and economics of agriculture, and held this post until 1963.</p> <p>This was when she developed her creative work. Her first major publication, British Farming 1939-1949, came out in 1952. It is a fascinating account of agriculture in Britain at a critical period, when farming switched from a depressed state to playing a major role in feeding the nation.</p> <p>One of her key jobs was to teach agricultural economics on the land economy or agriculture degree courses. Years later, former students would describe how this tiny woman had lectured to a bunch of hulking students. Edith resigned from her Cambridge job in 1963 and shifted her energies to investigating the developing world.</p> <p>Despite her constitution, she accepted a job at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, as visiting professor of economics and later as professor of economics. She was conscious of the need to address the economic issues that were relevant to what were then rural peasant economies.</p> <p>During the 1960s she brought out a number of important books. These included A History of British Agriculture, 1846-1914 (in collaboration with Christabel Orwell). There was also work on development issues; a textbook, The Economics of African Countries, in collaboration with myself; and a book on African marketing systems.</p> <p>In 1966, she was appointed to the executive of the Agricultural Economics Society; in 1971, she was elected president. She continued to research throughout the 1970s, writing the eighth volume of the Cambridge University series Agrarian History of England and Wales (1978).</p> <p>Edith's life was not confined to academia.

Roger Adams, the department's pardon attorney, told the Senate judiciary committee that the White House counsel's office called him at midnight, just hours before Mr Clinton was due to leave office on January 20, and gave him a list of names under consideration for a pardon. Mr Adams claimed the White House told him only that Mr Rich and commodity trader Pincus Green needed further background checks and that both men \"had been living abroad for several years\".

He said that when the FBI confirmed an hour later that Mr Rich was a wanted fugitive he rang an assistant attorney general, Eric Holder, who told him that he knew about the application. Republicans in Congress yesterday appeared to signal that they will hold Mr Holder responsible for the debacle. \"He did not acquit himself or the justice department well in this case,\" said Senator Jon Kyl. \"There is nothing that justified his inaction.\" In his defence, Mr Holder told the committee that \"there are things I wish I could have done differently on that night\" but he was \"extremely busy that day and especially that night\" with other tasks, including the security planning for the imminent inauguration of President Bush.

The company has no influence over Corel's business decisions. </p> <p>\"When we announced our deal with Corel we said it would in no way impact their ability to do software with other platforms.\" </p> <p>A justice department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation but refused to discuss details. \"We are looking at the transaction and the competitive effects,\" she said. </p> <p>President George Bush is expected to announce the appointment of a new antitrust head at the justice department within days. The most likely contender, Charles James, is said to view antitrust abuses more narrowly than his Clinton-appointed predecessor, who signed the Corel investigation. </p> <p>Corel was unavailable for comment yesterday. Microsoft is due to appear before the US court of appeal at the end of this month after last year's ruling that it broke US antitrust laws. The Seattle-based company faces a court order that it should be split into two to prevent its continued dominance of the world's operating systems.</p>",

Microsoft's $135m(\u00a392.6m) investment in Corel, a loss-making Canadian company, which makes rival office software packages, has raised antitrust concerns at the department of justice. Corel was a vocal opponent of Microsoft and a supporter of a rival operating system, Linux, before Microsoft bought its 25% non-voting stake in the company last October. As part of a re-organisation Corel announced plans at the end of last month to spin off its Linux distribution operations, while continuing to develop applications for the system. It would continue to develop software for Microsoft Office, which controls more than 90% of the market for word processing and other office-based services. The Corel revamp appears to have coincided with a justice department decision to serve Microsoft with an order three weeks ago to hand over all internal documents related to the Corel investment. Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft, said the group was co-operating with antitrust officials and that the company expected the deal to proceed. \"We think it's very narrow in terms of the information they have requested,\" he said. The company has no influence over Corel's business decisions. \"When we announced our deal with Corel we said it would in no way impact their ability to do software with other platforms.\" A justice department spokeswoman confirmed the investigation but refused to discuss details. \"We are looking at the transaction and the competitive effects,\" she said. President George Bush is expected to announce the appointment of a new antitrust head at the justice department within days. The most likely contender, Charles James, is said to view antitrust abuses more narrowly than his Clinton-appointed predecessor, who signed the Corel investigation. Corel was unavailable for comment yesterday. Microsoft is due to appear before the US court of appeal at the end of this month after last year's ruling that it broke US antitrust laws. The Seattle-based company faces a court order that it should be split into two to prevent its continued dominance of the world's operating systems.",

The anti-tax cut millionaires are headed by some of America's richest and most famous names, including Warren Buffett, George Soros and Bill Gates Sr, the father of the Microsoft billionaire. The three are among 120 super-wealthy Americans who are backing a drive organised by Mr Gates Sr against Mr Bush's plan to abolish estate (inheritance) taxes that are paid only by the rich. \"Repealing the estate tax would enrich the heirs of America's millionaires and billionaires while hurting families who struggle to make ends meet,\" a petition drafted by Mr Gates Sr states. The billions of dollars in lost government revenue as a result of the plan \"will inevitably be made up either by increasing taxes on those less able to pay or by cutting social security, Medicare, environmental protection and many other government programmes so important to our nation's continued well-being\", it continues. Mr Buffett, America's fourth richest man, told the New York Times that he had not yet signed the petition, but only because it did not go far enough in defending \"the critical role\" of the estate tax.

Backers of the campaign to keep the tax include many other resonant names in American business history, including David Rockefeller and Steven Rockefeller of the oil-based billionaire family. The elder Mr Gates said he had not yet asked his son to sign his petition, but he revealed that the Microsoft founder was \"sympathetic\" to the campaign. The criticism of Mr Bush from his home state of Texas comes from members of the state legislature who are facing the embarrassing fact that Texas is running short of money as a result of the tax cuts Mr Bush introduced during his last year as governor. Just over a year ago, Mr Bush pushed a $1.85bn tax cut programme through the Texas legislature at a time when the state's budget was projected to show a $6.4bn surplus. The tax-cut package formed a central plank in Mr Bush's successful bid to defeat John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination and in his campaign to take the White House from Al Gore in November.

Final resolution of the plan was dependent on the requirements of the franchise holder and other users of the route. </p> <p>The plan was halted on the orders of deputy prime minister John Prescott, who said that the doubling of Railtrack's costs made a rethink imperative. He said that he had asked the SRA to advise him urgently about the sudden rise in costs. </p> <p>Sir Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, said that he did not believe that a \"risky tilt-train solution\" was right for the east coast main line, unlike the west coast route, where tilting trains are due to be introduced next year. It would be a great shame to have to wait another two years to start rebuilding the railway. </p> <p>His comments came as Britain's first tilting train was trialled yesterday on a track near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. </p> <p>It is the first of 55 Pendolino trains built in Italy which will operate between Euston, Manchester and Scotland from May next year.</p>",

He denied that it was the cause of the delay, and said it was still at the pre-feasibility study of costing the upgrade of the east coast line. He said that there could be no definitive plan for the modernisation until Sir Alastair had produced a strategic plan for the route. Final resolution of the plan was dependent on the requirements of the franchise holder and other users of the route. The plan was halted on the orders of deputy prime minister John Prescott, who said that the doubling of Railtrack's costs made a rethink imperative. He said that he had asked the SRA to advise him urgently about the sudden rise in costs. Sir Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, said that he did not believe that a \"risky tilt-train solution\" was right for the east coast main line, unlike the west coast route, where tilting trains are due to be introduced next year. It would be a great shame to have to wait another two years to start rebuilding the railway. His comments came as Britain's first tilting train was trialled yesterday on a track near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. It is the first of 55 Pendolino trains built in Italy which will operate between Euston, Manchester and Scotland from May next year.",

In its latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank admitted that it would undershoot the government's 2.5% inflation target for a total of four years and that there was a chance that price pressures could turn out to be even weaker than it is anticipating. The Bank said that last week's quarter-point reduction in base rates to 5.75% had been a pre-emptive strike, even though it believes that the UK economy is in reasonable shape. However, the Bank added: \"The risks to growth and inflation are presently clearly on the downside, stemming in particular from the risk of a deeper or more prolonged slowdown in the US.\" The report revealed differences of opinion among the nine-strong monetary policy committee over the prospects for inflation, which has been below 2.5% since the spring of 1999 and is not projected to return to that level until 2003. One faction on the committee believes that improvements to Britain's supply-side performance and the darkening global outlook mean that inflation could come in up to 0.5 percentage points lower than the Bank's central projection. Another group is worried about the tightness of the labour market, a concern certain to be exacerbated by yesterday's figures from the office for national statistics showing a larger than expected increase in average earnings and a hefty fall in unemployment.

Nearly 200 skilled staff have been told they will go by the end of the year with the remaining 60 expected to follow by 2005 as the oil and chemicals company switches production to new facilities in Scotland and the north-east of England. BP, which unveiled profits of \u00a39.7bn on Tuesday, is regarded by many as the best employer in a region reeling from steel sector restructuring announced by Corus. The group said it had been engaged in extensive consultation with its staff and where possible would try to avoid redundancies. A BP spokesman said: \"By giving a year's notice we hope this should enable staff to plan their futures.\" He pointed out that BP was engaged in building a gas turbine power plant with General Electric at Baglan Bay. They were creating an energy park around it which should create new jobs. Baglan Bay is the last leading facility BP operates in Wales, having earlier closed its nearby Llandarcy oil refinery. The company first announced in November 1998 its planned withdrawal from ethanol production at Baglan Bay \"early in the 21st century\". But employees not selected to stay with the company said yesterday they were shocked to be told they must leave. One who asked not to be namedsaid: \"These were the premier jobs in south Wales with the average package offering \u00a330,000 a year including share options and non-contributory pension. Where will I find another job like that? Certainly not flipping burgers.\"",

In spite of the notoriety of a handful of high-profile female offenders, the world is not ready for a group of individuals whose crimes undermine the image of woman as natural protector. Such offenders also challenge the dearly-held beliefs that women are incapable of sexual aggression and a penis is a prerequisite to abuse. Thus my answer to the inevitable question (\"What do they do?\") has been the cause of much premature plate-clearing in the years since I began the study.</p> <p>What they do is, for the most part, what men do, though many fewer of them do it. Estimates based on the work of investigators in Britain and the US indicate that women account for around 10% of child molesters - slightly higher if boys are the victims, lower if girls are. Yet research into women who abuse is sparse.</p> <p>In the absence of reliable information, attempts to explain why so few women are convicted of sex crimes rely on cultural myths: that women's \"natural\" passivity precludes their involvement in sexually aggressive acts or that their innate cunning allows them to engage in such acts and evade detection. Rather than take part in fruitless speculation, I wanted to study those female offenders whose existence is undeniable: the tiny group of women in England and Wales serving sentences for sex offences. The Home Office doesn't count female sex offenders as a separate category, but I discovered 18 in prison. To put this in perspective, there are currently 5,000 men in jail for sex offences.</p> <p>In a three-year study, I gathered information on 30 women - not all of them in prison - whose offences ranged from indecent photography to sexual murder. At the less serious end of the spectrum were women like Rita and Betty, whose offences were, respectively, failure to protect children from an abusive father and allowing indecent photos to be taken of a minor. For Betty, a 60-year-old childminder who had, she said, been \"conned\" by her male co-offender, conviction constituted a bewildering misunderstanding of her role in the exploitation of a five-year-old. In Rita's case, a failure to act on her daughters' disclosures of abuse by their father led, 15 years later, to her imprisonment on a charge of cruelty.</p> <p>So what can such a study teach us? As individuals, the women challenged some stereotypes and fulfilled others. For many feminists, Rita and Betty's offences indicate a cultural bias that holds women responsible for the sexual behaviour of men. Neither played an active role in the offences, nor were they considered by professionals to have a sexual interest in their victims. So their offences do not require us to rethink our conception of women as passive in sexual behaviour in general and sex crime in particular.</p> <p>Not all the women were Ritas and Bettys, however. Four were serving life sentences for offences culminating in murder; others were women who had sexually abused children independently of men, or played leading roles in group offences. Among them were a woman charged with offences against a consenting 15-year-old boy and a 50-year-old factory worker convicted of sexually assaulting her granddaughter. Clearly such women do not fit the popular stereotype of the sexually obsessed, socially inadequate - male - paedophile. But neither were they the coerced accomplices of predatory men.</p> <p>For the most part, the women do not see themselves as offenders of any kind. The reason lies in wider social attitudes towards sex offenders on the one hand and women offenders on the other. The depth of public feeling against paedophile sex offenders reveals itself in the response to single, tragic incidents, such as the murder last year of Sarah Payne, with the demands for something to be done about the \"monsters in our midst\". Yet this focus on a minority of obsessive, predatory male strangers acts as a smokescreen not only for the much larger number of men who abuse their own children but also for women. It allows even those found guilty to deny that they are sex offenders and to be supported in this by professionals whose training and experience leads them to see women as victims rather than perpetrators of sexual crime.</p> <p>Take Kimberly, a 20-year-old convicted of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl she suspected was sleeping with her partner. Though she admitted her crime, Kimberly denied it made her a sex offender. \"What does my head in is when people think I'm a pervert, going round with little kids and things. I'm not saying it was right what I did, but it wasn't that I just saw this girl and took a fancy to her.\"</p> <p>Similarly Susan, convicted of aiding and abetting the rape of her daughter, says: \"I don't have any inclination for little children; I'm not one of those people. I mean, I brought five up.\"</p> <p>Many of the women claim they were coerced or tricked into taking part in sex offences - and some case files corroborate this - but others seem unable to conceive of themselves as involved, even where there was no question of force being used.Julie, convicted with her partner of indecently assaulting two 12-year-old girls, admits to being present, but no more. \"I mean, I was just there. I should have left; even the police said if I'd left I'd only have been charged with knowing about it, not doing it.\"</p> <p>Several women claimed they had \"done nothing\" and their denials, like Julie's, seem to have been accepted, even encouraged, by police officers, psychologists and prison staff. In prison, this may reflect a concern for the women's safety because they are seldom segregated, as men are. One woman bullied by other prisoners says an officer advised her to \"deny it to their faces and it'll soon blow over\".</p> <p>This cultural inability to acknowledge women as \"real\" sex offenders may stop them developing a sense of responsibility for their crimes. On the contrary, their own experience of violence, together with the rhetoric of therapy, often leads them to see themselves as fellow victims. Thus Clare explains how her partner, a known paedophile, took advantage of her: \"He was kind to me; he probably got me at a vulnerable point, when I was under a lot of depression, a lot of pressure. He bought me jewellery, a car, so the way I look back at it now, because I've had counselling, I think he used me: he took my vulnerability and he used it to get what he wanted.\"</p> <p>The point is not that Clare is wrong to claim she was \"used\" but that current policy and practice is geared around the male offender. No one knows how much of a risk women like Clare pose to children in the future, nor does her complicated story fit easily into the stereotype of women offenders as pathetic inadequates or mythically evil, \"unnatural\" individuals. While professionals have decades of research on which to base judgments about male sex offenders, decisions about women are made in the absence of relevant information.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the police and probation service are left with difficult decisions to make regarding the risk posed by individual offenders. On whom would you target resources: the father of three who abused his step-daughter while her mother was working the night shift; the \"loner\" who divided his day between downloading child porn and hovering around the school playground; or the woman who held down her daughter while her father penetrated her anally? You decide. Or you may choose to confine yourself to less distasteful topics. Pass the peanuts.</p> <p>&amp;#`49; Dr Amanda Matravers is a lecturer in criminology at the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge.</p>",

He bought me jewellery, a car, so the way I look back at it now, because I've had counselling, I think he used me: he took my vulnerability and he used it to get what he wanted.\" The point is not that Clare is wrong to claim she was \"used\" but that current policy and practice is geared around the male offender. No one knows how much of a risk women like Clare pose to children in the future, nor does her complicated story fit easily into the stereotype of women offenders as pathetic inadequates or mythically evil, \"unnatural\" individuals. While professionals have decades of research on which to base judgments about male sex offenders, decisions about women are made in the absence of relevant information. Meanwhile, the police and probation service are left with difficult decisions to make regarding the risk posed by individual offenders. On whom would you target resources: the father of three who abused his step-daughter while her mother was working the night shift; the \"loner\" who divided his day between downloading child porn and hovering around the school playground; or the woman who held down her daughter while her father penetrated her anally? You decide. Or you may choose to confine yourself to less distasteful topics. Pass the peanuts. &amp;#`49; Dr Amanda Matravers is a lecturer in criminology at the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge.",

      "body": "<p>Glyndebourne opera in Brooklyn ought to have a discordant feel to it, but in fact it doesn't. Certainly on a dark, cold evening in February the Atlantic Avenue subway station feels a world away from July in the Sussex downs, and so it is. If you are expecting picnic hampers and tuxedos, then you have got on the wrong train. But if you are expecting the artistic standards one has come to associate with Glyndebourne, then the Brooklyn Academy of Music is a good place to be. </p> <p>A lot of Americans come over to Glyndebourne each summer. But until now Glyndebourne has not crossed the Atlantic in the other direction. Last Sunday, however, Sir George Christie and his festival opera took their widely admired production of Janacek's The Makropoulos Case to Brooklyn and delivered what the New York Times critic Anthony Tommasini rightly described as \"a riveting evening of musical drama\". </p> <p>If this expensive touring visit had been primarily an opportunity for rich Americans to get a slice of the social side of Glyndebourne, then it would not have come to Brooklyn, says Joe Melillo, the executive producer at the place that everyone round here calls simply BAM. </p> <p>\"There's no snob appeal in Brooklyn,\" Melillo says. \"That's not what this is about at all. We have no green pastures and no cattle here,\" he says, gesturing out of the window at an unremitting New York cityscape. </p> <p>\"I'm on the same playing field as Glyndebourne in terms of progressive opera. I am in awe of that achievement. That's the bit of Glyndebourne we're interested in. And in that respect we are the perfect partner.\" </p> <p>Melillo presides over what he says is America's oldest continually operating performing arts institution. In one way or another, BAM has been here since Abraham Lincoln's time. What makes it important, though, is not its age but its vibrancy. Melillo's arts complex in the increasingly trendy Fort Greene district has been central to the revitalisation of this New York borough. </p> <p>Across the East river, the gleaming towers of Manhattan house some of the citadels of the arts and cultural world, including the Lincoln Center, Broadway, and a succession of peerless art galleries. But BAMprospers simply by being different, by having a creative edge and a global outlook that increasingly gives the unfashionable district an artistic feel that is more akin to Paris or Berlin than to corporate America. </p> <p>\"I programme artistic work that aims not to duplicate what audiences can experience in Manhattan,\" Melillo says. \"It's not difficult to get here, but you have to give people a reason to come and that's what I do.\" </p> <p>Glyndebourne's visit comes in the context of BAM's extraordinary 20-year record of enticing some of the most interesting theatrical talents in the world. BAM is where the Royal Shakespeare Company comes every two years. It's where Robert Wilson works with Lou Reed and Philip Glass. It's where Peter Brook's work is performed, in a nearby theatre remodelled to feel like Brook's Th\u00e9tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. It's where Ingmar Bergman will bring Strindberg later this year. It's where Jonathan Miller will revive his staging of the St Matthew Passion. </p> <p>In this framework, the arrival of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's production of Makropoulos makes good sense. Lehnhoff himself agrees. As he sips tea in his Brooklyn hotel, the German director says that bringing this show to New York is a completely different exercise from reviving the standard international \"shared production\" on which so many opera houses now rely, not least to share costs. </p> <p>\"The impetus of the Glyndebourne working conditions remains when we present this work elsewhere,\" Lehnhoff says. \"The impetus comes from the fact that it's not just the singers, but some of the stage crew who have come over, so the Glyndebourne mark is always present.

      "bodyText": "Glyndebourne opera in Brooklyn ought to have a discordant feel to it, but in fact it doesn't. Certainly on a dark, cold evening in February the Atlantic Avenue subway station feels a world away from July in the Sussex downs, and so it is. If you are expecting picnic hampers and tuxedos, then you have got on the wrong train. But if you are expecting the artistic standards one has come to associate with Glyndebourne, then the Brooklyn Academy of Music is a good place to be. A lot of Americans come over to Glyndebourne each summer. But until now Glyndebourne has not crossed the Atlantic in the other direction. Last Sunday, however, Sir George Christie and his festival opera took their widely admired production of Janacek's The Makropoulos Case to Brooklyn and delivered what the New York Times critic Anthony Tommasini rightly described as \"a riveting evening of musical drama\". If this expensive touring visit had been primarily an opportunity for rich Americans to get a slice of the social side of Glyndebourne, then it would not have come to Brooklyn, says Joe Melillo, the executive producer at the place that everyone round here calls simply BAM. \"There's no snob appeal in Brooklyn,\" Melillo says. \"That's not what this is about at all. We have no green pastures and no cattle here,\" he says, gesturing out of the window at an unremitting New York cityscape. \"I'm on the same playing field as Glyndebourne in terms of progressive opera. I am in awe of that achievement. That's the bit of Glyndebourne we're interested in. And in that respect we are the perfect partner.\" Melillo presides over what he says is America's oldest continually operating performing arts institution. In one way or another, BAM has been here since Abraham Lincoln's time. What makes it important, though, is not its age but its vibrancy. Melillo's arts complex in the increasingly trendy Fort Greene district has been central to the revitalisation of this New York borough. Across the East river, the gleaming towers of Manhattan house some of the citadels of the arts and cultural world, including the Lincoln Center, Broadway, and a succession of peerless art galleries. But BAMprospers simply by being different, by having a creative edge and a global outlook that increasingly gives the unfashionable district an artistic feel that is more akin to Paris or Berlin than to corporate America. \"I programme artistic work that aims not to duplicate what audiences can experience in Manhattan,\" Melillo says. \"It's not difficult to get here, but you have to give people a reason to come and that's what I do.\" Glyndebourne's visit comes in the context of BAM's extraordinary 20-year record of enticing some of the most interesting theatrical talents in the world. BAM is where the Royal Shakespeare Company comes every two years. It's where Robert Wilson works with Lou Reed and Philip Glass. It's where Peter Brook's work is performed, in a nearby theatre remodelled to feel like Brook's Th\u00e9tre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris. It's where Ingmar Bergman will bring Strindberg later this year. It's where Jonathan Miller will revive his staging of the St Matthew Passion. In this framework, the arrival of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's production of Makropoulos makes good sense. Lehnhoff himself agrees. As he sips tea in his Brooklyn hotel, the German director says that bringing this show to New York is a completely different exercise from reviving the standard international \"shared production\" on which so many opera houses now rely, not least to share costs. \"The impetus of the Glyndebourne working conditions remains when we present this work elsewhere,\" Lehnhoff says. \"The impetus comes from the fact that it's not just the singers, but some of the stage crew who have come over, so the Glyndebourne mark is always present. I do not have to start from scratch with new people.\" There was no mistaking the tautness of the Makropoulos production as it was unveiled to the American audience. The impact of Lehnhoff's version of Janacek's life-affirming story about a 337-year-old opera singer was every bit as great in Brooklyn as it was six years ago, when it was first performed in Sussex. And if Lehnhoff at times sounded giddily enthusiastic about the successful transatlantic translation, then he surely had some right to be. \"The Glyndebourne production conditions are perfect now,\" Lehnhoff says. \"I've worked in Bayreuth and Salzburg, but at Glyndebourne you get what you do not get anywhere else.

      "body": "<p>For a brief period last summer Bookham Technologies, a company that very few in the City had heard of prior to its April flotation, was in a stratosphere all of its own. The optical processor specialist was valued in excess of \u00a36bn, more than the entire Sainsbury group - despite having an annual turnover less than one of the supermarket's stores. </p> <p>Yet investors were strong believers that Bookham's products would play a crucial role in internet growth and backed it with their wallets. </p> <p>It thrust Andrew Rickman, who had founded the firm in a room above his garage 12 years ago, into the limelight. The 25% stake that he and his wife Nichola owned was valued at \u00a32bn and, in a crazy market where every management consultant was trying to float a technology firm and dreaming of making millions, it was too good a tale to ignore. </p> <p>Ten months on Dr Rickman was trying to explain the reasons for Bookham's second disappointing trading update in less than one month. The shares have now fallen 80% from their one-time high. </p> <p>Based on last night's closing price, Bookham is now valued at \u00a3863m and the Rickman family has looked on as the value of their shares has fallen by \u00a31.8bn. Dr Rickman was dogged in his defence of the firm which he believes will still become a global player. </p> <p>He will have been able to take some comfort from the fact that five months after the company floated, and when the shares were trading at around \u00a333, he and other managers and founder shareholders at Bookham had dis posed of some of their stake. They only sold a tiny percentage of their overall holdings to satisfy demand from other investor. The sale netted the Rickmans \u00a340m. </p> <p>Shares in Bookham fell 12% to close at 691p yesterday after the Abingdon, Oxfordshire- based firm warned that full-year revenues for 2001 would be approximately \u00a315m less than expected. </p> <p>It said: \"Bookham is expecting a marked downturn in demand for its mini-dual inline [DIL] products. The company expects that this will impact on the first half of the year, resulting in slower top line growth.\" </p> <p>The loss for the quarter came in at \u00a38.5m, while revenues jumped 49% to \u00a311.5m, in line with expectations that had been lowered following last month's profits warning. Lower than hoped for orders from Nortel Networks - which accounts for more than 50% of Bookham's revenues - had forced the initial caution. </p> <p>Analysts said further unexpected bad news so soon after the initial profit warning had hit Bookham's already damaged credibility among City investors. </p> <p>\"In this business consistency wins you your best friends but Bookham has been consistently inconsistent,\" said Navdeep Sheera, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney who is moving his \"speculate\" recommendation on the stock down to the equivalent of a \"sell\". </p> <p>Mr Sheera emphasised, however, that with \u00a3226m cash in the bank Bookham still had enough money to see it through the next 18 months to two years, by which time it hopes to make a profit. </p> <p>Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston also rate the stock a \"sell\" and say it is overvalued compared to US competitors. </p> <p>Bookham is without a finance director after the previous holder of the post was forced to retire due to ill-health at the end of last year. </p> <p>Dr Rickman said he was optimistic that much of the revenue shortfall for the year would be made up through better sales of other products which he believes are unique and will be in strong demand from customers. He disagreed with analysts who fear that future sales could be affected by the financial difficulties experienced by key customers like Lucent, which account for 10% of revenues. </p> <p>Dr Rickman added that the work done building new manufacturing facilities, buying overseas rivals and recruiting new engineers since the company floated, placed it in \"an extremely good position\", a global star in the optical networking space. </p> <p>Whether the share price will likewise regain its former sparkle is another matter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a brief period last summer Bookham Technologies, a company that very few in the City had heard of prior to its April flotation, was in a stratosphere all of its own. The optical processor specialist was valued in excess of \u00a36bn, more than the entire Sainsbury group - despite having an annual turnover less than one of the supermarket's stores. Yet investors were strong believers that Bookham's products would play a crucial role in internet growth and backed it with their wallets. It thrust Andrew Rickman, who had founded the firm in a room above his garage 12 years ago, into the limelight. The 25% stake that he and his wife Nichola owned was valued at \u00a32bn and, in a crazy market where every management consultant was trying to float a technology firm and dreaming of making millions, it was too good a tale to ignore. Ten months on Dr Rickman was trying to explain the reasons for Bookham's second disappointing trading update in less than one month. The shares have now fallen 80% from their one-time high. Based on last night's closing price, Bookham is now valued at \u00a3863m and the Rickman family has looked on as the value of their shares has fallen by \u00a31.8bn. Dr Rickman was dogged in his defence of the firm which he believes will still become a global player. He will have been able to take some comfort from the fact that five months after the company floated, and when the shares were trading at around \u00a333, he and other managers and founder shareholders at Bookham had dis posed of some of their stake. They only sold a tiny percentage of their overall holdings to satisfy demand from other investor. The sale netted the Rickmans \u00a340m. Shares in Bookham fell 12% to close at 691p yesterday after the Abingdon, Oxfordshire- based firm warned that full-year revenues for 2001 would be approximately \u00a315m less than expected. It said: \"Bookham is expecting a marked downturn in demand for its mini-dual inline [DIL] products. The company expects that this will impact on the first half of the year, resulting in slower top line growth.\" The loss for the quarter came in at \u00a38.5m, while revenues jumped 49% to \u00a311.5m, in line with expectations that had been lowered following last month's profits warning. Lower than hoped for orders from Nortel Networks - which accounts for more than 50% of Bookham's revenues - had forced the initial caution. Analysts said further unexpected bad news so soon after the initial profit warning had hit Bookham's already damaged credibility among City investors. \"In this business consistency wins you your best friends but Bookham has been consistently inconsistent,\" said Navdeep Sheera, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney who is moving his \"speculate\" recommendation on the stock down to the equivalent of a \"sell\". Mr Sheera emphasised, however, that with \u00a3226m cash in the bank Bookham still had enough money to see it through the next 18 months to two years, by which time it hopes to make a profit. Analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston also rate the stock a \"sell\" and say it is overvalued compared to US competitors. Bookham is without a finance director after the previous holder of the post was forced to retire due to ill-health at the end of last year. Dr Rickman said he was optimistic that much of the revenue shortfall for the year would be made up through better sales of other products which he believes are unique and will be in strong demand from customers. He disagreed with analysts who fear that future sales could be affected by the financial difficulties experienced by key customers like Lucent, which account for 10% of revenues. Dr Rickman added that the work done building new manufacturing facilities, buying overseas rivals and recruiting new engineers since the company floated, placed it in \"an extremely good position\", a global star in the optical networking space. Whether the share price will likewise regain its former sparkle is another matter.",

The government has been pushing mediation rather than litigation when families break down. But grandparents tend to be left out in the cold. \"There's very little mediation for grandparents,\" says Chesterman. \"I don't think there are enough resources in family mediation services to deal with the extended family.\" Andrea Rivers, a family law barrister and mediator, says: \"The usual model at the moment is a couple who have split up amica bly and want some help sorting out money and children.\" </p> <p>The situation is tougher still for people whose grandchildren are fostered or adopted. Although it is possible for a contact order in favour of grandparents to be made at the same time as an adoption order, Alison Richards, legal adviser at the Family Rights Group, knows of no case in which such an order has been made: \"Generally, there's a belief in this country that contact with the birth family is a bad thing . . . if a parent has done wrong, the grandparent is implicated.\" </p> <p>The problem seems to be our tradition of \"closed\" adoption.

The school picked the busy sea lanes around Hawaii because they were considered safe.</p> <p>They were anything but safe on Friday afternoon, when the Greeneville's crew blew the main ballast tank, executing an emergency procedure which sent the 6,900-tonne submarine shooting up wards at an angle of 30 degrees. As the submarine sped towards the surface, most of the training ship's students and 20 crew were below decks.</p> <p>Second engineer Sakichi Atsuta said he was taking medication in the bathroom. Takashi Nakamura, a young deckhand, was washing his clothes. Tetsuo Hama was eating lunch. Others were resting in their cabins. Some of the students were tidying away the dishes after a meal.</p> <p><b> Impact</b><br></p> <p>Moments later they were jolted by a double impact. The lights died and they heard the screech of metal tearing through metal. Within seconds water gushed in through a huge hole in the hull.</p> <p>\"Everyone was in a panic,\" said Shukuo Nakamura, a deck hand. \"'Everyone go up!' someone was shouting. 'Go up because the waves are coming.'</p> <p>\"And then a big wave crashed against us and I was thrown into the water.\"</p> <p>Hideo Okayama rushed out in time to see the menacingly dark profile of the submarine break surface. \"I saw something come up and I thought it was a whale,\" he said.</p> <p>As water flooded through the lower decks, the senior officers ordered every one to climb to the top of the ship. \"We were already at the top of the ship and all I heard was someone screaming 'Danger! Danger!'\" Mr Okayama said.</p> <p>Within minutes the bulk of the ship was submerged. Many could not recall how they made it to the life rafts in the ensuing chaos.</p> <p>\"It was total panic,\" the first mate, Ryoichi Miya, said.</p> <p>Mr Nakamura was among those who helped students to one of the three liferafts, where they huddled in diesel-polluted water for nearly 50 minutes while the submarine prowled nearby. Fortunately the sea was warm and fairly calm.</p> <p>Twenty-six of the 35 people on board were saved. The rest are believed to have been trapped in the ship as it plunged 550 metres to the floor of the Pacific, nine miles from Honolulu.</p> <p>The survivors blamed the crew of the Greeneville after hearing that guests had been trying out the controls of the submarine.</p> <p>\"A civilian wouldn't know what to do,\" Mr Miya said.\"It's absolutely unforgivable if a civilian was operating it.\"</p> <p>As the first survivors returned home, Japanese news programmes broadcast extensive coverage of the shocked coastal community of Uwajima, in western Japan.</p> <p>Yoshiko Kamado, whose 16-year-old son Atsushi was rescued, told reporters that she believed the surfacing drill had been performed to impress the civilian guests.</p> <p>\"I sense laxness. I am all the more annoyed since I heard that the area is mostly crowded with training vessels and cruise ships. I just cannot stand it,\" she told the Kyodo news wire.</p> <p>As increasingly angry editorials appear in the Japanese media, Washington and Tokyo have attempted to minimise the damage to relations between the two countries. President George Bush has apologised, and compensation has been promised. But explanations have been slow in coming. The US has confirmed that two civilian guests were at the controls but has refused to say what they were doing.</p> <p>Washington has been reluctant to grant Japanese requests for the ship to be salvaged so that the bodies can be retrieved. Officials admit that recovering it would be technically difficult and expensive.</p> <p>The US has begun using a deep sea robot to locate the wreckage and assess the possibility of a salvage operation.</p>",

Nine people, including four 17-year-old students, have been missing, believed dead, since Friday, when the 110-metre (360ft) Greeneville carried out an emergency surfacing drill almost immediately below the 53-metre Ehime Maru. The ship was carrying a party of 13 students and two teachers from the Uwajima fisheries high school on a study tour to catch swordfish, tuna and shark. The school picked the busy sea lanes around Hawaii because they were considered safe. They were anything but safe on Friday afternoon, when the Greeneville's crew blew the main ballast tank, executing an emergency procedure which sent the 6,900-tonne submarine shooting up wards at an angle of 30 degrees. As the submarine sped towards the surface, most of the training ship's students and 20 crew were below decks. Second engineer Sakichi Atsuta said he was taking medication in the bathroom. Takashi Nakamura, a young deckhand, was washing his clothes. Tetsuo Hama was eating lunch. Others were resting in their cabins. Some of the students were tidying away the dishes after a meal. Impact Moments later they were jolted by a double impact. The lights died and they heard the screech of metal tearing through metal. Within seconds water gushed in through a huge hole in the hull. \"Everyone was in a panic,\" said Shukuo Nakamura, a deck hand. \"'Everyone go up!' someone was shouting. 'Go up because the waves are coming.' \"And then a big wave crashed against us and I was thrown into the water.\" Hideo Okayama rushed out in time to see the menacingly dark profile of the submarine break surface. \"I saw something come up and I thought it was a whale,\" he said. As water flooded through the lower decks, the senior officers ordered every one to climb to the top of the ship. \"We were already at the top of the ship and all I heard was someone screaming 'Danger! Danger!'\" Mr Okayama said. Within minutes the bulk of the ship was submerged. Many could not recall how they made it to the life rafts in the ensuing chaos. \"It was total panic,\" the first mate, Ryoichi Miya, said. Mr Nakamura was among those who helped students to one of the three liferafts, where they huddled in diesel-polluted water for nearly 50 minutes while the submarine prowled nearby. Fortunately the sea was warm and fairly calm. Twenty-six of the 35 people on board were saved. The rest are believed to have been trapped in the ship as it plunged 550 metres to the floor of the Pacific, nine miles from Honolulu. The survivors blamed the crew of the Greeneville after hearing that guests had been trying out the controls of the submarine. \"A civilian wouldn't know what to do,\" Mr Miya said.\"It's absolutely unforgivable if a civilian was operating it.\" As the first survivors returned home, Japanese news programmes broadcast extensive coverage of the shocked coastal community of Uwajima, in western Japan. Yoshiko Kamado, whose 16-year-old son Atsushi was rescued, told reporters that she believed the surfacing drill had been performed to impress the civilian guests. \"I sense laxness. I am all the more annoyed since I heard that the area is mostly crowded with training vessels and cruise ships. I just cannot stand it,\" she told the Kyodo news wire. As increasingly angry editorials appear in the Japanese media, Washington and Tokyo have attempted to minimise the damage to relations between the two countries. President George Bush has apologised, and compensation has been promised. But explanations have been slow in coming. The US has confirmed that two civilian guests were at the controls but has refused to say what they were doing. Washington has been reluctant to grant Japanese requests for the ship to be salvaged so that the bodies can be retrieved. Officials admit that recovering it would be technically difficult and expensive. The US has begun using a deep sea robot to locate the wreckage and assess the possibility of a salvage operation.",

KPMG took the action because it did not believe the former striker had the money to fund the \u00a32m rescue deal he has been promising since July. \"We could cease trading at any point in time,\" said the liquidator Blair Nimmo. \"But it is also a football club and we are trying to recognise that.\" Internet sales of tickets for the 2002 World Cup have been delayed in Japan and South Korea for up to three days because of technical problems. Fifa wanted to take applications on its website (www.fifaworldcup.com) but fans in the two host countries can still apply in writing. Allocations will be decided by a draw. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

As well as the British premiere of his horn concerto, the Hamburgisches Konzert, first performed two weeks ago in Hamburg, there was a chance for London to catch up with an even more recent piece, Sippal, Dobbal, Nadimegeduvel, a song cycle to poems by Sandor Weores, finished last year. </p> <p>Ligeti's tribute to his fellow countryman - he describes Weores as \"Hungary's Mozart\" - is typically wry and playful. The seven little settings pit a mezzo-soprano (the spell-binding Katalin Karolyi) against four percussionists, who as well as having to strike and stroke the usual range of instruments, have to play harmonicas and swanee whistles. Unaccountably, the Sinfonietta's programme included no translations of the texts, but the diverse ways in which they are delivered - as guttural exclamations, a patter song, a lilting lullaby - suggest that all human life is contained in the poems, while the percussionists create ever-changing webs of colour around them. The result is typically unclassifiable; if Ligeti ever gets around to writing the second opera he has contemplated now for more than 20 years (based on Alice in Wonderland), it might, one suspects, sound a bit like this. </p> <p>What is unexpected about the Hamburgisches Konzert, though, is how it harks back to the world of Ligeti's earlier works. Harmonically everything may have changed - one of the points of the new concerto, in which the solo horn is accompanied by four natural horns in the chamber orchestra, is the exploration of tunings and harmonies outside the conventional western system. </p> <p>But the shifting textures of the first of the six tiny movements look back to Ligeti's musical cloudscapes of the 1960s, while the frantic canon for the orchestra that ends the fourth recalls the manic clockworks of a few years later. Elsewhere, there are long, sinuous melodies and echo effects between the soloist and his four siblings that conjure up the forest images so deeply embedded in central European folklore. </p> <p>Somehow all these disparate miniatures add up to a substantial experience. Ligeti challenges the performers in new ways, without resorting to cheap effects: the horn part is ferociously difficult - Michael Thompson seemed to have mastered it consummately - and the writing for the orchestra isn't far behind.

Ireland now directs Matt Costello in the part; he, in turn, played Eddie while at drama college with his partner, Kathryn Howden, playing Beatrice. The couple are repeating that experience in this production, now at about the right age. Confused? You won't be. </p> <p>For Miller's writing is about all our lives, and remains so despite social change and alleged progress. The setting for A View from the Bridge might be the Sicilian-American area of Brooklyn in the 1950s, but in its portrayal of how communities, from individual families upwards, deal with the presence of outsiders, the play still resonates. </p> <p>The Italian immigrants being sheltered by close-knit communities in the tenement blocks can't help but make us think of asylum-seekers across Europe: the furious vitriol meted out to them from some quarters, the lack of communities ready to welcome them. When Carbone yells his anguished, broken plea, \"I want my name\", it articulates all the insecurity that forms tabloid fury now. </p> <p>But Miller never tackles issues without a human dimension to them. Here it's the fate of Carbone, the working man who has taken in his wife's niece and raised her as his own. His unspeakable and unspoken love for her scars the family interactions - every meal, every edgy exchange between him and Beatrice. When love arrives for her in the form of Rodolpho, a family drama becomes the stuff of classic tragedy, \"a high visible arc moving in full view to a single explosion\" as Miller once described the play. </p> <p>Ireland's production is very nearly perfect, with only a few uneven accents and a slightly cool and underwhelming first act detracting from an otherwise compelling evening. Costello and Howden shine as Eddie and Beatrice, their lives ready to snap into dysfunction at any moment. If anything, Howden's Beatrice, the long-suffering and self- deluding broken woman, has the edge. In the second act especially, her every move - to clear the table or to make love to Eddie - has palpable tragedy running through it. </p> <p>When a production of the play gets the central couple right, as this does, then it's the smaller details that make the difference between a perfunctory and memorable performance. The music here is perfect, all aching, impending menace, while Saul Radomsky's set of the house's interior, with its openness and yet hidden, interior depths, is powerfully suggestive. Everything is lit as if Edward Hopper was directing an episode of Happy Days. The result is the American Dream gone more badly wrong than we have words to say. </p> <p>\u0095 Until 10 March.

But where Adshead's play is brutally shocking, Wertenbaker's raises questions about nationhood, identity and history. </p> <p>Wertenbaker approaches her subject obliquely but the nub of the issue is this. Alexander, a Macedonian teacher, has escaped persecution and made it to Britain; three years later his indomitable mother, Petra, arrives at Heathrow in search of him. Alexander has disappeared into a world of community work and street-cleaning: the proud and institutionally detained Petra goes on hunger-strike until the authorities find her son. Eventually they meet in a confrontation of irreconcilable attitudes: the one embodies an intransigent Macedonian nationalism, the other the necessary assimilation of the exile. </p> <p>As always, Wertenbaker is not afraid to tackle big issues: above all, she attacks the idea of historical paralysis. Britain, she argues, is locked into a notion of itself as an island fortress destined to repel unwanted boarders. Other nations equally are walled in by their oppressive past: to that end she shows even Petra's chauvinism crumbling. Behind the play lurks a vision of a world where we are not all defined by nationhood and where the free passage of peoples is a sustainable ideal. </p> <p>Wertenbaker's ideas are fascinating, even if their dramatic resolution is not always plausible. The big mother-son confrontation packs the right emotional punch. But Wertenbaker also invents a harrassed immigration official rather too symbolically named Simon Le Britten. And, while he effectively embodies the arbitrary power and rash certainty of the bureaucrat, the scene where he winds up in a detention centre on New Year's Eve to sort out Petra's case defies belief. </p> <p>There is a knockdown performance from Olympia Dukakis as Petra, a superb embodiment of maternal and nationalistic pride. Adam Kotz as her son persuasively stands for exiled absorption and there is good work from Clive Merrison as the emotionally involved desk-wallah. Even if you feel Wertenbaker manipulates the dramatic situation to suit the argument, her play adds weight to the growing canon of asylum dramas. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 10.

Cale has one of the finest, most underrated catalogues in rock, but you might have come away thinking that \u00a319.50 for a virtual busk of a performance (no staging, little in the way of between-songs chat) was taking the unplugged piss. </p> <p>Once you'd admired Cale's groovy leather trews there was nothing in the way of any visual dynamic - this from a man whose fondness for ski masks and enacted psychosis once marked him out as the thinking person's Ozzy Osbourne. But Cale does know his masks, and it's hard to tell if this was just his take on the ultimate mask: acting natural. </p> <p>This performance was one of bland reserve, with just the occasional chill to remind us that the alien still lurks in his gut. After a breezy, acoustic skip through a few songs old and new, hopes were raised that he might be about to essay something more innovative. A burst of radio static, a skippety computerised heartbeat, treated noise squalls from Cole, and a slightly askew piano motif from Cale ... But this dip into crackly electronica proved literally to be a one-off, and the rest of the set was played decidedly safe. </p> <p>The acoustic treatment did suit songs such as the ghost-filled Ballad of Cable Hogue - one of Cale's many tales of lost prairies and road-movie regrets. But even here he managed to spoil things by taking too many of his best songs at the same brisk clip. The melancholy Chinese Envoy (surely the only rock song to namecheck Cardinal Richelieu?) was revved up a notch or two to no good effect. </p> <p>This is essentially the same show I saw Cale do seven years ago (as commemorated on the peerless live resume Fragments of a Rainy Season), when his subtle grasp of theatrics had me on the edge of my seat. Now, by comparison, he was poised, polished, but not much more than chirpily proficient. Songs such as Paris 1919 and Thoughtless Kind cry out for some kind of chamber orchestra treatment; I can't have been alone in assuming this was why the Queen Elizabeth Hall had been chosen as the venue.

(Penguin), in which they explore the performance of Tony Blair's first administration. Here they choose the essential books to read if you want to understand New Labour, and some favourite political novels. Read extracts from Did Things Get Better? Read Polly Toynbee and David Walker's online discussion Buy Did Things Get Better? at Amazon.co.uk David Walker 1. The Cunning of Unreason by John Dunn A subtle, pessimistic book about democracy by an original mind. Read Dunn and the future of elective self-government looks bleak. 2. Mandelson and the Making of New Labour by Donald MacIntyre More than just a biography of the prince of darkness, Don MacIntyre brilliantly conveys how Labour's defeats in 1983, 1987 and 1992 felt. This remains the great source book on why Mandelson and Gordon Brown fell out. 3. Primary Colors by Anonymous (Joe Klein) This is still the best book about Bill Clinton - and Monica and Hillary - and the sheer exhilaration of running for national office in the USA. Of course it's a novel, but it speaks truth about power. 4. Politics and the Pound by Philip Stephens The essential book about the John Major premiership and the ERM debacle. Money is the mother's milk of politics, they say; sterling's fate was John Major's and may yet be Tony Blair's. 5.

These are the hard lads of the international dance circuit, the dancers who have forged their image out of Levi jeans, dockers' biceps, Desperate Dan jaw lines and metal-tapped Blundstone boots. Ever since Tap Dogs first took Sydney Theatre Festival by the scruff of its neck in 1995, the show has apparently been on a mission to prove that dancing isn't just for wimps and girlies. </p> <p>The resulting testosterone-fest would be comical if the act were any less slick. Tap Dogs is danced on a stage that famously looks more like a construction site or a steelyard than the orchid-festooned ballrooms in which Fred Astaire used to rattle around. The dancers swing from scaffolding, teeter on planks and crash against corrugated iron, working up a seriously macho sweat. All of the visual jokes and puns are emphatically boysie - like the routine in which they pound out the rhythm of a steam train in a cloud of dry ice, dodge between blowtorches, or pretend to take a piss between their tapping toes. At frequent intervals they get out screwdrivers to adjust the screws on their metal taps - a deliberately far cry from dancers retying their satin ribbons or pulling up their tights. </p> <p>The tap style which the dancers favour is also heavy duty. Though it's partly an illusion created by the amplification of the floor, the muscular heft of the dancers and the heavy percussion of the music, it seems that every step bears down hard into the ground. Compared to Astaire, who could seem as light as a water boatman, his witty feet splintering the dance phrase into staccato beats, these guys are all drum and bass. </p> <p>But there's an arch self commentary going on too, which allows the dancers to mock their own toughness and occasionally play with a lighter palette of movement. As the show is building to its climax, two of the men swill buckets of water into a shallow trough and the others, clad in rubber boots, make ready to jump boisterously into it. The audience in the front rows flinch back from the expected soaking but of course the dancers place their boots in the water as delicately as ballerinas and perform a sweet splashy quartet. Elsewhere, too, they will stall the racket and skim the ground in lazy syncopation, giving us a chance to listen to nuances of rhythm and phrase. </p> <p>But these are only brief interludes in the big, noisy picture. At 75 minutes, Tap Dogs does what it does with expert style. Any longer and the show would become a crashing bore. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 3. Box office: 020-7863 8000.</p>",
