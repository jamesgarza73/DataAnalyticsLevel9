      "body": "<p>At the dawn of the third industrial revolution in the north, based on knowledge, millions of people in the south are still waiting for the benefits of the second - electricity, motor and air transport, the telephone. Yet the latest wheeze among policymakers in developed countries is to alleviate poverty in developing countries with computers and mobile phones. It sounds like a sick joke until you realise that they are deadly serious. </p> <p>At all the big international meetings so far this year - Davos in January, Washington in the spring, Okinawa last month - the hottest topic on the development agenda was how to harness the power of information and communication technology to improve the lot of the poor. </p> <p>Struck by the apparent ability of ICT to transform the performance of the US economy, envious governments in Japan, Britain and the rest of Europe have all been attempting to replicate the experience of America to boost the incomes of their citizens for some time. Now they want to spread the fruits of higher productivity further afield. </p> <p>The potential benefits of ICT to developing countries are not in doubt. The \"death of distance\" brought about by the internet allows professional services, such as software, education/training, medicine and law to be provided remotely. It opens up new opportunities in marketing, purchasing and collaboration with large numbers of potential suppliers and customers over a large geographical area. It puts separated family members in touch with each other, spreads knowledge with ease and democratises government in places where the authorities allow the internet to flourish. </p> <p>Some of the gains are already being realised and can be seen in Andhra Pradesh, the first Indian state to put government online; in Chile, which has been a leader in wiring schools; in Delhi where Harrods is thinking about out sourcing a customer helpline; and in Morocco where local craftsmen are selling their wares to a global market on E-Souk.com. </p> <p>But it does not take a genius to figure out that ICT is of limited use in places without the right physical infrastructure, level of education, business environment, and stable and democratic political regimes, effectively excluding vast swathes of the planet's population. </p> <p>Hence the experience of ICT use to date. For while ICT is spreading rapidly through developing countries - in 1995-98 developing countries connected more than 155m telephone lines, 105m mobile subscribers and 4m leased lines - the figures disguise a wide disparity between them and also with the north, where growth is even faster, opening up a huge and expanding digital divide between rich and poor nations. </p> <p>In Africa, for example, with 739m people, there are only 14m phone lines - fewer than in Manhattan - and 80% of those are in six countries. The geographical distribution of internet hosts further illustrates the wide differences in connectivity between rich and poor countries. While last year Britain had 15m internet subscribers, there were only 1m on the African continent. The average rich industrialised country has roughly 40 times the per capita number of computers of a sub-Saharan African country (excluding South Africa), 100 times as many mobile phones, and 1,600 times as many internet hosts. </p> <p>Unless, the north intervenes to equalise the situation, the south will fall further behind, widening the yawning gap between rich and poor nations to even more obscene proportions. </p> <p>Rising to the challenge will require the involvement of both the private and public sectors. In countries where there is a market for their products and services, hi-tech companies will not need any persuading to enter. After all, in an industry where prices are tumbling, they need high-volume markets to keep their shareholders happy. But they will shun countries where there is no prospect of a juicy profit. Market failure dictates that rich countries must intervene and help developing countries with technical advice and large sums of money so that they can lay the foundations of an information society. </p> <p><strong> Bridging the gap</strong><br> </p> <p> Thankfully, efforts are already under way to bridge the digital divide. Institutions such as the World Bank have long recognised the potential of ICT as a development tool, setting up, for example, InfoDev, a multi-donor grant facility with the objective of promoting innovative ICT projects in poor countries. The World Bank's latest plan is to establish the Global Development Gateway, an internet portal which will act as a one-stop shop for those interested in development issues, although it is dogged by controversy over control of content. </p> <p>In Okinawa, the Group of Eight - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia - agreed to set up the Digital Opportunities Taskforce (Dot Force), comprising two representatives, one public, one private, from each country.

      "bodyText": "At the dawn of the third industrial revolution in the north, based on knowledge, millions of people in the south are still waiting for the benefits of the second - electricity, motor and air transport, the telephone. Yet the latest wheeze among policymakers in developed countries is to alleviate poverty in developing countries with computers and mobile phones. It sounds like a sick joke until you realise that they are deadly serious. At all the big international meetings so far this year - Davos in January, Washington in the spring, Okinawa last month - the hottest topic on the development agenda was how to harness the power of information and communication technology to improve the lot of the poor. Struck by the apparent ability of ICT to transform the performance of the US economy, envious governments in Japan, Britain and the rest of Europe have all been attempting to replicate the experience of America to boost the incomes of their citizens for some time. Now they want to spread the fruits of higher productivity further afield. The potential benefits of ICT to developing countries are not in doubt. The \"death of distance\" brought about by the internet allows professional services, such as software, education/training, medicine and law to be provided remotely. It opens up new opportunities in marketing, purchasing and collaboration with large numbers of potential suppliers and customers over a large geographical area. It puts separated family members in touch with each other, spreads knowledge with ease and democratises government in places where the authorities allow the internet to flourish. Some of the gains are already being realised and can be seen in Andhra Pradesh, the first Indian state to put government online; in Chile, which has been a leader in wiring schools; in Delhi where Harrods is thinking about out sourcing a customer helpline; and in Morocco where local craftsmen are selling their wares to a global market on E-Souk.com. But it does not take a genius to figure out that ICT is of limited use in places without the right physical infrastructure, level of education, business environment, and stable and democratic political regimes, effectively excluding vast swathes of the planet's population. Hence the experience of ICT use to date. For while ICT is spreading rapidly through developing countries - in 1995-98 developing countries connected more than 155m telephone lines, 105m mobile subscribers and 4m leased lines - the figures disguise a wide disparity between them and also with the north, where growth is even faster, opening up a huge and expanding digital divide between rich and poor nations. In Africa, for example, with 739m people, there are only 14m phone lines - fewer than in Manhattan - and 80% of those are in six countries. The geographical distribution of internet hosts further illustrates the wide differences in connectivity between rich and poor countries. While last year Britain had 15m internet subscribers, there were only 1m on the African continent. The average rich industrialised country has roughly 40 times the per capita number of computers of a sub-Saharan African country (excluding South Africa), 100 times as many mobile phones, and 1,600 times as many internet hosts. Unless, the north intervenes to equalise the situation, the south will fall further behind, widening the yawning gap between rich and poor nations to even more obscene proportions. Rising to the challenge will require the involvement of both the private and public sectors. In countries where there is a market for their products and services, hi-tech companies will not need any persuading to enter. After all, in an industry where prices are tumbling, they need high-volume markets to keep their shareholders happy. But they will shun countries where there is no prospect of a juicy profit. Market failure dictates that rich countries must intervene and help developing countries with technical advice and large sums of money so that they can lay the foundations of an information society. Bridging the gap Thankfully, efforts are already under way to bridge the digital divide. Institutions such as the World Bank have long recognised the potential of ICT as a development tool, setting up, for example, InfoDev, a multi-donor grant facility with the objective of promoting innovative ICT projects in poor countries. The World Bank's latest plan is to establish the Global Development Gateway, an internet portal which will act as a one-stop shop for those interested in development issues, although it is dogged by controversy over control of content. In Okinawa, the Group of Eight - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Russia - agreed to set up the Digital Opportunities Taskforce (Dot Force), comprising two representatives, one public, one private, from each country. By next year's summit in Genoa, Dot Force is expected to have formulated a global action plan to help bridge the digital divide. While welcome, what is missing from all this activity is one crucial element - some humility about what can be achieved. Amid all the hype surrounding the internet, there is a danger that governments will be diverted from the most important task, that of ensuring people in developing countries have clean water, basic education and the drugs needed to fight preventable diseases. As Francisco Rodriguez and Ernest J Wilson, of the University of Maryland, put it in their InfoDev working paper, entitled Are Poor Countries Losing the Information Revolution?, the poor need penicillin before Pentiums. That should not prevent governments in the north pursuing their ICT development agenda but a story from Uganda, quoted in another InfoDev working paper by staff at the World Bank, makes sobering reading. Kisiize Hospital in the south-west of the country, 400 miles from Kampala, has tried for many years to obtain a connection from the national telephone company. But remoteness from the nearest exchange thwarted its efforts. Telephone technology, coupled with the launch of a second national carrier, gave it new hope. But the hospital's location at the bottom of a valley required the installation of at least two relay towers at prohibitive cost. So it finally opted for a satellite connection.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a terrorist bombing campaign being launched in Britain with devices never seen before by the security services was raised yesterday after a cache of explosives was unearthed in an Oxfordshire wood. Six army bomb disposal experts worked for almost 48 hours to make safe eight sophisticated bombs, packed with brass nuts and designed to kill or maim, which had been found buried at a former police training centre. Police refused to speculate on the identity of the terrorists, although it was thought unlikely that Irish splinter groups were responsible. They have not ruled out a theory that the bombmakers were racists planning to target the Notting Hill carnival, which was taking place yesterday and today, nor that animal rights activists could have made the devices - though they are much more sophisticated than such groups are known to have used before. Police are comparing the devices with another found on a stone wall at a farm 30 miles away in Gloucestershire last Sunday, and which could have been meant as a test but failed to go off. The cache was found by a man walking his dog at Eynsham Hall, near Witney, on Friday afternoon. The animal was attracted by the smell of the explosive and pawed at loose soil beneath a tree. Bomb experts spent Friday evening, all day Saturday and yesterday morning making the devices safe. Yesterday afternoon search teams continued to comb the area in case other devices had been hidden. The bombs were taken to a laboratory in Kent for examination. Police were surprised by the sophistication of the devices.

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Telekom is close to completing the takeover of US mobile phone group Powertel for just under $6bn (\u00a34bn), according to weekend reports. The move marks its second big American acquisition, coming in the wake of the $46bn deal to acquire VoiceStream Wireless in July. According to the German press, a takeover is likely to be announced this week, but no one from Deutsche Telekom was available for comment. As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is expected to be be structured as an all-share deal of Powertel by Voicestream. Powertel, like VoiceStream, is one of the few US mobile operators that follows the GSM standard used across Europe. The company, based in West Point, Georgia, operates a network in the southeast of the US where Voicestream does not have its own coverage. With 727,000 mobile phone customers, it has a listing on the Nasdaq stock market and was valued at $2.6bn on Friday - less than half the price Deutsche Telekom is said to be ready to pay.",

      "bodyText": "A British engineer was recovering in an Indian hospital yesterday after being bludgeoned and left for dead by bandits who murdered his fiancee and her son in a remote region of the Himalayas. Martin Young, a 32-year-old chartered civil engineer from Hampshire, was trekking in the mountainous Himachal Pradesh state of northern India when a band of villagers ambushed him, his Spanish partner, Maria Angles Girones, aged 34, and her 14-year-old son Cristobal. The four men beat them with wooden clubs and pushed them into a gorge before making off with a camera and \u00a3340-worth of Indian rupees and US dollars. Mr Young was rescued when a group of workers, inspecting a local power project, came across him and the bodies, which last night remained in the gorge. The attack happened on Friday night in a remote area called Tundaghosh - an eight-hour trek from the nearest driveable road and some 125 miles north of the state capital of Shimla. The trio had been camping in nearby Manikaran, a small town near the trekking centre of Kullu, in the Parbati Valley, but had set off to climb through the dense vegation without a porter or guide. The region is popular with tourists - but has been nicknamed the Bermuda Triangle of India because at least a dozen foreign tourists have disappeared in the area over the past six years. This month, a German holidaymaker was killed and his partner injured while trekking in the Manikaran valley - prompting the Foreign Office to urge tourists only to travel in large groups and with local guides. Tthe trek had been a final trip for the trio before Mr Young, an Outward Bound enthusiast who had been work ing in New Delhi for the past eight months for the engineering firm Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, returned to Britain to be given another foreign posting. Last night, as police in Kullu confirmed the motive for the attack had been robbery, the engineer was being transferred by ambulance from a hospital in Kullu to one in New Delhi where his company had employed a doctor and nurse. Martin Nielson, the director of Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick, for whom Mr Young has worked for the past nine years, said: \"He has had some pretty serious injuries to his head and chest but he is comfortable.\" The Foreign Office confirmed that his injuries are not life-threatening and any surgery is believed to have been minor. Mr Nielson added that the engineer, who has spent the past five years working in the Falklands and Pakistan before moving to Delhi, had met his fiancee, from Valencia, a year ago. The couple had been engaged for a couple of months. \"We have been at pains to extend our sympathies to him, to his family and to the family of his fiancee in Spain,\" Mr Nielson added. \"Martin is a very bright engineer, he's very popular, very outgoing and he' s someone who really thrives on being a professional expatriate.

      "bodyText": "The safety of the meningitis immunisation programme came under scrutiny yesterday when it emerged that 11 people have died following injections. Health officials insisted the deaths were not connected to the injection and maintained the programme was completely safe but the handling of the issue was criticised. Since the immunisation programme began last year, more than 16,000 \"adverse reactions\" to the vaccine have been reported to the medicines control agency. A Department of Health spokeswoman said two of the 11 had heart conditions, two died of group B meningitis - for which there is no vaccine - and one of a convulsion 10 days after the injection. The six others died of cot death. She added that the number of adverse reactions - which can range from a minor headache to death - was not unusual for the scale of the programme, the first in Europe. Officials from the Meningitis Research Foundation and Meningitis Trust said they were certain that immunisation was saving lives. The shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, said he was angry that no minister had come forward to quell public anxiety. \"If the public suspects that the government is withholding information, there is a danger they will lose confidence in the programme. The only way to dispel this is for a minister to say there is no basis for it. \"Instead they are hiding behind civil servants. That is stupid and cowardly. Ministers are paid take responsibility.\" John Fletcher, of the vaccination campaign group, Justice Awareness Basic Support, said: \"They always say there is no problem. Parents need to have all the information so they can make a balanced judgement. \"We have had many calls from parents whose children have suffered adverse reactions and believe the programme was introduced too quickly. In effect, ordinary people are the guinea pigs.\"",

The Football (Disorder) Act 2000 was introduced following violence caused by England fans at Euro 2000, which led to criticism of the government for failing to clamp down on trouble makers travelling abroad. Under the new law, police will for the first time have the right to ban those they suspect of taking part in football hooliganism even though they might not have a conviction. Many hooligans causing trouble during Euro 2000 were known to British police but could not be prevented from leaving the country because thay had not been convicted of a football offence Courts are expected to impose banning orders this week on known and suspected hooligans, from information provided by police, in an attempt to prevent them from travelling to Paris. The new law provides for a five-day control period in the run up to big matches abroad during which a banning order or notice to serve one can be imposed at any time. Surrender of passports will also become mandatory. Special courts will be sitting close to ports and main railway stations so that banning orders can be imposed on Saturday, the day of the match.

      "bodyText": "The UK has one of the worst records in Europe for treating heart disease, according to a new study. The level of NHS care for patients with heart conditions was found to be well below that provided in Germany, Italy and France; seriously ill patients have far less chance of receiving proven life-saving treatments than similar patients in mainland Europe; and patients have less time in intensive care after surgery. The research team, headed by the heart specialist Keith Fox of Edinburgh Royal infirmary, examined data from more than 3,000 patients in 29 countries, looking at heart attack victims and those with unstable angina. It found that UK hospitals lagged far behind their European counterparts in providing the latest diagnostic tests, surgical treatments and drugs such as aspirin and beta blockers. Professor Fox told Scotland on Sunday newspaper that differences \"in the management of heart disease and in the use of the more expensive medical treatments\" were worrying. In some instances the level of care was ranked alongside or below that offered in Greece and Turkey. The survey showed that only 2% of UK heart patients could expect to be treated with new \"super aspirin\" drugs, which prevent blood clots in surgery. Prof Fox said that more than 40% of heart patients in US centres received super aspirin, while his study indicated that 34% of German patients were given the drug. Only 9% of UK patients with unstable angina received balloon angioplasty treatment, compared with 49% in France. UK heart attack patients had the shortest hospital stays, averaging 7.9 days compared with more than 11 days in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Heart disease is one of the UK's biggest killers, accounting for 180,000 deaths a year. Stuart Cobbe, cardiology professor at Glasgow University, said of the survey results: \"Most other European countries have a substantially larger number of doctors and specialists per head of population than we have. \"When patients are treated by specialists they tend to receive more advanced treatments. Many patients in UK hospitals are treated by non-specialists, and even if they are treated by specialists these are hard-pressed and can't offer the same interventions as elsewhere in Europe.\" This month the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, announced the establishment of 10 cardiac emergency response teams. In the long term there would be more specialist heart disease doctors and more cardiac centres. Prof Fox's study will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology's annual conference in Amsterdam this week.",

      "bodyText": "For the best part of two years, the team of eccentric volunteers had laboured to create a perfect replica of a famous corner of 17th century London. Yesterday 100 square metres of smouldering ash was all that remained after the structure was torched in an extravagant re-enactment of the Great Fire of London. An estimated 20,000 people turned out to view the spectacle on the common at Great Torrington in north Devon, a beauty spot normally reserved for picnickers and bargain hunters at the car boot sale. The idea of acting out the Great Fire of 1666 was credited to the Torrington Cavaliers, a group which has raised many thousands of pounds for charity by, quite legally, raising fires. Since its foundation in 1970, the group has set fire to replicas of a Spanish galleon, the battleship Bismarck, the local church - which had been destroyed in the Civil War - and even the Houses of Parliament. But to mark the millennium year, the Cavaliers set about the demanding task of recreating the streets around Pudding Lane where the Great Fire started. Dave Kelly, chairman of the Cavaliers, carried out much of the research for the project, spending hours at Museum of London to make sure that the replica was as accurate as possible. The framework was constructed from tree trunks removed from a nearby school, while roof supports were reclaimed from the local market hall when it was refurbished. Other materials were donated by local builders, equipment was loaned and businesses chipped in with sponsorship. A team of volunteers put in some 5,000 hours to build the structure, which required temporary planning permission. With three fire engines and two ambulances standing by, the buildings were finally set ablaze on Saturday evening. Mr Kelly, 59, said the fire was his swansong. \"I've done 11 bonfires and I've never been sentimental,\" he said. \"I used to think 'bloody good job that's gone', but I was choked over this one because it was my last one.

      "bodyText": "A special 90-minute radio version of Alan Bennett's first play, Forty Years On (2.15pm, Radio 4), marks the 30th anniversary of the original West End production. Bennett (pictured, right) himself takes the role of the headmaster retiring after 50 years' teaching at Albion House. The dry pedantry of the character and his shock at the pupils' mockery of his golden memories in the end-of-term play are splendidly portrayed. Eleanor Bron plays Matron in Gordon House's rollicking production. Another character whose golden years have tarnished is the opening subject of Mark Carwardine's new series for Nature (9.0pm, Radio 4). In the past 20 years Britain has lost two-thirds of its house sparrows, and no one knows why. There are now fewer than 100 breeding females left in central London, a sorry tale repeated across the kingdom. Among those being blamed are farmers, cats, magpies, and even house builders whose modern dwellings lack the bird's preferred nesting crannies.",

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has been granted an injunction banning the release of a video which shows Charles Bronson, Britain's most violent prisoner, terrorising a teacher he took hostage last year. The footage shows Bronson leading Phil Danielson by a skipping rope during a 44-hour ordeal. Bare-chested and wearing a prison officer's hat, the convicted armed robber, who received a life sentence in February for the hostage-taking, which occurred in Hull prison, also brandishes a home-made spear. He is later to be seen holding a broken beer bottle to his captive's chest before drawing it across his own head. The film forms part of a three-hour documentary entitled Sincerely Yours, which also features footage of the 47-year-old being restrained by guards in Winson Green prison, Birmingham, in 1995. The documentary, made by the Newcastle-based company Mirage Productions, has been on sale by post for two weeks and is advertised, at the price of \u00a315.99, on Bronson's own website. Attempts by the Treasury solicitor to force the company to withdraw it failed, and on Friday Mr Straw sought an emergency injunction to prevent its distribution on the grounds that the prison service owned the copyright to the footage. Stephen Richards of Mirage Productions insisted it would not comply with the interim injunction. \"This is David against Golliath,\" he said. \"I strongly believe it is in the public interest to have this shown.

      "body": "<p>It's a summer night and my mother is not in the house. The Lady Who Lives Downstairs is keeping an eye on my brother, sister and me. I am the oldest so I must be calm, even though it feels as if we are alone. I'm too hot, so I kick back the sheet and lie in the dark, aware of the closeness of summer, the stuffiness of the room and my sister's even breathing from the other bed. Soon my mother will be home. It is the time between night and morning and it's deathly quiet with a stillness that makes me still, too, despite my restlessness. I listen for the sound of my mother's key in the lock.</p> <p>\"He'll be back soon,\" my mother said and I've been trying to believe her. I've lain awake, wondering why he hasn't asked to see me. \"Children aren't allowed to visit the grown-up ward,\" my mother tells me. But he can do anything, anything at all. If he wanted me to come, he would make it possible. I keep beating back the fear that he's forgotten me. Or perhaps he knows how naughty I've been. \"You must be good for Mummy,\" he said before he left and I've tried really hard but perhaps I haven't been good enough.</p> <p>\"Is Daddy going to die?\" I asked my mother when she came in one night to see if I was sleeping.</p> <p>\"No, of course not,\" she replied, sounding cross. I waited for the safe feeling her answer should have brought but it wouldn't come.</p> <p>Each long night, I feel the heat of summer. I am seven years old and it's the first time I've been aware of the changing seasons. When it is warm, Daddy plays with us outside; we suck lollies shaped like rockets from the ice cream van. This summer there is sun, but it feels dark. Even the days seem like night.</p> <p>I sit up suddenly. My mother is home. The front door shuts. I run to the top of the stairs and look down at her. Something's wrong. She's crying. I go down slowly, not sure what to do. I wait beside her, wanting her to tell me what is wrong yet fearful of knowing the terrible thing that's made her cry. I reach up to touch her but she pushes me away. I look at her angrily. \"I'm sorry, darling,\" she says and she holds me close but it's too tight, I want it to stop now, she's squashing me. \"Daddy is dead,\" she says, in a distant voice. \"He is never coming home.\"</p> <p>In that moment, everything changes. It is daylight now, but the darkness grows deeper. I am sitting in my father's chair, holding a big handkerchief. My eyes burn. I don't remember coming into the living room and sitting here. When did I start to cry? When will I be able to stop?</p> <p>\"Dead, dead, I hate the word dead!\" I shout, full of childish intensity. I'm trying to behave the way you should when someone dies. A grown-up would say these things and I know I must be grown up now.</p> <p>My sister is sitting on the floor, nursing her doll. We are each alone. From his playpen, my brother asks for cake. My sister and I look at him scornfully. It's much too soon for ordinary things.</p> <p>\"He doesn't understand,\" my mother says. I don't understand either but I know I mustn't say it. I'm not a baby any more.</p> <p>Day slips into night again, the cycles barely noticed. We have no sense of time passing. It is as if we are trapped in a single moment. We may never really move beyond it.</p> <p>All around us, there are pieces of my father: his carvings and paintings, many only half completed, are spread all over the house. The sense of incompleteness terrifies my mother. \"He still had so much left to do,\" she keeps repeating. He used to say that each figure was embedded in the piece of wood he chipped, he only brought it out. But the Madonnas and Christs, with their African features, rarely sold. \"He was ahead of his time,\" my mother would say. He worked in a factory, leaving the house in the dark and returning home at night to sculpt and paint and write. \"He had to work too hard. They killed him,\" my mother adds, \"all those people who couldn't see his work or recognise the beauty of it.\"</p> <p>Looking at my father's work starts to bring too much sadness. I begin to shut it out until it becomes part of the furniture. I tear up a picture he painted of my teddy bear and hide the pieces in a cupboard. In those summer nights, I learn to conceal things.</p> <p>I make myself stop crying in the daytime. I want to be big and strong for my mother. In bed at night, I learn to cry without making any sound while I play back the memories: my father dancing like a bear to make us laugh; my father cooking rice and peas. I also remember when I was four, just before my brother was born. My mother was ill, so my sister and I were sent to stay with friends. In those summer nights, my father would visit after work. He would leave his black corduroy jacket hanging at the foot of my bed so I would sleep. I needed to know he was still there before I could close my eyes. The jacket smelled of wood and paint. Where is it now? If I can find it, maybe he'll come home. I search secretly, but it has gone.</p> <p>\"Daddy's never coming home.\" I try to imagine never. I play the word over and over in my head. It stands beside \"forever\" and \"eternity\"; terrible, powerful words that are impossible to understand even in adulthood. \"You and Lucinda and Tamba must always be like your father,\" my mother says. \"You must write and paint like him.\" My father was a Maroon; he was the carver and storyteller. These roles were passed down the generations. It's up to us now to keep them going.</p> <p>My mother struggles on. My father is always in her thoughts. Their marriage was courageous; an English woman and a Jamaican man fell in love in 1953; they were verbally abused, spat upon, ostracised by many. They had the kind of romantic, passionate love that rarely exists beyond books. She was never to become involved with another man. \"Our happiness was a once-in-a- lifetime thing,\" she would say. Sometimes she'd add: \"We were too happy. I knew it couldn't last.\"</p> <p>She kept a diary. A year after his death, she wrote: \"I feel him so near me today. It was just as though his spirit was everywhere. I had the same peace and security that nothing could touch, that I sometimes had when I was with him, without the fears and the cares of the world crowding in. Everything I do, I try to put him in front of me, to do it because he would want it, or that is how he would do it. I hold his red pullover very tight and this helps to bring him close because I cannot see him.\"</p> <p>I cannot see him either and his jacket is no longer there. He was the Caribbean part of my inheritance and now there are only empty spaces.</p> <p>But slowly, through the months and years, the sadness starts to yield. He begins to come back into view. I start to hear his voice again and the Jamaican words that had been lost to me.</p> <p>There comes a time when I can almost touch his jacket; I can smell the paint and wood. I can see his carvings and I feel my history as I look. There is colour and light in the pictures he painted. I read his books and feel his warmth as I recall the tales he used to tell of ancestral spirits. I look inside myself and I see the part of me that has always wanted to be like him.</p> <p>Summer nights are long. They are full of the comfort of remembering.</p> <p>\u0095 Jacqueline Roy is a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University.

      "bodyText": "It's a summer night and my mother is not in the house. The Lady Who Lives Downstairs is keeping an eye on my brother, sister and me. I am the oldest so I must be calm, even though it feels as if we are alone. I'm too hot, so I kick back the sheet and lie in the dark, aware of the closeness of summer, the stuffiness of the room and my sister's even breathing from the other bed. Soon my mother will be home. It is the time between night and morning and it's deathly quiet with a stillness that makes me still, too, despite my restlessness. I listen for the sound of my mother's key in the lock. \"He'll be back soon,\" my mother said and I've been trying to believe her. I've lain awake, wondering why he hasn't asked to see me. \"Children aren't allowed to visit the grown-up ward,\" my mother tells me. But he can do anything, anything at all. If he wanted me to come, he would make it possible. I keep beating back the fear that he's forgotten me. Or perhaps he knows how naughty I've been. \"You must be good for Mummy,\" he said before he left and I've tried really hard but perhaps I haven't been good enough. \"Is Daddy going to die?\" I asked my mother when she came in one night to see if I was sleeping. \"No, of course not,\" she replied, sounding cross. I waited for the safe feeling her answer should have brought but it wouldn't come. Each long night, I feel the heat of summer. I am seven years old and it's the first time I've been aware of the changing seasons. When it is warm, Daddy plays with us outside; we suck lollies shaped like rockets from the ice cream van. This summer there is sun, but it feels dark. Even the days seem like night. I sit up suddenly. My mother is home. The front door shuts. I run to the top of the stairs and look down at her. Something's wrong. She's crying. I go down slowly, not sure what to do. I wait beside her, wanting her to tell me what is wrong yet fearful of knowing the terrible thing that's made her cry. I reach up to touch her but she pushes me away. I look at her angrily. \"I'm sorry, darling,\" she says and she holds me close but it's too tight, I want it to stop now, she's squashing me. \"Daddy is dead,\" she says, in a distant voice. \"He is never coming home.\" In that moment, everything changes. It is daylight now, but the darkness grows deeper. I am sitting in my father's chair, holding a big handkerchief. My eyes burn. I don't remember coming into the living room and sitting here. When did I start to cry? When will I be able to stop? \"Dead, dead, I hate the word dead!\" I shout, full of childish intensity. I'm trying to behave the way you should when someone dies. A grown-up would say these things and I know I must be grown up now. My sister is sitting on the floor, nursing her doll. We are each alone. From his playpen, my brother asks for cake. My sister and I look at him scornfully. It's much too soon for ordinary things. \"He doesn't understand,\" my mother says. I don't understand either but I know I mustn't say it. I'm not a baby any more. Day slips into night again, the cycles barely noticed. We have no sense of time passing. It is as if we are trapped in a single moment. We may never really move beyond it. All around us, there are pieces of my father: his carvings and paintings, many only half completed, are spread all over the house. The sense of incompleteness terrifies my mother. \"He still had so much left to do,\" she keeps repeating. He used to say that each figure was embedded in the piece of wood he chipped, he only brought it out. But the Madonnas and Christs, with their African features, rarely sold. \"He was ahead of his time,\" my mother would say. He worked in a factory, leaving the house in the dark and returning home at night to sculpt and paint and write. \"He had to work too hard. They killed him,\" my mother adds, \"all those people who couldn't see his work or recognise the beauty of it.\" Looking at my father's work starts to bring too much sadness. I begin to shut it out until it becomes part of the furniture. I tear up a picture he painted of my teddy bear and hide the pieces in a cupboard. In those summer nights, I learn to conceal things. I make myself stop crying in the daytime. I want to be big and strong for my mother. In bed at night, I learn to cry without making any sound while I play back the memories: my father dancing like a bear to make us laugh; my father cooking rice and peas. I also remember when I was four, just before my brother was born. My mother was ill, so my sister and I were sent to stay with friends. In those summer nights, my father would visit after work. He would leave his black corduroy jacket hanging at the foot of my bed so I would sleep. I needed to know he was still there before I could close my eyes. The jacket smelled of wood and paint. Where is it now? If I can find it, maybe he'll come home. I search secretly, but it has gone. \"Daddy's never coming home.\" I try to imagine never. I play the word over and over in my head. It stands beside \"forever\" and \"eternity\"; terrible, powerful words that are impossible to understand even in adulthood. \"You and Lucinda and Tamba must always be like your father,\" my mother says. \"You must write and paint like him.\" My father was a Maroon; he was the carver and storyteller. These roles were passed down the generations. It's up to us now to keep them going. My mother struggles on. My father is always in her thoughts. Their marriage was courageous; an English woman and a Jamaican man fell in love in 1953; they were verbally abused, spat upon, ostracised by many. They had the kind of romantic, passionate love that rarely exists beyond books. She was never to become involved with another man. \"Our happiness was a once-in-a- lifetime thing,\" she would say. Sometimes she'd add: \"We were too happy. I knew it couldn't last.\" She kept a diary. A year after his death, she wrote: \"I feel him so near me today. It was just as though his spirit was everywhere. I had the same peace and security that nothing could touch, that I sometimes had when I was with him, without the fears and the cares of the world crowding in. Everything I do, I try to put him in front of me, to do it because he would want it, or that is how he would do it. I hold his red pullover very tight and this helps to bring him close because I cannot see him.\" I cannot see him either and his jacket is no longer there. He was the Caribbean part of my inheritance and now there are only empty spaces. But slowly, through the months and years, the sadness starts to yield. He begins to come back into view. I start to hear his voice again and the Jamaican words that had been lost to me. There comes a time when I can almost touch his jacket; I can smell the paint and wood. I can see his carvings and I feel my history as I look. There is colour and light in the pictures he painted. I read his books and feel his warmth as I recall the tales he used to tell of ancestral spirits. I look inside myself and I see the part of me that has always wanted to be like him. Summer nights are long. They are full of the comfort of remembering. \u0095 Jacqueline Roy is a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University.

      "bodyText": "At one time they were like ghosts, disembarking at night and hidden in the mountains by the time dawn revealed their footprints on the beach. Sunbathers might find plastic bags of soggy bread and soiled clothes, but uninvited entry into the first world was generally discreet. They were Moroccans who had crossed the Gibraltar strait to southern Spain. Capture meant instant deportation, so on sight of the police they fled into the upland pine forests and cacti. After a few days they would fan north and try to melt into the economies of Spain and northern Europe. This summer something has changed. Thousands of sub-Saharan Africans have started following the Moroccans into overloaded dinghies for the two-hour moonlit ride. Staggering ashore are asylum seekers and immigrants from Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Senegal. Unlike the Moroccans they do not run. They sit, or collapse, on the beach or motorway and wait to be picked up. Police around the town of Tarifa, Spain's southernmost tip, have intercepted more than 600 people in the past 10 days alone - an unprecedented rate of entry which shows no sign of slowing. The infrastructure to receive them is crumbling. A sports stadium is being used to supplement overflowing police cells. Stocks of shoes and clothes are running out. The arrivals are processed en masse rather than individually. The explanation is simple: Fortress Europe has shut one door, so the illegals are using another. Prompted by its European Union partners, Spain has sealed off Ceuta and Melilla, its two enclaves on the Moroccan coast which for years attracted sub-Saharans fleeing poverty and oppression. New fences ringed with razor wires, infra-red cameras and police patrols redirect the sub-Saharan traffic into the 12-mile Gibraltar strait. The strait is so narrow that car headlights can be seen on the other side, but treacherous currents and winds have claimed an estimated 3,000 lives in the past five years. \"After all we'd been through, we discovered we'd have to take another boat. It was almost too much,\" said Kisley Osas, 22, from Nigeria. With 26 other young men from his village, on June 28 he attached a motor to a fishing boat and started rowing. \"If you saw our lives there you'd understand why. We have nothing,\" he said. Using tyre tubes and air-filled plastic bottles as life-jackets, they stayed within sight of land and took turns rowing. They had hoped to avoid the Gibraltar crossing. \"About halfway across a wave from a tanker or something hit us. We were praying to God. Then a boat with white men in uniform came,\" he said. Maria, 25, and her three-month-old daughter were picked up last week, eight months after she left her Nigerian village to trek across the Sahara. The birth of her daughter, she said, was not easy. \"No professionals, no medicines.\" Other survivors tell of women dying in childbirth, and of companions dying of thirst and disease. Women are routinely raped by bandits and border guards, they say. With their livelihood threatened by civil guard naval patrols, the smugglers have raised the price of the crossing to \u00a31,000. The higher stakes have increased the temptation to overload the inflatable speedboats, called Zodiacs. The smugglers wait for calm weather, then race across in convoys of four or five to overwhelm the civil guards. Their \"clients\" are tossed overboard if a patrol boat approaches. A new route that has opened this summer is the unguarded 60-mile stretch to the Canaries, where surfers have watched as the boatloads of human cargo struggled to shore. The smugglers' tactics will have to become more ingenious - or brutal - in 2004, when Spain finishes installing an \u00a380m radar system that will form a 350-mile electronic wall across the Mediterranean.

Ivan de la Vega, the alleged leader of a smuggling ring that is believed to have shipped almost $3bn of cocaine around the world, and four others are to face drug-trafficking charges in Florida after a multinational law enforcement operation ended with a series of confrontations worthy of a Hollywood movie. Speedboat gun battles, jungle raids and the seizure of a freighter marked the last days of an effort to crack down on a Colombian drugs operation which used a remote location in Venezuela and the global shipping industry to transport cocaine to Europe and the US. In announcing the successful conclusion of Operation Journey on Saturday, Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the US customs service, said: \"We wiped out a sprawling organisation whose tentacles reached around the world.\" He described the organisation, allegedly run by Mr de la Vega from Colombia, as \"one of the largest drug transportation groups ever targeted by law enforcement\". The smuggling operation transported drugs from Colombia by way of the Venezuelan jungle to Europe using a fleet of up to 10 commercial freighters. Among those arrested in the international raids were understood to be several employees of the shipping industry in Europe. Eastern Europe has become more and more involved in drug trafficking since the fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989. US officials said the law-enforcement effort, which involved 12 countries, reflected the greater willingness of international agencies to work together to crack down on an increasingly global trade. Mr Kelly said in Washington that Operation Journey provided a \"powerful new blueprint for fighting the international drug trade\". There was particular praise for the Venezuelan authorities, who seized nearly 10 tonnes of cocaine in the country's sparsely populated Orinoco river delta last week.

Sounds more kaftans than kipper ties. \"Guy was keen on nature,\" his pal continues, \"and at one time considered becoming a gamekeeper.\" Aha! So the obsession with guns and violence is long-standing? Earlier this year, the father of Madonna's second child was arrested for allegedly beating up a fan outside their Kensington home - but he maintains in public that \"I fucking disapprove of violence.\" Papa don't preach, I should say. Touch\u00e9. So why's this mockney geezer in the news? His new film, the maturely titled Snatch, starring Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones, is released this week. Is it about boxers, gangsters and thieves up to no good within earshot of the Bow bells? How did you guess? Most likely to say: \"Stone me!\" Least likely to say: \"Spiffing!\" Not to be confused with: Richie Rich, Damon Albarn, Dick van Dyke.",

      "bodyText": "UN aid workers have warned that heavy fighting in Afghanistan is hampering efforts to help up to 4m people who have been seriously affected by the country's worst drought in 30 years. Roads into some of the worst hit areas pass through military frontlines and are heavily mined or blocked. Last week the World Food Programme made the first delivery of 400 tonnes of wheat and seven tonnes of other food to Dara-e-Souf, near Samangan in the north. Children in the area are severely malnourished and some are eating roots and wild plants to survive. The worsening conditions may force 100,000 people in the area from their homes and create a food crisis by the winter, said Michael Semple, the UN coordinator for the region. Deliveries of another 15,000 tonnes of food needed in Dara-e-Souf will not get through unless roads are opened, he said. \"If they open roads a famine will not happen.\" The road used by the convoy is heavily mined and will be come blocked by heavy winter snow within three months. \"The problem will become acute when it becomes cold. People are waiting for a good winter rain. Otherwise the scale of disaster would be tough,\" Mr Semple said. The severe drought covers a broad stretch of land from western Pakistan through Afghanistan into Iran and north into central Asia. Crops across Afghanistan have been destroyed and nomadic herders have lost their animals. At least 2.3m tonnes of extra food will be needed in the country this year to make up for the effects of the drought, according to the UN. Refugees are expected to flood into neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. The problem in Afghanistan is being complicated by a new outbreak of heavy fighting between the Islamic Taliban militia, who control most of the country, and forces from the ousted government. Dara-e-Souf is still held by former government fighters who have held out against the Taliban for four years. \"The area was badly affected by the drought and by the war and it was a cross-line operation,\" said Mr Semple. \"On one side was the Taliban and on the other the opposition.\" In the past month the Taliban, a movement of religious students who seized Kabul in 1996, has led an offensive into the north, taking new ground and closing in on Taloqan, the administrative headquarters of the ousted government. The Taliban's reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, said the drought was divine punishment for those who were not praying regularly and who failed to support the Islamic regime. Alongside its latest military offensive, the Taliban has launched a new campaign to demand international recognition for its regime and prevent further sanctions. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates recognise the Taliban, while the ousted government still holds the country's seat at the UN in New York. \"Have mercy on the people of Afghanistan and give the United Nations seat to the true representatives of the people of Afghanistan whom the people like and support,\" the Taliban ambassador to Islamabad, Maulvi Mohammad Saeed Haqqani, said last week. \"Do not impose sanctions and bring more miseries for the people of Afghanistan.\" The UN security council imposed financial and aviation sanctions on the Taliban regime in November and has threatened to introduce an arms embargo unless the latest round of fighting stops. But a report from the UN office which provides aid in the country has warned that Afghanistan is too vulnerable to face economic sanctions, and that most people are already surviving at near subsistence levels.",

He also feared that the media was being manipulated by organised crime - a view echoed by the embattled interior minister.</p> <p>Mr Pinter - one of those named by Mr Nogradi - has suggested that the media have been infiltrated, with cars given to certain journalists as gifts. Mr Nogradi's most damaging interview was broadcast by the commercial channel, RTL Klub, which denies any such connections. Mr Nogradi also denies these allegations.</p> <p>The public prosecutor, Peter Polt, now has a staff of 10 working full-time on the case.

It came into Hungary in vast quantities by train, mainly from Romania and Russia. To prevent its resale as diesel, a red dye was added to each wagon. But when supervising customs officers left, sulphuric acid was added, causing the red colouring to disappear - the so-called \"blonding\". Another chemical then caused the sulphuric acid to evaporate. According to official estimates, the economy has lost \u00a3220m and the scam may be continuing. When the import tax on heating oil was increased to the same level as diesel, \"mixing\" began. Various oil-based lubricants, each with a low import duty, were brought into the country, adulterated and resold. Former Hungarian secret agents from the communist era are believed to have set up illegal businesses with their former colleagues from the KGB. The resulting criminal networks have proved extremely hard for the new police forces to crack. The mafia are alleged to have bribed police officers, especially in Bekes county in south-eastern Hungary, bordering Romania, where the oil scandal originated. \"I still hope that the whole truth will be uncovered,\" a member of the parliamentary ad-hoc committee, the Hungarian Democratic Forum MP Laszlo Balogh, told the Guardian yesterday. \"What has already been achieved is that no member of the oil-mafia can sleep peacefully.\" He said the case had eroded public confidence in top officials. \"The population has been made to believe that ministers are untrustworthy,\" he said, citing in particular Mr Nogradi's testimony, which he alleged was concocted by sources connected to the oil mafia. Mr Balogh said that none of the documents which he had read had supported the allegations. He also feared that the media was being manipulated by organised crime - a view echoed by the embattled interior minister. Mr Pinter - one of those named by Mr Nogradi - has suggested that the media have been infiltrated, with cars given to certain journalists as gifts. Mr Nogradi's most damaging interview was broadcast by the commercial channel, RTL Klub, which denies any such connections. Mr Nogradi also denies these allegations. The public prosecutor, Peter Polt, now has a staff of 10 working full-time on the case. Last week he told a special session of parliament debating the oil affair that he had quashed investigations into leading officials for lack of evidence.",

Homophone corner: just another month, said the Finance Notebook, page 31, August 25, and Sir Richard Branson should land the lottery of his dreams: \"Queue the dewy eyes and the perma-grin.\" Nice, but cue correction. Page 1, the Listings, in our Clearing 2000 education supplement, August 18, said one reason for the declining popularity of language degrees was that fees often had to be found for four years, one spent abroad. To clarify, some courses entail full fees for the year abroad, some a proportion, and others (eg the Erasmus programme) no fees. In a feature on Naples, page 4, Travel, August 19, it was inferred from an incident involving a cafe receipt that a police operation was in progress against possible gangster racketeering. In fact, police monitoring of such receipts is standard in Italy, the object being to ensure cafes pay their taxes in full. A reader had doubts when an article headed Albatross faces extinction, Page 9, August 17, said that the largest of the species - the wandering albatross - could fly at up to 100mph. The bird's normal speed is 40-60mph; it can hit 100mph in a steep dive. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible. Please quote the date and page number.

      "byline": "Tony Thorndike",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In January 1967, when the Bahamas was still a British colony, the black population of Nassau, New Providence, and of the other 700 or so islands of the far-flung archipelago, danced with delight as the news seeped through of a famous election victory. By a whisker, black majority rule had arrived.</p> <p>The stranglehold on power of the entrenched white elite, the so-called \"Bay Street Boys\" (named after Nassau's main business street), had been broken. For three centuries, they had dominated commercial and political life, and had been the mainstay of the \"colour bar\" that controlled most areas of Bahamian life.</p> <p>The man responsible for this historic electoral win was Sir Lynden Pindling, leader of the Bahamas for 25 years - both before and after its independence in 1973 - known as \"Black Moses\", who has died aged 70. Always ready to use robust language to denounce first, British colonialism, and later, American imperialism as the political occasion demanded, he deployed his considerable charm to court British, European and American investment and business activity.</p> <p>Most Bahamians overlooked his dictatorial manner (often accompanied by intense staring through a slow eye) and questionable business deals, as he transformed the prospects of his fellow blacks. By the time he was voted out of office, in 1992, GNP per capita was $12,000, second only to the Caymans in the English-speaking Caribbean.</p> <p>The son of a retired policeman, he did well enough at school to go to London university, from where he graduated with a law degree in 1952. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in early 1953 and to the Bahamian Bar in the following August. On his return home, he joined the minority black-led Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which had been only recently formed.</p> <p>He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1956 on a limited franchise and unremittingly campaigned for universal suffrage, always delayed by the white elite. Male universal suffrage was conceded in 1962, when older women also got the vote.</p> <p>Contrary to expectations, the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which had been created by the white elite to counter the PLP, won the 1962 elections, although the PLP polled a majority of votes. Crisis gripped the PLP leadership and Pindling became leader soon after. His platform was to insist on constitutional advancement, and universal suffrage for both sexes came in 1964. Despite growing prosperity, the British government reserved considerable powers to itself, and this provided a further target for Pindling.</p> <p>At the 1967 election, he switched his electoral base from New Providence to Kemp's Bay, Andros Island, where accusations of corruption against members of the UBP, vigorous PLP campaigning and support from the sole representative of the Negro Labour Party resulted in Pindling becoming premier. Shock waves rippled through the Bahamas. Racial strife and economic collapse were predicted. In fact, the white elite soon learned they could live with a PLP government, which was similarly interested in promoting business, tourism and offshore finance.</p> <p>Almost at once, Pindling insisted on constitutional change: the Assembly was dissolved and an election called in 1968 to ensure a mandate for change, which returned the PLP to power. Independence followed five years later. Thereafter, Pindling led the PLP to win five successive elections. The UBP collapsed and it took years of confusion before the Free National Movement (FNM) eventually emerged as the opposition party. Pindling paid particular attention to immigration, in the hope that black Bahamians would benefit. Yet successive clampdowns on illegal Haitian immigrants and strict work permit rules for (mainly white) expatriates had unforeseen effects. Wages rose, but not in line with skills.</p> <p>Despite impressive industrial and other development, notably at Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, black (especially youth) unemployment stubbornly remained and investment was often being directed at capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive projects.</p> <p>By the late 1970s, the Bahamas had become associated with drug trafficking and money laundering, being en route between south America and the United States. The FNM eventually focused on narcotic-related corruption in the PLP ministerial ranks. In 1983 - the year he was knighted - Pindling was accused in a US television programme of involvement in drug trafficking and was forced to launch a royal commission to investigate the claims against himself and the PLP. The commission found against several ministers but Pindling was cleared, although the report noted that his expenditure was eight times his declared income.</p> <p>Confronted by an angry US government which threatened sanctions against the Bahamas, Pindling had to grant US law enforcement officials diplomatic immunity and free passage through the archipelago, plus access to the criminal secrets of offshore banks.</p> <p>Gradually, the offshore industry was cleaned up. In 1985 a joint US-Bahamian operation in Bimini netted an incredible 34,000 tonnes of marijuana and 2,500 tonnes of processed cocaine .</p> <p>Pindling sought political vengeance for his humiliation. The FNM opposition had urged cooperation with Washington. In the 1987 election campaign, he played both nationalist and racial cards to good effect. His opponents, he said, were traitors, concerned only to appease US and white interests and to degrade the black populace. The FNM was trounced and its leadership demoralised. But change was in the air. Former PLP minister Hubert Ingraham emerged as FNM leader and his party's image became more black-orientated.</p> <p>By the early 1990s, the black population in New Providence in particular was severely affected by recession; then another scandal broke over the state-owned airline, Bahamasair, and the Pindling-headed Bahamas Hotel Corporation.

      "bodyText": "In January 1967, when the Bahamas was still a British colony, the black population of Nassau, New Providence, and of the other 700 or so islands of the far-flung archipelago, danced with delight as the news seeped through of a famous election victory. By a whisker, black majority rule had arrived. The stranglehold on power of the entrenched white elite, the so-called \"Bay Street Boys\" (named after Nassau's main business street), had been broken. For three centuries, they had dominated commercial and political life, and had been the mainstay of the \"colour bar\" that controlled most areas of Bahamian life. The man responsible for this historic electoral win was Sir Lynden Pindling, leader of the Bahamas for 25 years - both before and after its independence in 1973 - known as \"Black Moses\", who has died aged 70. Always ready to use robust language to denounce first, British colonialism, and later, American imperialism as the political occasion demanded, he deployed his considerable charm to court British, European and American investment and business activity. Most Bahamians overlooked his dictatorial manner (often accompanied by intense staring through a slow eye) and questionable business deals, as he transformed the prospects of his fellow blacks. By the time he was voted out of office, in 1992, GNP per capita was $12,000, second only to the Caymans in the English-speaking Caribbean. The son of a retired policeman, he did well enough at school to go to London university, from where he graduated with a law degree in 1952. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in early 1953 and to the Bahamian Bar in the following August. On his return home, he joined the minority black-led Progressive Liberal Party (PLP), which had been only recently formed. He was elected to the House of Assembly in 1956 on a limited franchise and unremittingly campaigned for universal suffrage, always delayed by the white elite. Male universal suffrage was conceded in 1962, when older women also got the vote. Contrary to expectations, the United Bahamian Party (UBP), which had been created by the white elite to counter the PLP, won the 1962 elections, although the PLP polled a majority of votes. Crisis gripped the PLP leadership and Pindling became leader soon after. His platform was to insist on constitutional advancement, and universal suffrage for both sexes came in 1964. Despite growing prosperity, the British government reserved considerable powers to itself, and this provided a further target for Pindling. At the 1967 election, he switched his electoral base from New Providence to Kemp's Bay, Andros Island, where accusations of corruption against members of the UBP, vigorous PLP campaigning and support from the sole representative of the Negro Labour Party resulted in Pindling becoming premier. Shock waves rippled through the Bahamas. Racial strife and economic collapse were predicted. In fact, the white elite soon learned they could live with a PLP government, which was similarly interested in promoting business, tourism and offshore finance. Almost at once, Pindling insisted on constitutional change: the Assembly was dissolved and an election called in 1968 to ensure a mandate for change, which returned the PLP to power. Independence followed five years later. Thereafter, Pindling led the PLP to win five successive elections. The UBP collapsed and it took years of confusion before the Free National Movement (FNM) eventually emerged as the opposition party. Pindling paid particular attention to immigration, in the hope that black Bahamians would benefit. Yet successive clampdowns on illegal Haitian immigrants and strict work permit rules for (mainly white) expatriates had unforeseen effects. Wages rose, but not in line with skills. Despite impressive industrial and other development, notably at Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, black (especially youth) unemployment stubbornly remained and investment was often being directed at capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive projects. By the late 1970s, the Bahamas had become associated with drug trafficking and money laundering, being en route between south America and the United States. The FNM eventually focused on narcotic-related corruption in the PLP ministerial ranks. In 1983 - the year he was knighted - Pindling was accused in a US television programme of involvement in drug trafficking and was forced to launch a royal commission to investigate the claims against himself and the PLP. The commission found against several ministers but Pindling was cleared, although the report noted that his expenditure was eight times his declared income. Confronted by an angry US government which threatened sanctions against the Bahamas, Pindling had to grant US law enforcement officials diplomatic immunity and free passage through the archipelago, plus access to the criminal secrets of offshore banks. Gradually, the offshore industry was cleaned up. In 1985 a joint US-Bahamian operation in Bimini netted an incredible 34,000 tonnes of marijuana and 2,500 tonnes of processed cocaine . Pindling sought political vengeance for his humiliation. The FNM opposition had urged cooperation with Washington. In the 1987 election campaign, he played both nationalist and racial cards to good effect. His opponents, he said, were traitors, concerned only to appease US and white interests and to degrade the black populace. The FNM was trounced and its leadership demoralised. But change was in the air. Former PLP minister Hubert Ingraham emerged as FNM leader and his party's image became more black-orientated. By the early 1990s, the black population in New Providence in particular was severely affected by recession; then another scandal broke over the state-owned airline, Bahamasair, and the Pindling-headed Bahamas Hotel Corporation. In the 1992 election, the PLP was decisively defeated. As leader of the opposition, Pindling fought a long rearguard action against inquiries involving his business affairs. Despite his legal difficulties, he gained comfort from the knowledge that the political magic associated with \"Black Moses\" remained very much alive. His offer to resign after the 1992 election was refused by the PLP rank and file, who revered him to the end. He is survived by his wife, the former Marguerite McKenzie of Andros, and by his two sons and two daughters. Sir Lynden Oscar Pindling, politician, born March 22 1930; died August 26 2000",

      "body": "<p>Henry Wilfred \"Bunny\" Austin, the most admirable failure in the history of British tennis, has died on his 94th birthday. Though in age he had hoped that Tim Henman might replace him, he still remained the last male British competitor to reach the finals at Wimbledon. Fred Perry won (for the third year running) in 1936; Austin lost in 1932 and 1938. At least he got there, and twice. He was also the man who introduced shorts to the game.</p> <p>Austin enjoyed an idyllic middle-class childhood before the first world war. He lived with his parents and sister Phyllis in a large house with servants in South Norwood. He was nicknamed Bunny after a rabbit in a comic-strip called Wilfred. So keen was his father (whose own nickname was Wolf), that his son should become a sportsman that he seized the newborn infant from the doctor to check that his limbs were sound. Bunny accommodated these expectations at the earliest possible moment: he practised hitting tennis balls against his nursery wall, and joined Norhurst Tennis Club at the age of six.</p> <p>At Repton School, he played for the cricket team, but tennis was his passion, and in 1921 he won the under-16 singles in the public schoolboys' tournament at Queen's. The following year he won the junior championships in the singles, doubles and mixed doubles, and in 1923 again won singles and doubles in the public schoolboys' tournament.</p> <p>He had similar successes in 1924 and 1925: he representing England against America at Eastbourne, winning the Cambridge university singles, and reaching the men's doubles semi-finals in his first year at Wimbledon in 1926, all while still an undergraduate. Altogether, Austin reached the Wimbledon quarter- finals, or beyond, 10 times. Unseeded in 1929, he reached the semi-finals, losing to Jean Borotra of France. He was ranked ninth in the world by the year's end, and was seeded sixth at Wimbledon for the following three years.</p> <p>In 1932, Austin, aged 25, dropped just three sets en route to his first finals - he was the first Englishman to reach them for a decade - only to be overwhelmed by the American Ellsworth Vines in three sets. Sixty-six years later, as a generous-minded and gracious nonagenarian, he recalled this defeat for the Guardian's Frank Keating in the nursing-home where he spent his last years: \"Ellsworth wiped me off the court in 50 minutes. I was annihilated. It was 6-4, 6-2, 6-0 and he won the match with an ace.\"</p> <p>Austin bounced back in 1933, was seeded fourth and reached the quarter-final, going out to Japan's Jiro Satoh. As Austin recalled: \"It was the year I invented shorts. I found sweat-sodden cricket flannels were weighing me down, so my tailor ran up some prototype shorts.\" He also had his revenge on Vines, beating him 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in Paris in the Davis Cup zone final. He and Fred Perry were national heroes, carried shoulder-high by cheering crowds on their return to Victoria Station.</p> <p>Austin was used to such celebrity. In 1931 he had married actress Phyllis Konstam. She is now remembered only by a few avid Hitchcock film buffs, for roles in his 1928 silent comedy Champagne, his early, stodgy British talkie The Skin Game and his 1930 film, Murder. At the time, Konstam was feted and beautiful, Austin was a pin-up, and theirs was a celebrity wedding of 1931. They had met on a Cunard liner two years earlier as Austin was heading for the US Open at Forest Hills (in which he reached the last eight).</p> <p>This gilded couple knew a galaxy of famous people; Bunny was a friend of Daphne du Maurier, Ronald Coleman and Michael, King of Romania, and he played tennis socially with Charlie Chaplin and the Queen of Thailand. (He found himself shouting \"Run, your Majesty, run!\" when they played doubles.) He met Queen Mary and President Roosevelt, and the future President Kennedy told him he had been a fan. The tennis ace Suzanne Lenglen insisted he play doubles with her.</p> <p>At Wimbledon, Bunny's mixed doubles partners were Betty Nuthall and Joan Lycett, and, in 1934, Dorothy Shepherd Barron, with whom he reached the finals (a 0-6 third set defeat). In the men's doubles he never played again after his second round defeat of 1931, partnered by Charles Kingsley.</p> <p>In the singles, however, he reached the quarter-finals year after year, peaking in 1935 with a respectable four-set defeat by Donald Budge, one of the game's all-time greats. It would be the longest Wimbledon singles match Budge ever played. That year, Austin was a semi-finalist in the French Championship and defeated Budge and Allison in the challenge round of the Davis Cup, which he and Perry were instrumental in retaining for Britain.</p> <p>Seeded seventh, Bunny reached the semi-finals once again in 1936, going out to the German von Cramm, and the following year, now the British No 1, he repeated this result against the same opponent. He also reached the finals of the French.</p> <p>In 1938 he met Budge again, this time in the Wimbledon final. He won only four games. \"Donald was unstoppable that afternoon,\" Austin remembered half a century on - adding, characteristically: \"He was a true great. It was an honour just to be on the same court.\" The following year was Austin's last as a Wimbledon competitor. Seeded No 1, he went out to the American sixth seed Elwood Cooke in straight sets, after beating future champion (and future Briton) Jaroslav Drobny in round three.</p> <p>It was not the end of the story. Despite their celebrity and famous friends, Bunny and Phyllis had been drawn toward the Oxford Group and Moral Rearmament, and worked for this cause from the early 1930s; during the war, they went to America to promote it. Peter Ustinov, who knew Austin, wrote that he was \"disgracefully ostracised by the All-England Club because he was a conscientious objector\". Austin had been a Club member since 1925, yet on his return to Britain in 1961, he was told his membership had \"been lapsed\". They restored it when he was 77 years old; Austin noted: \"In 1984, 40 years after getting rid of me, they suddenly let me back in and [were] all very nice to me.\"</p> <p>Austin, whose autobiography A Mixed Double was published in 1969, and his wife devoted the rest of their lives to Moral Rearmament, travelling the world to promote the cause. They were particularly involved in the MRA's Westminster Theatre, where a production about their life, Love All, was staged.</p> <p>Phyllis died in 1976. In 1995, Austin had a serious fall, and entered a nursing home at Coulsdon, Surrey, where he remained, sociable, alert, unembittered and interested in life and in tennis.

I hope it leads to a better deal for the stock exchange, with the Germans or with Nasdaq,\" said Gareth Jones, chief executive of Abbey National's treasury arm. \"I also hope the stock exchange will be more open with its shareholders.\" The announcement of the bid by OM prompted calls yesterday for the London exchange to give more details about any other bids it has received, widely believed to have come from a European alliance led by the Paris Borse and also from Nasdaq. The London exchange would say little yesterday, other than to \"welcome\" the support it had received from its German partner, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The German exchange indicated over the weekend that it would be prepared to alter the merger terms if it were able to prevent OM taking over the London exchange. After failing to win agreement for its offer from the London exchange's management last week, OM is expected to approach the exchange's shareholders directly in an attempt to win support for its \u00a327 per share offer, which is also expected to be increased. \u0095 Per Larsson, the 39-year-old chief executive of OM Gruppen, has kept a low profile since launching his audacious bid for the London Stock Exchange. Other than describing the London exchange's plan to merge with its German rival as \"flawed\" and expressing his determination to offer a better alternative, Mr Larsson has said nothing. No doubt gagged by his banking advisers at Lazards ahead of his widely expected approach direct to the London exchange's shareholders this week, Mr Larsson and OM Gruppen have barely registered in the City before now. Backed by the wealthy Wallenberg family, OM was set up 1985 and has a stock market listing in Stockholm, where it is based, and a market value of \u00a32.5bn. Almost 10 years ago, it set up a derivatives exchange in London, called OMLX, and also trades electicity. It also provides the trading systems used by a number of exchanges around the world, including those in Hong Kong, Australia and the US as well as owning Stockholm's stock exchange. This year, OM's biggest step into the international arena was made when it set up Jiway, an electronic market, with US investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. In the past, Mr Larsson has scorned the idea of mergers and alliances between exchanges to form a pan European stock market like the one intended by the Anglo-German alliance. Instead, he has predicted that technology will be driving force. This may explain why thrust of OM's approach to the London Stock Exchange is understood to be based on the quality of its technology - an area which has caused repeated problems for London.",

'That's what they'll go for' Charlton are close to finalising a \u00a31m deal with Tivoli Gardens for long-time target Ricardo Fuller Gianluca Vialli has laughed off reports of a late Chelsea bid to scupper Steve McManaman's move to Middlesbrough - 'He is an excellent player, but we have enough of those' Colin Hendry is set to quit Coventry after being told he no longer has a guaranteed first-team spot Birmingham's move for Derby's Dean Sturridge has stalled after Trevor Francis decided to eye up some other targets. 'I know what we want,' says Francis. 'but you cannot sign players on their name alone' Everton could move again for Italian icon Roberto Baggio - Walter Smith still wants cover up front despite landing Duncan Ferguson. Gazza, meanwhile, has tipped himself for an England recall Ipswich could spend again - George Burley's still chasing Southampton's Hassan Kachloul Peter Risdale says Leeds fans won't stop emailing him: 'I've had lots of emails from fans urging me to spend money' Leicester have offered wantaway Tony Cottee to QPR; Liverpool could beat Leicester to sign Wigan keeper Roy Carroll Man City are ready to pay \u00a31m for Ecuadorian trialist Ulises de la Cruz Teddy Sheringham could stay even longer at Manchester United after Alex Ferguson offered him a new one-year deal - 'Teddy is one of those rare players who can continue long after others have retired,' says Fergie Middlesbrough's Brian Deane is a target for Celtic - Martin O'Neill has \u00a33m to spend on a striker Newcastle have blocked another Arsenal move for Kieron Dyer - Ars\u00e8ne Wenger had offered an \u00a38m package Southampton are ready to sell striker James Beattie to Crystal Palace for \u00a32m, but David Howells has been forced to quit through injury Sunderland could sell Jody Craddock to Portsmouth after all - Peter Reid has reduced his \u00a31.8m asking price Spurs could make a late bid for Steve McManaman - Ernesto Bronchetti claims the England man 'has important offers from almost all of English soccer' West Ham's Harry Redknapp says his summer transfer spending has finished: 'We can't buy until we sell, and I'm not going to sell.' david.hills@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>English football is going backwards. This summer no great player has signed for an English club and there are no new big stars. Where is the new Eric Cantona, Dennis Bergkamp, Gianfranco Zola or David Ginola? Thanks to them, English football improved, but now Cantona is gone and the others - who remain the big attractions in England - are old. If English football wants to improve again it needs players of quality at their peak. A young Bergkamp, not a thirtysomething Boksic. </p> <p>Redondo and Veron prefer to play in the South of Europe not only because the food and the weather are more appealing. The Premiership has become less attractive than before because it is standing still. What is more, if you want to attract young technical players you must protect them. </p> <p>To focus on Patrick Vieira is to avoid talking about the real problems of refereeing in England. In my opinion, it is the poorest in Europe because it is so inconsistent. I've watched some games where the referee is in control and talks a lot to the players, and others where there is no sensitivity and a lot of rash bookings. You can understand the players' frustration when somebody is punished for an innocuous challenge and the next day on television you see a dangerous tackle and the referee waves play on. Roy Keane was sent off in the Charity Shield for a terrible tackle, but I have seen that kind of thing go unpunished before in English football. I remember when Ian Wright could have broken Peter Schmeichel's leg with a moment of pure aggression but stayed on the field. </p> <p> Sometimes I'm horrified when I see the brutal tackles that litter the Premiership. They are impossible in France, Spain or Italy. Football is too violent in England, but it is part of the culture. The crowd like men who fight, who try to win the ball with physical intensity, and fans applaud a great tackle - a reaction that doesn't exist in Mediterranean leagues. But the problem is that when it is done by a British player it is a fantastic challenge, yet when it is Vieira or Hamann it is a reckless foul. </p> <p>Feeling victimised by referees was not the only reason Emmanuel Petit left the Premiership, but when you watch matches in Spain you see players can actually play football. They can pass, move, run, dribble. Look at Valencia, Barcelona and Real Madrid in last season's Champions League. Technicians like Raul, Redondo, Mendieta and Figo are fantastic players who have the space and atmosphere to play football without a fight. David Beckham would improve if he played in Spain because he would have more freedom. </p> <p>Sometimes players get tired of fighting. Vieira is a great player and it's normal for lesser players to provoke him, but in fairness he has to learn to stop using his elbows. He can avoid that. Raul, for example, has his shirt pulled regularly but he manages to wait for the free-kick rather than react. Vieira is not a perfect French angel, but he is not a hooligan. If you know him he is a well-balanced, kind man. The shame is that he really loves English football - but six red cards in four years? </p> <p>I expect he will stay this season because he won't abandon Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, but in the summer he might feel the time is right to leave. Every big club in Italy wants him. It would be detrimental to English football if he left. You would end up with games contested by British players and bad Europeans. A drain of premium talent, coupled with the unimpressive state of the national team, means England is at least five years behind the top echelons of European football.</p>",

Shay Trainor, part of Mel Stein's iron-grip on the North-West, has been appointed boss of Timperley Bigshorts, a Manchester Amateur League side founded by comic Frank Sidebottom (right). 'Shay started with us as a player a couple of seasons ago,' says club secretary Simon Heywood. 'We promoted him from within. Being an agent, he's brought us loads of perks: a free Italian-made team strip via George Weah's agent, an under-16 Georgian international - Busco Cardone - who's now in Holland after playing a couple of times for us, Nike kit at cost price and hopefully he'll get some of his clients down here to take training soon. Jonathan Greening's quite keen.' Timperley's season begins next Sunday. Before then, Trainor's also planning visits from Wes Brown and Nicky Weaver, plus a fund-raising bash at a local pub with - he hopes - Weah as compere. And Trainor has already identified the first Timperley player who could make it into the big time. 'We've got the world kick-boxing champion here, Johnny Roye, who Shay reckons could play Third Division football if he put his mind to it. But he'll be here for a while - we only finished sixth last year, but this year we're going for it.'

Sergei Khusainov, deported with three colleagues after landing at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport in a stupor the day before he was due to officiate Haifa v Club Bruges, initially claimed he had been set up by Russian enemies, 'who couldn't wait to see me sacked'. Now, though, a year on, he's keen to let it drop - particularly given recurring allegations that he molested a female police officer in the same incident before being hauled away after starting a song-and-dance routine . 'Please, don't think of me as such a big drinker,' he told the Sport-Express newspaper last week. 'Yes, I drank just like everybody else. I could drink a lot and after that I could get behind the wheel and easily drive home past all the police checkpoints. But this incident has hit me very hard. Now that's it. I won't drink a single drop, ever again.' He's still sure, though, that someone spiked his drinks. All of them. 'I still know who did this,' he said. 'It was a planned action, led from Moscow. I still cannot believe it happened. This would have been my last year because of the age limit,' he said. 'To finish like this , it really hurts.' </p> <p><strong>Fan power goes glossy</strong> </p> <p>The National Federation of Football Supporters' Clubs have launched a new glossy magazine to strengthen their 'Fans Charter' campaign, and are giving it away free to fans at grounds across the country.

One good chance for an equaliser came after 49 minutes, when a Steven McConalogue header was pushed on to the bar by the Dunfermline keeper, Marco Ruitenbeek. This was followed by the miss of the match, from David Hannah. The midfielder looked certain to score when he raced in unmarked to connect with a McConalogue cross. But, despite being only four yards out, he made a hash of his header and the ball went wide. Among other particularly exciting goals yesterday were the two in St Johnstone's 1-1 draw against Kilmarnock. A match which had resembled a game of chess was brought to life in the first half when Tommy Lovenkrands gave St Johnstone the lead with an explosive long-range strike - with Andy McLaren equalising with a similar effort just 40 seconds later. Kilmarnock should have gone on to win in the second half. Alan Mahlood hit the woodwork with a diving header, and that irrepressible veteran Ally McCoist did likewise with a cheeky curling shot from 50 yards out.",

Sullivan was obliged to save from Keiron Dyer just after an hour, then managed to thwart Shearer again by intercepting a Nolberto Solano cross as the striker waited for a far post tap-in. </p> <p>At least Shearer had the satisfaction of seeing Cordone swoop on the rebound for the goal that settled the game, but he was less delighted four minutes later when, with Sullivan out of his area, Solano wastefully went for glory from 40 yards out with his captain again unmarked in the area. </p> <p>'If you play well at home you should collect the points,' a satisfied Bobby Robson remarked.

Spurs put in the usual bright 10 minutes immediately after the interval, and in fairness were unlucky to see shots in quick succession by Oyvind Leonhardsen and Steffen Freund cleared off the line by Barton and Hughes respectively, but faded all too predictably once Newcastle regathered their forward momentum. Shearer's moment almost came on 56 minutes when Perry fouled Cordone on the edge of his area, but though his firmly struck free kick beat the wall and had Sullivan stretching, it curled just the wrong side of the upright. Sullivan was obliged to save from Keiron Dyer just after an hour, then managed to thwart Shearer again by intercepting a Nolberto Solano cross as the striker waited for a far post tap-in. At least Shearer had the satisfaction of seeing Cordone swoop on the rebound for the goal that settled the game, but he was less delighted four minutes later when, with Sullivan out of his area, Solano wastefully went for glory from 40 yards out with his captain again unmarked in the area. 'If you play well at home you should collect the points,' a satisfied Bobby Robson remarked. 'I was delighted with our back four.' He must have been quite pleased with the Spurs back four as well.",

Nwankwo Kanu and Robert Pires both had a pair of chances in the opening 15 minutes but failed to take them. Even on the rare occasions Charlton attacked, Arsenal looked the more likely to score on the break. </p> <p>They made spectacular amends for their profligacy. Kanu picked the ball up 35 yards out, skipped past a defender, passed the ball through to... guess who?... Vieira and, cool as you like, he did a little shimmy before chipping the ball into the net. A wonderful goal. Highbury got quite carried away with the symbolism of it. Vieira had scored before he had been booked. Before anyone had been booked. </p> <p>Game over, one thought. Then, an innocuous cross by Radistan Kishishev eluded Martin Keown and Tony Adams and Andy Hunt scored from close range. </p> <p>Charlton, thanks to the diligent efforts of Mark Kinsella and Claus Jensen in the centre of midfield, edged themselves back into the game. On the half-hour, they took the lead. John Robinson's hopeful cross from mid-way down the left hung in the air long enough for Hunt to shrug off a feeble challenge from Silvinho and loop a very slow header past David Seaman. It was Andy Hunt 2, Arsenal 1. And not a referee or linesman or fourth official to blame. </p> <p>Perhaps Seaman must shoulder some of it. He wasn't directly responsible, but his marked unwillingness to come off his line seems to have rendered his defence suddenly very dodgy on the six-yard line. At the very end, he didn't even come for a ball three yards out. </p> <p>Arsenal needed a goal early in the second half. It took less than a minute. Thierry Henry received the ball towards the edge of the Arsenal area, teed it up and casually volleyed it into the net. Back came Charlton. Kevin Lisbie ran down the left, crossed towards that six-yard line and Graham Stuart snuck in front of Adams to clip the ball into the net. </p> <p>And back came Arsenal. Kanu passed the ball across to Vieira who caroomed the ball into the net from 20 yards. Two red cards, two goals. If he keeps this up he'll be very useful in short bursts. </p> <p>At 3-3, there was everything to play for. The kind of pressure situation when someone might get booked. They were. The impressive Kinsella for a foul on...Vieira. A minute later, Arsenal were ahead when Henry skipped through and beat Dean Kiely from a tight angle. Seven goals, 25 minutes to go. 5-5, anyone? </p> <p>Not quite but a minute from time there was another cracker. Silvinho streaming through on the left and stroking the ball into the net. </p> <p>Afterwards, Alan Curbishley talked about his players feeling knackered. He took Kinsella off because he 'was so tired'. His parting words to the press were: 'We've just been beat 5-3 and you're gentle.' Eight goals and a gentle press. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's 'crazy week' had come to the most surprising of ends.</p>",

He told the crowd he would keep his predictions to himself in future, but after watching a game in which Leicester somehow didn't run away with it, privately he must be tempted to make the same bet over again. </p> <p>Only Matt Clarke stood in the way of the Foxes and victory, the home goalkeeper making eight great saves. He left his best until last, an astounding reaction parry from Ade Akinbiyi's close-range effort in the last minute. </p> <p>'He kept us in it, and given the amount of chances they had, this was an excellent point for us,' said manager Chris Hutchings afterwards. Hutchings revealed defender Andy O'Brien had suffered a suspected fractured collar bone after being carried off following an early collision with Akinbiyi. </p> <p>The talk after Tuesday's defeat of Chelsea was that Bradford had somehow acquired a new-found solidity. It wasn't much in evidence here. Granted, new signings such as Peter Atherton, David Hopkin, Ian Nolan and Dan Petrescu, have added confidence to the midfield, but Leicester still penetrated them far too easily. Darren Eadie and Akinbiyi in particular could both have had hat-tricks. </p> <p>With the impish genius of Benito Carbone, Bradford do have a world-class performer, but he often looked isolated here, an artist among artisans.

      "bodyText": "Rodney Marsh had his head shaved before kick-off, after saying Bradford had been 'the worst team he had ever seen in the Premiership' last season and would never stay up. He told the crowd he would keep his predictions to himself in future, but after watching a game in which Leicester somehow didn't run away with it, privately he must be tempted to make the same bet over again. Only Matt Clarke stood in the way of the Foxes and victory, the home goalkeeper making eight great saves. He left his best until last, an astounding reaction parry from Ade Akinbiyi's close-range effort in the last minute. 'He kept us in it, and given the amount of chances they had, this was an excellent point for us,' said manager Chris Hutchings afterwards. Hutchings revealed defender Andy O'Brien had suffered a suspected fractured collar bone after being carried off following an early collision with Akinbiyi. The talk after Tuesday's defeat of Chelsea was that Bradford had somehow acquired a new-found solidity. It wasn't much in evidence here. Granted, new signings such as Peter Atherton, David Hopkin, Ian Nolan and Dan Petrescu, have added confidence to the midfield, but Leicester still penetrated them far too easily. Darren Eadie and Akinbiyi in particular could both have had hat-tricks. With the impish genius of Benito Carbone, Bradford do have a world-class performer, but he often looked isolated here, an artist among artisans. His free role acted as something of a double-edged-sword. He created some marvellous openings in midfield and on the flanks, but when he did there was no one in the middle able to capitalise. Carbone did engineer one effort late on, a stinging shot which Tim Flowers just managed to parry away, but a frustrating season could lie ahead. Leicester are unbeaten and have still not conceded a goal under new manager Peter Taylor. He was disappointed the team had not taken some of the chances but said: 'This was still our best performance of the season, we played well in all positions and all in all, it has been an excellent start to the season.'",

It was end-to-end stuff and the deadlock was nearly broken when Richard Wright, left out of the latest England squad in favour of Aston Villa's David James, tried to punch clear a Kevin Kilbane corner only to skim the ball off his knuckles. Fortunately for Wright, Jamie Clapham was standing behind on the goal line to block the ball back into his keeper's hands. </p> <p>Wright recovered to launch an immediate counter-attack and Bramble was putting Marcus Stewart clear on goal before Sunderland had woken to the danger, although their goalkeeper, Jurgen Macho, was alert and dashed off his line to deny Stewart with his feet. </p> <p>The chances continued to flow and the referee, Graham Poll, who started his season with a hat-trick of red cards at Highbury last Monday, took until the 49th minute to book anyone. But he had no option when Darren Holloway hacked down Fabian Wilnis from behind. The Sunderland manager, Peter Reid, who admitted his team did not deserve anything and criticised their passing, praised Poll, as did Burley. 'I'm the losing manager and I'm praising the referee, I must be going soft,' said Reid. </p> <p>But the game needed a goal and it was a defender who showed the strikers how to finish.

Cudicini had come into the Chelsea goal at the last minute after the first choice, Ed de Goey, had strained a muscle during the kick-in.

There has been Dominic Cork's match at Lord's; a couple of purple spells from Andrew Caddick; Darren Gough, now canny as well as impish, alarming overseas left-handers with the new ball; Stewart's hundred in his 100th Test and Marcus Trescothick's encouraging arrival in international cricket. </p> <p>So it's not so strange that one of the more significant advances by any English cricketer this summer has passed almost unnoticed. Perhaps it is appropriate that Craig White should now find himself a regular in the England squad without any fanfare. For White does not crave the spotlight; and he concedes that he's not the most confident man in the world, that he has a tendency for introspection, for agonising over past failures on the cricket field. </p> <p>In a way this is remarkable. You'd think anyone born in Yorkshire and brought up in Victoria, Australia, would, at best, be full of himself; at worst intolerably brash and insensitive; a talker not a listener. So much for our stereotypes. White is quietly spoken, unassuming and a little diffident; far closer to Graham Thorpe, say, than his fellow Yorkshireman, Gough. </p> <p>He's had an astonishing eight months. Last winter he was in New Zealand, in the middle of an undertaking to play one-day cricket for Central Districts when the SOS from South Africa arrived. This surprised him since he was not one of the reserves alerted to be on standby for the tour. He replaced the injured Andrew Flintoff and his one-day performances soon impressed coach, Duncan Fletcher, something White learnt at first hand on another rain-soaked afternoon in South Africa. </p> <p>'I remember being in my room and I got a call from Duncan to come and see him. He told me he'd seen something he liked not just for one-day cricket but for Test cricket as well. Somehow he knows how to say the right thing at the right time. He lets you know that he rates you. And I came out of his room ten feet tall, feeling a world-beater.' </p> <p>The central contract, offered White at the start of this season, soon confirmed that Fletcher wasn't blathering; he put the ECB's money where his mouth was. The pundits were surprised but now most of us nod sagely. Yet it has not been straightforward for White this summer. </p> <p>He was omitted from the team to play against Zimbabwe at Lord's in May and tore a hamstring while on a training run. The hamstring tear was to become the least of his worries as he recalls: 'I went back to Yorkshire and on the Sunday I was going to Headingley on my motorbike for some treatment and I could hardly see. On the Monday my vision failed again. On the Tuesday when I was in Scarborough I had a pain in my chest and blacked out. I ended up in the gutter with blood pouring from my chin. Apparently I'd been unconscious for about 20 seconds'. </p> <p>After a night in hospital under observation there was a desperately anxious ten days for White awaiting the results of a variety of tests. No definite answers were produced but at least blood clots or brain tumours were ruled out. During that period White contemplated life without cricket and certainly began to view things in a different light: cricket was suddenly a game again. </p> <p>It may be fanciful to suggest that White's improved performances in an England shirt are a direct consequence of this frightening experience, but there is no doubt that he's looked far more relaxed in international cricket this summer, especially when he's tossing down 88 mph reverse swingers from around the wicket to the West Indian left-handers. </p> <p>However there was good reason for him to feel a bit awkward in his first spell as an England player. Back in 1994 he was mischievously plucked out of the hat by that Yorkshire magician, Raymond Illingworth, and suddenly plunged into the England side at number six. 'I could sense the conflict between Athers and Illy over selection and that played on my mind. I was thrilled to play and I wouldn't change that but I think I would have played more for England if I'd started a couple of years later,' he says. </p> <p>For White the pace bowler was incredibly raw in 1994. He came over to England from the Australian Academy in 1990. 'I arrived as an opening batsman, who also bowled off-spin and was a reserve wicketkeeper,' he recalls. Like Fred Trueman he played for the Yorkshire first team before playing in the second XI and actually took five wickets in an innings against Surrey at Harrogate in that season bowling off-spinners. </p> <p>But he cemented his place in the team as a batsman. In the nets he bowled some seamers and Martyn Moxon was impressed by his surprising pace from such a gentle, ambling approach and started giving him a few overs in this vein in Championship cricket in 1993. In 1994 he was in the Test team; it was, as they say in Bendigo, where White was raised, 'a big ask'. </p> <p>Now at the age of 30 he's learnt his trade. He offers the batsman an unusual threat especially with the old ball. He has become a reverse-swing specialist. When the ball stops swinging in the orthodox manner for Gough and Caddick it's time to toss the ball to White to see if reverse swing can come into play. He attacks the left-handers, predominantly from around the wicket and the slip cordon are on the alert. He's content in a role that has changed significantly since his arrival in England a decade ago. Now he's a bowler, who bats as low as number eight for England. He's yet to score many runs at Test level but he should do. On a broader scale he's happy - after his experience in Scarborough - just to be playing.</p>",

In years gone by the Pakistanis have been the masters of reverse swing but in Gough and White we have two of the best in the business and they will see a lot of work in the three Tests. </p> <p>Andy Caddick's effectiveness might be dulled as the bounce tends to be of the skiddy variety so his height won't help him that much. </p> <p>I doubt that there will be too many surprises when the party is announced as England now look to be a settled outfit.

Andy Caddick's effectiveness might be dulled as the bounce tends to be of the skiddy variety so his height won't help him that much. I doubt that there will be too many surprises when the party is announced as England now look to be a settled outfit. But they pick must players who can deal with Saqlain.",

      "body": "<p>The NatWest final is often regarded as cricket's FA Cup. The ECB's chief executive, Tim Lamb, made that comparison again yesterday while Lord's was enveloped by rain, which means that the game takes place today. The parallel may be valid, but it is not such a cheery thought as it once was. In recent times the FA Cup has become devalued; it is no longer regarded as the pinnacle of the football season and judging by the ticket sales for the game between Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, cricket's one-day final is also losing its appeal. </p> <p>17,000 tickets had been sold for the match, so even if the sun had shone there would have been some embarrassing empty spaces in a stadium that now holds 28,000. There was a time when a final ticket was a rare and valuable item. When Warwickshire played their semi-final against Hampshire at Edgbaston the ground was barely a third full. The ECB must surely reconsider their pricing policy. Better to fill the ground rather than charge up to \u00a350 for a ticket. </p> <p>There was also a time when victory in the one-day final constituted a fine season for a county side. There is no guarantee of that now. Warwickshire, even if they win the final today, have a few problems to sort out. The advent of two divisions has changed the emphasis of the season. Narrowly - and controversially - consigned to the second division in both competitions last year, Warwickshire are not guaranteed to escape in either form of the game. They are seventh in the Championship table and third in the one-day league. </p> <p>So even if they win this final they can't put their feet up for the rest of the season. Their coach, Bob Woolmer, has openly mused whether their current captain, Neil Smith, should demand a regular place in the team; one or two of their prominent players want away and Allan Donald won't be returning next summer. </p> <p>Not that anything can be taken for granted against Gloucestershire, who contest their fourth consecutive Lord's final; they have won their previous three. In Worcester they grumpily aver that their name must already be written on the trophy; remember how Worcestershire defeated Gloucestershire in the first round of the NatWest this summer but were forced to replay the game because they fielded an ineligible player. </p> <p>Gloucestershire make their own luck as well. They have a superbly complimentary duo in charge; the softly-spoken, self-effacing Mark Alleyne and the Kiwi, John Bracewell, forthright and innovative. Together they have forged a magnificent one-day side, which bats and fields aggressively and whose bowlers make a virtue of their lack of pace. The names on the Gloucestershire scorecard terrify no one but the team is formidable, which is a reflection on the achievements of Alleyne and Bracewell. </p> <p>Another leadership duo to be much lauded in recent days is England's Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain. Hussain was there yesterday as part of Channel 4's commentary team and as the rain persisted he was prevailed upon to look forward to the final Test at The Oval. He was, as usual, cooperative, but wary since he could not reveal the decisions of the selectors about the team for the final Test, which will be announced today or the composition of the touring parties (announced tomorrow). </p> <p>In a way Fletcher and Hussain are seeking to ape the achievements of Alleyne and Bracewell, to create an England team that is as tight-knit and committed to one another as the best of county sides. Hussain reinforced the notion that his players are starting to believe they are England cricketers, first and foremost. Their county allegiances are becoming increasingly peripheral and their appearances strictly controlled by Fletcher. </p> <p>He is peculiarly suited to this role. It actually helps that Fletcher is from overseas. This means that he has no axes to grind. Admittedly he had two years as a coach at Glamorgan but he can be dispassionate in his judgment of who can play when, without the pull of old mates from his old county. </p> <p>Hussain said that England would not be looking to protect their 2-1 lead in the series by playing for a draw at The Oval. Five days is a long time for both of these teams, he said. But he also pined for a longer match. It will be good for the game if the Test goes five days like Old Trafford. It would also be good for the ECB coffers that cannot afford many more truncated Tests or damp, sparsely- attended one-day finals.</p>",

They are seventh in the Championship table and third in the one-day league. So even if they win this final they can't put their feet up for the rest of the season. Their coach, Bob Woolmer, has openly mused whether their current captain, Neil Smith, should demand a regular place in the team; one or two of their prominent players want away and Allan Donald won't be returning next summer. Not that anything can be taken for granted against Gloucestershire, who contest their fourth consecutive Lord's final; they have won their previous three. In Worcester they grumpily aver that their name must already be written on the trophy; remember how Worcestershire defeated Gloucestershire in the first round of the NatWest this summer but were forced to replay the game because they fielded an ineligible player. Gloucestershire make their own luck as well. They have a superbly complimentary duo in charge; the softly-spoken, self-effacing Mark Alleyne and the Kiwi, John Bracewell, forthright and innovative. Together they have forged a magnificent one-day side, which bats and fields aggressively and whose bowlers make a virtue of their lack of pace. The names on the Gloucestershire scorecard terrify no one but the team is formidable, which is a reflection on the achievements of Alleyne and Bracewell. Another leadership duo to be much lauded in recent days is England's Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain. Hussain was there yesterday as part of Channel 4's commentary team and as the rain persisted he was prevailed upon to look forward to the final Test at The Oval. He was, as usual, cooperative, but wary since he could not reveal the decisions of the selectors about the team for the final Test, which will be announced today or the composition of the touring parties (announced tomorrow). In a way Fletcher and Hussain are seeking to ape the achievements of Alleyne and Bracewell, to create an England team that is as tight-knit and committed to one another as the best of county sides. Hussain reinforced the notion that his players are starting to believe they are England cricketers, first and foremost. Their county allegiances are becoming increasingly peripheral and their appearances strictly controlled by Fletcher. He is peculiarly suited to this role. It actually helps that Fletcher is from overseas. This means that he has no axes to grind. Admittedly he had two years as a coach at Glamorgan but he can be dispassionate in his judgment of who can play when, without the pull of old mates from his old county. Hussain said that England would not be looking to protect their 2-1 lead in the series by playing for a draw at The Oval. Five days is a long time for both of these teams, he said. But he also pined for a longer match. It will be good for the game if the Test goes five days like Old Trafford. It would also be good for the ECB coffers that cannot afford many more truncated Tests or damp, sparsely- attended one-day finals.",

That's tomorrow our time.</p> <p>The name Podmore might not be as famous as Bradman down under but we've both been pros long enough to have gained the reputation as respected observers of the game. Our cricketing skills were honed at an early age, yours by hitting a golf ball against a water tank with a stump. Not being born with a silver spoon the young Pod had never heard of golf, and had to make do with lumps of ballast on the Nottingham-Sheffield railway line - four if you got it halfway up the embankment, six and out if you hit a train.</p> <p>The similarities don't end there.

      "bodyText": "Dear Sir 'The Don' Bradman, Pod's had a bit of time on his hands this weekend (Gloucestershire hired me as a consultant to spot any loopholes, in case they didn't win the NatWest Final), so I thought I'd sit down and send you best wishes on your 90-oddth birthday which they tell me was yesterday. That's tomorrow our time. The name Podmore might not be as famous as Bradman down under but we've both been pros long enough to have gained the reputation as respected observers of the game. Our cricketing skills were honed at an early age, yours by hitting a golf ball against a water tank with a stump. Not being born with a silver spoon the young Pod had never heard of golf, and had to make do with lumps of ballast on the Nottingham-Sheffield railway line - four if you got it halfway up the embankment, six and out if you hit a train. The similarities don't end there. Take our international careers. Everybody knows that you fell just four runs short of having a Test average of 100. And by weird coincidence that's exactly my Test average - four, a boundary scored off a thick edge in my solitary England appearance against Sri Lanka. There's been some carping over the years that I got those runs only because the slip cordon was distracted by a stand being burnt down by Tamils.

If it ever comes Australia's way on BBC Choice, I'd choose not to watch that particular episode, mate. I won't go into the gory details but it was then that the powers-that-be decided to introduce routine drug tests after every recording.

      "body": "<p>If you ever doubted the merits of European integration go and get a visa for your non-EC national spouse at any EC embassy. You'll find it a small piece of bureaucratic holiday pre-history perfectly preserved. If you're under 40 you won't even remember that it used to be like this to go on holiday anywhere - the long queues, the raffle tickets, the security man who treats you like a criminal for wanting to visit his country, the assumption that somehow you must be undesirable if you have to subject yourself to this process. </p> <p>The offices are always in a dark windowless basement. There is always security glass (as if there was any point in stealing a visa) and there is always an officious official, generally female, walking around with a clipboard. They want your bank statements, your marriage certificates, a letter from your employer and a solemn promise that you won't like their country enough to actually stay there. All the time you want to scream: 'We're only going on holiday.' But you can't because the man has a rubber stamp marked 'denied' and being grumpy might be a reason for using it. </p> <p>For me and my wife though, the Italian consulate will always stand out as the only place where our actual choice of destination was questioned. 'Ischia? Why on earth do you want to go there?' said the man behind the counter, whose blue shirt and crumpled monotone tie were the height of bureaucrat chic. We couldn't work out why he would say it, though after two hours at the consulate it was a question we were starting to ask ourselves. If good things come to those who wait, Ischia would have to be paradise. </p> <p>The island of Ischia sits in the middle of the bay of Naples, a 30-minute boat ride from the city, its holiday appeal apparently rendered invisible by the wealth and fame of nearby Capri and the overcrowded resort draw of Sorrento. The island has been treated as Capri's supposedly ugly sister for two millennia, in 29BC the Roman emperor Augustus swapped Ischia with the Greeks to get hold of Capri. The island has had an inferiority complex ever since, even to the extent of fostering a legend about an island next door where the women are incredibly beautiful. The women of Ischia are expected, presumably, to take this on their double chins. </p> <p> It takes as long to duck and dive through the smog and snarl-up of Naples to get to the boat for Ischia as does the journey from the port to Ischia itself. The journey is short enough that your companions are more likely to be commuters than tourists. But the island might as well be on another planet. When you arrive at Ischia Port, a volcanic lagoon fringed with green hills and a fishing-village picture-postcard sea-front, Naples feels 100 years away. They say you can see Naples from Ischia on a clear day. But who would bother looking? </p> <p>They, which I suppose means people who produce brochures, call Ischia the Green Island, historically because of the mineral content of the rocks, now because of the foliage that seems to cling to the volcanic summit and foothills that dominate the island. </p> <p>Ischia is small, only 47 square kilometres, and nearly half the 40,000 inhabitants live in the main town, simply called Ischia. Because of its size there are limits on the number of cars allowed on the island and restrictions on building which have stopped it turning into any kind of resort hell. Everything here feels up close and personal in the nicest sense (except perhaps the cliff edges on some of the winding roads). The two best hotels, Il Moresco and the Excelsior, are barely visible from behind trees and bushes - the lemon tree and Indian fig are trademarks of the island. There are cacti, exotic birds, fruits, trees hanging out of everyone's back garden, views from extinct volcanoes, seafood by the bucket, beaches, castles, history. So how has such a beautiful place remained relatively undiscovered? </p> <p>There have been people on Ischia since the Stone Age. It's been occupied by the Phoenicians, taken over by the Syracusans, claimed by Romans, overrun by wealthy refugees from Pompeii, attacked by the Vandals, Byzantines, Saracens and Normans, developed by the Emperor of Swabia (don't ask me where that was), routinely swapped between France and Spain, returned to Garibaldi's new Italy and occupied by the Germans between 1942 and 1945. The invading Tourists must have seemed harmless in comparison. </p> <p>Of course the real reason for its absence from most tourist radars is that the island is very small and those who got here first (the Germans again) have kept coming back. There wasn't room for many more until recently and so there was no need for Ischians to shout about the place. </p> <p>There are other reasons why it has escaped attention. It caters for the quieter crowd, which has tended to mean older and richer folk and tourists who don't like tourists. The word of mouth has probably been limited because the kind of people who like Ischia wouldn't want to tell everyone about it. Its appeal is genteel, lying less in the beaches, which are plentiful but of mixed quality, and more in the volcanic springs and heated mineral waters which hide beneath Ischia's volcanic rocks. All the best hotels have spas and for those of us who think heaven will be an eternally hot bath with a succession of books and newspapers and a constantly replenished glass of fine wine, Ischia can give you a strong hint of how pleasant eternity could be. Mobile phones only work sporadically here too. </p> <p>The island even produces its own wine, which is exclusively drunk there. The Pietratorcia (Flaming Rock) winery on the island is open to visitors and offers light lunch and a tour of the vineyard for a pittance. Don't let the kids ask what they're going to do with the luvvly bunny wabbits they keep in a stony underground hutch, though. They double as the local culinary speciality. </p> <p> You don't need to choose between the beach or the hot bath. The nearest Ischia comes to a resort is at the Poseidon Gardens, where the prettiest beach backs on to an outdoor spa and bath complex with differently styled pools supplied by the 12 local springs and varying in temperature from 26C to 40C (for those who aren't cooks or chemists, the temperature of a very hot bath). From the coastal road above it looks like a giant crazy-golf course. Poseidon gets quite crowded so we went to the Negombo, which is more to local tastes, smaller and one suspects the island's premier water-based al fresco shagging opportunity. </p> <p>All of Ischia reeks of understated unhurried good-living. In fact the only bold and dramatic thing about Ischia is its castle, which, if you saw The Talented Mr Ripley, you have already seen without knowing it. The fake coastal town of Mongibello in the film was a composite of a number of southern Italian towns, but the beach where Ripley and his prey meet and the town square with a huge island castle in the background is Ischia. The cast stayed at Il Moresco and loved it, though how Gwyneth Paltrow maintained her stick-like dignity with the overgenerous portions and five courses they serve up at lunch and dinner is a mystery to me. </p> <p>If you don't want to return home with unwelcome excess baggage on your gut then the castle does at the very least offer an opportunity for a brisk uphill walk. There is a lift (not an original feature), but the walk up the wide spiral passage that leads to the top is cool and invigorating with a couple of shrines and chapels for those who want to mask their exhaustion with fake religious fervour. </p> <p>The castle's history is typically rich. It was used as a refuge from pirates by local inhabitants and at one time was home to 5,000 people. Michelangelo is said to have designed a turret for Princess Vittoria Colonna. They claim Mona Lisa came from here. It boasted 13 churches and was a convent for the Poor Sisters of Clare. The word Poor hardly does justice to the miserable existence of the Sisters of Clare. The convent was made up of the unloved first-born daughters of wealthy folk and when they died, their bodies were not buried but sat in chairs to putrefy in the room where the nuns prayed. The remains were left to drain away through a hole in the chair into the rocks. Mortality rates were high, which I suppose, was the point. The chairs are still there. </p> <p>The only English intervention up to now in the history of the island was noisy and unhelpful - the Royal Navy bombarded the castle and destroyed part of it in 1809. Well, not quite the only intervention. The English composer Sir William Walton made a lasting, positive contribution to the island and remains the Ischians basic idea of what the English are like. Walton fell in love with the island and made his home here in 1949, creating a now beautiful garden from a lump of volcanic rock that the locals thought utterly barren. The venture was written off as a typically eccentric and hopeless piece of English bravado. Walton is no more, but his Argentinian wife Susana prowls the garden at La Mortella, now open to the public and containing at least 300 exotic plants from all sorts of places whose climate is nothing like Ischia, evangelising its beauty and the talents of its designer Russell Page. Go there in the morning or the late evening to avoid the busy times or go when Lady Walton has scheduled a recital. But definitely go. </p> <p>Perhaps as a thank you to Walton, Ischians are prepared to forget the bombardment and welcome the English back. The mainly middle-aged Germans are not coming in the numbers they were so there are vacancies which British travel agents are moving in on. The nightlife of Ischia is not sensational, your kids would get bored in less than 24 hours, but if you and your significant other want some peace and quiet and a do-nothing, feelgood fortnight away from home and work, the food, the hot spas, the beach and the sheer green tranquility of the place will send you to bed early anyway. And as for the man at the Italian embassy. Well, I'm afraid, my friend, the secret of Ischia is out. </p> <p>\u0095 From 6-31 October, Crystal Premier Italy offers seven nights at the four-star Il Moresco from \u00a3818 per person, including Gatwick-Naples flights and transfers (0870 888 0024). </p> <p>\u0095 Lady Walton's garden at La Mortella is open from 1 April to 15 November on Tue, Thu, Sat and Sun, 9am-7pm. Concerts at 5pm in recital hall at weekends. Five-day breaks staying in a newly built annex to the house are available from \u00a3795 per person from Heritage Productions (020 8878 5887).</p>",

Billy Dodds scored a penalty for Rangers after 55 minutes before Sutton grabbed Celtic's sixth at the end to help his side leapfrog Rangers into second place in the table. Hibernian, who beat St Mirren 2-0 on Saturday, are a point clear at the top.",

      "body": "<p> Like any small Spanish beach town worth its salt, Sitges boasts the usual attractions; yellow sun, yellow sand, blue sea, blue sky and a pink church. Hey, wait a minute, a pink church? Is this a hint that there's more to the place than sun loungers and the ubiquitous grilled sardines? Indeed it is, because Sitges has a past - and a present - that is just a little bit unexpected. </p> <p>The flamingo-coloured Sant Bartmeu I Santa Tecla is, by coincidence not intent, rather symbolic of the town that prides itself on being the most gay-friendly in Catalonia - a sort of Spanish Brighton, only with sand and nice weather. In fact, Sitges welcomes all types of people - jet-setters, honeymooners, the retired, families with children and young people looking for fun. We sought it out as a brief respite from the hum and buzz of Barcelona, just half an hour's train journey around the Costa Dorada. </p> <p>But the gay community has really taken Sitges to its heart and who can blame them. Picture-perfect by day, with shady cervecer\u00edas for that vital pick-me-up after a few gruelling hours on the beach, by night it can be a vibrant hot-spot. </p> <p>Carrer del 1er de Maig, just off the seafront, is nicknamed Carrer de Pecado (Sin Street to you and me) because of its 10 or so bars which keep the place jumping into the early hours of the morning. Fun-seekers of all ages and proclivities drink, bop and generally 'large it' to a wide range of music (only some of it deeply dubious 'Europop') which swirls into a cacophony on the street outside. In February, there is carnaval , where revellers parade though the narrow streets, led by drag queens and party animals in outlandish costume, who come from all over Europe. </p> <p>If you want a peaceful evening though, the beachfront twinkles with the lights of small seafood restaurants and tapas bars, from where you can hear the cheery chinking of glasses of cava - and the waves lapping. </p> <p>So how, we wondered, did this wee town end up with such a split personality? It turns out that Sitges has spent more than a century welcoming groups that mainstream Spain hasn't been exactly fond of. </p> <p>In the 1890s the artist Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol settled here and invited the avant-garde art world to hang out and paint. Sitges responded to this bohemian invasion with laissez-faire aplomb and soon grew fond of its slightly eccentric children. Rusi\u00f1ol's studio-cum-house, now the Museu Cau Ferrat, is well worth a visit. There is something unsettling about blinking out of 1,000-watt sunshine into a small house two minutes from the beach, and trying to adjust to the gloom, only to realise that you are staring at Picasso drawings and El Greco paintings, as well Rusi\u00f1ol's own work. </p> <p>This artistic legacy is reflected in the shops that line the twisting, narrow streets of the town's centre. There are quirky little boutiques, craft shops and, of course, galleries exhibiting the works of the latest generation of artists to settle here. Some of these shops have a kind of happy, hippy- dippy feel with hand-dyed fabrics and psychedelic prints that hark back also to Sitges's second renaissance in the Sixties. </p> <p>Then, people came here to swing, man, away from the gaze of the, like, uptight Spanish authorities. It was a place where anything went, where inhibitions could be left at home, and the free-love society flocked here to chill out in the heat. There are still two nude beaches (one now exclusively gay), about 20 minutes walk from the far end of the main beach. </p> <p>We're not old enough to remember swinging (well, that's our story) so we stuck to the quiet, crescent-shaped, most emphatically non-nude Platja de Sant Sebastia.

The area was enclosed by ornate wrought iron - easy on the eye but discreetly protective. </p> <p>Ah, we thought, as we sipped our ice-cold Estrella beers, that's the real symbol of Sitges.</p> <p><strong>Fact file</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyjet.com\">EasyJet</a> flies from Luton to Barcelona, with fares from \u00a337.50 one-way.

'Demanding,' he said. </p> <p>Reaching the campsite was an adventure in itself; from Uganda's capital Kampala we took an hour-long flight in a twin-prop plane followed by four hours on dirt-track roads in a jeep, by which time the sun had set.

With Walt Disney, as it happened. </p> <p>You might be surprised to learn that Disney takes sourcing for its animated features very seriously. And so when Disney made its version of Tarzan , an orgy of apes and swinging lianas, it was felt that the director needed to experience real apes in real jungles. The obvious place to do the research was Uganda, a country which specialises in seeing families of wild gorillas at close quarters. And so after the release of the pic and (crucially) before the home video comes out, the director of Tarzan returned to the jungle, accompanied by a motley bunch of film critics, arts journalists and, weirdly, someone from a woman's puzzle magazine intending to write a honeymoon story. With gorillas and Disney somehow appearing in the midst. Or should I say in the mist? </p> <p>After a scary night on the campbed (the camp staff kindly allowed me to keep my hurricane lamp lit outside all night), I woke to see mist hanging in filmy clouds across the huge, verdant mountains. Bwindi's jungle isn't called Impenetrable for nothing; the thick, green mountain sides have never been touched. The whole area was saved from deforestation and declared a National Park when sleeping sickness deemed the land inappropriate for farming. </p> <p> Gorilla tracking is marketed as a 'unique' African experience, yet its invention was born of necessity. When Idi Amin took power in Uganda in 1971, the chaotic years that followed meant that much of Uganda's wildlife in the game reserves was slaughtered. The tourist authority had to find alternative attractions such as bird watching and gorilla tracking. Coincidentally, the renowned zoologist Dian Fossey had begun to 'naturalise' families of gorillas in neighbouring Rwanda. </p> <p>Using Fossey's techniques, families of Ugandan gorillas in two parks were naturalised in the same way. Still wild, and still very much in the wild, the great apes began to tolerate awe-inspired visitors on a daily basis. By 1998, Uganda was attracting 250,000 visitors every year, with gorilla tracking one of the main attractions. With tourists paying about $175 each for a one-day permit, it was a gold mine. </p> <p>Then on 1 March 1999, more than 100 Rwandan Hutu rebels swooped on Bwindi and hacked eight tourists and a Ugandan game warden to death. Immediately, business collapsed. Foreign tourism, which had accounted for 25 per cent of Uganda's total trade, fell to 10 per cent. </p> <p>A year on, things at Bwindi are improving. The company which had suffered the attack has gone out of business. But Volcanoes, where we were staying, was full and permits were at their maximum again while we were there (only 18 permits are issued a day). The camps have 24-hour armed guard and the situation in Central Africa has eased somewhat. And I felt reasonably confident that not only Disney but Hello! had ventured back. I mean, losing Rachel Hunter? Unthinkable. </p> <p>However, so intense is the experience of being in the middle of the Ugandan jungle that frankly all thoughts of guerillas were subsumed by thoughts of the big hairy version. The permit only allows one chance to track the gorillas; if you can't find them, it's tough luck. This isn't Windsor Safari Park. 'But you have a 90 per cent chance of seeing gorillas,' said Gadi, our guide. We were escorted by three rangers and two rifle-toting members of the Uganda People's Defence Force. Early in the morning Gadi had sent two fellow trackers off; communicating with walkie talkies they used tell-tale gorilla signs such as crushed vegetation, dung and, frankly, I don't know what to find the apes. </p> <p>Gorillas move quickly around the jungle, but our trackers had no compasses, no maps, and no paths. And we had to follow them. First we had to get into the jungle, which meant climbing about 2,000 feet for two hours up a vertical path in the boiling heat. </p> <p>Fine for the trackers. Fine for the Disney director, a rangy individual who clearly used the corporate gym on a maniacally regular basis. Not so fine for the British journalists. We suffered, oh how did we suffer. We carried three litres of water per person, and even that didn't seem like enough. Still, if Rachel could do it, I was going to. </p> <p>After that agony, we turned off the mountain ridge and crashed into the jungle. Suddenly, our gloves and sweltering long-sleeved shirts were a godsend as we pushed past thorny branches, climbed over logs, grabbed lianas and forded rivers. Occasionally, Gadi would talk to his men on the walkie-talkie, although how he kept track of our whereabouts relative to theirs, I will never know. The jungle canopy was hundreds of feet high, and solid. At times it was difficult even to see where the sun was. </p> <p>Did everyone make it? Yes. But we heard horror stories of exhausted people turning back in tears. After about the fifth hour and the tenth water stop, Gadi signalled for silence. 'The gorillas are near,' he said. We walked on. Suddenly, there they were. A huge silverback and his family. Five or six females, lying on the ground, scratching and hugging their babies, dear little furry toddlers who were messing about with sticks. The silverback watched us carefully; the others just carried on picking each other's fur, farting and grunting softly. A gorilla family chilling out after lunch. The babies swung from trees; the adults lay on the soft ground and watched them. We stood in riveted amazement. No one was allowed to use flash photography; you aren't even allowed to sneeze in the direction of the apes for fear of infection. </p> <p>After our allotted hour, we returned back down the mountain. Our legs and feet ached; our shirts were drenched and filthy. But we had had perhaps the closest encounter one could ever have with a truly wild animal - and the one closest in body and spirit to ourselves at that.</p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p><strong>Flights:</strong> British Airways (0845 77 333 77) has two non-stop flights from Gatwick to Entebbe a week and a third via Nairobi.

      "bodyText": "Strange how quickly things can change. Two years ago Glenn Hoddle, in his previous life as England coach, voiced puzzling doubts about Michael Owen's international credentials. Now Hoddle, with miraculous timing, nominates Owen as England's \"man of destiny a worthy and productive successor capable of wearing the boots of the departed king\". That's Alan Shearer, the great untouchable, by the way. Last May G\u00e9rard Houllier was congratulating himself on transforming Liverpool's defence into the Premiership's meanest. But on Saturday he was \"very angry\", even though he gave an object lesson in managerial restraint after the disarray that invited Southampton's thrilling comeback in the last 17 minutes. And no, he could not recall ever before squandering a three-goal lead. Because Hoddle's praise of Owen in a Sunday newspaper interview was presumably penned before Saturday, Southampton's manager must have felt a bittersweet satisfaction when the Liverpool striker supported his words with such potency here, albeit against Saints. \"At 3-0 down I felt the only difference was Michael Owen,\" Hoddle said. But then things, most notably Liverpool's defence, unravelled in a most peculiar way. Houllier's rearguard, a contender for tallest in the Premiership, exposed glaring aerial deficiencies and conceded three goals. Such was the misunderstanding among Liverpool's multinational back four that it could have been more.

Here I am, embarked on an ill-considered project of selling the flat I've inhabited and worked in for 15 years, leaving London where I've always lived, and buying a house in the provinces - all, my dears, in wild pursuit of my heart's desire. In the first place, I don't do wild; and in the second, I don't have a heart. These, I would have said, were givens.

      "body": "<p>Sir Richard Branson may be on the brink of controlling the National Lottery, as well as running his own airline and a massive business empire, but he can't control the weather. The Virgin boss was a high-profile victim of Hurricane Debby, the first big tropical storm to hit the Caribbean this year. </p> <p>While the future of the Lottery was being decided Branson was stranded on his private island of Necker. Presumably he had no trouble getting himself on the first available flight home, but what happens to the ordinary holidaymakers who get caught up in extreme weather conditions? </p> <p>Most tour operators have a hurricane contingency plan which clearly sets out their policy in the event of a tropical storm. Package holidaymakers whose travel plans are disrupted will be offered an alternative holiday or, if this is not possible, a flight home and possibly a refund. </p> <p>Only a handful of clients on the island of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands were affected by last week's storm. Caribtours relocated one couple staying at Biras Creek to a nearby island. </p> <p>British Airways Holidays announced its Hurricane Protection policy at the start of the summer season. In the event of a hurricane, holidaymakers are offered the option of returning to the UK or transferring to another holiday of equal value at no extra charge. All customers will also be offered 10 per cent off their holiday cost in vouchers to be used against future travel with British Airways Holidays. </p> <p>Independent travellers do not get the same protection and could find themselves footing the bill if extra nights' hotel accommodation are required due to delayed flights. Many travel insurance policies will not cover delays or expenses incurred by a hurricane as it is classified as an act of God. </p> <p>The hurricane season is officially from June to the end of October, but the most likely time for a hurricane to hit is late August or September.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson may be on the brink of controlling the National Lottery, as well as running his own airline and a massive business empire, but he can't control the weather. The Virgin boss was a high-profile victim of Hurricane Debby, the first big tropical storm to hit the Caribbean this year. While the future of the Lottery was being decided Branson was stranded on his private island of Necker. Presumably he had no trouble getting himself on the first available flight home, but what happens to the ordinary holidaymakers who get caught up in extreme weather conditions? Most tour operators have a hurricane contingency plan which clearly sets out their policy in the event of a tropical storm. Package holidaymakers whose travel plans are disrupted will be offered an alternative holiday or, if this is not possible, a flight home and possibly a refund. Only a handful of clients on the island of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands were affected by last week's storm. Caribtours relocated one couple staying at Biras Creek to a nearby island. British Airways Holidays announced its Hurricane Protection policy at the start of the summer season. In the event of a hurricane, holidaymakers are offered the option of returning to the UK or transferring to another holiday of equal value at no extra charge. All customers will also be offered 10 per cent off their holiday cost in vouchers to be used against future travel with British Airways Holidays. Independent travellers do not get the same protection and could find themselves footing the bill if extra nights' hotel accommodation are required due to delayed flights. Many travel insurance policies will not cover delays or expenses incurred by a hurricane as it is classified as an act of God. The hurricane season is officially from June to the end of October, but the most likely time for a hurricane to hit is late August or September. Brochure prices tend to reflect this fact with some of the cheapest deals being available in these months. Islands that have borne the brunt of tropical storms in recent years are Antigua, the Virgin Islands and the Leeward Islands such as St Kitts and Nevis. Historically, Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica and Cayman Islands have remained relatively unscathed. Caribtours managing director Catherine Leech said: 'Most people are pretty clued up as to when the hurricane season is. But it's difficult to warn people specifically about hurricanes when they are booking, as there is no real pattern to the season. Last year Hurricane Lenny took everyone by surprise in November.'",

On Tuesday, with a side bought for Gianluca Vialli's loose change, they had beaten Chelsea 2-0, not by last season's match-long desperation but by solid composure. On Saturday they were themselves outplayed, suffering not from Chelsea's famed complacency but from lethargy. \"We had heavy legs,\" said their manager Chris Hutchings. Before kick-off Rodney Marsh paid his dues for last season, when he promised to undergo public head-shaving if Bradford stayed up. In his playing days they would have needed shears and a wheelbarrow. On Saturday, after the centre-circle ceremony, it was Bradford whose strength had gone. In the closing minutes they owed their survival to Matt Clarke, whose reflexive save denied Ade Akinbiyi his first Premiership goal.

'The politics which it prompts most readily... is irritable, reactive, myopic: endlessly saturated with resentment.' A bilious tirade in the manner of the early Bernard Levin? Sometimes: and enjoyable in just that way. </p> <p>But Dunn strips away the cant to show us what lies behind. 'Capitalism has selected, refined and diffused quite widely a state form reconciled to human limitations (greed, quarrelsomeness, severely limited altruism) but still aimed at mitigating the vulnerability of its subjects and serving their more insistent and commonplace concerns.' This state form isn't 'inspiring or morally commanding'. 'We owe it no veneration... But we do owe it our loyalty and perhaps also some of our patience.' </p> <p>The Cunning of Unreason fizzes and stimulates precisely because it is Olympian in tone and judgment. Politics, its practitioners and servants, need to be pygmies on the plain: distance lends perspective as well as disenchantment. There is no 'progress' to high-toned goals. There is only muddling through.</p> <p>It's a valid and, at root, oddly positive thesis, the assertion of a clear-eyed reality. And yet I do have a problem. The contemporary meat in this sandwich of political science is Dunn's own take on the Thatcher years - her 'crusade against the tendency for every society's capacity for political agency to dissipate helplessly into endless factional squabbling and inanition... her Just War in which ultimate victory was in the end jeopardised by the pusillanimity of her colleagues and her (reluctantly chosen) successor'. </p> <p>When the gods of academe play pundit, they make themselves mortal. Dunn is at his frailest when he tries to fit his views about Thatcherism to the era of The Lady. Did she consciously set about 'lowering labour costs by shrinking employment'? Did she really - genuinely obsessive - set out to purge the Civil Service and the professions of education and medicine of their capacity to resist her will? Would she even have torn down the union movement if it had been cannier in its campaigning? </p> <p>None of this quite fits with the pensive, nervy Thatcher of Opposition painted so effectively in John Campbell's new biography, or with the real blankness of the 1979 manifesto. It's an unworthy thought, but you can't help wondering whether this particular Dunn vision owes more to affronted high-table chatter and the cuts that came alongside a university expansion which is (coldly considered) the biggest difference to our lives wrought in the last 15 years. More than that, he seems to think the tides of economic liberalism went out with Mrs T (which may be news to today's teachers or beleaguered doctors). </p> <p>But no harm done. Writing about politics is a human activity: and humanity's flaws are salt in the stew. Dunn attacks with a disarming lack of certainty not reflected in his surface rhetoric.

'On present evidence, there are no dependable sources of insight, and no methods which, clearly grasped and accurately applied, ensure even the haziest comprehension of what's going on politically.'

But from the moment she sits down, smiling and hugging her knees, she seems happy to discuss a variety of topics, including her career, emotions, insecurities, and the strange clunking noises emanating from the hotel chimney.

McKee's latest movie, There's Only One Jimmy Grimble, is about football, specifically a young boy's belief that a pair of magic boots is helping him to play as well as his Manchester City heroes.

However, McKee is probably best known for bringing natural grace and gravitas to serious dramatic roles, from Mary Cox, to the disabled friend in Notting Hill, to the alcoholic mother in Mothertime, to most recently the sexually abused daughter on stage in Five Kinds of Silence at the Lyric, Hammersmith. </p> <p>But what of McKee herself? From the scant biographical details available, it seems that she is indeed married with children, and grew up in Easington, a colliery town in County Durham. During our conversation, a fuller picture emerges of a creative child from an ordinary background, who loved to draw, write stories, and act out plays. McKee confirms that, as a child, she had 'the sort of imagination that people almost criticise you for. I've always had this kind of creative energy.' </p> <p>McKee explains that while she wasn't encouraged by those around her, she wasn't discouraged either. 'It was a case of \"well, if you want to try it, why not?\"' She did try it, from the age of 14, in the afternoon television show Quest of Eagles, and then with the National Youth Theatre. At 17, McKee was turned down for drama school. Her response was to simply carry on work ing. For years, she tortured herself, thinking that she had missed out on some 'big secret', which would stop her becoming a great actress. Strangely, though maybe tellingly, McKee never thought to tell the drama school interviewers of her youthful successes. </p> <p>'It didn't occur to me,' she says, puzzled herself. 'I don't know why. It just would never have occurred to me to sit down and say: ' These are my attributes, this is what I can do. It took me years and years to understand how people promote themselves, not just in this business, but in life. It's a valuable skill, but I was never taught it. It wasn't part of my upbringing.' The merest shadow crosses McKee's face, but then she catches herself, and smiles. 'But you know, I didn't do too badly.' </p> <p>Since her Bafta-winning performance in Our Friends in the North, McKee has worked with directors as diverse as Mike Figgis (The Loss Of Sexual Innocence), Michael Winterbottom (Wonderland), Luc Besson (Joan of Arc), and Mike Leigh (Naked). 'I learned from all of them,' she says. 'But Mike Leigh was brilliant - totally liberating, but scary.' </p> <p>McKee's next project is the film Morality Place. Obviously gaining ground on the international stage, she remains a favourite with the British public. Two of her co-stars in There's Only Only One Jimmy Grimble are Robert Carlyle and Ray Winstone, which seems fitting: all three actors share a quality that makes their fans follow their progress almost as if they were rock bands. Jaded friends of mine became unusually animated at the mention of McKee's name. One friend who had seen a performance of Five Kinds of Silence reported that McKee exuded an 'integrity' which made it virtually impossible to tear your eyes away from her, even when she wasn't speaking. </p> <p> Five Kinds of Silence was the first theatre work she'd done for seven years, McKee was pleasantly surprised to find herself enjoying the experience. 'There is this thing about having a gap, which makes people think it's going to be really nerve-racking,' she says. 'But, as it got closer to the opening night, I thought I just don't feel this fear that other people are feeling on my behalf. I clearly had anxieties , but I don't think they were any worse than they would have been if I'd been in the theatre for the last few years.' </p> <p>It emerges that these anxieties are less debilitating than they are a creative spur: 'I'm extremely self-critical. Although I try not to be ridiculous about it, wearing horsehair shirts and all that. It's a private exercise I don't necessarily share with other people. A lot of the time, I'm not looking for reassurance. I suppose I'm just looking for ways to stop myself being lazy, to make sure I'm giving myself enough space to explore and create.' </p> <p>When she is talking about her work, McKee could not be more animated. When I ask her if she is still in acting for the same reasons she joined, she cries: 'What a lovely, lovely question, that's really made my day... Yes I am, yes.' Earlier she'd told me that acting was a gamble, but that you could end up with 'the most fantastic life'. It is only when the conversation dances too close to McKee's personal life that her voice trails away, and she becomes a sphinx once more. Even as we're talking, I'm realising that I'm not exactly getting anything new from her, or anything she hasn't made a concrete decision to give away. However, maybe this is a characteristic of self-made people. Early self-motivation got Gina McKee where she is, self-possession keeps her there, and, in the politest possible way, she is not about to relinquish control.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There's something very familiar about Billy Elliot. On the surface it's the kind of British film we've come to expect. All the usual elements are in place: an urban working class background, disaffected youth, drab terraced housing and a close-knit community beset by conflict. It's the rite of passage, northern style. This tradition of kitchen sink realism is as British as wet bank holidays and equally predictable. </p> <p>But Billy Elliot, the debut from Stephen Daldry, a former director of London's Royal Court Theatre, is a film of big ambitions, a leap forward in terms of mood and scope. As cheering festival audiences at Cannes and last week Edinburgh can attest, there is something special and novel about Billy Elliot . But what is it? True, it owes a substantial debt to the documentary realism of Ken Loach. But this is realism not constrained by circumstance and location. Neither is it a feelgood fantasy like The Full Monty with an undeniable small screen pedigree. It is a celebratory, emotional film without cloying sentiment, which is no small achievement. </p> <p>More importantly, the film successfully mixes two elements, which at first might seem incongruous: gritty realism with joyous escapism. Think what might have happened if - however unlikely it sounds - Loach had directed West Side Story and you're on the right lines. </p> <p>Set in a north-east mining town during the 1984-85 strike, the story concerns an 11-year miner's son who discovers a wonderful yet inconvenient gift for ballet. Encouraged by his teacher, yet wary of telling his embattled, striking father and older brother, he learns surreptitiously. Although the action takes place a mere 15 years ago, this is a different kind of Britain, deep in the throes of the last great display of union strength. There is an air of siege mentality. In virtually every outdoor scene a policeman lurks in the corner of the frame, while barricades and riot shields are part of the landscape. </p> <p>Life is nasty, brutish and soon to be alarmingly different. But from the start Billy Elliot confounds expectations. The movie begins with a dream-like image of the young protagonist, played by newcomer Jamie Bell, apparently defying gravity, jumping through thin air. In fact, he is bouncing on his bed to the wistful sounds of Marc Bolan, but the tone is set. This is a film that intriguingly blurs reality with impressionism. </p> <p>The flights of fancy are taken further in the energetic dance scenes as Billy taps, pirouettes and slides on cobbled streets, rooftops, the bathroom - basically whenever the mood takes him. At times Billy Elliot feels like a musical. There are no elaborate, choreographed set pieces boasting a cast of hundreds but the film is reliant on movement and music to tell its story. As Billy's dancing improves so his awkwardness diminishes, but his dancing remains untamed, seemingly untutored and breathlessly evocative. As the camera swoops around the suspiciously empty streets in those scenes, the urban locale takes on a sort of grandeur. </p> <p>The film is propelled by Bell's finely balanced performance. He is an attractive but not winsome character whose bemusement, resentment and perseverance are evident. He has the soul of an artist but generally the tongue of a sullen and abrasive schoolboy. When Billy is given the opportunity to audition for ballet school his short temper proves calamitous. </p> <p> Kes, which sees a young boy's plight alleviated by a powerful hobby, quickly springs to mind. But although Loach's films contain humour, they are hardly humorous. Here, despite adversity, there is the comedy of manners, embarrassment and adolescent romance. </p> <p>The plot is admittedly conventional in its main theme, suggesting the only way out of this working class cul de sac is via a combination of natural talent and luck. Similarly, when the stricken community bonds together to pay for Billy's travel expenses to the climatic audition despite their own obvious hardship, the scene smacks of clich\u00e9. </p> <p>However, Billy Elliot is notable for its execution more than its familiar storyline. Stephen Daldry, working from Lee Hall's trenchant and witty script, displays a instinctive visual flair and cinematic understanding. 'Filmmaking is a matter of trying to find performances that you believe in and creating images that have emotional potency. Unlike most theatre, which is rooted in the re-creation of authentic experience, a lot of great movies are not about authentic experience at all, but rather they operate on a subconscious level - the language of dreams. That's the vernacular of film.' </p> <p>The 'language of dreams' has not been particularly significant in the canon of social realist films. The obvious artistry of Billy Elliot puts it at odds with many of its predecessors. The groundbreaking working class films of the Sixties such as Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, A Kind of Loving, Room at the Top were startling in their depiction of social inequities, but these were not films to savour for their cinematic verve. They were partially inspired by the similarly dour literary work of the Angry Young Men. </p> <p> The trend continued and its no surprise that influential modern British directors such as Loach, Mike Leigh and, especially, Alan Clarke looked at society from the same angle. In recent years Lynne Ramsey's Ratcatcher and Gary Oldman's Nil By Mouth have looked at urban dislocation and family neglect without flinching. </p> <p>These films were governed by a mission to document harsh experience. Personal and political themes are examined in the domestic environment. The desire to entertain might not be among the priorities, but that is exactly what Billy Elliot does. It is warm and palpably feelgood, yet thoughtful and provoking. It is hard not to be moved when Billy's dad, forced by circumstance, contemplates becoming a 'scab' worker. </p> <p> Of course Billy Elliot has been so well received partially due to the paucity of the competition. It seems, every week, another popgun gangster flick or flaccid ensemble relationship drama is unleashed, to a now suspecting public. Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels and TV's This Life have a lot to answer for. In fact, in addition to Ratcatcher and Nil By Mouth, it's often working class themed dramas such as A Room of Romeo Brass and Wonderland that have won plaudits. Like Billy Elliot though, the latter pair found optimism where others have tended to find little. </p> <p>This year has yet to see a British film that has delighted critics and set cash registers ringing. It suggests there is a captive audience for this year's Great British Film. Billy Elliot should put that straight . It has the right ingredients; charm, great cast, good soundtrack (who cares if the Bolan hits are from the wrong decade) and that all important X-factor. It gives the impression that audiences are seeing something new. For once, the billing doesn't lie. It's a breath of fresh air, which should challenge our notions of what our homegrown cinema can aspire to - both populist and persuasive. And the kitchen sink has never looked so gleaming. </p> <p>\u0095 Billy Elliot opens on 29 September</p>",

And it's all free. Our guide shows you how to get the most from your day. </p> <p><strong> Quick guide to Carnival</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> 1 Mas'</strong> Short for Masquerade, the costumed parades which form the backbone of Carnival. This year more than 50 mas' bands will pulsate and gyrate their way around the three-mile circular parade route, picking up followers along the way and hoping to impress the judges with their interpretation of a chosen theme: aliens, the Wild West and a celebration of black hair are just a few of the storylines to look out for this year. Music will be provided by live soca, calypso and steel bands. The parades take place between noon and 7pm on Sunday and Monday. The Sunday event is designated as a children's parade. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Static Sound Systems</strong> Originally frowned on by Carnival purists, the sound systems are now recognised as an important element of the Carnival experience and this year there are more than 50 systems to choose from each playing their own selection of soca, reggae, jazz, soul, hip-hop, house, garage and Latin. The best ones will attract big crowds. Just look for a huge stack of speakers and follow the noise. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Live stages </strong> BBC Radio 1 is hosting the biggest outdoor stage at Horniman's Pleasance with acts such as Wookie, Shola Ama and Jamelia appearing on Sunday and an all-day rap show broadcast live on Monday with a bill topped by De La Soul. In Powis Square the Resurrected Stage will feature live acts and DJs playing everything from samba to reggae and drum and bass. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Food stalls </strong> Hundreds of licensed street stalls will be selling delicious food including West Indian specialities such as jerk chicken, Jamaican patties and curries. </p> <p><strong> Five survival tips</strong></p> <p> <strong>1 </strong> Plan your travel carefully as some London Underground stations will be closed and bus routes diverted. Don't even think about driving to Notting Hill and allow extra time for train connections.

If you should become separated from your kids there are lost and found children centres at Lancaster Road and outside the bus depot in Great Western Road. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Two of the best vantage points to watch the parade are the Kensal Green end of Ladbroke Grove and near the judging point halfway along Westbourne Grove.

      "byline": "Nigel Slater",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a disease in the food world more rampant than any salmonella, BSE or swine fever. It has been slowly attacking our fruit, vegetables and even meat for some time and appears unstoppable. I call it creeping sweetness. </p> <p>One expects a certain sweet blandness to find its way into processed food. Sugar with everything is as much a part of general dumbing down as television makeovers. But it comes as more of a surprise when you find it has been bred into your tomatoes, peas, celery and carrots. </p> <p>It should surprise no one to find a hefty dose of saccharin in a corn cob. It ain't called sweetcorn for nothing. Yet not even this, our most sugar-coated of vegetables, has escaped the evil wand of the sugar fairy: a sugar-enhancing gene has been added to standard corn. The result is Supersweet, a cob of such heroic sugariness it should come with a dentist's warning on the wrapper. Avoid it. Unless you actually enjoy sucking sugar cubes. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: I can wolf a slice of pavlova or a sticky bun as fast as the next guy. What I have a problem with is when a vegetable, or a fruit, for that matter, has been tampered with so that its sweetness is out of proportion to its flavour. When I crunch into a hot, slithery corn cob, I want it to taste of corn, not golden syrup. </p> <p>The first of the English corn arrived only a few weeks ago and, despite our lack of sun this year, is eating well. So well, in fact, that I have had it four times already and will again tonight. There is no cheaper supper. I got six explicitly chubby cobs for a quid this morning. Just as well, because the quote for the repairs to the central heating arrived yesterday and I am still in shock. </p> <p>The first heads got their green papery husks peeled away, their strings of golden silks tugged off (so thoughtful of Mother Nature to provide us with dental floss for afterwards) and were then boiled in as much water as I could get into my largest pot. They bob about if you have the flame high, but not nearly enough to cook them evenly, so I often hold the cobs underwater with a capsized lid. Perhaps one should tie weights to them, as if you were disposing of a body in the Thames. No salt, they say, it toughens the kernels - though I must admit I have forgotten before now and it never seems to make that much difference. Boiling water, salt. It's a natural mistake. </p> <p>I approach corn in much the same way I do asparagus. Such a treat is the first of the locally grown that I do nothing more than boil-and-butter, but then, as the season moves on and the novelty thins, I get out the recipe books. </p> <p>Sweetcorn makes a velvety soup. I once had an American flatmate who would make up a vast pot for the weekend with tinned corn, thyme, bacon and, of all things, evaporated milk. It disappeared quick enough. The bacon fat settled on top in pools, holding in the soup's sweet heat. I religiously burned my tongue with every dip of the spoon, but would keep at it, like a child waggling a loose tooth. </p> <p>A soup with bacon bits and cream - what they call a chowder - is at its most wholesome when the bacon is smoked rather than 'green'. Cream and smoke always ring my bell, be it creamed kippers or that peaceful dish where you poach smoked haddock in cream and milk, then boil the cooking liquor down to a sauce_ but I am getting off the point. </p> <p>Grilled chicken and creamed corn is, like gammon and broad beans or grilled sole and creamed spinach, a perfect thing. The dish works on all counts, but especially the forkful that contains crisp, grilled skin and sweet, sloppy corn. The starch hiding in the kernels dispenses the need for any spuds. </p> <p>Depending on my level of malaise, I may use fresh corn or frozen for creaming. Sure, it is no big deal to slice the kernels off a cob, but creamed corn is one of those mysterious things I get an occasional craving for - and we all know the unwritten law of a craving is that you never, ever have its subject to hand. This, presumably, is why all-night garages sell food. I am not quite as anti the tinned or frozen corn niblet as some. I don't see the point of making a fuss when it is only going to end up in a sea of double cream and thyme. </p> <p>Two decades ago, there was a vogue for something called Chicken Maryland. Heaven on a plate for the sweet-toothed, it was a pudding masquerading as a main course: battered chicken, bacon, fried banana and, the best bit, sweetcorn fritters. My tastes have moved on a bit since then (notice I didn't say 'up'), but memories of its crunchy, greasy sweetness linger. The fritters, stripped of their battered buddies, are still worth making. Try them with the piquancy of a classic salsa verde. That'll send the sugar fairy packing. </p> <p>For those who are faced with a couple of sweetcorn cobs just too sweet to eat, I have just one word. Salt. The more salt you put on your cobs, the more the flavour of the corn will come out and the more the sweetness appears to back off. Like putting a pinch of salt in flapjacks - you taste the oats as much as the treacle. The same goes for those hybrid tomatoes, too. It may not cure swine fever, but it certainly works a treat for creeping sweetness. </p> <p><strong> Sweetcorn and bacon chowder </strong></p> <p> Serves 6 </p> <p><strong>30g butter </strong></p> <p><strong>2 plump salad onions or shallots </strong></p> <p><strong>300g smoked streaky bacon </strong></p> <p><strong>the leaves of 6 bushy sprigs of thyme </strong></p> <p><strong>4 corn cobs </strong></p> <p><strong>1.5 litres water </strong></p> <p><strong>150ml (or less) single cream </strong></p> <p><strong>a good handful of parsley </strong></p> <p>Melt the butter in a deep, heavy-based pan, the one you usually make soup in, then peel and roughly slice the onions, add them to the hot butter and let them soften over a low heat. Cut the bacon into thick chunks, about the size of a postage stamp, tearing off the rind as you go. You could use what some butchers sell off as bacon bits for this, checking them over for rind and bone, and cutting them into nuggets the size of a brazil nut. Whatever, let them fry with the onion, stirring only occasionally, so a thin layer of golden goo adheres to the pan. It will give a deep, smoky bacon flavour to the soup. </p> <p>Pull the leaves from the thyme branches and stir them in. Strip the kernels from the corn cobs - I do this by holding the cob upright on a board, one hand at the top, then slicing down with a large knife in the other. Then I turn it round and get the bit I missed at the top. You will get about 100g from each cob. Try not to catch any of the white core - it's tough. Tip the corn into the pan. </p> <p>Pour 1.5 litres of water over the sizzling bacon and corn, turn up the heat and bring it to the boil. You may get a small bit of golden froth on top, as you do with dried beans, and I think you should remove it. As the soup boils, turn down the heat so the corn rolls steadily in the simmering water. Don't be tempted to add salt - the bacon will serve for that. </p> <p>After 30 minutes, scoop out a little corn and check it for tenderness. It should be soft and, of course, sweet, with a distinct smoky flavour to it.

      "bodyText": "There is a disease in the food world more rampant than any salmonella, BSE or swine fever. It has been slowly attacking our fruit, vegetables and even meat for some time and appears unstoppable. I call it creeping sweetness. One expects a certain sweet blandness to find its way into processed food. Sugar with everything is as much a part of general dumbing down as television makeovers. But it comes as more of a surprise when you find it has been bred into your tomatoes, peas, celery and carrots. It should surprise no one to find a hefty dose of saccharin in a corn cob. It ain't called sweetcorn for nothing. Yet not even this, our most sugar-coated of vegetables, has escaped the evil wand of the sugar fairy: a sugar-enhancing gene has been added to standard corn. The result is Supersweet, a cob of such heroic sugariness it should come with a dentist's warning on the wrapper. Avoid it. Unless you actually enjoy sucking sugar cubes. Don't get me wrong: I can wolf a slice of pavlova or a sticky bun as fast as the next guy. What I have a problem with is when a vegetable, or a fruit, for that matter, has been tampered with so that its sweetness is out of proportion to its flavour. When I crunch into a hot, slithery corn cob, I want it to taste of corn, not golden syrup. The first of the English corn arrived only a few weeks ago and, despite our lack of sun this year, is eating well. So well, in fact, that I have had it four times already and will again tonight. There is no cheaper supper. I got six explicitly chubby cobs for a quid this morning. Just as well, because the quote for the repairs to the central heating arrived yesterday and I am still in shock. The first heads got their green papery husks peeled away, their strings of golden silks tugged off (so thoughtful of Mother Nature to provide us with dental floss for afterwards) and were then boiled in as much water as I could get into my largest pot. They bob about if you have the flame high, but not nearly enough to cook them evenly, so I often hold the cobs underwater with a capsized lid. Perhaps one should tie weights to them, as if you were disposing of a body in the Thames. No salt, they say, it toughens the kernels - though I must admit I have forgotten before now and it never seems to make that much difference. Boiling water, salt. It's a natural mistake. I approach corn in much the same way I do asparagus. Such a treat is the first of the locally grown that I do nothing more than boil-and-butter, but then, as the season moves on and the novelty thins, I get out the recipe books. Sweetcorn makes a velvety soup. I once had an American flatmate who would make up a vast pot for the weekend with tinned corn, thyme, bacon and, of all things, evaporated milk. It disappeared quick enough. The bacon fat settled on top in pools, holding in the soup's sweet heat. I religiously burned my tongue with every dip of the spoon, but would keep at it, like a child waggling a loose tooth. A soup with bacon bits and cream - what they call a chowder - is at its most wholesome when the bacon is smoked rather than 'green'. Cream and smoke always ring my bell, be it creamed kippers or that peaceful dish where you poach smoked haddock in cream and milk, then boil the cooking liquor down to a sauce_ but I am getting off the point. Grilled chicken and creamed corn is, like gammon and broad beans or grilled sole and creamed spinach, a perfect thing. The dish works on all counts, but especially the forkful that contains crisp, grilled skin and sweet, sloppy corn. The starch hiding in the kernels dispenses the need for any spuds. Depending on my level of malaise, I may use fresh corn or frozen for creaming. Sure, it is no big deal to slice the kernels off a cob, but creamed corn is one of those mysterious things I get an occasional craving for - and we all know the unwritten law of a craving is that you never, ever have its subject to hand. This, presumably, is why all-night garages sell food. I am not quite as anti the tinned or frozen corn niblet as some. I don't see the point of making a fuss when it is only going to end up in a sea of double cream and thyme. Two decades ago, there was a vogue for something called Chicken Maryland. Heaven on a plate for the sweet-toothed, it was a pudding masquerading as a main course: battered chicken, bacon, fried banana and, the best bit, sweetcorn fritters. My tastes have moved on a bit since then (notice I didn't say 'up'), but memories of its crunchy, greasy sweetness linger. The fritters, stripped of their battered buddies, are still worth making. Try them with the piquancy of a classic salsa verde. That'll send the sugar fairy packing. For those who are faced with a couple of sweetcorn cobs just too sweet to eat, I have just one word. Salt. The more salt you put on your cobs, the more the flavour of the corn will come out and the more the sweetness appears to back off. Like putting a pinch of salt in flapjacks - you taste the oats as much as the treacle. The same goes for those hybrid tomatoes, too. It may not cure swine fever, but it certainly works a treat for creeping sweetness. Sweetcorn and bacon chowder Serves 6 30g butter 2 plump salad onions or shallots 300g smoked streaky bacon the leaves of 6 bushy sprigs of thyme 4 corn cobs 1.5 litres water 150ml (or less) single cream a good handful of parsley Melt the butter in a deep, heavy-based pan, the one you usually make soup in, then peel and roughly slice the onions, add them to the hot butter and let them soften over a low heat. Cut the bacon into thick chunks, about the size of a postage stamp, tearing off the rind as you go. You could use what some butchers sell off as bacon bits for this, checking them over for rind and bone, and cutting them into nuggets the size of a brazil nut. Whatever, let them fry with the onion, stirring only occasionally, so a thin layer of golden goo adheres to the pan. It will give a deep, smoky bacon flavour to the soup. Pull the leaves from the thyme branches and stir them in. Strip the kernels from the corn cobs - I do this by holding the cob upright on a board, one hand at the top, then slicing down with a large knife in the other. Then I turn it round and get the bit I missed at the top. You will get about 100g from each cob. Try not to catch any of the white core - it's tough. Tip the corn into the pan. Pour 1.5 litres of water over the sizzling bacon and corn, turn up the heat and bring it to the boil. You may get a small bit of golden froth on top, as you do with dried beans, and I think you should remove it. As the soup boils, turn down the heat so the corn rolls steadily in the simmering water. Don't be tempted to add salt - the bacon will serve for that. After 30 minutes, scoop out a little corn and check it for tenderness. It should be soft and, of course, sweet, with a distinct smoky flavour to it. You can let it simmer a while longer if it doesn't seem ready. Blitz half of the soup in a blender or food processor, not quite to a smooth pur\u00e9e, but well on the way, then tip it back into the pot with the unprocessed soup. Stir in the cream and chopped parsley, and bring to the boil. Taste and season with black pepper and, carefully, with salt. The amount you need will depend on how salty your bacon is. Like most soups, this is one that benefits from being served piping hot. Creamed corn Enough for 4 as a side dish 4 cobs of sweetcorn 30g butter 100ml whipping cream Cut the kernels from the sweetcorn cobs with a large knife, then let them cook slowly over a low heat with the butter. Press hard against the stripped cobs with the knife to extract as much juice as you can. After three or four minutes, the kernels will start to soften, and their colour will brighten. Pour in the cream, season with salt and black pepper, and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and let simmer for a few minutes before serving. Corn fritters Enough for 4 You would look, naturally, to an American cookery book for a recipe as thoroughly American as a corn fritter. So where better than The Joy of Cooking by Irma S Rombauer (\u00a319.99, Simon and Schuster), the bible of United States home cooking. Cut and scrape the kernels from 5 cobs of sweetcorn. Place the corn and pulp in a large bowl and stir in 2 lightly beaten egg yolks, 2 tbsp flour, 1 tbsp sugar, tsp of salt and some black pepper. Beat 2 egg whites till the peaks are stiff but not dry. Fold the egg whites into the corn mixture. Heat 30g of butter in a large, non-stick frying pan over high heat. Drop in the batter, a heaping tablespoon at a time. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until browned on the bottom (2 to 3 minutes). Turn once, but do not pat the fritters down, and cook the second side until browned. Take care not to overcook them.

Because, in Rayner family folklore, the Hyde Park is The Scene Of The Crime.</p> <p> About five years ago, curious as to what a restaurant with three Michelin stars would deliver, we went there one wedding anniversary to sample Marco Pierre White's cooking. It cost twice as much as any meal before or since - \u00a3267 for two, as you ask - and the food was prissy, tiresome and in places thoroughly bland. Likewise, the service was so dour and pompous that I ended up wanting to punch out the entire floor staff. </p> <p>Happily, Marco long ago pushed off elsewhere. The Hyde Park has, in turn, handed its flagship restaurant over to chefs David Nicholls and Hywel Jones, who have moved it from the dingy room it used to occupy on the street side to a lighter space overlooking the park at the back. Unfortunately, the hotel has chosen to theme the space after what they could see out the window, and decided to call it Foliage, possibly the silliest name for a restaurant in London.

There is a three-course menu at dinner priced at \u00a332.50; five years ago, the same style menu in Marco's place was \u00a375. And this is very much better. </p> <p>We began with a taster of wild salmon sashimi on a pur\u00e9e of smoked aubergine with a sharp tomato vinaigrette. It was, as these sometimes silly overture dishes should be, a declaration of intent: this meal would be about flavours and textures and finding the perfect balance between them. For her starter, Pat chose a millefeuille of artichoke and baby asparagus on a gribiche dressing (chopped capers, cornichon and parsley), with a slice of truffle peeking through a translucent layer of the artichoke. (They like their truffles at Foliage. And their foie gras. And their oysters and lobster.) Granted, this was at heart a salad but, as Pat put it, the word barely does justice to a dish which managed to combine the earthiness of the artichoke and truffle with the freshness of the asparagus. </p> <p>I chose the ravioli of scallops, roast langoustines, baby leeks and truffle vinaigrette. It was a seriously popular item. Both people on the next table had it, as did half the table of six across the way, and no wonder. It represented all the virtues of the food here: precise cooking and strong presentation, while still being a serious plateful that appealed to the belly on the very basest of levels. A ring of sweetly caramelised scallops and langoustines surrounded a large ravioli, made with the lightest of pasta and an even lighter mousse, the whole on a butter sauce that had been frothed to within an inch of its life. I could eat it again and again. </p> <p>The main courses kept up the standard. My gamey Bresse pigeon came with braised white cabbage, a nugget of foie gras - to emphasise the meatiness of the dish; you wouldn't, after all, get much mileage out of a pigeon liver - and an intense celeriac bouillon. It tasted as much of the bird and of truffle as it did of the celeriac root. It was then that the incongruity struck me. You expect, on eating ballsy food like this, to look out at a pastoral landscape from which the ingredients came. It felt like country food. Instead, we were looking out over Hyde Park, and I know I would not want to eat one of the pigeons now roosting there. </p> <p>Pat's saddle of Welsh lamb with a green olive crust pulled off that clever trick of making the meat taste just as good as it smells when roasting.

That's not a small amount of money for dinner, and nobody should ever claim otherwise. But if these things matter to you - and if you're reading this column, I suspect they do - then, by god, it's worth it.

      "body": "<p>It is 4.35am. The English countryside. May. Long ago, perhaps 1974. At 19 I had discovered that getting up early, really early, exactly fitted my rhythm and psyche. The early morning was mine and like any proselytizing coloniser, I felt that I alone owned this territory. I would quietly slip out into this private world, feeling like Columbus. For those of you who have never been to dawn in mid-May - and it is, without question, the best place that there is - it bubbles with birdsong. Not like March's shrill, almost hysterical dawn chorus, but wave upon distant wave of fading, gentle song. </p> <p>Now, at the end of August, this last May - any May day - seems like another country. But that particular May morning, a repetitive metal clicking drew me down the road. Not harsh, but insistent. Round a bend and the noise is coming from the top of a pair of wooden stepladders. Mr Woodhay is cutting the hedge at four-thirty in the morning. He is a dapper man, lean, with white moustache, cap, shirt and tie even at this time of day, bicycle clips tucking in the bottom of his trousers, although as far as I knew, he did not own a bicycle. For all his slimness, his forearms are beefy and his hands like great hams. In one of them is a pair of clippers. He has already done a few yards and has perhaps another 100 or more to go, right down the lane to the crossroads. I am intruding on his early privacy as much as he is on mine. We greet each other warily, me scarcely more than a boy, him older than my father but almost apologetic. </p> <p>'Thought I'd do a bit before it got too warm.' </p> <p>'It's early.' </p> <p>'Best to be up and doing. I'm always awake anyway.' </p> <p>I knew his story. Mr Woodhay had farmed a small dairy farm all his life - 120 acres on the border with Wiltshire. Small fields, all hedged, with a coppice and a stream. His father farmed it before him. He slept in the room he was born in, surrounded by the land he cared for. This is the patchwork of fields that people sentimentalise as 'The Country', only he had not an ounce of sentiment. He loved it, deep in the bone and hardly ever expressed it. </p> <p>He had the gentleness and slow strength of a man bred to the land. He loved his herd of cows. This was a deep and true passion. You can love a herd of animals just as you can love a house or a dog or a garden. </p> <p>Then the farm's 99-year lease expired and was not renewed. He had to sell up and get out in three months. Nearly 60 and everything he ever wanted over. A lesser man would have pined publicly, bitterly. I would. But he took the job offered him by the man who threw him off the land, and became his gardener. He was a refugee, watching his new employer come home each night in his Mercedes from his agribusiness that had an office but no farmhouse, grew crops that no one loved, used land with every hedge of the 2,000 acres grubbed out. And Mr Woodhay was polite and worked hard. He was delighted at little things. He had more dignity than any dignitary I have ever met. </p> <p>They had one daughter. Married, with kiddies. If the son-in-law had been interested, they might have taken on the farm, the lease safe for another century. But it was not to be. Three years after they moved, the daughter got cancer and started to waste terrifyingly fast. After a bit, Mr Woodhay couldn't bring himself to go to the hospital to see her, his little girl. She died inside six months. He got thinner, remained scrupulously polite, even smiled, but his eyes were terrified. And he got up at dawn, just as he had done all his life, for the milking, to clip the hedges of the man who took his farm from him. </p> <p>The hedge that he was cutting that morning was not a neat, foursquare job, a yew wall working like theatrical screens or a box edge marking patterns on the ground. There was no line or rule. This was a mixed hedge which was probably all of 500 years old, running around the five-acre garden. That five acres was one field that, like all fields, had a name, Pengessen, as old as the hedge and derived from the Old English 'gaerstun', which means an enclosed meadow. Fields have names because they are places with meaning and identity. Eventually the house, a Victorian villa, also took on the name of the field. </p> <p>The hedge comprised hawthorn, hazel, ash, blackthorn, oak, elder, dog rose, holly and ivy, all growing indiscriminately. It was a rolling, lumpy thing, a bit open at the bottom, and Mr Woodhay did not try and impose any particular shape on to it, merely going the way it inclined so that it ran round the garden with an organic flow to it rather than a fierce boundary. It was a marker more than a fence. Of course, cutting a hedge in May is likely to disturb nesting birds and probably not a good idea, although his clinking shears and light trim was not as hostile as the foursquare levelling of a power hedgecutter. Shears are hard work but make a good job for a fraction of the price of a hedgecutter. </p> <p>I often think of Mr Woodhay, particularly at this time of year when I cut the hedges in my own garden. At 19, I learned from him that life is both unremittingly hard and endlessly beautiful.

      "bodyText": "It is 4.35am. The English countryside. May. Long ago, perhaps 1974. At 19 I had discovered that getting up early, really early, exactly fitted my rhythm and psyche. The early morning was mine and like any proselytizing coloniser, I felt that I alone owned this territory. I would quietly slip out into this private world, feeling like Columbus. For those of you who have never been to dawn in mid-May - and it is, without question, the best place that there is - it bubbles with birdsong. Not like March's shrill, almost hysterical dawn chorus, but wave upon distant wave of fading, gentle song. Now, at the end of August, this last May - any May day - seems like another country. But that particular May morning, a repetitive metal clicking drew me down the road. Not harsh, but insistent. Round a bend and the noise is coming from the top of a pair of wooden stepladders. Mr Woodhay is cutting the hedge at four-thirty in the morning. He is a dapper man, lean, with white moustache, cap, shirt and tie even at this time of day, bicycle clips tucking in the bottom of his trousers, although as far as I knew, he did not own a bicycle. For all his slimness, his forearms are beefy and his hands like great hams. In one of them is a pair of clippers. He has already done a few yards and has perhaps another 100 or more to go, right down the lane to the crossroads. I am intruding on his early privacy as much as he is on mine. We greet each other warily, me scarcely more than a boy, him older than my father but almost apologetic. 'Thought I'd do a bit before it got too warm.' 'It's early.' 'Best to be up and doing. I'm always awake anyway.' I knew his story. Mr Woodhay had farmed a small dairy farm all his life - 120 acres on the border with Wiltshire. Small fields, all hedged, with a coppice and a stream. His father farmed it before him. He slept in the room he was born in, surrounded by the land he cared for. This is the patchwork of fields that people sentimentalise as 'The Country', only he had not an ounce of sentiment. He loved it, deep in the bone and hardly ever expressed it. He had the gentleness and slow strength of a man bred to the land. He loved his herd of cows. This was a deep and true passion. You can love a herd of animals just as you can love a house or a dog or a garden. Then the farm's 99-year lease expired and was not renewed. He had to sell up and get out in three months. Nearly 60 and everything he ever wanted over. A lesser man would have pined publicly, bitterly. I would. But he took the job offered him by the man who threw him off the land, and became his gardener. He was a refugee, watching his new employer come home each night in his Mercedes from his agribusiness that had an office but no farmhouse, grew crops that no one loved, used land with every hedge of the 2,000 acres grubbed out. And Mr Woodhay was polite and worked hard. He was delighted at little things. He had more dignity than any dignitary I have ever met. They had one daughter. Married, with kiddies. If the son-in-law had been interested, they might have taken on the farm, the lease safe for another century. But it was not to be. Three years after they moved, the daughter got cancer and started to waste terrifyingly fast. After a bit, Mr Woodhay couldn't bring himself to go to the hospital to see her, his little girl. She died inside six months. He got thinner, remained scrupulously polite, even smiled, but his eyes were terrified. And he got up at dawn, just as he had done all his life, for the milking, to clip the hedges of the man who took his farm from him. The hedge that he was cutting that morning was not a neat, foursquare job, a yew wall working like theatrical screens or a box edge marking patterns on the ground. There was no line or rule. This was a mixed hedge which was probably all of 500 years old, running around the five-acre garden. That five acres was one field that, like all fields, had a name, Pengessen, as old as the hedge and derived from the Old English 'gaerstun', which means an enclosed meadow. Fields have names because they are places with meaning and identity. Eventually the house, a Victorian villa, also took on the name of the field. The hedge comprised hawthorn, hazel, ash, blackthorn, oak, elder, dog rose, holly and ivy, all growing indiscriminately. It was a rolling, lumpy thing, a bit open at the bottom, and Mr Woodhay did not try and impose any particular shape on to it, merely going the way it inclined so that it ran round the garden with an organic flow to it rather than a fierce boundary. It was a marker more than a fence. Of course, cutting a hedge in May is likely to disturb nesting birds and probably not a good idea, although his clinking shears and light trim was not as hostile as the foursquare levelling of a power hedgecutter. Shears are hard work but make a good job for a fraction of the price of a hedgecutter. I often think of Mr Woodhay, particularly at this time of year when I cut the hedges in my own garden. At 19, I learned from him that life is both unremittingly hard and endlessly beautiful. And that you must carry on. I also often think about gardening as a substitute for farming, that all our little patches in a row are really the farms our hunting fathers tilled. Our English obsession with hedges is because really they are psychological remnants of the irretrievable fields that time and history have made into motorways and shopping centres. Instead of thinking of the garden as a series of outdoor 'rooms', perhaps we should more helpfully see it as a jumble of small fields, enclosed meadows, carved out of the wildwood that are our cities and suburbs and housing estates. The etymology of 'garden' is the same as yard and garth, and derives from the Old English 'geard', meaning enclosure or hedge. So, a hedged enclosure is the exact definition of a garden, just as it is of a field. 'The Country' to most Englishmen is a hedged, farmed place. Every stupid, greedy farmer that rips out another hedgerow is despised not just because he is doing irreparable damage to the balance of the ecology for short-term gain but because he is clawing at the guts of the landscape and reaching into the viscera of our own gardens.

There are plenty of short, scenic routes that make ideal weekend breaks for all ages and abilities, and since most are quite easy and straightforward you won't need huge backpacks or mountain skills. </p> <p>Plus they're full of interest, often reflecting local historical and cultural themes: you can step out with William the Conqueror as he lands on English soil for the first time; or retrace the journey of protesting villagers rallying to the Monmouth Rebellion in the West Country. The Cistercian Way links a number of religious sites in south Cumbria, while the Lead Mining Trail follows packhorse routes across the moors of Upper Weardale in search of a bygone industry. </p> <p>The trails are each about 25-30 miles long, and ideal for a weekend or leisurely three-day break. They are all described by a book or leaflet guide, and in some cases their precise routes are even shown on the Ordnance Survey's new Explorer maps. Local tourist information centres can offer accommodation advice - even book a bed for you in advance. It's the perfect introduction to trail-walking in Britain - and before you know it you'll get the bug and be eager to discover the likes of the Witches Way (Lancashire), Landsker Borderland Trail (Pembrokeshire), Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk (Derbyshire), Forest Way (Essex), and Abbeys Way (Lothian).

Along the way are the castles of Pevensey and the moated Herstmonceux, with a mid-point stop at the town of Battle, site of Harold's famous defeat. Visit the abbey and battlefield exhibition, then continue eastwards via vineyards and quiet farmland to the historic Cinque ports of Winchelsea and Rye.

      "bodyText": "Britain boasts more than 500 separate walking trails of 20 miles or more, so if you don't have the time or the legs for the Pennine Way why not try something a little more manageable instead? There are plenty of short, scenic routes that make ideal weekend breaks for all ages and abilities, and since most are quite easy and straightforward you won't need huge backpacks or mountain skills. Plus they're full of interest, often reflecting local historical and cultural themes: you can step out with William the Conqueror as he lands on English soil for the first time; or retrace the journey of protesting villagers rallying to the Monmouth Rebellion in the West Country. The Cistercian Way links a number of religious sites in south Cumbria, while the Lead Mining Trail follows packhorse routes across the moors of Upper Weardale in search of a bygone industry. The trails are each about 25-30 miles long, and ideal for a weekend or leisurely three-day break. They are all described by a book or leaflet guide, and in some cases their precise routes are even shown on the Ordnance Survey's new Explorer maps. Local tourist information centres can offer accommodation advice - even book a bed for you in advance. It's the perfect introduction to trail-walking in Britain - and before you know it you'll get the bug and be eager to discover the likes of the Witches Way (Lancashire), Landsker Borderland Trail (Pembrokeshire), Bonnie Prince Charlie Walk (Derbyshire), Forest Way (Essex), and Abbeys Way (Lothian). Time to get those boots polished! 1066 country walk, East Sussex Start: Pevensey, East Sussex Finish: Rye, East Sussex Distance: 31 miles Route guide/accom: Free leaflet from Tourist Information Centre, 88 High Street, Battle, East Sussex TN33 0AQ, tel 01424 773721, e-mail battletic@rother.gov.uk. Maps: OS Explorer 124: Hastings &amp; Bexhill (route shown) This straightforward lowland route loosely follows in the footsteps of William, Duke of Normandy, after his landing at Pevensey Bay in 1066. Along the way are the castles of Pevensey and the moated Herstmonceux, with a mid-point stop at the town of Battle, site of Harold's famous defeat. Visit the abbey and battlefield exhibition, then continue eastwards via vineyards and quiet farmland to the historic Cinque ports of Winchelsea and Rye. Both Pevensey and Rye have railway stations, and apart from being shown on the Explorer map, the route is also indicated on the ground by special waymarks with directional arrows. Ouse Valley way, Cambridgeshire Start: Eaton Socon (near St Neots), Cambs Finish: Earith (near St Ives), Cambs Distance: 26 miles Route guide/accom: Leaflet pack (50p incl postage) from Tourist Information Centre, Princes Street, Huntingdon, Cambs PE18 6PH, tel 01480 388588, e-mail Hunts.TIC@huntsdc.gov.uk. Maps: OS Explorer 208: Bedford &amp; St Neots, and 225: Huntingdon &amp; St Ives (route shown) An easy, flat path alongside the River Great Ouse in the district of Huntingdonshire. Shown on the ground by a waymark depicting a pair of swans, the route passes through traditional arable and meadowland into the landscape of the fens - but beware flooding in the winter and spring. Submerged gravel pits provide home to a range of wildfowl, and there's also much of interest in the old towns of St Neots, Godmanchester and St Ives visited along the way (nature trail and town trail leaflets are also available). Liberty Trail, Somerset/Dorset Start: Ham Hill, South Somerset Finish: Lyme Regis, Dorset Distance: 28 miles Route guide/accom: Booklet pack (\u00a34.25 plus 60p p&amp;p) from South Somerset Tourist Information Centre, Petter's House, Petter's Way, Yeovil, Somerset BA20 1SH, tel 01935 471279, e-mail yeoviltic@southsomerset.gov.uk. Maps: OS Explorer 116: Lyme Regis &amp; Bridport, and 129: Yeovil &amp; Sherborne (route shown) The Liberty Trail follows the route taken by villagers from Somerset and Dorset who in 1685 flocked to the coast to greet the Duke of Monmouth, Charles II's illegitimate son and beacon of Protestant protest. The short-lived Monmouth Rebellion ended bloodily at Sedgemoor, and the guide looks at the stories of some of the ordinary people who took part. Today's route via Crewkerne and Forde Abbey also visits several Iron Age hillforts on its way to the sea. It's mostly low and undulating farmland, which may become muddy after wet weather, and is waymarked by distinctive yellow discs. Saints way, Cornwall Start: Padstow, Cornwall Finish: Fowey, Cornwall Distance: 26 miles Route guide/accom: Booklet (\u00a33.99 plus 75p p&amp;p) from Tourist Information Centre, 4 Custom House Hill, Fowey, Cornwall PL23 1AB, tel 01726 833616, e-mail foweytic@visit.co.uk Maps: OS Explorer 106: Newquay &amp; Padstow and 107: St Austell &amp; Liskeard (route shown) The Saints Way or 'Forth an Syns' is Cornwall's coast-to-coast route, a cross-country wander linking the estuaries of the Camel and the Fowey and mirroring the journey made by the early saints, holy men and traders from Cornwall and Wales. The route follows paths and quiet country lanes via St Breock Downs and Helman Tor, and is waymarked on the ground by the distinctive Celtic cross. It links a number of religious sites, including chapels, holy wells and standing stones. Three Castles walk, Monmouthshire Start and finish: Skenfrith, near Monmouth Distance: 19 miles Guide/accom: Guidebook (\u00a33.95 plus 50p p&amp;p) from Tourist Information Centre, Shire Hall, Agincourt Square, Monmouth NP25 3DY, tel 01600 713899, e-mail Monmouth.tic@tsww.com. Maps: OS Outdoor Leisure 13: Brecon Beacons Eastern area, and 14: Wye Valley &amp; Forest of Dean This short circular route close to the Monmouthshire/Herefordshire border links the so-called 'Trilateral' castles. Skenfrith, Grosmont and White Castle were built by the Normans to form a line of defence along the Welsh Marches, and also proved handy for Edward I in his attempts to counter the threat from Llewellyn the Last. The waymarked route winds its way through valleys and wooded hillsides. Rhymney Valley Ridgeway walk, Mid Glamorgan Start and finish: Caerphilly Common Distance: 29 miles Guide: Contact Caerphilly Mountain Countryside Service, Taff Gorge Countryside Centre, Heol-y-Fforest, Tongwynlais, Cardiff CF15 7JR, tel 029 2081 3356; accom details from Tourist Information Centre, Twyn Square, Caerphilly, Mid Glamorgan CF8 1XX tel 029 2088 0011, e-mail tic@caerphilly.gov.uk.

Natural attractions include vivid red sandstone outcrops and mysterious caves, plus the little-known Delamere Forest and Peckforton Hills. A revised leaflet guide is expected shortly, detailing new extensions into Frodsham and Whitchurch town centres. However, the main route is also shown on the latest Explorer maps, and waymarked with yellow and black footprint signs. Cistercian way, Cumbria Start: Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria Finish: Roa Island, Cumbria Distance: 33 miles/53km Guide/accom: Free leaflet from Tourist Information Centre, Victoria Hall, Main Street, Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria LA11 6DP, tel 015395 34026 Maps: OS Landranger 96: Barrow in Furness &amp; South Lakeland (route shown) The leaflet guide provides an overview to a trail that is waymarked on the ground by a logo featuring a walking monk with a staff.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair is coming under fierce pressure to talk up the political case for the euro or risk undermining the Yes campaign. </p> <p>The Government and the Labour Party have been warned that mixed messages from the pro-single currency camp in the Danish referendum campaign - widely seen as a dry run for a vote in Britain - damaged the cause. </p> <p>And AEEU leader Sir Ken Jackson, a close ally of the Prime Minister who has also been working with the Danish union movement, will use a speech next week to urge a more explicit lead from the Government. </p> <p>'The consensus from Denmark is that we should not be frightened of engaging with the public about the benefits of being in Europe,' said Jackson, who has appealed on Danish TV for a Yes vote. </p> <p>'Autumn will be a key campaigning time and I think the euro will be the dominant theme. I hope that the Government recognises the fears that business and many trade unions have, and sharpens its focus on preparation. We do need a clearer line - many inward investors are very worried that the Government is not committed enough to joining.' </p> <p>British pro-Europeans - whose tactics so far have been to warn that jobs will be lost unless the country joins, rather than extolling the political advantages of closer union - have carefully avoided being seen to interfere in Denmark, where the vote is on a knife-edge. </p> <p>But Britain in Europe's Simon Buckby and Labour MP Nick Palmer, a Danish-born backbench aide to the Minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, have both spent time in Denmark over the summer observing the campaign. Both have reported back that tactical errors among the Danish pro-euro group should not be repeated here. </p> <p>Palmer said the Danish Yes camp initially campaigned on economic grounds, even though, since the Danish krone was already shadowing the euro, it was not clear that joining would make much difference economically. </p> <p>'People were not terribly impressed by that. Then the Danish \"wise men\", their three economic experts, published a report which said that it didn't matter much either way, which hardly helped,' he said. </p> <p>'Meanwhile the antis had been arguing a political line about sovereignty and \"keep the krone\". But the pros have now swung to arguing the political line too, saying let's be in the driving seat of Europe, and that seems to have had a modest impact. </p> <p>'Interestingly, the same debate about whether it is an economic or political issue is coming up here - the pro camp here is arguing that it is primarily economic, but I think it's both.' </p> <p>Insiders say Buckby, too, has been warning for some weeks that the political and economic case must be made together. </p> <p>Senior Foreign Office sources believe the Danish result is too close to call, with some predicting a narrow Yes vote and others a No that would be a devastating setback for the British pro-Europeans. </p> <p>The next three weeks will see the issue rise back up the political agenda. On 6 September, Jackson will also share a Britain in Europe platform with the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy.</p>",

And AEEU leader Sir Ken Jackson, a close ally of the Prime Minister who has also been working with the Danish union movement, will use a speech next week to urge a more explicit lead from the Government. 'The consensus from Denmark is that we should not be frightened of engaging with the public about the benefits of being in Europe,' said Jackson, who has appealed on Danish TV for a Yes vote. 'Autumn will be a key campaigning time and I think the euro will be the dominant theme. I hope that the Government recognises the fears that business and many trade unions have, and sharpens its focus on preparation. We do need a clearer line - many inward investors are very worried that the Government is not committed enough to joining.' British pro-Europeans - whose tactics so far have been to warn that jobs will be lost unless the country joins, rather than extolling the political advantages of closer union - have carefully avoided being seen to interfere in Denmark, where the vote is on a knife-edge. But Britain in Europe's Simon Buckby and Labour MP Nick Palmer, a Danish-born backbench aide to the Minister for Europe, Keith Vaz, have both spent time in Denmark over the summer observing the campaign. Both have reported back that tactical errors among the Danish pro-euro group should not be repeated here. Palmer said the Danish Yes camp initially campaigned on economic grounds, even though, since the Danish krone was already shadowing the euro, it was not clear that joining would make much difference economically. 'People were not terribly impressed by that. Then the Danish \"wise men\", their three economic experts, published a report which said that it didn't matter much either way, which hardly helped,' he said. 'Meanwhile the antis had been arguing a political line about sovereignty and \"keep the krone\". But the pros have now swung to arguing the political line too, saying let's be in the driving seat of Europe, and that seems to have had a modest impact. 'Interestingly, the same debate about whether it is an economic or political issue is coming up here - the pro camp here is arguing that it is primarily economic, but I think it's both.' Insiders say Buckby, too, has been warning for some weeks that the political and economic case must be made together. Senior Foreign Office sources believe the Danish result is too close to call, with some predicting a narrow Yes vote and others a No that would be a devastating setback for the British pro-Europeans. The next three weeks will see the issue rise back up the political agenda. On 6 September, Jackson will also share a Britain in Europe platform with the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy.",

In one of the leaked memos by which policy is conducted these days, Tony Blair is quoted as saying: 'The truth is the politics is overwhelmingly in favour, but the economics have to be right and at present, it is not.'

One measure of this is the change in the pattern of weights used to calculate sterling's effective exchange rate index.

Thus, if sterling was going to be locked in against the dollar it wouldn't take very long to agree a parity of $1.50. However, any euro parity would be highly contentious. </p> <p>What all this demonstrates is the importance of capital flows as against trade flows in exchange-rate determination. Not all of these capital flows are volatile, speculative transactions. When it comes to foreign direct investment, the US is much more important than the EU. We don't hear very much about the impact on British investment in the US, or vice versa, if sterling were to join the euro and as a result become much more volatile against the dollar. </p> <p>Recently I attended the annual meeting of Pilkington, a global company with half its turnover in the EU, but with one quarter in North America. In response to a question the chairman, Sir Nigel Rudd, stated that Pilkington had no corporate position on whether or not sterling should be replaced by the euro.

It has been involved in the European project from the beginning, if at times hesitantly. It fulfils the convergence criteria except for inflation, and its own currency, the krone, is rock solid.</p> <p>But it is emotion, not economic reason, which is driving the No campaign.

Most newspapers and big business and the entire trade union movement are also ready to bid 'farvel' to the krone. And the Yes camp is much better funded than the No camp after it scooped most of the 25 million kroner (\u00a32m) in public funds earmarked to fight the campaign.</p> <p>The No side is a rag-tag coalition of the extreme right and left and a couple of die-hard eurosceptic grass-roots organisations. They have little in common and in some cases loathe one another.</p> <p>The right-wing element, the ultra-nationalist Danish People's Party (DPP) or Dansk Folkeparti, wants to see paedophiles castrated, aid to the third world privatised, refugees repatriated and Denmark kept for the Danes. Many of its members compare the euro project to Hitler's failed attempt to foist the Reichsmark on occupied Europe: 'The technique is about combining power. Hitler wanted to combine power in his hands and the European Commission wants to combine power in its hands,' says Mogens Camre, a Euro MP for the party. The euro has been embraced, he adds, by 'frail, weak, badly run and corrupted' countries.</p> <p>The DPP may be extreme but the Danes are listening to what it has to say on the euro.</p> <p>The campaign is typically Danish: low key, civilised and orderly. The Yes camp has its 'euro truck' which tours the country providing a platform for high-profile government politicians to take the debate to the far-flung corners of Jutland. And the No side has its 'krone car'.</p> <p>The news is full of little else, and public hearings and TV debates are in full swing. The arguments are well rehearsed. The Yes side believes ditching the krone and embracing the euro is a small price to pay for greater influence within the EU and financial stability. They shudder when they talk about 1998, the year the krone had to be defended three times from speculative attack.</p> <p>Denmark's economic independence is in any case illusory, they insist, since the krone has been pegged to the Deutchmark and later the euro since 1982. So what is there to lose?</p> <p>'It's about influence,' says Anders Panum Jensen, the youthful secretary-general of the Danish European Movement. 'Outside the euro we lose influence on economic issues, especially in the euro zone. How much will other politicians pay attention to Danish arguments when we are not part of the core group?'</p> <p>Lars Kjolbye, international secretary of the Danish Conservative Party, agrees: 'The Danish currency is not in a position to stand alone if we remain outside the euro. We will be dependent on the decisions made by the euro 12 anyway. Denmark is better off if we have a place at the table.'</p> <p>He insists Denmark will not be giving up sovereignty. 'Do you think the French and Germans would abolish the franc and mark if they thought they were giving away their sovereignty?' he laughs.</p> <p>The idea that Denmark will be relegated to the margins of Europe as a bit player, ignored and excluded from the club and defenceless in the face of globalisation, resurfaces again and again. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democrat prime minister and architect of the referendum, has argued passionately that his country must join the euro or face obscurity. 'Denmark must be where the decisions are taken. It is unacceptable that we should not have any influence on the decisions which ultimately affect our everyday lives,' he told the Folketinget in May.</p> <p>Both sides are agreed on one thing: this is the most important referendum in Danish history and will be a decisive moment for Denmark's relationship with the rest of Europe.</p> <p>DPP board member Carl Christian Ebbesen outlines the far-right's case for a No vote. 'We don't look at it as an economic project. We are fighting to keep the krone and to keep the values of Danish society. By that we mean keeping control of Danish society in Danish hands. Denmark will have to be like other European countries and we don't want that. If there is a Yes vote the politicians will create a federal union, but we like to be Danes and do it our way,' he says.</p> <p>Holger Nielsen, dynamic leader of the Danish Socialist People's Party, the other main party campaigning against the euro, is keen to distance himself from the DPP. 'The euro is not a question of being conservative but of democracy. It's important for us to stress that it's not a right-wing or xenophobic position. It's not fair to say that resistance is built on right-wing values,' he said in an interview with The Observer.</p> <p>'But if you have a common currency, political power will be transferred from national parliaments to Brussels, to bureaucrats and technocrats. When you have an economic union you also have a political union.' And that, he adds, is bad for democracy.</p> <p>Denmark could be in the EU and outside the euro, he adds, and still be 'a good European'. Nielsen also worries that a decision to join the euro could lead to Denmark's fabled tax-financed 'Rolls-Royce' welfare state being fatally weakened and that people would be forced to start paying health insurance in the name of harmonisation. This strikes a chord with many Danes.</p> <p>What does not go down well here is outside intervention. Efforts by British Tories to raise money for the No campaign are widely mocked and despised, and almost every naysayer agrees that they can only backfire, turning off large numbers of left-wing voters. Yet on 3 September, Daniel Hannan, a Tory MEP for south-east England, will address a rally of the far-right DPP and urge the Danes to say No. The Yes camp can't wait.</p> <p>Denmark's sixth referendum on the EU is shaping up to be explosive. When the Danes said no to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it rocked the EU and triggered a series of currency crises. Anarchists rioted in the Norrebro suburb of Copenhagen and police had to open fire.</p> <p>There are likely to be fewer fireworks on 28 September but the consequences could be just as far-reaching. If Denmark says Yes, Britain will find itself increasingly isolated outside the euro and the single currency will have absorbed one of Europe's strongest economies.</p> <p><b>There is nothing like a Dane...</b><br></p> <p>Denmark is known as the 'footnote' country because of the special exceptions it has negotiated in European treaties.</p> <p><b> History</b></p> <p>Constitutional monarchy.

'Do you think the French and Germans would abolish the franc and mark if they thought they were giving away their sovereignty?' he laughs. The idea that Denmark will be relegated to the margins of Europe as a bit player, ignored and excluded from the club and defenceless in the face of globalisation, resurfaces again and again. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democrat prime minister and architect of the referendum, has argued passionately that his country must join the euro or face obscurity. 'Denmark must be where the decisions are taken. It is unacceptable that we should not have any influence on the decisions which ultimately affect our everyday lives,' he told the Folketinget in May. Both sides are agreed on one thing: this is the most important referendum in Danish history and will be a decisive moment for Denmark's relationship with the rest of Europe. DPP board member Carl Christian Ebbesen outlines the far-right's case for a No vote. 'We don't look at it as an economic project. We are fighting to keep the krone and to keep the values of Danish society. By that we mean keeping control of Danish society in Danish hands. Denmark will have to be like other European countries and we don't want that. If there is a Yes vote the politicians will create a federal union, but we like to be Danes and do it our way,' he says. Holger Nielsen, dynamic leader of the Danish Socialist People's Party, the other main party campaigning against the euro, is keen to distance himself from the DPP. 'The euro is not a question of being conservative but of democracy. It's important for us to stress that it's not a right-wing or xenophobic position. It's not fair to say that resistance is built on right-wing values,' he said in an interview with The Observer. 'But if you have a common currency, political power will be transferred from national parliaments to Brussels, to bureaucrats and technocrats. When you have an economic union you also have a political union.' And that, he adds, is bad for democracy. Denmark could be in the EU and outside the euro, he adds, and still be 'a good European'. Nielsen also worries that a decision to join the euro could lead to Denmark's fabled tax-financed 'Rolls-Royce' welfare state being fatally weakened and that people would be forced to start paying health insurance in the name of harmonisation. This strikes a chord with many Danes. What does not go down well here is outside intervention. Efforts by British Tories to raise money for the No campaign are widely mocked and despised, and almost every naysayer agrees that they can only backfire, turning off large numbers of left-wing voters. Yet on 3 September, Daniel Hannan, a Tory MEP for south-east England, will address a rally of the far-right DPP and urge the Danes to say No. The Yes camp can't wait. Denmark's sixth referendum on the EU is shaping up to be explosive. When the Danes said no to the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, it rocked the EU and triggered a series of currency crises. Anarchists rioted in the Norrebro suburb of Copenhagen and police had to open fire. There are likely to be fewer fireworks on 28 September but the consequences could be just as far-reaching. If Denmark says Yes, Britain will find itself increasingly isolated outside the euro and the single currency will have absorbed one of Europe's strongest economies. There is nothing like a Dane... Denmark is known as the 'footnote' country because of the special exceptions it has negotiated in European treaties. History Constitutional monarchy. Head of state: Queen Margrethe II. Heir apparent: Crown Prince Frederik. Head of government: Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leads Social Democratic minority government. Post-war highlights. 1948: Granted Faroes home rule. 1949: Founding member of Nato. 1973: Joined European Community after a referendum. 1979: Granted Greenland home rule. 1992: Voted 'no' to Maastricht. 1993: Narrowly voted 'yes' in a second referendum. People Population 5.3 million. English is the main second language. Society Welfare state. Danes enjoy a high standard of living, but also have a poor health record, blamed on beer and cigarettes.

      "body": "<p>In 1980 THEY were just a gang of neo-Nazi skinheads who spent their time disrupting concerts by the Specials and the Beat or breaking up anti-racist punk gigs in Belfast.</p> <p>They followed Offensive Weapon, a band modelled on British Nazi-skins groups. They wore 'Hang Nelson Mandela' T-shirts and gave pro-Hitler press interviews saying that he should have 'gassed the Taigs (a pejorative word for Catholics) as well'.</p> <p>Twenty-years later these 30 to 40 young loyalists, who formed the core of the now defunct National Front branch in Belfast, are now the cadre of Johnny Adair's C company of the Ulster Freedom Fighters - the assassination arm of the Ulster Defence Association.</p> <p>These men, who are at the centre of the current Ulster loyalist feud that has claimed three lives, have been ferociously loyal to each other over the last two decades. They went to school together, they fought running street battles with Catholic Skin head gangs, they were inducted into the UDA around the same time in the Eighties and they plotted and killed in the Nineties.</p> <p>The old Shankill skinhead alterk\u00e4mpfen (old comrades) include Sam 'Scally' McCrory who was imprisoned for terrorism and met Mo Mowlam, then Northern Ireland Secretary, during her visit to the the Maze in 1998 to beg the UDA to stop killing Catholics. McCrory has 'White power' tattooed on his right hand.</p> <p>Several of C company's main killers were also in the skinhead gang. Another is a young loyalist nicknamed Top Gun because of his involvement in scores of sectarian murders. One of the armed and masked UFF men who stopped cars at a televised terrorist checkpoint a fortnight ago was a former NF skinhead and a close friend of Adair. Adair himself was a member of the NF Skinz, who graduated from soccer hooliganism to terrorism.</p> <p>A senior RUC officer has watched C company's trajectory from skinheads to sectarian assassins: 'The community on the Shankill is reaping what they sow. These boys were once just an ordinary gang of thugs who were then elevated into defenders of the people. Now they are turning on their own people.</p> <p>'They are not just motivated by drugs, that's facile. Intelligent drug dealers don't draw attention to themselves by going to armed displays and starting feuds with the UVF. These people are fanatical loyalists who want the war to start again.'</p> <p>Even with their leader back in prison this weekend, the police officer said this closely knit group still has the capability to cause mayhem and sectarian carnage on the streets of Greater Belfast.</p> <p>Their stronghold is the Lower Shankill estate, a maze of publicly owned houses close to the nationalist Unity Flats and Antrim Road. Unemployment is high, educational achievement low. The drabness of the estate is lit up by the large number of paramilitary murals dedicated to C company's exploits as well as red, white and blue paving stones and flags of the UDA.</p> <p>When the inter-loyalist violence erupted on the Shankill Road last Saturday, C company's first move was to 'cleanse' their base of any supporters of the rival Ulster Volunteer Force.</p> <p>Thirty-six families were forced out; some of whose homes were torched and vandalised. Some of the families were targeted because their sons played in the Shankill Protestant Boys, a flute band with UVF connections. By the middle of last week anyone with even a tentative link to the UVF had been forcibly expelled from the Lower Shankill estate.</p> <p>Agnes Street links the Shankill with the Crumlin Road where UFF member Jackie Coulter and former loyalist activist Bobby Mahood were killed on Monday. For Shankill residents the street has become the dividing line between the two halves of their community.

      "bodyText": "In 1980 THEY were just a gang of neo-Nazi skinheads who spent their time disrupting concerts by the Specials and the Beat or breaking up anti-racist punk gigs in Belfast. They followed Offensive Weapon, a band modelled on British Nazi-skins groups. They wore 'Hang Nelson Mandela' T-shirts and gave pro-Hitler press interviews saying that he should have 'gassed the Taigs (a pejorative word for Catholics) as well'. Twenty-years later these 30 to 40 young loyalists, who formed the core of the now defunct National Front branch in Belfast, are now the cadre of Johnny Adair's C company of the Ulster Freedom Fighters - the assassination arm of the Ulster Defence Association. These men, who are at the centre of the current Ulster loyalist feud that has claimed three lives, have been ferociously loyal to each other over the last two decades. They went to school together, they fought running street battles with Catholic Skin head gangs, they were inducted into the UDA around the same time in the Eighties and they plotted and killed in the Nineties. The old Shankill skinhead alterk\u00e4mpfen (old comrades) include Sam 'Scally' McCrory who was imprisoned for terrorism and met Mo Mowlam, then Northern Ireland Secretary, during her visit to the the Maze in 1998 to beg the UDA to stop killing Catholics. McCrory has 'White power' tattooed on his right hand. Several of C company's main killers were also in the skinhead gang. Another is a young loyalist nicknamed Top Gun because of his involvement in scores of sectarian murders. One of the armed and masked UFF men who stopped cars at a televised terrorist checkpoint a fortnight ago was a former NF skinhead and a close friend of Adair. Adair himself was a member of the NF Skinz, who graduated from soccer hooliganism to terrorism. A senior RUC officer has watched C company's trajectory from skinheads to sectarian assassins: 'The community on the Shankill is reaping what they sow. These boys were once just an ordinary gang of thugs who were then elevated into defenders of the people. Now they are turning on their own people. 'They are not just motivated by drugs, that's facile. Intelligent drug dealers don't draw attention to themselves by going to armed displays and starting feuds with the UVF. These people are fanatical loyalists who want the war to start again.' Even with their leader back in prison this weekend, the police officer said this closely knit group still has the capability to cause mayhem and sectarian carnage on the streets of Greater Belfast. Their stronghold is the Lower Shankill estate, a maze of publicly owned houses close to the nationalist Unity Flats and Antrim Road. Unemployment is high, educational achievement low. The drabness of the estate is lit up by the large number of paramilitary murals dedicated to C company's exploits as well as red, white and blue paving stones and flags of the UDA. When the inter-loyalist violence erupted on the Shankill Road last Saturday, C company's first move was to 'cleanse' their base of any supporters of the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. Thirty-six families were forced out; some of whose homes were torched and vandalised. Some of the families were targeted because their sons played in the Shankill Protestant Boys, a flute band with UVF connections. By the middle of last week anyone with even a tentative link to the UVF had been forcibly expelled from the Lower Shankill estate. Agnes Street links the Shankill with the Crumlin Road where UFF member Jackie Coulter and former loyalist activist Bobby Mahood were killed on Monday. For Shankill residents the street has become the dividing line between the two halves of their community. The Lower Shankill is now a UFF/UDA-controlled zone, the middle Shankill Road is a UVF dominated sector. Throughout last week Chris McGimpsey, an Ulster Unionist councillor for the area and an ally of his party leader David Trimble, worked around the clock to re-house the 36 families forced out by the UFF. Up until last Friday his office, which is equidistant from the UVF and UDA headquarters on the Shankill, was packed with displaced, anxious men, women and children seeking new homes. Today's C company are second generation loyalists who followed the example of men such as John White, the chairman of the UDA's political wing, the Ulster Democratic Party. White was jailed for a double murder in the Seventies and on his release in 1991 became a hero to younger loyalists like Adair. White supports the Good Friday Agreement but many of the young men he inspired to join the UFF are sceptical about the peace process believing it is loaded in favour of republicanism. The UDP has lost the political argument with influential UDA/UFF units like C company, which are bound together solely by a visceral hatred of all Catholics and nationalists. Large sections of the British and Irish media have sought to portray the feud as nothing more than a squalid turf war over drugs, criminal rackets and territory. But these are secondary factors. The most important antecedent of the current slaughter is the sharp division between pro- and anti-Agreement wings of violent loyalism. The Ulster Volunteer Force is the oldest of the loyalist terror groups. It is descended from Sir Edward Carson's private army founded in 1912 to resist Home Rule for Ireland. Its present leadership has been in place for more than 20 years and is organised along strict centrist lines, whereas the UDA is run by collective leadership with individual brigadiers who are given considerable freedom to do what they like. The UVF's political representatives, the Progressive Unionist Party, has some of the most articulate loyalists in its ranks. David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, both members of the Northern Ireland Assembly, are household names in both parts of Ireland. Their political analysis is that unionists and loyalists should work the Agreement for their benefit, that the peace deal is predicted on the principle that Northern Ireland cannot leave the UK without the consent of its people. The present feud follows the pattern of earlier UVF-UDA conflicts. In the mid 1970s there were two vicious feuds at a time of constitutional uncertainty and change. One organisation, the UVF, looked for a political way forward reaching out for compromise with republicans and nationalists. The other sought to gain hegemony within the Protestant community by becoming more sectarian and belligerent and by painting the UVF as crypto-communists and 'Fenian lovers'. What is really occurring on the narrow streets off the Shankill Road this weekend is a struggle for the future of Ulster loyalism. One section of the UDA in Protestant West Belfast is sliding inexorably back to wider conflict with Irish nationalists as well as their fellow loyalists. The UVF, however, wants no part in renewed sectarian warfare although it claims it has no choice but to stand and fight rival loyalists for its survival. Most disturbing of all is the third generation of junior UFF members, the Ulster Young Militants, who were behind many of the attacks on UVF homes in the Lower Shankill last weekend. According to born-again Christian Pastor Jack McKee, the UFF and to a lesser degree the UVF have been recruiting hundreds of teenagers from the area, preparing them for war when Northern Ireland is meant to be at peace. In some schools, McKee said, members of the rival loyalist youth wings have to be let out of different gates at the end of the school day to avoid clashes. Many of the UYM were wearing T-shirts glorifying Adair and C company along the Shankill over the last week. Beneath pictures of Adair and a row of masked men brandishing machine guns and Kalashnikov rifles were the words: 'C company, simply the best'. Who would have thought that the skinhead gang that ran amok at a Specials concert in the Ulster Hall 20 years ago, chasing ska fans including this writer into the back stage, would evolve into a small but ruthless terrorist unit capable of threatening 10 years of talks, peace deals and historic compromises?",

It is understood the Secretary of State wants more of Adair's associates in the Ulster Defence Association put behind bars. Evidence is being drawn up this weekend which senior RUC officers believe could lead to the conviction of two of the UDA leader's colleagues from the Lower Shankill area. They are often seen in Adair's company and flanked him during recent public displays at Drumcree and in the Lower Shankill. Meanwhile, detectives investigating the murder of Sam Rockett during the loyalist feud have arrested three men in north Belfast. The arrests were made yesterday in the Crumlin Road area hours before Rockett was buried. Gunmen shot him dead in front of his girlfriend on Wednesday evening. Rockett is believed to have had links with the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. An RUC spokesman said a number of items had been taken away for forensic examination. Rockett was buried amid tight security and the media was kept clear.

Mahood's family claimed he and Coulter were in his jeep discussing ways of ending the feud when the gunman struck. The greater Shankill area continues to resemble an armed camp with army and police vehicles blocking arterial routes. Mandelson said yesterday that jailing convicted UDA leader Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair would discourage those considering a return to sectarian warfare. 'What I think his removal does is clear the way for the differences between the loyalist organisations to be settled peacefully. 'It is very important that loyalism - which has a legitimate role to play in Northern Ireland - is reintegrated into the political process.' He said he was encouraged that only a small number of people turned out to protest at Adair's re-incarceration. He stressed that Adair will not be released in the immediate future. He is being held in the fully integrated Maghaberry prison outside Lisburn. It is understood that Adair could face further charges which, if he is convicted, could mean he would spend more time in jail.

      "bodyText": "US-style 'televangelism', currently banned from national airwaves, could be allowed into Britain. Under heavy pressure from some Christian groups, the Government is considering allowing religious groups the right to apply for terrestrial radio licences in this autumn's White Paper. Religious groups have been prevented from running radio and television stations of the kind common in the United States because of worries about the excesses of American preachers, well known for their extremist views. But the Christian lobby is pushing hard for a change in the law and is threatening to sue the Government under human rights legislation unless it gives in. Broadcasting Minister Janet Anderson has held several meetings over the summer with interdenominational charity United Christian Broadcasters (UCB), which already has two local satellite licences but is blocked from getting the national terrestrial licence it wants for a mass audience. 'If you have a national media, the fact that you would exclude Christians from it is extraordinary,' said Olave Snelling of the Christian Broadcasting Council, which is backing the legal case. 'Probably there is a fear of cults, but I would have thought the Government could hedge these things around with all sorts of caveats in legislative terms,' she added. Government insiders, however, say it is difficult to define in law which religious groups would be eligible. There is also intense competition for spare frequencies on Britain's crowded airwaves, with new slots going to stations with the widest appeal. 'Christianity is very much a minority pursuit,' said National Secular Society secretary Keith Porteous-Wood. 'We are concerned about vulnerable people receiving radio broadcasts in their own home.' However, a paper from UCB managing director Gareth Littler, submitted to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's White Paper review, insists that 'legitimate religious groups such as UCB' should be treated 'in the same way as our secular counterparts in terms of broadcasting ownership and content regulation.' It adds that only a change in the 1990 Broadcasting Act would avoid 'discrimination against legitimate religious organisations in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights.' The group has engaged David Pannick QC and is already pursuing a case. UCB currently broadcasts from its Stoke-on-Trent base via satellite a menu of prayer, music and Bible teachings but wants a national audience. A spokesman for the Department of Culture said: 'Ministers are well aware of this campaign and it is among the things they are considering in drawing up the White Paper.' Details of the legislation, including control of programme content rules on cross-media ownership, will be discussed next month by its authors Chris Smith and Trade Secretary Stephen Byers.

He has visited several loyalist prisoners in Maghaberry, including Pastor Clifford Peeples, who tried to scald Crossan with boiling water earlier this year. Now Adair is living cheek-by-jowl with Crossan and his CIRA comrades in Maghaberry. Crossan is serving 10 years for conspiracy to murder RUC officers following a gun attack on a police station in west Belfast almost two years ago. He spends 23 hours a day locked in his cell as punishment for refusing to do prison work. The Northern Ireland Prison Service is adamant it will not allow Maghaberry to go the way the Maze went with paramilitary-controlled, segregated wings and IRA and loyalist prisoners running the jail in all but name. 'I am determined to go through with this protest, whether that means a dirty protest or eventually a hunger strike. I am a political prisoner, not a criminal,' he said echoing the anti-H-Block campaigns of the Seventies and Eighties. 'There will be four more Real IRA prisoners coming on to the sentenced section of this jail in a few months. We will hopefully co-operate on the campaign for political status, and together even seven of us can make this place ungovernable.' The Continuity IRA was formed after splits in Republican Sinn Fein in 1986.",

      "body": "<p>When 26-year-old Steven Flannigan is laid to rest in a pretty Lockerbie graveyard tomorrow afternoon, his remains will join those of his brother and sister. Had the bodies of his parents not been destroyed when Pan-Am 103 crashed into their terraced bungalow with the force of a meteorite on the night of 21 December 1988, his would be the last of five corpses in one grave. As it is, only two coffins had to be disturbed last week to make space for the last of the Flannigan clan.</p> <p>Steven is the final member of a family wiped out in brutal increments by a domino run of disasters that began the night a strange, whistling wind was first heard above Lockerbie that winter's evening. The body of his 10-year-old sister was eventually found in the 30-foot crater gouged out of Sherwood Crescent, but his parents, blasted into pieces too tiny to recover, were never found.</p> <p>Steven, 14, was lucky. He had braved the wet, windy night to take his sister's Christmas present - a new bicycle - to be checked over by a neighbour just minutes before the whining wind turned into a roll of thunder which grew louder and louder as the doomed airplane fell.</p> <p>That night, 270 people aged from 82 to two months were murdered, their torn bodies thrown by the vicious force of the bomb across the countryside for over five miles in all directions. Among the dead were 11 locals killed as they pottered around their houses, putting up Christmas decorations and looking forward to the festivities ahead.</p> <p>It has forever linked Lockerbie with tragedy in the public's mind and Steven came to symbolise the nightmare for everyone involved. Labelled the 'Orphan of Lockerbie', the quiet, unassuming child was left to rebuild his life without a single possession or memorial of his family for consolation.</p> <p>Steven did have one comfort: his 19-year-old brother, David, had also survived the crash. After an argument with his family some weeks before, David had been living with a friend in Blackpool. Kate, his mother, had rung her neighbour, Marjory McQueen, just the day before to tell her how the family had arranged a reconciliation and that David was coming home on Boxing Day. She could not have been more happy.</p> <p>But the reunion never took place and it was McQueen with whom David sat the next day, after a panicked, high-speed journey up the M6, desperately trying to take in the disaster that had devastated his life. 'Eventually he stumbled outside to the crater that had been his home,' McQueen remembers. 'He returned carrying this tiny, plastic watering can, the sort of thing you might buy for 50 pence at Woolworths. All fluorescent pinks and greens, and completely untouched. He bought it in and put it down carefully next to his chair. Then he said \"That's all that I can find of my family\". This stupid little thing had lain there untouched, while his family were literally bombed into oblivion in a blast so fierce that cast-iron fences streets away melted into puddles, and that was all that was left. It broke my heart.'</p> <p>But soon the boys did have something left to them. Reports differ and the precise amount was never verified but between them, the two young men were awarded around \u00a32.1 million in compensation. Steven sensibly invested his share, but David, who called it 'dirty money', spent his as quickly and destructively as he could.</p> <p>Five years and eight days later, David was dead. His new life of fast cars, drugs and drink had taken its toll and on 29 December 1993, he died from heart failure in a cheap hostel in Thailand.</p> <p>'It was awful when the news of David's death came seeping into the village. It just seemed so horribly unfair that anything more could happen to the remains of a family that had been through so much and to Steven in particular, who was trying so hard to make a new life for himself,' said McQueen, now a local councillor but still living in the same house, 200 yards from Sherwood Crescent, where she sheltered dozens of traumatised villagers that night while her doctor husband combed the nearby hills, checking shattered bodies for signs of life.</p> <p>Steven, who was still living with foster parents in Lockerbie, displayed astonishing strength. He chose the wild rock music for his brother's funeral and the gravestone epitaph: 'Lived to the Limit'. But how can one small boy survive such sustained violence at the hands of fate? A few months after burying his brother, the gentle, intense 19-year-old who had planned to become a fitter with British Gas, started an affair with his foster mother. When they were found making love by her distraught husband, it shattered his surrogate family and gave Steven the excuse he needed to flee the town which, for him, contained only ghosts.</p> <p>In a strange twist, Steven decided to become a jumbo jet pilot. He travelled to Florida, won his private licence and returned to Glasgow with a new friend, John Boyce, an ITN cameraman 15 years older than him who was to turn his life around. Neither man could suspect that, less than six years after their homecoming, John would be keeping watch at Steven's bedside as he lay dying.</p> <p>But for now, life was continuing apace and things were looking up. In 1996, he fell in love with 29-year-old Lisa Gregory during a visit back to Lockerbie and when she became pregnant, he moved back to live with her, just one mile away from the street where his life had been first been ripped apart a few years earlier.</p> <p>Before long, however, the relationship disintegrated. Some suggest that Steven had taken to denying his ghosts with the help of alcohol but friends reject this claim. Whatever happened, before Luke was born in October 1997, Steven had already seen his third opportunity to be part of a family trickle through his fingers and had escaped to Wiltshire, where Boyce and his wife welcomed him with open arms.</p> <p>Under Boyce's fatherly hand, the curse that had blighted Steven's attempts to shrug off the nightmares of the past began to lift.</p> <p>He was a devoted father who regularly visited his son and was on good terms with his ex-partner.</p> <p>In the charming village of Bradford on Avon, no one knew him as the 'Orphan of Lockerbie', nobody knew about his millions and nobody whispered about betrayed husbands.</p> <p>For the first time, Steven's attempts to create a new family succeeded. Perhaps because he had lost so many, the sincere, confident and sociable young man worked hard on the people he had left. Before long, the 25-year-old had built a circle of close friends on whom he relied and confided.</p> <p>When Boyce and his wife, Jo Shard, moved to Ashe Cottage in the hamlet of Heywood to start a guesthouse 18 months ago, Steven became a partner in the business and moved in with them, designing an extension for the ivy-covered cottage that included a room for his son.</p> <p>'Steve had recovered from two tragedies in his life,' Boyce said last week. 'The first one that he had to come to terms with was colossal but he and David coped with it by drawing immense strength from each other. David's death was the lowest point in Steve's life but he somehow managed to pull himself through that and then, over several years, forged a new life for himself with lots of new interests and a very large circle of friends.'</p> <p>But fate had not finished with the Orphan of Lockerbie yet. On Thursday 17 August, visitors staying at the guesthouse asked Steven to show them the local pub and he agreed, sitting with them in the cosy snug room until late and entertaining them with stories of his recent visit to Lockerbie - which he still referred to as 'home' - for his son's third birthday, and the barbecue he was planning for his own birthday the following weekend, which friends would combine with a final push on the extension in time for Luke's first visit in two weeks' time.</p> <p>'He was absolutely like he always was,' said Tony Elderkin, manager of the Royal Oak and a close friend of Steven. 'He'd bought me some haggis back from Scotland and after the visitors had gone, we sat together until almost 1am, watching the golf.</p> <p>'He was just learning to play and was hugely enthusiastic - he was due to play the next day and was careful not to drink too much because he didn't want to spoil his game.'</p> <p>At 12.50am, Elderkin saw Steven out of the pub. 'I said to him, \"I'll see you on Thursday if not before\" and he agreed. I watched him as he walked down the path and then went back inside. I never saw him again.'</p> <p>It is a mystery what was going through Steven's mind after Elderkin turned away. Some inevitably whisper that it was suicide, suggesting that the recent marriage of Gregory to another man had triggered despair which revived his dreadful past, but others who knew him well angrily reject this.</p> <p>Whatever the truth, the bare facts are clear: Steven headed back to the cottage using an unsigned route familiar to locals which cuts across the busy, twin-track Westbury-Trowbridge rail line. The banks of the line are loose gravel, piled three-feet high and pitted with deep potholes. He fell across the lines.</p> <p>It is for the coroner to decide how long Steven lay on the cold track but whether he sat by the line for nearly two hours beforehand confronting his nightmares or whether he slipped trying to cross the line and knocked himself unconscious is as yet unknown.</p> <p>What is known is that at around 3am, two drivers of a slow-moving maintenance train saw someone lying motionless in front of them on the track with their limbs chaotically splayed.</p> <p>It was too late to stop the train but its momentum was so slow that, despite being whisked to the Royal United Hospital in Bath within half an hour of the collision, it took Steven two days to die. Surrounded by 20 friends, he never regained consciousness and at 3pm on Sunday 20 August, the last victim of the Lockerbie tragedy eventually gave up his battle for life.</p> <p>'It's wretched, wretched. He had everything to live for,' said Martyn Wilmott, Steven's closest friend after Boyce and the man who was to play golf with him the day of his accident.</p> <p>'For three unnatural accidents to obliterate a family of five is almost too much. It's hard to believe life can do this to anyone. I find it very hard to bear.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore is finally on a roll. But where will it take him? This past week he's been telling Americans 'we've got to put you first' and not 'the ones with connections, the ones with wealth, the ones with power above and beyond what the average family has in this country'. He's for the people, while 'the other side' is for the powerful.</p> <p>It's good old-fashioned hell-fire-and-brimstone political rhetoric. During the Thirties, Franklin D. Roosevelt condemned the 'economic royalists' - America's big businesses that, he said, were stomping on average Americans. In 1912, progressive Republican Teddy Roosevelt blamed the 'malefactors of great wealth' for subjugating the 'little man' of America. In the 1890s, prairie populist William Jennings Bryan (who almost made it to the White House) railed at the bankers and other 'powerful interests' who were 'bankrupting' hard-working people.</p> <p>But this kind of talk hasn't been heard from a Democratic Presidential candidate since the dismal final week of Michael Dukakis's ill-fated 1988 Presidential run, when, with his candidacy sinking like a stone, Dukakis briefly and suddenly became an economic populist. By then, of course, it was too late.</p> <p>It hasn't been heard from Al Gore, either - until two weeks ago. Quite the contrary. In the 1988 Democratic primary, Gore ran as a business-friendly moderate. A few years later he helped launch the Democratic Leadership Council - a refuge for so-called 'new' Democrats who wanted nothing to do with pro-union, corporate-bashing old Democrats.</p> <p>In 1992, Gore teamed up with Bill Clinton on a brazenly New Democrat (forerunner of Tony Blair's Third Way) platform. Then, as Vice President, he urged Clinton to slash the budget deficit and go slow on new programmes for health care and education so that American corporations could enjoy lower interest rates. And he spurred Clinton into making free trade a top priority. Gore then led the fight for the North American Free Trade Act, followed by the agreement setting up the World Trade Organization. Business loved him for it. The unions were less than overjoyed.</p> <p>But in his acceptance speech at the Democratic convention Gore suddenly became a new Gore sounding like an old Democrat - telling Americans he sympathized with how 'so often powerful forces and powerful interests stand in your way and the odds seem stacked against you', and then naming the culprits: 'Big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs [Health Maintenance Organisations].'</p> <p>Gore fired up the delegates, and fired himself up as well. He pledged to 'fight' for 'working families' - a code term for 'the working-class', which he reiterated nine times - and vowed to take on the big guys. 'Sometimes you have to be willing to stand up and say no, so families can have a better life.'</p> <p>And he has kept at it since then. Will he hammer the theme all the way through the crucial presidential debates - three of them tentatively scheduled for October - and on to election day, 7 November?</p> <p>It's a calculated risk. Undoubtedly Gore got a 'bounce' from his performance at the Democratic convention. Polls now put him slightly ahead of George W. Bush. Before the convention, he was trailing by about 15 points. The new rhetoric also seems to make Gore a more passionate campaigner - a quality he desperately needs. Otherwise, he's stiff and technocratic, especially in contrast to George W. Bush's glib geniality.</p> <p>The 'people versus the powerful' theme exactly points up the distinction Gore wants to highlight between him and George W. It's the Republicans' biggest vulnerability - the public's lingering worry that Republicans only care about the privileged. That's why Bush has been pushing his 'compassionate' conservatism, and talking non-stop about education.</p> <p>But George W. Bush can't hide the facts: After all, congressional Republicans have blocked popular legislation aimed at tobacco, environmental pollution, pharmaceutical companies, and HMOs. Their recent tax cuts have all been sops to America's wealthiest. And - most important - Bush's own plan for a massive tax cut would overwhelmingly benefit richer Americans. The people versus the powerful, indeed.</p> <p>Gore's rhetoric could also fire up the Democratic 'base' - unionized workers, teachers, and public employees. Gore needs to energize them for the election. Not only do they have to be motivated to vote, but also to run the phone-banks and drive the vans that will get other Democrats to the polls on election day.</p> <p>Until now, the base been only luke-warm toward Gore. Some (especially in all-important California) have even toyed with the idea of voting instead for left-wing Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.</p> <p>But Gore's new strategy also poses substantial risks.</p> <p>It's hard to tell Americans they're powerless and vulnerable while at the same time telling them they've never had it so good. The two messages directly conflict. Yet surely Gore's biggest selling point is he's been second-in-command in an administration that presided over eight years of extraordinary economic growth. Unemployment and inflation are now lower than they've been in 30 years, median wages are rising, and even Americans at the lowest rungs of the economic ladder are starting to make progress. 'Are you better now than you were eight years ago, when they were in office?' is a more persuasive rhetorical question than 'do you feel like you're being screwed by them and their powerful friends?' But Gore can't very well expect people to say yes to both.</p> <p>In fact, most voting Americans don't like to think of themselves as powerless, and they don't much like class warfare because they hope to hit the jackpot one day and become rich. Populist rhetoric may fire up the Democratic 'base' but it's tended to be a loser with America's large and upwardly-mobile middle class.</p> <p>Meanwhile, poor and working-class Americans who have more reason to feel powerless have all but stopped voting. In 1996, less than half of adult Americans eligible to vote actually walked into voting booths, and most of those who didn't were in the bottom half of the income ladder. This is precisely why in recent years, Democratic politicians - including Bill Clinton and Al Gore in 1992 and, especially, in 1996 - have pitched their campaigns to the upscale suburbs, and why Democrats have tended to drift to the right, where suburban 'swing' voters are found. Will the new rhetoric attract back some of America's non-voters?</p> <p>Gore's new tack also risks reopening the question - already asked by Bush at almost every campaign stop - of who Gore really is and what he really believes. Gore's speeches may be full of specifics about education, health care, and Social Security, but it's not clear what they add up to. Is he a New Democrat? An old Democrat? A born-again Populist?</p> <p>As noted, the new theme seems to have nothing to do with Gore's history. It's even at odds with his chosen running mate, Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who's voting record is to the right of most Democrats. Lieberman is also pro-business, he's the current head of the Democratic Leadership Council, and he's one of the Senate's largest benefactors of contributions from the insurance and health-care industries.</p> <p>It's not clear whether Gore's post-convention 'bounce' has had anything to do with his new old-Democrat theme, anyway. Polls show he gained only 2 percentage points among men, statistically insignificant. But he gained 16 per cent of women. And it's a fair bet that what women liked most - in addition to Gore's obviously genuine affection for his wife (America is still talking about the prolonged kiss he gave Tipper after her introduction of him, probably the most notorious Public Display of Affection in American political history) - was his unbridled support for abortion rights and for equal pay for women. (Bush and the Republicans are negative on both.) Women didn't flock to Gore because of his new-found populism.</p> <p>But not to worry. There's plenty of time between now and the debates for Gore to measure the benefits of his new message against its potential risks, and make whatever adjustments seem necessary. And you can be sure he will. No modern American politician thinks more carefully before he acts than Albert Gore, Jr.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Greg Dyke aims to kick the bureaucrats out of the BBC and put programme-makers back in the hot seat of public service broadcasting.</p>",
      "byline": "Melvyn Bragg",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In Edinburgh on Friday evening, in the twenty-fifth McTaggart Lecture at the Television Festival, Greg Dyke staked his claim - or at least his ambition - to be a Director General on a par with John Reith, who set the BBC in motion in the first half of the twentieth century, and Hugh Carlton-Greene, who rejuvenated it for the second half. </p> <p>His lecture was a battle-plan aimed to carry the BBC deep into the twenty-first century. If his strategy succeeds then he will have reinvented the BBC for a world that is infinitely more complex and ruthless than Reith or Greene could ever have dreamt up. </p> <p>It seems to me that he has come just in time and with the right balance of idealism and hard-headed broadcasting nous. Without his energy and boldness, I believe the BBC would have mouldered along sadly, accepting decline, pottering into a self-embalming bureaucracy like many another empire, merely surviving at all costs to the end of its day. Dyke has not only given it a reprieve, he has re-directed the way in which it can release its unique broadcasting and cultural force - by putting programmes not just at the centre of its purpose, but by declaring they are the meaning of its existence. </p> <p>His basic text was change. Other themes were plaited around it but, again and again, he returned to the need for radical, urgent change, all the while acknowledging that it is a notion to which the British at the moment seem to have an almost pathological allergy. </p> <p>One of the ways he tackled this was to look at two of his predecessors, Reith and Greene. Greene, clearly Dyke's hero in the history of the BBC, turned around an institution which was being hammered by the then new upstart, ITV. In that two-channel world the BBC's share had fallen from 100 per cent to 34 per cent by 1960 and showed no signs of rising. Everyone understood that this threatened the licence fee. Greene set about saving it. </p> <p>He reorganised news and current affairs. He enabled a raft of programmes to be made - popular quality programmes such as Play For Today, Z-Cars, That Was The Week That Was, Till Death Us Do Part, Steptoe &amp; Son. He claimed a new channel, BBC 2, and got the right to innovate technologically with colour television and 625 lines. He met the threat of pirate radio by putting in place Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. </p> <p>And what did Reith say of this saviour of the BBC? 'I led, he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age. I am very annoyed I even got on terms with him.' Mary Whitehouse said: 'If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carlton-Greene.' </p> <p>Dyke acknowledges that Greene built on the work of Ian Jacob, just as he acknowledges that he is building on the work of John Birt, though undoubtedly overturning much that was put in place by his predecessor. </p> <p>Criticism of change has gone on. Matthew Bannister was hammered for reshaping Radio 1, Liz Forgan for setting up 5 Live, John Birt for setting up BBC Online. And were these new services to be stripped away then there would undoubtedly be a colossal campaign opposing this, led by the same sad old ex-BBC captains who have become a glum club of complaint in the land. </p> <p>In proposing change there were arguments which were familiar but none the less important for that. Digital television has been a spectre at the TV feast for years. Now it's at the table.

      "bodyText": "In Edinburgh on Friday evening, in the twenty-fifth McTaggart Lecture at the Television Festival, Greg Dyke staked his claim - or at least his ambition - to be a Director General on a par with John Reith, who set the BBC in motion in the first half of the twentieth century, and Hugh Carlton-Greene, who rejuvenated it for the second half. His lecture was a battle-plan aimed to carry the BBC deep into the twenty-first century. If his strategy succeeds then he will have reinvented the BBC for a world that is infinitely more complex and ruthless than Reith or Greene could ever have dreamt up. It seems to me that he has come just in time and with the right balance of idealism and hard-headed broadcasting nous. Without his energy and boldness, I believe the BBC would have mouldered along sadly, accepting decline, pottering into a self-embalming bureaucracy like many another empire, merely surviving at all costs to the end of its day. Dyke has not only given it a reprieve, he has re-directed the way in which it can release its unique broadcasting and cultural force - by putting programmes not just at the centre of its purpose, but by declaring they are the meaning of its existence. His basic text was change. Other themes were plaited around it but, again and again, he returned to the need for radical, urgent change, all the while acknowledging that it is a notion to which the British at the moment seem to have an almost pathological allergy. One of the ways he tackled this was to look at two of his predecessors, Reith and Greene. Greene, clearly Dyke's hero in the history of the BBC, turned around an institution which was being hammered by the then new upstart, ITV. In that two-channel world the BBC's share had fallen from 100 per cent to 34 per cent by 1960 and showed no signs of rising. Everyone understood that this threatened the licence fee. Greene set about saving it. He reorganised news and current affairs. He enabled a raft of programmes to be made - popular quality programmes such as Play For Today, Z-Cars, That Was The Week That Was, Till Death Us Do Part, Steptoe &amp; Son. He claimed a new channel, BBC 2, and got the right to innovate technologically with colour television and 625 lines. He met the threat of pirate radio by putting in place Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4. And what did Reith say of this saviour of the BBC? 'I led, he follows the crowd in all the disgusting manifestations of the age. I am very annoyed I even got on terms with him.' Mary Whitehouse said: 'If you were to ask me who, above all, was responsible for the moral collapse which characterised the Sixties and Seventies I would unhesitatingly name Sir Hugh Carlton-Greene.' Dyke acknowledges that Greene built on the work of Ian Jacob, just as he acknowledges that he is building on the work of John Birt, though undoubtedly overturning much that was put in place by his predecessor. Criticism of change has gone on. Matthew Bannister was hammered for reshaping Radio 1, Liz Forgan for setting up 5 Live, John Birt for setting up BBC Online. And were these new services to be stripped away then there would undoubtedly be a colossal campaign opposing this, led by the same sad old ex-BBC captains who have become a glum club of complaint in the land. In proposing change there were arguments which were familiar but none the less important for that. Digital television has been a spectre at the TV feast for years. Now it's at the table. Digital satellite homes take in 160 channels and when the TIVO box arrives, viewers will have total freedom to watch what they want when they want. In digital homes, the Nine O'Clock News is watched by fewer than 10 per cent of the audience - which is one of the reasons Dyke intends to move it to 10pm, where research indicates that there is a greater available number of viewers. Dyke's plan is three-pronged - money, channels and public service.

By cutting that to 15 per cent in three years, and further after that, whole departments of programme-making can be refurbished.

      "body": "<p>'Everyone has a right to life; so why should we kill one our daughters to enable the other to survive.' This was part of the submission in which the parents of Jodie and Mary, the Siamese twins, refused permission for them to be separated, thus condemning both of them to an early death.</p> <p>The claim that everyone has a right to life is not unfamiliar. It was, for example, the basis on which the parents of the notorious child B founded their attack on the local heath authority who refused to pay for further surgery on a child whom they though unable to survive it. The assertion of a right is always more persuasive when it is made on behalf of someone unable to speak for themselves. But there is no law entitling a foetus to life at the expense of her mother, nor entitling a new-born baby to life at the expense of her conjoined sister. So the right evoked must be a moral not a legal right, claimed under a moral principle, not a legal instrument. The complexity of this case is precisely to formulate the moral principle involved.</p> <p>The parents, Roman Catholics, invoke God's will and they will probably argue that it is God's will that everyone equally has a right to life. All are equally God's children, so equality of treatment on the twins is the paramount moral imperative. After all, they, and God love them equally; and so both must die.</p> <p>The doctors involved in the case, and the judge, regarded the saving of one life, which, given skilled surgery will probably be normal and relatively problem free has a more moral significance than the saving of the other life which could never be other than brief and totally dependent on her sister to support it. Without heart or lungs, the baby Mary could hardly be though of as a separate human being, and her dependence on her sister would ultimately destroy that potentially normal life. So the judge, and probably the majority of the medical profession, came down on the side of separation, and the immediate destruction of the life of Mary. They saw it as the saving of a life which would otherwise have been lost.</p> <p>Is this a decision with which we, as a society, should be satisfied? I believe that it is. But there is one aspect of it which is of great importance. Broadly, it is a decision of a secular society, unwilling to take seriously the religious scruples of the parents. This is a factor in the case which we cannot disregard, and which, I believe, should be examined more closely. For it is too readily assumed that the religious and the secular cannot communicate that they will always be on opposite sides in issues of life and death. Those who believe, for example, in the immortal souls of Mary and Jodie, which have been in God's hands and will be in God's hands for all eternity, are more indifferent to death than those who think that the saving of a life is of paramount importance. There is a parallel here with the case of Jehovahs Witnesses who used to be able to refuse, on doctrinal grounds, blood transfusions for their children whose lives depended on the procedure. It now seems that they have relaxed their principles, recognising perhaps that there is a consensus against them.</p> <p>The fact, I think, is that the religious and the secular are not necessarily so deeply at odds with one another as one perceived. There are those who, without repudiating religion, are capable of taking a developmental or biological view of human life. According to this view Mary's life would hardly be regarded as the life of a human being, let alone one with an immortal soul. It would more plausibly be regarded as an assemblage of human tissues that would never result in a human person, and the removal of which from Jodie could be regarded as analogous to the removal of a tumour, an unwanted and destructive growth of cells, which are undoubtedly human cells, and alive, but are nevertheless not and never will be a human being. Religion will eventually adapt itself to this view of human life, just as, in the past, it adapted itself to the Copernican Revolution, and the principles of Newtonian physics. It will so adapt because the human need for religion will not go away. But neither will the human desire to understand and manage the universe around it.</p> <p>There still remains, however, the issue of the extent to which the combined forces of medicine and the law are entitled to overrule the moral and religion convictions of the parents of a child. (I leave on one side the particular situation of these parents and these children, who were immigrants from a foreign country, and subject to the laws of this country only in as far as they had taken up temporary residence here, for their children to have the best chance of being born alive).</p> <p>There are two issues here: the faith that we place in the knowledge and experience of doctors, and the degree to which we believe that the law based on a moral consensus from which particular and personal moral principles may not divert. As for the first, it seems to me to be a recipe for disaster if our faith in medical knowledge and experience is so eroded that we can never say that 'the doctor knows best'. It is generally bad news for the patient if his treatment has to depend as much on his own choice as on the superior knowledge of his doctor. The medical profession has become so fearful of litigation that it sometimes incapable of giving advice on purely professional matters on which the patient ('or customer') can have no informed views. Judges, mercifully, remain more dictatorial, more ready to fulfil their function which is to give a judicial decision, whether or not it is in accord with what the lay person who appears before them may want. But judges (and I believe doctors as well) are not outside the scope of morality. They may not share the private moral views of those whose cases they are considering (in this case the religious scruples of the parents of the twins).</p> <p>But it is their duty to take into account the general and public morality of the society they serve. They must also take into account the peculiarly fraught circumstances of the people whose case they are considering. Everyone who has ever had a baby knows the state of acute emotional sensitivity that follows a birth. One cannot see even a kitten or a puppy, let alone a human baby, without feeling near tears of sympathy with this new life. How could it be possible for the mother of Mary and Jodie, far more than normally traumatised to make a sensible long term decision about her daughter, only 18 days after their birth? Morality undoubtedly depends as much on feeling as on reason. Yet, in the realm of public morality it is necessary to weigh reason against sentiment, and to see how precedent and general policy will be affected by a particular and emotionally charged decision. I believe that Mr Justice Johnston was right and I hope that the Official Solicitor, representing those who cannot speak for themselves, will not appeal against his judgement. And later, if all goes well can we really suppose that Jodie the surviving daughter will not be loved and cherished by her parents, as the happy outcome of God's will?</p> <p>\u0095 Lady Mary Warnock is a crossbench life peer, moral philosopher and author of the Intelligent Person's Guide to Morals</p>",

      "body": "<p>Although I am very happy to be back in Britain after three years, I have hardly been rejoicing. Failing intervention by the Attorney-General, I expect to appear in court soon facing possible imprisonment for breaching the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>But the real criminals in this affair are the British Government and the intelligence services. The Government has a duty to uphold the law. It cannot simply be ignored because crimes are carried out by friends of the Government.</p> <p>In November 1999, I sent the Home Secretary Jack Straw detailed evidence of involvement by MI6 officers in a plot to murder Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Although the assassination failed when attempted in 1996, innocent Libyan civilians were killed.</p> <p>In a dossier I presented to Mr Straw, I included the names of those who had also been briefed about the plot within MI5. Mr Straw merely indicated to journalists in off-the-record briefings that he was 'looking into the matter'. Robin Cook labelled my evidence 'pure fantasy', an assertion now contradicted by an MI6 report posted on the Internet last February.</p> <p>When presented with this compelling evidence these very senior Ministers should, of course, have called in the police immediately. We would never countenance two police officers conspiring to murder a criminal. Why should we accept that two MI6 officers could do the same to Colonel Gaddafi?</p> <p>This week, I will be writing to both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service asking them to investigate the role of the Government in this case. As part of any inquiry, Special Branch would have to have unfettered access to Government discussions about my case. Should the Government frustrate this process, it would lay itself open to accusations of either obstructing or perverting the course of justice. And what has Sir Stephen Lander, now head of MI5, done to protect the reputation of the organisation he runs?</p> <p>When I joined MI5, I was told it obeyed the law and always had the utmost respect for civil liberties. So inevitably I am left wondering why Sir Stephen did not perform his clear public duty and call in Special Branch to investigate the Gadaffi plot as soon as he realised that MI6 did not have Ministerial authorisation to plot to assassinate a foreign head of state. In August 1998, I also pointed out publicly that MI5 had evidence of the plot on its file SF754-0168.</p> <p>Sir Stephen is, sadly, a man who keeps quiet about crimes committed by MI6 but stands by while a properly-motivated whistleblower is persecuted. I fear he has already connived in misleading the Government over MI5's failure to prevent an IRA attack on the British mainland in 1993, a matter I will seek to have disclosed at my forthcoming trial.</p> <p>The Government's failure to ensure that two MI6 officers are brought to justice for their part in planning a murder is what I would expect of despots and dictators. It is not only an abuse of power. It is an insult to those who respect the rule of law, including the vast majority of the British public.</p> <p>It is corruption. It is sleaze. And sleaze was where New Labour came in as a supposed breath of fresh air after the Conservatives had grown corrupt.</p> <p>The Attorney General's office is still determined to prosecute the editor of Punch magazine early next month for claiming that institutional failures in the intelligence services failed to prevent the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1993. That was the biggest terrorist attack on the British mainland in history.</p> <p>This all contrasts remarkably with the attitude taken towards former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson. After alleging impropriety in the intelligence services to the Sunday Times in 1996, he was the beneficiary of an immunity deal which saw him receiving a substantial sum of taxpayers' money and help in finding a new job in return for future silence.</p> <p>This tragic episode is fast becoming British Watergate. Until Nixon was exposed, the American public was generally prepared to tolerate some secrecy surrounding the work of government because they trusted their elected representatives. But our Ministers should not forget that once their president had been impeached, Americans were no longer prepared to take that government on trust. As a consequence, the American people have now won the most liberal freedom of information policy in the world. Dumb commentators still suggest glibly that 'secrets must remain secret'. That argument is an affront to the public's right to know how our intelligence services operate on their behalf. Secrecy and the ludicrous legislation which props it up is inimical to freedom of expression.</p> <p>These naive commentators do not have the wit or intelligence to realise that they undermine the proper ability of the press to hold the most secretive and unaccountable areas of government up to public scrutiny. If people want to live in a country where the intelligence services work in absolute secrecy with no respect for the rule of law or basic human rights, they should go and live in Libya, Iraq or Iran.</p> <p>As the head of Britain's intelligence services, Tony Blair now has a simple - and honourable - choice. To expose the truth. My message to the servants of the state remains simple. Don't shoot the messenger. Don't let MI6 get away with murder.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/shayler\">Special report: David Shayler</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/freedom\">Special report: freedom of information</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.mi5.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">MI5</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmbills/005/2000005.htm\" target=\"_new\">Freedom of information bill</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Although I am very happy to be back in Britain after three years, I have hardly been rejoicing. Failing intervention by the Attorney-General, I expect to appear in court soon facing possible imprisonment for breaching the Official Secrets Act. But the real criminals in this affair are the British Government and the intelligence services. The Government has a duty to uphold the law. It cannot simply be ignored because crimes are carried out by friends of the Government. In November 1999, I sent the Home Secretary Jack Straw detailed evidence of involvement by MI6 officers in a plot to murder Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi. Although the assassination failed when attempted in 1996, innocent Libyan civilians were killed. In a dossier I presented to Mr Straw, I included the names of those who had also been briefed about the plot within MI5. Mr Straw merely indicated to journalists in off-the-record briefings that he was 'looking into the matter'. Robin Cook labelled my evidence 'pure fantasy', an assertion now contradicted by an MI6 report posted on the Internet last February. When presented with this compelling evidence these very senior Ministers should, of course, have called in the police immediately. We would never countenance two police officers conspiring to murder a criminal. Why should we accept that two MI6 officers could do the same to Colonel Gaddafi? This week, I will be writing to both the police and the Crown Prosecution Service asking them to investigate the role of the Government in this case. As part of any inquiry, Special Branch would have to have unfettered access to Government discussions about my case. Should the Government frustrate this process, it would lay itself open to accusations of either obstructing or perverting the course of justice. And what has Sir Stephen Lander, now head of MI5, done to protect the reputation of the organisation he runs? When I joined MI5, I was told it obeyed the law and always had the utmost respect for civil liberties. So inevitably I am left wondering why Sir Stephen did not perform his clear public duty and call in Special Branch to investigate the Gadaffi plot as soon as he realised that MI6 did not have Ministerial authorisation to plot to assassinate a foreign head of state. In August 1998, I also pointed out publicly that MI5 had evidence of the plot on its file SF754-0168. Sir Stephen is, sadly, a man who keeps quiet about crimes committed by MI6 but stands by while a properly-motivated whistleblower is persecuted. I fear he has already connived in misleading the Government over MI5's failure to prevent an IRA attack on the British mainland in 1993, a matter I will seek to have disclosed at my forthcoming trial. The Government's failure to ensure that two MI6 officers are brought to justice for their part in planning a murder is what I would expect of despots and dictators. It is not only an abuse of power. It is an insult to those who respect the rule of law, including the vast majority of the British public. It is corruption. It is sleaze. And sleaze was where New Labour came in as a supposed breath of fresh air after the Conservatives had grown corrupt. The Attorney General's office is still determined to prosecute the editor of Punch magazine early next month for claiming that institutional failures in the intelligence services failed to prevent the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1993. That was the biggest terrorist attack on the British mainland in history. This all contrasts remarkably with the attitude taken towards former MI6 officer Richard Tomlinson. After alleging impropriety in the intelligence services to the Sunday Times in 1996, he was the beneficiary of an immunity deal which saw him receiving a substantial sum of taxpayers' money and help in finding a new job in return for future silence. This tragic episode is fast becoming British Watergate. Until Nixon was exposed, the American public was generally prepared to tolerate some secrecy surrounding the work of government because they trusted their elected representatives. But our Ministers should not forget that once their president had been impeached, Americans were no longer prepared to take that government on trust. As a consequence, the American people have now won the most liberal freedom of information policy in the world. Dumb commentators still suggest glibly that 'secrets must remain secret'. That argument is an affront to the public's right to know how our intelligence services operate on their behalf. Secrecy and the ludicrous legislation which props it up is inimical to freedom of expression. These naive commentators do not have the wit or intelligence to realise that they undermine the proper ability of the press to hold the most secretive and unaccountable areas of government up to public scrutiny. If people want to live in a country where the intelligence services work in absolute secrecy with no respect for the rule of law or basic human rights, they should go and live in Libya, Iraq or Iran. As the head of Britain's intelligence services, Tony Blair now has a simple - and honourable - choice. To expose the truth. My message to the servants of the state remains simple. Don't shoot the messenger. Don't let MI6 get away with murder. Useful links Special report: David Shayler Special report: freedom of information MI5 Freedom of information bill",

      "body": "<p>Hurricane Debby had passed and the moon was fading into the glow of dawn. Richard Branson was half-asleep under a billiard table at his home on Necker, his Caribbean island. Above him on the table lay Australian pop star Natalie Imbruglia. </p> <p>Branson, his family, and around 20 guests had left their beachside bedrooms early Tuesday night and huddled in the sitting room to escape the 100mph winds. It was a rough night. Branson was dozing when one of his staff tapped him on the shoulder. 'It's 4am, boss.' He tied a towel around his waist and picked his way past sleeping bodies to his office. </p> <p>Four thousand miles away in London's West End, Dame Helena Shovelton, chair of the Lottery Commission, was proof-reading the press release announcing who had won the bitter contest to run the lottery from 2001. The telephone rang. 'Hello Dame Helena. It's Richard Branson. The hurricane's blown over but I am still on Caribbean time. I said I would call you to see where we were.' </p> <p>Branson was feeling groggy. The night before he had celebrated his daughter Holly's A-level results which were good enough to get her into medicine at London University. Shovelton began reading the statement in front of her. </p> <p>'The People's Lottery Bid to run the National Lottery has been refused for a number of specific reasons including a funding shortfall of an estimated \u00a350 million.' Branson slumped into his chair. She went on. 'Camelot's bid to run the lottery has also been refused. We are prepared to enter into sole negotiations with the People's Lottery to try to resolve the specific outstanding issues over the next four weeks.' </p> <p>Branson grinned. 'Are you still there?' Shovelton asked. 'Did you get all of that?' 'Yes. Thank you. I'll be in London by tomorrow morning,' Branson said before hanging up. As he turned to go back to bed he saw his daughter standing in the doorway. The call had woken her and she had overheard the conversation. 'How much does the lottery cost?' she asked. 'About \u00a350m of my money,' Branson thought as they went to their makeshift beds, exhausted and elated. That dawn call marked the end of a long wait. Seven years since Branson lost his first bid to run the lottery, the 'comeback kid' had his prize. It would cost him a large chunk of his fortune but his numbers had finally come up. </p> <p>As Branson fell asleep another storm, far more potent than Hurricane Debby, was blowing up in London. John Jackson, the deputy chairman of The People's Lottery, and Simon Burridge, its chief executive, had been summoned to the commission's Monk Street Headquarters in Westminster to hear the details from Shovelton. They had not had a chance to speak to Branson and for a few moments the pair, who were both part of Branson's UK Lotteries Ltd consortium which bid for the original licence in 1993, were overwhelmed by d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. </p> <p>'At first we thought \"Oh dear, we're never going to get it\". Our chins hit our knees,' Jackson said. But as they read the text of the report it became clear just how close they were to running one of the world's biggest lotteries. They walked out confident they could meet the demand for a further \u00a350 million to act as a safety net to protect prizewinners. </p> <p>Jackson telephoned Branson that afternoon and realised that the Virgin boss had exorcised a personal demon. Branson has described the day his first lottery bid was rejected as 'the worst of my life'. When he flew into London on Thursday he declared that the commission's findings meant his life had 'been worth living. It is worthwhile being born'. </p> <p>Losing the first lottery licence was one of few black marks in a remarkable career. Having come fourth last time round, Branson, the people's champion, the cartel-buster, the man who made his name and his portfolio of 200 companies by taking on the big boys, was fixated with winning. </p> <p>If his lottery bid is successful, it will confirm Virgin as the brand that reaches everywhere. These days you can 'live a Virgin life'. </p> <p>Every morning you can wake up to Virgin radio, put on Virgin clothes and make-up, drive to work in a car bought through Virgin using money from your Virgin bank account. On your way home you can pop into a Virgin Active gym before sipping Virgin cola in the bar. At weekends you can use a Virgin mobile phone or Virgin's internet service to find out what is on at the local Virgin cinema. As you head off on holiday on a Virgin train or plane, you can play Virgin video games stopping only to buy your Virgin vodka in duty free. If you meet someone on the beach and one thing leads to another, the Virgin condoms are in the Virgin hotel minibar. When love blossoms, you get married with Virgin Brides and buy your first house with a Virgin mortgage and get a joint Virgin pension. </p> <p>The lottery provides a classic opportunity for Branson's unique, iconoclastic way of doing things. Robert Jones, a director of Wolff Olins, the branding consultancy, says: 'Branson's success comes from questioning institutions and big businesses, styling himself as the consumers' champion and fighting against rip-offs, bad service and complacency. After the bribery libel action with GTech's former boss [Guy Snowden] and claims that Camelot directors were fat cats, the lottery was a prime target. It had to be him.' </p> <p>Rita Clifton, head of the world's biggest branding firm, Interbrand, says: 'Branson stands for fun. His public image is laid back. The lottery is about fun and it was too good an opportunity to miss.' </p> <p>After his first failure, Branson was not taking chances. He built a much stronger consortium, bringing in partners like AWI, the US gaming experts, advertising agency J Walter Thompson and Microsoft. But something else had changed, too. The Branson consortium had decided to court New Labour. </p> <p>Before coming to power the party stressed a commitment to a non-profit lottery, something Branson had lobbied for for over several years. Branson's consortium - even its name has New Labour overtones - couldn't hide the fact that it was going have to pay suppliers like AWI, so it couldn't claim it was a not-for-profit lottery. But it did a good job of wearing a hair-shirt in public. </p> <p>The People's Lottery Consortium will not pay dividends to shareholders as Camelot has. 'We will make profits but our profits go to good causes,' Jackson says. </p> <p>Branson's ability to tap into New Labour's concerns about Camelot had been an evolutionary process. Once seen as the epitome of a Thatcherite entrepreneur, Branson viciously attacked the Tories after he lost the bid to run the first lottery. 'Of all the decisions I have ever seen any government make over many years, this is perhaps the most crass,' he declared. </p> <p>Throughout New Labour's political transformation during the Nineties, Branson kept the heat on Camelot, with a David and Goliath line. 'Camelot has a licence to print tickets and another to print money. It is another private monopoly set up by a Conservative government and making excessive profits,' Branson said in 1995. </p> <p>The same year, Branson attended the Labour conference and detailed his blueprint for a new lottery. He urged Tony Blair to scrap the way lottery consortium members received millions in dividends and instead to plough proceeds into healthcare and education. </p> <p>Branson tapped into public concern that many projects funded by the National Lottery - especially Millennium celebrations - did little for ordinary people. Better to spend on deserving causes, he argued. And all the time Camelot held the licence, the multi-millionaire Branson made a very public point of never buying a lottery ticket. </p> <p>His ability to read the moods of both the public and the Government had a dramatic effect once he launched a bid. For months it had looked like Camelot was the only player in town. A deal to put lottery terminals in post offices seemed to sound the death knell for any other bidder. Camelot was simply too strong. </p> <p>But once Branson had bid, all bets were off. Stung by accusations of corporate greed, Camelot was forced to slash its directors' pay and bonus packets. Dianne Thompson, Camelot's new chief executive, saw her total potential salary including bonuses slashed to \u00a3330,000, more than a third less than her predecessor. Dividends to consortium members would also be slashed in half, Camelot promised. </p> <p>Branson attacked Camelot head-on with Virgin razzamatazz. Camelot promised to make \u00a315 billion. The People's Lottery said it would make more. Branson's team pointed out how Camelot's ticket sales were tailing off. Camelot's scratchcard sales came in for special criticism. Once they were bringing in \u00a31.5bn a year. Now they make \u00a3500 million. </p> <p>The People's Lottery insisted it could reverse the slide by using 53 balls instead of Camelot's 49 - and allowing punters a one in three million chance of winning \u00a31m, rather than the one in 14 million currently on offer. </p> <p>As the champagne corks popped at Branson's Holland Park HQ on Wednesday, an emotional Thompson was being driven back to Camelot's Watford HQ. She was too stunned to speak. Camelot had decided against booking a venue for a celebration - partly to avoid accusations of triumphalism. Thompson and her team were confident, however, that they would be quietly celebrating. </p> <p>The signs were good. Newspapers said the commission would rule in Camelot's favour. Camelot's army of regulatory personnel, who deal with the National Lottery Commission weekly, had met the commission the previous Wednesday. There was no hint they were about to lose a \u00a315bn game. </p> <p>Camelot executives were worried that the commission's decision to push back the announcement of the winner from June to August might be linked to revelations made by a former GTech employee that the company had covered up a software fault that had meant some players had lost cash prizes. But the commission said the delay was 'merely a matter of logistics'. </p> <p>Nothing could have been more wrong. The commission's 'Statement of Reasons' explaining why Camelot was rejected proves that doubts about GTech's working practices were crucial. 'The commission remains extremely concerned about the behaviour of GTech,' the lottery watchdog said. 'The decision [to hide software problems] was taken against written advice from the general manager of GTech UK that Camelot and Oflot should be told.' </p> <p>On the M1 back to Watford, tears welled up in Thompson's eyes. Arriving at Camelot's HQ, she struggled to compose herself before breaking the news to Camelot's 800 staff. </p> <p>Throughout Wednesday afternoon, senior Camelot members talked to tearful employees. Regional offices were briefed via video conference. Nobody could understand why Branson's consortium had been given a month to modify its bid while theirs had been rejected outright. </p> <p>Camelot's lawyers suggested they appeal in court. It was decided Thompson should go back to London to launch a fightback. A statement was cobbled together. Outside Camelot's plush London HQ off Trafalgar Square, Thompson talked of the consortium's dismay. Having vented her spleen, she sped back to Watford. By half past six she was drinking lager with her staff in a Yates Brothers Wine Lodge in the centre of the town. The contrast with the champagne party at Holland Park could not have been more stark. </p> <p>Thompson didn't tell staff about the impending legal action and left after a couple of hours. She spent Thursday putting the plan into action. On Friday at the High Court, Mr Justice Sullivan ruled that discussions between the commission and The People's Lottery be suspended over the bank holiday weekend until a decision on whether to grant Camelot judicial review is reached. </p> <p>Branson, who contemplated a similar legal move when he lost the lottery back in 1994, said Camelot's decision would damage the lottery's reputation. </p> <p>Perhaps he should have said destroy the lottery's reputation. The chaos surrounding the commission's ruling has left the people's game with a battered public image. </p> <p>Branson believes he can repair it. The epitaphs won't read kindly if he fails. </p> <p> <strong>How the lottery fight unfolded</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1998 </strong></p> <p><strong> July </strong> GTech executives discover phantom ticket fault but opt to cover up the problems. </p> <p><strong> September</strong> Branson suggests failure of his original bid due to failing to donate money to Tories. Coincides with release of memoirs. </p> <p><strong>1999 </strong></p> <p><strong>May</strong> Camelot lobbies for 10-year second term, Branson indicates no interest in bidding. </p> <p><strong> June </strong> Camelot reports lottery sales down by \u00a3300m on previous year. </p> <p><strong> July</strong> Branson begins work on second bid, issues research showing public is 40 per cent more likely to play a lottery with all profits going to good causes. </p> <p><strong> November</strong> Branson, still undecided, lobbies government to even the playing field for new bidders. </p> <p><strong> December </strong> Lottery Commission says Camelot must replace old terminals if it wins, levelling the playing field. </p> <p><strong> 14 December</strong> Branson launches The People's</p> <p><strong> 2000 </strong></p> <p><strong> February</strong> Bids submitted, People's Lottery talks about making a millionaire a day. </p> <p><strong> 26 May</strong> David Armitage, a former GTech employee, reveals the software glitch that led to the phantom tickets. </p> <p><strong> 23 June </strong> Decision to grant lottery licence put back to August by commission after both bids fail to meet required standards. </p> <p><strong> 6 July </strong> William O'Connor, GTech chief executive, leaves company in wake of phantom ticket cover-up. </p> <p><strong> 23 August</strong> Commission announces that no winner has been chosen, but exclusive negotiations will continue with Branson's consortium. </p> <p>Camelot ruled out because of the GTech cover-up. </p> <p><strong> 25 August </strong> Camelot seeks judicial review of commission decision. </p> <p> <strong>Branson stakes all on GTech rival</strong></p> <p> Last time around, experts said one of the main reasons Richard Branson's UK Lotteries Ltd managed to come only fourth in the bidding process was because many doubted it would have the technological knowhow to deliver on its pledges. </p> <p>This time, however, Branson teamed up with Automated Wagering International (AWI), a subsidiary of Nevada-based casino company Anchor Gaming and arch- rival of GTech. </p> <p>Wednesday's news that Branson looked likely to win the lottery licence was good news for Anchor's share price. AWI is heavily reliant on two US state lottery contracts - Florida and Pennsylvania - and is keen to develop its operations further afield. This is largely because GTech dominates the US market. AWI runs 16 per cent of all the lottery terminals in the US, compared with GTech's 79 per cent. So far, though, AWI has won only four international lottery contracts - in Chile, China, Norway and Vietnam. The UK lottery contract represents AWI's biggest opportunity yet. </p> <p>Answering its critics - chiefly GTech - will be AWI's biggest challenge. The company failed to win the contract to build the online system for the South African Lottery. Regulators were worried AWI did not have the size and resources to oversee the operation. </p> <p>Just like GTech, AWI's lottery systems have suffered serious problems. AWI lost the Arizona State Lottery contract - awarded in 1995 - after its software crashed during tests. </p> <p>Nearly 30 per cent of Arizona's 2,300 lottery termi nals suffered communication problems with AWI's central computer during the first week of operations. Billing problems meant the lottery was unable to collect more than $22 million in instant ticket sales. The software also failed to recognise a leap year. The Arizona system used a software program known as Masterlink - the same system it intends to use in the UK. </p> <p>There have been other embarrassing incidents. The state of Minnesota fined AWI for being late with the implementation of its lottery software after it won the contract in 1994. Four years later, AWI had to reimburse the Maryland State Lottery after a software problem paid out too much to winners. The same year AWI lost its Montana state lottery contract after concerns about the reliability of its support services. </p> <p>Software problems and lost contracts are not that uncommon in the lottery world. But Branson has staked his reputation on providing a better lottery than Camelot. He cannot afford for AWI to let him down.</p> <p>Jamie Doward </p> <p><strong>Trains, planes and mobiles: The world of Richard Branson</strong></p> <p><strong> Virgin Atlantic Airways</strong> 51 per cent. Rest owned by Singapore Airlines </p> <p>The cash cow of the Virgin empire, founded in 1984 and consistently profitable in recent years. Now the second largest British long-haul airline flying across the Atlantic, and to Tokyo, Shanghai and New Delhi. Virgin sold 49 per cent of its stake to Singapore Airlines this year, raising an estimated \u00a3400 million. </p> <p>Business threatened by a deal between Europe and US to open up competition in the airline market. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Express</strong> 54 per cent. Rest is floated. </p> <p>Loss-making European airline based in Brussels. Floated in New York and Brussels. Lost more in the first quarter of 2000 than in all of 1999. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Rail</strong> 51 per cent. Rest owned by Stagecoach </p> <p>The West Coast and cross-country rail services have been the cause of bad publicity for Virgin, but analysts believe they make profits of around \u00a329m. The success of the West Coast line modernisation is essential. Also bidding to run Great North Eastern franchise. </p> <p><strong> Victory Corporation</strong> 55 per cent. Rest floated. </p> <p>The only Virgin company floated in the UK. Branson invested \u00a31,000 for his 50 per cent stake in the cosmetics company, Virgin Vie, but brought the brand. Other partners invested \u00a320m. Virgin Clothing did badly, the cosmetics division less so. The share price has plummeted and it incurred a \u00a321m pre-tax loss last year. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Bride</strong> 100 per cent. </p> <p>Sir Richard donned a wedding dress in 1996 to launch the wedding emporium. Losses almost trebled last year, but has been relaunched as an internet-based business. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Trading Company</strong> (cola/vodka) 100 per cent </p> <p>In 1996, Branson pledged that if Virgin Cola had not overtaken sales of Pepsi in the UK by this year he would shave off his beard. As of last month Virgin Cola had achieved 3 per cent of the market and it has never made a profit. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Energy</strong> 75 per cent. London Electricity 25 per cent. </p> <p>Soon-to-be launched internet-based venture backed by French-owned London Electricity. It aims to attract 300,000 customers for its gas and electricity service. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Mobile</strong> 50 per cent. One2one own 49 per cent </p> <p>Virgin's joint venture with the mobile phone operator to create a 'virtual network'. It piggybacks on one2one's network but offers users different phones and tariffs to 320,000 users. </p> <p><strong> Virgin TV</strong> </p> <p>Set up to table a \u00a322m bid for the Channel 5 licence in 1995. Lost to bid led by Greg Dyke, then at Pearson. In 1991 joined forces with Sir David Frost for the Channel 3 franchise auctions. The Virgin-backed CPV-TV bid for three licenses failed too. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Net</strong> </p> <p>Internet service provider that attracted 400,000 subscribers. Virgin sold its share to partner NTL, for \u00a3100m, last month. Now the focus is on virgin.com, shaped around the minor success of the trainline.com. </p> <p><strong> Virgin Cinemas</strong> </p> <p>Bought from MGM in 1995 for \u00a3110m, and sold on to French company Vivendi four years on for a \u00a3100m profit. </p> <p><strong> Our Price</strong> 75 per cent. </p> <p>Branson has admitted losing between \u00a380m-\u00a3100m on the record shops.

At weekends you can use a Virgin mobile phone or Virgin's internet service to find out what is on at the local Virgin cinema. As you head off on holiday on a Virgin train or plane, you can play Virgin video games stopping only to buy your Virgin vodka in duty free. If you meet someone on the beach and one thing leads to another, the Virgin condoms are in the Virgin hotel minibar. When love blossoms, you get married with Virgin Brides and buy your first house with a Virgin mortgage and get a joint Virgin pension. The lottery provides a classic opportunity for Branson's unique, iconoclastic way of doing things. Robert Jones, a director of Wolff Olins, the branding consultancy, says: 'Branson's success comes from questioning institutions and big businesses, styling himself as the consumers' champion and fighting against rip-offs, bad service and complacency. After the bribery libel action with GTech's former boss [Guy Snowden] and claims that Camelot directors were fat cats, the lottery was a prime target. It had to be him.' Rita Clifton, head of the world's biggest branding firm, Interbrand, says: 'Branson stands for fun. His public image is laid back. The lottery is about fun and it was too good an opportunity to miss.' After his first failure, Branson was not taking chances. He built a much stronger consortium, bringing in partners like AWI, the US gaming experts, advertising agency J Walter Thompson and Microsoft. But something else had changed, too. The Branson consortium had decided to court New Labour. Before coming to power the party stressed a commitment to a non-profit lottery, something Branson had lobbied for for over several years. Branson's consortium - even its name has New Labour overtones - couldn't hide the fact that it was going have to pay suppliers like AWI, so it couldn't claim it was a not-for-profit lottery. But it did a good job of wearing a hair-shirt in public. The People's Lottery Consortium will not pay dividends to shareholders as Camelot has. 'We will make profits but our profits go to good causes,' Jackson says. Branson's ability to tap into New Labour's concerns about Camelot had been an evolutionary process. Once seen as the epitome of a Thatcherite entrepreneur, Branson viciously attacked the Tories after he lost the bid to run the first lottery. 'Of all the decisions I have ever seen any government make over many years, this is perhaps the most crass,' he declared. Throughout New Labour's political transformation during the Nineties, Branson kept the heat on Camelot, with a David and Goliath line. 'Camelot has a licence to print tickets and another to print money. It is another private monopoly set up by a Conservative government and making excessive profits,' Branson said in 1995. The same year, Branson attended the Labour conference and detailed his blueprint for a new lottery. He urged Tony Blair to scrap the way lottery consortium members received millions in dividends and instead to plough proceeds into healthcare and education. Branson tapped into public concern that many projects funded by the National Lottery - especially Millennium celebrations - did little for ordinary people. Better to spend on deserving causes, he argued. And all the time Camelot held the licence, the multi-millionaire Branson made a very public point of never buying a lottery ticket. His ability to read the moods of both the public and the Government had a dramatic effect once he launched a bid. For months it had looked like Camelot was the only player in town. A deal to put lottery terminals in post offices seemed to sound the death knell for any other bidder. Camelot was simply too strong. But once Branson had bid, all bets were off. Stung by accusations of corporate greed, Camelot was forced to slash its directors' pay and bonus packets. Dianne Thompson, Camelot's new chief executive, saw her total potential salary including bonuses slashed to \u00a3330,000, more than a third less than her predecessor. Dividends to consortium members would also be slashed in half, Camelot promised. Branson attacked Camelot head-on with Virgin razzamatazz. Camelot promised to make \u00a315 billion. The People's Lottery said it would make more. Branson's team pointed out how Camelot's ticket sales were tailing off. Camelot's scratchcard sales came in for special criticism. Once they were bringing in \u00a31.5bn a year. Now they make \u00a3500 million. The People's Lottery insisted it could reverse the slide by using 53 balls instead of Camelot's 49 - and allowing punters a one in three million chance of winning \u00a31m, rather than the one in 14 million currently on offer. As the champagne corks popped at Branson's Holland Park HQ on Wednesday, an emotional Thompson was being driven back to Camelot's Watford HQ. She was too stunned to speak. Camelot had decided against booking a venue for a celebration - partly to avoid accusations of triumphalism. Thompson and her team were confident, however, that they would be quietly celebrating. The signs were good. Newspapers said the commission would rule in Camelot's favour. Camelot's army of regulatory personnel, who deal with the National Lottery Commission weekly, had met the commission the previous Wednesday. There was no hint they were about to lose a \u00a315bn game. Camelot executives were worried that the commission's decision to push back the announcement of the winner from June to August might be linked to revelations made by a former GTech employee that the company had covered up a software fault that had meant some players had lost cash prizes. But the commission said the delay was 'merely a matter of logistics'. Nothing could have been more wrong. The commission's 'Statement of Reasons' explaining why Camelot was rejected proves that doubts about GTech's working practices were crucial. 'The commission remains extremely concerned about the behaviour of GTech,' the lottery watchdog said. 'The decision [to hide software problems] was taken against written advice from the general manager of GTech UK that Camelot and Oflot should be told.' On the M1 back to Watford, tears welled up in Thompson's eyes. Arriving at Camelot's HQ, she struggled to compose herself before breaking the news to Camelot's 800 staff. Throughout Wednesday afternoon, senior Camelot members talked to tearful employees. Regional offices were briefed via video conference. Nobody could understand why Branson's consortium had been given a month to modify its bid while theirs had been rejected outright. Camelot's lawyers suggested they appeal in court. It was decided Thompson should go back to London to launch a fightback. A statement was cobbled together. Outside Camelot's plush London HQ off Trafalgar Square, Thompson talked of the consortium's dismay. Having vented her spleen, she sped back to Watford. By half past six she was drinking lager with her staff in a Yates Brothers Wine Lodge in the centre of the town. The contrast with the champagne party at Holland Park could not have been more stark. Thompson didn't tell staff about the impending legal action and left after a couple of hours. She spent Thursday putting the plan into action. On Friday at the High Court, Mr Justice Sullivan ruled that discussions between the commission and The People's Lottery be suspended over the bank holiday weekend until a decision on whether to grant Camelot judicial review is reached. Branson, who contemplated a similar legal move when he lost the lottery back in 1994, said Camelot's decision would damage the lottery's reputation. Perhaps he should have said destroy the lottery's reputation. The chaos surrounding the commission's ruling has left the people's game with a battered public image. Branson believes he can repair it. The epitaphs won't read kindly if he fails. How the lottery fight unfolded 1998 July GTech executives discover phantom ticket fault but opt to cover up the problems. September Branson suggests failure of his original bid due to failing to donate money to Tories. Coincides with release of memoirs. 1999 May Camelot lobbies for 10-year second term, Branson indicates no interest in bidding. June Camelot reports lottery sales down by \u00a3300m on previous year. July Branson begins work on second bid, issues research showing public is 40 per cent more likely to play a lottery with all profits going to good causes. November Branson, still undecided, lobbies government to even the playing field for new bidders. December Lottery Commission says Camelot must replace old terminals if it wins, levelling the playing field. 14 December Branson launches The People's 2000 February Bids submitted, People's Lottery talks about making a millionaire a day. 26 May David Armitage, a former GTech employee, reveals the software glitch that led to the phantom tickets. 23 June Decision to grant lottery licence put back to August by commission after both bids fail to meet required standards. 6 July William O'Connor, GTech chief executive, leaves company in wake of phantom ticket cover-up. 23 August Commission announces that no winner has been chosen, but exclusive negotiations will continue with Branson's consortium. Camelot ruled out because of the GTech cover-up. 25 August Camelot seeks judicial review of commission decision. Branson stakes all on GTech rival Last time around, experts said one of the main reasons Richard Branson's UK Lotteries Ltd managed to come only fourth in the bidding process was because many doubted it would have the technological knowhow to deliver on its pledges. This time, however, Branson teamed up with Automated Wagering International (AWI), a subsidiary of Nevada-based casino company Anchor Gaming and arch- rival of GTech. Wednesday's news that Branson looked likely to win the lottery licence was good news for Anchor's share price. AWI is heavily reliant on two US state lottery contracts - Florida and Pennsylvania - and is keen to develop its operations further afield. This is largely because GTech dominates the US market. AWI runs 16 per cent of all the lottery terminals in the US, compared with GTech's 79 per cent. So far, though, AWI has won only four international lottery contracts - in Chile, China, Norway and Vietnam. The UK lottery contract represents AWI's biggest opportunity yet. Answering its critics - chiefly GTech - will be AWI's biggest challenge. The company failed to win the contract to build the online system for the South African Lottery. Regulators were worried AWI did not have the size and resources to oversee the operation. Just like GTech, AWI's lottery systems have suffered serious problems. AWI lost the Arizona State Lottery contract - awarded in 1995 - after its software crashed during tests. Nearly 30 per cent of Arizona's 2,300 lottery termi nals suffered communication problems with AWI's central computer during the first week of operations. Billing problems meant the lottery was unable to collect more than $22 million in instant ticket sales. The software also failed to recognise a leap year. The Arizona system used a software program known as Masterlink - the same system it intends to use in the UK. There have been other embarrassing incidents. The state of Minnesota fined AWI for being late with the implementation of its lottery software after it won the contract in 1994. Four years later, AWI had to reimburse the Maryland State Lottery after a software problem paid out too much to winners. The same year AWI lost its Montana state lottery contract after concerns about the reliability of its support services. Software problems and lost contracts are not that uncommon in the lottery world. But Branson has staked his reputation on providing a better lottery than Camelot. He cannot afford for AWI to let him down. Jamie Doward Trains, planes and mobiles: The world of Richard Branson Virgin Atlantic Airways 51 per cent. Rest owned by Singapore Airlines The cash cow of the Virgin empire, founded in 1984 and consistently profitable in recent years. Now the second largest British long-haul airline flying across the Atlantic, and to Tokyo, Shanghai and New Delhi. Virgin sold 49 per cent of its stake to Singapore Airlines this year, raising an estimated \u00a3400 million. Business threatened by a deal between Europe and US to open up competition in the airline market. Virgin Express 54 per cent. Rest is floated. Loss-making European airline based in Brussels. Floated in New York and Brussels. Lost more in the first quarter of 2000 than in all of 1999. Virgin Rail 51 per cent. Rest owned by Stagecoach The West Coast and cross-country rail services have been the cause of bad publicity for Virgin, but analysts believe they make profits of around \u00a329m. The success of the West Coast line modernisation is essential. Also bidding to run Great North Eastern franchise. Victory Corporation 55 per cent. Rest floated. The only Virgin company floated in the UK. Branson invested \u00a31,000 for his 50 per cent stake in the cosmetics company, Virgin Vie, but brought the brand. Other partners invested \u00a320m. Virgin Clothing did badly, the cosmetics division less so. The share price has plummeted and it incurred a \u00a321m pre-tax loss last year. Virgin Bride 100 per cent. Sir Richard donned a wedding dress in 1996 to launch the wedding emporium. Losses almost trebled last year, but has been relaunched as an internet-based business. Virgin Trading Company (cola/vodka) 100 per cent In 1996, Branson pledged that if Virgin Cola had not overtaken sales of Pepsi in the UK by this year he would shave off his beard. As of last month Virgin Cola had achieved 3 per cent of the market and it has never made a profit. Virgin Energy 75 per cent. London Electricity 25 per cent. Soon-to-be launched internet-based venture backed by French-owned London Electricity. It aims to attract 300,000 customers for its gas and electricity service. Virgin Mobile 50 per cent. One2one own 49 per cent Virgin's joint venture with the mobile phone operator to create a 'virtual network'. It piggybacks on one2one's network but offers users different phones and tariffs to 320,000 users. Virgin TV Set up to table a \u00a322m bid for the Channel 5 licence in 1995. Lost to bid led by Greg Dyke, then at Pearson. In 1991 joined forces with Sir David Frost for the Channel 3 franchise auctions. The Virgin-backed CPV-TV bid for three licenses failed too. Virgin Net Internet service provider that attracted 400,000 subscribers. Virgin sold its share to partner NTL, for \u00a3100m, last month. Now the focus is on virgin.com, shaped around the minor success of the trainline.com. Virgin Cinemas Bought from MGM in 1995 for \u00a3110m, and sold on to French company Vivendi four years on for a \u00a3100m profit. Our Price 75 per cent. Branson has admitted losing between \u00a380m-\u00a3100m on the record shops. Now transforming Our Price into a chain of 'v.shops', selling electronic gadgets, and enabling customers to settle Virgin energy bills.",

      "trailText": "<p>Shipping heir Stelios Haji-Ioannou made waves with his budget airline Easyjet. Now it's about to float</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou's most sobering experience came when one of his family shipping company's tankers blew up off Genoa in 1991. Five crew died and the accident caused arguably the Mediterranean's worst ecological disaster. </p> <p>Stelios and his father Loucas have since been cleared of blame twice by Italian courts, which threw out charges including manslaughter, causing pollution and attempting to bribe and intimidate witnesses. Investigators have blamed crew error, not the state of repair of the ageing tanker Haven. </p> <p>Hence, on a hot afternoon last week, the now 33-year-old Stelios Haji-Ioannou is not in an Italian jail, but preparing for a November float of a stake in his low-cost airline Easyjet on the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>He was heading in a chauffeur-driven BMW from his largest London internet caf\u00e9 to the airline's base at Luton. He admitted that the tanker accident was a 'psychological factor' in his decision to order brand new Boeings. </p> <p>'It would be wrong to claim that the Haven experience did not affect me. It changed my life,' he said. He tells his staff now that spending a bit extra on maintenance or crew training is worth it. </p> <p>'I tell them if you think safety is expensive, try an accident. You can be worth nothing just because of one mistake. That is not to say there was anything wrong with the Haven, it was a human error. But I am determined that everything has to be 100 per cent safe.' </p> <p>That goes for Easyjet and his new car-hire operation Easyrentacar, which uses Mercedes A-class vehicles. </p> <p>He and other bosses of low-cost airlines in Europe, such as Ryanair and Go, know that growing public confidence in the budget-airline business will be lost if one of their aircraft goes down. </p> <p>Having built up his own firm, Stelmar Tankers, in the family's line of business, Haji-Ioannou started Easyjet with a \u00a35 million loan from his father in 1995. A sceptical UK airline industry said it would never work. He had orange jets with cabin crew in orange T-shirts flying out of the untrendy Luton airport to Glasgow for \u00a329 or, famously, 'the price of a pair of jeans'. </p> <p>It was vulgar but it worked. Five years later the entrepreneur is carrying 3.8 million passengers a year and has 18 737 jets, with 32 on order. He aims to triple passenger numbers and double his staff, at present 1,400, by 2004. </p> <p>He pointed out that the jeans slogan was dropped after a year, and admits that fares are often a lot more than that now. In fact he concedes that there is often a tenfold difference between the price advertised and the price the consumer ends up paying, depending on demand. </p> <p>In addition to Luton, he has set up airline bases in Liverpool and Geneva and plans one for Amsterdam. He has started a chain of 24-hour internet caf\u00e9s called Easyeverything. There is talk of Easybanking on the internet and Haji-Ioannou's fortune being worth anything from \u00a3180m to \u00a3500m (a figure that he cannot clarify). </p> <p>He believes he can paint the world orange on behalf of the little guy. Anyone who gets in his way - such as British Airways - will be sued, reported to the European Commission, trashed in highly personal campaigns in newspapers and on the internet or generally mocked in public. No wonder they call him the next Richard Branson. </p> <p>But there are significant differences between that 50-year-old and the young pretender. Haji-Ioannou was practically born a millionaire and admits openly that he could not have succeeded with Easyjet if his father had not lent him the initial \u00a35m and later injected a further \u00a315m, topped up by \u00a315m that Stelios creamed off from Stelmar Tankers. </p> <p>In a press interview earlier this year, Haji-Ioannou said: 'Let's get one thing straight about this comparison: Branson's some hippy from the Sixties, I'm a university graduate [London School of Economics] who went through formal training to become a businessman. I have a masters [City University], he left school with a couple of O-levels.' A pertinent remark considering that Haji-Ioannou is now marketing himself as a serious businessman in the City. Indeed, speculation surfaced last month that Easyjet could bid for Branson's low-cost offshoot Virgin Express. Industry sources indicate he is much more likely to buy British Airways' Go if it is cheap enough. But Haji-Ioannou said: 'This company will not be distracted from its flotation.' </p> <p>Unlike Branson, Haji-Ioannou is not famous for flirting. He is reportedly single but won't confirm this. When asked, he says he is neither gay nor lonely.

      "bodyText": "Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou's most sobering experience came when one of his family shipping company's tankers blew up off Genoa in 1991. Five crew died and the accident caused arguably the Mediterranean's worst ecological disaster. Stelios and his father Loucas have since been cleared of blame twice by Italian courts, which threw out charges including manslaughter, causing pollution and attempting to bribe and intimidate witnesses. Investigators have blamed crew error, not the state of repair of the ageing tanker Haven. Hence, on a hot afternoon last week, the now 33-year-old Stelios Haji-Ioannou is not in an Italian jail, but preparing for a November float of a stake in his low-cost airline Easyjet on the London Stock Exchange. He was heading in a chauffeur-driven BMW from his largest London internet caf\u00e9 to the airline's base at Luton. He admitted that the tanker accident was a 'psychological factor' in his decision to order brand new Boeings. 'It would be wrong to claim that the Haven experience did not affect me. It changed my life,' he said. He tells his staff now that spending a bit extra on maintenance or crew training is worth it. 'I tell them if you think safety is expensive, try an accident. You can be worth nothing just because of one mistake. That is not to say there was anything wrong with the Haven, it was a human error. But I am determined that everything has to be 100 per cent safe.' That goes for Easyjet and his new car-hire operation Easyrentacar, which uses Mercedes A-class vehicles. He and other bosses of low-cost airlines in Europe, such as Ryanair and Go, know that growing public confidence in the budget-airline business will be lost if one of their aircraft goes down. Having built up his own firm, Stelmar Tankers, in the family's line of business, Haji-Ioannou started Easyjet with a \u00a35 million loan from his father in 1995. A sceptical UK airline industry said it would never work. He had orange jets with cabin crew in orange T-shirts flying out of the untrendy Luton airport to Glasgow for \u00a329 or, famously, 'the price of a pair of jeans'. It was vulgar but it worked. Five years later the entrepreneur is carrying 3.8 million passengers a year and has 18 737 jets, with 32 on order. He aims to triple passenger numbers and double his staff, at present 1,400, by 2004. He pointed out that the jeans slogan was dropped after a year, and admits that fares are often a lot more than that now. In fact he concedes that there is often a tenfold difference between the price advertised and the price the consumer ends up paying, depending on demand. In addition to Luton, he has set up airline bases in Liverpool and Geneva and plans one for Amsterdam. He has started a chain of 24-hour internet caf\u00e9s called Easyeverything. There is talk of Easybanking on the internet and Haji-Ioannou's fortune being worth anything from \u00a3180m to \u00a3500m (a figure that he cannot clarify). He believes he can paint the world orange on behalf of the little guy. Anyone who gets in his way - such as British Airways - will be sued, reported to the European Commission, trashed in highly personal campaigns in newspapers and on the internet or generally mocked in public. No wonder they call him the next Richard Branson. But there are significant differences between that 50-year-old and the young pretender. Haji-Ioannou was practically born a millionaire and admits openly that he could not have succeeded with Easyjet if his father had not lent him the initial \u00a35m and later injected a further \u00a315m, topped up by \u00a315m that Stelios creamed off from Stelmar Tankers. In a press interview earlier this year, Haji-Ioannou said: 'Let's get one thing straight about this comparison: Branson's some hippy from the Sixties, I'm a university graduate [London School of Economics] who went through formal training to become a businessman. I have a masters [City University], he left school with a couple of O-levels.' A pertinent remark considering that Haji-Ioannou is now marketing himself as a serious businessman in the City. Indeed, speculation surfaced last month that Easyjet could bid for Branson's low-cost offshoot Virgin Express. Industry sources indicate he is much more likely to buy British Airways' Go if it is cheap enough. But Haji-Ioannou said: 'This company will not be distracted from its flotation.' Unlike Branson, Haji-Ioannou is not famous for flirting. He is reportedly single but won't confirm this. When asked, he says he is neither gay nor lonely. No more details. He still has deep ties with Greece and Cyprus and it is in Nicosia that part of Stelmar, which has 12 tankers, is in the process of flotation. He said: 'Stelmar's shares were 10 times oversubscribed, and that was for a shipping com pany, not a sexy airline. I had to deal with about 500 friends and family applications - half of Cyprus claims to be my cousin - and I ended up offending and upsetting a lot of people.'

Small investors will not be allowed to apply for shares. The move goes against the 'easy' brand image and Haji-Ioannou admits his decision could be seen as arrogant but feels they will be engulfed.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If content is king of the internet, Auntie BBC might be forgiven for thinking she is its queen by divine right. Look at the way online behemoths are hopping into bed with the biggest content providers, eagerly anticipating the fruits of broadband technology transforming the potential of the world wide web. AOL-Time Warner, Time Warner-EMI, Seagram- Vivendi... it's time to take your partners. </p> <p>There will be more such partnerships as internet firms realise that if they fail to persuade users to tune in regularly they have no unique selling point. And amid all this, the BBC stands out as a content giant. </p> <p>A survey by the promotion group British Trade International claimed the BBC was Britain's most successful export - ahead of the Beatles, Shakespeare and the royal family. So the potential for using the net as a new delivery system for the corporation's wealth of content, allowing it tap into new audiences prepared to pay to watch The Good Life on demand, to whom it can then sell things and build advertising revenues, is huge . </p> <p>The stress on content could end the reign of telecom firms as wonder stocks, and put media companies on top. This is a transformation not lost on Rupert Gavin, ex-head of BT and now chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, which is charged with earning Auntie \u00a3200 million a year by 2006. </p> <p>'In the mid-Nineties, the revenue driver was the communication connection. That was where the money was, and everyone was giving away their content for free. But the communication cost is being marginalised and the differentiation is going to be content,' says Gavin. </p> <p>'It is a concept of people paying in some way, be it subscription or pay-per-use or micro payment. That's where value will be added. </p> <p>Only, of course, it's not as simple as that for the corporation. Its funding through the licence fee means Auntie needs to be careful about how she uses the net to make money. She can't simply build a few websites and start charging everyone for access. </p> <p>But she can divide up her internet activities so that the BBC keeps to its public service commitment by offering content to all, with a separate division dreaming up e-commerce wheezes. </p> <p>Three years ago, even before setting up its BBC Online portal, the corporation started experimenting with how the internet could help swell the coffers of BBC Worldwide which would use the cash to generate new programming for all. The result was beeb.com, originally set up with computer firm ICL. </p> <p>This year Auntie started lavishing more attention on beeb.com, bringing in new staff to overhaul the site. It became a fully fledged e-commerce portal drawing on the strengths of some of Auntie's best programme and magazine brands - including Top of the Pops, Top Gear, Gardeners' World and Holiday . </p> <p>Already one of the top 10 e-commerce sites in the UK, according to research by analysts at consultancy MMXI Europe, beeb.com's success lies in the quality of its content which draws in punters in their thousands and then offers them the chance buy BBC-licensed products ( Walking With Dinosaurs chocolate egg, anyone?) and the ability to click through to partner e-commerce sites. For this beeb.com takes a cut. </p> <p>Last week, in a sign of how seriously Auntie is committed to developing its e-commerce potential, the corporation did what would recently have been unthinkable. It announced a deal with a venture-capital firm, and an American one to boot. </p> <p>TH Lee Global Internet Managers is to plough \u00a332.5m into beeb.com and its free internet service provider cousin, beeb.net. This gives the US firm a 13 per cent stake in a business now valued at \u00a3240m. This might not seem too high considering some dotcom valuations but, given the fact that beeb.com generated revenues of only about \u00a32m last year, Gavin admits it still puts the business on a 'pretty stratospheric rating'. </p> <p>He says UK venture-capital firms were interested in coming in on the deal, but Lee got the nod because of its experience in investing in content-rich internet firms. </p> <p>The aim is for the two businesses to become 'nicely profitable' in between three and four years. Lee is committed for 'up to five years', and has 'not yet specified which exit strategy' it favours for eventually recouping its investment. A partial flotation is the most obvious solution, but how this would work has yet to be thrashed out. </p> <p>What is clear, though, is that Lee's investment will help the BBC do more than turn beeb.com into a sort of Amazon.com for fans of Tinky Winky and Jeremy Clarkson. </p> <p>The really interesting thing is how the cash will be used to help fund the distribution of BBC content over the net. The BBC has been trialling delivery of video on demand (VOD) in this way since last spring. Now it is looking at developing a separately branded site from beeb.com, from which users will be able to download films and programmes, allowing them to watch TV when and how they want, if they pay. </p> <p>'We haven't yet made the decision as to whether we construct our own VOD portal. But it would almost certainly be a different portal to beeb.com, which is all about e-commerce. That said the two portals would relate to each other,' Gavin said. </p> <p>However, he argues that what he describes as 'fuzzy media' is the real key to the BBC's online future. By this he means that the way the net, once broadband is rolled out, will allow for true user interaction via both video and text. </p> <p>So a typical scenario would see a user clicking on a language portal, watching a programme on how to speak French and then being able to pay to download a special course. Quizzes are another obvious area to be explored in this way. Soon we could all be Mastermind . </p> <p>And as for soaps, well if some of the trials now going on are successful we could be downloading all the week's episodes of EastEnders in one go on any day we choose. But only, of course, if we were the prepared to pay. </p> <p>'The fact that one individual chooses the time and methodology to access our content is not something the great mass of licence fee payers should be forced to subsidise,' Gavin said. And the beauty is that such highly rated content, not to mention e-commerce applications, has a global reach. Think of all those dollars. </p> <p>But it is clear in all of this that delineation is of fundamental importance. If UK online users are not aware which part of BBC cyberspace they are in - the commercial or the public service arenas - the damage to the corporation's brand will be tremendous. Managing this sensitively will be Auntie's key to success. </p> <p>She knows, however, that she can't hide from her online commitments, chiefly because they offer it one of the strongest revenue streams for the future - money to help pay for its public-service programmes. </p> <p>As Gavin said: 'The BBC is a content company.

      "bodyText": "If content is king of the internet, Auntie BBC might be forgiven for thinking she is its queen by divine right. Look at the way online behemoths are hopping into bed with the biggest content providers, eagerly anticipating the fruits of broadband technology transforming the potential of the world wide web. AOL-Time Warner, Time Warner-EMI, Seagram- Vivendi... it's time to take your partners. There will be more such partnerships as internet firms realise that if they fail to persuade users to tune in regularly they have no unique selling point. And amid all this, the BBC stands out as a content giant. A survey by the promotion group British Trade International claimed the BBC was Britain's most successful export - ahead of the Beatles, Shakespeare and the royal family. So the potential for using the net as a new delivery system for the corporation's wealth of content, allowing it tap into new audiences prepared to pay to watch The Good Life on demand, to whom it can then sell things and build advertising revenues, is huge . The stress on content could end the reign of telecom firms as wonder stocks, and put media companies on top. This is a transformation not lost on Rupert Gavin, ex-head of BT and now chief executive of BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, which is charged with earning Auntie \u00a3200 million a year by 2006. 'In the mid-Nineties, the revenue driver was the communication connection. That was where the money was, and everyone was giving away their content for free. But the communication cost is being marginalised and the differentiation is going to be content,' says Gavin. 'It is a concept of people paying in some way, be it subscription or pay-per-use or micro payment. That's where value will be added. Only, of course, it's not as simple as that for the corporation. Its funding through the licence fee means Auntie needs to be careful about how she uses the net to make money. She can't simply build a few websites and start charging everyone for access. But she can divide up her internet activities so that the BBC keeps to its public service commitment by offering content to all, with a separate division dreaming up e-commerce wheezes. Three years ago, even before setting up its BBC Online portal, the corporation started experimenting with how the internet could help swell the coffers of BBC Worldwide which would use the cash to generate new programming for all. The result was beeb.com, originally set up with computer firm ICL. This year Auntie started lavishing more attention on beeb.com, bringing in new staff to overhaul the site. It became a fully fledged e-commerce portal drawing on the strengths of some of Auntie's best programme and magazine brands - including Top of the Pops, Top Gear, Gardeners' World and Holiday . Already one of the top 10 e-commerce sites in the UK, according to research by analysts at consultancy MMXI Europe, beeb.com's success lies in the quality of its content which draws in punters in their thousands and then offers them the chance buy BBC-licensed products ( Walking With Dinosaurs chocolate egg, anyone?) and the ability to click through to partner e-commerce sites. For this beeb.com takes a cut. Last week, in a sign of how seriously Auntie is committed to developing its e-commerce potential, the corporation did what would recently have been unthinkable. It announced a deal with a venture-capital firm, and an American one to boot. TH Lee Global Internet Managers is to plough \u00a332.5m into beeb.com and its free internet service provider cousin, beeb.net. This gives the US firm a 13 per cent stake in a business now valued at \u00a3240m. This might not seem too high considering some dotcom valuations but, given the fact that beeb.com generated revenues of only about \u00a32m last year, Gavin admits it still puts the business on a 'pretty stratospheric rating'. He says UK venture-capital firms were interested in coming in on the deal, but Lee got the nod because of its experience in investing in content-rich internet firms. The aim is for the two businesses to become 'nicely profitable' in between three and four years. Lee is committed for 'up to five years', and has 'not yet specified which exit strategy' it favours for eventually recouping its investment. A partial flotation is the most obvious solution, but how this would work has yet to be thrashed out. What is clear, though, is that Lee's investment will help the BBC do more than turn beeb.com into a sort of Amazon.com for fans of Tinky Winky and Jeremy Clarkson. The really interesting thing is how the cash will be used to help fund the distribution of BBC content over the net. The BBC has been trialling delivery of video on demand (VOD) in this way since last spring. Now it is looking at developing a separately branded site from beeb.com, from which users will be able to download films and programmes, allowing them to watch TV when and how they want, if they pay. 'We haven't yet made the decision as to whether we construct our own VOD portal. But it would almost certainly be a different portal to beeb.com, which is all about e-commerce. That said the two portals would relate to each other,' Gavin said. However, he argues that what he describes as 'fuzzy media' is the real key to the BBC's online future. By this he means that the way the net, once broadband is rolled out, will allow for true user interaction via both video and text. So a typical scenario would see a user clicking on a language portal, watching a programme on how to speak French and then being able to pay to download a special course. Quizzes are another obvious area to be explored in this way. Soon we could all be Mastermind . And as for soaps, well if some of the trials now going on are successful we could be downloading all the week's episodes of EastEnders in one go on any day we choose. But only, of course, if we were the prepared to pay. 'The fact that one individual chooses the time and methodology to access our content is not something the great mass of licence fee payers should be forced to subsidise,' Gavin said. And the beauty is that such highly rated content, not to mention e-commerce applications, has a global reach. Think of all those dollars. But it is clear in all of this that delineation is of fundamental importance. If UK online users are not aware which part of BBC cyberspace they are in - the commercial or the public service arenas - the damage to the corporation's brand will be tremendous. Managing this sensitively will be Auntie's key to success. She knows, however, that she can't hide from her online commitments, chiefly because they offer it one of the strongest revenue streams for the future - money to help pay for its public-service programmes. As Gavin said: 'The BBC is a content company. It's not for us to lecture consumers on how they should want to consume their media.'",

They have been plagued by technical problems which disrupted their output and exposed BNFL to the recent devastating slump in electricity prices. </p> <p>But the long-term implications were even nastier. At a stroke Magnox tripled BNFL's potential bill for nuclear clean-ups. The subsidiary that runs the stations, Magnox Electric, calculated in 1997 that decommissioning alone would cost \u00a36.2 billion. This left out the oldest reactors, Calder Hall and Chapel Cross, as well as the price of disposing of the waste. </p> <p>The final cost - and which generation will have to pay it - is now mired in a controversy that has put BNFL on collision course with the industry regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate. </p> <p>The financial implications are huge. The company wants to postpone the work as far into the future as it can because the longer the delay, the less money it has to account for now, as this amount will grow over time. Calculating the present value of these future liabilities is done by the process of discounting. BNFL estimates the liability and then subtracts 2.5 per cent - the discount rate - from it for each year of deferral. The company's plan is to spread the bill over a mind-blowing 135 years, but the regulator wants to cut this to 40 years. </p> <p>Leading nuclear economist Gordon MacKerron of Sussex University says there is 'strong pressure' for earlier clean-up dates. </p> <p>The difficulties stem from the size and complexity of these nuclear hulks. Decommissioning is a three-stage process. Stage one - lasting up to three years - is taking spent fuel from the reactor and its 'cooling ponds' to BNFL's Sellafield site in Cumbria. </p> <p>Stage two is dismantling everything but the reactor, including the massive turbine halls. Then the reactor itself is made secure. This alone takes up to a decade. A parallel problem is that plans for a deep store for nuclear waste were scrapped in 1997, so there is no way yet of dealing with extremely long-lived radioactive materials. </p> <p>These stages are estimated to take about 25 per cent of the costs. </p> <p>The third stage costs most. After remaining in a 'safe' state for a full 135 years - the source of BNFL's accounting scheme - to allow radioactive substances to decay, the reactor is dismantled. This is estimated to take eight years. </p> <p>The planned 135-year wait would give a final decommissioning date of 2150 - putting Britain well behind other nuclear nations. Most countries expect to finish by 2060, with four planning on 2080, says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </p> <p>BNFL's justification for its long deadline involves a trade-off between allowing radioactive substances to decay for a long time to make them safer for the workers involved, and doing the job faster to minimise the risk of radioactivity leaking from the reactor into the environment in the meantime. BNFL argues that the danger to the workers doing complex dismantling early in the process is high, as is the consequence to the environment of any errors. </p> <p>However, Magnox spokesman David Cartwright said BNFL was likely to reduce the wait to 'between 85 and 135 years'. </p> <p>But that will still be too long for the regulator. The NII's head of radioactive waste management and decommissioning, Frances Taylor, pointed out in a recent policy paper that the key radioactive substance in defuelled reactors, cobalt-60, decays quickly, tilting the balance of risk towards earlier decommissioning. </p> <p>'The... arguments we have seen to date do not demonstrate that a significant safety benefit will be gained from deferring final dismantling beyond 40-50 years.' </p> <p>Taylor told The Observer last week: 'Government policy is that decommissioning should happen as soon as is reasonably practicable. But it should also be when the dose to the operator will be lower, or there will be less need to use expensive techniques. They are going to have to be prepared to bring decommissioning forward. The real safety benefits are over by about 50 years.' BNFL, however, says that in the absence of a deep store this period will be too short to deal with waste effectively. </p> <p>Other factors demand shorter periods. Among them is the notion that the generation that caused the mess and benefited from nuclear energy should clear it up. Alongside these ethical arguments is concern that the skills needed to decommission plants may be lost over time. </p> <p>Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace's Bridget Woodman say the risk of exposure to radiation in early decommissioning could be cut if more was spent on labour. </p> <p>'If you have 20 people on eight-hour shifts it is going to cost less, but be more risky than 40 people working four-hour stints,' she says. </p> <p>But the real importance of financial factors is that they reduce the present-day cost through discounting - creating incentives for deferral. </p> <p>Analysis by MacKerron of Sussex University indicates that waiting for 40 years, rather than 135, will cost BNFL an extra \u00a31.5bn. </p> <p>The cut from 135 years to 40 will increase BNFL's discounted costs from \u00a3250 million to \u00a31.75bn, he says. This is a sevenfold increase, adding 13 per cent to what BNFL's total discounted decommissioning costs for all its sites, which now total \u00a311.4bn. </p> <p>Given that BNFL's solvency is now guaranteed by a \u00a33.7bn Government IOU and that its total financial cover for the \u00a311.4bn is \u00a37.6bn, leaving a \u00a33.8bn gap, this will be politically sensitive. </p> <p>MacKerron says: 'There may be some robust discussions between Ministers looking to privatise this thing, and regulators, who seem to be making it less good value.'

      "body": "<p><strong> Das Rheingold</strong> Scottish Opera, Festival Theatre </p> <p><strong> Hilliard Ensemble</strong> Canongate Kirk </p> <p><strong> The Lost Domain</strong> Komedia@Southside </p> <p> From the first glimpse of an elegant, blue-stockinged leg kicking playfully from the Rhine, to the final image of the lustrous Perspex rainbow bridge which leads the doomed gods to Valhalla, Scottish Opera's Das Rheingold cast a potent spell. Rarely does a new Ring cycle begin with such confidence and lucidity, on stage and in the pit. This bodes well for Wagner's four-opera saga of gods, dwarves and dragons, being spread across four seasons leading to a complete cycle in 2003. Perversely, like Wotan's own building plan, this troubled but resolute company rises to ever greater artistic heights as its finances slip further into chaos. </p> <p>A new Ring, especially since an equally promising effort was abandoned for lack of cash in 1991, is its most challenging undertaking yet. Judging by this first instalment, it may also be one of the most rewarding. </p> <p>Under the experienced, unflappable baton of Richard Armstrong, Wednesday's second-night performance surpassed expectation. His sense of pacing and architecture was faultless, drawing a steady symphonic growth from those famous opening E flat arpeggios.

      "bodyText": "Das Rheingold Scottish Opera, Festival Theatre Hilliard Ensemble Canongate Kirk The Lost Domain Komedia@Southside From the first glimpse of an elegant, blue-stockinged leg kicking playfully from the Rhine, to the final image of the lustrous Perspex rainbow bridge which leads the doomed gods to Valhalla, Scottish Opera's Das Rheingold cast a potent spell. Rarely does a new Ring cycle begin with such confidence and lucidity, on stage and in the pit. This bodes well for Wagner's four-opera saga of gods, dwarves and dragons, being spread across four seasons leading to a complete cycle in 2003. Perversely, like Wotan's own building plan, this troubled but resolute company rises to ever greater artistic heights as its finances slip further into chaos. A new Ring, especially since an equally promising effort was abandoned for lack of cash in 1991, is its most challenging undertaking yet. Judging by this first instalment, it may also be one of the most rewarding. Under the experienced, unflappable baton of Richard Armstrong, Wednesday's second-night performance surpassed expectation. His sense of pacing and architecture was faultless, drawing a steady symphonic growth from those famous opening E flat arpeggios. In clumsy hands, this densely plotted forerunner of all prequels, the most action-packed of the four, can seem to lurch nervously from episode to episode, climax to climax. Not here.

Which, if nothing else, proves the comedy talent pool at the Fringe is not quite as shallow or as narrow as everyone says it is. </p> <p>To recap, the five nominations this year are: Dave Gorman, Rich Hall, Lee Mack, Sean Lock and Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight. The last has received almost unanimous approval due to the fact that a) it was completely unknown before the festival, and thus counts as 'unpredictable'; b) the name on the poster sounds vaguely foreign, and is thus 'exotic'; c) it has a title other than the protagonist's name, and is thus 'unusual'; d) it's really funny and original. </p> <p>Marenghi, the lead character, is a perfectly observed pulp-horror writer: deep-voiced, slick-back-haired, dark-suited and purple-tied, famed for his Slicer trilogy. With the aid of his publicist and two mime artists, Marenghi has adapted his novella about a horror writer with writer's block into an Edinburgh stage play in a doomed bid for the one thing that has always eluded him - critical acclaim. As a character, he is midway between the pathetically self-deluding Alan Partridge and the unwittingly hilarious portentousness of Spinal Tap 's Nigel. </p> <p>Sharply written and performed, Wednesday night's show had the added value of a fire alarm. Marenghi, after half a second of looking fazed, went straight back into character and growled mysteriously: 'Fire - my old enemy!' Garth Marenghi is a character which could, like Al Murray's Pub Landlord , develop into something even darker and deeper in the next few years. Then again, it could follow horror tradition, in which case the sequels will be exploitative, self-referential shite. In either case, I'm looking forward to it. </p> <p>The other four nominees suffer in comparison from being relatively established names and, more damningly, from having short, blokey names. The near-rhyme of 'Mack' and 'Lock', and indeed of 'Gorman' and 'boring', not to mention the utter commonality of Dave, Rich, Lee and Sean, is surefire proof that the comedy scene is a masculine closed shop, where only monosyllabic geezers are welcome. </p> <p>This is, of course, miles from the truth. As I wrote in week one, Rich Hall's Otis Lee Crenshaw (the name of his alter-ego ex-con country singer) is a sublime union of comedy and music, daring and yet comfortingly warm. Dave Gorman's show, too, is intelligent, original and slightly insane. Lee Mack's New Bits is less inventive - it's basically a one-hour TV sketch show, slick and amusing but over-reliant on Mack's Coogan-esque anti-charm and a slew of televisual references. Sean Lock, meanwhile, is, like Harry Hill, surrealism lite - all off-the-wall observations and inappropriate facial expressions. Inoffensive, at worst. </p> <p>The real outcry has arisen over the absentees from the shortlist - notably Auto boosh, who surely suffered a backlash as overwhelming pre-festival favourites, and Scott Capurro, whose show is essentially a mass slaughter of sacred cows. My personal favourite was Noble and Silver, by far the most inventive comedy act on the Fringe. </p> <p>However, this is the problem with judgment by committee: artists who are controversial or unusual, who divide opinion and rile people, tend to suffer under the Perrier panel's proportional representation voting system. </p> <p>This section went to press before the midnight announcement of the winner last night in Edinburgh. So here is my multiple-choice critical reaction (please delete as appropriate): </p> <p>a) Rich Hall's success is fully deserved - he was by far the most naturally funny, linguistically rich, dizzyingly enjoyable act at the festival. Someone should buy him a seedy underground bar in south London so Otis Lee Crenshaw and his band can play all night every night in an atmosphere of bourbon, tears and 100 per cent humidity. </p> <p>b) The decision to give the Perrier prize to Dave Gorman/ Lee Mack/ Sean Lock/ Garth Marengui's Fright Knight represents a massive failure of nerve on behalf of the Perrier panel. These people should be exposed for what they are - a white-bloke-dumb-heterosexual-mainstream-elitist bunch of corporate cocksuckers with pigs' ears for brains and Polo mints for eyes.

It's not the most perfectly shaped: the dramatist Daniel Danis and the Canadian theatre group One Yellow Rabbit have made a mini-saga out of an incident. But it's shot through with an original weirdness. </p> <p>It has invented a wild eloquence for its characters, who speak of terror in childlike accents. It has an unnerving appearance; none of its movements are predictable. Its staging and its vocabulary are all of one unsettling piece. </p> <p>A wooden timber-frame topped with a weathercock serves as the outline of a backwoods cabin in which three brothers and their sister are orphaned when a bolt of lightning strikes. Later, wheeled across the stage, this very unstable home becomes a cage. </p> <p>The brothers, who are eerily similar with identical boiler-suits and synchronised gestures, which can break into a hillbilly hoe-down, pop their sister into this. They guard her, they display her, and they abuse her. A 'red, red clot' on her brain has changed her from a talented country singer - a dimpling figure in gingham and glitter who swishes her petticoats as the audience enters - to an unresponsive body who is strung up in her brothers' harness like a piece of wet washing. Care can be a prison, the play suggests. </p> <p>A Dutch company is responsible for the most surprising theatrical coup of the Festival. Under the direction of Johan Simons, Jeroen Willems's one-man show is an intricate and scalding denunciation of the free market. </p> <p>The text of Voices is taken from statements by Pier Paolo Pasolini and the chairman of Shell International. Its manner shifts startlingly. Five bigwigs are portrayed with an intense realism which could be rivalled only by Johns Fortune and Bird. But every so often this realism is disturbed by a vein of grotesque fantasy, of Fellini-like extravagance. </p> <p>Set around an opulent but dishevelled dinner table, Voices opens with some donnish reflections - delivered by a crumpled, hesitant figure who sidles into the theatre as if by accident, with his napkin stuffed into his collar - on how to survive the loss of humanist belief. </p> <p>It goes on to include a drag act, a detailed dissection of one man's wolfish smile, a story about meeting the Devil, a wordless episode when Willems's tongue gets completely out of control and behaves like a terrible sea-serpent, and a defence of the ethics of multinationals. 'Reality doesn't have interruptions,' declares Willems's first character. The skill of Voices is to pick this notion apart - and then to prove it true. </p> <p>To watch Hopeless Games is to see mood-setting images, normally glimpsed out of the corner of an eye, invading the centre of the stage. It is like seeing something subterranean rise to the surface of a pond. </p> <p>This sequence of danced stories - the result of a wordless collaboration between the Do theatre of St Petersburg and the Fabrik company from Potsdam - begins with a headless squat overcoat waddling across the stage, as if tugged by the balloon it carries. It proceeds with a coat-rack writhing into many-limbed life, and interlaces its doleful acrobatic sequences with video footage. Framed by the lashes of an enormous eye, a train is seen rushing towards the audience and the band of (mostly shaven-headed) performers. As fireworks burst across the screen, the form of their bodies disappear under the patterns of exploding flowers. The melancholic images in Hopeless Games are memorable: they should be harnessed to a story, not left evocatively wafting. After Edinburgh, the show tours England, Europe and Ireland. </p> <p>You'd think it would be almost impossible to make a dull play out of the performances - biographical and cinematic - of Orson Welles. But the Siti Company, New York has managed it with War of the Worlds. Setting their investigation in front of a big silver-framed screen, they've come up with a horde of clangingly obvious formulations about the director's art - 'magic' features largely. </p> <p>The acting is so wooden that for a long time you suspect parody. As Welles, Stephen Webber bellows expressionlessly or sonorously intones. When period flavour is required, an actress flings herself on to the stage, shrieks and throws her beads and arms into the air. Every time a phrase by Welles or a description of his work is quoted, it serves as a criticism of what's being seen. 'Depth of field and sharpness of focus' enthuses one fan: this piece is shallow and fuzzy. </p> <p>The same company has produced Cabin Pressure, an inert examination of the idea that 'being an audience is a creative act' which reduces its watchers to stunned passivity. The piece was conceived by Anne Bogart, who has brought together snatches from a number of plays - the warring couples from Private Lives and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? share a stage - and added a number of quotations from theatrical sages. She has mixed in some dull audience reactions to one performance - one person says it was pretty, another didn't feel very comfortable - which are repeated with minor variations throughout the evening. </p> <p>She has also set up some would-be provocative stagings. As the audience settle into their seats, a scene is in full flood. From time to time the lights go on and off in the auditorium, while the actors continue to perform. Occasionally the performers are seen as if from backstage. </p> <p>To have any point at all, this should influence audience behaviour. It didn't. The performance was accompanied by the customary cross rustle of macs from walk-outs, but when a mobile phone went off, people shushed its owner as if it were an interruption, when surely it should have been deemed an act of creative participation? One day, declares one of the actors in Cabin Pressure, 'an audience will rise to its feet and say who do you think we are?' Let's hope so.</p>",

A 'red, red clot' on her brain has changed her from a talented country singer - a dimpling figure in gingham and glitter who swishes her petticoats as the audience enters - to an unresponsive body who is strung up in her brothers' harness like a piece of wet washing. Care can be a prison, the play suggests. A Dutch company is responsible for the most surprising theatrical coup of the Festival. Under the direction of Johan Simons, Jeroen Willems's one-man show is an intricate and scalding denunciation of the free market. The text of Voices is taken from statements by Pier Paolo Pasolini and the chairman of Shell International. Its manner shifts startlingly. Five bigwigs are portrayed with an intense realism which could be rivalled only by Johns Fortune and Bird. But every so often this realism is disturbed by a vein of grotesque fantasy, of Fellini-like extravagance. Set around an opulent but dishevelled dinner table, Voices opens with some donnish reflections - delivered by a crumpled, hesitant figure who sidles into the theatre as if by accident, with his napkin stuffed into his collar - on how to survive the loss of humanist belief. It goes on to include a drag act, a detailed dissection of one man's wolfish smile, a story about meeting the Devil, a wordless episode when Willems's tongue gets completely out of control and behaves like a terrible sea-serpent, and a defence of the ethics of multinationals. 'Reality doesn't have interruptions,' declares Willems's first character. The skill of Voices is to pick this notion apart - and then to prove it true. To watch Hopeless Games is to see mood-setting images, normally glimpsed out of the corner of an eye, invading the centre of the stage. It is like seeing something subterranean rise to the surface of a pond. This sequence of danced stories - the result of a wordless collaboration between the Do theatre of St Petersburg and the Fabrik company from Potsdam - begins with a headless squat overcoat waddling across the stage, as if tugged by the balloon it carries. It proceeds with a coat-rack writhing into many-limbed life, and interlaces its doleful acrobatic sequences with video footage. Framed by the lashes of an enormous eye, a train is seen rushing towards the audience and the band of (mostly shaven-headed) performers. As fireworks burst across the screen, the form of their bodies disappear under the patterns of exploding flowers. The melancholic images in Hopeless Games are memorable: they should be harnessed to a story, not left evocatively wafting. After Edinburgh, the show tours England, Europe and Ireland. You'd think it would be almost impossible to make a dull play out of the performances - biographical and cinematic - of Orson Welles. But the Siti Company, New York has managed it with War of the Worlds. Setting their investigation in front of a big silver-framed screen, they've come up with a horde of clangingly obvious formulations about the director's art - 'magic' features largely. The acting is so wooden that for a long time you suspect parody. As Welles, Stephen Webber bellows expressionlessly or sonorously intones. When period flavour is required, an actress flings herself on to the stage, shrieks and throws her beads and arms into the air. Every time a phrase by Welles or a description of his work is quoted, it serves as a criticism of what's being seen. 'Depth of field and sharpness of focus' enthuses one fan: this piece is shallow and fuzzy. The same company has produced Cabin Pressure, an inert examination of the idea that 'being an audience is a creative act' which reduces its watchers to stunned passivity. The piece was conceived by Anne Bogart, who has brought together snatches from a number of plays - the warring couples from Private Lives and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? share a stage - and added a number of quotations from theatrical sages. She has mixed in some dull audience reactions to one performance - one person says it was pretty, another didn't feel very comfortable - which are repeated with minor variations throughout the evening. She has also set up some would-be provocative stagings. As the audience settle into their seats, a scene is in full flood. From time to time the lights go on and off in the auditorium, while the actors continue to perform. Occasionally the performers are seen as if from backstage. To have any point at all, this should influence audience behaviour. It didn't. The performance was accompanied by the customary cross rustle of macs from walk-outs, but when a mobile phone went off, people shushed its owner as if it were an interruption, when surely it should have been deemed an act of creative participation? One day, declares one of the actors in Cabin Pressure, 'an audience will rise to its feet and say who do you think we are?' Let's hope so.",

Whatever Terry Waite felt, as he stumbled into freedom after his years of captivity, is as nothing compared to the rush of exultation we felt as the curtain fell on this interminable crud. If Chaucer were alive today, and armed with a shotgun, there wouldn't be a jury in the land who'd convict. </p> <p> <strong> Most presumptuous production</strong> </p> <p> Four Little Plays Called Rape by Henry Layte. I know that Mr Layte is going to think that I can't deal with the philosophical reach and shocking truthfulness of his writing, but what I actually can't deal with is naive drama school graduates who think they've earned the right to prance around a stage pretending to be rape victims. I suspect Mr Layte has never been forcibly violated. But if he wants to get in touch, I'll be happy to oblige. </p> <p> <strong> Most terrifying person at the Fringe</strong> </p> <p> Tom Brooke from Four Little Plays Called Rape. I watched him as he danced to Roxy Music with faeces smeared round his mouth. Now he follows me around Edinburgh asking: 'Do you work for The Observer?' I'm genuinely scared.</p>",

Last year they made their proud parents and grandparents sit through the 'morning glory' erection song. This year, they triumph with a delightful little ditty called 'Premature Ejaculation'. Come on Grandma, sing along! Worst punchline 'Now get out of the way before I drop one in my knickers.' ( Dark Suits, Fast Laughs at Gilded Balloon) Worst line Runners Up : 'I'm too old to be dragging my huge penis out of bed at five o'clock in the morning.' (The Burning Orphanage Show at Caf\u00e9 Royal). 'Why this sudden need to discuss the ethics of the global economy?' (Customer/No Ties at Calton Centre). 'Jake - we have Aids.' (Dark Suits, Fast Laughs). 'I can't go with my feelings right now because I'm obsessed with a dead king.' (Two Days Of Grace At Middleham at Augustines) 'If you want to see rape, Mr Tidcombe, I'll show you rape.' (Ubersausage at C-two Venue) 'I think I can feel another one of my arse proverbs coming on...' (Asbestos Uncle-Eggs at the Garage) 'When I looked at this big pile of dung, I realised it wasn't a big pile of dung. It was a big pile of bureaucracy.' (Ezekial Falling at Bongo Club) Winner: 'Tom, Tom, wake up! It's me - Max Ernst.' (Asbestos Uncle-Eggs) Most baffling satirical moment Dracula's Foot And Other Objects Not Normally Found In A Hamper at C Venue. A bizarre 'topical' reference from the show's host, Moses: 'A little bird told me. Actu ally, it wasn't a bird, it was Tony Blair in a cat suit. Grrr! Who's the cat, Tony? Who's the cat?' If anyone can tell me what that means, I'll give them \u00a375. Best song From The Burning Orphanage Show : 'Like Water Off A Duck's Cock' - as performed by Ringo Starr. Best show Runner Up: The Burning Orphanage Show . 'All right, all right, enough of the biscuit jokes!' shouts the thinner of the two performers. Needless to say, the biscuit jokes are being delivered by a shortbread hand-puppet of the FBI baddie from the X-Files . I find myself yelling for more. But too late. Ringo Starr has come on to sing about a duck's genitals. Winner: The Wacky World Of Henrietta Burton-Crump at Garage Theatre. I prostrate myself at the feet of Crump. Song after peculiar song spills from her frothing mouth, to leave the audience giddy and spent. Resplendent in her tutu and frilly pink pants, she sings about screwing her kung-fu instructor and the effects of a vodka laxative. 'Down the loo - oooh! Cellulite is squeezed... ' I saw this show twice. Any more and I might have died from joy. Most gratuitous swearing Runners Up: 'He wasn't a fucking fireman. He was an anti-fascist idealist.' (Asbestos Uncle-Eggs) 'He was no hero. He was the fucking opposite.' (Two Days Of Grace At Middleham) Winner: 'I stick my fat royal cock into her little royal mouth until I spunk my royal load over her majestic face.' (Four Little Plays Called Rape at Diverse Attractions) Worst show Runner Up: The Potato Play at Greyfriars Kirk House. The most execrable drama about a potato farm murder conspiracy I've ever seen. And I've seen a few. Winner: Chaucer In The Sky With Diamonds at C Venue. Whatever Terry Waite felt, as he stumbled into freedom after his years of captivity, is as nothing compared to the rush of exultation we felt as the curtain fell on this interminable crud. If Chaucer were alive today, and armed with a shotgun, there wouldn't be a jury in the land who'd convict. Most presumptuous production Four Little Plays Called Rape by Henry Layte. I know that Mr Layte is going to think that I can't deal with the philosophical reach and shocking truthfulness of his writing, but what I actually can't deal with is naive drama school graduates who think they've earned the right to prance around a stage pretending to be rape victims. I suspect Mr Layte has never been forcibly violated. But if he wants to get in touch, I'll be happy to oblige. Most terrifying person at the Fringe Tom Brooke from Four Little Plays Called Rape. I watched him as he danced to Roxy Music with faeces smeared round his mouth. Now he follows me around Edinburgh asking: 'Do you work for The Observer?' I'm genuinely scared.",

      "body": "<p>' Hell-oh,' says Ren\u00e9e Zellweger primly. For a native of Texas, a state where everything is bigger, including the vowels, the clipped accent comes as a surprise. There is a reason for it, of course. Zellweger is playing Bridget Jones in the film adaptation of Helen Fielding's bestselling diary. She's been living in London, practising the Queen's English 12 hours a day, from the moment she leaves her Kensington flat to the minute her driver drops her back at bedtime. </p> <p>Zellweger is off-duty, so her speech patterns should have reverted back to a Southern drawl. But the vestiges of the crash-course phonetics (courtesy of voice coach Barbara Berkery, who tutored Gwyneth Paltrow) cannot be erased that easily. Zellweger happily goes into great detail about the mechanics of an English accent (it's all about vowel sounds and diphthongs, apparently). She'll tell you, too, how talking like a native helps her avoid being ripped off by xenophobic cabbies. </p> <p>'It's become a habit,' she says. 'Now I wake up and I talk like that, and I answer the telephone like that and when I go out, I go out like that.' </p> <p>An English accent, of course, is imperative for the role of Bridget Jones. Doubly so given the almighty fuss in the press when it was announced that this petite Texan missy - not Kate, not Helena, nor any one of a dozen other British actresses - had been chosen to play the nation's favourite Chardonnay-swilling singleton. </p> <p>'The criticism has been hurtful,' concedes Zellweger (speaking Texan now). 'Not the bit about the fact that an American girl is playing this part. I can understand that. But it's the extremes to which it's taken. They'll slip something else in there like, \"Nobody has even heard of her before\"; \"What's she ever done?\"; \"The unknown Texan comic\". That's hurtful, d'ya know?' </p> <p>Whoever branded her an 'unknown' clearly didn't see her in the romantic comedy Jerry Maguire. As Tom Cruise's love interest, her performance helped the film to take $240m at the box office. Since then, Zellweger not only commands $3m a picture, she has also found herself, with current partner Jim Carrey (star of The Truman Show ), half of an A-list couple. </p> <p>Today she's taking a break from Bridget. She's at the Dorchester Hotel to publicise Me, Myself &amp; Irene , directed by the Farrelly brothers, which has also enjoyed an exceptional run at the US box office - $88m and rising. Fresh-faced and prone to giggles - she has a habit of burying her face in her hands with mock wails of embarrassment - she seems younger than her 31 years. She explains how her relationship with Jim Carrey was kindled during the filming of Me, Myself &amp; Irene . Though wary of it sounding like a tacky on-set fling, it was not, she insists, where they met. 'We have business associates in common and a couple of mutual friends, so I'd known about him and said hello and things for a long time, and then met him a couple of years ago at a dinner party. So I'd known him for a while.' </p> <p>The consensus among US critics is that Me, Myself &amp; Irene has not merely out-grossed the Farrellys' previous films, but 'out-grossed' them too, making the toilet humour of There's Something About Mary seem like good clean family fun. 'Whether it becomes offensive depends largely on what your intentions are,' says Zellweger. 'They [the Farrelly brothers] are kind-hearted people. They don't tell these jokes with malicious intent.' </p> <p>Carrey plays a policeman with a Jekyll and Hyde syndrome, each half of his split personality having designs on Irene (Zellweger), the girl who's in his custody on a cross-country trip. No subject is beyond ridicule - bodily functions, black midgets, albino waiters, dead cows. </p> <p>Her parents have seen the film, but she hasn't had a response from them yet ('I warned them, but they were looking forward to it,' she laughs). It's harmless fun, she insists. 'And anyway, it's refreshing to move in a different direction and try something new.' However, not everyone is as amused. In the States, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) has objected, claiming the film makes light of schizophrenia. </p> <p>Next week, Zellweger can also be seen in another black comedy, Nurse Betty, co- starring Morgan Freeman. She plays a psychologically disturbed woman who, following the murder of her husband, becomes obsessed with a soap star. One of the central themes is the question of celebrity, and given that her own life has changed considerably over the past three years, this has great resonance for Zellweger - especially now that she's dating Carrey. </p> <p>She can understand the attention, she says, especially in Carrey's case, because 'he makes so many people happy'. Nonetheless, the Carrey liaison has brought intense scrutiny, making the couple very defensive, especially as Carrey is known as a serial dater of his female co-stars. (Carrey dismisses the snide comments: 'The fact is you live where you live, you work where you work, and a lot of people meet their significant other at work.') </p> <p>'It's strange,' she says. 'I have a very difficult time justifying the attention sometimes. So much so that I play down everything, even the good things. It was actually my New Year's resolution to enjoy myself more. But yeah, I have a very difficult time justifying it. You go down a carpet and people scream your name and clap. For what? Because you're lucky ? You know, I'm lucky. I get to do what I love to do and make a living at it, and that's pretty extraordinary.' </p> <p> Ren\u00e9e Zellweger was born in Katy, Texas, a pit-stop on the highway 30 miles west of Houston. She has a Norwegian mother and a Swiss father, hence the unwieldy surname, which, in a previous Hollywood age, would have been the first thing to go. Emil Zellweger, an engineer, spent his formative years in Australia. When he met Kjellfrid Irene, a nurse whose work took her to Texas, he decided to follow. Ren\u00e9e and her older brother grew up in Austin, the state capital. Her parents no longer live there - they moved to Florida - but it's still very much where Zellweger's heart lies. </p> <p>At the University of Texas, she studied drama merely as a supplement to her journalism course, but it wasn't long before it became a passion. She took the usual route through local stagework, commercials, then low-budget films. Her first was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it bit in local director Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused (1993), regarded as something of a slacker classic. Then came Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation , which lay hidden for four years, released only to cash in on Jerry Maguire . In both those films she appeared with fellow Texan and struggling actor, Matthew McConaughey. It was fortuitous. McConaughey tipped her off about a part in a bargain-basement, Natural Born Killers knock-off called Love and a .45 , and Zellweger won cult raves as Starlene, the white and trashy murderer on the run. </p> <p>In 1995, Zellweger moved to Hollywood, working in a bar while taking small parts in films like Empire Records and Reality Bites until she won her first lead, opposite Vincent D'Onofrio in The Whole Wide World, the story of comic-book writer Robert E Howard. </p> <p>And then came something that can only be described as a Ren\u00e9e Zellweger speciality. While the obvious candidates were scratching each other's eyes out to star opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire, Zellweger crept up on the inside. At the audition, barely believing she was in the same room as Cruise, things took an interesting turn when he improvised a drunken scene and fondled her breast. The stunt was designed to deter frailer applicants, but Zellweger kept her cool. And, ahead of bigger names - Patricia Arquette, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder - she bagged the part. Indeed, she fairly stole the picture, shining as Dorothy, the single mother who falls for Cruise. She played the part perfectly: naive yet world-weary, cute and lovable, but also sexy. </p> <p> Jerry Maguire 's writer/director Cameron Crowe admits that casting Zellweger opposite Cruise was a risk. But she brought what he calls 'that Billy Wilder, bittersweet romantic feeling, like Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment '. He goes as far as to put the success of the film down to Zellweger. 'Even with Tom being as great as he is in the movie, having someone not delivering on the reality level would have sunk the movie.' </p> <p>Despite the acclaim, Zellweger rejected high-profile offers in favour of a more eclectic mix of projects which, though hit and miss, have kept her career interesting. </p> <p>When it was announced in February that the role of the very British Bridget Jones would be going to an American, the newspapers had a field day. 'As Bridget approaches 40, she is to be played by a pert-breasted nymphet barely out of her teens,' said The Times . 'Of all the clunking, Hollywood idiocy. The only funny thing about Bridget Jones is that she's not young and perfect,' piled on The Evening Standard . 'Casting her as a young and perfect thing is like remaking The Elephant Man with Jude Law.' </p> <p>According to Jonathan Cavendish, producer of the film, the decision to go with Zellweger was not taken lightly. It was a two- year search to find the right actress. And though they met the obvious candidates ('all the people you'd expect us to look at'), it was Zellweger who knocked them out. </p> <p>'The problem with something that is so defined in terms of people's perception as the character of Bridget Jones is that we had a very clear idea of who we were looking for,' he explains. 'They had to be the person. When Ren\u00e9e walked into the room, Sharon [Maguire, the director] and I looked at one another and said, \"This is Bridget.\"' </p> <p>It makes marketing sense, too. Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill scored massively overseas courtesy of their American stars, Andie MacDowell and Julia Roberts. Bridget Jones is, effectively, the third instalment of a trilogy, made by the same gang (Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, et al). Helen Fielding - who now lives in LA - has given Zellweger her blessing. As executive producer (not to mention a big mate of Curtis and Maguire's), she had a consultant role in casting ('She was kept very closely informed all the time,' says Cavendish). Fielding and Zellweger get on well (the author turned up on-set to hobnob recently). When Fielding appeared to criticise the project at a book function, Zellweger interpreted the comments as a joke. 'They ah sked her about this American girl, this actress being cast, and she said she was just upset that they hadn't ah sked her ,' says Zellweger, all Liza Dolittle again. 'Not that they hadn't ah sked her about casting, but that they hadn't ah sked her if she'd play Bridget Jones. That's what she meant.' 'Helen's been nothing but entirely supportive,' Cavendish asserts. </p> <p>However, bracing himself for the howls of indignation that would inevitably follow the announcement that the part had gone to an American, he insisted that Zellweger come to England for three months to perfect the accent and, importantly, 'to immerse herself in Bridget's world' by gaining real work experience in a London media office. </p> <p>And so, while Bridgetgate raged, Zellweger was merrily toiling away undercover as a trainee in the publicity offices of Picador, Fielding's publisher. There, she posed as Jonathan Cavendish's sister. And, for three weeks in April, the staff barely batted an eyelid as new girl 'Bridget Cavendish' kept hours of 9.30 till 5.30, answered phones, photocopied, went to meetings. Their only concern was that when asked to buy cakes for someone's birthday, she came back with \u00a3100-worth of hand-made tarts, paid for out of her own pocket. (In a similar act of generosity, Zellweger instantly won over the Bridget Jones film crew by ordering \u00a3400-worth of pizza.) </p> <p>'She really helped me because I was short-staffed. It wasn't just me doing whoever a favour,' insists Camilla Elworthy, head of publicity and the only one in on the secret. Indeed, Zellweger was so helpful that one of the senior publishers asked if Ms Cavendish would be interested in a full-time job. </p> <p>'I only had to take one person into my confidence,' says Elworthy. 'Somebody who I kept hearing saying to people, \"Doesn't Bridget look like that actress from Jerry Maguire .\" I said, \"That's because she is the girl from Jerry Maguire . Now please be quiet!\"' Though colleagues often wondered where Zellweger disappeared to at lunch-times (she was either meeting her voice coach or stuffing herself with pizza in a bid to put on a stone in weight for the role), and men were swatted away by Elworthy when their attentions became too amorous, no one else on the Picador staff twigged that Zellweger was an American, let alone a Hollywood star. </p> <p>And the cruel irony of the exercise? Part of the trainee's job was to go through the daily papers each morning, cutting out articles that pertained to any of Picador's books. There were, Bridget Cavendish found, many vitriolic tirades against an oddly named American actress, an 'unknown Texan comic'. 'Yeah, yeaaaaah,' she winces. 'I had to cut them out and file them as part of my job. I couldn't avoid it.' </p> <p>Zellweger smiles again. Next spring, when she comes back to do publicity, the British public will get their chance to determine whether she's pulled it off. </p> <p>'We'll see, I guess, won't we?' she chuckles. 'If I'm lynched and hanging off Tower Bridge, we'll see...'</p> <p>\u0095 Nurse Betty opens on 1 September, and Me, Myself &amp; Irene on 22 September</p>",

In both those films she appeared with fellow Texan and struggling actor, Matthew McConaughey. It was fortuitous. McConaughey tipped her off about a part in a bargain-basement, Natural Born Killers knock-off called Love and a .45 , and Zellweger won cult raves as Starlene, the white and trashy murderer on the run. In 1995, Zellweger moved to Hollywood, working in a bar while taking small parts in films like Empire Records and Reality Bites until she won her first lead, opposite Vincent D'Onofrio in The Whole Wide World, the story of comic-book writer Robert E Howard. And then came something that can only be described as a Ren\u00e9e Zellweger speciality. While the obvious candidates were scratching each other's eyes out to star opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire, Zellweger crept up on the inside. At the audition, barely believing she was in the same room as Cruise, things took an interesting turn when he improvised a drunken scene and fondled her breast. The stunt was designed to deter frailer applicants, but Zellweger kept her cool. And, ahead of bigger names - Patricia Arquette, Bridget Fonda, Winona Ryder - she bagged the part. Indeed, she fairly stole the picture, shining as Dorothy, the single mother who falls for Cruise. She played the part perfectly: naive yet world-weary, cute and lovable, but also sexy. Jerry Maguire 's writer/director Cameron Crowe admits that casting Zellweger opposite Cruise was a risk. But she brought what he calls 'that Billy Wilder, bittersweet romantic feeling, like Shirley MacLaine in The Apartment '. He goes as far as to put the success of the film down to Zellweger. 'Even with Tom being as great as he is in the movie, having someone not delivering on the reality level would have sunk the movie.' Despite the acclaim, Zellweger rejected high-profile offers in favour of a more eclectic mix of projects which, though hit and miss, have kept her career interesting. When it was announced in February that the role of the very British Bridget Jones would be going to an American, the newspapers had a field day. 'As Bridget approaches 40, she is to be played by a pert-breasted nymphet barely out of her teens,' said The Times . 'Of all the clunking, Hollywood idiocy. The only funny thing about Bridget Jones is that she's not young and perfect,' piled on The Evening Standard . 'Casting her as a young and perfect thing is like remaking The Elephant Man with Jude Law.' According to Jonathan Cavendish, producer of the film, the decision to go with Zellweger was not taken lightly. It was a two- year search to find the right actress. And though they met the obvious candidates ('all the people you'd expect us to look at'), it was Zellweger who knocked them out. 'The problem with something that is so defined in terms of people's perception as the character of Bridget Jones is that we had a very clear idea of who we were looking for,' he explains. 'They had to be the person. When Ren\u00e9e walked into the room, Sharon [Maguire, the director] and I looked at one another and said, \"This is Bridget.\"' It makes marketing sense, too. Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill scored massively overseas courtesy of their American stars, Andie MacDowell and Julia Roberts. Bridget Jones is, effectively, the third instalment of a trilogy, made by the same gang (Richard Curtis, Hugh Grant, et al). Helen Fielding - who now lives in LA - has given Zellweger her blessing. As executive producer (not to mention a big mate of Curtis and Maguire's), she had a consultant role in casting ('She was kept very closely informed all the time,' says Cavendish). Fielding and Zellweger get on well (the author turned up on-set to hobnob recently). When Fielding appeared to criticise the project at a book function, Zellweger interpreted the comments as a joke. 'They ah sked her about this American girl, this actress being cast, and she said she was just upset that they hadn't ah sked her ,' says Zellweger, all Liza Dolittle again. 'Not that they hadn't ah sked her about casting, but that they hadn't ah sked her if she'd play Bridget Jones. That's what she meant.' 'Helen's been nothing but entirely supportive,' Cavendish asserts. However, bracing himself for the howls of indignation that would inevitably follow the announcement that the part had gone to an American, he insisted that Zellweger come to England for three months to perfect the accent and, importantly, 'to immerse herself in Bridget's world' by gaining real work experience in a London media office. And so, while Bridgetgate raged, Zellweger was merrily toiling away undercover as a trainee in the publicity offices of Picador, Fielding's publisher. There, she posed as Jonathan Cavendish's sister. And, for three weeks in April, the staff barely batted an eyelid as new girl 'Bridget Cavendish' kept hours of 9.30 till 5.30, answered phones, photocopied, went to meetings. Their only concern was that when asked to buy cakes for someone's birthday, she came back with \u00a3100-worth of hand-made tarts, paid for out of her own pocket. (In a similar act of generosity, Zellweger instantly won over the Bridget Jones film crew by ordering \u00a3400-worth of pizza.) 'She really helped me because I was short-staffed. It wasn't just me doing whoever a favour,' insists Camilla Elworthy, head of publicity and the only one in on the secret. Indeed, Zellweger was so helpful that one of the senior publishers asked if Ms Cavendish would be interested in a full-time job. 'I only had to take one person into my confidence,' says Elworthy. 'Somebody who I kept hearing saying to people, \"Doesn't Bridget look like that actress from Jerry Maguire .\" I said, \"That's because she is the girl from Jerry Maguire . Now please be quiet!\"' Though colleagues often wondered where Zellweger disappeared to at lunch-times (she was either meeting her voice coach or stuffing herself with pizza in a bid to put on a stone in weight for the role), and men were swatted away by Elworthy when their attentions became too amorous, no one else on the Picador staff twigged that Zellweger was an American, let alone a Hollywood star. And the cruel irony of the exercise? Part of the trainee's job was to go through the daily papers each morning, cutting out articles that pertained to any of Picador's books. There were, Bridget Cavendish found, many vitriolic tirades against an oddly named American actress, an 'unknown Texan comic'. 'Yeah, yeaaaaah,' she winces. 'I had to cut them out and file them as part of my job. I couldn't avoid it.' Zellweger smiles again. Next spring, when she comes back to do publicity, the British public will get their chance to determine whether she's pulled it off. 'We'll see, I guess, won't we?' she chuckles. 'If I'm lynched and hanging off Tower Bridge, we'll see...' \u0095 Nurse Betty opens on 1 September, and Me, Myself &amp; Irene on 22 September",

Bicentennial Man, Patch Adams and Jakob the Liar were terrible. The damage limitation has started already. The proposed film has been touted as a free-wheeling biopic similar to The People vs Larry Flynt, fusing irreverent humour with dollops of pathos. But as Flynt, Woody Harrelson wasn't afraid to be downright offensive, although admittedly the movie skipped some of the pornographer's more unsavoury stunts. Don't expect that from Uncle Robin.

The combination of the most shameless actor in Hollywood as the legendary self-publicist promises an orgy of overacting. Williams has been bearable in certain comedies, mawkish in drama, and as for camp, didn't you see The Birdcage ? The sight of Williams in garish pantomime suits, dripping with gold lam\u00e9, furs and affectations is enough to make Sir Elton John weep. Just think of the physical gags he could do around a rainbow-splattered grand piano. By his own standards, Williams's acting has been poor recently. Bicentennial Man, Patch Adams and Jakob the Liar were terrible. The damage limitation has started already. The proposed film has been touted as a free-wheeling biopic similar to The People vs Larry Flynt, fusing irreverent humour with dollops of pathos. But as Flynt, Woody Harrelson wasn't afraid to be downright offensive, although admittedly the movie skipped some of the pornographer's more unsavoury stunts. Don't expect that from Uncle Robin. Encouragingly, Philip Kaufman (The Unbearable Lightness of Being, The Right Stuff) will direct. Still, this is a Robin Williams film and it won't be complete unless there is a scene in which he makes an orphan laugh or does a high-speed impression of Richard Nixon. So audiences know what they will be getting from Liberace: The Movie. But apart from $15 million and a colourful new wardrobe what's in it for Williams. An Oscar? Stranger things have happened.",

      "body": "<p>The Irish novelist Colm To\u00edb\u00edn, soon to embark on a year's fellowship at the New York Public Library's Centre for Scholars and Writers, is a very lucky guy. I should know. I am one of the inaugural Fellows who will shortly - and most reluctantly - be making way for To\u00edb\u00edn and his colleagues in the sleek new \u00a312 million facility overlooking Fifth Avenue, fast establishing itself as a brave new force in New York's intellectual life. </p> <p>For a writer like myself, unattached to any academic institution, the opportunity to research full-time in so fertile a vineyard, and be paid for the privilege, is such stuff as impossible dreams are made of. The NYPL's Centre is the kind of literary Xanadu that does not exist in Britain, whose Iron Chancellor has yet to wake up to the blessings of tax-deductible private philanthropy - described by the library's president, Paul LeClerc, as 'the perfect embodiment of the principles of the Enlightenment'. </p> <p>Will the day ever come when anyone can walk in off the street to consult a book in the British Library, built by the taxpayers' billions - as do more than two million people a year from all over the world at the New York Public Library? Like the inscription over the fireplace in the its Trustees Room - 'The City of New York has erected this building for the free use of all the people' - the Centre for Scholars and Writers is, in microcosm, what this great democracy is all about. Small wonder British visitors invariably ask for an application form before heading home. </p> <p>Which I, for one, won't be. When I arrived in New York 12 months ago, the proud if startled bearer of a scholar's visa, I thought I had come for a year researching my next biography. By the time I returned briefly to the UK in November, for publication of my life of Shakespeare, I knew that I was already sliding helplessly back into the love affair with America I began 20 years ago as The Observer 's Washington-based US editor. By the time I popped back to Britain in January, to judge the Whitbread awards (and inadvertently spark a national nervous breakdown over the relative literary merits of Seamus Heaney and Harry Potter), I was editing my life into a skip after selling the family home. </p> <p>That old, familiar feeling had returned with a vengeance: that I was far more comfortable in the UK as an occasional, affectionate visitor than an increasingly reluctant subject of the Crown. Every time I crossed the Atlantic, whether for book tours, poker tournaments in Las Vegas or summer vacations at Cape Cod, I felt so much more at home. Ten years ago I even married the US in the luminous shape of the novelist Cindy Blake, an adopted Londoner these 22 years yet still an all-American girl at heart. Together we always planned, once our five children were grown, to lead a transatlantic life, its centre of gravity gradually shifting west towards the country we both call home. </p> <p>It's not just that Britain, viewed from a real democracy, more than ever exudes its lethal combination of self-satisfaction and backward thinking: still dithering xenophobically about Europe (for me, its only hope of any future as even a wannabe world power); keeping 92 hereditary peers, for pity's sake, not to mention that pantomime horse of a monarchy; blowing a billion pounds' worth of schools and hospitals on that hollow, doomed, vainglorious Dome; grumbling nationalistically about immigrants when they are the pulsating lifeblood of my adopted homeland, its raison d' tre . No, for me, it's also that the intellectual, cultural and literary life of the Eastern seaboard is (like the language) more alive, more alert, much feistier than the primping and preening of London's cosy circle of back-patting glitterati. Viewed from here after a month back in Britain, the old country seems more than ever like some overgrown, nose-in-air, single-sex Pall Mall club, whose pettifogging rules it is so rejuvenating to escape. </p> <p>New York City thrives on change; it can't wait to pull down buildings, for instance, to erect even more thrilling ones. Hence - along with its throbbing masses of new arrivals, each community making contributions from the cultural to the culinary - the unique vitality of the place. There is no undue reverence for the past, or indeed the present, for its own sake. </p> <p>The very essence of Britain, by contrast, is and has always been a profound resistance to change, especially change for the inspiring sake of change. Yet fundamental change is, I believe, what Britain sorely needs. Tony Blair appears to grasp this, while mysteriously failing to do much about it. To spend July in London was to be reminded almost surreally that politicians in Britain have abandoned policy for packaging. Here is a Government elected with a huge majority that is far more concerned with being liked - and so re-elected - than putting its mandate into action. Politicians of true conviction go out there and implement their manifesto, braving the consequences. This lot - and I speak as one of who rejoiced in their election - have mired politics in the era of the permanent campaign. </p> <p>I hold these truths to be self-evident. As long as Britain retains a hereditary head of state, an oligarchic government formed in the name of that monarch rather than the electorate, an established but irrelevant Church, not to mention such class-drenched fripperies as an honours system adding antique handles to lists of autopilot names, it cannot truly call itself a popular democracy. As long as its people remain subjects rather than citizens, with no written rights and no Supreme Court to adjudicate them, it is not a country in which any self-respecting democrat can comfortably hang his or her hat. </p> <p>Like his Government, Blair is Her Majesty's Prime Minister, not ours; we are defended by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, not our own; it is illegal even to post a letter without a stamp bearing the monarch's head. 'You can tell a lot about a country,' as William Cobbett put it, 'which refers to the Royal Mint and the national debt.' Or, as John Updike more recently mused in the New Yorker : 'Without their crowns and coronets, how could the English be distinguished from the Icelanders?' </p> <p>As The Observer argued recently, the monarchy promotes 'privilege over people, chance over endeavour'. This culture of 'being something rather than doing something' filters right down to the cult of celebrity which sees Britain's irredeemably philistine middle class protesting about arts subsidies while worshipping what Bryan Appleyard has aptly called 'a succession of vacant bimbos and talentless hoodlums'. </p> <p>Even more distasteful, and far more retrograde, is the pervasive reluctance to acknowledge that Britannia no longer rules the waves - that insular, Last Night of the Proms mentality which clings to dreams of empire so long after its death. Having linked this to football hooligans abroad in a recent article here, I was gratified to see the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, take up the theme the next day. Hooliganism and racism, he said, were 'largely caused by English people with a distorted view of their own nationality', still carrying 'the baggage of empire' and thus 'distorting' what it means to be English. </p> <p>Right on. After the rank, enseamed sweat of English racism, how sweet it is to breathe the air of a nation based on the simple, pure intent of seeing if all the peoples of the world can live and work together, side by side, in mutually supportive harmony. It is surely the greatest experiment in the history of mankind; it has worked stunningly well for two increasingly prosperous centuries; and it is a privilege to tag along - to be so welcomed by Liberty's open arms, another refugee from bigotry and hypocrisy, humbug and cant, if not (like so many) dictatorship and repression. </p> <p>No, I am not blind to America's running sores: the aching gap between rich and poor; the failure to tackle gun control and political funding; the excesses of political correctness and religious fundamentalism; a taste for latter-day imperialism and sanctimonious witch-hunts, from the political to the sexual (the latter brilliantly savaged in Philip Roth's new novel, The Human Stain). But all, in their way, are by-products of the quest for individual freedom, and all are constantly under address. </p> <p>Equally unwelcome, for me, is the return of capital punishment on a truly reckless scale. But this, too, is a by-product of genuine, grassroots democracy. The same would be true in Britain if any government were rash enough to hold a referendum on the issue. The US, as Jonathan Freedland has so powerfully argued in his book Bring Home the Revolution, is a country run from the bottom up rather than the top down - a nation founded on expatriate English notions of civic rights and responsibilities, imported by Brits on the run from an unelected monarchy two centuries and more ago. </p> <p>To some extent, I confess, my departure amounts to a forlorn confession of failure. For more than 20 years, since I was first pilloried for challenging the monarchy before it became voguish, I have banged my head against the status quo's all too solid brick wall in a vain quest for constitutional reform - campaigning via lobby groups such as Charter 88, helping launch new ones like Common Sense . But even the simplest notions - that the head of state should take an oath of allegiance to the people, rather than the other way around - still elude Blighty's supposedly proud sense of fair play. </p> <p>So now, with Coriolanus, I am mustering the arrogance to banish you. I prefer to walk a city whose streets are numbered, rather than named, not just for practical reasons but to avoid any divisive hierarchy of personality. Streets which are now, moreover, safer than London's, thanks to the draconian (but undeniably effective) methods of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Manhattan is so compact I can walk everywhere, which is good for my waistline, and enjoy a feast of music and art (if not always theatre) as fine as even London has to offer. I can savour a restaurant boom which does not masquerade, as in Britain, as some sort of cultural revolution. And I can venture forth into a country the size of a continent, filled with fascinating mini-countries, each with its own distinctive character. </p> <p>Capping the joys of my vita nuova is its headquarters, a 48th-floor apartment I call A View with a Room. From my tiny balcony, on a clear day (most), I can see way beyond the Hudson to the Catskills and across the East River beyond JFK airport, from a central vantage point majestically framed by the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. Five hundred feet beneath me, day and night, throbs the most dynamic city on earth. </p> <p>So what will I miss, apart from some treasured friends (most of whom pass through New York regularly, anyway)? I already have three regular Manhattan poker schools to compensate for the loss of my 30-year-old seat in London's Tuesday Game (where I am still welcome, as I was last month, to make cameo appearances). And my beloved Arsenal are available here both on cable TV and at the Gooners' New York headquarters, McCormack's Bar on 3rd Ave - where, with my sports-mad wife and son, Joe, an editor on Tina Brown's Talk magazine, I suffered in May as they lost the Uefa Cup Final. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, concluding my last US column for The Observer before heading back to the Britain, I wrote: 'From a country alive to its future, back to one which seems able only to take a decaying satisfaction in its past.' </p> <p>Two decades on, for all Blair and his semi-works, I see little reason to change a word. As I said during the Potter furore, Britain is a nation which seems to derive a perverse pleasure from refusing to grow up and take itself seriously. The result, viewed from the not-so-new world, is a glorified theme park of a nation, Europe's constitutional Disneyland (where most of the rides, alas, do not work). </p> <p>You may well choose, after hearing me out, to bid this particular emigrant 'Good riddance'. But please don't sink to quoting at me, yet again, those hoary old words of Dr Johnson: 'A man who is tired of London is tired of life.' I can only point out that the old boy never got the chance to visit the United States, let alone New York City.</p> <p><strong>Brits who love the US</strong></p> <p><strong> Salman Rushdie</strong> Moved to Manhattan with his girlfriend, former model Padma Lakshmi, earlier this year.

As long as Britain retains a hereditary head of state, an oligarchic government formed in the name of that monarch rather than the electorate, an established but irrelevant Church, not to mention such class-drenched fripperies as an honours system adding antique handles to lists of autopilot names, it cannot truly call itself a popular democracy. As long as its people remain subjects rather than citizens, with no written rights and no Supreme Court to adjudicate them, it is not a country in which any self-respecting democrat can comfortably hang his or her hat. Like his Government, Blair is Her Majesty's Prime Minister, not ours; we are defended by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force, not our own; it is illegal even to post a letter without a stamp bearing the monarch's head. 'You can tell a lot about a country,' as William Cobbett put it, 'which refers to the Royal Mint and the national debt.' Or, as John Updike more recently mused in the New Yorker : 'Without their crowns and coronets, how could the English be distinguished from the Icelanders?' As The Observer argued recently, the monarchy promotes 'privilege over people, chance over endeavour'. This culture of 'being something rather than doing something' filters right down to the cult of celebrity which sees Britain's irredeemably philistine middle class protesting about arts subsidies while worshipping what Bryan Appleyard has aptly called 'a succession of vacant bimbos and talentless hoodlums'. Even more distasteful, and far more retrograde, is the pervasive reluctance to acknowledge that Britannia no longer rules the waves - that insular, Last Night of the Proms mentality which clings to dreams of empire so long after its death. Having linked this to football hooligans abroad in a recent article here, I was gratified to see the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, take up the theme the next day. Hooliganism and racism, he said, were 'largely caused by English people with a distorted view of their own nationality', still carrying 'the baggage of empire' and thus 'distorting' what it means to be English. Right on. After the rank, enseamed sweat of English racism, how sweet it is to breathe the air of a nation based on the simple, pure intent of seeing if all the peoples of the world can live and work together, side by side, in mutually supportive harmony. It is surely the greatest experiment in the history of mankind; it has worked stunningly well for two increasingly prosperous centuries; and it is a privilege to tag along - to be so welcomed by Liberty's open arms, another refugee from bigotry and hypocrisy, humbug and cant, if not (like so many) dictatorship and repression. No, I am not blind to America's running sores: the aching gap between rich and poor; the failure to tackle gun control and political funding; the excesses of political correctness and religious fundamentalism; a taste for latter-day imperialism and sanctimonious witch-hunts, from the political to the sexual (the latter brilliantly savaged in Philip Roth's new novel, The Human Stain). But all, in their way, are by-products of the quest for individual freedom, and all are constantly under address. Equally unwelcome, for me, is the return of capital punishment on a truly reckless scale. But this, too, is a by-product of genuine, grassroots democracy. The same would be true in Britain if any government were rash enough to hold a referendum on the issue. The US, as Jonathan Freedland has so powerfully argued in his book Bring Home the Revolution, is a country run from the bottom up rather than the top down - a nation founded on expatriate English notions of civic rights and responsibilities, imported by Brits on the run from an unelected monarchy two centuries and more ago. To some extent, I confess, my departure amounts to a forlorn confession of failure. For more than 20 years, since I was first pilloried for challenging the monarchy before it became voguish, I have banged my head against the status quo's all too solid brick wall in a vain quest for constitutional reform - campaigning via lobby groups such as Charter 88, helping launch new ones like Common Sense . But even the simplest notions - that the head of state should take an oath of allegiance to the people, rather than the other way around - still elude Blighty's supposedly proud sense of fair play. So now, with Coriolanus, I am mustering the arrogance to banish you. I prefer to walk a city whose streets are numbered, rather than named, not just for practical reasons but to avoid any divisive hierarchy of personality. Streets which are now, moreover, safer than London's, thanks to the draconian (but undeniably effective) methods of Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Manhattan is so compact I can walk everywhere, which is good for my waistline, and enjoy a feast of music and art (if not always theatre) as fine as even London has to offer. I can savour a restaurant boom which does not masquerade, as in Britain, as some sort of cultural revolution. And I can venture forth into a country the size of a continent, filled with fascinating mini-countries, each with its own distinctive character. Capping the joys of my vita nuova is its headquarters, a 48th-floor apartment I call A View with a Room. From my tiny balcony, on a clear day (most), I can see way beyond the Hudson to the Catskills and across the East River beyond JFK airport, from a central vantage point majestically framed by the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings. Five hundred feet beneath me, day and night, throbs the most dynamic city on earth. So what will I miss, apart from some treasured friends (most of whom pass through New York regularly, anyway)? I already have three regular Manhattan poker schools to compensate for the loss of my 30-year-old seat in London's Tuesday Game (where I am still welcome, as I was last month, to make cameo appearances). And my beloved Arsenal are available here both on cable TV and at the Gooners' New York headquarters, McCormack's Bar on 3rd Ave - where, with my sports-mad wife and son, Joe, an editor on Tina Brown's Talk magazine, I suffered in May as they lost the Uefa Cup Final. Twenty years ago, concluding my last US column for The Observer before heading back to the Britain, I wrote: 'From a country alive to its future, back to one which seems able only to take a decaying satisfaction in its past.' Two decades on, for all Blair and his semi-works, I see little reason to change a word. As I said during the Potter furore, Britain is a nation which seems to derive a perverse pleasure from refusing to grow up and take itself seriously. The result, viewed from the not-so-new world, is a glorified theme park of a nation, Europe's constitutional Disneyland (where most of the rides, alas, do not work). You may well choose, after hearing me out, to bid this particular emigrant 'Good riddance'. But please don't sink to quoting at me, yet again, those hoary old words of Dr Johnson: 'A man who is tired of London is tired of life.' I can only point out that the old boy never got the chance to visit the United States, let alone New York City. Brits who love the US Salman Rushdie Moved to Manhattan with his girlfriend, former model Padma Lakshmi, earlier this year. New Yorkers were apparently less than welcoming: 'We don't want to die because of his fatwa,' complained one literary agent. 'It's so passive-aggressive toward people in Manhattan.'

Who derives enrichment or recognition from the paintings and drawings in half a dozen media? Arguably, the last Wyndham Lewis hour was that of his retrospective at the Tate in the summer of 1956, the year before the artist and writer's death. What successor has he had, with the single exception of that other splendidly gifted outsider, Michael Ayrton?</p> <p>It is this condition of eclipse which, manifestly, incenses Paul Edwards. He bears witness to a sense of scandalous injustice. Wyndham Lewis the artist, novelist, social critic, pamphleteer, must be restored to his high place in the pantheon of English arts and letters. </p> <p>This quest (the quixotic is generously in order) has engendered an awesome monograph. It is awesome in its dimensions, in the floodtide of scholarly detail, in its tone of relentless advocacy.</p> <p>Yale University Press has produced a resplendent tome. Though the type is very small, the layout is inspired and the 332 illustrations are of extraordinary quality. They leap off the page as Lewis purposed. The 'select bibliography' is appropriately monumental. The sheer weight of the work makes for awkward handling, but this again is apposite to its subject and polemic voice. A coffee-table volume would be wholly inappropriate; something stronger, more bitter is called for.</p> <p>Edwards analyses, minutely, the aesthetic and intellectual background. What he justly identifies as a most unusual fusion of philosophy and satire, of aesthetic ideology and journalistic mockery, had tangled roots. These comprised cubism and futurism, the vitalist psychology of Bergson and the tactical 'primitivism' of Picasso, but also a lineage of anger in British letters which includes medieval 'flyting', as well as the ironies of Swift and of Hazlitt.</p> <p>From the outset, moreover, Wyndham Lewis strove to break through both as painter and novelist, as literary adviser and graphic virtuoso. It was not till the summer of 1914, with the publication of Blast, that the concept of vorticism, in which Ezra Pound's role was seminal, achieved definition. </p> <p>It may be, even beyond Edwards's inferences, that the founding text was Shakespeare's Timon of Athens. Like Marx and Karl Kraus, fellow adepts at anger and haters of the bourgeoisie, Lewis prized this erratic block in the canon. He felt kinship with Timon's assault on human greed and hypocrisy, with the inspired loathing of Timon's solitude. The portfolio of abstract evocations of the play (1912-1913) is among Lewis's finest works. The fury is made colder by the unyielding stricture of the lines. </p> <p>Having experienced fitful but exposed action in the First World War, Lewis returned to the shredded bohemia of London. He was now convinced that European civilisation was, as Pound put it, 'a bitch gone rotten in the teeth'. Almost single-handed, Lewis set out to expound a blueprint for renascence. Steiner and Nietzsche, the purities of egotism and the dream of a new man inspired his raging critique and proposals. From The Apes of God to Self-Condemned 30 years later, there followed an outpouring of programmatic fictions, satires, political-cultural tracts and pamphlets.</p> <p>Edwards examines these with often ecstatic care. Thus Enemy of the Stars 'was probably the most comprehensively self-reflexive text produced in English since Tristram Shandy... it is impressively successful'. Time and Western Man, which is commented upon as if it were Aquinas or Hume, turns out to be 'one of the great books of the twentieth century'. The Childermass, with its allegory of true modernism, was left incomplete - 'an appropriately Michelangelesque note on which to conclude this analysis'.</p> <p>As a matter of fact, most of this material borders on the illegible. There are sparkling passages, mordant sarcasms. Often, Wyndham Lewis achieves a distinct level of hectoring energy. Overall, however, the books and tracts are moribund. Edwards's hype makes this more evident.</p> <p>Even his cult of Wyndham Lewis is severely tested by certain publications during the Thirties. Hitler appeared in 1931; The Jews: Are they Human? in 1939. Edwards's embarrassed apologies are no doubt valid in so far as Lewis's brand of 'proto-Nazism' was idiosyncratic and utopian.</p> <p>Much in these and other pronouncements is muddled crankiness. 'The Hitlerist dream is full of an imminent classical serenity - leisure and abundance.' An Arcadia marred, hitherto by the wretched Jews. Behind 'this ill-judged populist rhetoric', pleads Edwards, lies a 'desperate sincerity'. No doubt. But, to echo Ren\u00e9 Char's great maxim: 'It is not given to everyone to be midnight.' In C\u00e9line's loathsome views, in Pound's, the context of formal genius is undeniable. Not in Wyndham Lewis.</p> <p>Lewis the painter and draughtsman is another matter. A number of his portraits are classics of incisiveness. His hieratic portrayal of Edith Sitwell remains definitive; there is a wonderful, gently ironic perception in the representations of T.S. Eliot; the drawings and canvases which have Ezra Pound for their subject are generous in their penetration.</p> <p>Lewis's drawing of Rebecca West, the Portrait of the Artist's Wife (now at Kelvingrove), the relatively early seated figure of Edwin Eaves or the Smiling Gentleman of 1939 will, surely endure. As may some of the depictions, at once apocalyptic and down-to-earth, of Canadian gun-pits and batteries first drawn in July-August 1917. And there is a magic of bucolic forgiveness in the pen and ink sketches and water-colours of bathing women which Lewis produced during his long absence from England in the Forties. </p> <p>In the art also, however, there are problems. Nothing or almost nothing seems to have evolved. The harsh linearity, the tricks of semi-abstraction in faces and figures, the cubist angles are constant from the start. What ripens? Edwards's phrase, a 'cryptic immaturity' applies to far more than Lewis's early literary products. It is in play throughout. Are we dealing, as Edwards claims, with a willed concentration on the 'imperfections of life' and the saturation of modern existence by the mechanical? Or, rather with a clenched lack of humanity as insidious in the art as it is in the writings? There is a betraying myopia in Lewis's condescensions towards the thronging humanity of Joyce's Ulysses.</p> <p>A shorter, critically balanced study would have done more to advance this controversial cause. None the less, Edwards's impassioned industry and the splendour of the illustrations command respect.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer Paul Edwards Yale \u00a340, pp583 Buy it at BOL Who, today, reads Wyndham Lewis? Who derives enrichment or recognition from the paintings and drawings in half a dozen media? Arguably, the last Wyndham Lewis hour was that of his retrospective at the Tate in the summer of 1956, the year before the artist and writer's death. What successor has he had, with the single exception of that other splendidly gifted outsider, Michael Ayrton? It is this condition of eclipse which, manifestly, incenses Paul Edwards. He bears witness to a sense of scandalous injustice. Wyndham Lewis the artist, novelist, social critic, pamphleteer, must be restored to his high place in the pantheon of English arts and letters. This quest (the quixotic is generously in order) has engendered an awesome monograph. It is awesome in its dimensions, in the floodtide of scholarly detail, in its tone of relentless advocacy. Yale University Press has produced a resplendent tome. Though the type is very small, the layout is inspired and the 332 illustrations are of extraordinary quality. They leap off the page as Lewis purposed. The 'select bibliography' is appropriately monumental. The sheer weight of the work makes for awkward handling, but this again is apposite to its subject and polemic voice. A coffee-table volume would be wholly inappropriate; something stronger, more bitter is called for. Edwards analyses, minutely, the aesthetic and intellectual background. What he justly identifies as a most unusual fusion of philosophy and satire, of aesthetic ideology and journalistic mockery, had tangled roots. These comprised cubism and futurism, the vitalist psychology of Bergson and the tactical 'primitivism' of Picasso, but also a lineage of anger in British letters which includes medieval 'flyting', as well as the ironies of Swift and of Hazlitt. From the outset, moreover, Wyndham Lewis strove to break through both as painter and novelist, as literary adviser and graphic virtuoso. It was not till the summer of 1914, with the publication of Blast, that the concept of vorticism, in which Ezra Pound's role was seminal, achieved definition. It may be, even beyond Edwards's inferences, that the founding text was Shakespeare's Timon of Athens. Like Marx and Karl Kraus, fellow adepts at anger and haters of the bourgeoisie, Lewis prized this erratic block in the canon. He felt kinship with Timon's assault on human greed and hypocrisy, with the inspired loathing of Timon's solitude. The portfolio of abstract evocations of the play (1912-1913) is among Lewis's finest works. The fury is made colder by the unyielding stricture of the lines. Having experienced fitful but exposed action in the First World War, Lewis returned to the shredded bohemia of London. He was now convinced that European civilisation was, as Pound put it, 'a bitch gone rotten in the teeth'. Almost single-handed, Lewis set out to expound a blueprint for renascence. Steiner and Nietzsche, the purities of egotism and the dream of a new man inspired his raging critique and proposals. From The Apes of God to Self-Condemned 30 years later, there followed an outpouring of programmatic fictions, satires, political-cultural tracts and pamphlets. Edwards examines these with often ecstatic care. Thus Enemy of the Stars 'was probably the most comprehensively self-reflexive text produced in English since Tristram Shandy... it is impressively successful'. Time and Western Man, which is commented upon as if it were Aquinas or Hume, turns out to be 'one of the great books of the twentieth century'. The Childermass, with its allegory of true modernism, was left incomplete - 'an appropriately Michelangelesque note on which to conclude this analysis'. As a matter of fact, most of this material borders on the illegible. There are sparkling passages, mordant sarcasms. Often, Wyndham Lewis achieves a distinct level of hectoring energy. Overall, however, the books and tracts are moribund. Edwards's hype makes this more evident. Even his cult of Wyndham Lewis is severely tested by certain publications during the Thirties. Hitler appeared in 1931; The Jews: Are they Human? in 1939. Edwards's embarrassed apologies are no doubt valid in so far as Lewis's brand of 'proto-Nazism' was idiosyncratic and utopian. Much in these and other pronouncements is muddled crankiness. 'The Hitlerist dream is full of an imminent classical serenity - leisure and abundance.' An Arcadia marred, hitherto by the wretched Jews. Behind 'this ill-judged populist rhetoric', pleads Edwards, lies a 'desperate sincerity'. No doubt. But, to echo Ren\u00e9 Char's great maxim: 'It is not given to everyone to be midnight.' In C\u00e9line's loathsome views, in Pound's, the context of formal genius is undeniable. Not in Wyndham Lewis. Lewis the painter and draughtsman is another matter. A number of his portraits are classics of incisiveness. His hieratic portrayal of Edith Sitwell remains definitive; there is a wonderful, gently ironic perception in the representations of T.S. Eliot; the drawings and canvases which have Ezra Pound for their subject are generous in their penetration. Lewis's drawing of Rebecca West, the Portrait of the Artist's Wife (now at Kelvingrove), the relatively early seated figure of Edwin Eaves or the Smiling Gentleman of 1939 will, surely endure. As may some of the depictions, at once apocalyptic and down-to-earth, of Canadian gun-pits and batteries first drawn in July-August 1917. And there is a magic of bucolic forgiveness in the pen and ink sketches and water-colours of bathing women which Lewis produced during his long absence from England in the Forties. In the art also, however, there are problems. Nothing or almost nothing seems to have evolved. The harsh linearity, the tricks of semi-abstraction in faces and figures, the cubist angles are constant from the start. What ripens? Edwards's phrase, a 'cryptic immaturity' applies to far more than Lewis's early literary products. It is in play throughout. Are we dealing, as Edwards claims, with a willed concentration on the 'imperfections of life' and the saturation of modern existence by the mechanical? Or, rather with a clenched lack of humanity as insidious in the art as it is in the writings? There is a betraying myopia in Lewis's condescensions towards the thronging humanity of Joyce's Ulysses. A shorter, critically balanced study would have done more to advance this controversial cause. None the less, Edwards's impassioned industry and the splendour of the illustrations command respect.",

Of course, he is still the Independent MP for Tatton but he promised when elected that he would only serve for one term, so he will be replaced at the next election.</p> <p>But his book reads very much like a job application - he is now addicted to being an MP and hopes some other constituency will select him. He says that he has already had a few approaches, and will decide at the end of the year. It slightly depends how fit he is.</p> <p>I must say I was shocked by how much he has aged since we used to see him reporting from the war zones on television. Even after his shooting in Sarajevo in l992, he could pass for fortysomething; now he looks his age - 62 - or more. His face is gaunt and hollow-eyed, he has an alarming tremor in his hands, and he is currently hobbling on two sticks having had a second hip replacement operation. The actual shooting, he says, had no lasting effects (though he still has a piece of shrapnel in his abdomen). But when the doctors X-rayed him they told him, 'By the way, you've got a degenerative disease of the hip,' and it started affecting him about four years ago. </p> <p>So Tatton was good timing for him - physically, he couldn't have carried on as a war reporter much longer, and mentally he was deeply at odds with John Birt's BBC. He believes that news and journalism died in the Nineties. 'Foreign news ceased to register as something there was an obligation to cover. Indeed, it risked your ratings! And if you're sitting in Bosnia, and there are important events going on and you can't get it on the air because Andrew and Fergie's divorce announcement wipes everything off - then, yes, I got out just in time. I'd been doing it for 33 years, so I'd had a long innings.' </p> <p>But the manner of his getting out was purest chance. He agreed to open a photography exhibition for his friend, Tom Stoddart, and afterwards went to dinner with Stoddart and his partner, Kate Hoey. They talked about Tatton and the idea of getting an 'anti-sleaze' candidate to stand against Neil Hamilton. Hoey asked if Bell would volunteer, and he said yes, but thought it was dinner-party chat. </p> <p>Next day, Alastair Campbell was on the phone asking about his politics. He said he didn't have any; he'd been a Young Liberal at Cambridge but had barely even voted since. Apparently this was the right answer, and a few days later he was in Tatton. It all happened so fast, he didn't even consult his then girlfriend, now wife, Fiona Goddard. Twenty four days after announcing his candidacy, he was an MP. </p> <p>He loves being an MP. 'It's very agreeable, working in this wonderful palace, with the illusion of being at the centre of things, and initials after your name. I never walk into the House of Commons without a sense of being privileged to be there - however dismayed I am by what I find once I've got there.' </p> <p>His book is by way of a protest at some of the things that dismay him. He thinks party funding is out of hand, and puts politicians in the pockets of rich donors. He believes the honours system is 'corrupt - look at Ashcroft'. He says the quality of debates is generally dire and: 'Prime Minister's Question Time is a disgrace to democracy. I get quite upset, I walk out of there quite regularly because it's so dreadful. Latterly, Tony Blair has just been acting as a chorus master, bringing in his backbenchers on cue. There has to be a better way of doing it. I don't accept the confrontational and gladiatorial nature of politics; I hate that.' </p> <p>Of course, most people standing as an anti-sleaze candidate would start by searching through their cupboards in search of potential skeletons. He claims he didn't even think of it. He had nothing to hide; he even offered to show journalists his bank statements. He said there was only one thing in his life he was ashamed of - that he had once doorstepped a relative of Princess Michael of Kent's to ask about her father's Nazi connections. I asked if that was seriously the worst thing he had ever done, and he said: 'Well, if we take out the way my first marriage ended... yes.' </p> <p>He left his first wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the mother of his two daughters, and still regrets it. But she remarried a French diplomat (she is French) and they are good friends now. He then married an American television journalist, Rebecca Sobel, but the marriage was 'a disaster', he says flatly, and only lasted four years. (A stepdaughter from that marriage bobbed up in the tabloids, saying she had been a drug addict and porn star. But it was hardly Bell's fault because she was already grown up when he married her mother.) Then he had a relationship with a German woman while he lived in Berlin, and now is married to Fiona Goddard, who at 34, is not much older than his elder daughter, Melissa, who campaigned for him in Tatton and married one of her fellow-campaigners. He also has a younger daughter, Catherine, another raving beauty who is at university in the States. </p> <p>They live in a very sweet but tiny cottage in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He says he could happily live out of two suitcases, except that he likes having his books around him - or rather his father's books. </p> <p>His father, Adrian Bell, was known as 'the sage of Suffolk' and wrote 20 books on country matters, including a minor classic called Corduroy (1930) which is still in print. He also invented the Times crossword, and compiled it all his life. However, it was his grand-father, who was news editor of the Observer under J.L Garvin, who inspired Martin Bell to become a journalist. </p> <p> He spent 30-odd years 'racketing round the war zones' with his fellow news nomads. I asked if he saw any similarities between them and MPs - alcohol and adultery are two that spring to mind. 'Yes, and insecurity,' he agrees, though actually the drunkenness in the House of Commons is less than he expected. 'Both careers attract a pretty rum bunch of people, and not altogether dissimilar people I would have to say. As a wandering reporter, the company you keep is part of the attraction - people you wouldn't normally give the time of day to become close friends. But politics also has these strange, driven characters, people who live on the edge.' He says that he knows of at least two MPs who are definitely 'in need of psychiatric care', but Matthew Parris puts the loony count much higher - seven on the Tory backbenches alone. </p> <p>So where does he fit in among all these strange, driven characters? He seems, on the face of it, a bit grey, a bit colourless. I wouldn't have thought he had any dark secrets to hide, except that he talked very oddly about how he 'survived the ordeal' of being interviewed by Anthony Clare and plotted his strategy beforehand. 'I did my homework on him - because he is a very clever chap and you have to study him as much as he studies you. But then I came charging out of my defences and attacked psychiatry in all its forms.' He added courteously that he hadn't felt the need to make any such preparation for me. </p> <p>Even his friends describe him as 'complex' and certainly there are some curious anomalies in his character. For instance, he describes himself as 'an Anglican with doubts', but used to go into the warzones cluttered with pagan fetishes - his white suit most obviously, but also Cornish piskies, silver dollars, four-leafed clovers. He talks like the quintessential pukka Englishman and quotes Chesterton and Kipling by the yard and yet he has chosen to live most of his adult life abroad. He wears his regimental tie and cufflinks and uses so many military expressions in conversation, you would think he had been a brigadier at least. But he was only a corporal in National Service; he was turned down for officer training. He says this was because he was a very shy young man, and failed his intelligence test the first time round, but then he got a first at Cambridge, which again seems odd. </p> <p>He is also very thin-skinned; he huffs like crazy at any hint of personal criticism. He particularly resents the label 'sanctimonious' which sticks to him as firmly as his white suit. I raised the question with unusual tact (I thought), asking if he had ever been accused of being sanctimonious BEFORE he became the anti-sleaze candidate? But he erupted just the same: 'Well, OK, I didn't still steal, rob, rape, so I was sanctimonious! You can't win this argument. Nor did I fiddle my expense account, which was unusual.' Would people have said he was rather priggish as a young man? 'No, they would have said I was serious. In my twenties I was very serious. For a long time I didn't have much of a life outside work. I probably worked harder at Cambridge than I should have done, but it was partly because my Dad bankrupted himself to send me to expensive schools and I really felt I had to succeed in order not to let him down. I felt I had a big debt to pay back, not only financially but morally. Now if that makes me sanctimonious, it makes me sanctimonious.' </p> <p>He is proud of what he has achieved as an MP, first and foremost 'restoring the good name of Tatton'. If he hadn't made his promise to stand down after one term, he'd be back like a shot. As it is, he hopes to find a new seat. </p> <p>'But I honestly haven't made up my mind. First of all I've got to make sure I'm fully recovered from this hip thing. I also want to see what the response is to this book, if it touches a chord. It's a question of what the public wants. I mean I get a huge mail - certainly a bigger mail than most other backbench MPs - and one of the things it's telling me is that people are tired of the name-calling of party politics. And if that were the case... I mean it's a bit inconsistent to write a book which says among other things that there should be more independents in politics, and then walk away.' </p> <p>But he knows that he will never be offered a seat as safe as Tatton, in fact he will have to do a 'reverse chicken run', moving from a safe seat to a marginal. Would he have the stomach to fight a marginal, given that it could get quite nasty? 'Well,' he agrees complacently, 'I've met some world-class intimidators in my time, it wouldn't bother me too much.' </p> <p>I'm not sure that's true; he seemed pretty intimidated by Christine Hamilton at their first encounter on Knutsford Heath. But anyway, I said, I didn't really mean that: I meant he would have to get nasty. 'No, no, that's not the way I do it. Never attack, never attack. I think that people are really tired of politicians bad-mouthing each other. You don't have to play that game. As soon as you play that game you've lost anyway - it's just part of the mud-wrestling.' </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Bell's An Accidental MP is published next month by Viking (\u00a316.99).</p>",

After a few too many sak\u00e9s one year, Ferguson - Canadian, English teacher and travel writer of considerable flair and attitude - declared his intention to follow the sakura - and the sak\u00e9 - from toe to tip of Japan, hitchhiking all the way. </p> <p> Hokkaido Highway Blues is his account of this journey. The book is long, but then so is Japan - almost 3,000 km. He starts on a semi-tropical archipelago and ends up a couple of months later in a blizzard. In the interim, he's persistently mistaken for an American (something that annoys most Canadians, but not Ferguson, whose previous publications include Why I Hate Canadians); is given a lift by a man who yells 'Cowsex!' at him over and over again; encounters Japanese gangsters, Godzilla and underwear vending-machines, revels in all the other ultra-kitsch detritus of 'J-Pop' culture; is arrested; drinks an awful lot; laments his hangovers, and generally gets to know Japan about as well as a gaijin (foreigner) could hope to.</p> <p>His reason for hitchhiking rather than taking the bullet-train is to see Japan 'not as a spectator, but as a participant'. The car, he explains, 'is an extension of the home but without any of the prescribed formalities that plague Japan. Bumming rides became its own reward, the journey its own destination.' </p> <p>What makes this book quite so appealing is Ferguson's unpredictability. Stylistically, he never sits still. One moment, he's riffing lyrically about the seascape south-east of Kyushu, the next he's deconstructing the 'cubist orgy' of a Japanese porn film; he seems capable of writing in pretty much any mode that occurs to him, and has opinions on everything. And though he's frequently and savagely ironic, he is also not afraid to declare his feelings - which means you trust both his humour and his insights. All in all an admirable pair of eyes through which to see contemporary Japan. </p> <p>A lot of the funniest episodes are due to Japanese trying to speak English (despite his declarations to the contrary, Ferguson obviously has good Japanese). The 'Cowsex!' man, it turns out, once Ferguson has unscrambled his gobbledegook, is by trade an artificial inseminator of cattle.</p> <p>In a bookshop Ferguson discovers a English-learning course called Porno! Learn English by Yourself! 'It combined two great Japanese passions: English and porn,' he notes. 'It was inspired, even if poorly executed.The content varied from archaic Victorian erotica - \"presently he guided my hand lower, to that part, in which nature and pleasure keep their stores in concert\" - to the crudely direct - \"let's do tongue-fuck\".' Other bon mots that catch his eye include 'So, you're a horny tomato' and (for the more advanced students) 'The dildo! So perfect for tonight'. </p> <p>Ferguson is apparently threatening to write his next book about the UK. Given his natural asperity, and the sideswipes he makes here about the British capacity for boredom and incapacity for eroticism, it's unlikely to be a genial, patronising saunter \u00e0 la Bill Bryson. </p> <p>Unlike the Japanese, we don't have soft drinks called Sweat, or chocolate called Colon. And unlike the famous Kodo drummers, our Royal Philharmonic percussionists don't get up before dawn and run 10 kilometres, 'near-naked even in the howling depths of winter'. Nevertheless, I have every confidence that Ferguson will find plenty to enjoy in Britain, and plenty to mock. I can't wait to hear him do so.</p>",

So in the event it was something of a relief to find Cockcroft, in his black cowboy hat, standing on the station platform at the appointed time.</p> <p>As we drove to his house in the tiny clapboard village of Canaan, he described the genesis of Luke Rhinehart's story. Cockcroft, an imposing man in his late sixties with a constant half-smile playing around his face had, he explained, been experimenting with 'dicing' for a decade or more before chance intervened and he wrote The Dice Man.</p> <p>Originally he had seen the dice as a way of breaking down some of the habitual stiffness he disliked in his own character: 'I was a shy, uptight sort of guy in my teens and early twenties, and tremendously driven to succeed, get A grades and so on, and I did not like either of those characteristics one bit...'</p> <p>He had the notion that by rolling a dice to make decisions, about what to read, where to go, how to react to people, he could bring risk into his life, which he otherwise seemed naturally indisposed toward.

His students were either so appalled or so intrigued by the idea that Cockcroft knew immediately that this was something worth writing about.</p> <p>Because, partly through dicing, he had been successful in breaking down those A-grade inclinations, however, progress on the novel was slow, and by the time he completed it he was 37, living in Majorca with his family, smoking a good deal of dope and teaching English to be hippies. It was there that, by chance, he ran into a publisher in Deya who said he would look at the book.</p> <p>Some months later when the paperback rights were sold for $50,000, Cockcroft and his family were living a dice life on a sailboat in the Mediterranean.

He first came here with his family to join a Sufi-based commune up the road, and a year later bought his current house. It has become his Walden Pond, and, in some ways he sees his work in that tradition of American writing. At least, he says: 'I share Thoreau's suspicions about society and the negative effect it can have on people.'</p> <p>Sitting out on his porch, overlooking the lake, Cockcroft explains philosophically how in the years since chance led him here, he has in some ways been a victim of the vagaries of those particular lotteries called publishing and the film industry. When The Dice Man first appeared, the movie rights were sold to Paramount and John Schlesinger was set to direct. The film never appeared however: Paramount got cold feet over Luke, a character who, though married, used the dice to act out sexual fantasies, including rape. As a result, over the years, Cockcroft has seen 15 screenplays of the book come and go, and is still working on a revised version.</p> <p>Cockcroft says he no longer has quite the messianic faith of Luke that dicing is the key to fulfilment, but he maintains the more modest position that using dice occasionally 'would have some beneficial effect for everyone. It is probable that just the act of listing six things you might do on a particular day will open up possibilities that you would never otherwise have considered.

And he still firmly holds to the position that dicing is a useful alternative to a 'therapy culture' in which we search constantly for our particular motivations, and agonise over the making the 'right' decision.</p> <p>'If you ask a human being to explain why he does something, I don't really believe that any one of us is able at all to tell. Our minds are such chaos and impulse comes and goes so fleetingly...'</p> <p>So does he still believe that by dicing anybody can still be anybody? He looks out over his pond, at the life he has found himself in. 'Well, no,' he says, and laughs.

Cockcroft sees vindication of his ideas too in chaos theory ('if I understood it'), and the voguish business philosophies which build an element of chance into corporate decision making to ensure creativity, 'thinking outside the box'. And he still firmly holds to the position that dicing is a useful alternative to a 'therapy culture' in which we search constantly for our particular motivations, and agonise over the making the 'right' decision. 'If you ask a human being to explain why he does something, I don't really believe that any one of us is able at all to tell. Our minds are such chaos and impulse comes and goes so fleetingly...' So does he still believe that by dicing anybody can still be anybody? He looks out over his pond, at the life he has found himself in. 'Well, no,' he says, and laughs. 'But anybody can still be a lot more people than they think, but then I guess that doesn't make a quite such a good proverb.'",

There seems every reason to sign on cautiously. </p> <p>It takes no more than a page or two before it becomes marvellously clear that Winterson has no future as a boffin.

And yet this novel is in no way 'state of the art'; its heels are in the past, its heart outside time.

She has never stopped trying to unriddle love: The Passion, Sexing the Cherry, Written on the Body are all romantic crusades. And Winterson's lesbian identity is essential to this: she writes with the zeal of a St George liberating a princess from the dragon's mouth.</p> <p>Indeed The PowerBook reads, more than anything, like a rescue operation. She is resolved to salvage love from everything that endangers it. But she knows - it is a refrain: 'There is no love that does not pierce the hands and feet.' The Christian overtone recalls Oscar Wilde's The Selfish Giant and although her wit is not Wildean (it is all her own), she does share his romantic, quasi-religious morbidity. She knows what lovers are up against. </p> <p>In The PowerBook, the narrator and her punter fall in love in a range of imaginary incarnations, in several different countries and periods of history. There is only one aspect to this that is irritatingly tricksy: the sustained pretence that the novel is 'interactive', that it has two authors or more. Winterson tries for audience participation, collars us directly. But her 'you and me' has an uneasy facility. This is because there can be no doubt about who is in charge. Winterson writes with evangelical assurance, vaulting ambition, total control. Sometimes the book reads like a DIY bible. She is the only one with her hands on the keyboard. </p> <p>The story starts in 1591. A young woman is about to import tulips from Turkey to Holland. She disguises herself as a boy, the tulip bulbs are convincingly stitched into her trousers. It is a lightly fanciful idea - in the virtual world, anything goes. A woman can become a man, as Winterson puts it, 'by a little horticultural grafting'.</p> <p>Then follows a wonderful scene aboard a ship on which the tulip-boy is travelling. The Islamic captain advises (while eating chicken) on the unreality of the material world and as he does so - to perfect his point - lightly tosses the chicken carcass into the waves. He says: 'You will live in this world as though it is real, until it is no longer real, and then you will know, as I do, that all your adventures and all your possessions, and all your losses, and what you have loved - this gold, this bread, the green glass sea - were things you dreamed as surely as you dreamed of buffalo and watercress.' </p> <p>The captain is a master of virtual reality before its time and there is something uplifting and moving about the lightness of his speech. At its best, the writing takes your breath away: the coquettish philosophising, the elegance and caprice, the ability to move easily between the metaphysical and the visible world - and even to crack good jokes without doing any structural damage to the story. And when the tulip boy has to instruct a princess in the erotic arts, the tulip proves surprisingly potent. Winterson gets away with murder - or should that be love? </p> <p>She writes: 'The partition between real and invented is as thin as a wall in a cheap hotel room.' And the idea that all circumstantial detail is a mirage is part of the pleasure of the book. Life in Paris is full of details that seem too vividly incidental to have been invented: the pair of Dalmatians, the buskers playing Vivaldi on the metro blocking the exits and entrances, the French waiter who flares his nostrils with 'that hotel trade mixture of servility and disgust'.</p> <p>In Capri, Winterson tells the marvellous story of a frisbee that lands on a statue of the Madonna, giving her a halo she was not bargaining for. At times, reading the novel is like being on a strange package holiday with a wonderfully unreliable guide. It comes as no surprise when, in the tradition of Thomas Hardy and John Fowles, Winterson offers alternative endings to her chimerical story. </p> <p>Jeanette Winterson is like the ancient (or not-so-ancient) mariner: she holds us with her glittering eye and, even when we doubt her, we must hear her out.

      "body": "<p>The four members of a Channel 4 television crew imprisoned in Liberia on espionage charges arrived back safely at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning after a week of threats, interrogation and learning last Wednesday that they faced trial on charges punishable by the death penalty.</p> <p>Speaking for the first time of their ordeal, the four men described conditions in the police holding cells of President Charles Taylor's Liberia, where they witnessed the torture of a youth, a near-rape and the misery of the long-term inmates.</p> <p>'The violence was extraordinary,' said cameraman Tim Lambon yesterday.</p> <p>The four journalists - Zimbabwe-born Lambon, presenter Sorious Samoura from Sierra Leone, British director David Barrie and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were granted official permission to make a documentary in Liberia, which is fast approaching the status of an international pariah because of its trade in 'blood diamonds' and its support for the rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone who routinely chop the hands off children.</p> <p>But prior approval meant nothing when the four were bundled into lorries by 20 police brandishing rifles. Samoura, who is a household name throughout West Africa and celebrated for his documentary Cry Freetown, about Sierra Leone's brutal civil war, told a Heathrow press conference: 'These men in black started beating us and pushing us out into the street in the dark. We thought that was it.'</p> <p>Barrie said it had been a moment of 'total terror, considering the number of officers there, the number of rifles there and the extent to which these guys had absolutely been hyped up'.</p> <p>Lambon added: 'There might not have been all the serious physical abuse, such as rifle butts in the back of the head, although there was some of that, it was a situation of mental terror.'</p> <p>They were taken to police holding cells. Conditions were dire: the one toilet stank, the heat was unremitting, other prisoners had to pay bribes to go to the toilet and there were constant fights. Lambon and the others were searched in an aggressive and intimidating way, and had no choice but to witness the routine barbarities of Liberia's strange version of law and order.</p> <p>'They slapped one boy, he must have been 17, against the wall so hard he must have fractured his wrist. I will never forget the sound of him howling with pain. They almost gang-raped two women, but they were saved at the last moment. And there were constant fights,' Lambon told The Observer .</p> <p>'I told the others how not to display edges, to look down, to droop your shoulders, keep out of the way, but not out of sight, to hold your elbows in, so that you have a profile that is lower than shark-shit,' he said.</p> <p>'Conditions for the other prisoners were far worse. They had to pay bribes of five Liberian dollars to go to the toilet, 20 dollars to get out of the cell.</p> <p>'Let me tell you, we met hundreds of people who today are still in those jails, whose families don't even know they are there. And they don't have a hope. If you don't have money, you don't get water and you don't get food.'</p> <p>On Tuesday night, as international pressure for their release grew, they were taken from the police cells to the feared headquarters of the National Security Agency. Here Samoura was separated from the rest of the team. He was taken into a pitch-dark solitary cell the size of a 'broom cupboard' and threatened with a knife. 'The knifeman said: \"We're going to cut out your heart and use your blood to write Cry Liberia.\" Every time anyone touched my door I thought that was the end.'</p> <p>The President had been angered by the discovery of a bidding document by the team to CNN, setting out in lurid detail the dark side of the Liberian regime. The document had been brought into Liberia by mistake, Samoura admitted.</p> <p>In London, Insight News, the production company behind the documentary, and Channel 4 journalists worked around the clock to bring pressure to bear. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, former South African President Nelson Mandela, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Bill Clinton's envoy to Africa, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, all pitched in. Obasanjo called up Taylor several times, pointing out the difference between espionage and normal journalistic practice.</p> <p>Their court appearance was a low point. The Liberian judge refused bail, and the crew had little idea of how much pressure was being generated on their behalf.</p> <p>Then things slowly started to go their way.

      "bodyText": "The four members of a Channel 4 television crew imprisoned in Liberia on espionage charges arrived back safely at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning after a week of threats, interrogation and learning last Wednesday that they faced trial on charges punishable by the death penalty. Speaking for the first time of their ordeal, the four men described conditions in the police holding cells of President Charles Taylor's Liberia, where they witnessed the torture of a youth, a near-rape and the misery of the long-term inmates. 'The violence was extraordinary,' said cameraman Tim Lambon yesterday. The four journalists - Zimbabwe-born Lambon, presenter Sorious Samoura from Sierra Leone, British director David Barrie and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were granted official permission to make a documentary in Liberia, which is fast approaching the status of an international pariah because of its trade in 'blood diamonds' and its support for the rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone who routinely chop the hands off children. But prior approval meant nothing when the four were bundled into lorries by 20 police brandishing rifles. Samoura, who is a household name throughout West Africa and celebrated for his documentary Cry Freetown, about Sierra Leone's brutal civil war, told a Heathrow press conference: 'These men in black started beating us and pushing us out into the street in the dark. We thought that was it.' Barrie said it had been a moment of 'total terror, considering the number of officers there, the number of rifles there and the extent to which these guys had absolutely been hyped up'. Lambon added: 'There might not have been all the serious physical abuse, such as rifle butts in the back of the head, although there was some of that, it was a situation of mental terror.' They were taken to police holding cells. Conditions were dire: the one toilet stank, the heat was unremitting, other prisoners had to pay bribes to go to the toilet and there were constant fights. Lambon and the others were searched in an aggressive and intimidating way, and had no choice but to witness the routine barbarities of Liberia's strange version of law and order. 'They slapped one boy, he must have been 17, against the wall so hard he must have fractured his wrist. I will never forget the sound of him howling with pain. They almost gang-raped two women, but they were saved at the last moment. And there were constant fights,' Lambon told The Observer . 'I told the others how not to display edges, to look down, to droop your shoulders, keep out of the way, but not out of sight, to hold your elbows in, so that you have a profile that is lower than shark-shit,' he said. 'Conditions for the other prisoners were far worse. They had to pay bribes of five Liberian dollars to go to the toilet, 20 dollars to get out of the cell. 'Let me tell you, we met hundreds of people who today are still in those jails, whose families don't even know they are there. And they don't have a hope. If you don't have money, you don't get water and you don't get food.' On Tuesday night, as international pressure for their release grew, they were taken from the police cells to the feared headquarters of the National Security Agency. Here Samoura was separated from the rest of the team. He was taken into a pitch-dark solitary cell the size of a 'broom cupboard' and threatened with a knife. 'The knifeman said: \"We're going to cut out your heart and use your blood to write Cry Liberia.\" Every time anyone touched my door I thought that was the end.' The President had been angered by the discovery of a bidding document by the team to CNN, setting out in lurid detail the dark side of the Liberian regime. The document had been brought into Liberia by mistake, Samoura admitted. In London, Insight News, the production company behind the documentary, and Channel 4 journalists worked around the clock to bring pressure to bear. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, former South African President Nelson Mandela, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Bill Clinton's envoy to Africa, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, all pitched in. Obasanjo called up Taylor several times, pointing out the difference between espionage and normal journalistic practice. Their court appearance was a low point. The Liberian judge refused bail, and the crew had little idea of how much pressure was being generated on their behalf. Then things slowly started to go their way. On Thursday it was announced that former world footballer of the year George Weah - who plays for Liberia - was to intercede on behalf of the four journalists. Weah has film-star status in his homeland, and the ear of his President. Meanwhile, Channel 4's lawyers came up with an apology for the bidding document with which the regime could save face. The statement issued under the journalists' names read: 'We, the four journalists currently held in Monrovia Central Prison, wish to express our unreserved apology to both His Excellency the President of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused.' Channel 4's chairman, Vanni Treves, also sent a letter of apology to Taylor, the contents of which have not been released. Looking pale and exhausted, Barrie said: 'We went there to do a job, we meant no offence. We went in there to try and understand the country.' Taylor claimed the documentary would have fuelled an 'international conspiracy' to destroy Liberia by implicating it in gun-running and diamond-smuggling. If broadcast, the allegations would have been sufficient to trigger international sanctions or military action by the US and UK against Liberia, he said.",

The letter, which has been seen by The Observer, says parts of it were sent 'to Porton Down because of the potential risk of infection'. Tissue samples of skin, liver, kidney and spleen were also sent. Mrs Mullineux said: 'I was shattered. I believed I had buried my son whole and I now have found out his brain was removed without my permission and parts of his body are now in jars at Porton Down. I remember at the time of his funeral the undertaker advising me to keep the coffin lid closed. At the time, I didn't know why, but I do now.' She added: 'When he died Andrew was a civilian and died at a civilian hospital. I want to know why a doctor at a military hospital was telling me six years later that his brain was sent to Porton Down.' McGhee, who also represents more than 120 veterans suffering from Gulf War syndrome, says he has received inquiries from several families who believe the MoD has removed organs and tissues from their relatives without their knowledge. He said: 'The Human Tissues Act requires permission from next of kin before body parts are removed, and it appears in the case of Andrew this hasn't happened. I believe there are other similar cases and we need to know what went on and why these body tissues were removed and retained.' The veterans believe their illness stems from injections they were given to help protect them against chemical gas attacks, or from radiation poisoning from depleted uranium shells used in the war. Larry Cammock, chairman of the Gulf Veterans' Association, said: 'We know of a number of cases where body parts have been removed from veterans under mysterious circumstances. What are the MoD trying to hide?' A Ministry spokesman said: 'There is absolutely no truth in the suggestion we are taking body parts of Gulf War veterans and sending them to Porton Down or anywhere else.' The allegations, which first surfaced in Esquire magazine, were a matter for the hospital, he said. But the pathologist might have confused Andrew's mother by mentioning Porton Down. Although it is best known for secret military research, the site also houses the Department of Health's Centre for Applied Microbiological Research (CAMR). Perhaps the body tissues were sent to this centre, the MoD suggested. But a CAMR official said: 'We have absolutely no record of receiving a sample from a patient of the name Mullineux. Our records are very comprehensive and I am confident we would know if we had received such samples in the time period suggested.' A spokeswoman for the Southampton hospital said: 'If anything was sent to Porton Down it's a question for the Ministry of Defence, not us.' The Government is reviewing the rules governing organ removal after the scandal at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, where it emerged that parts from the bodies of 146 children were retained without their parents' knowledge. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

Our focus remains the improvement of access to all drugs, including anti-retrovirals.</p> <p>At current prices, anti-retrovirals are beyond the reach of developing countries.

President Mbeki takes the HIV/Aids pandemic extremely seriously and campaigns vigorously to promote awareness and prevention, focusing on abstinence, safe sex and condom use. We have a five-year strategic plan focusing on key areas of prevention, education and social mobilisation, including treatment, care and support, with strategies to reduce transmission of HIV from mother to child. Our focus remains the improvement of access to all drugs, including anti-retrovirals. At current prices, anti-retrovirals are beyond the reach of developing countries. Their introduction into the health service will require substantial investment in infrastructure, training and support. We also need time to evaluate the drug Nevirapine.

We have leaned over backwards for these people, the fact that two residents are still there after a year shows that.' Angela Alderslade, a worker at another West Sussex home, Greenfield in Middleton, described the atmosphere when its closure was announced. 'Lights on into the night, bells ringing and people wanting to talk, worrying about what is going to happen to them and where are they going to go. What is going to happen to us staff? 'These people have fought in wars, they have brought up families, worked hard all their lives, and now they deserve a quiet life with people they have come to love and trust.' Three of Greenfield's residents faced a double blow - they were moved to a new home also on the closure list.",

But he is wrong to say that we are 'damned by our knowledge'. We should not be afraid to make difficult decisions about the moral desirability of any particular scientific advance, after assessing them according to knowledge, logic and evidence. Priests should have no say in it. They have a vested interest in keeping us in the dark. The more we know about how the world works, the less likely we are to believe their fairy tales. Terry Sanderson London W5 If the moral imperative in this humanist, rational age is to improve the human condition in the here and now, without reference to longer-term considerations, I, for one, welcome the more rational strategic view of the church. Why Will Hutton assumes that religious people are incapable of rational thought escapes me.

The American priest had apparently told friends he feared for his life.</p> <p>On Wednesday night he dined with the Bishop of Ngong, about 25 miles from Nairobi, and left about 7pm to drive to his parish - about 150 miles to the west.</p> <p>Next day his body was found on a country road near his pickup truck. He had been killed by a shotgun bullet which almost decapitated him. There was a live round of its ammunition in his shirt pocket. Police suspect murder and the United States ambassador has urged Kenya to accept FBI help.</p> <p>The death is the latest episode in Kenya's descent into chaos, incompetence and corruption. Once it was the hope of Africa; now there is universal disillusion.</p> <p>Kaiser, a Jesuit from Minnesota who had lived in Kenya for most of the last 36 years, had been a frequent critic of the government, notably defending victims of land disputes. He was briefly held under house arrest in 1994 after criticising two government Ministers.</p> <p>His most recent run-in was with a Kenyan Minister of State, Julius Ole Sunkuli, over allegations that the official had sexually violated a minor. On the bishop's advice she went to lawyers who pursued a case against Sunkuli.</p> <p>The Minister was charged with statutory rape in June. He has denied the charges.</p> <p>After the allegations became public, Kaiser was refused renewal of his work permit, which was granted late last year only after strong protests from the US Embassy.</p> <p>The crisis of confidence in Kenya has been fed by power shortages, inflation, water rationing, corruption and the steady slide of the currency. The President - the autocratic Daniel arap Moi - recently admitted that the country was 'facing its worst crisis'. A disastrous two-year drought has left more than three million Kenyans at risk of starvation. Thousands of pastoralists have brought their cattle to Nairobi in a desperate search for grazing.</p> <p>More than 75 per cent of the country has been hit by the drought, including areas that have not known hunger in living memory, prompting the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to launch an emergency appeal for more than \u00a350 million of food. 'We don't have enough food and we don't have enough money,' said Lindsay Davies, a WFP spokesperson. 'If we don't get help soon, we won't be asking for food, we'll be asking for intravenous drips.'</p> <p>And while drought is the main cause of the shortages, corruption and mismanagement in Kenya's once mighty agricultural sector have a lot to answer for. The previously vibrant tea and coffee sectors have been ruined by corruption, and the tourist industry, once Kenya's chief foreign exchange earner, has been destroyed by a decaying infrastructure and an increasingly violent society.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund reopened the aid pipeline this month - suspended since 1997 because of government-sponsored corruption - but the economic crisis continues to deepen. In the last six months the price of corn flour, Kenya's staple food, has increased 50 per cent. A two-kilo bag of sugar which two months ago cost 70p now fetches double that.</p> <p>Until now the government has shown itself to be a master at shirking responsibility for Kenya's woes, and the people have obliged it by suffering their lot in silence.</p> <p>But Father Kaiser was not the only cleric to speak out. Last week, at a memorial service to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of Kenya's first President and founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, President Moi had to listen to stinging criticism from the Catholic priest leading the service.</p> <p>Father Dominic Wamugunda voiced the views of many citizens when he said Kenya had declined so much since Kenyatta died that the former President would be ashamed to be associated with it. 'We pray for this country, but we must also ask questions,' said the priest.</p> <p>When Kenyatta died in 1978, Kenya enjoyed growth rates among the best in Africa, and a development programme that had the country growing faster than some of the countries which later became known as the Asian tigers.</p> <p>'To think that we were so far ahead then and so far behind now beggars belief,' said Smokin Wanjala, a corruption analyst. 'We had a lot going for us then. Now we have very little.'</p> <p>Corruption in Kenya is a story of greedy people who don't know when to stop. When strict power and water rationing was imposed three months ago, the government shrugged its shoulders and laid the blame for the crisis everywhere except at its door.</p> <p>But Kenyans blame poor management and corruption for the shortages which economists estimate will cost the country billions of shillings and countless jobs.</p> <p>Since it opened 30 years ago, Charles Waweru's electroplating company has survived all that the ailing economy can throw at it. Power rationing means that his business receives electricity only every other day. He has laid off his part-time staff and his 20 full-time employees could be next. His business - which he has nurtured for three decades - might be the final casualty. 'My business has survived through thick and thin, but this one could finish me off,' said Waweru.</p> <p>But he still supports the government and does not blame it for the dangers his business faces. 'I don't believe the opposition parties would do any better.'</p> <p>Last weekend opposition politicians organised a protest rally that ended in battles between supporters of different political factions. But the same opposition politicians who rally popular support by criticising the government 's performance recently voted themselves a huge increase in their travel allowance, taking their monthly stipend to a staggering $5,000 [ \u00a37,100] a month.</p> <p>'Who do these people think they are?' asked Dominic Ruheni, a taxi driver whose business has been strangled by the ailing economy. 'People put their faith in them and hope that they can force the government to change its ways, but all they seem capable of doing is making themselves richer while we get poorer.'</p> <p>When primary school students rioted two months ago after a classmate was killed by a speeding bus, they overturned a lorry carrying beer and drank the contents.</p> <p>'When eight-year-old children are running drunk around the streets of Nairobi when they should be in school, we see that Kenya is not just suffering economic and political decline but moral decline as well,' said the comment in one newspaper.</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting by Ian Fisher of the New York Times</p>",

After the allegations became public, Kaiser was refused renewal of his work permit, which was granted late last year only after strong protests from the US Embassy. The crisis of confidence in Kenya has been fed by power shortages, inflation, water rationing, corruption and the steady slide of the currency. The President - the autocratic Daniel arap Moi - recently admitted that the country was 'facing its worst crisis'. A disastrous two-year drought has left more than three million Kenyans at risk of starvation. Thousands of pastoralists have brought their cattle to Nairobi in a desperate search for grazing. More than 75 per cent of the country has been hit by the drought, including areas that have not known hunger in living memory, prompting the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to launch an emergency appeal for more than \u00a350 million of food. 'We don't have enough food and we don't have enough money,' said Lindsay Davies, a WFP spokesperson. 'If we don't get help soon, we won't be asking for food, we'll be asking for intravenous drips.' And while drought is the main cause of the shortages, corruption and mismanagement in Kenya's once mighty agricultural sector have a lot to answer for. The previously vibrant tea and coffee sectors have been ruined by corruption, and the tourist industry, once Kenya's chief foreign exchange earner, has been destroyed by a decaying infrastructure and an increasingly violent society. The International Monetary Fund reopened the aid pipeline this month - suspended since 1997 because of government-sponsored corruption - but the economic crisis continues to deepen. In the last six months the price of corn flour, Kenya's staple food, has increased 50 per cent. A two-kilo bag of sugar which two months ago cost 70p now fetches double that. Until now the government has shown itself to be a master at shirking responsibility for Kenya's woes, and the people have obliged it by suffering their lot in silence. But Father Kaiser was not the only cleric to speak out. Last week, at a memorial service to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of Kenya's first President and founding father, Jomo Kenyatta, President Moi had to listen to stinging criticism from the Catholic priest leading the service. Father Dominic Wamugunda voiced the views of many citizens when he said Kenya had declined so much since Kenyatta died that the former President would be ashamed to be associated with it. 'We pray for this country, but we must also ask questions,' said the priest. When Kenyatta died in 1978, Kenya enjoyed growth rates among the best in Africa, and a development programme that had the country growing faster than some of the countries which later became known as the Asian tigers. 'To think that we were so far ahead then and so far behind now beggars belief,' said Smokin Wanjala, a corruption analyst. 'We had a lot going for us then. Now we have very little.' Corruption in Kenya is a story of greedy people who don't know when to stop. When strict power and water rationing was imposed three months ago, the government shrugged its shoulders and laid the blame for the crisis everywhere except at its door. But Kenyans blame poor management and corruption for the shortages which economists estimate will cost the country billions of shillings and countless jobs. Since it opened 30 years ago, Charles Waweru's electroplating company has survived all that the ailing economy can throw at it. Power rationing means that his business receives electricity only every other day. He has laid off his part-time staff and his 20 full-time employees could be next. His business - which he has nurtured for three decades - might be the final casualty. 'My business has survived through thick and thin, but this one could finish me off,' said Waweru. But he still supports the government and does not blame it for the dangers his business faces. 'I don't believe the opposition parties would do any better.' Last weekend opposition politicians organised a protest rally that ended in battles between supporters of different political factions. But the same opposition politicians who rally popular support by criticising the government 's performance recently voted themselves a huge increase in their travel allowance, taking their monthly stipend to a staggering $5,000 [ \u00a37,100] a month. 'Who do these people think they are?' asked Dominic Ruheni, a taxi driver whose business has been strangled by the ailing economy. 'People put their faith in them and hope that they can force the government to change its ways, but all they seem capable of doing is making themselves richer while we get poorer.' When primary school students rioted two months ago after a classmate was killed by a speeding bus, they overturned a lorry carrying beer and drank the contents. 'When eight-year-old children are running drunk around the streets of Nairobi when they should be in school, we see that Kenya is not just suffering economic and political decline but moral decline as well,' said the comment in one newspaper. \u0095 Additional reporting by Ian Fisher of the New York Times",

Bourdin set up shop outside Castellane 30 years ago to preach Aumism, 'a spiritual revolution representing the ideal of unity for the evolu tion of mankind and the preservation of the golden age'. The holy city became a tourist attraction, with 7,000 visitors a year, and in 1983 the planning authority issued retroactive permits for all buildings on the site. Bourdin stuck up a few more, including the giant statue in 1990. A decade ago, Castellane, near the Gorges de Verdon, became a centre for alpine hiking, climbing and white-water rafting. It wanted to rid itself of the image as home to the mad Mandarom. In 1995, Bourdin was charged with the rape of a former disciple. Before a verdict could be given, he died of diabetes, aged 75. His dubious legacy is now being dismantled in the courts, following a campaign by the Association for the Protection of Verdon's Lakes and Mountain Sites. But not everyone is happy. 'This whole region has profited from Mandarom,' a cafe owner said. 'We've all made money out of it. Admitted, it's a hideous eyesore. But I'll miss it.'",

      "body": "<p>The Himalayas: you've seen the film, now climb the mountain! The human body can acclimatise to altitudes of up to 17,500ft. At above 26,000ft, it simply starts to shut down: remain at that height without oxygen for more than three days and you will die. This is important because the summit of Everest is at 29,028ft - about the height of a cruising airliner. A task that takes seconds with oxygen can take 20 minutes without, so oxygen is at the top of any Everest climber's shopping list, and Russia has cornered the market in lightweight titanium oxygen canisters (around \u00a350,000 for the average two-month ascent).</p> <p>Your bags are going to be bulging with climbing equipment: carbiners (\u00a35), harness (\u00a365), rope (\u00a3100 per 50m), goggles (\u00a380), climbing pick (\u00a3110), crampons (\u00a3100 a pair, plus \u00a35 for point protectors), titanium ice screws (\u00a330 each) and the ubiquitous One Sport Everest boots (\u00a3300).</p> <p>Reaching Base Camp (17,500ft) is the easy part. Take a flight to Nepal (\u00a3500), then another to Lukla. Hire a yak train and porters (\u00a35,000) and don't forget your visa ($30 for 60 days) and Everest climbing permit ($70,000 per team of seven). It can take two weeks to reach Base Camp and at least another month to acclimatise.</p> <p>You'll need a bit of a hand on the way up to the summit from sherpas, who earn about $7 per day. A ratio of one climber to one sherpa is the minimum, although a rich Canadian was recently assisted by 15. Including bonuses, a sherpa will earn about \u00a32,000 for a two- or three-month expedition: in 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary's team of sherpas were each paid 100 rupees per month.</p> <p>Radios are more useful than satellite phones.

      "bodyText": "The Himalayas: you've seen the film, now climb the mountain! The human body can acclimatise to altitudes of up to 17,500ft. At above 26,000ft, it simply starts to shut down: remain at that height without oxygen for more than three days and you will die. This is important because the summit of Everest is at 29,028ft - about the height of a cruising airliner. A task that takes seconds with oxygen can take 20 minutes without, so oxygen is at the top of any Everest climber's shopping list, and Russia has cornered the market in lightweight titanium oxygen canisters (around \u00a350,000 for the average two-month ascent). Your bags are going to be bulging with climbing equipment: carbiners (\u00a35), harness (\u00a365), rope (\u00a3100 per 50m), goggles (\u00a380), climbing pick (\u00a3110), crampons (\u00a3100 a pair, plus \u00a35 for point protectors), titanium ice screws (\u00a330 each) and the ubiquitous One Sport Everest boots (\u00a3300). Reaching Base Camp (17,500ft) is the easy part. Take a flight to Nepal (\u00a3500), then another to Lukla. Hire a yak train and porters (\u00a35,000) and don't forget your visa ($30 for 60 days) and Everest climbing permit ($70,000 per team of seven). It can take two weeks to reach Base Camp and at least another month to acclimatise. You'll need a bit of a hand on the way up to the summit from sherpas, who earn about $7 per day. A ratio of one climber to one sherpa is the minimum, although a rich Canadian was recently assisted by 15. Including bonuses, a sherpa will earn about \u00a32,000 for a two- or three-month expedition: in 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary's team of sherpas were each paid 100 rupees per month. Radios are more useful than satellite phones. However, digital cameras (\u00a3500), laptops (\u00a31,000) and websites are now de rigueur among the sophisticated Everest set. A good tip is to take four tents (\u00a3450 each) and sleeping bags (\u00a3250 each) per person and leave them at each camp for the descent. Maps are not strictly necessary since the route is signposted by footprints, rubbish, ropes and the odd dead body. In 1996, 98 people reached the summit, and 15 died (a ratio of 6.5:1).

Though it's a lovely but unassuming three-storey white villa from the outside, this extravagant 19th-century mini-palace was formerly the home of the famed celebrity hairdresser, Alexandre de Paris whose decorative flair for explosive colours with a kitsch jumble of styles has remained intact.</p> <p>If only those Van Gogh-inspired, flowery frescoed walls by the staircase could recount what they've seen and heard.

When he coiffed the Begum Aga Khan for a ball in 1946, the impressed Duchess of Windsor immediately engaged him to remain by her side for the next 30 years as her personal hairdresser.

This meant installing air-conditioning, soundproofing the bedrooms with double windows, and stripping the floor to replace it with intricate geometric mosaic tiles. It also involved finding furnishings that would 'match' the walls, since everything from Alexandre's million-franc bed and precious objets d'art from around the world were cleared out.</p> <p>Still, the Chanel Room (in homage to Coco Chanel, another of Alexandre's close friends) was too flamboyant.

It's a bit more chic.'</p> <p>A similar aesthetic decision had to be made for the hotel's suite, an immense bedroom and salon (with a walk-in closet that could easily sleep four) that used to be occupied by Alexandre's associate, the late Gerald Saldi. 'Gerald was crazy about Napoleon and anything that had to do with Empire style,' explains Rosaline Boutron, Alexandre's personal manager. 'The room was inspired by certain exhibits in Paris's Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet.' The fleur-de-lys theme still prevails, but the black-and-deep-violet walls were admittedly 'a bit funeral-like' and changed into a warm ochre.</p> <p>Fortunately, the spectacular bathrooms - an assortment of gleaming mauve, yellow, pistachio-green-and-aubergine coloured tiles, exotic birds-and-butterfly wallpaper and unusual bamboo-framed showers - needed little restoration.

      "body": "<b>Dave Hanrahan:</b> In my 22 years as a fencing coach, I never thought I'd get within spitting distance of the Olympics. <p> James first walked into my club, Cyrano, 14 years ago as an eager eight-year-old. His hand was unusually fast and I could see he had the confidence to win. A year later, I started giving him lessons in my garage in Essex, where I train my particularly good pupils. </p> <p> By day, I moonlight as a tax inspector in London, but after a quick cup of tea at home, the fencing begins. As well as two club sessions, I do three evenings in the garage, teaching for three hours at a time. It's an ordinary garage - washing machine, freezer, ladders on the wall - but we build up a tremendous atmosphere. Lessons with James are intensely competitive.

      "bodyText": "Dave Hanrahan: In my 22 years as a fencing coach, I never thought I'd get within spitting distance of the Olympics. James first walked into my club, Cyrano, 14 years ago as an eager eight-year-old. His hand was unusually fast and I could see he had the confidence to win. A year later, I started giving him lessons in my garage in Essex, where I train my particularly good pupils. By day, I moonlight as a tax inspector in London, but after a quick cup of tea at home, the fencing begins. As well as two club sessions, I do three evenings in the garage, teaching for three hours at a time. It's an ordinary garage - washing machine, freezer, ladders on the wall - but we build up a tremendous atmosphere. Lessons with James are intensely competitive.

The throat is ruled by the stomach 'meridian' (energy channel) and sometimes gets physically constricted when there's something occurring in your life which is affecting you profoundly and which you find hard to 'stomach'. The throat is also obviously linked with the ability to communicate through speech. Perhaps you have a troubling relationship issue which needs addressing and communicating about. Meantime, try this: sit straight and tilt your head back gently with jaw wide open. Once the head is fully back, close your jaw. This will produce a stretch through the muscles of the throat. Return your head to the upright position and place a hand either side of your throat and in the manner of someone rubbing their hands together, massage the muscles at the side of your throat gently but briskly for a minute or so to loosen the muscles. You might also consider visiting an Alexander Technique teacher as your posture may be in need of realignment.</p> <p>Dear Barefoot Doctor, can you suggest any techniques which I could use to break myself out of what has been diagnosed as 'post-viral fatigue syndrome'?

As with ME, cranio-sacral therapy is often surprisingly effective in mobilising your body's defences, probably because it's so gentle and unintrusive and therefore able to penetrate more easily than acupuncture. Up to 10 sessions might be necessary. Yoga is also highly effective in helping you break out of constricting physical patterns and is especially useful for getting to precise spots, like the throat, for purposes of increasing circulation.

      "body": "<p>I recently took part in a radio programme, during which two listeners rang in to tell me how tired they were. Having given up sugar in an attempt to boost their energy levels, they were now feeling even worse than before. I reassured them that they had taken a step in the right direction, then explained that it takes longer than four or five days for the body to recover from the effects of sugar withdrawal and, indeed, to benefit from any nutritional change.</p> <p>Nowadays we're far too inclined to expect our bodies to respond instantly to a dietary adjustment or pill. A more realistic view is to compare your body's components to a domino effect: if one falls, it triggers a physiological chain reaction, and it's only at the end of this that you will start to feel better. If, having altered your diet, you're not feeling stronger after a month, consult your GP in case your lethargy is being caused by an undiagnosed problem. Bear in mind, too, that some drugs count exhaustion among their side effects, including antibiotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, anti-epileptic medication and cytotoxic drugs. A few drugs, such as Azothiaprin, may cause insomnia and hence chronic tiredness. So if you think that your medication may be at the root of your tiredness, ask your doctor if a less tiring drug regime is an option.</p> <p>There could also be a simple nutritional explanation for your feeling below par. You may be: deficient in vitamins and minerals; eating too many sweet foods; consuming starchy foods at unsuitable times; eating too little protein; dehydrated; depending on too many short-term stimulants that are also long-term depressants. One of the most common causes of chronic and acute tiredness is a deficiency of certain vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins, vitamin C, iron, zinc and magnesium have the most profound effect on the body's ability to derive energy from food, and when it does not receive sufficient quantities of these, it is forced to start draining its energy reserves.</p> <p>The B vitamins are a complex group of substances, including B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (nicotinic acid), folic acid, B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cobalamin), all of which encourage the digestion of food and thus the release of latent energy. Boosting your intake of green vegetables, fish, wholegrain cereals, dried fruits - especially apricots, figs and dates - as well as milk and yogurt should give you a good supply of B vitamins. B12, however, is only found in foods of animal origin, so aim to eat 125g of fromage frais or 150g of cheddar a day, for example. Vegans probably need to take a supplement to ensure that their bodies receive a daily dose of the following: 0.7 to 1.1milligrams of B1; 1.3 to 1.8mg of B2; 15 to 21mg of B3; 1.2 to 1.4mg of B6; 1.5 micrograms of B12, and 200 to 500 micrograms of folic acid.</p> <p>Vitamin B12 relies on a carrier substance to be secreted by the stomach called intrinsic factor. Some people can lack intrinsic factor and are therefore unable to absorb B12 from foods, in which case they need regular vitamin B12 injections.</p> <p>Magnesium, a mineral which is found in wholegrain products, brown rice, green leafy vegetables, peas and sweetcorn (fantastic at this time of year) also assists your body in its quest for energy and enables you to absorb vitamin C. A deficiency of vitamin C, which is present in citrus fruits, kiwi fruits, peaches, green leafy vegetables and peppers, can prohibit the body's absorption of iron. This mineral enables the body to manufacture healthy red blood cells, which pick up oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the tissues, where it unlocks food's potential energy. So eat a good-sized portion of an iron-containing food (lean red meat, game, dark-green leafy vegetables, pulses, shellfish, tinned oily fish and dried fruits), along with five portions of vitamin C-rich fresh fruits or lightly cooked vegetables each day. An additional benefit of eating more fruit instead of sugary foods (like chocolate or biscuits, which deliver a burst of energy but ultimately undermine your stamina) is that your body will receive a dose of slow-release, energising fructose.</p> <p>Starchy foods such as pasta, potatoes, rice and bread encourage the body to produce sleep-inducing hormones, so if your lunch consists of pasta, a sandwich or a jacket potato, it could be causing your afternoon tiredness. In contrast, because protein-rich foods like cheese, fish, lean meat, eggs and pulses tend to boost energy levels, opt for a sandwich with a high protein filling. Or, if your workplace has kitchen equipment, bring some cold roast chicken, lean charcuterie, cheese, hard-boiled eggs or smoked salmon from home to team with a ready-made salad and some fruit or soup. Although it may seem to involve an inordinate amount of effort, this strategy really seems to increase energy levels. Eating something is better than nothing at all: you should start to feel stronger even if you only incorporate more protein into your diet one week and focus on fruits and vegetables the next, for example, or concentrate on eating well over a free weekend.</p> <p>Because a lack of water prevents the body from absorbing the beneficial nutrients, and hence energy, in food, try to drink 2.5 litres of water a day and limit yourself to two to three caffeine-containing drinks (be prepared for an initial lack of energy, which should disappear after a few days). And resist the urge to drink at night until you have eaten something. Drinking on an empty stomach can send your energy levels plummeting, which might mean you won't muster the strength to prepare something nutritious to eat. Many of my patients who have replaced their pre-dinner tipple with tomato juice, ginger beer or fresh fruit juice have reported that they didn't realise how much post-work energy they could have. Giving up alcohol for a few weeks reaps huge, energy-boosting rewards as well.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I recently took part in a radio programme, during which two listeners rang in to tell me how tired they were. Having given up sugar in an attempt to boost their energy levels, they were now feeling even worse than before. I reassured them that they had taken a step in the right direction, then explained that it takes longer than four or five days for the body to recover from the effects of sugar withdrawal and, indeed, to benefit from any nutritional change. Nowadays we're far too inclined to expect our bodies to respond instantly to a dietary adjustment or pill. A more realistic view is to compare your body's components to a domino effect: if one falls, it triggers a physiological chain reaction, and it's only at the end of this that you will start to feel better. If, having altered your diet, you're not feeling stronger after a month, consult your GP in case your lethargy is being caused by an undiagnosed problem. Bear in mind, too, that some drugs count exhaustion among their side effects, including antibiotics, beta blockers, antidepressants, anti-epileptic medication and cytotoxic drugs. A few drugs, such as Azothiaprin, may cause insomnia and hence chronic tiredness. So if you think that your medication may be at the root of your tiredness, ask your doctor if a less tiring drug regime is an option. There could also be a simple nutritional explanation for your feeling below par. You may be: deficient in vitamins and minerals; eating too many sweet foods; consuming starchy foods at unsuitable times; eating too little protein; dehydrated; depending on too many short-term stimulants that are also long-term depressants. One of the most common causes of chronic and acute tiredness is a deficiency of certain vitamins and minerals. The B vitamins, vitamin C, iron, zinc and magnesium have the most profound effect on the body's ability to derive energy from food, and when it does not receive sufficient quantities of these, it is forced to start draining its energy reserves. The B vitamins are a complex group of substances, including B1 (thiamin), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (nicotinic acid), folic acid, B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cobalamin), all of which encourage the digestion of food and thus the release of latent energy. Boosting your intake of green vegetables, fish, wholegrain cereals, dried fruits - especially apricots, figs and dates - as well as milk and yogurt should give you a good supply of B vitamins. B12, however, is only found in foods of animal origin, so aim to eat 125g of fromage frais or 150g of cheddar a day, for example. Vegans probably need to take a supplement to ensure that their bodies receive a daily dose of the following: 0.7 to 1.1milligrams of B1; 1.3 to 1.8mg of B2; 15 to 21mg of B3; 1.2 to 1.4mg of B6; 1.5 micrograms of B12, and 200 to 500 micrograms of folic acid. Vitamin B12 relies on a carrier substance to be secreted by the stomach called intrinsic factor. Some people can lack intrinsic factor and are therefore unable to absorb B12 from foods, in which case they need regular vitamin B12 injections. Magnesium, a mineral which is found in wholegrain products, brown rice, green leafy vegetables, peas and sweetcorn (fantastic at this time of year) also assists your body in its quest for energy and enables you to absorb vitamin C. A deficiency of vitamin C, which is present in citrus fruits, kiwi fruits, peaches, green leafy vegetables and peppers, can prohibit the body's absorption of iron. This mineral enables the body to manufacture healthy red blood cells, which pick up oxygen from the lungs and transport it to the tissues, where it unlocks food's potential energy. So eat a good-sized portion of an iron-containing food (lean red meat, game, dark-green leafy vegetables, pulses, shellfish, tinned oily fish and dried fruits), along with five portions of vitamin C-rich fresh fruits or lightly cooked vegetables each day. An additional benefit of eating more fruit instead of sugary foods (like chocolate or biscuits, which deliver a burst of energy but ultimately undermine your stamina) is that your body will receive a dose of slow-release, energising fructose. Starchy foods such as pasta, potatoes, rice and bread encourage the body to produce sleep-inducing hormones, so if your lunch consists of pasta, a sandwich or a jacket potato, it could be causing your afternoon tiredness. In contrast, because protein-rich foods like cheese, fish, lean meat, eggs and pulses tend to boost energy levels, opt for a sandwich with a high protein filling. Or, if your workplace has kitchen equipment, bring some cold roast chicken, lean charcuterie, cheese, hard-boiled eggs or smoked salmon from home to team with a ready-made salad and some fruit or soup. Although it may seem to involve an inordinate amount of effort, this strategy really seems to increase energy levels. Eating something is better than nothing at all: you should start to feel stronger even if you only incorporate more protein into your diet one week and focus on fruits and vegetables the next, for example, or concentrate on eating well over a free weekend. Because a lack of water prevents the body from absorbing the beneficial nutrients, and hence energy, in food, try to drink 2.5 litres of water a day and limit yourself to two to three caffeine-containing drinks (be prepared for an initial lack of energy, which should disappear after a few days). And resist the urge to drink at night until you have eaten something. Drinking on an empty stomach can send your energy levels plummeting, which might mean you won't muster the strength to prepare something nutritious to eat. Many of my patients who have replaced their pre-dinner tipple with tomato juice, ginger beer or fresh fruit juice have reported that they didn't realise how much post-work energy they could have. Giving up alcohol for a few weeks reaps huge, energy-boosting rewards as well.",

Just along from Issey Miyake's Pleats Please, on London's chic Brook Street, it'll be slick and modern, designed by the cutting-edge architects Soft Room. And the rails will be crammed with brightly coloured New Zealand wool, Sea Island cotton and - exclusive to the shop - a few pieces of Smedley cashmere, the company's first steps into the more luxury end of the market. The Smedley celebrity hall of fame - including Paul Weller, Tom Cruise, Robbie Williams, Guy Ritchie and the Gallagher brothers - will have a new shopping destination. This small, two-storey shop is about to become Fashion Central. </p> <p>It is the start of a new era for a company that began in 1784 at the onset of the industrial revolution. Many of its staff have been with the company for years, and many are related to each other. Moreover, the business, with an annual turnover of \u00a315m, is family owned - the president is Andrew Marsden-Smedley, the chairman is his cousin Lowry Maclean - but instead of getting bogged down by family feuds, it has a team of professional managers to maintain the quality and tradition that have made the label a household name. </p> <p>For years, Smedley has manufactured limited editions and small runs for other fashion houses. It has been a secret weapon, quietly making knitwear for such designers as Yves Saint Laurent, Margaret Howell, Paul Smith, Agn\u00e8s b, Lanvin, as well as some of British fashion's more funky names, such as Antonio Berardi and Sonja Nuttall. </p> <p>But Smedley has never been seen as directional or trend-setting. Instead, you can always rely on the brand for a perfect polo shirt, a prim crew neck or a classic cardie. Fans will spend a few pounds extra for Smedleys because they won't shrink, turn into a bobbly mess or go all misshapen; they can be thrown in the wash and come out like new. Like Levi's, Doc Martens and Kangol berets, they are made to last. Nor will they go out of fashion. But this autumn, there is a new treat in store. There's the sparkle of Lurex, a sprinkling of sequins, the sexiness of a tie-neck, twinsets cut to cling rather than drape, necklines designed to flatter rather than cover, and colours that will make your mouth water. </p> <p>It's a radical departure for the Derbyshire-based company, which is still on its original site. The new look is the result of a collaboration between the head of design, Dawne Stubbs, and the London-based stylist Sally Courtis. Designers often use magazine stylists to work on their collections, but it is only in the past 10 years or so that Smedley has used a designer at all. Before that, the business was very technically based. Courtis, previously a fashion editor at Elle , was asked to consult on a capsule collection last year. And London's most fashionable boutiques, The Cross in west London, and Browns Focus on South Molton Street, are very impressed. 'I've used consultants to advise on colour,' says Stubbs, 'but never on style and styling. The idea was to do a capsule collection which would be just a step away from the main collection, but would be the icing on the cake. It has become a test bed for new yarns, designs and surface decoration.' </p> <p>It is amazing to see the process each Smedley jumper goes through before it is packed and boxed, ready to be shipped to Japan, Italy, America, or - if it hasn't quite made it past quality control - into the factory shop to be sold at bargain prices to coachloads of Japanese tourists. Each week, some 12,000 garments leave the factory. </p> <p>The process begins with bales of New Zealand superfine Merino wool, which are combed, conditioned and put on to big reels. The yarn is so fine you can't even see it spinning through the machines. It is lubricated to stop it snapping, and then goes into the knitting department, where the sleeve and collar ribs are knitted on ancient machines that are part of the Smedley secret. Next, a team of women put each rib on to machine knitting needles, stitch by stitch. Drop one stitch and the jumper will have a run in it. From there, the jumpers start to take shape on the 70-year-old knitting machines, which are gradually being replaced by new ones from Japan. The pieces are all joined together by hand and sent downstairs into the damp, sheep-smelling bowels of the factory to be washed, pressed and steamed. After that, each jumper has a neckline cut by hand, the trim attached and hand-stitched. After a final inspection under the magnifying glass, the jumpers are pressed and folded into a bag, ready for distribution. Each one goes through 35 different processes.

      "body": "<p>Twelve years ago, I visited an alternative health practitioner with some non-specific health symptoms. I'd hardly sat down before he told me that my diet needed radical attention - I had to cut out all dairy, wheat, alcohol and caffeine, and substitute protein in the form of soya milk and tofu instead. Nowadays this kind of advice is routine, but at the time, it seemed glamorously radical: I had to trek to Clapham's one health-food shop to stock up on soya milk because Sainsbury's certainly didn't have their own brand (as they do now) and veggie/soya sausages were just a glint in Linda McCartney's eye.</p> <p>In the event, I lost a stack of weight and felt immensely rejuvenated. So much so that, four months later, I started eating normally again. Just as well, because it has now been found that soya - far from having the magical, health-giving properties that the alternative medicine brigade endlessly bangs on about - can actually be bad for you. Its reputation as an anti-cancer, cholesterol-lowering, osteoporosis-fighting, low-fat all round good egg of a product is based on bad science and superlative marketing by the powerful soya industry.</p> <p>Worldwide, the evidence is starting to stack up against soya. In this country, MAFF is so worried about the possible health problems of phytoestrogens in soya that they are funding a rolling programme of 19 separate research projects, due to end in 2002. Preliminary findings by Professor John Ashby of AstraZeneca Central Toxicology Laboratory in Macclesfield, for example, confirm that soya infant formula (currently the sole food of 6,500 British babies) has an oestrogenic effect on rats. According to public health minister Yvette Cooper, no new advice will be given on soya until the independent COT (Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment) has reviewed the programme's findings.</p> <p>This could take several years. Meanwhile, if you've been seduced by the message that soya is the healthy 21st-century superfood, read on...</p> <p><b> Is soya bad for you?</b></p> <p> It contains high quantities of various toxic chemicals, which cannot be fully destroyed even by the long cooking process. These are: phytates, which block the body's uptake of minerals; enzyme inhibitors, which hinder protein digestion; and haemaggluttin, which causes red blood cells to clump together and inhibits oxygen take-up and growth. Most controversially of all, soya contains high levels of the phytoestrogens (also known as isoflavones) genistein and daidzein, which mimic and sometimes block the hormone oestrogen.</p> <p><b> Surely, the Japanese eat huge quantities of soya, and as a result have low rates of breast, uterus, colon and prostate cancers?</b></p> <p> That's the big myth on which the idea of 'healthy' soya is built. In fact, the Japanese don't eat that much soya: a 1998 study showed that a Japanese man typically eats about 8g (2 tsp) a day, nothing like the 220g (8oz) that a Westerner could put away by eating a big chunk of tofu and two glasses of soya milk. Secondly, although Japanese people may have lower rates of reproductive cancers, this is thought to be due to other dietary and lifestyle factors: they eat less fatty meat, more fish and vegetables and fewer tinned or processed foods than in a typical Western diet. Thirdly, Asians have much higher rates of thyroid and digestive cancers, including cancer of the stomach, pancreas, liver and oesophagus.</p> <p><b> I'm vegetarian and eat loads of tofu and soya milk. Should I stop?</b></p> <p> Soya has become vegetarians' meat and milk, the major source of protein in their diet. But eating soya actually puts vegetarians at severe risk of mineral deficiencies, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and especially zinc. According to Dr Mike Fitzpatrick, a New Zealand biochemist who runs a soya information website (see below), this is because soya contains high levels of phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of essential minerals in the digestive tract. To reduce the effects of a high-phytate diet, you need to eat, as the Japanese do, lots of meat or fish with tiny bits of soya.</p> <p><b> I'm intolerant to cow's milk, so should I drink soya milk instead?</b></p> <p> Soya has become the fashionable option for people 'intolerant' to dairy products. It's little known that soya is the second most common allergen. Only 1 per cent of the population is truly allergic to cows' milk and, of those, two-thirds will also be intolerant to soya milk. In addition, soya milk is high in aluminium. That's because the soya protein isolate it's made from is acid-washed in aluminium tanks. No wonder it tastes bad.</p> <p><b> Can soya affect your thyroid?</b></p> <p> It's been known for years that phytoestrogens in soya depress thyroid function. In Japan, 1991 research showed that 30g of soya a day results in a huge increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone. This can cause goitre, hypothyroidism, and auto-immune thyroid disease.</p> <p><b> I'm pregnant. Should I avoid soya?</b></p> <p> Probably, and especially if you're vegetarian. A new study of babies born to vegetarian mothers showed that baby boys had a five-fold risk of hypospadias, a birth defect of the penis. The researchers suggest this was due to greater exposure to phytoestrogen rich-foods, especially soya. Inappropriate hormone levels such as that caused by a high intake of soya during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy can also cause damage to the foetus's developing brain.</p> <p><b> But surely I can feed my baby soya formula? It must be safe: it's available in every supermarket and chemist.</b></p> <p> Soya-fed babies are taking part in 'a large, uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human infant experiment', said Daniel Sheehan, director of the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, in 1998. A newborn baby's sole food is the milk it drinks: a soya-fed baby receives the equivalent of five birth control pills' worth of oestrogen every day, according to Mike Fitzpatrick. These babies' isoflavone levels were found to be from 13,000 to 22,000 times higher than in non-soya fed infants.</p> <p>As a result of this phytoestrogen overload, soya-fed babies have a two-fold risk of developing thyroid abnormalities including goitre and auto-immune thyroiditis. Boys risk retarded physical maturation, while girls risk early puberty (1 per cent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three) and fertility. Researchers have also suggested that diabetes, changes in the central nervous system, extreme emotional behaviour, asthma, immune system problems, pituitary insufficiency and IBS may be caused by high phytoestrogen intake in early life. Last year, compounds in soya were also implicated in the development of infantile leukaemia. Current government advice is that breast is best and that soya formula should not be given to infants unless on the advice of a health professional.</p> <p><b> Can soya help with prostate cancer?</b></p> <p> Ex-junk bond trader Michael Milken certainly thinks so. He consumes 40g of soya protein every day with that hope in mind. The science is less conclusive - a recent study on Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii showed that men who had eaten two or more servings of tofu a week during mid-life not only had 'accelerated brain ageing', and more than twice the incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia, but also looked five years older than those men who didn't.</p> <p><b> My mother died of breast cancer and I've been advised by both mainstream and complementary medical sources that increasing my soya intake may offer me protection against the disease. Is this true?</b></p> <p> The evidence is highly inconclusive. In The Breast Cancer Protection Diet , published last year, Dr Bob Arnot states that eating between 35g and 60g of soya protein daily protects against breast cancer by raising intake of the oestrogen-blocker genistein. But this ignores contrary evidence. In 1996, research showed that women eating soya had an increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia, a condition that presages malignancy. In 1997, genistein in the diet was also found to stimulate human breast cells to enter the cell cycle. As a result, the researchers advised women not to eat soya products to prevent breast cancer.</p> <p><b> But surely soya prevents osteoporosis, the bone thinning that particularly affects post-menopausal women?</b></p> <p> No. In fact, soya blocks calcium and causes a deficiency of vitamin D, both of which are needed for strong bones, say American nutritionists and soya debunkers Sally Fallon and Mary G Enig.</p> <p><b> Is there any kind of soya product I can safely eat?</b></p> <p> Yes. Fermented soya products, such as soy sauce, tempeh and miso. The long fermentation process counteracts the effects of natural toxins in soya.</p> <p><b> Can I avoid soya?</b></p> <p> It's hard. You can stop eating the obvious candidates such as soya milk and tofu, but soya is also to be found in breakfast cereals, ice cream, convenience food such as hamburgers, fish fingers and lasagne, and all manner of baked goods from cakes and biscuits to tortillas and bread. If that's your mission in life, read labels carefully, and eat organic processed foods wherever possible.</p> <p><b> Finally, the pro-soya lobby always says that, in the US, a quarter of the population has been fed infant soya formula for 30 to 40 years, with no adverse health problems. So why should I worry?</b></p> <p> Scientists are only just beginning to research and understand the harmful long-term effects that eating large quantities of soya can have on the human body. As Fallon and Enig write: 'The industry has know for years that soya contains many toxins. At first they told the public that the toxins were removed by processing. Then they claimed that these substances were beneficial.' Sounds like there's a big battle ahead.</p> <p>\u0095 For further information, contact <a href=\"http://www.soyonlineservice.co.nz\" target=\"_NEW\">www.soyonlineservice.co.nz</a>, a detailed information resource on soya run by biochemist Dr Mike Fitzpatrick.

      "bodyText": "Twelve years ago, I visited an alternative health practitioner with some non-specific health symptoms. I'd hardly sat down before he told me that my diet needed radical attention - I had to cut out all dairy, wheat, alcohol and caffeine, and substitute protein in the form of soya milk and tofu instead. Nowadays this kind of advice is routine, but at the time, it seemed glamorously radical: I had to trek to Clapham's one health-food shop to stock up on soya milk because Sainsbury's certainly didn't have their own brand (as they do now) and veggie/soya sausages were just a glint in Linda McCartney's eye. In the event, I lost a stack of weight and felt immensely rejuvenated. So much so that, four months later, I started eating normally again. Just as well, because it has now been found that soya - far from having the magical, health-giving properties that the alternative medicine brigade endlessly bangs on about - can actually be bad for you. Its reputation as an anti-cancer, cholesterol-lowering, osteoporosis-fighting, low-fat all round good egg of a product is based on bad science and superlative marketing by the powerful soya industry. Worldwide, the evidence is starting to stack up against soya. In this country, MAFF is so worried about the possible health problems of phytoestrogens in soya that they are funding a rolling programme of 19 separate research projects, due to end in 2002. Preliminary findings by Professor John Ashby of AstraZeneca Central Toxicology Laboratory in Macclesfield, for example, confirm that soya infant formula (currently the sole food of 6,500 British babies) has an oestrogenic effect on rats. According to public health minister Yvette Cooper, no new advice will be given on soya until the independent COT (Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment) has reviewed the programme's findings. This could take several years. Meanwhile, if you've been seduced by the message that soya is the healthy 21st-century superfood, read on... Is soya bad for you? It contains high quantities of various toxic chemicals, which cannot be fully destroyed even by the long cooking process. These are: phytates, which block the body's uptake of minerals; enzyme inhibitors, which hinder protein digestion; and haemaggluttin, which causes red blood cells to clump together and inhibits oxygen take-up and growth. Most controversially of all, soya contains high levels of the phytoestrogens (also known as isoflavones) genistein and daidzein, which mimic and sometimes block the hormone oestrogen. Surely, the Japanese eat huge quantities of soya, and as a result have low rates of breast, uterus, colon and prostate cancers? That's the big myth on which the idea of 'healthy' soya is built. In fact, the Japanese don't eat that much soya: a 1998 study showed that a Japanese man typically eats about 8g (2 tsp) a day, nothing like the 220g (8oz) that a Westerner could put away by eating a big chunk of tofu and two glasses of soya milk. Secondly, although Japanese people may have lower rates of reproductive cancers, this is thought to be due to other dietary and lifestyle factors: they eat less fatty meat, more fish and vegetables and fewer tinned or processed foods than in a typical Western diet. Thirdly, Asians have much higher rates of thyroid and digestive cancers, including cancer of the stomach, pancreas, liver and oesophagus. I'm vegetarian and eat loads of tofu and soya milk. Should I stop? Soya has become vegetarians' meat and milk, the major source of protein in their diet. But eating soya actually puts vegetarians at severe risk of mineral deficiencies, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium and especially zinc. According to Dr Mike Fitzpatrick, a New Zealand biochemist who runs a soya information website (see below), this is because soya contains high levels of phytic acid, which blocks the absorption of essential minerals in the digestive tract. To reduce the effects of a high-phytate diet, you need to eat, as the Japanese do, lots of meat or fish with tiny bits of soya. I'm intolerant to cow's milk, so should I drink soya milk instead? Soya has become the fashionable option for people 'intolerant' to dairy products. It's little known that soya is the second most common allergen. Only 1 per cent of the population is truly allergic to cows' milk and, of those, two-thirds will also be intolerant to soya milk. In addition, soya milk is high in aluminium. That's because the soya protein isolate it's made from is acid-washed in aluminium tanks. No wonder it tastes bad. Can soya affect your thyroid? It's been known for years that phytoestrogens in soya depress thyroid function. In Japan, 1991 research showed that 30g of soya a day results in a huge increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone. This can cause goitre, hypothyroidism, and auto-immune thyroid disease. I'm pregnant. Should I avoid soya? Probably, and especially if you're vegetarian. A new study of babies born to vegetarian mothers showed that baby boys had a five-fold risk of hypospadias, a birth defect of the penis. The researchers suggest this was due to greater exposure to phytoestrogen rich-foods, especially soya. Inappropriate hormone levels such as that caused by a high intake of soya during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy can also cause damage to the foetus's developing brain. But surely I can feed my baby soya formula? It must be safe: it's available in every supermarket and chemist. Soya-fed babies are taking part in 'a large, uncontrolled and basically unmonitored human infant experiment', said Daniel Sheehan, director of the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research, in 1998. A newborn baby's sole food is the milk it drinks: a soya-fed baby receives the equivalent of five birth control pills' worth of oestrogen every day, according to Mike Fitzpatrick. These babies' isoflavone levels were found to be from 13,000 to 22,000 times higher than in non-soya fed infants. As a result of this phytoestrogen overload, soya-fed babies have a two-fold risk of developing thyroid abnormalities including goitre and auto-immune thyroiditis. Boys risk retarded physical maturation, while girls risk early puberty (1 per cent of girls now show signs of puberty, such as breast development or pubic hair, before the age of three) and fertility. Researchers have also suggested that diabetes, changes in the central nervous system, extreme emotional behaviour, asthma, immune system problems, pituitary insufficiency and IBS may be caused by high phytoestrogen intake in early life. Last year, compounds in soya were also implicated in the development of infantile leukaemia. Current government advice is that breast is best and that soya formula should not be given to infants unless on the advice of a health professional. Can soya help with prostate cancer? Ex-junk bond trader Michael Milken certainly thinks so. He consumes 40g of soya protein every day with that hope in mind. The science is less conclusive - a recent study on Japanese-Americans living in Hawaii showed that men who had eaten two or more servings of tofu a week during mid-life not only had 'accelerated brain ageing', and more than twice the incidence of Alzheimer's and dementia, but also looked five years older than those men who didn't. My mother died of breast cancer and I've been advised by both mainstream and complementary medical sources that increasing my soya intake may offer me protection against the disease. Is this true? The evidence is highly inconclusive. In The Breast Cancer Protection Diet , published last year, Dr Bob Arnot states that eating between 35g and 60g of soya protein daily protects against breast cancer by raising intake of the oestrogen-blocker genistein. But this ignores contrary evidence. In 1996, research showed that women eating soya had an increased incidence of epithelial hyperplasia, a condition that presages malignancy. In 1997, genistein in the diet was also found to stimulate human breast cells to enter the cell cycle. As a result, the researchers advised women not to eat soya products to prevent breast cancer. But surely soya prevents osteoporosis, the bone thinning that particularly affects post-menopausal women? No. In fact, soya blocks calcium and causes a deficiency of vitamin D, both of which are needed for strong bones, say American nutritionists and soya debunkers Sally Fallon and Mary G Enig. Is there any kind of soya product I can safely eat? Yes. Fermented soya products, such as soy sauce, tempeh and miso. The long fermentation process counteracts the effects of natural toxins in soya. Can I avoid soya? It's hard. You can stop eating the obvious candidates such as soya milk and tofu, but soya is also to be found in breakfast cereals, ice cream, convenience food such as hamburgers, fish fingers and lasagne, and all manner of baked goods from cakes and biscuits to tortillas and bread. If that's your mission in life, read labels carefully, and eat organic processed foods wherever possible. Finally, the pro-soya lobby always says that, in the US, a quarter of the population has been fed infant soya formula for 30 to 40 years, with no adverse health problems. So why should I worry? Scientists are only just beginning to research and understand the harmful long-term effects that eating large quantities of soya can have on the human body. As Fallon and Enig write: 'The industry has know for years that soya contains many toxins. At first they told the public that the toxins were removed by processing. Then they claimed that these substances were beneficial.' Sounds like there's a big battle ahead. \u0095 For further information, contact www.soyonlineservice.co.nz, a detailed information resource on soya run by biochemist Dr Mike Fitzpatrick.

Well, these guys have the skill to haul that baby on down the road.' </p> <p>Mrs O Neale, president of the Lady Truckers' Club of Great Britain, has spent 20 years hauling these 44-tonne babies down the road. She uses language like this because she is a dyed-in-the-wool, embossed-on-the-mudflap trucker, and all truckers speak like country and western lyricists. She is worth talking to about customised trucks because while she is all effusive and poetical, the men who do the customising are rather shy about discussing it with outsiders. </p> <p>We are sitting amid rig and wagon at Truckfest Scotland, on the Royal Highland Showground just outside Edinburgh. Like the other three Truckfests (Peterborough, Shepton Mallett, Driffield) that convene each summer, it is a two-day festival for people who work with, or who just happen to like, trucks - a head-on collision between the Glastonbury Festival and Convoy. Driver teams from haulage companies and individual owner-drivers come with their families to park up, pitch tents, polish chrome and talk trucker-talk around the barbie. Judges (there are 10 competitons) wander and ponder. Manufacturers come to show off their new models. Ex-drivers and fans haul their families down avenues of exhibits, fairground sideshows and stalls selling scale models, T-shirts and piles of trucking-themed country and western CDs. And then there are the stars of the show, standing tall and imperious like prize bulls: the customised 'units' lovingly sprayed with airbrush artwork, smoothed with spoiler and aerofoil, and bejewelled with airhorn, spotlight-bar and aerial shrubbery. </p> <p>Most of the custom trucks are owned by private-haulage firms, and have been decorated at the instigation of the owners. Specialist paint shops do the spraying (a cab unit takes about two weeks and costs, on average, \u00a33,000), and workshops or the drivers themselves will add the accessories. Usually, European owners take their themes from films, music or television, choosing one or more recognisable characters - the Highlanders and Bravehearts at Truckfest Scotland, for example. In the US, truckers tend to favour flames, sunsets and eagles. </p> <p>The most recognisable individual here is the 'Queen of Hearts', technically a DAF 95XF tractor unit but also a 10-wheeled, 12ft, blue-and-silver monument to Princess Di, created by Roy Gill of RD Gill Haulage in Derbyshire. Diana's famous eyes and teeth gleam on the bonnet and side panels; on the back of its cab, Elton John gazes mournfully at the legend 'Goodbye Englands Rose'. If you've driven down the M6, you might have seen it; if you haven't, it will probably take your power of speech away at the first sight. </p> <p>Why Di? Well, Roy has a truck painted with a different motif every year. 'Queen of Hearts' was his wife Sarah's idea (he 'took some persuading') in 1997. Other models, also on show today, include 'Legend of Rock', 'Comedy Classic' and, most recently, the Winnie-the-Pooh-themed 'Bear Essentials' - a present for his six-year-old daughter, Melissa. Like a lot of the customisers here, he is dead blokey and jokey, until I start asking him serious-ish questions about the artwork. Then he talks a bit about the business justifications - the enhanced profile, the possibilities for merchandising and toys - before handing me over to Sarah. Does she think her husband really gets the trucks painted because they bring more business in? Not really, she says. 'But you know, Roy's trucks are his life, and his hobby, as well as his work.' </p> <p>Stephen Wilson, who runs a Braveheart Scania out of Peterhead, says the public response made it worth the money ('It is unbelievable... factories come to a standstill when you pick up from them, and one woman chased me through London in her car, to get a picture'). Andy Scott, who has an International Harvester recovery vehicle and who painted several of the trucks here at his South Yorkshire paint shop, thinks it is sometimes about advertising, sometimes about self-expression ('I did a portrait of a dog that had died for one fella. When he saw it the tears were welling up in his eyes. That was worth more than the money to me'). </p> <p>Bob Limming, whose company Live Promotions runs Truckfest, reckons it's about the driver's sense of vocation: 'We started Truckfest in 1983 because our managing director's brother, a driver, had observed that lorry drivers were turning into truck drivers. It was changing from a dirty old job that anyone could do into one that you needed skills for. When you're driving 40 tonnes of truck and you think about those cold rainy nights on your own [cue steel guitar], it feels like you've got quite a responsibility. So it became a vocation. This had already happened in the US, and there was an influence from films like Smokey and the Bandit, which were about drivers who were macho, but who also had vehicles that were their own and that looked good.' </p> <p>This might sound a little fanciful to urban sophisticates, but less so, I think, to those who grew up in the sort of villages that most of the men and women at Truckfest come from. Because however much living in the countryside teaches you to appreciate nature, it teaches you to appreciate machines with wheels much more. Public transport being what it isn't, they are what allow you meet people, go shopping and make your life more about you than it would be otherwise. </p> <p>And then there's the work side. There's always lots of big stuff to be moved in the country - bales of straw, tons of coal, piles of logs. It's hard work, and the people responsible for it come to love the machines that make it easier. This love of engines and strong vehicles is in the country air. If you go into rural areas, you find thousands of men who are quietly besotted with fast cars, Land Rovers, tractors and odd-shaped motor vehicles from dragsters to industrial cranes. In most of these blokes, the desire to dress up and show off has been submerged by rugged common sense; in the custom truckers of Great Britain, it has resurfaced.</p>",

Other projects have included the Valentino store on London's Sloane Street, Patrick Cox, Moschino and the refurbishment of Richard James, Savile Row's coolest tailor. In Kent's business, appearances are everything. Two years ago, when he moved into the streamlined 1937 apartment block designed by Wells Coates, the architect who built London's famous Lawn Road Flats in Belsize Park, he decided to take advantage of the underground car park. He bought his dream car: a silver 1971 Mercedes 280SEL. It was a fantasy on wheels; the ultimate pose. </p> <p>For Kent, along with thousands of others who shudder at the thought of driving some bland, modern box of a car made by Ford or Toyota, his car is an extension of his personality. Just as he would rather have his fingernails slowly plucked out one by one than be seen wearing a shell suit or a C&amp;A anorak, so too is it vital that when he gets behind the wheel of a car, it is not something he would consider naff or clich\u00e9d. As far as Kent is concerned, you are what you drive. When a car ceases to be a machine that gets you from A to B, and instead becomes a fashion accessory, its owners are identifying themselves with a particular style tribe, just as they might if they shaved their hair and wore DMs or adopted a uniform of rugby shirt and deck shoes. In Kent's case, the tribe happens to be a very select one. His is not any old Mercedes. Only 900 of his particular model were ever built. He is not a member of the car club, preferring to go it alone with his silver dream machine - a mark of his impeccable taste and style. </p> <p>For others, it might be a Morris Minor that gets the pistons going. Or an MG or a Mini Cooper. Certain types of people gravitate towards certain cars. It is no surprise that the man driving the 1991 Nissan Figaro, a round-bottomed, smiley-faced, retro-styled car that you might be forgiven for thinking came out of Italy circa 1959, is wearing a T-shirt that reads 'Art is a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it'. Mick Brownfield is an illustrator. At his Richmond home, he keeps a collection of tin toys in a display case. It is important to him that his car is well-designed, characterful, and functional, too. The Figaro - a car that looks old but has none of the problems of rickety carburettors, patches of rust or condensation on the windows - fits the bill perfectly. And on the rare occasion he passes another Figaro on the road, he blinks his lights and you'd swear they winked at each other. </p> <p>In the case of Deborah Davis, it really is a lifestyle thing. Dressed in pair of vintage Lee denim dungarees, kitsch flip-flops and pigtails, she is every bit the 50s rockabilly chick. She works at the vintage clothing shop Blackout II, in Covent Garden, and is as excited about a new shipment of box-fresh 50s shoes from America as she is about her two-tone yellow-and-cream 1957 Nash Metropolitan. She and her boyfriend have a stall selling 40s and 50s clothing at weekends at various car rallies and events. It wouldn't really be quite the same if she pulled up in a Ford Fiesta. </p> <p>While a car can be a fashion accessory, it can also be a way of life. The most hardcore and impenetrable of car style tribes is that of the hot rods. They start them young, too. Children of hot rodders pedal about in miniature versions of their parents' cars. They're known as Hot Tots. The whole point here seems to be to make your car the lowest, baddest, meanest, widest, and kitschest possible. At hot rod rallies, you can buy car stickers that read 'Satan' and 'This is not an abandoned vehicle'. Cars are sawn, chopped, repainted, pin-striped and customised beyond all legal limits. These are the punk anarchists of the car world. </p> <p>Dean Micetich, the grease-haired guitarist in the psycho-surf band Magnum 500, and a fashion and textiles student at Central Saint Martin's, couldn't imagine life any other way. His hand-painted black hot rod, built from parts shipped over from America, is, in his own words, 'a heap of shit'. It doesn't have any glass in it - no windscreen, no windows. It doesn't even have a roof. And the gear stick is topped off with the head of a Tiki god. Micetich has grown up with 50s cars and music. He's living the life; the car he drives is as important as the air he breathes. And the air reeks of petrol.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ridin' along in my automobile <br> My baby beside me at the wheel <br> I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile <br> My curiosity runnin' wild <br> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <br> With no particular place to go </p> <p> C 'mon everybody. Sex, fast cars and rock'n'roll. What else do you want, that is you, me and Chuck Berry? The mortgage? Forget that. What else? Pension fund. Yeah yeah. A weekend cottage in Smartshire. Not listening. A Volvo estate. Zzzz... Let's face it, the upbeat images on these pages of hep-cats and rock stars a-cruisin'n'a-playin' hicksville country somewhere between the Rockies and the Appalachians in a time forever 1957 - give or take 10 years- are as far removed from the lifestyle of Sunday-supplement-reading British middle classes as Waco is from Welwyn Garden City. </p> <p>And yet, there must have been one inter-stice on the school run where you've imagined yourself in a '55 Corvette or a '57 Belair or any big-finned, chrome-laden Cadillac? Snicking the Hurst into top and fusing the loud pedal to the floor, unleashing the horses from a Hemi-headed 350-incher and racing in the street. Stopping for a pre-McDondald's burger at, say, the 66 Diner, Albuquerque. Inching past a high-rolling XK-E on Dead Man's Curve... All these images, reel and rock somewhere in the mental cul-de-sacs if not the cranial interstate freeways of anyone brought up in the age of rock'n'roll, spawned according to most but not all music authorities, in Sun Studio, 706 Union Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee one day in 1954 when the 19-year-old Elvis Presley cut 'That's Alright Mama' for Sam Phillips, the legendary producer who said, 'I never heard a car song I don't like.' </p> <p>Back in '51, Phillips had produced Jackie Brenston singing 'Rocket 88'. A homage to the brawny Oldsmobile of the same name, 'Rocket 88' was just a chromed fender short of rock'n'roll. </p> <p>The first thing Elvis did when he made it biggish was to buy a car (not an Olds or a Caddie, but a humble Ford) which he drove down to Tupelo, his Mississippi birthplace, to choff cheeseburgers and deep-fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches at Johnnie's Drive-In at 908E Main Street. When Elvis made it really BIG ('Heartbreak Hotel', number one, 1956) he bought the first of what were to be more than 100 Cadillacs (pink and white, the first one). These mobile gin-palaces changed their look every single year, sprouting ever more deliciously redundant chrome-plating and fins. Every burgeoning rock'n'roll star just had to have one and not just because this is what poor country boys who made it did - buy a big car - but it's what rock'n'roll was and still is about. Just as jazz blew to the rhythm of highballin' express trains and the blues echoed the mournful trail of freight trains whistlin' their way between the cotton-picking poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the promise of a prosperous Chicago to the far north, so rock'n'roll pounded to the insistent, skipping rhythm of, at first Fords, then Chevies and Cadillacs. </p> <p> As I was motivatin' over a hill <br> I saw Maybellene in a coupe-de-ville <br> A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road <br> Nothing will outrun my V8 Ford, <br> The Cadillac doing 'bout ninety-five <br> She's bumper-to-bumper rollin' side-by-side </p> <p>Chuck Berry again. And if his lyrics don't spell sex, cars and rock'n'roll, then none ever will. For many got-rich-quick stars, it had to be a Cadillac... for Chuck himself, Roy Orbison, Elvis, Isaac Hayes and Phil 'Wall of Sound' Spector. Rock'n'roll nearly always sounds best chattering from the speakers of a car, best of all an all-American car occupying a lot of road space. </p> <p> I'm getting bugged driving up and down the same old strip <br> I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip </p> <p>Well, the Beach Boys, whose sound was as fresh as chilled cranberry juice, liked their cars, too. Their California sound is inextricably linked with memories of coasting Sunset Boulevard in deuce-coups, whether little or 427-cubic-inch large. Brian Wilson, the genius behind the Beach Boys' inimitable summer surfing sound, says his life was changed forever one day in 1961 when as a 19-year-old he was driving his '57 Ford Fairlane around Hawthorne, his home town in California, and heard the Ronettes cooing 'Be My Baby' from the car's radio. He had to pull over to compose himself. And compose. </p> <p>You sort of expect singing stars to arrive, when they do arrive, in big American cars.

      "bodyText": "Ridin' along in my automobile My baby beside me at the wheel I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile My curiosity runnin' wild Cruisin' and playin' the radio With no particular place to go C 'mon everybody. Sex, fast cars and rock'n'roll. What else do you want, that is you, me and Chuck Berry? The mortgage? Forget that. What else? Pension fund. Yeah yeah. A weekend cottage in Smartshire. Not listening. A Volvo estate. Zzzz... Let's face it, the upbeat images on these pages of hep-cats and rock stars a-cruisin'n'a-playin' hicksville country somewhere between the Rockies and the Appalachians in a time forever 1957 - give or take 10 years- are as far removed from the lifestyle of Sunday-supplement-reading British middle classes as Waco is from Welwyn Garden City. And yet, there must have been one inter-stice on the school run where you've imagined yourself in a '55 Corvette or a '57 Belair or any big-finned, chrome-laden Cadillac? Snicking the Hurst into top and fusing the loud pedal to the floor, unleashing the horses from a Hemi-headed 350-incher and racing in the street. Stopping for a pre-McDondald's burger at, say, the 66 Diner, Albuquerque. Inching past a high-rolling XK-E on Dead Man's Curve... All these images, reel and rock somewhere in the mental cul-de-sacs if not the cranial interstate freeways of anyone brought up in the age of rock'n'roll, spawned according to most but not all music authorities, in Sun Studio, 706 Union Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee one day in 1954 when the 19-year-old Elvis Presley cut 'That's Alright Mama' for Sam Phillips, the legendary producer who said, 'I never heard a car song I don't like.' Back in '51, Phillips had produced Jackie Brenston singing 'Rocket 88'. A homage to the brawny Oldsmobile of the same name, 'Rocket 88' was just a chromed fender short of rock'n'roll. The first thing Elvis did when he made it biggish was to buy a car (not an Olds or a Caddie, but a humble Ford) which he drove down to Tupelo, his Mississippi birthplace, to choff cheeseburgers and deep-fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches at Johnnie's Drive-In at 908E Main Street. When Elvis made it really BIG ('Heartbreak Hotel', number one, 1956) he bought the first of what were to be more than 100 Cadillacs (pink and white, the first one). These mobile gin-palaces changed their look every single year, sprouting ever more deliciously redundant chrome-plating and fins. Every burgeoning rock'n'roll star just had to have one and not just because this is what poor country boys who made it did - buy a big car - but it's what rock'n'roll was and still is about. Just as jazz blew to the rhythm of highballin' express trains and the blues echoed the mournful trail of freight trains whistlin' their way between the cotton-picking poverty of the Mississippi Delta and the promise of a prosperous Chicago to the far north, so rock'n'roll pounded to the insistent, skipping rhythm of, at first Fords, then Chevies and Cadillacs. As I was motivatin' over a hill I saw Maybellene in a coupe-de-ville A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road Nothing will outrun my V8 Ford, The Cadillac doing 'bout ninety-five She's bumper-to-bumper rollin' side-by-side Chuck Berry again. And if his lyrics don't spell sex, cars and rock'n'roll, then none ever will. For many got-rich-quick stars, it had to be a Cadillac... for Chuck himself, Roy Orbison, Elvis, Isaac Hayes and Phil 'Wall of Sound' Spector. Rock'n'roll nearly always sounds best chattering from the speakers of a car, best of all an all-American car occupying a lot of road space. I'm getting bugged driving up and down the same old strip I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip Well, the Beach Boys, whose sound was as fresh as chilled cranberry juice, liked their cars, too. Their California sound is inextricably linked with memories of coasting Sunset Boulevard in deuce-coups, whether little or 427-cubic-inch large. Brian Wilson, the genius behind the Beach Boys' inimitable summer surfing sound, says his life was changed forever one day in 1961 when as a 19-year-old he was driving his '57 Ford Fairlane around Hawthorne, his home town in California, and heard the Ronettes cooing 'Be My Baby' from the car's radio. He had to pull over to compose himself. And compose. You sort of expect singing stars to arrive, when they do arrive, in big American cars. The limo stretched to the point of near undriveability, all chartreuse velveteen plush, smoked windows and unlimited booze. It's nearly always big, this Yankee car. Sure, it's easy enough to imagine Simon and Garfunkel pootling along wistfully in a VW Beetle or, tragically, Marc Bolan in the passenger seat of a Mini meeting death on Barnes Common, but for most of the rest, size counted.

      "body": "<p>It was while driving through Milton Keynes in a minicab earlier this year that I first became interested in roundabouts. As we progressed from one side of the city to another, I was aware (a) that I was spending half the journey being hurled from one side of the car to the other and (b) that my minicab driver was becoming increasingly tense. These two factors were not unrelated.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, I was watching Ken Dodd at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland. 'Coming to the theatre tonight,' he said, 'I've driven around that many roundabouts that I unscrewed the hubcaps off the wheels of me car.' There are quite a lot of roundabouts near Sunderland, as it happens, but then again there are a lot of them everywhere in this country, and I suspect that this joke of Dodd's has been told in many theatres.</p> <p>I called the Transport Research Lab in Crowthorne, Berkshire, and was put through to a roads expert called John Pierce, who told me that roundabouts are 'around about a hundred years old' (at which point I began to think he must have the damn things on the brain), and that there are more of them here and around the world than ever before, thanks to Britain's promotion of this type of junction. Mr Pierce then referred me to a book called The Design of Roundabouts, by Mike Brown.</p> <p>This is a formidable work, stuffed with sentences such as: 'The saturated capacity results of entry and circulating flow Qk and Qz were plotted and a regression line fitted giving the entry/circulating relationship, see Fig 4.3.' Much of the book is given over to mathematical formulae representing car-approach speeds, rates of deflection, etc - all of which put to shame the north of England traffic manager who frankly told me, under the protection of anonymity, that the roundabouts in his town were sometimes designed 'by drawing around the bottom of a coffee mug'. But if you persist with the book, a fascinating - or at least fairly interesting tale - emerges.</p> <p>The story of roundabouts begins with Haussmann's rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III. He introduced a number of what Mike Brown cautiously describes as 'circular places', such as the one around the Arc de Triomphe (now the Place Charles de Gaulle). These were not roundabouts in the full Milton Keynes sense of the word, because traffic moved around them in all directions in a completely chaotic manner. The idea of getting all the traffic moving in the same direction around a circular place - no great brainwave, we might think today - is credited to a Frenchman called Eugene Henard. The system was employed around the Arc de Triomphe in 1907, and developers of the English garden city of Letchworth went to see it in action, subsequently creating Britain's first roundabout, which was built at a six-road junction in Letchworth called Sollershot Circus.</p> <p>By 1925, there were gyratory systems at Parliament Square, Hyde Park Corner and Marble Arch, among others. Although all traffic moved in one direction on these, there was no requirement that you give way to the right, only a recommendation that you do so, which was regarded as patronising and un-British in its authoritarianism.</p> <p>With the growth in car numbers, however, roundabouts tended to become 'locked' - a log jam would occur wherein no one could move because of everyone else. There's a picture of a locked roundabout in Mike Brown's book, and very forlorn it looks - you can't imagine how it could become unlocked except by a crane coming along and removing a few cars. Today, of course, the photograph would include scenes of people hitting each other, but we were a more civilised nation in the 50s.</p> <p>The problem of locking led to 'give way to the right' becoming mandatory in 1966, and one can imagine the thunderous condemnation in the Daily Express - but we soon became so keen on roundabouts that the mini-roundabout was also developed for areas where space was limited. (When does a roundabout become mini, you might ask. When it's less than four metres in diameter.) In the late 60s, and 70s, the Transport Research Laboratory conducted a series of boring but important investigations into traffic flow around roundabouts, with the result that the British became the leading experts in the field, and the world's main proponents of roundabouts.</p> <p>As I look at the mini-roundabout near my house, I wonder why. There seems to be a near-miss, with accompanying swearing, every few minutes. It appears that people do not understand the 'give way to the right' rule, or, if they do understand it they don't agree with it. My north of England traffic manager admits, 'You're not really sure if people are going to give way, so you go around a roundabout quite cautiously. Somebody might pull out a bit early, you have to break, he toots his horn, you shake your fist, and everyone's happy.' If he sounds complacent, that's because roundabouts, while the source of much aggro, are by far the safest kind of junction, generating half as many accidents as traffic lights. According to John Pierce, 'If someone goes through a red light, there's going to be mayhem, but if there's a collision at a roundabout, the angle of impact means it tends to end in bent metal rather than personal injury.'</p> <p>This is the message Britain is spreading, and Mike Brown allows himself a rare lyrical moment in writing that it has caused a 'renaissance' in the European roundabout. France finally saw sense in 1983, and followed our lead by instructing drivers to give way to circulating traffic, which the rest of continental Europe had been doing for some time. In America, too, roundabouts are becoming more popular, although they're still regarded as a bit prissily English over there, and the bolder flyover remains the favoured kind of junction.</p> <p>The circular principle, which this country has done so much to pioneer and refine, is nowhere better enshrined than Milton Keynes, for it turns out that not only are there a hell of a lot of roundabouts in Milton Keynes, there are in fact more there than in any other town. 'Well_' says a press officer for the town, 'at least in terms of per head of population. We've got around 300 in all, including mini-roundabouts.'</p> <p>Milton Keynes was created according to what was rather sinisterly known as a 'master plan' of 1970, a key aim of which was unrestricted traffic flow. So the town was built using a grid pattern of roads, with roundabouts at the intersections. A gloomy man at a Milton Keynes tyre suppliers called Fred the Tread told me that the roundabouts of the town are 'very unpopular'. 'Can you actually screw your hubcaps off by driving around them?' I wondered, mindful of Ken Dodd. 'No,' he said, 'but they do wear your tyres out on the inside.' Well, surely that's good for you, I suggested. 'Suppose so,' he said, but he didn't sound very pleased. Dave Lawson, senior engineer with Milton Keynes council, countered this by saying that in his experience the roundabouts of the town were 'not unpopular', adding, 'If you drive around the appropriate carriageways at the correct speed, tyre wear is not an issue.'</p> <p>He told me that the major roundabouts in the town had been given names to give them a 'sense of place', I asked him to give me an example of a name, and he said, 'I can't think of any right now.' The first roundabout that I saw on re-visiting Milton Keynes was called Kingston Roundabout. There was a big sign announcing this, alongside another reading 'DSV Samson Transport', for this roundabout, like many others in the town, is sponsored by a local business.</p> <p>Kingston Roundabout was heavily wooded and quite pretty, but as I passed Marina Roundabout, Hospital Roundabout and Bleak Hall Roundabout - which is named after somewhere nice that was destroyed to make way for Milton Keynes, and sponsored by somebody or something called Brian Currie - the roundabouts were beginning to get me down a bit, prefaced as they are by creepily generic signs reading 'Leisure Plaza', 'Industry', 'Shopping'. Specifically, they were making me dizzy and, as I drove off the main roads, I simply came across many smaller roundabouts. I began to think that the people of Milton Keynes must have roundabouts in their houses, roundabouts in their heads .</p> <p>Roundabouts might be a great British success story, but all in all it was a great relief to get back on the M1; I wanted to go somewhere fast - ie home - and not in a roundabout way.</p>",

'Well_' says a press officer for the town, 'at least in terms of per head of population. We've got around 300 in all, including mini-roundabouts.' Milton Keynes was created according to what was rather sinisterly known as a 'master plan' of 1970, a key aim of which was unrestricted traffic flow. So the town was built using a grid pattern of roads, with roundabouts at the intersections. A gloomy man at a Milton Keynes tyre suppliers called Fred the Tread told me that the roundabouts of the town are 'very unpopular'. 'Can you actually screw your hubcaps off by driving around them?' I wondered, mindful of Ken Dodd. 'No,' he said, 'but they do wear your tyres out on the inside.' Well, surely that's good for you, I suggested. 'Suppose so,' he said, but he didn't sound very pleased. Dave Lawson, senior engineer with Milton Keynes council, countered this by saying that in his experience the roundabouts of the town were 'not unpopular', adding, 'If you drive around the appropriate carriageways at the correct speed, tyre wear is not an issue.' He told me that the major roundabouts in the town had been given names to give them a 'sense of place', I asked him to give me an example of a name, and he said, 'I can't think of any right now.' The first roundabout that I saw on re-visiting Milton Keynes was called Kingston Roundabout. There was a big sign announcing this, alongside another reading 'DSV Samson Transport', for this roundabout, like many others in the town, is sponsored by a local business. Kingston Roundabout was heavily wooded and quite pretty, but as I passed Marina Roundabout, Hospital Roundabout and Bleak Hall Roundabout - which is named after somewhere nice that was destroyed to make way for Milton Keynes, and sponsored by somebody or something called Brian Currie - the roundabouts were beginning to get me down a bit, prefaced as they are by creepily generic signs reading 'Leisure Plaza', 'Industry', 'Shopping'. Specifically, they were making me dizzy and, as I drove off the main roads, I simply came across many smaller roundabouts. I began to think that the people of Milton Keynes must have roundabouts in their houses, roundabouts in their heads . Roundabouts might be a great British success story, but all in all it was a great relief to get back on the M1; I wanted to go somewhere fast - ie home - and not in a roundabout way.",

Men were feckless, irresponsible goons who could never be trusted. At best, they were idiots who would never remember to take it. At worst, they were scheming opportunists who would brazenly lie to women that they were on it just to get them into bed. But enough of what men thought - what about women? </p> <p>The female pill had its 40th anniversary recently, so it seems like a good time to assess just how far women have come in terms of controlling our fertility. A quick look at the facts would suggest not far enough. It would seem that, while the teenage pregnancy rate continues to soar, many women in their thirties are experiencing grave difficulty conceiving. Moreover, a recent study reveals that, far from being ignorant about contraception, three out of four teenage girls fall pregnant after receiving advice about contraception. Many of these girls are actually on the Pill, but keep forgetting to take it once a day, preferring their own scientific systems - say once every Brookside episode, every day with an 'r' in it, or, that old classic, three months' supply at once, desperately washed down with Vimto the morning after the night before. </p> <p>I'm not sneering at these girls - we've all been there, done that, and bought the testing kit. There can't be many women around who haven't walked the tightrope of the youthful pregnancy scare. The fact that your own somewhat abstract approach to contraception is to blame doesn't matter a fig when you get The Fear. That panicky stillness as you try to discern whether a twinge is just a twinge or a menstrual cramp. The mournful gazing at tampon dispensers: how they mock you! The surreal huddling together with friends who all solemnly promise to babysit forever and ever, but, first things first, could you lend them your lip gloss? Then, relief, euphoria, maybe a quick hushed lap of honour around the parental bathroom. All of a sudden, it seems rather funny. However, in 1998, 101,500 teenage girls weren't laughing. </p> <p>The main problem seems to be that the average 15-year-old girl never really believes she will get pregnant. Likewise, the 35-year-old woman never really believes she won't. Indeed, many women have a tendency not to believe in their fertility as a biological reality until they're forced to. Unfortunately, evolution moves slowly, and women are forever getting caught out or left behind. Our bodies haven't caught up with the new feminine penchant for post-career motherhood. Our ovaries haven't been told to remain dormant, only exploding in a kind of gynaecological firework display when we've got the career, the house, and the man in situ. On the contrary, for many women, fertility is a simple case of feast followed by famine. So it is that girls shiver in their bedrooms, contemplating motherhood or abortion, while nurseries remain empty, as shocked thirtysomethings undergo IVF to kick- start their clapped-out ovaries. </p> <p>The infertile older woman seems the worst hit by the fertility blight, simply because there's little she can do except wait, hope and spend a lot of money. However, surely a lot more could be done for young girls. Maybe we should take a leaf out of New Labour's book and try bullying them. My first feeling was that sexually active teenage girls might benefit from those twice-yearly contraception jabs - whereupon they would be forcibly 'inoculated' against pregnancy just as they are against mumps and rubella. I was quite pleased with this idea, and ready to stand for government, until a surely overexcited male colleague pointed out that this put me in the same happy ethical company as the Nazis. And so we return to the condom, which guards against STDs, and the Pill, which men can't refuse to put on. The Pill is safe these days, and said to be 99 per cent effective. The hard bit seems to be getting teenage girls to become 99 per cent effective at taking it. </p> <p>Maybe we could start by trashing the long-held assumption that young females are genetically more inclined to be responsible where contraception is concerned. I wasn't when I was a teenager. Were you? Whereas men of all ages have all but admitted that they would probably be useless at remembering to take the male pill, women never seem to put forward the 'controversial' theory that young girls might be just as daft, as hormonally addled, as young boys. But they must be. Something has to explain why, despite navigating a veritable ticker parade of Family Planning leaflets from the age of 12 onwards, young girls are still getting pregnant before their time. While it's probably true that men have proven themselves to be idiots who simply can't be trusted to take a pill every day, it might be time to accept that the female track record isn't an awful lot better.</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk\">barbara.ellen@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Eastern Energy said it was because I had changed my supplier to Norweb Energi. This is categorically not the case but Eastern said that, if Norweb had become my supplier incorrectly, Norweb was responsible for transferring me back.</p> <p>As I have not signed any gas supply contract with Norweb, I assume it cannot charge me for the gas it supplies, and presumably Eastern cannot charge me either as my contract ended with the final gas account. </p> <p>I am baffled about how my gas supplier can change without my knowledge, but, from talking to these two companies, I gained the impression that this may not be an uncommon problem.<strong> <br> SC, South Molton </strong></p> <p>Norweb confirms that erroneous transfers happen frequently. Switches from one gas provider to another take place through Transco where, if an account number is mistyped, the wrong customer is moved to a different supplier. But Norweb admits that Transco is not to blame on this occasion. Rather, its own staff typed in your meter reference number when they should have been transferring someone else, probably with the same surname. </p> <p>It then assumed you were still getting your gas from British Gas and tried to send you back there, which confused British Gas. This has all happened within the 28-day cooling-off period, so you never stopped being an Eastern customer and Eastern will charge for the gas you have used in that period. If the confusion had lasted longer and you had lost money through Norweb's mistake, the company confirms that it would make good its error. </p> <p><strong> Woolwich windfall: Perpetual problem</strong></p> <p> My Woolwich windfall shares are held within Perpetual Pep and I do not receive any communications from Woolwich.

You can ask Perpetual to send you the full takeover pack but it might charge \u00a320 plus VAT. </p> <p>Investors who kept their Woolwich shares in the Woolwich Pep will automatically receive the full offer pack. </p> <p><strong> Shares muddle: Halifax hassle</strong></p> <p>I have tried to place my wife's name on my Halifax shares so that she will inherit without hassle on my demise. I assumed this would be a simple task but Halifax sent back the transfer form asking me to fill in an exemption code and saying I should contact the Inland Revenue Stamp Office for help. I visited the Stamp Office in Newcastle but they said they were not allowed to give advice and I should not have been sent there, although they pointed out that the form had been completed incorrectly. I am now mesmerised. Please could you jolly the Halifax along?<strong> <br> BC, Whitley Bay </strong></p> <p>There must have been some misunderstanding because the Stamp Office staff are the people to advise you. </p> <p>The Halifax is sending you new forms to fill out, and the head of shareholder services says he will personally make sure the shares are transferred. You still need to find the right code but, instead of making the journey to Newcastle, telephone the Stamp Office's central helpline on local-rate number 0845 6030135.

      "bodyText": "I pay for my gas by monthly direct debit to Eastern Energy and was surprised to receive a final bill earlier this month. Eastern Energy said it was because I had changed my supplier to Norweb Energi. This is categorically not the case but Eastern said that, if Norweb had become my supplier incorrectly, Norweb was responsible for transferring me back. As I have not signed any gas supply contract with Norweb, I assume it cannot charge me for the gas it supplies, and presumably Eastern cannot charge me either as my contract ended with the final gas account. I am baffled about how my gas supplier can change without my knowledge, but, from talking to these two companies, I gained the impression that this may not be an uncommon problem. SC, South Molton Norweb confirms that erroneous transfers happen frequently. Switches from one gas provider to another take place through Transco where, if an account number is mistyped, the wrong customer is moved to a different supplier. But Norweb admits that Transco is not to blame on this occasion. Rather, its own staff typed in your meter reference number when they should have been transferring someone else, probably with the same surname. It then assumed you were still getting your gas from British Gas and tried to send you back there, which confused British Gas. This has all happened within the 28-day cooling-off period, so you never stopped being an Eastern customer and Eastern will charge for the gas you have used in that period. If the confusion had lasted longer and you had lost money through Norweb's mistake, the company confirms that it would make good its error. Woolwich windfall: Perpetual problem My Woolwich windfall shares are held within Perpetual Pep and I do not receive any communications from Woolwich. With the proposed takeover by Barclays Bank, there will soon be important documents from Woolwich to its shareholders on significant issues. I would like to receive and study all such communications to decide my options about accepting shares or cash and the like. DN, West Kilbride Shares in all Peps and Isas are held in nominee accounts, which is why you do not receive anything directly from the Woolwich. When details of the offer are known, Perpetual will send you a synopsis and, if there is a choice between cash and shares, will ask which you want. If there is no choice, it will simply send new documents. You can ask Perpetual to send you the full takeover pack but it might charge \u00a320 plus VAT. Investors who kept their Woolwich shares in the Woolwich Pep will automatically receive the full offer pack. Shares muddle: Halifax hassle I have tried to place my wife's name on my Halifax shares so that she will inherit without hassle on my demise. I assumed this would be a simple task but Halifax sent back the transfer form asking me to fill in an exemption code and saying I should contact the Inland Revenue Stamp Office for help. I visited the Stamp Office in Newcastle but they said they were not allowed to give advice and I should not have been sent there, although they pointed out that the form had been completed incorrectly. I am now mesmerised. Please could you jolly the Halifax along? BC, Whitley Bay There must have been some misunderstanding because the Stamp Office staff are the people to advise you. The Halifax is sending you new forms to fill out, and the head of shareholder services says he will personally make sure the shares are transferred. You still need to find the right code but, instead of making the journey to Newcastle, telephone the Stamp Office's central helpline on local-rate number 0845 6030135. They will run through a list of questions to find the right category. Corporate bonds: Worth the risk? My National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bonds mature in September. The rate paid now is less than I have been getting, and my inclination is to invest elsewhere. I am wary of the stock market, and want an investment that is relatively safe but which pays a better monthly income than Pensioners Bonds. Can you suggest something?

I want to buy a property, for which I will require a mortgage. As I am a German national (but resident in the UK) and already have life insurance in Germany, I am looking for a lender who will not require me to take out further life insurance in the UK. My bank, HSBC, has given me a quotation but will not recognise my German life insurance. For ethical reasons, I prefer a mutual society. AK, Aylesbury HSBC says it is confused because life insurance is not compulsory with its mortgages. Any UK resident or EU national can apply for an HSBC loan.

It was threatening legal proceedings for the non-payment of a bill. </p> <p> But to the soldiers in 2 Para in the Falklands Islands, fighting their way through Goose Green and Wireless Ridge, the letter could hardly have seemed more ridiculous. 'Friends had just been killed,' says Lukowiak, who wrote this story in his first book, A Soldier's Song , 'and we were wondering if we would get killed tomorrow. In war, you just don't have the time for bills and money. It just doesn't enter your head.' </p> <p> Lukowiak, 41, who became the partner of Sarah Macaulay, now married to Chancellor Gordon Brown, has just published his second book, Marijuana Time, which talks about the end of his army career and the time he spent in prison when convicted of having 4lb of marijuana. As with the story about the Access bill, he combines humourous writing with profound sadness. </p> <p> Marijuana Time is dedicated to the late Guardian writer Jill Tweedie 'in the name of love'. It was Tweedie and her husband Alan Brien who read the manuscript of A Soldier's Song when he was doing his post-prison day job as their painter and decorator. The Guardian published excerpts, and two days later he had offers from publishers. He has come a long way from the council estate where he was brought up. </p> <p> But he thinks his five army years may be partly responsible for him being 'terrible' with his finances. He was well-paid and pensioned and 'didn't have to think much about money'. </p> <p> 'I'm one of those chaps who has to be rationed by his girlfriend, no matter how much I earn. If you send me out with \u00a3100, I'll come back with nothing.' And there is a deeper legacy. </p> <p> 'I've always had problems looking ahead,' he says. Doing so is potentially threatening and a waste of time for a soldier risking his life in combat. Now, however, 'maybe I've got to start saving for the future'. </p> <p> With longstanding attitudes like these, however, it is not surprising that he and his friends have been astonished that his former girlfriend should have married the champion of financial prudence and saving for the future. 'To go from someone like me to Gordon Brown is kind of unbelievable,' he says. 'Friends who know me are amazed. The only thing that we've got in common is that we bite our nails.' </p> <p> Yes, one cannot imagine the Chancellor using marijuana, let alone sending it to friends by a supposedly safe route in the army mail. </p> <p> Since the end of the deeply affectionate but troubled two-year relationship with Macaulay in 1994, Lukowiak has lived away from London, now in Truro, and concentrated on writing. The two years living with her in London were 'fabulous', but he prefers the Cornish pace of life - and there, 'you need to earn a third of the money that you need in London'. </p> <p> He is now working on his third book about his trips as a journalist to Bosnia, Rwanda and Argentina. </p> <p> His life will probably never be a rags to riches story because he is unlikely to become a big convert to financial prudence. But he has escaped the bleak financial trap that threatened to stultify his creativity forever after he completed his six-month prison sentence. </p> <p> He is engaged, and plans to marry his fianc\u00e9e some time next year. Clearly, forward planning is starting to become possible. </p> <p>\u0095 Marijuana Time is published by Orion at \u00a39.99.</p>",

'Friends had just been killed,' says Lukowiak, who wrote this story in his first book, A Soldier's Song , 'and we were wondering if we would get killed tomorrow. In war, you just don't have the time for bills and money. It just doesn't enter your head.' Lukowiak, 41, who became the partner of Sarah Macaulay, now married to Chancellor Gordon Brown, has just published his second book, Marijuana Time, which talks about the end of his army career and the time he spent in prison when convicted of having 4lb of marijuana. As with the story about the Access bill, he combines humourous writing with profound sadness. Marijuana Time is dedicated to the late Guardian writer Jill Tweedie 'in the name of love'. It was Tweedie and her husband Alan Brien who read the manuscript of A Soldier's Song when he was doing his post-prison day job as their painter and decorator. The Guardian published excerpts, and two days later he had offers from publishers. He has come a long way from the council estate where he was brought up. But he thinks his five army years may be partly responsible for him being 'terrible' with his finances. He was well-paid and pensioned and 'didn't have to think much about money'. 'I'm one of those chaps who has to be rationed by his girlfriend, no matter how much I earn. If you send me out with \u00a3100, I'll come back with nothing.' And there is a deeper legacy. 'I've always had problems looking ahead,' he says. Doing so is potentially threatening and a waste of time for a soldier risking his life in combat. Now, however, 'maybe I've got to start saving for the future'. With longstanding attitudes like these, however, it is not surprising that he and his friends have been astonished that his former girlfriend should have married the champion of financial prudence and saving for the future. 'To go from someone like me to Gordon Brown is kind of unbelievable,' he says. 'Friends who know me are amazed. The only thing that we've got in common is that we bite our nails.' Yes, one cannot imagine the Chancellor using marijuana, let alone sending it to friends by a supposedly safe route in the army mail. Since the end of the deeply affectionate but troubled two-year relationship with Macaulay in 1994, Lukowiak has lived away from London, now in Truro, and concentrated on writing. The two years living with her in London were 'fabulous', but he prefers the Cornish pace of life - and there, 'you need to earn a third of the money that you need in London'. He is now working on his third book about his trips as a journalist to Bosnia, Rwanda and Argentina. His life will probably never be a rags to riches story because he is unlikely to become a big convert to financial prudence. But he has escaped the bleak financial trap that threatened to stultify his creativity forever after he completed his six-month prison sentence. He is engaged, and plans to marry his fianc\u00e9e some time next year. Clearly, forward planning is starting to become possible. \u0095 Marijuana Time is published by Orion at \u00a39.99.",

It treats Ray's own perception of the world, as well as his close but complex relationship with his brother Pete (David Morrissey), who runs a small caf\u00e9 in west London, and his loving friendship with Laura (Kelly Macdonald), a free-spirited Scottish woman, pregnant with the child of an abusive ex-boyfriend. </p> <p>This is not a case history (the actual disorder is never named), Ray's life isn't a metaphor for the human condition or anything like that, and he's not presented as saintly or possessing a superior vision. Ray is a mass of contradictions. He wants to be trusted, but acts wilfully, often irresponsibly. He knows he's ill, but rejects the regimen of drugs that will help him retain his balance, and in a terrifying gesture he grinds up his tranquillisers and bakes them into a pizza served in his brother's restaurant. </p> <p>A visual motif running through the movie is the spiral, the device through which Ray attempts to impose order on the chaotic world he experiences. It's first seen from a train as a corn circle in a field, then as a giant Catherine wheel, as a pattern drawn on a beach, and finally, when he spins out of control, as a sculpture he creates from plastic binliners in a Shepherd's Bush street. </p> <p>Craig's sad, unsentimental Ray is complemented by Morrissey's concerned, frequently exasperated brother, whose own life as hard-working caf\u00e9 owner, diligent son and rejected husband has been no bed of roses. The film's final sequence, in which the pair are reconciled as they cook an omelette together, is reminiscent of the end of Stanley Tucci's Big Night. Some Voices is accompanied by Bring Me Your Love, a short directed by Morrissey, also set in a mental hospital. This brief study in bad faith and self-deception stars Ian Hart as a journalist visiting his troubled wife. It's well worth seeing, though less impressive than Morrissey's earlier short, the historical anecdote A Secret Audience. </p> <p>Every comedian from Chaplin and Keaton through Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Bob Hope and Martin and Lewis, down to the Carry On team and Mel Brooks has made a spoof western. Now Jackie Chan, though at 46 a trifle old to respond to the injunction 'Go west, young man', has followed the trail with Shanghai Noon. It's virtually a transposition to Nevada of his last movie, Rush Hour , where he played a Hong Kong cop assisting a member of the LAPD to find the kidnapped daughter of a Chinese consul. </p> <p>Here he's Chon Wang (pronounced 'John Wayne'), a member of the Imperial Guard, lowliest member of a team sent from the Forbidden City in 1881 to rescue a Chinese princess (Lucy Liu of Ally McBeal fame) whisked away to Nevada. His first act there is to frustrate a train robbery and join forces with one of the thieves, a laidback outlaw played by Robert Red ford lookalike Owen Wilson. The ramshackle plot links a succession of carefully choreographed fights, there's a comic reprise of the finale of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , and there are patronising jokes at the expense of Native Americans of a sort we haven't heard for years. Terence Young's Red Sun (teaming Toshiro Mifune and Charles Bronson) and the TV series Kung Fu handled the idea of an Asian on the American frontier with greater dignity and more wit. The best thing about Shanghai Noon is its title. </p> <p>Exactly 40 years ago this month, Hitchcock's seminal Psycho exploded on the world, and its latest grandchild, Cherry Falls, arrives as a birthday present. It's an unpleasant creature that comes knife in hand and tongue in cheek, a version of those slasher flicks, usually starring Jamie Lee Curtis, in which revenge for some depredation of 10 or 20 years back is taken on apparently innocent teenagers, usually while they're having, or have just had, sex. </p> <p>The joke here is that the remorseless killer (a woman or a man in drag) is deliberately targeting virgins in the comically named Cherry Falls, Virginia. The principal of the local high school (who is one of the half-dozen or more suspects) fears that if word gets out 'we'll have a goddam fuck-fest on our hands'. It does, and 'we're talking hymen holocaust here' as one female pupil says, while her friends are preparing a 'Pop Your Cherry Party'. Australian filmmaker Geoffrey Wright directs as if swinging a cleaver, and a typical joke has a cop being cut in twain with an axe half-a-second after he's said: 'This is my post, I can't just split.' There are just two killings in Psycho. Cherry Falls has upwards of a dozen; I lost count. </p> <p>In Davis Guggenheim's slick, empty, dislikeable thriller, Gossip, a trio of smart undergraduates at a New York university concoct a story about two fellow students as a class exercise (they're studying the way rumours circulate). They unleash a horrific train of events in a convoluted movie in which the emphasis is on the 'con'.</p>",

The principal of the local high school (who is one of the half-dozen or more suspects) fears that if word gets out 'we'll have a goddam fuck-fest on our hands'. It does, and 'we're talking hymen holocaust here' as one female pupil says, while her friends are preparing a 'Pop Your Cherry Party'. Australian filmmaker Geoffrey Wright directs as if swinging a cleaver, and a typical joke has a cop being cut in twain with an axe half-a-second after he's said: 'This is my post, I can't just split.' There are just two killings in Psycho. Cherry Falls has upwards of a dozen; I lost count. In Davis Guggenheim's slick, empty, dislikeable thriller, Gossip, a trio of smart undergraduates at a New York university concoct a story about two fellow students as a class exercise (they're studying the way rumours circulate). They unleash a horrific train of events in a convoluted movie in which the emphasis is on the 'con'.",

The week when a television critic may be found pacing Beachy Head with specific, solitary intent, or wondering how best to affix the garden hose to the exhaust.</p> <p> This is the nadir of summer scheduling and the point when even those summer hits we loved as recently as, ooh, seven whole days ago, are suddenly dismissed with a sneer: ' Big Brother ? So the week before last - surely you're not still watching!' </p> <p>In any week other than this, spotting the name W.G. Snuffy Walden on the titles of a new show might have provoked the tiniest smile of fond recognition coupled with warm nostalgia. But this week - and this week alone - it was an event of considerable televisual magnitude. </p> <p> When the name W.G. Snuffy Walden first impinged on my consciousness it was attached to the credits of thirtysomething, back in the Eighties. At that time, W.G. was an infarction-inducing in-joke between myself and my then partner: how did anybody get to have a name like a Dick Bruna character? And if they were comfortable with revealing Snuffy in a professional capacity, what on earth could the W.G. stand for?</p> <p>As a kid I had a rabbit named J. Piers Grundy whose J just stood for J, so perhaps Snuffy Walden's W.G. stood only for W.G., though eventually I decided it should be Wily Grinder. Anyway, Wily's job is providing mournful, tinkly piano scores for the productions of Ed Zwick and Marshall Hershkovitz who became famous, via thirtysomething, as dramatic chroniclers of the middle- class suburban American Dream gone sour, though was there ever a time when it wasn't? </p> <p> I am not embarrassed to admit that, in my twenties, thirtysomething's Hope and Michael were something approaching aspirational role models (stripped wood floors, a verandah, wash-and-go hair, cute kids...) despite (though some may say because of) the fact that, as characters, they were terminally miserable and self-obsessed. When the final episode was broadcast in the early Nineties, it was one of those invite-all-your-mates-round-for-a-pizza TV moments, and though we had a great evening, oddly I can't remember the plot.</p> <p>And now it's back! Well, not thirtysomething and not Hope and Michael and their angsty chums, but a new Wily Grinder Snuffy Walden/ Zwick/ Hirshkovitz production called Once and Again . And yes, I'll repeat that - Once and Again - because you will have forgotten it already. What does it mean, precisely? </p> <p> Well, what it means is that Hope and Michael's younger siblings (in spirit, if not flesh) are now grappling with challenging new thirtysomething dilemmas. They have the same wood floors and verandahs; the sun slants fetchingly through the white shutters just as it did a decade ago; but now they've traded their marriages for divorces, rickety station wagons for shiny Jeeps, careers in advertising for ones in architecture and instead of those mewling ankle-biters on the limed oak floors there are teenage kids (an academically under-achieving drop-dead gorgeous jock; an allegedly fat, plain girl, necessarily played by a thin, pretty girl wearing a baggy T-shirt) slumped over the breakfast bar.</p> <p>This time around the Hope and Michael characters (she: a sort of Sandra Bullock by way of Carol Vorderman; he: Jim Carrey as if remodelled by Gepetto from a chunk of cheddar) are a pair of newly single parents playing the dating game: 'Mommy's really nervous. Mommy hasn't done this in a very long time. Can I have a bit of support, please!' Cue group hug. </p> <p> The show's Unique Dramatic Selling Point is a series of docusoap-style talking head inserts, filmed in black and white, in which the lead characters confess candid emotions like 'I was amazed by my body. I wanted him so much', and 'I just don't know where I fit in my own life any more'. At one point the would-be couple were serenaded by a very, very special Wily Grinder number: Inside my skin/ There is this face/ It twists and turns/ It bleeds and eeeeuuuurrrggghhh [Well, that's what it sounded like]/ Inside my heart/ there's an empty room/ It's waiting for lightning/ It's waiting for yooaaarrgghhooooowwww...</p> <p> Once and Again confuses humourless soundbite sanctimony with profundity, making thirtysomething look like Das Boot. Time, methinks, for Wily Grinder to push the Boot out by pitching for something challenging, like a Lars von Trier movie or a new theme for the Intel Pentium Processor. How the mighty are fallen, or - scary thought! - was thirtysomething also this bad all along and we just didn't notice because we were so distracted by the sun dappling on the highly polished floors? </p> <p> It turns out that Arthur Golden's bestselling novel, Memoirs of a Geisha, got it all wrong. Not that you can tell underneath all that inscrutable slap, but the geishas of Kyoto are furious because, it turns out, they're not geishas at all - they're geikos. Which is why, after considerable negotiations, they finally agreed to allow a documentary camera to strip away all the mystique and set the record straight.</p> <p>Unfortunately, once deprived of both mystique and a plot (an antique kimono being stolen by a rival geiko, say, or a bit of extra-curricular love interest with the MD of a vast widget-making conglomerate), life as a geiko turns out to be an interminable round of pouring tea and sake, bowing, playing the oriental version of Twister, laughing at the jokes made by the MDs of vast widget-making conglomerates and singing godawful songs. Hearing the young star of Geiko Girl, Mamehisa, tackle The dream of that night together/ Cannot be extinguished/ I am filled with the memory of it/ My emotions are deepening/ Like the white snow outside... really made you yearn for the emotional range of something by either Wily G. Snuffy Coyote or Steps. </p> <p> Geiko Girl was a disappointingly dull film, not through any fault of the director, but because we now know what we really didn't want to: that far from being a highly paid wind-up erotic doll trained in the mysterious arts of pleasure giving, a career as a geisha-geiko is pretty much that of a nun with some of the perks of an airline cabin crew.</p> <p> Mamehisa's parents - father an engineer, mother a life insurance salesperson - turned up for their daughter's graduation from Maiko (a trainee) to geiko ('a woman of art') but barely hid their disappointment at her chosen career. They'd probably hoped she'd grow up to be the MD of Widget International and were justifiably disappointed to discover instead a young woman with an extraordinary lack of imagination devoted to a life in which there was 'no room for innovation or artistic freedom' but ample opportunity to create 'a discreet and uninhibited environment in which men are made to feel good about themselves'. </p> <p> Lenny Henry always gives a convincing impression of a man who feels pretty good about himself, but a trip across the Atlantic from Plymouth to Jamaica in a trimaran that looks like Thunderbird Six proves otherwise. After Joanna Lumley as a castaway and Ross Kemp in a tent in the Canadian wilderness, Lenny's Big Atlantic Adventure is the latest in the occasional let's-send-a-celebrity-off-to-do-something-a-wee-bit-scary documentary genre, but was more revealing than the others because while Lenny couldn't sail, his partner, the buoyant and heroic Tony Bullimore - who can - still famously nearly died after capsizing in a Perfect Storm. </p> <p> Last night's video diary saw our star inside the cabin 'praying for the first time since Sunday school' during a Force 8 squall he described as 'the longest 48 hours of my life', while Bullimore got on with the rough, tough and macho George Clooney stuff outside. The adventure concludes tonight and I don't think I'm giving much away by saying that, after the excitement of Part One, Part Two is scuppered by some plot twists that give far more insight into BBC management than they do the celebrity sailor's existential and elemental battles, which is a shame. Still, we can only hope the BBC continue to exploit the limitless possibilities of this genre. Who wouldn't want to watch Anthea Turner Trains as a Geiko?</p>",

Walk the galleries, and the images you see are rehearsed, staged, digitally enhanced, as post- produced as any Hollywood movie. Some of them want to look like ads or video stills or old master art. Others want the ghostly overtones that come from using glass plates or pinhole cameras. As with painting, practically every past technique has been parodied or pastiched - there are even pseudo snapshots, like the sham-casual work of Wolfgang Tillmans, shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize. But fast-action shots, contemporary equivalents of Cartier-Bresson's masterpiece of a man leaping a puddle behind the Gare St Lazare, these rarely make it into white cube galleries. </p> <p>Knut Asdan, the young Norwegian photographer, has filled a whole room of Tate Britain with massive images of high-rise apartment blocks and skyscrapers. These are hung two-deep along the walls so that they seem to imitate the grids of windows in each photograph. </p> <p>Asdan works at night. The windows in his pictures are mostly dark, except for those solitary lights you see in the small hours as the city sleeps, or just before dawn when it begins to stir. In one, a rooftop party glows like an ember in the blackness. In another, the only light comes from the moon and its earthly rival, a single streetlamp intensified by Asdan's flash. </p> <p>This is cinema's romantic repertoire - deserted streets, empty gas stations, lone insomniacs out there in the darkness. But Asdan wants to depict the buildings themselves as actively restless, an idea surely borrowed from Alfred Stieglitz's great photograph of the Flatiron Building in 1903. The Flatiron seems to move through the Whistlerian snowstorm, as Stieglitz said, like 'the bow of a monster steamer'. He waited for hours to freeze this perception. Asdan tries to force it with artificial lighting and low-density prints. The effect is fumbled and unconvincing. </p> <p>Hellen van Meene's work is also contrived - though to a better purpose. Like many contemporary photographers, van Meene is fascinated by Vermeer. She loves the reverberating mystery of his women, motionless in their tableaux of angled silver light. One of her photographs reprises 'Girl With a Pearl Earring', reversing the pose and updating the garments. The girl's sheeny hair swathes her brow and shoulders like the headdress in the painting. But her expression suggests profound melancholy, as if she knew that her face didn't fit Vermeer any more than the matronly clothes ill-suited to her gawky physique. </p> <p>Van Meene is Dutch. Her adolescent subjects are not the dime-a-dozen Lolitas of American photography but genetic descendants of the girls in northern European art. She might photograph a high-breasted Cranach Eve in her mother's bathing costume, an under-age Rubens or a snub-nosed Brueghel in a pointed hood. Her girls are listless, restive in the long school holidays, uncertain how to dispose their limbs for the camera. Misfits in their own world, they're too unsettled to understudy old masters either - a tension perfectly reproduced in the mismatch between van Meene's wary photographs and the paintings on which they draw. </p> <p>Dignifying the misrepresented - that's the routine claim made for Catherine Opie's photographs, as if a full-length shot of a nude transvestite in wig and heels, coyly clutching his genitals, was likely to give you more of the soul beneath the skin. In America, where she lives, Opie's work hangs in many art museums - portraits of dominatrixes in leather masks, pierced and tattooed lesbians and other scarified bodies, including Opie's own. Her pictures are big, formal and highly Technicolored. It may be that her studio subjects assume their own positions. If not, Opie is dealing in outsize clich\u00e9s. </p> <p>Opie also makes detailed 'portraits' of Beverly Hills houses and miniature platinum prints of empty free ways that look, as you might expect, like Victorian travel photographs. With the exception of these delicate, faux-antique pictures, her approach is baldly conventional. The mere fact of photographing the subject seems to be an end in itself, as if, like the Dutch masters who painted women scraping carrots, she felt she was representing the overlooked. In a media thick with images of tattooed torsos and LA d\u00e9cor, that is just not enough any more. </p> <p>The great advance of hand-held cameras with high-speed shutters - so often undervalued in contemporary art - was, of course, that they transformed the circumstances and thus the content of photography. Exposure times decreased from 40 minutes in 1839 to a fraction of a second by 1950 - the difference between the unnatural stasis of Victorian portraits and Harold Edgerton's famous shot of a milk drop exploding into a fabulous coronet. </p> <p>This photograph, along with Cartier-Bresson's leaping man and many other classic snapshots - to use John Herschel's term from 1852 - are included in Breathless! Photography and Time at the V&amp;A. The show begins with early speed-shutters, demonstrating their own ability to freeze cresting waves and ticking clocks. It concludes with contemporary photographs of light, speed and momentous human life. The images are breathtaking - as technical feats, but also as art.</p>",

Performing a one-off show prior to their headlining appearances at the Reading and Leeds festivals, Pulp sound like a very different band to the pin-sharp, acerbic social critics who became famous in the mid-Nineties. Beneath his skintight corduroys and black silk shirt open to the sternum, Jarvis Cocker is a changed man. </p> <p>First of all, though, it is great to welcome him back. The vacuum left by Cocker's two-year absence from the British pop scene was so huge that we had to fool ourselves into finding Robbie Williams interesting. Cocker is not only a better showman and more intelligent chronicler of fame's twilight horrors, but he writes his own tunes and dances like Travolta rather than a football hooligan. Unfortunately, the public's love for Pulp seems to have waned since the glory days of Different Class: their last album, This Is Hardcore, was a commercial disaster, and there is a curious flatness to this comeback concert, a sense that Jarvis and his fans don't know what to expect of each other any more. </p> <p>We go through the motions - chanting along to 'Common People', bouncing up and down to 'Sorted for E's and Wizz', marvelling once again at the taut perfec tion of 'Babies' - but there is a lack of real excitement in the audience, and Cocker doesn't inhabit these songs the way he used to. He still moves like a gazelle on heat, still gasps and heavy-breathes like a dirty old man with asthma, but the whole show feels weirdly anaemic, more flaccid than before. </p> <p>It could be nerves, but whatever the reason, the only tracks Cocker sings with true conviction are 'The Fear' and 'Party Hard' - both taken from his nervous breakdown period - and the new ones. And the new ones are_ a little strange . It's not that Pulp have taken the Radiohead route of dispensing with choruses - if anything, the new material is more conventional, less edgy than This Is Hardcore - but that they have added guitar solos, unironic positivity and a sort of Sixties psychedelic vibe that seems utterly alien to them. </p> <p>This new sensibility is most apparent on 'Sunrise', which hums dazedly along to Jarvis-filmed video footage of, um, the sun rising through the clouds. 'I Love Life' is more poppy, but still dissolves halfway through into epic guitar noodling, while 'Mini Timperly' is mid-tempo chart mush. Has Jarvis been smoking too many herbal cigarettes? Has he got religion? Has he fallen in love? Or maybe it's all tongue in cheek, and the new album - due early next year - will be as witty and pointed as ever? </p> <p>'This is the sound of someone losing the plot,' Cocker sings on 'The Fear'. We must fervently hope that he isn't. Because that would mean we were stuck with Robbie Williams as our national showman. Snap out of it, Jarvis - your country needs you.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A likeable 29-year-old with close-cropped red hair, a cautious smile and words that gush out in torrents of vivid imagery, Leigh Stephen Kenny is a bit of a worrier. We've met to talk about the album he has released under his initials LSK - a polished collection of smooth, strong songs that confidently blend reggae, soul, hip hop and rock in a way that is unmistakably urban and British, all held together by his sweet, soulful voice. I like the record a lot. Almost every critic so far has. Yet Leigh is worried. He's worried that the bad reviews will hurt even more when they come. He's worried that the record may be misunderstood. He's even worried that it may be too successful, that he'll be left with no new sadness to write about. </p> <p>For underneath the seductive melodies, there are dark, jagged edges here. Songs about drugs, jealousy, racism, about failed relationships, about going to the very edge of sanity and looking into the abyss. It's written from experience, he says. </p> <p>Everyone has defining moments in their childhood, memories that helped shape the way they are. Leigh tells me two of his. When he was three, he stood in his home in Kent watching his father beat his mother. She ran into the street to get away, leaving Leigh behind, and he vividly remembers his feelings of fear, of abandonment. Soon after, his dad went away, leaving his mum to bring up him and his older sister alone. </p> <p>A few years later, he was playing Action Man in the garden with his friend David until David's dad came and shouted, 'Don't play with him - his mum's a nigger!' When he asked his mother what it meant, she explained that his grandfather was a black man. No one seems to know a great deal about him. His name was Donaldo. He played in Edmundo Ross's Latin-American Jazz Band. And he once said he came from Cuba. </p> <p>Bringing up two children on a nurse's wage was a struggle, and Leigh was always teased at school: for his red hair, his hand-me-down clothes. The National Front was big in Kent at the time, and there were a lot of NF stickers and leaflets. He was a withdrawn child, always doodling and staring out of the window. He wet the bed for years, and it seemed like there were always social workers asking him questions. He was a failure academically, he wasn't good at sport or fighting, but he found refuge in music. He learned to break-dance, and at home his mum played the sounds which echo now in his music: Third World, Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Bill Withers. </p> <p>Just before Leigh turned 14, his mum married a northerner and they moved to the Swinnow estate in Bramley, Yorkshire. It was a difficult time: starting a new school, talking differently from everyone else. His sister couldn't handle it. She turned 16 soon after, and went back south on her own (their difficult relationship since is charted in 'Love and Hate', a track featuring younger sister Rhianna on vocals). But Leigh slowly made friends on the estate. He went to hip hop clubs and reggae sound systems, began making black friends, meeting their families and finding that many of them had mixed blood too. </p> <p>His art skills also began to find an outlet. Like many cities after the acid house boom, Leeds enjoyed a surge of creativity at the start of the Nineties. It had its own form of home-grown techno known as 'bleep', and local groups like LFO and Nightmares on Wax enjoyed national hits. Leigh's hand-painted T-shirts and jeans were in demand locally, and he drew flyers for many of the new club nights, even designing the sleeve for the Nightmares on Wax album Smoker's Delight . </p> <p>Inevitably, there were drugs, which made Leigh even more sensitive and introverted. Then when his long-term girlfriend left him, his world caved in. 'I take things to heart anyway, and when you mess with drugs you open doors that shouldn't be opened,' he says. 'I just dug a hole that got deeper and deeper, and I didn't have the balls to say anything to anybody. If you're the bloke in a house, you've got to be a certain way, haven't you?' </p> <p>He tried to kill himself, and ended up at the age of 22 in a psychiatric hospital. It was the patients there, he says, who pulled him back from the brink. Many had serious mental health problems, and he came to see that his own troubles were relatively minor, that being a bit messed up needn't stop him getting on with his life. </p> <p>When he left hospital two months later, things moved fast. He met electronics whiz Phil Naylor in a pub, they wrote some songs together, and within a month all the major labels were showing interest. 'I'd been told I was shit all my life, and I didn't know how to handle a compliment. I'd find myself going to the toilet even though I didn't need to, just to get out of the room - I felt so anxious sitting around these people and almost being analysed again. People buying you food and giving you CDs... it just happened so quickly.' </p> <p>Phil and Leigh hastily formed a band, and Bedlam Ago Go signed to Sony. Fusing hip hop and hardcore rock, their album, Estate Style Entertainment, came out in 1997, a scream of frustration and anger. When I wonder what happened to Leigh between the aggressive shout of Bedlam and the mellow whisper of LSK, he answers without hesitation. His partner, Caroline, is what happened, and their three-year-old daughter Ella. Finally, it seems, he's found a fragile happiness, and the music he is making now reflects that. 'It's more mature, I suppose. There's still some aggression. But having a kid, you learn that to get your point across, you haven't always got to shout.' </p> <p>\u0095 LSK is out on 4 September</p>",

When he left hospital two months later, things moved fast. He met electronics whiz Phil Naylor in a pub, they wrote some songs together, and within a month all the major labels were showing interest. 'I'd been told I was shit all my life, and I didn't know how to handle a compliment. I'd find myself going to the toilet even though I didn't need to, just to get out of the room - I felt so anxious sitting around these people and almost being analysed again. People buying you food and giving you CDs... it just happened so quickly.' Phil and Leigh hastily formed a band, and Bedlam Ago Go signed to Sony. Fusing hip hop and hardcore rock, their album, Estate Style Entertainment, came out in 1997, a scream of frustration and anger. When I wonder what happened to Leigh between the aggressive shout of Bedlam and the mellow whisper of LSK, he answers without hesitation. His partner, Caroline, is what happened, and their three-year-old daughter Ella. Finally, it seems, he's found a fragile happiness, and the music he is making now reflects that. 'It's more mature, I suppose. There's still some aggression. But having a kid, you learn that to get your point across, you haven't always got to shout.' \u0095 LSK is out on 4 September",

      "body": "<p>On 18 September 1970, the rock world was shaken by the news of Jimi Hendrix's death. It had been known for some months he'd been in an increasingly bad way due to the escalating amount of drugs he was using, and his recent appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival had been largely panned, but nobody was prepared for this. In a basement flat in Notting Hill his girlfriend, Monika Dannemann, woke up, couldn't rouse him and called an ambulance. Hendrix was pronounced dead upon arrival at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington. Possessed of an extraordinary musical talent that was still developing, he'd only been in Britain for four years. </p> <p>His death, on 18 September 1970, stunned a business that, apart from Brian Jones's drowning in 1969, hadn't yet been hit by the relentless overdose toll of the Seventies. The anniversary will be marked next month by a flurry of reminiscences in the mainstream and music press. I was working on a music paper when it happened and had met Hendrix a few times. Contrary to his initially scary appearance - so cool, so wild, so amazingly dressed - and powerful on-stage presence (I've seen his opening chord cause a nosebleed), he was gentle, courteous (a door opener, a stand-up-when-you-entered-a-room guy) and shy. </p> <p>Probably the most famous image of him is the one here, taken in calmer and more lucid times for Hendrix back in 1967. It was a photo session organised for his first album Are You Experienced , taken against a plain backdrop one lazy afternoon. Nobody, particularly the photographer Gered Mankowitz, could realise what an iconic image it would become. </p> <p>The session had come about through a mixture of location and Mankowitz's growing reputation as a rock photographer. His tiny studio in Mason's Yard, just off Piccadilly, was next to one of the hippest clubs of the time, the Scotch of St James, and close to the offices of Hendrix's manager, Chas Chandler. </p> <p>Says Mankowitz: 'Chas was a hard-assed Newcastle bloke, nice, straight who had been the bass player with the Animals. I'd never photographed them, but done some work with him. He told me he'd found this phenomenal guitarist who was extraordinary looking, who he reckoned was going to be huge. </p> <p>'I went down to the Bag O'Nails to see him. It was a seething mass of people because word had got around: Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton were all there. And Jimi was mesmerising. I'm not sure if it was his music as much as his style - he was doing things with a guitar that had never been done before.' </p> <p>In the late Sixties and early Seventies the music business was small and contained. Everybody knew each other and hung out together, so news of this remarkable new guitarist went round like wildfire. A friend, Yardbird bassist Paul Samwell-Smith, remembers a hilarious impromptu evening jamming with Hendrix as a background to some Scaffold poetry with, incredibly, Jane Asher's mother on violin. There were no VIP areas in clubs, no bouncers, no security guards. You were quite likely to run into Hendrix or Jagger buying clothes in Granny Takes a Trip, or rummaging for antique shirts and coats in Chelsea Antiques Market. </p> <p>Mankowitz, 20 in 1967, in his Take Six velvet suits and perennial dark glasses was very much part of the scene. He was truly cool because he was never starstruck due to growing up surrounded by the stars that inhabited the world of his film-producer father, Wolf Mankowitz. Gered had done film stills on sets, toured America with the Rolling Stones in 1965 and photographed Marianne Faithfull. </p> <p>He'd acquired his first floor studio in Mason's Yard when he was 17. Painted brown and white with orange water pipes, on the landing there was a blown-up comic image of Batman with a bubble coming out of his mouth saying: 'It's as well to remember that evil is a pretty bad thing.' It was a hip hangout. Rock stars would often call in on their way to the Scotch, smoke some dope and carry on their way. </p> <p>For the Are You Experienced session Hendrix arrived with bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell at around midday: nobody ever got up much before about then. They were wearing the clothes they were to be photographed in and wore them to a gig later (they weren't well off and didn't possess that many) and make-up artists, PAs and stylists were unknown commodities then. </p> <p>'It was all very relaxed. I always got some food in from Fortnum and Mason round the corner, and we smoked some dope and took the pictures. It wasn't difficult to capture Jimi's image because he exuded this extraordinary power and charisma - the guy just took hold of the camera. </p> <p>'People are naturally nervous in front of a camera and Jimi was no different. He didn't like it much, and he didn't smile because the whole idea of it was to appear cool and moody - we wanted to be the antithesis of the publicity photograph. The famous smoking shot was with an ordinary cigarette - you had to be really careful in those days and it would have been irresponsible to publish a picture of someone smoking a joint, although I do have a picture of Keith Richards with one.' </p> <p>A couple of months later, Mankowitz did the second Hendrix studio session - an indication of how intensively he was being worked. 'I'd seen him around in clubs and he'd always pop in to the studio for a smoke on his way to the Scotch. We'd chat, gossip. I liked him a lot. He had no side to him, no hidden agenda. He was a good guy.' </p> <p>Little did Mankowitz realise the value of his photographic archive which moved from studio to studio in plastic carrier bags. His father had advised him to never throw anything away, so he stowed the bags in the corner and gradually the Sixties and Seventies began to gain iconic status. Mankowitz started to exhibit the pictures of Hendrix, the Stones, Marianne, Kate Bush, Eric Clapton and many others. He organised the prints into limited editions and collectors started to pour in. He also got together with graphic designer David Costa (son of DJ Sam) and produced a series of silk screen prints from the pictures. Inevitably there is piracy. Sometimes Mankowitz is successful in reclaiming or charging for the use of his images, more often in the case of T-shirts and posters the process is too complicated. The Hendrix legacy is now big business run by his family, and there is a museum in his birthplace of Seattle. </p> <p>For the older generation remembering how you heard of Hendrix's death ranks alongside Lennon and Kennedy. </p> <p>'By the time he died a lot of people were accidents waiting to happen,' says Mankowitz.

I still have a photograph of me at 18 sitting at the side of a sunny, foreign byway strumming a guitar, as telling an image of gormless youth as you could wish to disown even by the standards of an era in which the market for embroidered, flapping trousers was close to saturation. </p> <p>My journey of discovery started in the pub with Keith and Roy, who had decided to escape to Rotterdam in their annual break from the dyeworks and asked if I wanted to come. Rotterdam! Naturally, I leapt at the chance, because although I wasn't really interested in canals and tulips, I'd heard the stories about loose women who sat in their living-room windows half-naked and combing their hair. I was so giddy with expectation that I wittered on about the trip until I was gently corrected on my uncertain grasp of geography by one of the mechanics at the tyre depot in Leeds where I'd had a job since I left school at 16, answering the phone and being sent out for lard sandwiches.'That's Amsterdam, you twat,' he said. </p> <p>Keith and Roy had decided on Rotterdam for no better reason than that was where the ferry stopped. The 'idea' was that we would make our way back to England through, er_ whichever countries were on the way back to England. Plus, it was only \u00a39.25 from Hull, they said, which meant more mileage for our money. Luckily, the mechanic at work had to go to Hull to do a big installation (air ring-main, not conceptual art) and he gave us a lift in the back of his van, which he'd specially fitted out for the three of us with heaps of metal tubing, grease-producing equipment and a rubber hose leading to the exhaust pipe. </p> <p>The overnight ferry was more promising, mainly because of the cheap beer and disco, and though the crossing was a bit rocky it did provide us with the unending novelty of uphill dancing and having to walk sideways to the bar. I don't know what happened to the others but Igot talking to a German girl called Astrid who couldn't speak a word of English, though, by then, neither could I. Then one of the deckhands kindly offered to lend us his cabin for half an hour. Yesss! The downside was that he had invited his shipmates to watch us through a little window above the door, which was a bit off-putting for Astrid, especially the noise of people falling off the chair. So, instead of being able to celebrate my first lewd encounter with a foreign woman, (not including ones in magazines), I ended up on the sleeping-deck surrounded by snoring drunks, until eventually one of them was me. </p> <p>The rest of our trip was quite good. In the absence of our not having planned anything in the slightest, we left Rotterdam on the first train going somewhere none of us had ever heard of. But we were soon befriended by some girl students who mistook us for someone more intelligent and took us back to their house to listen to jazz records, before ferrying us to a remote campsite, where we were trapped for days listening to Keith's radio. Eventually, we walked back to town and Roy took the photograph of me at the side of the road. </p> <p>Back in the station, we decided to move on to France before we ran out of guilders, but none of us could pronounce 'Boulogne' to the satisfaction of the ticket seller. Some days later, we arrived in Beauloeuilgne, a town known only to its 14 inhabitants and a dog that barked at us from a yard across from the platform where we pitched our sleeping bags. Things were fraught. Keith said it might help the situation if I put the guitar away and stopped singing 'Homeward Bound', especially the bit about sitting in a railway station. Next morning, we located France on Keith's map and spelled out 'Boulogne' to the ticket seller in an attempt to reduce the chances of our ending up in Bologna or Bulawayo. </p> <p>At last we arrived in Boulogne. We camped on the dunes with the white cliffs of Dover just across the water. We swam in the sea with our clothes on. We listened to Keith's radio ('Rock On' by David Essex was at No 1).

Lying dormant, however, was a deeper, more threatening incompatibility than any of these. Our friendship dissolved in a puddle of sterilising fluid, the time he and his wife Mary brought their two little girls for the weekend. Since then it's been just Christmas cards. Not just any Christmas cards of course. The Good Tidings that these cards bring are all of my ex-friends themselves, or more particularly, of their children.

From the moment I first arrived in London in 1964, my heart beat faster here, although in those days we would have starved to death without the Chinese and had to wear mittens to work in some of the libraries. In the Seventies we came back for two sabbaticals, sent our kids to London schools, became addicted to Coronation Street , and developed an attachment to the culture and lifestyle of the place that has become deeper every year. </p> <p>London is a great city first of all because things that are scattered all over most countries are located here in one place: government, the arts,fashion, medicine, the financial centre, sports, the film and television industries, publishing and journalism. There's a concentration of creativity and talent which is unequalled anywhere else in the world. It also has a truly liveable scale, in part because of its history as a set of villages,and in part because the skyscrapers are mainly along the river in the second, twin London that has sprouted magically in the past decade. </p> <p>My husband (whose name, believe it or not, is English Showalter) and I are among that much-ridiculed group of American tourists who come for the theatre, and our son's early exposure to great performers like Ian Charleson, Antony Sher and Jonathan Pryce helped convince him to become an actor. I have grey hairs to show for that. But London theatre also has an intimacy, continuity, and scope that American theatre painfully lacks, and the London cultural boom offers as much to Americans as to Brits. There is no American national theatre in the States, but here we can see Miller, Mamet, Williams, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein and O'Neill. In the reading rooms of the new, state-of-the-art British Library, American professors and graduate students fill half the seats. The Tate Modern has one of the world's great collections of contemporary American art. </p> <p>Over the years we've tried to give back some of the pleasure we've received by becoming members and supporters of various theatres and museums, an effort that provides much more in the way of acknowledgment and real opportunity to connect than the over-priced nominal boards of their New York equivalents. </p> <p>There are things I don't admire about London. I think that street beggars have gotten out of hand and that there must be a better way for the Government to handle homelessness than to have five young men and two dogs sitting outside the supermarket (as they are in my neighbourhood), drinking beer, cooking sausages over a campfire, and harassing the shoppers for change. I don't like the Tube, or the traffic, although compared to New York's subway the former looks pretty good, and my husband swears that English drivers are the most courteous in the world. </p> <p>But I love it when a cab driver entertains us with imitations of Russell Crowe and Elvis, and gets us to our remote destination with dispatch as well. I'm dazzled by British classiness at Wimbledon, because if Americans hadn't won a sports competition for 65 years they damn well would stop hosting it. I'm excited by the cultural variety of London, and the ferocious energy of the British press, and soothed by living in a city where I can hear seagulls as well as pigeons, where a quarter-inch of snow seems like a blizzard and 80 degrees Fahrenheit is called a heatwave. I don't plan to move to London permanently. My dream would be an Atlantic tunnel, where I could zip back and forth and have the best of both worlds. But I've given my personal papers to the Fawcett Library so that in the future, if there's another young American feminist who wants to know about me, she will have to come to London to find out.

      "body": "<p>The day traders are restive. The bulletin boards are up in arms. The internet is positively revolting. What's sparked the outcry? An end to share tips on <a href=\"http://www.Sharepages.com\" target=\"_new\">Sharepages.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Digitallook.com\" target=\"_new\">Digitallook.com</a>, two of the burgeoning number of financial websites, courtesy of the suits in hobnail boots at the Financial Services Authority (FSA). </p> <p>From some of the press reports last week, readers may indeed have gained the impression that the regulators were now cracking down in the most cackhanded, discriminatory and Canute-likefashion on the net. And why pick on just these two? After all, they were simply printing round-ups of newspaper tips. So why should that constitute giving 'unauthorised financial advice'? </p> <p>What about the papers themselves? And other websites, like <a href=\"http://www.Breakingviews.com\" target=\"_new\">Breakingviews.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.Sharecast.com\" target=\"_new\">Sharecast.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.TheStreet.com\" target=\"_new\">TheStreet.com</a>? And, for that matter, <a href=\"http://www.FT.com\" target=\"_new\">FT.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.GuardianUnlimited.co.uk\">GuardianUnlimited.co.uk</a> and all Fleet Street's online shadows? Or, indeed, the venerable Reuters news agency, which produces its own round-up of Sunday newspaper tips for traders at the start of every week. </p> <p>The reality, however, is less dramatic. For a long time the FSA has been concerned about the net. It would be nonsensical if it weren't. After all, a year ago there were no online brokers and now they number 30-plus. Flotations are being handled over the net. And, of course, insider information - or juicy titbits dressed up as such - is increasingly being posted anonymously on the web, with share prices gyrating wildly as a result. </p> <p>The travails of Dan Wagner's old Dialog site (now Brightstation.com, see graph) through the net rumour mill are legendary. Deals like Reckitt &amp; Colman's merger with Benckiser have broken on bulletin boards, prompting hasty announcements. So the FSA is quite right to try, at least, to 'police the net'. It's nothing to do with stopping free speech. It's about stopping market manipulation. And market abuse usually means it's the ordinary punters, including many now mouthing off on the net, who get suckered. </p> <p>Since its inception three years ago, the FSA has been in constant dialogue with financial websites. And what happened last week was that, in the course of talks, Sharepages voluntarily withdrew its own summary and spin on newspaper tips. Digitallook.com, meanwhile, had altered its service nine months ago. So, presto, there was no 'crackdown' or 'net blackout', despite the dramatic headlines. And importantly - if you do use the web for tips - there's also no implication, therefore, that one site is 'safer' or more reliable than another simply because it's not been 'cracked down on'. </p> <p>The truth is, in this greyest of areas, that the FSA has to make do with legislation - the Financial Services Act 1986 - drawn up when the world wide web was but a twinkle in a spider's eye. At the moment - for the protection of investors - no one can give 'investment advice' unless they are registered with and regulated by the FSA. Newspapers and magazines are specifically exempt and can tip shares, as long as this is not their principal business. It's an anomaly, certainly, and one highlighted by the antics of the Mirror 's ex-City Slickers. But it's one the FSA, for now, has to live with. </p> <p>So, for financial websites, there are two ways to go. Register with the FSA, as some popular sites like Hemscott.net and Interactive Investor already have and others, such as Sharecast and Sharepages, are now doing. Or get yourself registered as a newspaper. This, however, is where the present law falls down. Websites have taken to scribbling issue numbers in page corners to try to satisfy definitions of what constitutes a periodical or publication under present law. </p> <p>Pragmatically, the FSA exempts the likes of FT.com, because it is part of a newspaper group. Pragmatically, too, Reuters poses no problem as it has a long track record of objective reporting. But the FSA appreciates that in today's environment this is arbitrary, to say the the least. And that's why there's been no crackdown, but rather a behind-the-scenes dialogue. </p> <p>Not before time, the law is now finally about to embrace the net. Next month, the Treasury will consult on an updated list of exemptions before the new Financial Markets Bill becomes law next year. So there's no reason why online news services shouldn't be treated like their newsprint rivals. Furthermore, either by legislation or through tightening of the Press Complaints Commission's Code of Practice, share-dealing by press tipsters is either going to be restricted or better disclosed. And everyone - in the markets, in Fleet Street or on the net - will be caught by new civil powers to prevent 'market abuse'. </p> <p>Naturally, there are many on the net who say, why bother? Let caveat emptor apply. People are smart enough not to be taken in by scurrilous rumours. That, however, is an argument against any regulation at all and, the trouble is, people do get taken to the cleaners. </p> <p>Clearly, investors who use bulletin boards should always be wary, and realise that a website's registration with the FSA is no guarantee of either good advice or a con-free zone. Before dealing on internet tips, readers should see FSA's succinct warning about bulletin boards. Go to <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>, click on 'Consumer Help', then 'What's New' for 'Consumer Alerts'. </p> <p><strong> Shake-out survivor</strong><br> Whither Durlacher, the pioneering broker whose fortunes are most closely identified with the net? After a breathtaking rise at the height of dotcom mania, Durlacher's shares have since plummeted in the shake-out. To phrase the question in quite those terms, however, is to miss the point. </p> <p>The broker, headed by Geoffrey Chamberlain, is no more finished because the market's come to its senses than any pilot who makes a safe landing. And, remember, investors have still done exceedingly well out of Durlacher's impressive seven-year rise as nurturer of internet start-ups and flotations. </p> <p>Known for backing success stories like Autonomy and 365 Corp, Durlacher is now using its expertise to mould and take far bigger stakes in technology companies. The latest is KVault Software, which helps firms archive and retrieve emails using technology first developed at Compaq. There's life, therefore, in Durlacher yet.
