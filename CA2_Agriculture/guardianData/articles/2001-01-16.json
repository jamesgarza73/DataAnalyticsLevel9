Belgium is Congo's former colonial ruler. Asked about the report, Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji said: \"The Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs can say what he wants but I will make my announcement tomorrow.\" A member of Kabila's security entourage said on condition of anonymity that the bodyguard had shot the president in the back and right leg. Kabila was alive and was being treated by doctors, he said without elaborating. French diplomats in Paris also said they believed Kabila had been shot but was alive. Intelligence officers in Rwanda said they had unconfirmed reports that Kabila was killed in the intense shooting at the presidential palace, which lasted half an hour. Rwanda supports rebels fighting to topple the Congolese strongman. Kabila's government would not be publicly drawn on their president's condition, or even whether he'd been shot. \"President Kabila is alive and everything is OK,\" said Congolese General Francois Olenga. The conflicting reports came hours after witnesses told of 30 minutes of gunfire around the home of Kabila, who has been fighting multiple rebel armies for more than two years. It was unclear who was responsible for the shooting. A presidential helicopter landed at Kinshasa's main hospital, a government official who witnessed the event said, adding there were unconfirmed reports that the aircraft was carrying Kabila's son, Joseph Kabila, who had apparently been injured. The younger Kabila is the head of Congo's military. Presidential aide Eddy Kapend went on national television shortly after the gunfire ended to appeal for calm, but he made no mention of the incident. The bleary-eyed Kapend ordered that all airports and borders be closed, appealing to the armed forces and civil society leaders to help maintain order. \"The Congolese people need your serenity and your discipline,\" he said. Later, an 8pm to 6am curfew was announced by Kakudji as having being ordered by Kabila himself. Kakudji also put all fighting units in Kinshasa on alert until further notice.

      "body": "<p>Doug Ellis has greeted the arrival of Aston Villa's most expensive signing Juan Pablo Angel by issuing a double vote of confidence - in himself and his manager John Gregory. </p> <p>The Colombian striker completed his \u00a39.5m move from River Plate of Argentina yesterday, a transfer that will silence, at least temporarily, the fans' rising dissatisfaction with Ellis. </p> <p>But the Villa chairman, 77, is adamant neither age nor disgruntled supporters will force him to relinquish the job he has held for almost 20 years. </p> <p>\"I am chairman and I plan to remain chairman,\" he said. \"I have no intention of resigning. I am mentally alert, physically agile and can still take on anyone.\" </p> <p>Ellis's determination to continue suggests his tenure of office is in the lap of the gods but there is one decision that remains his: he wants Gregory to be at the club as long as he is chairman, despite reports of a serious rift between the pair. </p> <p>Tensions boiled over just after Christmas when Gregory humiliated his chairman by making personal criticisms of him in a Sunday paper. </p> <p>Yet during the inevitable dressing-down of the chastened Gregory, Ellis made it clear he wanted him to be a long-term fixture at Villa Park. </p> <p>\"The chairman repeated to me what he told me in May,\" Gregory said. \"He wants me to be the last manager to work under him at Aston Villa.\" </p> <p>Ellis hopes he has raised Gregory's chance of going the distance by sanctioning the signing of the 25-year-old Angel. </p> <p>\"We've backed John Gregory to the hilt on this signing in every respect,\" Ellis added. \"Payments for transfers can usually be spread but in this case we have had to pay cash and settle the account straight away. He chooses the players and he picks his team - there is no interference from us.\" </p> <p>Angel's arrival ends a six-month quest for a quality striker by Gregory, who now must hope a player he sees as the one to reignite Villa's season does not turn into an expensive flop. </p> <p>Despite Ellis's encouraging sentiments, Gregory's position must be tenuous after both his criticisms and his team's recent record. </p> <p>Villa have won only one Premiership game in the last 10 and with fixtures to come against Manchester United, Leeds and Ipswich he may be heading for the exit door come the end of the month. </p> <p>But Gregory is confident Angel can deliver - \"he can score goals of all kinds, tap-ins and spectacular ones. That's what he does. His recent record of 17 from his last 17 games speaks for itself and he is hungry for them. In one game I watched him, he had five shots in the first five minutes. </p> <p>\"He knows what is expected of him: he realises we've suffered in the past two seasons because we have not had someone to convert chances. He is confident he can put that right.\" </p> <p>Angel's arrival is set to threaten David Ginola's brief time at the club. Recently he has partnered Dion Dublin up front but, with Gregory favouring a 3-5-2 formation and Paul Merson excelling in the free role Ginola might otherwise occupy, the Frenchman may find himself sidelined. </p> <p>Ginola was substituted at half-time in Villa's dismal display against Liverpool on Saturday. \"I was very disappointed with him,\" said Gregory. \"The least I expect from any player is for them to come off at the end knowing they have given their all.\" </p> <p>With Angel ineligible to play in tomorrow's FA Cup replay against Newcastle Ginola may get another chance. But the newcomer is set to play a part at Old Trafford on Saturday. </p> <p>\"I've been on holiday since the Argentinian season ended just before Christmas so I am not fully match fit,\" said Angel. \"But I am very keen to get started and settled in England.\" </p> <p>Gareth Barry has started talks over a new contract with Villa. Gregory is keen to tie the central defender to a five-year deal that would keep him at the club until 2006. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Yet during the inevitable dressing-down of the chastened Gregory, Ellis made it clear he wanted him to be a long-term fixture at Villa Park. \"The chairman repeated to me what he told me in May,\" Gregory said. \"He wants me to be the last manager to work under him at Aston Villa.\" Ellis hopes he has raised Gregory's chance of going the distance by sanctioning the signing of the 25-year-old Angel. \"We've backed John Gregory to the hilt on this signing in every respect,\" Ellis added. \"Payments for transfers can usually be spread but in this case we have had to pay cash and settle the account straight away. He chooses the players and he picks his team - there is no interference from us.\" Angel's arrival ends a six-month quest for a quality striker by Gregory, who now must hope a player he sees as the one to reignite Villa's season does not turn into an expensive flop. Despite Ellis's encouraging sentiments, Gregory's position must be tenuous after both his criticisms and his team's recent record. Villa have won only one Premiership game in the last 10 and with fixtures to come against Manchester United, Leeds and Ipswich he may be heading for the exit door come the end of the month. But Gregory is confident Angel can deliver - \"he can score goals of all kinds, tap-ins and spectacular ones. That's what he does. His recent record of 17 from his last 17 games speaks for itself and he is hungry for them. In one game I watched him, he had five shots in the first five minutes. \"He knows what is expected of him: he realises we've suffered in the past two seasons because we have not had someone to convert chances. He is confident he can put that right.\" Angel's arrival is set to threaten David Ginola's brief time at the club. Recently he has partnered Dion Dublin up front but, with Gregory favouring a 3-5-2 formation and Paul Merson excelling in the free role Ginola might otherwise occupy, the Frenchman may find himself sidelined. Ginola was substituted at half-time in Villa's dismal display against Liverpool on Saturday. \"I was very disappointed with him,\" said Gregory. \"The least I expect from any player is for them to come off at the end knowing they have given their all.\" With Angel ineligible to play in tomorrow's FA Cup replay against Newcastle Ginola may get another chance. But the newcomer is set to play a part at Old Trafford on Saturday. \"I've been on holiday since the Argentinian season ended just before Christmas so I am not fully match fit,\" said Angel. \"But I am very keen to get started and settled in England.\" Gareth Barry has started talks over a new contract with Villa. Gregory is keen to tie the central defender to a five-year deal that would keep him at the club until 2006. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Leboeuf argues that because he has not asked for a transfer he is owed \u00a31m for the remainder of his contract. </p> <p>However a deal is almost certain to go through this week, and the Marseille-born defender was in France on Sunday tying up loose ends. \"I have had some great times with Chelsea, but I feel a need to go back to France and rediscover my home region,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It is now time for me to move on and win trophies with Monaco.

      "bodyText": "The new broom sweeping through Chelsea should finally see Frank Leboeuf move to Monaco this week in a deal worth around \u00a33m. He has played 197 games for Chelsea since arriving from Strasbourg for \u00a32.5m in 1996, but has fallen victim to the coach Claudio Ranieri's drive to lower the average age of his squad. It is understood Monaco have yet to increase their \u00a32m offer for the 33-year-old France defender to meet Chelsea's \u00a33m valuation. Leboeuf argues that because he has not asked for a transfer he is owed \u00a31m for the remainder of his contract. However a deal is almost certain to go through this week, and the Marseille-born defender was in France on Sunday tying up loose ends. \"I have had some great times with Chelsea, but I feel a need to go back to France and rediscover my home region,\" he said. \"It is now time for me to move on and win trophies with Monaco. They share my ideas, and they deserve better than to be where they are at the moment - 14th in the table.\" IFK Gothenburg are interested in taking Manchester United's Jesper Blomqvist back to Sweden. The 26-year-old, whose deal expires in the summer, joined United from Parma for \u00a34.4m in 1998 but last played in the 1999 European Cup final, when he was substituted. An ankle then a knee injury have sidelined him since. \"If he can't play before his contract expires then United will probably not extend it, and he knows that we want him to join us,\" said Gothenburg's coach Roger Gustafsson. Blackburn's Jeff Kenna, 30, has asked for a move after becoming disillusioned at his lack of opportunities. Bolton's goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen will miss the rest of the season with cruciate-ligament damage. Brentford fans will today step up their campaign to buy the club from the chairman Ron Noades. A delegation will meet the government-sponsored organisation Supporters Direct to enlist its help in setting up a trust similar to the one which has taken over Lincoln. Noades has refused fans the first option on buying the club, saying he has other purchasers lined up. Brentford sustained reported losses of \u00a31m last year and Noades is looking to sell Griffin Park at the end of the season to raise about \u00a36m towards the cost of a stadium in Feltham, near Heathrow airport. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The greatest vice of the New Labour mind is intolerance. It may often not know, at first, what to think itself. It has little guiding ideology. It often seeks the opinion of focus groups - tiny minorities raised to the level of universal science - before deciding what exactly to do about even the biggest issues in the fields of crime, or schooling, or healthcare, or the euro. But other minorities are not so exalted. Once the hesitations of the New Labour mind have been settled, dissenters have to be marginalised. This paradox, of uncertainty coexisting with intolerance, is the unique spectacle New Labour has brought to British politics.</p> <p>The intolerance doesn't invariably start at the top. The determination to ban hunting with dogs seems to be mainly an impulse springing from the urban grass-roots. Its intransigence is a way of compensating for the absence of moral compass in many other areas. It sweeps aside all arguments there might be about the science, the economics, the social costs, the rural consequences and the libertarian price with a Jacobin insistence that such quibbling cannot be permitted to override the class reasons to abolish hunting or the hypocritical assertion that the issue is all about animal pain.</p> <p>On each of those aspects, as the Burns report showed, there is much to be said on both sides. There is no conclusive case either way on the science, the economics, the social costs or the rural consequences of a ban. The liberty question, on the other hand, is extremely clear. In the absence of a conclusive case for abolishing a sport that has been part of British country life for centuries and is harmless to the majority who rail against it, the libertarian case should be decisive. If, that is, the politicians in whose hands the decision rests have a secure grasp on the rights of minorities. Not only does New Labour, as we will see when it votes tomorrow, wallow in scorn for the hunting minority, so do the Liberal Democrats, whose official position, declared by Simon Hughes with blind indifference to anything recognisable as liberalism, is for a ban.</p> <p>A few cabinet ministers, to their credit, do not go that far. Jack Straw and Robin Cook won't vote for a ban. But they will then find themselves immersed in a larger issue, where their instincts are unlikely to be so reliable. For the hunting bill, though nodded through by the last-gasp class-warriors of the Commons, will be stalled in the Lords. This is part of the plan. Let the warriors have their red meat in the Commons, but then recognise that the Lords will stop it being finally devoured before the election, thus perhaps giving hope to rural voters that the hunt may in fact survive. Fat chance. But another casus belli will be in place for a much more serious onslaught, against the second chamber.</p> <p>This is a case of intolerance at the very top. Mr Blair is committed to a second stage of reform of the Lords, which has been much debated. It is an extremely thorny issue, on which it was always possible nothing further would be done. The manifesto needs to declare what shape an intended reform will take, and there are voices gathering to press for something more radical than even the copious discussions of the past three years have envisaged.</p> <p>With the second chamber, the choice for any democrat has to lie between making it more legitimate or less potent. So far, Labour has taken, however mildly, the legitimacy option. By excluding most hereditary peers, and preparing to reduce the control of political patronage over new life peers, it has given the Lords the appearance of modernity. Largely bogus though this is, it has been embraced to some effect by the peerage. They have grown stroppy in their obstructions and pious about their rights. In the last session they stopped some measures, like the bill to limit jury trial, and, by exerting incessant pressure on the government's timetable, amended several others.</p> <p>So legitimacy has its costs for government. It also raises the hideous question of what to do next. An elected element, however small, would only make legitimacy more of a pain. The other day Mr Blair reacted with severity to the notion that the Lords should be anything more than a \"revising\" chamber, in terms that made clear his resistance to it being a rival to the Commons. He spoke not just against anything like equality between the houses, but, it seemed, against the smallest degree of even temporary equivalence - which is what the Lords can now claim when exercising their modest powers to delay measures and sometimes, depending on the timetable, kill them.</p> <p>What's therefore under discussion is the impotence option. Why not reduce the Lords' powers still further, to ensure it can't do the kind of things it did as the last session was struggling to its end? Why, when you get down to it, should unelected persons ever have decisive influence over the will of the people as represented by a mandated government? Isn't it time, in all contemporary truth, to deploy the Lords as a forum to which revision work may be subcontracted, but to insist that, if ever its revisions displeased the government, they could simply be chucked away? Since we do not plan to make the Lords more legitimate, how can we tolerate the defiling of democracy that is represented by its power?</p> <p>A fair number of New Labourites would like to follow this logic. It would bring the attractions of single-chamber government without the odium of openly introducing one. There might be a second-chamber recruitment problem later.

      "bodyText": "The greatest vice of the New Labour mind is intolerance. It may often not know, at first, what to think itself. It has little guiding ideology. It often seeks the opinion of focus groups - tiny minorities raised to the level of universal science - before deciding what exactly to do about even the biggest issues in the fields of crime, or schooling, or healthcare, or the euro. But other minorities are not so exalted. Once the hesitations of the New Labour mind have been settled, dissenters have to be marginalised. This paradox, of uncertainty coexisting with intolerance, is the unique spectacle New Labour has brought to British politics. The intolerance doesn't invariably start at the top. The determination to ban hunting with dogs seems to be mainly an impulse springing from the urban grass-roots. Its intransigence is a way of compensating for the absence of moral compass in many other areas. It sweeps aside all arguments there might be about the science, the economics, the social costs, the rural consequences and the libertarian price with a Jacobin insistence that such quibbling cannot be permitted to override the class reasons to abolish hunting or the hypocritical assertion that the issue is all about animal pain. On each of those aspects, as the Burns report showed, there is much to be said on both sides. There is no conclusive case either way on the science, the economics, the social costs or the rural consequences of a ban. The liberty question, on the other hand, is extremely clear. In the absence of a conclusive case for abolishing a sport that has been part of British country life for centuries and is harmless to the majority who rail against it, the libertarian case should be decisive. If, that is, the politicians in whose hands the decision rests have a secure grasp on the rights of minorities. Not only does New Labour, as we will see when it votes tomorrow, wallow in scorn for the hunting minority, so do the Liberal Democrats, whose official position, declared by Simon Hughes with blind indifference to anything recognisable as liberalism, is for a ban. A few cabinet ministers, to their credit, do not go that far. Jack Straw and Robin Cook won't vote for a ban. But they will then find themselves immersed in a larger issue, where their instincts are unlikely to be so reliable. For the hunting bill, though nodded through by the last-gasp class-warriors of the Commons, will be stalled in the Lords. This is part of the plan. Let the warriors have their red meat in the Commons, but then recognise that the Lords will stop it being finally devoured before the election, thus perhaps giving hope to rural voters that the hunt may in fact survive. Fat chance. But another casus belli will be in place for a much more serious onslaught, against the second chamber. This is a case of intolerance at the very top. Mr Blair is committed to a second stage of reform of the Lords, which has been much debated. It is an extremely thorny issue, on which it was always possible nothing further would be done. The manifesto needs to declare what shape an intended reform will take, and there are voices gathering to press for something more radical than even the copious discussions of the past three years have envisaged. With the second chamber, the choice for any democrat has to lie between making it more legitimate or less potent. So far, Labour has taken, however mildly, the legitimacy option. By excluding most hereditary peers, and preparing to reduce the control of political patronage over new life peers, it has given the Lords the appearance of modernity. Largely bogus though this is, it has been embraced to some effect by the peerage. They have grown stroppy in their obstructions and pious about their rights. In the last session they stopped some measures, like the bill to limit jury trial, and, by exerting incessant pressure on the government's timetable, amended several others. So legitimacy has its costs for government. It also raises the hideous question of what to do next. An elected element, however small, would only make legitimacy more of a pain. The other day Mr Blair reacted with severity to the notion that the Lords should be anything more than a \"revising\" chamber, in terms that made clear his resistance to it being a rival to the Commons. He spoke not just against anything like equality between the houses, but, it seemed, against the smallest degree of even temporary equivalence - which is what the Lords can now claim when exercising their modest powers to delay measures and sometimes, depending on the timetable, kill them. What's therefore under discussion is the impotence option. Why not reduce the Lords' powers still further, to ensure it can't do the kind of things it did as the last session was struggling to its end? Why, when you get down to it, should unelected persons ever have decisive influence over the will of the people as represented by a mandated government? Isn't it time, in all contemporary truth, to deploy the Lords as a forum to which revision work may be subcontracted, but to insist that, if ever its revisions displeased the government, they could simply be chucked away? Since we do not plan to make the Lords more legitimate, how can we tolerate the defiling of democracy that is represented by its power? A fair number of New Labourites would like to follow this logic. It would bring the attractions of single-chamber government without the odium of openly introducing one. There might be a second-chamber recruitment problem later. Meanwhile most of the peerage already present would be happy with their gongs, and any opposition the Commons might offer to serious Lords reform would be neutered at a stroke. Only a government with an impaired sense of constitutional propriety could even contemplate such a scheme. New Labour may balk at trying to carry it through. In the end, the party might prefer the humiliation of failing to reform House of Lords' membership to the outrage of liquidating its powers. But such liquidation would be consistent with the traits to be seen in a political movement which is already in the throes of shifting from inferiority complex to arrogant self-regard, as a product of its impending second election victory.

The so-called education \"reforms\" initiated by the Tories and continued by David Blunkett were carried out in the context of a concerted attack on teachers' competence and values.

My children were at primary school as the Tory underinvestment in schools began to bite and when staff were adjusting to the new demands of SATs. Their school was forced to make cuts.

There was no money for building or repairs and extra activities such as swimming were abandoned. </p> <p>Now at secondary school they are hit by chronic staff shortages. Nationally, the number of unfilled posts in secondary schools rose this month to over 1,200. Anecdotally the situation is known to be far worse. Many teachers are taking subjects for which they are not qualified and there is heavy reliance on \"holiday\" teachers. Australians, New Zealanders and French are the dominant groups. Great. The outcome of all those feverish reforms is the au-pair-isation of education. </p> <p>The government blames low pay and spiralling housing costs, especially in the south-east. But why is teaching disproportionately affected? Many middle-aged teachers who would normally be settled in housing have left the profession. But pay has never been the only issue. Teaching has always been underpaid because it was possible to exploit other motivations - love of a particular subject, enthusiasm to communicate it to the next generation, and the enjoyment of being with young people as they learn. Satisfaction, as in any job, comes when those values are central to the profession as a whole. Self-esteem comes when pupils and society at large endorse those values. </p> <p> But these factors have been systematically marginalised in teaching. Admittedly, social factors played a part in destroying respect from parents. But these pale into insignificance compared with the huge gulf between teachers' core motivational values and what they are being asked to do. Time and again we hear how teachers feel drowned by bureaucracy, by hours spent on form filling, writing out lesson plans, submitting documents for assessments and focusing on endless new initiatives, from SATs, to league tables and performance-related pay. </p> <p>No satisfaction comes from reaching these new targets as most teachers don't think they are worth the paper they are written on. More students may get starred As but teachers think the exams are easier and that the skills required to get such results are to do with fulfilling narrow targets rather than true education. </p> <p>So throwing money at this crisis is not likely to solve it. High salaries won't necessarily tempt teachers back. A new report by the National Association of Head Teachers shows that even with London salaries nudging \u00a3100,000 there's still a dire recruitment crisis. Last year 65% of all jobs had to be re-advertised. Now we hear rumours that the government finally intends to spend money rebuilding and refurbishing old schools. Like Railtrack's overdue track renewals, this will only make things worse in the short term. Good teaching relies on a degree of predictability. </p> <p>Blair and Blunkett's enthusiastic adoption of the Conservatives' educational policies, still rankles with me, in particular their renewing Chris Woodhead's contract. Now that he has departed on his own terms, history is exposing what his critics knew all along: his judgments were as personally motivated and ideological as those of the \"Marxist\" bogeymen he liked to attack. Only last week research showed that media studies degrees are the fifth best for employment. So much for Woodhead's claim that such \"vacuous\" courses do not lead to jobs. </p> <p>Woodhead's values suited Blair and Blunkett's own grim view of education: Gradgrind with a contemporary twist for the classic dual-income working parents who want to weigh and measure their children's achievements as proof that they've done it all right as well as had it all. </p> <p>The only remedy is for this lot to go back to basics - and I don't mean the three Rs at age-appropriate levels.

With the collapse of heavy industry and the high divorce rate, some men argue that they are emasculated and excluded from home and work, forced into what was once the woman's role: second-class citizen. </p> <p>The EOC is using its celebrations to challenge some of this thinking. Aware that equality for women has always required that men, too, should be liberated from the straitjacket of gender stereotyping, it has commissioned research which analyses how far women and men have actually come. Does the traditional breadwinner rest in peace? An increasing number of men under 35 look after their children - it's just that they don't call it childcare. According to one study, 80% of 18-24-year-olds disagree that \"a man's job is to earn the money; a woman's . . . to look after the home and family\". </p> <p>The EOC is calling for a national debate on how to forge a social contract for the 21st century between men and women, employers and employees, government and the electorate. One that draws on notions of modern citizenship and builds on Labour's recognition that childcare and the work-life issue is no longer a private affair but a central part of its economic strategy and a matter of social justice. </p> <p>More persuasive than rhetoric, however, is the clout carried by profit and loss. Put bluntly, the present jalopy of a system - in which the average male works a 47-hour week and the family remains invisible - costs a packet. For instance, days lost to stress alone are estimated to cost British industry\u00a33.8bn per year. </p> <p>At the same time, the rewards of those (few) businesses who are pro-active are obvious. One recent survey of the FTSE-100 companies showed that the quarter who have a 21st-century agenda on discrimination and flexibility had shares which, on average, over a five-year period from 1993, had risen by 141%, compared with the FTSE average of 78%. </p> <p>In spite of this, the pay gap has shifted little since the 80s. It stands at 18% for full-time female employees but a whopping 39% for 5m part-timers. Much attention is paid to the half a million working women (out of 12m) who pay tax at the top whack but, on average, a full-time man earns \u00a321,877, a woman \u00a315,438. </p> <p>\"As a society,\" Mellor says, \"we've accepted equality as part of the wallpaper.

It has just launched an equal pay strategy and what it has already learned about pay scales, Cartmail says, has \"proved a bit of a shock\". Among underwriters and brokers, for instance, full-time women earn 56p for every \u00a31 earned by a man. \"Confidentiality is a requirement of some jobs but we want everybody talking about pay,\" she says. </p> <p> Unequal pay is about cash, job segregation, the low value attached to caring, the part-time penalty, the attitudes of managers and a female tendency to undersell ourselves. As part of its Valuing Women campaign, the EOC demonstrated how prejudice remains alive and well among line managers. Some still see women as less ambitious and committed, so they deny them bonus-related pay. The problem is not helped by the weakness in the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts - it took 14 years for speech therapists to win \u00a312m in back pay. </p> <p>Next month, the EOC's Equal Pay Task Force will publish its report.

The average salary is \u00a315,000, the average age 43; seven out of 10 employees are women and they are expressing their frustration with their feet. Equality and flexibility must be part of the solution. </p> <p>Local authorities say they are unable to fund the the pay gap and Wakefield says the government must. \"If it eliminated discrimination, it would reduce the national pay gap and set the private sector an example.\" Unison's aim at branch level is Educate, Negotiate, Litigate. </p> <p>Of course, in the long term, a critical mass of women entering the workforce is bound to have an impact.

      "bodyText": "Cilla Black's Blind Date has disappeared from TV's top 30, according to official viewing ratings for the past year. Once the linchpin of Saturday night entertainment, the dating game now ranks a lowly 45 in ITV's top 50 programmes for the year, pulling in just 9.6m viewers. Even You've Been Framed - number 29 in the chart - gained a bigger audience, attracting 10m viewers. Blind Date launched 15 years ago and in its heyday was the most talked-about show on television and attracted more than 18m viewers each week. Chris Tarrant's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, talent show Stars in their Eyes, and documentaries on celebrities such as David Beckham have pushed Cilla out of the picture. Cilla's fall from the top of the ratings charts comes just months after she complained about the scheduling of her other show, Moment of Truth. Blind Date aside, ITV is winning the ratings battle with BBC 1. The network screened 24 of the 30 top-rated shows for 2000, according to the latest official figures released by Barb. But in a dramatic end to the year, the BBC's Christmas episode of EastEnders took the number-one slot. The drama surrounding Sonia's baby helped win the soap almost 21m viewers - nearly 2m ahead of Coronation Street, the number two show for the year. The BBC's only other entry in the top 10 was England's battle against Romania in Euro 2000. Last year was also the year reality TV came of age. Yet the programmes are conspicuous by their absence from the top 30 for the year. Big Brother, which scored an impressive 9.5m audience for Channel 4, is the station's number one but it failed to make the all-over charts. Castaway, the BBC's year-long social experiment, doesn't even make it into BBC1's top 30. Docu-soaps also appear to have had their day, with BBC's Airport only just nudging into the top 30 with 10.66m. The only documentary to feature is BBC 1's I Don't Believe It, a programme about the making of One Foot in the Grave, which went out just before the final episode of the sitcom. Although the top 10 is dominated by football, light entertainment and soaps, BBC1's own top 10 features a greater range of shows. Hit comedies such as Dinner Ladies and One Foot in the Grave line up with sport, drama such as Casualty and old reliables like the Antiques Roadshow. Anne Robinson's celebrity version of The Weakest Link made it into BBC 2's top 10. Brookside has been toppled from the top of Channel 4's table by Big Brother, Friends and the Victoria Beckham vehicle, Victoria's Secrets. Channel 5's top 10 is littered with the type of programmes it is best-known for: some news, a little football, a few films and lots of nudity. Keith Chegwin's Naked Jungle, Streakers and the controversial Sex and Shopping all make it to the top 10.",

A Welsh Assembly spokeswoman said the children's commissioner for Wales bill, which gets its second reading today, should extend his remit to protect the interests of all children. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has proposed amendments to strengthen the bill, which it believes may restrict the commissioner's ability to review and investigate child deaths. The charity wants the commissioner to have the power to enter children's institutions and to interview children and adults, to report on the decisions of courts and tribunals and comment on cross-border issues and services. Mary Marsh, director of the NSPCC, said: \"We are concerned that the bill, as it stands, gags the commissioner in a number of areas where his expertise could be very valuable. The government could strengthen the legislation now to ensure that children have a real champion.\" Rob Hutchinson, chairman of the Association of Directors of Social Services' children's and families committee, said children's commissioners needed to be able to influence policy rather than acting as advisers and coordinators. The NSPCC also wants children's commissioners throughout the UK, a proposal backed by the Liberal Democrats, who are set to table an early day motion later this week to propose a child rights commissioner for England. The Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Paul Burstow, said: \"The case for a children's rights commissioner has been made and accepted in Wales. The rest of the country must follow suit. Child abuse does not stop at the border.\" However, a Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"We are not convinced that establishing a commissioner for all children in England will add value to the steps we are already taking to safeguard children.\"",

The difference is that President George no-Dubya Bush actually had a chance to get rid of Saddam, and fluffed it.<br></p> <p><b>How come?</b><br> After the liberation of Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, allied forces poured into Iraq. Saddam's army turned tail and fled, and a popular uprising erupted in most parts of the country. Then Washington got cold feet. Bush and his advisers were terrified that oil-rich Iraq would disintegrate, spreading instability through the region. Specifically, the west feared that the Kurdish minority in the north and the Shia Muslims of the south would secede, leaving a chaotic and rudderless Iraqi rump state in Mesopotamia, the central region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. So Bush ordered the allies to halt, the rebellion was ruthlessly crushed and Saddam lived happily ever after. Until now.<br></p> <p><b>When were the trade sanctions imposed?</b><br> The UN security council approved Resolution 661 on August 6, 1990 - four days after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. The US was faster off the mark, imposing unilateral sanctions within hours of the invasion.<br></p> <p><b>And the no-fly zones?</b><br> After the brief and bloody war, Washington announced that its aircraft would continue to patrol the airspace over the north and south of the country, ostensibly to protect the Kurd and Shia people. Britain, as America's most loyal ally, said it would join in. The patrols, and the periodic strikes against Iraqi military installations, are not sanctioned by the UN.<br></p> <p><b>What were the sanctions and the no-fly zones meant to achieve?</b><br> They were supposed to coerce the Saddam regime into opening up its weapons research establishments to international inspection, thus ensuring that never again would Iraq threaten the region, and indeed the world, with weapons of mass destruction.<br></p> <p><b>Has the strategy worked?</b><br> No. The UN's Unscom inspection project uncovered some evidence of nuclear weapons research, but was frustrated by lack of cooperation. It finally collapsed in 1998, when Saddam refused to allow inspectors access to his many palaces, many of them believed to contain elaborate command-centre bunkers. The despot is now more secure than ever.<br></p> <p><b>What of the effect on the Iraqi people?</b><br> Devastating. The economy is shattered. Hunger is endemic. The UN's own agencies admit that up to 5,300 children are dying every month from disease, malnutrition and related conditions. Altogether, it is thought that more than 500,000 Iraqis have died since 1991 as a consequence of the sanctions and the air strikes. Baghdad puts the figure at 1.5m, or roughly 7.5% of the population.<br></p> <p><b>Has the UN tried to ameliorate the suffering?</b><br> From the start, the west failed to understand the depth of Saddam's disregard for his own people. The embargo always excluded food and medical supplies, and in 1996 the UN approved an oil-for-food scheme, which would have allowed Iraq ample opportunity to pay for essentials. But Saddam balked at the conditions: he was required to pay all his oil earnings into a UN account and 30% was to be siphoned off in war reparations and to cover UN costs.<br></p> <p><b>How has Saddam survived all these years?</b><br> By redoubling the rule of terror, in which the smallest hint of dissent is punishable by death. Also by smuggling on a vast scale, mainly across the border with Jordan.<br></p> <p><b>And now George W Bush is going to sort him out?</b><br> Highly unlikely. He shares his dad's dislike of the Brute of Baghdad - and his concerns for regional stability. But he will step up aid to the main anti-Saddam opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress. Republicans in Congress have already forced a reluctant President Bill Clinton to approve aid to the INC amounting to more than $100m, mostly in military aid, but only a fraction has been spent. The group's cash flow is likely to improve greatly after Saturday.<br></p> <p><b>Won't Bush's advisers rein him in?</b><br> The new president will be surrounded by hawks who share his John Wayne-ish world view. The incoming defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, is noted for his aggressive anti-Saddam views and the new secretary of state is Colin Powell, the former general who commanded the allied forces during Desert Storm and was denied the glory of taking Baghdad.<br></p> <p><b>Is the INC an effective opposition?</b><br> Not in the slightest. Its main activity is windbagging in Washington and other world capitals. It has no known presence inside Iraq, although it boasts that it will establish itself in the Kurdish north - under American protection - as an armed liberation movement.<br></p> <p><b>Will Britain tag along with the new get-tough policy?</b><br> At last there are signs that London is breaking ranks, signalling that it is no longer happy, for example, with the indefinite patrolling of the southern no-fly zone.

The newest terrestrial broadcaster came out last when pay-TV viewers who took part in the ITC survey were asked to rank their eight most watched channels. BBC1 came out top, followed by ITV, BBC2, Channel 4, Sky One, UK Gold, Sky Sports and Channel 5. Just over 2,400 multi-channel homes took part in the survey, Public Service Broadcasting: What Viewers Want, which was conducted last autumn and published today. Official Barb ratings statistics for the week ending Sunday January 7 tell a slightly different story to the ITC's findings. The Barb top-eight ranked services in pay-TV homes - by share of total viewing - are ITV, BBC1, Channel 4, BBC 2, Channel 5, Sky One, UK Gold and Sky Sports One. The ITC survey also found news and drama were regarded as the most important genres for ITV to broadcast, while religious programmes were considered the least important. Children's and regional programming were also seen as important elements of ITV's public service remit. Specialist channels were deemed to be a good thing by 39% of respondents, a figure that rose to 60% among pay-TV subscribers. Three-quarters of pay-TV viewers said they switched between specialist subscription services and free-to-air terrestrial channels to make a varied evening's viewing. The survey results were drawn from 6,166 responses to questionnaires placed on the Barb Quest panel over four weeks from October 9 last year. Out of these, 56% were terrestrial-only viewers, 39% were pay-TV subscribers and 5% were lapsed pay-TV customers.",

      "body": "<p><strong>LAUGHS A GO-GO</strong></p> <p>The Fiver has checked the calendar, but the only place that appears to have a National Media Prank Day is Borneo, and that's on October 32. But for some reason, there has been not one, but two hil-air-ee-ous gags at the expense of football's high and mighty today (well, recently, anyway) and it's the Fiver's dutiful duty to report them.</p> <p>First up is the tale of the local DJ and the lesser-spotted Svennis. Somehow, Mike Maguire of Manchester's Century FM managed to get the England boss's phone number and, posing as esteemed tactician Kelvin Koogan, called him in Italy yesterday afternoon. Ostensibly calling to wish Svennis \"all the best\", the educated Swede probably began to suspect otherwise when his predecessor told him: \"I was in Italy myself. I bought a Pavarotti CD for 30 quid - I wanted three tenors!\"</p> <p>Anyway, the conversation continued in a similar vein until Svennis responded to a question about whether David Beckham would be his England captain with a quick \"I think so\". Not one of the most decisive statements ever, but enough to convince the tabloids that Svennis had been \"done\" and England had a fool on their hands.

      "bodyText": "LAUGHS A GO-GO The Fiver has checked the calendar, but the only place that appears to have a National Media Prank Day is Borneo, and that's on October 32. But for some reason, there has been not one, but two hil-air-ee-ous gags at the expense of football's high and mighty today (well, recently, anyway) and it's the Fiver's dutiful duty to report them. First up is the tale of the local DJ and the lesser-spotted Svennis. Somehow, Mike Maguire of Manchester's Century FM managed to get the England boss's phone number and, posing as esteemed tactician Kelvin Koogan, called him in Italy yesterday afternoon. Ostensibly calling to wish Svennis \"all the best\", the educated Swede probably began to suspect otherwise when his predecessor told him: \"I was in Italy myself. I bought a Pavarotti CD for 30 quid - I wanted three tenors!\" Anyway, the conversation continued in a similar vein until Svennis responded to a question about whether David Beckham would be his England captain with a quick \"I think so\". Not one of the most decisive statements ever, but enough to convince the tabloids that Svennis had been \"done\" and England had a fool on their hands. The Fiver's not quite so sure, but who are we to stand in the way of a good old laugh? Fortunately, the same principle can be applied to a recent interview given to US magazine Stuff 4 Men by Hollywood hunkthrob Vincent Jones.

      "body": "<p>Governments and aid agencies around the world have begun committing millions of dollars to help people injured and displaced by the powerful earthquake that hit El Salvador on Saturday.</p> <p>Officials today raised the confirmed death toll to more than 600, with at least 500 people still missing and feared dead. </p> <p>The country's president, Francisco Flores, said 2,412 people were injured and more than 45,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the magnitude-7.6 quake. </p> <p>In a televised address to the nation Monday night, he said he expected the death toll to rise significantly and that 3,000 coffins would arrive today from Colombia.</p> <p>Unicef said this morning it had committed at least $500,000 (\u00a3350,000) in immediate relief aid, saying the money would be spent on preventing disease and helping to restore a sense of normalcy for children left traumatised and homeless.</p> <p>The British government has pledged \u00a3600,000 in aid, including a flight carrying emergency equipment and an Oxfam team of specialists that will leave for El Salvador tonight.</p> <p>Joost Martens, Oxfam's representative for Latin America, said: \"There's no electricity or water. Clean water is the biggest need at the moment.\" </p> <p>The Norwegian government today increased its aid offer from $800,000 to $1.2m.</p> <p>This morning, workers in the city of Santa Tecla near the capital, San Salvador, continued to bury unidentified bodies in common graves at the municipal cemetery.</p> <p>Hopes are fading of finding any more survivors under the rubble, after a man was pulled from the ruins yesterday after being trapped for 33 hours.</p> <p>Army Major Jose Miranda said the majority of those under the rubble who weren't killed instantly were likely to have already suffocated. But he added: \"They pulled out a body that still had warm blood on it, so anything is possible.\" </p> <p>Although the largest number of deaths appeared to be in Las Colinas, a neighbourhood of Santa Tecla, the quake caused 185 landslides across El Salvador, burying anyone who couldn't get out of the way and blocking hundreds of roads. </p> <p>Police said nearly 18,000 people have been evacuated from dangerous areas. Many are living with relatives or in shelters, and others who still have homes lack basic services. Water service was cut to as many as half of the country's 6m people, the Pan-American Health Organization said. </p> <p>Aftershocks continued to rock the country, knocking more debris onto highways. Many towns were reachable only by helicopter, and little was known about damage or deaths in isolated communities. </p> <p>\"I am totally out on the street,\" Carmelo Lopez, whose house and four family members were buried in a landslide that wiped out a coffee plantation outside San Salvador. \"I am alone.\"</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,422902,00.html\">16.01.2001: Earthquake toll could top 1600</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,422918,00.html\">16.01.2001: Buried alive for 33 hours, a victim pleads: 'Get me out, please hurry'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,422759,00.html\">16.01.2001: Contested property scheme blamed for many deaths</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,422559,00.html\">15.01.2001, George Monbiot: 'We care, but only when we know'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,422321,00.html\">15.01.2001: Damage delays aid as search continues</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,422406,00.html\">15.01.2001: Eyewitness: 'the mountain tumbled down'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,422320,00.html\">15.01.2001: How the earthquake happened</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,422475,00.html\">Gallery: the story in pictures</a></p> <p><strong>Relief appeal</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/atwork/emerg/elsalvador.htm\">Oxfam in El Salvador</a></p> <p><strong>Local media</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.teledos.com/\">Teledos (Spanish)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.laprensa.com.sv/\">La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica (Spanish)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/index.html\">El Diario de Hoy (Spanish)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.elsalvador-magazine.com/\">El Salvador magazine (Spanish)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nacion.co.cr/\">La Naci\u00f3n</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/current/m_america.html\">National earthquake information center: Current seismicity for central America</a><br> <a href=\"http://denali.gsfc.nasa.gov/dtam/\">Digital world tectonic activity map</a><br> <a href=\"http://explorezone.com/earth/earthquakes.htm\">explorezone.com: earthquakes </a><br> <a href=\"http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/bulletin/bulletin.html\">USGS earthquake bulletins</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org/disaster/safety/earth.html\">Are you ready for an earthquake? </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nortropic.com/el_salvador/\">El Salvador: online resources</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Governments and aid agencies around the world have begun committing millions of dollars to help people injured and displaced by the powerful earthquake that hit El Salvador on Saturday. Officials today raised the confirmed death toll to more than 600, with at least 500 people still missing and feared dead. The country's president, Francisco Flores, said 2,412 people were injured and more than 45,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the magnitude-7.6 quake. In a televised address to the nation Monday night, he said he expected the death toll to rise significantly and that 3,000 coffins would arrive today from Colombia. Unicef said this morning it had committed at least $500,000 (\u00a3350,000) in immediate relief aid, saying the money would be spent on preventing disease and helping to restore a sense of normalcy for children left traumatised and homeless. The British government has pledged \u00a3600,000 in aid, including a flight carrying emergency equipment and an Oxfam team of specialists that will leave for El Salvador tonight. Joost Martens, Oxfam's representative for Latin America, said: \"There's no electricity or water. Clean water is the biggest need at the moment.\" The Norwegian government today increased its aid offer from $800,000 to $1.2m. This morning, workers in the city of Santa Tecla near the capital, San Salvador, continued to bury unidentified bodies in common graves at the municipal cemetery. Hopes are fading of finding any more survivors under the rubble, after a man was pulled from the ruins yesterday after being trapped for 33 hours. Army Major Jose Miranda said the majority of those under the rubble who weren't killed instantly were likely to have already suffocated. But he added: \"They pulled out a body that still had warm blood on it, so anything is possible.\" Although the largest number of deaths appeared to be in Las Colinas, a neighbourhood of Santa Tecla, the quake caused 185 landslides across El Salvador, burying anyone who couldn't get out of the way and blocking hundreds of roads. Police said nearly 18,000 people have been evacuated from dangerous areas. Many are living with relatives or in shelters, and others who still have homes lack basic services. Water service was cut to as many as half of the country's 6m people, the Pan-American Health Organization said. Aftershocks continued to rock the country, knocking more debris onto highways. Many towns were reachable only by helicopter, and little was known about damage or deaths in isolated communities. \"I am totally out on the street,\" Carmelo Lopez, whose house and four family members were buried in a landslide that wiped out a coffee plantation outside San Salvador. \"I am alone.\" Related articles 16.01.2001: Earthquake toll could top 1600 16.01.2001: Buried alive for 33 hours, a victim pleads: 'Get me out, please hurry' 16.01.2001: Contested property scheme blamed for many deaths 15.01.2001, George Monbiot: 'We care, but only when we know' 15.01.2001: Damage delays aid as search continues 15.01.2001: Eyewitness: 'the mountain tumbled down' 15.01.2001: How the earthquake happened Gallery: the story in pictures Relief appeal Oxfam in El Salvador Local media Teledos (Spanish) La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica (Spanish) El Diario de Hoy (Spanish) El Salvador magazine (Spanish) La Naci\u00f3n Useful links National earthquake information center: Current seismicity for central America Digital world tectonic activity map explorezone.com: earthquakes USGS earthquake bulletins Are you ready for an earthquake?

A Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said that the settler rampage in Gaza would be high on the agenda. The attacks came after the discovery of Roni Tsalah's body at dawn yesterday.

Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, like the rampage, re-imposed in revenge for the killing, is also likely to be discussed.

Well, almost. </p> <p>Half an hour later I was bleeped back into consciousness with a call to the haematology ward, to stick a drip line in some kid who was having a blood transfusion. Haematology wards are full of people who get transfused their whole lives, and their veins are fibrous and thrombosed by the time the nurses are calling people like me over to cannulate them. </p> <p>This guy looked about 12. \"Hi,\" I said. He looked up from his book like I was the butler. \"How old are you?\" I asked, doing my best to deploy a slightly dishevelled brand of early-morning paediatric bedside friendliness. \"I'm 31, you prick. It's thalassaemia. It makes me look younger.\" Fabulous. \"You'd better get this in first time, you know. The nurses have already fucked up my left arm.\" I smiled: which is what you'd do. \"Jesus Christ,\" he sighed, and started back at his book. </p> <p>I opened up the shrink-wrapped bits of kit I needed to stick a line into his nasty little veins, thinking about (in order): how nice it would be to get back into bed; how amazing it was that I had managed to qualify knowing so little haematology; and how cool it would be if you could buy some kind of magic beam that would morph shitty nurses and patients into beatific angels on sight. </p> <p>So his comment - \"That nurse has got fabulous tits\" - felt like a bit of a turning point in our doctor-patient relationship. I looked up, grinning, but held fast to neutral territory. \"I wouldn't know about that, sir,\" I replied, reaching for my saline flush, and feeling pretty good about getting the line in first time. \"I can't believe you called me sir. You called me sir. You really think I'm 31. You must know fuck all.\" He laughed noisily in the direction of the nursing station to get their attention, with his eyes wide open. \"This doctor knows fuck all! He thinks I'm 31! You fuckwit!\" The patients around us start waking up. I think about making a sharp exit, or at least a sharp remark (or maybe just clouting him), but then remember I'm the doctor. I'd guess it must get pretty boring, being a kid in a hospital.</p>",

He looked up from his book like I was the butler. \"How old are you?\" I asked, doing my best to deploy a slightly dishevelled brand of early-morning paediatric bedside friendliness. \"I'm 31, you prick. It's thalassaemia. It makes me look younger.\" Fabulous. \"You'd better get this in first time, you know. The nurses have already fucked up my left arm.\" I smiled: which is what you'd do. \"Jesus Christ,\" he sighed, and started back at his book. I opened up the shrink-wrapped bits of kit I needed to stick a line into his nasty little veins, thinking about (in order): how nice it would be to get back into bed; how amazing it was that I had managed to qualify knowing so little haematology; and how cool it would be if you could buy some kind of magic beam that would morph shitty nurses and patients into beatific angels on sight. So his comment - \"That nurse has got fabulous tits\" - felt like a bit of a turning point in our doctor-patient relationship. I looked up, grinning, but held fast to neutral territory. \"I wouldn't know about that, sir,\" I replied, reaching for my saline flush, and feeling pretty good about getting the line in first time. \"I can't believe you called me sir. You called me sir. You really think I'm 31. You must know fuck all.\" He laughed noisily in the direction of the nursing station to get their attention, with his eyes wide open. \"This doctor knows fuck all! He thinks I'm 31! You fuckwit!\" The patients around us start waking up. I think about making a sharp exit, or at least a sharp remark (or maybe just clouting him), but then remember I'm the doctor. I'd guess it must get pretty boring, being a kid in a hospital.",

      "body": "<p>Bertha Limacher has never had so many strangers in her home. The BBC have been in, she says, and Meridian, and a number of the papers. She has her treasured photographs to hand, ready to show off. The man from the local paper asks Bertha to lean over the pictures, arms around her husband and daughter, and point at them. He snaps the shutter a couple of times. It is too much for Mr Limacher, who covers his face with his hand and breaks into rasping sobs. </p> <p>It is just over a week since Bertha's daughter Brenda Marshall died. It was a messy, public, deeply distressing death. Early last Friday morning, Bertha found her daughter in bed, moaning. She had been suffering from a bad chest infection and had been complaining for a few days of feeling very unwell; Bertha couldn't rouse her. She called an ambulance, and took her to hospital, 45 minutes from their home on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. </p> <p>They arrived before 7am. Brenda spent much of the morning on a trolley in a corridor outside the X-ray department. The hospital was busy, there were no ward beds available, and the nurses were rushed off their feet. Bertha, who is 76 and disabled, had to get Brenda onto a bed pan, with the help of her grandson's partner, who is pregnant. Finally, at 3.30pm, a ward bed was found for Brenda, almost nine hours after she arrived at the hospital. She slipped into unconsciousness, and died the following evening of pneumonia. She was 52. </p> <p>Brenda Marshall's death has become the latest in a long line of supposed NHS failures. Press reports have implied that if she had been given a bed earlier she might have lived, although the family don't know if they believe this. Their grief is ragged, devastating. But, says Bertha, she always knew she would lose Brenda: she just hoped she wouldn't go before her. </p> <p>Brenda Marshall was born with Down's syndrome, and to her mother and her sister Robina, 45, the sorry manner of her death is the least interesting part of her story. For more than half a century, Bertha has been responsible for every aspect of her daughter's care. Brenda couldn't walk more than a few steps without becoming breathless, could not wash or dress herself, and had to use a commode during the night. In her last few years she needed help in the toilet. As Bertha herself became more aged and less able, the needs of her daughter became more demanding. \"I tried to treat her like an adult,\" says her mother, \"but it was like caring for a baby for 52 years.\" </p> <p>Down's syndrome is not a disease from which people can be said to \"suffer\". It is, rather, a genetic abnormality, in which babies are born with an extra chromosome. Those with the condition are prone to a number of illnesses, including heart problems, difficulties with hearing and vision, and thyroid disease. Their experiences, however, can vary enormously. Many people with Down's syndrome live very full and independent lives, holding down jobs and sustaining relationships. Others require much more intensive care. </p> <p>Bertha was 24 when Brenda was born in 1949, at her home in west London. She was her first child, and Bertha didn't know much about babies, she says, but she knew something was wrong. \"She was a bit funny, she used to go blue, and it would take me hours to feed her. I don't know if she couldn't suck, or what.\" She took the baby to her doctor, who referred her to Great Ormond Street hospital for tests. \"They turned round and said that she was a 'mongol'. They called them mongols in those days. And of course I didn't know what a mongol was. I came out crying my eyes out.\" </p> <p>The hospital, she says, offered no explanation as to what was wrong with her baby, or the kind of difficulties she could expect. \"They just said to me, 'Do you want to put her away, or do you want to keep her?' And I said, 'Good God, I wouldn't want her put away!' So they just sent me away from the hospital.\" </p> <p>Brenda started to walk when she was three, copying her younger brother. After a few steps, however, she would have to crouch down to regain her breath. When Brenda was six or seven, Bertha's mother bought her granddaughter a wheelchair. \"She said, 'You can't let her go about like that,'\" says Bertha. \"Mum paid for the wheelchair. Nobody else helped. I had no support. Nothing at all.\" </p> <p>At the age of 10, Brenda started at a special school for people with learning disabilities. \"She loved it,\" says Robina. \"She used to go in fancy dress. They tried to teach the children to read and write, but Brenda wasn't able. But she loved books all her life. She collected books about Diana, and she had some horse books; she loved them.\" Then, when Brenda was 13, Bertha was given the first detailed information about the nature of her health problems. Brenda had a series of tests that established that she had a hole in her heart which, doctors said, was inoperable. All of her teeth were also removed, something which was once not unusual with people with the condition. Bertha was told that her daughter could expect to live no more than six years. </p> <p>From there their lives settled into a pattern that was both extraordinary and utterly mundane. From the day she left school at 16, Brenda attended a series of day centres for people with Down's syndrome. She was a very placid person, says her mother, and lived a happy life, \"as far as we know\". Brenda had a boyfriend, Gordon Robins, when she was in her late teens. \"He used to come to the house,\" says Bertha. \"She wanted to get married and have children. He actually asked me if he could marry her, and I said, 'I don't think so, darling.'\" </p> <p>Bertha feels that at the time she was the only one who could provide properly for her. \"Brenda couldn't do anything,\" she says. \"She couldn't walk far, and she couldn't cook or anything like that. She couldn't open a tin of baked beans. She couldn't read or write, she just managed to write her own name, and then towards the end she couldn't even do that.\" </p> <p>Bertha had cared for her father until he died, then when her mother became too unwell to cope with her large London house, the whole family moved to a bungalow in Sheppey. Her mother was alive until five years ago. \"I used to go to work; I used to clean. I had to work to make ends meet.\" But she could only take jobs that allowed her to be at home while Brenda was home. She could never leave her on her own. More than once, Brenda's heart stopped completely. \"A couple of times, not just recently, she actually died in front of us and [my husband] massaged her heart and got it going again.\" It happened if Brenda got very agitated or upset. Deaths, in particular, upset her. </p> <p>There is increasing evidence, as the general care for people with Down's syndrome improves, that they may be more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, from as young as 30. Brenda had always prided herself on remembering everyone in the family's birthday, including those of all of Robina's 10 children. But in her last years, she started to forget simple things like the day of the week, or would get confused as to which room was which. Bertha could no longer cope on her own, and had to have someone in to wash and dress Brenda; someone to do her hair, someone to look after her feet. It was arranged through the social services, but the cost was met by the family. It was only in the last few months, when Brenda started at a new day centre, that she was allocated a one-to-one carer. </p> <p>Brenda Marshall's family were not trained in the latest, politically correct, ways to look after people with Down's syndrome. No one thought to tell them. Had their daughter been born a few decades later, she might well have been able to attend a mainstream school. Brenda would have had support from a health visitor as she was growing up, and she would probably have been referred to an educational psychologist, a social worker and a psychologist. Brenda might well have been able to have lived independently in sheltered accommodation; she might have married. </p> <p>Brenda's story illustrates how far things have come in the way we treat people with learning disabilities. And yet there is still some way to go. A recent report from the Down's Syndrome Association said 28% of parents of a child with the syndrome felt their child had been discriminated against in terms of health care. </p> <p>But there's no doubt that Brenda was lucky: her family loved her fiercely and was instinctively hostile to anything that diminished her individuality.

      "bodyText": "Bertha Limacher has never had so many strangers in her home. The BBC have been in, she says, and Meridian, and a number of the papers. She has her treasured photographs to hand, ready to show off. The man from the local paper asks Bertha to lean over the pictures, arms around her husband and daughter, and point at them. He snaps the shutter a couple of times. It is too much for Mr Limacher, who covers his face with his hand and breaks into rasping sobs. It is just over a week since Bertha's daughter Brenda Marshall died. It was a messy, public, deeply distressing death. Early last Friday morning, Bertha found her daughter in bed, moaning. She had been suffering from a bad chest infection and had been complaining for a few days of feeling very unwell; Bertha couldn't rouse her. She called an ambulance, and took her to hospital, 45 minutes from their home on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. They arrived before 7am. Brenda spent much of the morning on a trolley in a corridor outside the X-ray department. The hospital was busy, there were no ward beds available, and the nurses were rushed off their feet. Bertha, who is 76 and disabled, had to get Brenda onto a bed pan, with the help of her grandson's partner, who is pregnant. Finally, at 3.30pm, a ward bed was found for Brenda, almost nine hours after she arrived at the hospital. She slipped into unconsciousness, and died the following evening of pneumonia. She was 52. Brenda Marshall's death has become the latest in a long line of supposed NHS failures. Press reports have implied that if she had been given a bed earlier she might have lived, although the family don't know if they believe this. Their grief is ragged, devastating. But, says Bertha, she always knew she would lose Brenda: she just hoped she wouldn't go before her. Brenda Marshall was born with Down's syndrome, and to her mother and her sister Robina, 45, the sorry manner of her death is the least interesting part of her story. For more than half a century, Bertha has been responsible for every aspect of her daughter's care. Brenda couldn't walk more than a few steps without becoming breathless, could not wash or dress herself, and had to use a commode during the night. In her last few years she needed help in the toilet. As Bertha herself became more aged and less able, the needs of her daughter became more demanding. \"I tried to treat her like an adult,\" says her mother, \"but it was like caring for a baby for 52 years.\" Down's syndrome is not a disease from which people can be said to \"suffer\". It is, rather, a genetic abnormality, in which babies are born with an extra chromosome. Those with the condition are prone to a number of illnesses, including heart problems, difficulties with hearing and vision, and thyroid disease. Their experiences, however, can vary enormously. Many people with Down's syndrome live very full and independent lives, holding down jobs and sustaining relationships. Others require much more intensive care. Bertha was 24 when Brenda was born in 1949, at her home in west London. She was her first child, and Bertha didn't know much about babies, she says, but she knew something was wrong. \"She was a bit funny, she used to go blue, and it would take me hours to feed her. I don't know if she couldn't suck, or what.\" She took the baby to her doctor, who referred her to Great Ormond Street hospital for tests. \"They turned round and said that she was a 'mongol'. They called them mongols in those days. And of course I didn't know what a mongol was. I came out crying my eyes out.\" The hospital, she says, offered no explanation as to what was wrong with her baby, or the kind of difficulties she could expect. \"They just said to me, 'Do you want to put her away, or do you want to keep her?' And I said, 'Good God, I wouldn't want her put away!' So they just sent me away from the hospital.\" Brenda started to walk when she was three, copying her younger brother. After a few steps, however, she would have to crouch down to regain her breath. When Brenda was six or seven, Bertha's mother bought her granddaughter a wheelchair. \"She said, 'You can't let her go about like that,'\" says Bertha. \"Mum paid for the wheelchair. Nobody else helped. I had no support. Nothing at all.\" At the age of 10, Brenda started at a special school for people with learning disabilities. \"She loved it,\" says Robina. \"She used to go in fancy dress. They tried to teach the children to read and write, but Brenda wasn't able. But she loved books all her life. She collected books about Diana, and she had some horse books; she loved them.\" Then, when Brenda was 13, Bertha was given the first detailed information about the nature of her health problems. Brenda had a series of tests that established that she had a hole in her heart which, doctors said, was inoperable. All of her teeth were also removed, something which was once not unusual with people with the condition. Bertha was told that her daughter could expect to live no more than six years. From there their lives settled into a pattern that was both extraordinary and utterly mundane. From the day she left school at 16, Brenda attended a series of day centres for people with Down's syndrome. She was a very placid person, says her mother, and lived a happy life, \"as far as we know\". Brenda had a boyfriend, Gordon Robins, when she was in her late teens. \"He used to come to the house,\" says Bertha. \"She wanted to get married and have children. He actually asked me if he could marry her, and I said, 'I don't think so, darling.'\" Bertha feels that at the time she was the only one who could provide properly for her. \"Brenda couldn't do anything,\" she says. \"She couldn't walk far, and she couldn't cook or anything like that. She couldn't open a tin of baked beans. She couldn't read or write, she just managed to write her own name, and then towards the end she couldn't even do that.\" Bertha had cared for her father until he died, then when her mother became too unwell to cope with her large London house, the whole family moved to a bungalow in Sheppey. Her mother was alive until five years ago. \"I used to go to work; I used to clean. I had to work to make ends meet.\" But she could only take jobs that allowed her to be at home while Brenda was home. She could never leave her on her own. More than once, Brenda's heart stopped completely. \"A couple of times, not just recently, she actually died in front of us and [my husband] massaged her heart and got it going again.\" It happened if Brenda got very agitated or upset. Deaths, in particular, upset her. There is increasing evidence, as the general care for people with Down's syndrome improves, that they may be more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, from as young as 30. Brenda had always prided herself on remembering everyone in the family's birthday, including those of all of Robina's 10 children. But in her last years, she started to forget simple things like the day of the week, or would get confused as to which room was which. Bertha could no longer cope on her own, and had to have someone in to wash and dress Brenda; someone to do her hair, someone to look after her feet. It was arranged through the social services, but the cost was met by the family. It was only in the last few months, when Brenda started at a new day centre, that she was allocated a one-to-one carer. Brenda Marshall's family were not trained in the latest, politically correct, ways to look after people with Down's syndrome. No one thought to tell them. Had their daughter been born a few decades later, she might well have been able to attend a mainstream school. Brenda would have had support from a health visitor as she was growing up, and she would probably have been referred to an educational psychologist, a social worker and a psychologist. Brenda might well have been able to have lived independently in sheltered accommodation; she might have married. Brenda's story illustrates how far things have come in the way we treat people with learning disabilities. And yet there is still some way to go. A recent report from the Down's Syndrome Association said 28% of parents of a child with the syndrome felt their child had been discriminated against in terms of health care. But there's no doubt that Brenda was lucky: her family loved her fiercely and was instinctively hostile to anything that diminished her individuality. Healthcare professionals had talked to the family about different \"classifications\" of Down's syndrome. \"They used to be As, Bs and Cs,\" says Robina, \"the As were the best.\" Brenda, they were told, was an A. \"But they are not a number. They have all got a name. They are all individuals. Brenda said to me once, 'I'm not the different one, you are.' As far as Brenda was concerned, all her friends were Down's syndrome; we were the odd ones out.\" After spending the best part of her life as a carer, Bertha feels utterly lost without Brenda. She doesn't know what she'll do with her daughter's porcelain dolls; she doesn't want to give her books to a library in case they are destroyed. \"I find at the moment I can have a longer lie in bed,\" she attempts to joke. Her voice cracks. \"I used to have to get up at half past five; this morning I didn't get up until nine o'clock.\"",

If I leave it to gather, as my wife says I should, my ears hurt and I get progressively more deaf. When the wax build up becomes unbearable, the practice nurse syringes them for me.

Using a hearing aid, earplugs or cotton buds will all tend to push wax further into the ear. Syringing is offered by most GP surgeries but there is no evidence that it does more good than harm. I love syringing ears and was distressed to learn that I may be causing ear irritation, dizziness, perforated eardrums, pain and tinnitus. Fancier methods of wax removal involving microscopes, probes, suction and forceps are usually only available in hospital ENT departments and are similarly unproven. Wax softening drops all seem to work fairly well with fewer side effects than syringing. Nearly a third of wax-blocked ears will clear themselves within five days if left alone. </p> <p><strong> I can't stop him crying</strong><br> </p> <p>Q: My three-month-old baby is happy and playful all day. At six in the evening, he starts crying and doesn't stop until we all fall asleep exhausted at around midnight. He's putting on weight and has been seen by my GP, health visitor and a paediatrician, all of whom say he's fine! I'm resigned to the fact that it's colic but am worn out, fed up and at my wits' end every evening. Any suggestions? </p> <p>A: Babies grow out of colic by the age of five months, but parents and carers may take much longer to recover from the strain and sleeplessness. Any baby can get colic, which is defined as crying that lasts over three hours at least three times a week in an otherwise healthy baby. Experts don't know what causes colic - some say it's just that some babies cry more than others and it's no more abnormal than babies who happen to cry very little. That can't be much comfort to parents who are unlucky enough to give birth to the noisier end of the standard distribution curve. Other possibilities are that your baby has painful gut contractions, gas or lactose intolerance. Soya milk instead of cow's milk formula helps some babies but cutting out dairy products such as fromage frais hasn't been shown to make much difference. Anti-colic drug dicyclomine can be helpful but once you read the potential side effects (constipation, diarrhoea and, rarely, breathing difficulties, seizures and even coma) you're unlikely to give it regularly if at all. Old fashioned sugar solution was soothing in one trial and a herbal tea containing camomile, vervain, licorice, fennel and balm mint was even better. It may help to stimulate your baby less with less winding, jiggling and lifting. Driving him round in the car, carrying him round all day and giving him a dummy probably won't help. Baby massage, cranial osteopathy and homeopathy may help to soothe you and, hopefully, your baby. </p> <p> <strong> Marfan's syndrome </strong></p> <p> Q: My sister died of heart disease when she was young and we were told many years later that she had Marfan's syndrome. Is this inherited and do I need to worry? </p> <p> A:You don't necessarily need to worry but you do need some expert help from a specialist. Marfan's syndrome is a genetic condition in which the connective tissue of the body, which is an important structural component in all organs, is abnormally weak and elastic. Marfan's is rare, affecting about 1 in 10,000 people, and can be mild or cause serious problems such as your sister had. Most people with Marfan's syndrome live full lives with few restrictions. People with Marfan's syndrome are characteristically tall, slim, have long and spindly fingers and toes and are often \"double jointed\". The main problem can arise in the heart with leaky valves and widening of the aorta, which can tear and cause sudden and early death. An examination, tests on the heart and genetic tests are wise for all members of the family as early diagnosis can help to control complications. For more information contact the Marfan Association, 6 Queens Rd, Farnborough, Hants GU14 6DH (01252-810472). </p> <p>These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

What is the point of continuing with sanctions and what could they be replaced by?</p> <p>The Iraqi leadership is treating the tenth anniversary as if Baghdad had won the war, with a \"victory\" speech by president Saddam Hussein planned.</p> <p>Given that Iraq was forced out of Kuwait and suffered terrible losses to its army, this defiance seems misplaced.</p> <p>But neither Iraq's military defeat nor the ensuing economic sanctions have diminished Saddam, who has emerged over the last six months as strong as he has ever been.</p> <p>The UN sanctions, pursued enthusiastically now only by the US and Britain, are chaotic. The alliance of Western and Arab countries that supported their imposition a decade ago has broken down.</p> <p>Sanctions-busting by fellow Arab countries, as well as Russia and France, has become so commonplace that it no longer makes news.</p> <p>The land borders too have become so porous that Iraqis with money can get almost anything they want. Lowly Iraqi officials, even in small towns, have access to the latest computers, supposedly on the list of banned goods.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, in a press statement to coincide with the anniversary of the outbreak of the war, said: \"It is high time to revisit the sanctions policy against Iraq.</p> <p>\"If British companies are already in negotiations for lucrative contracts [*reference needs explaining - today's story in the paper], then the days of wholesale sanctions are clearly numbered.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office and, in particular, the minister of state, Peter Hain, are touchy about any suggestion that the sanctions policy might have failed or that they are conducting a review of the policy. They fear that any changes will be seen as weakness.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said that there was a widespread misapprehension about the purpose of sanctions. Many believe they were imposed to topple Saddam and, by that measurement, sanctions had obviously failed.</p> <p>But the spokesman insisted that the purpose was containment and that the sanctions had been successful in preventing Saddam from rebuilding his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>The sanctions policy has already undergone changes.

      "bodyText": "A fundamental review of sanctions against Iraq is under way in London and Washington, 10 years after they were imposed at the start of the Gulf war. The sanctions have been criticised by many - including United Nations staff who worked in Baghdad - for their appalling impact on the civilian population. But they are also becoming increasingly irrelevant, ignored by neighbouring countries. Two questions now need answering. What is the point of continuing with sanctions and what could they be replaced by? The Iraqi leadership is treating the tenth anniversary as if Baghdad had won the war, with a \"victory\" speech by president Saddam Hussein planned. Given that Iraq was forced out of Kuwait and suffered terrible losses to its army, this defiance seems misplaced. But neither Iraq's military defeat nor the ensuing economic sanctions have diminished Saddam, who has emerged over the last six months as strong as he has ever been. The UN sanctions, pursued enthusiastically now only by the US and Britain, are chaotic. The alliance of Western and Arab countries that supported their imposition a decade ago has broken down. Sanctions-busting by fellow Arab countries, as well as Russia and France, has become so commonplace that it no longer makes news. The land borders too have become so porous that Iraqis with money can get almost anything they want. Lowly Iraqi officials, even in small towns, have access to the latest computers, supposedly on the list of banned goods. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, Menzies Campbell, in a press statement to coincide with the anniversary of the outbreak of the war, said: \"It is high time to revisit the sanctions policy against Iraq. \"If British companies are already in negotiations for lucrative contracts [*reference needs explaining - today's story in the paper], then the days of wholesale sanctions are clearly numbered.\" The Foreign Office and, in particular, the minister of state, Peter Hain, are touchy about any suggestion that the sanctions policy might have failed or that they are conducting a review of the policy. They fear that any changes will be seen as weakness. A Foreign Office spokesman said that there was a widespread misapprehension about the purpose of sanctions. Many believe they were imposed to topple Saddam and, by that measurement, sanctions had obviously failed. But the spokesman insisted that the purpose was containment and that the sanctions had been successful in preventing Saddam from rebuilding his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. The sanctions policy has already undergone changes. The sanctions no longer cover absolutely everything and, over the last few years, more consideration has been given to the humanitarian concerns, freeing up Iraqi oil revenue for food. What further changes take place depends on the new US administration of George W Bush. The Foreign Office likes to maintain the fiction that its policies are independent of the US and, in some areas they are, such as re-establishing links with countries including Iran and Libya. However, over Iraq, the Foreign Office is waiting to see what the US administration comes up with. The Foreign Office is putting forward a number of proposals to Washington, including an end to the US and British bombing of Iraq's southern border and a shift in emphasis in sanctions to more specific targets, such as a ban on military equipment. The present buzzword for this selective approach is \"smart\" sanctions. Mr Bush is likely to opt for a tougher approach to Iraq than Bill Clinton. He comes with a lot of baggage: it was his father who prosecuted the war and his secretary of state, Colin Powell, who led the anti-Iraq alliance. In the meantime, Saddam has become stronger, mainly as a result of the hostility in Arab countries towards Israel since the start of the Palestinian uprising in September. It is a time for Arabs to unite, even with Saddam. The policy of sanctions towards Iraq is busted, but the US and Britain still have to work out an alternative approach. Engagement with the rest of the world, encouraging Iraqis to travel and have access to the world's media, seems like a sensible way of undermining the regime, but neither Washington nor London appears enamoured of that route. The US and Britain see Saddam as a danger to the Middle East and the world in general, and they will try to keep him contained. The policy might change but that objective will remain the same. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, is due to hold talks with Baghdad in February to discuss ways of ending UN sanctions by allowing UN weapons inspectors back into Iraq. In the past, Saddam has always opposed the return of the weapons inspectors. He may be more inclined to accept them now, as he would be agreeing from a position not of weakness but of strength. If this happened, sanctions would be lifted within months.

A spokeswoman for the hospital said the chapel of rest was used because the hospital's temporary mortuary, designed to be used when the mortuary was full, was broken. </p> <p>She said it was used on a number of days last week and up to eight bodies were laid out in the chapel, none for more than 24 hours. </p> <p>Mr Houghton said: \"It appears that this has happened on rare occasions in the past when the mortuary was full.\" </p> <p>He said Department of Health guidance insisted that patients should be treated \"with respect and dignity\" and \"that was certainly not the case at the hospital last week\". He said: \"On this occasion, despite having a temporary mortuary available, bodies were stored on the floor in totally inappropriate conditions. </p> <p>\"The reason the additional temporary facility was not being used was because of problems with the doors, not because there were no places available. This problem had caused a porter to injure himself. </p> <p>\"No policies or procedures for dealing with a full mortuary were in place. The decision and the reasons behind it were not raised with senior management of the hospital.\"</p>",

It is not their fault and it not just a problem of money. The money is there but it is a question of priorities.\" He added: \"The problem is that managers are not being able to spend the money in the way they want. \"The government forces the managers to spend the money on political initiatives such as the waiting list initiative, rather than on improving pathology facilities. \"We see pathology as a priority but Mr Milburn [health secretary] would rather it was spent on treating non-urgent cases within 18 months. We would rather see the money spent on people already in our care, whether dead or alive, than on people who are yet to be treated.\" Shadow health secretary Dr Liam Fox called for an independent inquiry into the incident. He said: \"The resignation of the chief executive does not remove the need for an independent inquiry. \"We have evidence that these practices have been going on for at least three years and that there are major management problems in this hospital which require detailed investigation \"Any such investigation must be completely independent, with outside bodies scrutinising all aspects of the direction of management and any political interference in clinical priorities and the treatment of patients. \"This is given fresh impetus by the revelations of Dr Rawlins, who indicated that funding was available for better mortuary facilities but it was being diverted into the government's waiting list initiative to satisfy Tony Blair's demands.\" Mr Williams was not available for comment last night. A spokeswoman for the hospital said the chapel of rest was used because the hospital's temporary mortuary, designed to be used when the mortuary was full, was broken. She said it was used on a number of days last week and up to eight bodies were laid out in the chapel, none for more than 24 hours. Mr Houghton said: \"It appears that this has happened on rare occasions in the past when the mortuary was full.\" He said Department of Health guidance insisted that patients should be treated \"with respect and dignity\" and \"that was certainly not the case at the hospital last week\". He said: \"On this occasion, despite having a temporary mortuary available, bodies were stored on the floor in totally inappropriate conditions. \"The reason the additional temporary facility was not being used was because of problems with the doors, not because there were no places available. This problem had caused a porter to injure himself. \"No policies or procedures for dealing with a full mortuary were in place. The decision and the reasons behind it were not raised with senior management of the hospital.\"",

      "bodyText": "Christian Dailly is to join West Ham, manager Harry Redknapp has revealed - just hours after claiming the player was about to sign for Everton. Leicester had also been chasing the Scottish international defender, but after spending four days mulling over his decision, Dailly has finally decided to go to Upton Park in a \u00a31.75m deal. Redknapp told Sky Sports.com TV: \"He's going to come to West Ham. I'm very pleased - he's a good player and a Scottish international. \"There was talk of Leicester and Everton being interested and I just left it to the lad. I let him make his own decision in his own time. I think the other offers were the same as ours so it was just a football decision. \"We have spent \u00a35m of the Rio Ferdinand money [\u00a318m] and got three players with that, and I think we now have a better squad.\" But earlier today Harry Redknapp was in much more melancholy mood, telling the official West Ham website that Dailly would choose Everton as his new club. \"There's no good news at all,\" he told them. \"It looks like Dailly is going elsewhere, to Everton, which was always a possibility as it's nearer home for him. \"It's amazing how suddenly Everton and Leicester appeared after it became news that we were going to buy him. But what can you do, you know? You've just got to get on with it and see what happens.\" Dailly, who joined Blackburn from Derby in a \u00a35.3m deal in 1998, looks likely to make his first appearance for West Ham against Charlton on Monday night.",

In 1999, the last full year in German ownership, Rover, including Land Rover which is now part of Ford, lost some \u00a3840m.

The \"performance gap\" will have to be closed by trading. </p> <p>From 2004 MG Rover has to start repaying some of the around \u00a3500m interest-free loan given by BMW to the 4-man consortium that bought the group, valued at \u00a3749m, for a nominal \u00a310 last year. </p> <p>The loan paid in instalments does not become due until 2049 but, if Rover becomes profitable, it will, in 3 years, pay \u00a325m or 25% of its annual earnings - whichever is the lesser amount - to BMW. </p> <p>Rover also stands to gain more money from the Bavar ian-based group when agreement is reached on its entire assets and liabilities. But Mr Howe said that the group needed no external financing as it had ended last year with more cash than when it started. Output of the R25 and R45 will remain constant at 2,600 a week but that of the R75, the upmarket model, will rise from the current 600 to 945 in March and 1,200 in September. </p> <p>The key decision on Rover's future - how to design and fund a new \u00a3250-\u00a3300m medium-sized car to replace the R25 and R45 series - will be taken in the first half of 2001, with production planned for 2004. Rover is said to be seeking a collaboration agreement with Malaysia's Proton car company, to produce a new platform (basic frame of chassis and engine compartment) - and win economies of scale from common components. </p> <p>But Mr Howe said this was only one of four options and indicated a strong preference for \"going it alone\". \"It is the best front-wheeled platform in the world and designed to spawn other products. We could probably shorten it and develop an excellent medium car off it,\" he said. \"Early art designs show it looks great and is technologically great.\" </p> <p>Another option would be to develop it with a supplier but Mr Howe said: \"We could develop that ourselves. And our business cost planning assumes we pay for everything ourselves.\" Rover now employs just under 5,500 and could hire more labour later this year. </p> <p>\u0095Unions at Vauxhall are planning a ballot on industrial action at the decision to end car production at Luton with the loss of 2,200 jobs.

Rover is said to be seeking a collaboration agreement with Malaysia's Proton car company, to produce a new platform (basic frame of chassis and engine compartment) - and win economies of scale from common components. But Mr Howe said this was only one of four options and indicated a strong preference for \"going it alone\". \"It is the best front-wheeled platform in the world and designed to spawn other products. We could probably shorten it and develop an excellent medium car off it,\" he said. \"Early art designs show it looks great and is technologically great.\" Another option would be to develop it with a supplier but Mr Howe said: \"We could develop that ourselves. And our business cost planning assumes we pay for everything ourselves.\" Rover now employs just under 5,500 and could hire more labour later this year. \u0095Unions at Vauxhall are planning a ballot on industrial action at the decision to end car production at Luton with the loss of 2,200 jobs. Conciliatory talks with General Motors senior executives in Zurich yesterday were fruitless.",

      "body": "<p>The movement for a fully comprehensive school system was being launched. \"Youth culture\" was said to be ruling Britain. The Boy's Own Paper folded and the pill became available on prescription, even to the unmarried. There were student sit-ins throughout the country and a massive Legalise Pot demonstration in Hyde Park. A controversial and outspoken teacher called Rhodes Boyson was set to take over the headship of the newly formed comprehensive Highbury Grove. Tony and Caroline Benn, redesigning themselves, were moving their children from Westminster preparatory school to Holland Park comprehensive. A report by the Comprehensive Schools Committee was to recommend that all direct grant schools be integrated into the comprehensive system. It was a time of immense educational change. Yet all of these changes - from the arrangement of the classes to the colour of the pencils - were being instituted by those who would never be taught at the establishments themselves. Adults. </p> <p>This was the background against which, in November 1967, The Observer launched a competition called The School I'd Like. It was a radical idea in a revolutionary age. Young people were being asked to dream of, then design, their perfect school. The users of the system, not the controllers, were being consulted. </p> <p>It was the heady late 60s, and the pupils were as idealistic as the era. They wanted to abolish exams and bells. They wanted to be able to dedicate themselves to a single piece of work for a whole week if it was important. Some said all teachers were to be retired before they grew too old, a suggested maximum age limit being 33, \"so they would be in a position to advise on modern problems should a pupil require it\". Literature teachers should be poets, geography teachers explorers, history teachers political activists. Relevance was everything: maths should be about income tax. </p> <p>A 14-year-old from Manchester said, \"Mrs McCormick would not tell us to read The Formation of a Cave, Chapter 22. Instead we would be taken to the Peak District and visit caves.\" And they almost all, without exception, wanted a fully comprehensive education system. A rebellious 17-year-old wrote: \"Comprehensives without rules and streams and exams. Comprehensives with laughter and learning and communication. That's what I want, man. But it costs bread and that's needed for our next nuclear submarines.\" They were against all kinds of segregation, whether by sex, class or ability. </p> <p>Their entries, almost 1,000, arrived in all forms - poems, plays, drawings, architectural plans, photo-essays, and an adolescent's thoughts: \"Don't get panarchy, I don't want anarchy, Just sympathy, For the pimply.\" </p> <p>Amongst these diverse entries was one by John Clifford, 17 years old and a boarding pupil at Clifton College, Bristol. \"I hated my school. It was horrible, built on bullying, conformity and violence with a Christian gloss on it. So the competition was very important to me,\" he remembers. \"I never told anyone at the school. It was about self-expression, self-affirmation. I was dreaming of being a writer, and had no self-confidence. My writing wasn't encouraged at school. It was immensely important that my writing get some sort of affirmation from outside.\" John Clifford was a winner in the 1967 School I'd Like. Now aged 50, he is an established playwright and lecturer in the drama department at Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh. </p> <p>Two years after the competition, in 1969, Penguin published a book of extracts from the entries, edited by Edward Blishen, a pioneer of the comprehensive system. A couple of years ago, Dr Ian Grosvenor, an historian at the School of Education at Birmingham University, came across a copy of this out-of-print paperback in a secondhand bookstore. He was intrigued. Together with a colleague, Catherine Burke, a lecturer at the School of Education at Bretton Hall College, they set up a discussion forum on the web about pupil input to school design. From this initiative, the Guardian has decided to run a second competition, a generation after the first, to give pupils a voice once more in their education. Using any form to express themselves - from digital imagery and videos to old-fashioned pen and ink - young people will again be able to design The School I'd Like. In 1967, the first prize was \u00a325. Today, the winner will receive \u00a310,000 worth of computer equipment for their school. </p> <p> Apart from the prize, has anything actually changed since the first competition? \"The institution of schooling changes less than other institutions,\" says Catherine Burke. \"If someone fell asleep on an operating table 100 years ago and woke up now, they wouldn't recognise where they were. But if someone fell asleep at their school desk 100 years ago and woke up now, they'd see exactly the same elements. The blackboard, the desks, the person with all the knowledge at the front, children arranged in groups of age... In spite of all the experimentation, it has remained the same.\" </p> <p>This competition is a chance for young people themselves to propose changes for the coming century. It is no easier a challenge than it was over 30 years ago. \"At that time there was an element of experimentation in teaching, and teachers were more free to organise their teaching how they wanted during the day,\" says Burke. \"Kids also have changed. They've been trained to see their schooling in a particular way. They ask things like, 'How would the competition benefit us? How will we fit it in?' Yet at the same time we have a government saying that it's important to have more democracy and participation in schools.\" </p> <p>We hear much mumbling about the need to involve pupils in the educational process under schemes such as school councils. But a recent survey of over 2,000 school students by the Institute of Education showed that simply introducing a token council can increase children's scepticism. The forums for listening are still few and far between. \"When we have the whole debate around education, which we do continually, we always ask the parents, we always consult the teachers' unions, we ask businesses. We still haven't got to the stage where the voice of the consumer, the person being processed, is actually heard,\" says Peter Facey, chief executive of the British Youth Council. \"Some school councils are doing a good job at an individual school level. That's fine for micro changes. But when we're talking about fundamental changes affecting all school pupils, then they're not involved. </p> <p>\"There's nobody who can say, 'I'm a school pupil, I've been elected by my peers, and I can say x, y, z... And that's a big gap. We need a mechanism to consult on the major changes that affect every pupil.\" </p> <p>Burke predicts that, in an atmosphere where pupil involvement occurs at this local level, there will be fewer proposals for grand schemes than in the first competition and more calls for small, incremental changes. \"Pupils today are very interested in small details, such as the chairs. They wished their chairs were shaped in a different way and made more comfortable.\" The physical environment was also important to the original 1967 entrants and, with such a large stock of Victorian school buildings, probably still will be. There were pleas for trees, colours, comfort, common rooms and soundproofing. The physical and mental were considered inextricable from each other. \"No engraved desks, arranged in ranks, or uniforms. How could you bear the drabness? Didn't you care that each child was an echo of his neighbour?\" wrote 14-year-old Melanie. </p> <p>Chris Watkins, a reader at the Institute of Education, paints a gloomy picture of the future of education from the pupil's perspective. He believes we fail to listen at our peril. \"Much of the research on how you get higher achievements points to what the kids said in 1967 - more time for important work, and more pupil control. Yet everything has gone completely in the opposite direction to what the kids wanted,\" he said. The entrants of the 1967 competition clearly came out against exams. Yet they have not gone away, but become even more entrenched. The continued emphasis on results has led to a warping of educational priorities. </p> <p>\"The kids think they do the learning for their teachers nowadays, so they get good results for the school, not for themselves,\" he said. Watkins was recently sent to assess a new London secondary school. New schools are a rare opportunity to include pupil opinion from the outset, but it's an opportunity that is rarely taken up. \"They had whiteboards instead of blackboards. Bells have been replaced, but simply by electronic buzzers, known as The Pips. It's just a Victorian model of learning dressed up as something else,\" says Watkins. </p> <p>There is one way in which more children's views are being taken into account in this competition. In 1967, the competition was only open to secondary school pupils. This School I'd Like is open to every child. \"The decision to ask the primary school child to comment on their schooling and voice their concerns, hopes, feelings and ideas for change comes as a natural today,\" says Burke. </p> <p>But are we really ready to listen to all children? Peter Facey hopes so. \"A school is never going to be run by pupils. We're not suggesting a revolution,\" he says. \"But when we discuss standards, exams, the changes in education, there should be some attempt to involve pupils. They affect them more than they affect anybody else. There needs to be a change of attitude so that pupils have an active say in what's happening to them.\" </p> <p>This second The School I'd Like competition is giving young people this chance. Perhaps, this time, we'll listen. </p> <p><strong> What you could win</strong><br> </p> <p> Each winner will receive three Toshiba laptops, with back packs to carry them in, along with a digital camera and a projector, and a selection of compatible Microsoft software for their school. The total value of each prize is around \u00a310,000. The runners-up will win digital cameras for their schools. </p> <p> <strong>How to enter </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>Are you a pupil?</strong></p> <p>Is your school just as you want it to be? Or are there things you would change? Is the building right? Should you sit exams? Are you allowed to express yourself? Are uniforms a good thing? If there are things about your school you would like to change, here's your chance. Our competition is open to every pupil between the ages of five and 18. You can enter as an individual: simply complete our entry form (email <a href=\"mailto:education@theguardian.com\"> education@theguardian.com</a> with 'The School I'd Like' in the subject field) and send it with your entry to the freepost address provided by the closing date (Friday March 30). </p> <p> Your entry can take any form. Simply tell us what your ideal school would be like, and tell us any way you like - write a poem or a play; paint a picture; make architectural plans or even a scale model; produce photo-essays, or a video. Or simply write an essay in good old pen and ink. A short poem can make the point as well as a huge project; an icon can be as emotive as a three-act play. What we are looking for is originality, imagination, vision and - above all - the genuine views of children and young people.</p> <p><strong>Are you a teacher?</strong></p> <p> We realise that teachers don't have much time to do work with children that falls outside the national curriculum. The beauty of The School I'd Like is that teachers can adapt it to suit their needs. </p> <p> The opportunities for English, art or DT teachers are perhaps the most obvious. An English teacher could ask pupils for a poem or a piece of persuasive or polemical writing, a DT teacher could ask pupils to build a scale model, for example or draw a plan. But the competition also supports many other elements of the national curriculum: knowledge and understanding of places for geography key stage 2, for example, or developing skills of participation for citizenship at key stage 3. </p> <p> You can think big, or think small. Pupils could be set the task as a one-off piece of homework (you could then submit the work of all the pupils in the class, or simply send us the best responses - either way, our judges will look at each piece of work as an individual entry, so ask pupils to write their name on the top of their work). Or you could be more ambitious. You could get a whole class to collaborate on a collective entry (if you do this, remember to ask one of the children to include a description of how this was accomplished). </p> <p> What we are looking for is originality, imagination, vision and - above all - the genuine views of children and young people. By taking part, you and your pupils will be contributing to a new archive that is being set up at Bretton Hall College of the University of Leeds. All work submitted will be kept there and used as a basis for research. So even if your pupils do not win, their views will be heard and will remain as a record for future educationalists.</p> <p><strong>Are you a parent?</strong></p> <p>You could encourage your own child(ren) to enter as an individual (see Are you a pupil? above). The prize will be awarded to their school. </p> <p> <strong>The categories</strong></p> <p>The competition is open to all children and young people aged five to 18. There are three categories: primary (years 1 to 6); lower secondary (years 7 to 9 inclusive); and upper secondary (years 10 to 13 inclusive). Multiple entries can be submitted using one entry form (see Are you a teacher, above) but each category entered must be accompanied by a separate entry form. Entries must reach us by the closing date.</p> <p><strong>The judges</strong></p> <p> The judges of The School I'd Like competition are: Tim Brighouse, Director of Education for Birmingham Education Authority; Lee Hall, writer of the hit film, Billy Elliott; Richard Lomer, head of government sales, Toshiba; Catherine Burke, lecturer in education, Bretton Hall College, University of Leeds; Becky Gardiner, editor of Education Guardian; and John Clifford, playwright and winner of the original 1967 Observer School I'd Like competition. </p> <p> <strong>What next?</strong></p> <p> Now it's up to you. What do you think school should be like? How could it be better? What would you do differently? You can think big, you can think small. Whatever your ideas are, start talking, start planning, and then get to work. When your entry is ready, send it in to the freepost address provided below, accompanied by an entry form. If you are sending in multiple entries (eg, you are a teacher sending in individual entries from every member of your class) you only need to complete one entry form per category. And remember too that your entries need to be with us by Friday, March 30, 2001.</p> <p>You can also order more forms by email - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/eventsandoffers/article/0,5992,422564,00.html\">click here for more details</a>. If you do, you <strong>must</strong> include your full postal address.</p> <p> If you would like to discuss The School I'd Like competition with anyone, you can email Catherine Burke at: <a href=\"mailto:cburke@bretton.ac.uk\"> cburke@bretton.ac.uk</a>.</p> <p> We regret that your entries cannot be returned. They will remain the property of the Guardian and will be kept as an archive at Bretton Hall College of the University of Leeds. The details of winners and runners-up will be published in Education Guardian on Tuesday May 22, 2001.</p>",

A controversial and outspoken teacher called Rhodes Boyson was set to take over the headship of the newly formed comprehensive Highbury Grove. Tony and Caroline Benn, redesigning themselves, were moving their children from Westminster preparatory school to Holland Park comprehensive. A report by the Comprehensive Schools Committee was to recommend that all direct grant schools be integrated into the comprehensive system. It was a time of immense educational change. Yet all of these changes - from the arrangement of the classes to the colour of the pencils - were being instituted by those who would never be taught at the establishments themselves. Adults. This was the background against which, in November 1967, The Observer launched a competition called The School I'd Like. It was a radical idea in a revolutionary age. Young people were being asked to dream of, then design, their perfect school. The users of the system, not the controllers, were being consulted. It was the heady late 60s, and the pupils were as idealistic as the era. They wanted to abolish exams and bells. They wanted to be able to dedicate themselves to a single piece of work for a whole week if it was important. Some said all teachers were to be retired before they grew too old, a suggested maximum age limit being 33, \"so they would be in a position to advise on modern problems should a pupil require it\". Literature teachers should be poets, geography teachers explorers, history teachers political activists. Relevance was everything: maths should be about income tax. A 14-year-old from Manchester said, \"Mrs McCormick would not tell us to read The Formation of a Cave, Chapter 22. Instead we would be taken to the Peak District and visit caves.\" And they almost all, without exception, wanted a fully comprehensive education system. A rebellious 17-year-old wrote: \"Comprehensives without rules and streams and exams. Comprehensives with laughter and learning and communication. That's what I want, man. But it costs bread and that's needed for our next nuclear submarines.\" They were against all kinds of segregation, whether by sex, class or ability. Their entries, almost 1,000, arrived in all forms - poems, plays, drawings, architectural plans, photo-essays, and an adolescent's thoughts: \"Don't get panarchy, I don't want anarchy, Just sympathy, For the pimply.\" Amongst these diverse entries was one by John Clifford, 17 years old and a boarding pupil at Clifton College, Bristol. \"I hated my school. It was horrible, built on bullying, conformity and violence with a Christian gloss on it. So the competition was very important to me,\" he remembers. \"I never told anyone at the school. It was about self-expression, self-affirmation. I was dreaming of being a writer, and had no self-confidence. My writing wasn't encouraged at school. It was immensely important that my writing get some sort of affirmation from outside.\" John Clifford was a winner in the 1967 School I'd Like. Now aged 50, he is an established playwright and lecturer in the drama department at Queen Margaret University College in Edinburgh. Two years after the competition, in 1969, Penguin published a book of extracts from the entries, edited by Edward Blishen, a pioneer of the comprehensive system. A couple of years ago, Dr Ian Grosvenor, an historian at the School of Education at Birmingham University, came across a copy of this out-of-print paperback in a secondhand bookstore. He was intrigued. Together with a colleague, Catherine Burke, a lecturer at the School of Education at Bretton Hall College, they set up a discussion forum on the web about pupil input to school design. From this initiative, the Guardian has decided to run a second competition, a generation after the first, to give pupils a voice once more in their education. Using any form to express themselves - from digital imagery and videos to old-fashioned pen and ink - young people will again be able to design The School I'd Like. In 1967, the first prize was \u00a325. Today, the winner will receive \u00a310,000 worth of computer equipment for their school. Apart from the prize, has anything actually changed since the first competition? \"The institution of schooling changes less than other institutions,\" says Catherine Burke. \"If someone fell asleep on an operating table 100 years ago and woke up now, they wouldn't recognise where they were. But if someone fell asleep at their school desk 100 years ago and woke up now, they'd see exactly the same elements. The blackboard, the desks, the person with all the knowledge at the front, children arranged in groups of age... In spite of all the experimentation, it has remained the same.\" This competition is a chance for young people themselves to propose changes for the coming century. It is no easier a challenge than it was over 30 years ago. \"At that time there was an element of experimentation in teaching, and teachers were more free to organise their teaching how they wanted during the day,\" says Burke. \"Kids also have changed. They've been trained to see their schooling in a particular way. They ask things like, 'How would the competition benefit us? How will we fit it in?' Yet at the same time we have a government saying that it's important to have more democracy and participation in schools.\" We hear much mumbling about the need to involve pupils in the educational process under schemes such as school councils. But a recent survey of over 2,000 school students by the Institute of Education showed that simply introducing a token council can increase children's scepticism. The forums for listening are still few and far between. \"When we have the whole debate around education, which we do continually, we always ask the parents, we always consult the teachers' unions, we ask businesses. We still haven't got to the stage where the voice of the consumer, the person being processed, is actually heard,\" says Peter Facey, chief executive of the British Youth Council. \"Some school councils are doing a good job at an individual school level. That's fine for micro changes. But when we're talking about fundamental changes affecting all school pupils, then they're not involved. \"There's nobody who can say, 'I'm a school pupil, I've been elected by my peers, and I can say x, y, z... And that's a big gap. We need a mechanism to consult on the major changes that affect every pupil.\" Burke predicts that, in an atmosphere where pupil involvement occurs at this local level, there will be fewer proposals for grand schemes than in the first competition and more calls for small, incremental changes. \"Pupils today are very interested in small details, such as the chairs. They wished their chairs were shaped in a different way and made more comfortable.\" The physical environment was also important to the original 1967 entrants and, with such a large stock of Victorian school buildings, probably still will be. There were pleas for trees, colours, comfort, common rooms and soundproofing. The physical and mental were considered inextricable from each other. \"No engraved desks, arranged in ranks, or uniforms. How could you bear the drabness? Didn't you care that each child was an echo of his neighbour?\" wrote 14-year-old Melanie. Chris Watkins, a reader at the Institute of Education, paints a gloomy picture of the future of education from the pupil's perspective. He believes we fail to listen at our peril. \"Much of the research on how you get higher achievements points to what the kids said in 1967 - more time for important work, and more pupil control. Yet everything has gone completely in the opposite direction to what the kids wanted,\" he said. The entrants of the 1967 competition clearly came out against exams. Yet they have not gone away, but become even more entrenched. The continued emphasis on results has led to a warping of educational priorities. \"The kids think they do the learning for their teachers nowadays, so they get good results for the school, not for themselves,\" he said. Watkins was recently sent to assess a new London secondary school. New schools are a rare opportunity to include pupil opinion from the outset, but it's an opportunity that is rarely taken up. \"They had whiteboards instead of blackboards. Bells have been replaced, but simply by electronic buzzers, known as The Pips. It's just a Victorian model of learning dressed up as something else,\" says Watkins. There is one way in which more children's views are being taken into account in this competition. In 1967, the competition was only open to secondary school pupils. This School I'd Like is open to every child. \"The decision to ask the primary school child to comment on their schooling and voice their concerns, hopes, feelings and ideas for change comes as a natural today,\" says Burke. But are we really ready to listen to all children? Peter Facey hopes so. \"A school is never going to be run by pupils. We're not suggesting a revolution,\" he says. \"But when we discuss standards, exams, the changes in education, there should be some attempt to involve pupils. They affect them more than they affect anybody else. There needs to be a change of attitude so that pupils have an active say in what's happening to them.\" This second The School I'd Like competition is giving young people this chance. Perhaps, this time, we'll listen. What you could win Each winner will receive three Toshiba laptops, with back packs to carry them in, along with a digital camera and a projector, and a selection of compatible Microsoft software for their school. The total value of each prize is around \u00a310,000. The runners-up will win digital cameras for their schools. How to enter Are you a pupil? Is your school just as you want it to be? Or are there things you would change? Is the building right? Should you sit exams? Are you allowed to express yourself? Are uniforms a good thing? If there are things about your school you would like to change, here's your chance. Our competition is open to every pupil between the ages of five and 18. You can enter as an individual: simply complete our entry form (email education@theguardian.com with 'The School I'd Like' in the subject field) and send it with your entry to the freepost address provided by the closing date (Friday March 30). Your entry can take any form. Simply tell us what your ideal school would be like, and tell us any way you like - write a poem or a play; paint a picture; make architectural plans or even a scale model; produce photo-essays, or a video. Or simply write an essay in good old pen and ink. A short poem can make the point as well as a huge project; an icon can be as emotive as a three-act play. What we are looking for is originality, imagination, vision and - above all - the genuine views of children and young people. Are you a teacher? We realise that teachers don't have much time to do work with children that falls outside the national curriculum. The beauty of The School I'd Like is that teachers can adapt it to suit their needs. The opportunities for English, art or DT teachers are perhaps the most obvious. An English teacher could ask pupils for a poem or a piece of persuasive or polemical writing, a DT teacher could ask pupils to build a scale model, for example or draw a plan. But the competition also supports many other elements of the national curriculum: knowledge and understanding of places for geography key stage 2, for example, or developing skills of participation for citizenship at key stage 3. You can think big, or think small. Pupils could be set the task as a one-off piece of homework (you could then submit the work of all the pupils in the class, or simply send us the best responses - either way, our judges will look at each piece of work as an individual entry, so ask pupils to write their name on the top of their work). Or you could be more ambitious. You could get a whole class to collaborate on a collective entry (if you do this, remember to ask one of the children to include a description of how this was accomplished). What we are looking for is originality, imagination, vision and - above all - the genuine views of children and young people. By taking part, you and your pupils will be contributing to a new archive that is being set up at Bretton Hall College of the University of Leeds. All work submitted will be kept there and used as a basis for research. So even if your pupils do not win, their views will be heard and will remain as a record for future educationalists. Are you a parent? You could encourage your own child(ren) to enter as an individual (see Are you a pupil? above). The prize will be awarded to their school. The categories The competition is open to all children and young people aged five to 18. There are three categories: primary (years 1 to 6); lower secondary (years 7 to 9 inclusive); and upper secondary (years 10 to 13 inclusive). Multiple entries can be submitted using one entry form (see Are you a teacher, above) but each category entered must be accompanied by a separate entry form. Entries must reach us by the closing date. The judges The judges of The School I'd Like competition are: Tim Brighouse, Director of Education for Birmingham Education Authority; Lee Hall, writer of the hit film, Billy Elliott; Richard Lomer, head of government sales, Toshiba; Catherine Burke, lecturer in education, Bretton Hall College, University of Leeds; Becky Gardiner, editor of Education Guardian; and John Clifford, playwright and winner of the original 1967 Observer School I'd Like competition. What next? Now it's up to you. What do you think school should be like? How could it be better? What would you do differently? You can think big, you can think small. Whatever your ideas are, start talking, start planning, and then get to work. When your entry is ready, send it in to the freepost address provided below, accompanied by an entry form. If you are sending in multiple entries (eg, you are a teacher sending in individual entries from every member of your class) you only need to complete one entry form per category. And remember too that your entries need to be with us by Friday, March 30, 2001. You can also order more forms by email - click here for more details. If you do, you must include your full postal address. If you would like to discuss The School I'd Like competition with anyone, you can email Catherine Burke at: cburke@bretton.ac.uk. We regret that your entries cannot be returned. They will remain the property of the Guardian and will be kept as an archive at Bretton Hall College of the University of Leeds. The details of winners and runners-up will be published in Education Guardian on Tuesday May 22, 2001.",

The Home Office confirmed that, although overall crime fell slightly, by 0.2%, in the 12 months to September 2000, there was a worrying rise in assaults and muggings. Overall violent crime rose by 8%, with robbery rising by 21%, but the violent crime rise is half that of the year before, when it was 16%. Four of the eight metropolitan forces in England and Wales recorded overall falls, but their success was outweighed by increases in Greater Manchester (up 1.7%), Merseyside (up 2.4%), the Met (up 3%) and West Midlands (up 3.2%). London's Metropolitan police force recorded the highest number of robberies in the country at 5.6 robberies for every 1,000 residents. The West Midlands police followed with 4.1 offences per 1,000 residents, followed by Greater Manchester at 3.7%. Central Newcastle had the highest number of incidents of violence against the person, with 236.5 for every 1,000 residents. Despite the increase in violent crime, the home secretary, Jack Straw, labelled the statistics \"encouraging\". He placed particular emphasis on the fall in recorded burglary and vehicle crime.

      "bodyText": "The number of black officers in the Metropolitan Police is significantly lower than first thought, after police wrongly tried to claim that white Irish officers were an ethnic minority, it emerged today. The Home Office said that it was \"deeply concerned\" about a series of errors made by police in the collation of national statistics. The most notable error was the figure released on the supposed increases in ethnic minority officers working in England and Wales. Paul Wiles, director of research development of statistics at the Home Office, said that the Metropolitan Police had originally said that the number of ethnic officers working for the force had increased by 218 between March and September 2000. In fact, the increase was just four, Mr Wiles said. The mistake was made because officers classified as \"white Irish\" and \"other white\", such as people from Australia, were included in the total of ethnic minority officers. Mr Wiles said: \"I am deeply concerned about these errors. This has been a cock-up.\" He said that a special task force was now been created, including Home Office statisticians, to ensure that the problem did not happen again. As a result of the blunder, the accurate figure for ethnic minority officers in September 30 2000 was 2,856, 3.6% higher than in March 2000 and not as previously published at 11.4% higher. Home secretary Jack Straw also expressed his concern about the misleading police figures. He said: \"I am concerned whenever the figures generated by ourselves or by someone else on our behalf are inaccurate. \"However, there's no evidence that there was any attempt to mislead the public.\" Police also made errors when publishing figures on the total number of officers working for the service. The actual number of officers at the end of September was 124,614 and not 124,163 as originally published. Mr Wiles said that this meant that, instead of a national drop of seven officers between March and September 2000 there was an increase of 444 across England and Wales. \"Therefore, police numbers nationally are going up and not down,\" Mr Wiles said. The difference in the statistics was due to an error made by Metropolitan Police in collating figures as a number of force boundary changes were made.

Two years ago the commission ordered football to change its transfer system. </p> <p> <strong> Why is football so concerned?</strong> </p> <p> Football believes that this could lead to anarchy within the game. There would be no stability as players could walk out on contracts. Clubs in turn could terminate the players' contracts. Small clubs could go bankrupt and they would not earn money from developing young players because those players could terminate a contract and join another club. Players' wages, particularly those at the top end of the game, would spiral out of control. </p> <p> <strong> What was football's response?</strong> </p> <p> For two years virtually nothing. Then last summer Sepp Blatter, the president of Fifa, announced that the transfer system was dead and that the organisation would comply with the commission. This incensed Uefa, which fears that, if the commission gets its way, then professional football as we know it will collapse. A joint Fifa/Uefa working party on the transfer system was established and a number of proposals submitted to the commission. </p> <p> <strong> What are those proposals?</strong> </p> <p> A ban on transfers for players aged 18 or under. Players to honour contracts for a specified period of time but Fifa and the commission and Uefa disagree over how long this should be. An arbitration system to be established that would compensate clubs when a player wants to break a contract unilaterally. </p> <p> <strong> What is the latest row between Fifa and Uefa about?</strong> </p> <p> After spending several months trying to forge a united front Fifa last week submitted a document on the transfer system to the European Commission without consulting Uefa. Fifa wanted to give players the right to terminate contracts at three months' notice simply because they disagree with team selection or strategy. Uefa believes that clubs and players need greater stability and contracts must be honoured for between three to five years. </p> <p> <strong> What was Uefa's response?</strong> </p> <p> Very angry. There were rumours of a possible breakaway from Fifa. Uefa is the richest and most influential football federation in the world and believes that Fifa has acted in an unprincipled manner by submitting a document to the commission without consultation. Uefa insists that Fifa withdraw the document and that a new set of proposals be submitted. </p> <p> <strong> What was Fifa's response?</strong> </p> <p> Fifa insists that its document does not contain concrete proposals and that it was just meant for discussion. </p> <p> <strong> What else concerns Uefa about the commission's plans?</strong> </p> <p> Apart from length of contract, Uefa also believes that a better compensation system needs to be worked out for players who move clubs. Uefa wants a system to take into account a player's commercial worth, not just the time remaining on his contract and the number of appearances, as the commission and Fifa want. Uefa argues that David Beckham, for example, is worth a lot more to Manchester United in terms of his commercial value to the club. This should be taken into account when settling compensation. </p> <p> <strong> What does the commission say?</strong> </p> <p> The commission appears pleased with Fifa's proposals but not so happy with Uefa, claiming that many of its ideas still contravene European law. The commission insists it is concerned only with international transfers and that domestic transfers will not be affected. Privately Uefa believes that, as with the Bosman ruling, any change will inevitably affect domestic deals. The commission has promised to resolve the matter by the end of the month. </p> <p> <strong> How will the new transfer system work?</strong> </p> <p> A player will have the right to terminate his contract following a specified period of notice. If there is any disagreement the matter will go to arbitration, where compensation will be worked out. Players will have to stay at their club for a specified period of time. </p> <p> <strong> What happens next?</strong> </p> <p> The commission could impose the changes on football but this appears unlikely, given that it would be extremely unpopular. If Fifa insists that its document should be accepted, then this could lead to a split within world football with Uefa breaking away. Political leaders including Tony Blair are also becoming interested in the issue and sport might be given special status exempting it from European law. Uefa's executive committee is to discuss the matter this week and meetings are also planned with Fifa to try to resolve the issue. </p> <p> <strong> In the future will there still be transfer fees?</strong> </p> <p> Yes, but not as high as they currently are. Clubs will not want to pay multi-million-pound fees for players who will have the right to walk out on contracts following a specified period of notice. </p> <p> <strong> How much will players be paid?</strong> </p> <p> Salaries of over \u00a3100,000 a week will be common. The money clubs save on transfers will be diverted towards higher wages as a way of keeping star players.

Various heavy-hitters from the film and music industries will be in town for celebration parties leading up to the inauguration of George W Bush on January 20.</p> <p>Despite the public smiles, however, it appears that the cosy relationship between Hollywood and the White House that flourished during the Clinton era is now well and truly kaput. The motion picture industry was a favoured whipping boy throughout the 2000 presidential race, with Congress threatening to legislate against film advertising which it was claimed was targeted at an underage audience. </p> <p>While Hollywood came in for criticism from both the Republicans and the Democrats (in the person of vice presidential hopeful Joe Lieberman), it is generally thought that Bush's incoming administration, more to the right than observers predicted, will wage more of a moral crusade against mainstream entertainment.</p> <p>On the West Coast, top producer Jerry Weintraub (Ocean's Eleven, The Avengers) has been rallying support for a united Hollywood welcome for Bush, who is a long-time friend. But Tinsletown's representation in Washington still appears limited to die-hard Republicans.

      "bodyText": "Hollywood looks set for an uneasy truce with the incoming Republican administration this week as the ire of a heated election campaign subsides into the inevitable victory celebrations in Washington DC. Various heavy-hitters from the film and music industries will be in town for celebration parties leading up to the inauguration of George W Bush on January 20. Despite the public smiles, however, it appears that the cosy relationship between Hollywood and the White House that flourished during the Clinton era is now well and truly kaput. The motion picture industry was a favoured whipping boy throughout the 2000 presidential race, with Congress threatening to legislate against film advertising which it was claimed was targeted at an underage audience. While Hollywood came in for criticism from both the Republicans and the Democrats (in the person of vice presidential hopeful Joe Lieberman), it is generally thought that Bush's incoming administration, more to the right than observers predicted, will wage more of a moral crusade against mainstream entertainment. On the West Coast, top producer Jerry Weintraub (Ocean's Eleven, The Avengers) has been rallying support for a united Hollywood welcome for Bush, who is a long-time friend. But Tinsletown's representation in Washington still appears limited to die-hard Republicans. Due to welcome Bush at the exclusive Texas Black Tie and Boot Ball at the Marriott Wardman Hotel this Thursday are a rash of old troopers, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Robert Duvall and Sylvester Stallone.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch will axe more internet jobs at his News Corporation empire as he attempts to get the mammoth Sky Global Networks flotation off the ground. Online staff at UK satellite broadcaster BSkyB are the next in line, according to reports in the Financial Times. Murdoch has spent \u00a31.3 bn on internet projects since mid-1999 but decided at a crunch budget meeting last summer that online projects were no longer a priority in the face of a looming debt crisis. \"The company is looking everywhere for cash. The financial people are being very diligent, looking under every rock for money,\" said one senior NewsCorp executive. Another executive at the budget meeting in News Corp's LA offices said: \"It was a pivotal moment when we saw the hockey stick model for the internet business was not going to happen. \"We had all been brought back down to earth a fair bit.\" Mr Murdoch has already shown the door to 200 staff at his News Digital Media arm as he tries to restore investor confidence ahead of the \u00a327bn Sky Global share offer. The NewsCorp chief has ordered a clampdown on acquisitions to conserve cash resources. Last month debt monitors Standard &amp; Poor's threatened to downgrade News Corporation to junk bond status. Such a rating would saddle the group with crippling interest payments on its loans and jeopardise the imminent flotation of his global TV empire. The flotation of NewsCorp's digital broadcast businesses has been delayed in part by a combination of market turbulence and uncertainty over the company's shareholder structure. However, the missing key to a successful float is a strong presence in the US satellite TV market. Mr Murdoch aims to solve that problem by snapping up DirecTV from owner General Motors. News Corporation has embarked on a ruthless purging of its internet ventures to cut costs and help fund the DirecTV acquisition, which would go a long way to pushing Sky Global onto the market. Acquisition activity has already been capped by Mr Murdoch. Mr Murdoch's executives have denied the about-turn in internet strategy is linked to cost-cutting.",

He had crawled into the collapsed building to cut some of the cement blocks weighing on Mr Moreno's body. \"I tried to give him energy, encouragement, telling him that soon it would be all over,\" he said. </p> <p>The two men passed almost 10 hours together underground, until at last Mr Moreno was dragged free, 33 hours after the giant earthquake which hit El Salvador on Saturday. </p> <p>\"I was amazed by his strength, his will to survive, to live; it gave us all energy to carry on,\" Mr Espejelo said. </p> <p>But early yesterday morning, as Mr Espejelo and other rescue specialists from Spain, Mexico and Guatemala were back digging for more survivors, Mr Moreno was fighting for his life in an intensive care unit in a hospital in the capital, San Salvador. </p> <p>\"It is a miracle that he survived all those hours under the earth - but now he is in a very critical condition,\" said a senior surgeon, Dr Eduardo Castillo. </p> <p>Dr Castillo said it had been necessary to amputate Mr Moreno's left leg, and the survivor might have to undergo further surgery to amputate the lower part of his right leg. The pianist's parents, Juan Cruz and Leticia del Carmen, wept as the doctor asked them for permission to carry out the operation. </p> <p>\"All we can do is commend our son to God, and into your hands,\" Ms del Carmen told the doctors. </p> <p><strong>Determination</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Moreno's fate has become a symbol of the tragedy of El Salvador's worse natural disaster in almost 20 years - and a symbol of the determination of Salvadoreans to overcome one more in a long line of adversities - civil war, hurricanes, earthquakes - which have marked the tiny country's recent history. </p> <p>Police said last night that 594 deaths had been confirmed throughout the country. Two thousand people had been injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Most of the 1,000 people still missing were residents of Las Colinas, six miles east of San Salvador. </p> <p>With rescuers giving up hope of finding any more survivors, the authorities continued the mass burials, saying the identities of many who died might never be known. There are no refrigeration facilities and bodies have been piled up in an alley near the quake-triggered landslide which covered Las Colinas. </p> <p>With aftershocks as strong as 5.4 on the Richter scale rattling the unstable mass of soil and rubble, there was no safe place to keep the bodies. </p> <p>Some corpses lay on the pavement as if the victims had lain down for a nap. Some were covered in garbage bags. President Francisco Flores asked Colombia to send 3,000 coffins. </p> <p>One of the handful to be rescued, Mr Moreno had been painting his newly rented two-storey cement-block home in Las Colinas when the quake struck. He had just returned from living in the United States, where, like many of his compatriots, he earned money to send back to his parents in El Salvador. </p> <p>A talented pianist, he toured with a Tex-Mex band called Algodun, a favourite among the expat community in the US.

      "bodyText": "Each time the earth trembled, Sergio Moreno let out a cry of distress and pleaded with rescue workers to set him free. \"Get me out, please hurry, I cannot breathe,\" the 22-year-old musician, his legs pinned down by the weight of fallen overhead beams, begged Mexican rescue worker Jose Alfredo Espejelo. Mr Espejelo lay close to him inside the cramped shell of a destroyed house, under 10ft of thick mud. He had crawled into the collapsed building to cut some of the cement blocks weighing on Mr Moreno's body. \"I tried to give him energy, encouragement, telling him that soon it would be all over,\" he said. The two men passed almost 10 hours together underground, until at last Mr Moreno was dragged free, 33 hours after the giant earthquake which hit El Salvador on Saturday. \"I was amazed by his strength, his will to survive, to live; it gave us all energy to carry on,\" Mr Espejelo said. But early yesterday morning, as Mr Espejelo and other rescue specialists from Spain, Mexico and Guatemala were back digging for more survivors, Mr Moreno was fighting for his life in an intensive care unit in a hospital in the capital, San Salvador. \"It is a miracle that he survived all those hours under the earth - but now he is in a very critical condition,\" said a senior surgeon, Dr Eduardo Castillo. Dr Castillo said it had been necessary to amputate Mr Moreno's left leg, and the survivor might have to undergo further surgery to amputate the lower part of his right leg. The pianist's parents, Juan Cruz and Leticia del Carmen, wept as the doctor asked them for permission to carry out the operation. \"All we can do is commend our son to God, and into your hands,\" Ms del Carmen told the doctors. Determination Mr Moreno's fate has become a symbol of the tragedy of El Salvador's worse natural disaster in almost 20 years - and a symbol of the determination of Salvadoreans to overcome one more in a long line of adversities - civil war, hurricanes, earthquakes - which have marked the tiny country's recent history. Police said last night that 594 deaths had been confirmed throughout the country. Two thousand people had been injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Most of the 1,000 people still missing were residents of Las Colinas, six miles east of San Salvador. With rescuers giving up hope of finding any more survivors, the authorities continued the mass burials, saying the identities of many who died might never be known. There are no refrigeration facilities and bodies have been piled up in an alley near the quake-triggered landslide which covered Las Colinas. With aftershocks as strong as 5.4 on the Richter scale rattling the unstable mass of soil and rubble, there was no safe place to keep the bodies. Some corpses lay on the pavement as if the victims had lain down for a nap. Some were covered in garbage bags. President Francisco Flores asked Colombia to send 3,000 coffins. One of the handful to be rescued, Mr Moreno had been painting his newly rented two-storey cement-block home in Las Colinas when the quake struck. He had just returned from living in the United States, where, like many of his compatriots, he earned money to send back to his parents in El Salvador. A talented pianist, he toured with a Tex-Mex band called Algodun, a favourite among the expat community in the US. After moving back to San Salvador, he planned to study computing at university. Mr Moreno's cousin, Miguel Angel Rivera, was helping him to do up the house on Saturday morning, but left to buy more paint from a local store. \"I told him, I'll be back soon; I'll come back later to help you some more,\" he said. As Mr Rivera turned the corner the first waves of the 7.6 magnitude quake triggered the mudslide from the giant Cordillera mountain range. It swept through the lively middle-class community, uprooting trees, dragging debris along in its path, and laying waste to more than 400 houses. By last night rescue workers had pulled more than 200 bodies out of the remains of Las Colinas. Sniffer dogs were searching for traces of life beneath the mud - although emergency services workers fear that their effort will be in vain. The 300-square metre disaster area is now littered with scraps of clothing, piles of debris, sheets of unread newspapers, and the twisted iron of crushed vehicles. The site where Mr Moreno's house stood is still cordoned off, and has not been touched since the young man was dragged to safety late on Sunday night, unconscious and bleeding heavily. Mr Espejelo said: \"It is a wonderful experience rescuing someone - but this is all very, very hard.\" Related articles 16.01.2001: Earthquake toll could top 1,600 16.01.2001: contested property scheme blamed for many deaths Comment by George Monbiot Gallery: the story in pictures 15.01.2001: Damage delays aid as search continues 15.01.2001: Eyewitness: 'the mountain tumbled down' 15.01.2001: How the earthquake happened Relief appeal Oxfam in El Salvador Local media Teledos (Spanish) La Prensa Gr\u0087fica (Spanish) El Diario de Hoy (Spanish) El Salvador magazine (Spanish) La Naci-n Useful links Digital world tectonic activity map explorezone.com: earthquakes USGS earthquake bulletins Are you ready for an earthquake?

Mr Young said scripts were still being commissioned for the fourth weekly episode of the soap. He added that the extra instalment would launch after Easter, which falls in mid-April this year. \"We've got to get it right,\" he said. \"The quality of the show has to be retained, as well as the quality of the people's working lives.\" ITV Network Centre planners are understood to have been working on the assumption that the fourth weekly EastEnders could launch as early as the beginning of March. Mr Young said he had been planning for the introduction of the new episode for 14 months. One of the key decisions has been to retain a five-day working week, so that the cast and crew still get their weekends off, he added. \"The idea is that they work their socks off till Friday, then get their weekends.\" Barbara Windsor, who plays Mitchell family matriarch Peggy in the soap, said the cast had thought the show might go to five days a week and was \"pleasantly surprised\" that it was only four. Ms Windsor added that the actors were \"very pleased\" about the move, especially because some had been \"worried about having to work every Saturday and Sunday\". \"We like our weekends off,\" she said. A number of other changes will be introduced in order to allow the extra episode to be shot between Monday and Friday. Mr Young said eight to 10 new characters would be introduced to help fill the extra 30 minutes a week. In addition, existing characters - including the Slater family, who were introduced last year with one eye on the launch of a fourth episode - will be used more. \"This gives us the ability to make sure everyone has really good storylines and a good crack of the whip,\" added Mr Young. EastEnders will also take over studio C at Elstree on a permanent basis, displacing Top of the Tops, which is moving to a new base elsewhere. Added to the soap's existing home in Elstree's studio D and stage one, this will allow the production team to have a bigger choice of sets. Mr Young said the EastEnders backlot at Elstree would also be expanded, with greater use made of locations immediately around Albert Square, such as the tube station. \"People will see a bit more and there will be some new buildings,\" he added. \"We'll show people a bit more of the Walford that exists around Albert Square.\" Daytime soap Doctors has been used as a training ground for writers and directors who would now be moving onto an expanded EastEnders production team, Mr Young said.",

The paper says that Gerald Houllier has been \"dazzled\" with Kanoute's form this season, and if he can offload Fowler for \u00a314m he will then move for Kanoute. Meanwhile, Liverpool have denied any interest in Coventry goalkeeper Chris Kirkland. \"Every time I say I like a player it gets reported that I am going to make a bid for him,\" Houllier told Teamtalk. \"A figure of \u00a37m came up in Kirkland's case and I think it is ridiculous. It is stupid and I think it is being done to destabilise us.\" Hertha Berlin centre-back Marko Rehmer could be at Highbury next week to talk about a summer transfer to Arsenal, reports the Daily Mail. Rehmer's agent Joerg Neubauer said: \"Marko knows about the training facilities at Arsenal after the Germany squad were allowed to use them before the World Cup qualifier with England in October. But maybe he wants to go over and see Arsene Wenger. He could do that after Hertha return from a training camp in Marbella next Sunday.\" Arsenal are also watching Blackburn's David Dunn and Dean Aston of Crewe, according to the Star. West Ham are hoping to revive the \u00a33m transfer of Lorenzo Amoruso when he returns from Rangers' mid-season break in Florida, reports the Mail. Hammers managing director Paul Aldridge admitted: \"We still hope a sensible solution can be arrived at but we will have to wait and see.\" West Ham are also hoping to sign Norwegian U-21 defender Ragnvald Soma for \u00a32.3m later today. Bryne chairman Svein Bragstad told Planet Football: \"I can confirm that we are in talks with West Ham about Soma. They have made a bid and we expect to have an agreement during today.\" And West Ham could be also ready to make a bid for Vicenza striker Luca Toni, reports Planet Football. The website claims the Hammers had Toni watched against Lecce at the weekend. Newcastle defender Didier Domi will move to Paris Saint Germain in \"a matter of hours\", reports Teamtalk. The website claims the two clubs have agreed a \u00a33.5m for the player. Southampton midfielder Hassan Kachloul is poised to complete a \u00a31.5m move to Ipswich, reports the Daily Express. Sunderland manager Peter Reid has expressed an interest in Swansea's 20-year-old winger Stuart Roberts, reports the Star - but he faces competition from Manchester City and Southampton.",

There are now eight such TSF workers in El Salvador. \"They scan the news wires and leap on a plane often without a visa,\" said the spokesman, who described the TSF team as \"action-man types\". </p> <p>The earthquake also demonstrated the wide range of international cooperation, with the Mexicans sending troops, the Colombians sending coffins, the Spanish sending sniffer dogs, the Americans sending medical supplies and a variety of international aid organisations, including many British ones, pooling resources. </p> <p>\u2022 The government yesterday announced it has committed more than \u00a3600,000 in aid to El Salvador as British charities launched appeals. </p> <p>The international development minister, George Foulkes, said the government would \"respond sympathetically\" to further requests for assistance. </p> <p>The EU said it was sending \u00a31.27m in emergency aid. </p> <p>The British Red Cross El Salvador Earthquake Appeal Line is 08705 125 125, or donations can be made via the website, <a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk\">The British Red Cross</a> </p> <p>Unicef's El Salvador Earthquake Children's Appeal call 0345 312 312, or make donations online at <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk\">Unicef</a> </p> <p><strong>Buried alive: Earthquake rescues</strong><br></p> <p><strong>November 1999</strong> Duzce, Turkey.

All that is to say nothing of the previous health minister, the erstwhile agriculture minister and their former colleague in charge at transport. The first two resigned this month amid uproar over the government's botched handling of the spread of BSE to Germany. The third went at the end of last year after pleading guilty in court to charges of financial wrongdoing in the days when he was a football club chairman. Yet, arguably, the member of the cabinet who is under closest scrutiny of all is its boss, the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. This week, for the first time since late 1999, when the opposition Christian Democrats were first hit by a scandal over illegal party funding, a poll showed Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats trailing in second place.

Once again, Mr Schr\u00f6der has left an impression that he sees ideological principles as mere implements in a box of tools he uses to maintain good relations with his party. It was the same in late 1999 when he had his back to the wall after a series of regional election defeats that left-wing Social Democrats blamed on his espousal of \"Third Way\" reform. Overnight, the chancellor switched into old-fashioned interventionist mode and bailed out an ailing construction group. It secured him an easy ride at that year's party conference, but it profoundly disconcerted foreign investors and put a question mark over his commitment to the sort of policies adopted by Tony Blair in Britain. That question mark has never gone away. One moment, Mr Schr\u00f6der is handing out swingeing tax cuts; the next he is endorsing Germany's thoroughly archaic legislation on shopping hours. The ship he captains has shown itself to be remarkably seaworthy. It has come through storms and squalls alike. But it is by no means clear to the passengers which course it is on. And so it is perhaps only natural that they should be alarmed when, every so often, a member of the crew gets washed off the deck.

The seventh we don't have to guess at, and betrays the awful truth of the other wrappings. This was a man. Part of his face is visible at one end, and at the other, his lower legs and feet protrude from beneath a yellow blanket. </p> <p>This photograph of corpses lying on an unrefrigerated floor in Bedford Hospital, which appeared in newspapers yesterday, has caused horror and dismay. It has provoked a new outcry over the state of the National Health Service, in which one hospital had nowhere to store the dead. The hospital mortuary was full and a temporary one was out of action because of problems with the doors. </p> <p>Yet it could be argued that there is no more respectful place to store bodies in a crisis than in the hospital chapel. Public hygiene would not have allowed them to stay there for long. And in an age when we are used to hearing about patients waiting in corridors on trolleys, why are we so shocked by the idea of corpses lying for a time on the floor? Could the truth be that the horror the picture instils in us has less to do with our worries over NHS resources than some deeply held feelings about what is due to the dead, and some even deeper anxieties about facing the only thing inevitable for all of us? </p> <p>Jenny Hockey, a senior lecturer in social policy at Hull University, and one of the authors of Beyond the Body: Death and Social Identity, thinks our usual contact with death, in an age where 70% die in hospital, is limited and cosmeticised. If you go to the funeral director's viewing parlour, you see something that resembles the person you loved - dressed in their clothes, perhaps made up. \"But what that looks like,\" she says of the picture at Bedford, \"is a heap of rubbish. Our bodies are us. Perhaps increasingly we use our bodies to make statements about who we are, what with the emphasis on dress and fashion and cosmetic surgery and breast implants. But at the end of the day we are just an object, and something to be disposed of.\" </p> <p>The bundled bodies were once seven individuals who probably never met in life. They haven't the option to avoid each other in death. \"They are jumbled together. It gives you images of the pauper's grave - holocaust imagery and all the mass graves.\" </p> <p>Individual achievement in life has long given us the right to individuality when it ends, with a grave bearing our name. Only paupers did not use to get one. The Anatomy Act of the 1830s made it legal for their bodies to be used for dissection. \"To have your body given into the hands of people who didn't know you was the final insult,\" says Hockey. </p> <p>Somehow, the exposed feet, which have flopped apart lifelessly, are the most shocking part of the Bedford photograph. Having your toes turned up is a metaphor for death, Hockey points out. Dead bodies have been pictured with a luggage label tied to the big toe. It is a powerful image. Hands and feet - once so strong and active - are stilled. </p> <p>Of course, the fact that the bodies were in a hospital makes it worse. \"This is an institution which we hope we can trust, but have lots of worries about. This is like confronting our worst fears. You put yourself in their hands and this is how you end up,\" says Hockey. A growing trend towards woodland burials, secularised ceremonies in which friends and family celebrate the passing, and young victims of Aids planning their own last rites, assert the importance of individuality to the end and beyond. But bundled bodies on a floor is \"like being stripped of who we are by an institution\". </p> <p>Social anthropologist Leonie Kellaher, from the University of North London, thinks the picture is disturbing because of a strange mixture of associations. \"It is the kind of scene we associate with famine. They are bound up like something from Ethiopia. It is not a mortuary scene with which people will be familiar, and yet it is in a hospital.\" In this country, burials take place in coffins, except in the Muslim community where bodies can be wrapped and faces exposed. </p> <p>She and co-author Doris Francis are working on a book, provisionally entitled The Secret Cemetery. Much of what happens to dead bodies is still secret, Kellaher says, even if they are no longer rifled for their pituitary glands and spare parts as they once were. Processes like the laying out are a mystery to most of us. It wasn't always like that. In the East End in the 1930s, people died at home and a local woman, whose job it was, would prepare the body for viewing in the front room. \"She would do it at home because people couldn't afford the funeral expenses. Children would visit dead babies.\" </p> <p>Most of us now die a medicalised death. Families are unsure whether they can cope with a death at home. So we have no control over the body of our parent when he or she dies. We expect the hospital to behave in as reverent a fashion as we would. But it doesn't always happen that way. </p> <p>Malcolm Johnson, chair of the National Funeral College, says that the moral panic over the bodies in the chapel is maybe \"an example of being shocked by what we don't know . . . How many people have been to a mortuary? People have no sense of what is custom and practice. There are a lot of things hospitals do at the end of life that are reprehensible.\" </p> <p>As soon as a patient dies, he says, \"they whisk the body off at great speed. Very often they lie about on trolleys here and there just covered up - sometimes in corridors or waiting outside the mortuary,\" says Johnson. Their personal effects are put in a black bin-liner to be handed to the relative. </p> <p>But in an increasingly secular society, where vast numbers of people would say, if asked, that a human being is nothing more than some recyclable material after death, what is this worry about the treatment of our mortal remains? According to Tony Walters, director of the MA course in death and society at Reading University, it has existed in human culture for a very long time, and it runs very deep. </p> <p>\"We are reasonably comfortable with skeletons because they are in their final state, but something in between that and the live body moving around is a very problematic object, especially a freshly dead corpse which somehow looks alive and yet isn't. </p> <p>\"It is why human societies deal with their recently dead in a highly ritualised fashion. All societies create quite well understood ritual rules about how the dead but not buried should be handled. Even a reasonably free society like ours, not governed much by etiquette, has rules. When they are broken, we feel disgust, which is what has happened with these pictures.\" </p> <p> It is quite difficult for hospitals to get it right, he says. They are bureaucratic, pragmatic, technology-oriented places. A dead body is a collection of non-functioning human tissue, due for disposal. The mysteries of rite and ritual, which mean so much to friends and family, may go by the board. \"People working within the bureaucratic medical framework can quite easily forget what is ritually required,\" says Walters. </p> <p>It doesn't mean that they can cope any better with the newly dead. Morticians and others who handle bodies as a routine have their own shield, which is often black humour. We all need a filter. </p> <p>\"Neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily,\" said the 17th-century writer la Rochefoucauld. Archaeologists have revealed the death rituals and rites of civilisations through past ages, to the Pyramids and beyond. The deepest act of degradation to someone who has died is to treat their remains without respect. It happened to the Jews in the last war. It happened in past centuries to traitors in England who were hanged, drawn and then quartered. </p> <p>Death is shocking because we do not understand it, and cannot control it. Religion helps us to cope, as do secular rituals and social rules. When the rules are flouted, and bodies are not tended and cared for in the way we expect, whether in a war like Kosovo or on a hospital floor, we all feel the offence - because it brings home the grim nakedness of death. </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,422888,00.html\">Bodies chief scandal quits</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,422802,00.html\">What happens when we die?</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Ministers were furious last night that their efforts to rebuild public confidence in the NHS had been dented by disturbing photographs of bodies lying on the floor of a chapel at Bedford hospital. </p> <p>Ken Williams, the hospital's chief executive, resigned after an internal NHS inquiry found that up to eight bodies at a time were stored on the floor of the chapel of rest, without refrigeration and wrapped only in sheets. </p> <p>Alan Milburn, the health secretary, was said to have been \"distressed and appalled\" when he was told that the mistake was made after the hospital's temporary mortuary was decommissioned because the doors needed oiling. </p> <p>Mr Williams said: \"We failed on this particular occasion.\" </p> <p>Peter Houghton, the NHS executive regional director of the eastern region, said: \"The appalling pictures that appeared in newspapers in the past two days have brought to light a totally unacceptable practice at Bedford NHS Trust. </p> <p>\"This has caused considerable distress not only to friends and relatives of the deceased and the general public but to staff within the hospital. Guidance insists that patients are treated with respect and dignity. That was certainly not the case last week.\" </p> <p>The episode was particularly infuriating for ministers who had been bracing themselves for stories of difficulties for patients caused by winter pressures on the health service. This was the last hurdle that Tony Blair needed to surmount before calling an early general election in May. </p> <p>So far the NHS has escaped normal winter pressures and flu levels have been lower than usual for this time of year. The bad publicity was unnecessary and avoidable. </p> <p>Mr Houghton refused to lay the blame on Mr Williams personally, instead citing more general management problems. \"This was a failure of management guidance,\" he said. \"Ken Williams has discussed the findings of the investigation with the chairman of the trust, Professor Andrew Blowers and myself, and felt it right to stand down. I respect his decision.\" </p> <p>But Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, said the resignation did not remove the need for an independent inquiry. \"We have evidence these practices have been going on for at least three years. There are major problems in this hospital that require detailed investigation,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Any such investigation must be completely independent, with outside bodies scrutinising all aspects of the directions to management and any political interference in clinical priorities and the treatment of patients.\" </p> <p>Mr Houghton said the practice of using the chapel of rest as a makeshift mortuary ended last Friday, but he admitted that the practice had occurred before, despite Department of Health guidance issued in May last year insisting that patients are treated with respect and dignity. </p> <p>He said: \"This was clearly not taken on board by the trust's management. Despite having a temporary mortuary available, bodies were stored on the floor in totally inappropriate conditions.\" </p> <p>An initial NHS inquiry took place yesterday at the hospital to establish why the temporary mortuary, bought last year to cope with anticipated winter deaths, was closed. </p> <p>A hospital spokeswoman said the main mortuary was full and the temporary one was closed for \"health and safety reasons\" when a porter injured his hands trying to open the door. </p> <p>The hospital insisted that no bodies would have been kept in the chapel for more than 24 hours. </p> <p>Department of health sources said the action yesterday demonstrated that the NHS was determined to act swiftly to tackle mistakes. </p> <p>The family of 77-year-old Basil Riches, from Bedford, said they had been horrified by recognising him in newspaper photographs and were planning to take legal advice. </p> <p>\"The whole family is devastated,\" said Mr Riches' son-in-law, Garry Weaver, who had travelled to England from the US with his wife Julie for Mr Riches' funeral. </p> <p>\"No one from the hospital got in touch to say there was a problem with the mortuary. We haven't had an apology of any kind from the hospital. He has lost all of his dignity. He was a good man who paid his taxes. He didn't deserve this,\" he said. </p> <p>Ms Weaver said: \"The hospital is going to have to answer an awful lot of questions for leaving people like that just on the floor, discarded like a piece of trash.\"</p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,422801,00.html\">16.01.2001: Lost rites</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,422802,00.html\">16.01.2001: What happens when we die?</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Ministers were furious last night that their efforts to rebuild public confidence in the NHS had been dented by disturbing photographs of bodies lying on the floor of a chapel at Bedford hospital. Ken Williams, the hospital's chief executive, resigned after an internal NHS inquiry found that up to eight bodies at a time were stored on the floor of the chapel of rest, without refrigeration and wrapped only in sheets. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, was said to have been \"distressed and appalled\" when he was told that the mistake was made after the hospital's temporary mortuary was decommissioned because the doors needed oiling. Mr Williams said: \"We failed on this particular occasion.\" Peter Houghton, the NHS executive regional director of the eastern region, said: \"The appalling pictures that appeared in newspapers in the past two days have brought to light a totally unacceptable practice at Bedford NHS Trust. \"This has caused considerable distress not only to friends and relatives of the deceased and the general public but to staff within the hospital. Guidance insists that patients are treated with respect and dignity. That was certainly not the case last week.\" The episode was particularly infuriating for ministers who had been bracing themselves for stories of difficulties for patients caused by winter pressures on the health service. This was the last hurdle that Tony Blair needed to surmount before calling an early general election in May. So far the NHS has escaped normal winter pressures and flu levels have been lower than usual for this time of year. The bad publicity was unnecessary and avoidable. Mr Houghton refused to lay the blame on Mr Williams personally, instead citing more general management problems. \"This was a failure of management guidance,\" he said. \"Ken Williams has discussed the findings of the investigation with the chairman of the trust, Professor Andrew Blowers and myself, and felt it right to stand down. I respect his decision.\" But Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, said the resignation did not remove the need for an independent inquiry. \"We have evidence these practices have been going on for at least three years. There are major problems in this hospital that require detailed investigation,\" he said. \"Any such investigation must be completely independent, with outside bodies scrutinising all aspects of the directions to management and any political interference in clinical priorities and the treatment of patients.\" Mr Houghton said the practice of using the chapel of rest as a makeshift mortuary ended last Friday, but he admitted that the practice had occurred before, despite Department of Health guidance issued in May last year insisting that patients are treated with respect and dignity. He said: \"This was clearly not taken on board by the trust's management. Despite having a temporary mortuary available, bodies were stored on the floor in totally inappropriate conditions.\" An initial NHS inquiry took place yesterday at the hospital to establish why the temporary mortuary, bought last year to cope with anticipated winter deaths, was closed. A hospital spokeswoman said the main mortuary was full and the temporary one was closed for \"health and safety reasons\" when a porter injured his hands trying to open the door. The hospital insisted that no bodies would have been kept in the chapel for more than 24 hours. Department of health sources said the action yesterday demonstrated that the NHS was determined to act swiftly to tackle mistakes. The family of 77-year-old Basil Riches, from Bedford, said they had been horrified by recognising him in newspaper photographs and were planning to take legal advice. \"The whole family is devastated,\" said Mr Riches' son-in-law, Garry Weaver, who had travelled to England from the US with his wife Julie for Mr Riches' funeral. \"No one from the hospital got in touch to say there was a problem with the mortuary. We haven't had an apology of any kind from the hospital. He has lost all of his dignity. He was a good man who paid his taxes. He didn't deserve this,\" he said. Ms Weaver said: \"The hospital is going to have to answer an awful lot of questions for leaving people like that just on the floor, discarded like a piece of trash.\" Related articles 16.01.2001: Lost rites 16.01.2001: What happens when we die?",

How different does it look now? The Financial Times ended the last year quoting an analyst at Merrill Lynch - \"People now feel nauseous when you mention the word 'internet', whereas in March it was the new paradigm.\" </p> <p>Which is all rather embarrassing if you look at the current UCAS guide and the courses that are hurriedly being prepared for the 2002 issue. There, internet studies and e-commerce is the big growth area. </p> <p>With higher education institutions pushed to compete in the market place, the internet and e-commerce seemed to be the place to be. Course planning structures were streamlined, new courses rushed out and old ones modified. But now the internet bubble has burst it is not only academic investors in lastminute.com who are left with egg on their faces. </p> <p>In the 2000 UCAS guide, 13 institutions offered degrees in some aspect of the internet and a further three in internet engineering. For 2001 more than 30 institutions are listed under \"internet\" alone, offering some 130 degree courses. Some institutions appear to have got swept up more than others. Lincolnshire and Humberside list nearly 30 courses involving the internet, Anglia 19 and Bolton Institute of Higher Education 11. But look beyond the internet section and there is more. In straight business studies, a dozen institutions are offering new e-commerce degrees with Brunel having created three degree routes. And this is to say nothing of the business information technology degrees and the modifications introduced to make other, seemingly \"old-fashioned\" degrees that much more more alluring. </p> <p>How did so many in higher education get caught up in the internet and e-commerce bubble? Just as in the real market it is hard to separate real opportunities from the hype; the same problems exist in the pseudo-market of higher education. The search for quick-fix growth areas to establish institutional profiles, the idea of academic entrepreneurship, the aim of attracting funding from cash-rich (but unprofitable) internet firms, as well as the fear of being left out, have all helped to turn heads and drive institutions forward into this new area with scant regard for its real potential. </p> <p>And what exactly will courses in e-commerce, internet business and marketing teach? In the heady days of the bubble, the talk was of \"new paradigm\" theory. At the level of the global economy the internet was creating a new industrial revolution that would perpetuate high growth, high productivity and low inflation. E-commerce was said to have rewritten the rule book. Profits no longer mattered, nor did sales. What was important was customer base measured in website hits, which provided the evidence for future potential and inflated share prices. </p> <p>Now all of this is gone. In the B2C area (business to consumer) big company after big company has crashed. Never mind, said the pundits, the real potential is to B2B (business to business) - until reality forced a more sober view there. Still others insisted that the real potential was hardware and software development, then the puncturing of the boom hit this sector, too. (In California, B2C now means \"back to college\" as disillusioned twenty-somethings who skipped university to make dot.com millions rethink their options). </p> <p>The irony is that much of the e-economy has been a gigantic value destroyer. With capital more or less free, venture after venture has been started, buoyed up only by hot air and misguided expectations and universities have meekly followed. Now it has exploded. There is no new paradigm and e-commerce has not rewritten the rules of business success. </p> <p>But this presents a problem. Traditional business studies courses developed the idea of teaching by example. Does this still apply to e-commerce courses? Business studies has also taught by means of case studies with students solving real problems. But what inspiration will they get from a diet of case studies of failures such as Boxman, Clickmango, boo.com or \"successes\" such as lastminute.com or Amazon, which have yet to show any profit at all? </p> <p>The hope of those putting forward this rash of new courses is that the e-economy will come right in the end and when the first students graduate a more stable growth path will have emerged. Just as railways survived the first railway manias, so will the internet and e-commerce. But cynics can equally point to the tulip-buying investment mania of the 17th century. Tulips, too, survived but they hardly formed the basis of a new wave of capitalist development. And in any case, try searching the UCAS guide for degrees in railway or tulip studies. </p> <p>But the lack of honesty in the evaluation of the internet and e-commerce goes further. Sex is the one area that is booming on the internet. This is not surprising because sex is the most widely used search term. But the central role of selling sex on the internet and e-commerce activity is systematically obscured by the way that sex sites are excluded from published lists of top sites. </p> <p>Last year, Forester Research suggested that successful US sex sites expected 50 million hits a month and generated incomes of $5m-$10m. Annually they estimated that US internet sex sites produce $1bn of revenue and are growing faster than any other part of the e-economy. By the middle of the decade their revenues will be over $5bn. This is not only big business but highly profitable e-business. Indeed, at one stage some estimates suggested that the major ity of e-commerce activity was in the \"adult\" industry and if the share has fallen it is possibly still the biggest single e-commerce market. </p> <p>How much of this will figure in any of these new university and college courses? Like top-shelf publishing and video development, internet sex sites invite universal condemnation yet underpin a vibrant sector that is more closely related to the mainstream than most people understand. </p> <p>Mari Kim Coleman, Britain's managing director of internet research group MMXI, says: \"Porn sites are among the top 20 sites in some countries. Adult entertainment is the 11th most popular category on the internet in Britain.\" </p> <p>When an international conference on streaming video over the internet was held last October, entrepreneurs from the \"adult industry\" boasted that sex sites provided the successful business model for the internet: an expectation of moving into the black within six months of start-up with profit margins of 20% - an achievement that puts Amazon's long search to break even into context. </p> <p>To achieve this, the sex site developers told how they had produced the easiest sites to navigate in order to attract the biggest market.

And they need the legal protection of teams of lawyers who know about internet law etc. All of which means that, like it or not, the legitimate and less legitimate \"adult industry\" is absorbing a lot of internet talent and it is likely to absorb a significant group of those who come out of the 2001 UCAS cohort. </p> <p>Yet when a group of enterprising Edinburgh graduates were found last year to have set up highly profitable Antigua-based sex sites they were roundly condemned.

      "body": "<p>Documents revealing that senior rail managers, including Railtrack officials, were fully aware of a cracked rail at the site of the Hatfield crash at least 10 months before the fatal accident last October, but failed to remedy it, have been obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>Internal documents from Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance Ltd, the contractor appointed by Railtrack to maintain the Hatfield section, show for the first time that two separate recommendations to replace a suspect section of the track where the derailment later occurred, were ignored.</p> <p>The two key recommendations from the site manager to the area maintenance engineer came in November 1999 and January last year.</p> <p>A fax on November 17 1999 proposed that the section of track from London should be rerailed within six months. The work should therefore have been completed by May 17 at the latest. The Hatfield crash occurred exactly five months later, on October 17.</p> <p>The second document obtained is a Balfour Beatty track inspection sheet dated January 11 last year. The same area is recorded by the site manager as having \"gauge corner cracking\" which was \"showing bad\". The request was repeated to rerail the track within six months.</p> <p>Railtrack was formally told of the problem on December 6, 1999. It has only publicly conceded that it was aware of the situation in January last year and that the section was reassessed for rerailing last July.</p> <p>Some work was completed in May. The fatal section of the Hatfield line was treated by grinding on September 4 and 5 as part of the \"planned preventative maintenance to stop rail breaks and improve ride quality\", Railtrack said. The rest was due to be finished last November.</p> <p>Industry sources told the Guardian last night that Balfour Beatty staff in the Hitchin area, where the Hatfield site is situated, had been concerned about the state of the rails, but no remedial action was taken.</p> <p>The documents do not explain why speed restrictions were not imposed when it became known that the track was deteriorating.</p> <p>The company wrote to Railtrack on December 6 1999 to inform it of the problem. There followed a joint visit to the site by Railtrack and Balfour Beatty on February 15 last year \"to look at pricing and re-railing\".</p> <p>Balfour Beatty said that by the end of last March, Railtrack had \"got it in their programme\", but asked Jarvis, another contractor, to do the work because it carries out renewal work for Railtrack on the east coast main line between London and the Scottish border.</p> <p>The work was scheduled for May, the materials were delivered but only half the job was carried out.</p> <p>Balfour Beatty said: \"The expectation was that the work should have been completed, but it was not.

      "bodyText": "Documents revealing that senior rail managers, including Railtrack officials, were fully aware of a cracked rail at the site of the Hatfield crash at least 10 months before the fatal accident last October, but failed to remedy it, have been obtained by the Guardian. Internal documents from Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance Ltd, the contractor appointed by Railtrack to maintain the Hatfield section, show for the first time that two separate recommendations to replace a suspect section of the track where the derailment later occurred, were ignored. The two key recommendations from the site manager to the area maintenance engineer came in November 1999 and January last year. A fax on November 17 1999 proposed that the section of track from London should be rerailed within six months. The work should therefore have been completed by May 17 at the latest. The Hatfield crash occurred exactly five months later, on October 17. The second document obtained is a Balfour Beatty track inspection sheet dated January 11 last year. The same area is recorded by the site manager as having \"gauge corner cracking\" which was \"showing bad\". The request was repeated to rerail the track within six months. Railtrack was formally told of the problem on December 6, 1999. It has only publicly conceded that it was aware of the situation in January last year and that the section was reassessed for rerailing last July. Some work was completed in May. The fatal section of the Hatfield line was treated by grinding on September 4 and 5 as part of the \"planned preventative maintenance to stop rail breaks and improve ride quality\", Railtrack said. The rest was due to be finished last November. Industry sources told the Guardian last night that Balfour Beatty staff in the Hitchin area, where the Hatfield site is situated, had been concerned about the state of the rails, but no remedial action was taken. The documents do not explain why speed restrictions were not imposed when it became known that the track was deteriorating. The company wrote to Railtrack on December 6 1999 to inform it of the problem. There followed a joint visit to the site by Railtrack and Balfour Beatty on February 15 last year \"to look at pricing and re-railing\". Balfour Beatty said that by the end of last March, Railtrack had \"got it in their programme\", but asked Jarvis, another contractor, to do the work because it carries out renewal work for Railtrack on the east coast main line between London and the Scottish border. The work was scheduled for May, the materials were delivered but only half the job was carried out. Balfour Beatty said: \"The expectation was that the work should have been completed, but it was not. We accept that we have the authority to impose speed restrictions, but this was not done.\" Railtrack said the site was due for rerailing in the spring of last year \"but, for whatever reasons, it did not happen.\" Asked why no speed restrictions were enforced, a spokesman replied: \"That is one of the matters which the current investigation is examining\". It said its maintenance contractors employed a \"rapid response provision\", allowing them to impose speed restrictions or \"order the immediate replacement of rail\". Railtrack said it could not comment directly about the November and January recommendations to replace the suspect track, but claimed that \"the cost of rerailing the track is never an issue where safety is concerned\". After the Hatfield crash, Railtrack identified another 300 sites throughout the country where gauge corner cracking was severe. This led to the introduction of hundreds of extra speed restrictions. Railtrack's woes mounted last night as it threatened to pull out of the \u00a32.5bn second stage of the Channel Tunnel rail link in a worsening financial crisis which will leave it with \u00a38bn of debt by 2003. Its chief exeutive said the company would have debts of \u00a33bn by the end of the year, rising by a couple of billion a year thereafter. The Hatfield crash has so far cost it \u00a3600m.",

      "body": "<p>Either there are a lot of Mancunians in London who are following Manchester's thriving young jazz underground, or the charisma of singer/pianist John Ellis's Big Bang has reached those parts of the population most localised jazz phenomena don't reach. The Jazz Cafe was jammed on Sunday for the London leg of the Big Bang's current tour, its first venture outside of the north-west - although, as Ellis has admitted, a good many of his musicians have already gravitated south for work and made a lot of friends doing so. </p> <p>Ellis is a dynamic 32-year-old who might be conveniently described as a cross between Django Bates and Jools Holland, and who is by repute a mover and shaker in the creative music of his home city. Big Bang, the vigorous 12-piece that evolved out of his Frank Zappa tribute band in 1995, is an irrepressible outfit that sustains the effect of somebody conducting an animated conversation at a loud party for a couple of hours. It also packs some excellent soloists. </p> <p>The band can snap in and out of pumping 1940s big-band swing, raucous jazz-funk, soul vocals and Hammond organ barrages without pausing for thought. In guitarist Mike Outram, trombonist Chris Bridges, and the rugged keyboard interjections and punchy ensemble playing of Ellis himself, there are individual voices as strong as the main events. </p> <p>Big Bang was preceded by another young Manchester outfit, the Stuart McCallum Quartet; they looked like Big Issue vendors, and played a scalding brand of guitar-led jazz-funk driven by exhilaratingly thrashy percussion. </p> <p>Big Bang themselves began with a sermonising Charles Mingus-like overture, switched into headlong funk for a wild solo from Outram, behind which the others began to clap, and travelled via wandering contrapuntal horn lines back to the main theme. </p> <p>Ellis established that his jazz roots were as strong as his party instincts with a late-Duke Ellington blues that made the saxes elegantly reproduce the authentic swell and withdrawal of the maestro's reed sound. A subtle orchestral original that followed had its intertwining lines delivered with Big Bang's characteristic firmness and vigour, before turning into a Latin groover. </p> <p>Big Bang makes vocals a central strength of its show, with three singers, including the leader, unfurling a sharply arranged repertoire mingling the eager clamour of contemporary pop with a cheesy jauntiness from Cuban dance music. Ellis's opinion is that you can raise hell in a provincial city without anybody in the wider world hearing the faintest tinkle of it, but maybe in Big Bang's case that's about to change.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Either there are a lot of Mancunians in London who are following Manchester's thriving young jazz underground, or the charisma of singer/pianist John Ellis's Big Bang has reached those parts of the population most localised jazz phenomena don't reach. The Jazz Cafe was jammed on Sunday for the London leg of the Big Bang's current tour, its first venture outside of the north-west - although, as Ellis has admitted, a good many of his musicians have already gravitated south for work and made a lot of friends doing so. Ellis is a dynamic 32-year-old who might be conveniently described as a cross between Django Bates and Jools Holland, and who is by repute a mover and shaker in the creative music of his home city. Big Bang, the vigorous 12-piece that evolved out of his Frank Zappa tribute band in 1995, is an irrepressible outfit that sustains the effect of somebody conducting an animated conversation at a loud party for a couple of hours. It also packs some excellent soloists. The band can snap in and out of pumping 1940s big-band swing, raucous jazz-funk, soul vocals and Hammond organ barrages without pausing for thought. In guitarist Mike Outram, trombonist Chris Bridges, and the rugged keyboard interjections and punchy ensemble playing of Ellis himself, there are individual voices as strong as the main events. Big Bang was preceded by another young Manchester outfit, the Stuart McCallum Quartet; they looked like Big Issue vendors, and played a scalding brand of guitar-led jazz-funk driven by exhilaratingly thrashy percussion. Big Bang themselves began with a sermonising Charles Mingus-like overture, switched into headlong funk for a wild solo from Outram, behind which the others began to clap, and travelled via wandering contrapuntal horn lines back to the main theme. Ellis established that his jazz roots were as strong as his party instincts with a late-Duke Ellington blues that made the saxes elegantly reproduce the authentic swell and withdrawal of the maestro's reed sound. A subtle orchestral original that followed had its intertwining lines delivered with Big Bang's characteristic firmness and vigour, before turning into a Latin groover. Big Bang makes vocals a central strength of its show, with three singers, including the leader, unfurling a sharply arranged repertoire mingling the eager clamour of contemporary pop with a cheesy jauntiness from Cuban dance music. Ellis's opinion is that you can raise hell in a provincial city without anybody in the wider world hearing the faintest tinkle of it, but maybe in Big Bang's case that's about to change.",

      "body": "<p>Given the disloyalty to the crown that has been rampant elsewhere in these pages over the past few weeks, it should be stressed at once that this column hereby wishes Princess Margaret a full and speedy recovery. One was also distressed to learn that the Queen Mother stumbled at Sandringham on Sunday. So greetings to you too, ma'am.</p> <p>In return, there is a small request. Could you both give a ring when convenient please, because something extraordinary has just struck me. After a lifetime spent as a loyal-ish subject of your sister/daughter and watching the family on telly doing whatever, one knows exactly what you look like but has no idea what you sound like. And a quick survey in the pub suggests one is not alone.</p> <p>This is the reverse of the situation in the middle class's other favourite long-running soap. In The Archers, the voice of, say, Eddie Grundy is instantly recognisable but not his face. In The Royals it's the other way about. Does Princess Margaret, as one would like to imagine, have a lived-in, husky voice, combining Fenella Fielding, Edith Piaf and a soupcon of Hyacinth Bucket? Maybe you've met her, or remember her on Desert Island Discs (1981) or saying \"Goodnight\" on Children's Hour (1940). Otherwise, who could know?</p> <p>I did hear the Queen Mother at the pageant for her 100th birthday. She spoke for about 10 seconds, which slightly dented the theory that she has a Gracie Fields-style Lankysheer accent. But for normal conversation the Queen keeps an entirely different voice from the familiar husband-and-I drone. So the file on her mother is still open. Even the BBC archive apparently has very little.</p> <p>The Queen Mother is, of course, the link with a distant royal past. She was already alive on January 22 1901, a century ago next Monday, when Queen Victoria died. Instinctively, you think that royalty must since then have become infinitely more accessible and closer to the public. Maybe not.</p> <p>Though Victoria's voice remains a mystery for obvious reasons, her innermost thoughts are available. In 1868 she published Leaves from the Journal from Our Life in the Highlands, followed 16 years later by More Leaves. We think of her as an infinitely remote and forbidding figure, but in the context of the time publishing her diary was the equivalent of submitting to interview by Anthony Clare.</p> <p>There are no major indiscretions of state (\"Gladstone came round.

      "bodyText": "Given the disloyalty to the crown that has been rampant elsewhere in these pages over the past few weeks, it should be stressed at once that this column hereby wishes Princess Margaret a full and speedy recovery. One was also distressed to learn that the Queen Mother stumbled at Sandringham on Sunday. So greetings to you too, ma'am. In return, there is a small request. Could you both give a ring when convenient please, because something extraordinary has just struck me. After a lifetime spent as a loyal-ish subject of your sister/daughter and watching the family on telly doing whatever, one knows exactly what you look like but has no idea what you sound like. And a quick survey in the pub suggests one is not alone. This is the reverse of the situation in the middle class's other favourite long-running soap. In The Archers, the voice of, say, Eddie Grundy is instantly recognisable but not his face. In The Royals it's the other way about. Does Princess Margaret, as one would like to imagine, have a lived-in, husky voice, combining Fenella Fielding, Edith Piaf and a soupcon of Hyacinth Bucket? Maybe you've met her, or remember her on Desert Island Discs (1981) or saying \"Goodnight\" on Children's Hour (1940). Otherwise, who could know? I did hear the Queen Mother at the pageant for her 100th birthday. She spoke for about 10 seconds, which slightly dented the theory that she has a Gracie Fields-style Lankysheer accent. But for normal conversation the Queen keeps an entirely different voice from the familiar husband-and-I drone. So the file on her mother is still open. Even the BBC archive apparently has very little. The Queen Mother is, of course, the link with a distant royal past. She was already alive on January 22 1901, a century ago next Monday, when Queen Victoria died. Instinctively, you think that royalty must since then have become infinitely more accessible and closer to the public. Maybe not. Though Victoria's voice remains a mystery for obvious reasons, her innermost thoughts are available. In 1868 she published Leaves from the Journal from Our Life in the Highlands, followed 16 years later by More Leaves. We think of her as an infinitely remote and forbidding figure, but in the context of the time publishing her diary was the equivalent of submitting to interview by Anthony Clare. There are no major indiscretions of state (\"Gladstone came round. What a slimy fat puffball!\"). And Victoria was no Alan Clark in the matter of style either. Most of her material is descriptive, but unfortunately her powers of description are rather lim ited. The road to Blair Atholl is \"beautiful\"; the morning they sailed to Arran was \"beautiful\"; so were the Kingussie road, the Falls of Garbhalt, Alt-Na-Giuthasach, and even the Rev McLeod's sermon. Occasionally, things are \"provoking\". Indeed, by 1866 something very provoking had happened - her beloved husband, Prince Albert, was dead. And what made her journals something other than laughable was the transparency of her emotions. In the first volume it was not just the scenery that was beautiful. Life was too. Albert strides through the book in his tweeds, killing a stag every few pages, informing Victoria at every turn in the road that a particular sight was just like Germany, Switzerland or Italy, and she repeating his every banality as though it were a piercing insight. The second volume is far more sombre. Her grief, bordering on obsession, suffuses every page, even the ones dominated by her servant (and alleged lover) John Brown. In both she comes across as very human and rather endearing. There was a wonderful moment when she and Albert were incognito and stopped at the inn at Dalwhinnie: \"There was hardly anything to eat .. only tea and two miserable starved Highland chickens.

      "bodyText": "President-elect George W Bush's plans to cut government aid to the poor and let private philanthropists shoulder the burden is already reaping its reward. It was announced yesterday that 100m euros had been donated to impoverished Americans by a certain S Hussein of Baghdad. Despite a decade of biting international sanctions and a poverty rate in Iraq of more than 50%, Saddam Hussein has apparently decided to mark the tenth anniversary of the Gulf war by sending humanitarian aid to America's inner cities and rural poor. A statement put out by the Iraqi News Agency (INA) said a special commission would be set up to help supervise the distribution of the funds. Given the current state of relations between the two countries, it is unlikely that the US will allow Saddam's uniformed lieutenants to wander the streets of the Bronx or east Washington, distributing his dole, which would work out at about $3 for each American living under the poverty line. The INA statement said the UN would be told of the donation, suggesting that its aid workers might help implement the programme. The UN in New York said it had had no word from Baghdad about the donation, and its response would depend on where the money was coming from. Since the Gulf war Iraq has been allowed to use the proceeds of its oil sales only to buy food, medicine and other essentials for its own people. \"It's unclear if this is money the government of Iraq has lying around or if it comes from the oil-for-food deal,\" the UN spokesman said. \"If it is from the oil-for-food deal, then it would have to go before the security council sanctions committee, to see if [it] would be allowed.\" The committee is still bemused by Saddam Hussein's previous philanthropic outburst, in December: the promise of \u20ac1bn - he refuses to talk dollars - to help the Palestinian struggle against Israel. In the West Bank and Gaza they are not holding their breath: his earlier promises to send troops came to nothing. But his claim to have so much cash to send abroad may end up hurting his efforts to have the sanctions lifted. Some security council members are said to have questioned whether the sanctions regime is tough enough, if he has so much money to give away.",

      "body": "<p>The South African government has been accused of riding roughshod over democracy in rejecting a parliamentary demand for the leading anti-corruption investigator to join the inquiry into an arms deal involving British and other foreign firms.</p> <p>President Thabo Mbeki was recommended by the justice minister, Penuell Maduna, yesterday to defy the request that Judge Willem Heath should join the three agencies investigating alleged irregularities in the 43bn rand (\u00a34bn) deal.</p> <p>The parliamentary public accounts committee ordered the inquiry after the auditor general reported that there might have been kickbacks and nepotism in the awarding of contracts, and questioned why the original cost of 29bn rand had risen by almost a third in a year.</p> <p>The committee wants to know whether the government is paying twice as much as necessary for 52 Hawk trainer and Gripen fighter planes supplied by a consortium of the British company BAE Systems and Saab of Sweden. BAE says it has done nothing wrong.</p> <p>Although Mr Mbeki must decide who conducts the investigation, Mr Maduna's recommendation and the public vilification of Judge Heath by the African National Congress leave little doubt that the government intends to defy MPs.</p> <p>But the judge has such a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader - due as much to his public relations as to any great exposure of graft by his special investigations unit - that the government seems to have made a political blunder in ignoring him.</p> <p>The agreement - the biggest in South Africa's history - to buy planes, ships and submarines from Britain, Germany and other European countries has never been popular.

      "bodyText": "The South African government has been accused of riding roughshod over democracy in rejecting a parliamentary demand for the leading anti-corruption investigator to join the inquiry into an arms deal involving British and other foreign firms. President Thabo Mbeki was recommended by the justice minister, Penuell Maduna, yesterday to defy the request that Judge Willem Heath should join the three agencies investigating alleged irregularities in the 43bn rand (\u00a34bn) deal. The parliamentary public accounts committee ordered the inquiry after the auditor general reported that there might have been kickbacks and nepotism in the awarding of contracts, and questioned why the original cost of 29bn rand had risen by almost a third in a year. The committee wants to know whether the government is paying twice as much as necessary for 52 Hawk trainer and Gripen fighter planes supplied by a consortium of the British company BAE Systems and Saab of Sweden. BAE says it has done nothing wrong. Although Mr Mbeki must decide who conducts the investigation, Mr Maduna's recommendation and the public vilification of Judge Heath by the African National Congress leave little doubt that the government intends to defy MPs. But the judge has such a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader - due as much to his public relations as to any great exposure of graft by his special investigations unit - that the government seems to have made a political blunder in ignoring him. The agreement - the biggest in South Africa's history - to buy planes, ships and submarines from Britain, Germany and other European countries has never been popular. When the contracts were signed in 1999 they were widely condemned as a waste of limited resources which could be used for education and housing and to combat the Aids pandemic. Mr Maduna said he rejected Judge Heath's participation because of a recent constitutional court ruling that a sitting judge cannot work for a branch of the executive. In a statement which appeared to prejudge the inquiry, Mr Maduna said there was no evidence that \"any maladministration or malpractice took place, that any state assets or state funds were paid to anybody\". But there is little doubt that the government's rejection of Judge Heath has left people feeling that it has something to hide. The Pan Africanist Congress MP Patricia de Lille raised the corruption issue in parliament more than a year ago, when she said a group of \"concerned\" ANC MP's had come to her. She gave Judge Heath documents which alleged that senior ANC politicians received bribes from arms consortiums and awarded spin-off contracts to their relatives. Yesterday she said the government would be shooting itself in the foot if it defied parliament. \"At issue is the constitutional accountability of the executive to parliament.\" \"To exclude him [Judge Heath] now will signal to the international community that democracy is under attack and that corruption is rampant in South Africa.\" The Archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Ngungane, said that if Mr Mbeki overrode parliament it would \"pose a very serious threat to the country's fragile democracy\" and put South Africa on \"the downward, slippery road to becoming a banana republic\". The Inkatha Freedom party, whose leader, Manogosuthu Buthelezi, sits in Mr Mbeki's cabinet, denounced the move as \"outrageous'\" The ANC is clearly happy to find reasons to exclude Judge Heath. It has clashed with him over funding for his unit and the amount of corruption he claims to have uncovered. It has also accused the judge, who once served in the apartheid-era black homeland of Ciskei, of \"being in cahoots with opposition parties\". Judge Heath is abroad and not expected to respond before his return on Thursday. Where it has gone wrong Despite its opponents' allegations in connection with the arms deal, there have been no credible or proved accusations of corruption by the South African government. But it has been guilty of other serious political misjudgments: Aids President Thabo Mbeki tried to backpedal after he was denounced for questioning the link between HIV and Aids. His rating in South Africa, which has the largest number of HIV-infected people in the world, fell sharply Zimbabwe The softly softly approach to Robert Mugabe has proved as ineffective as the British stick waving. But Mbeki has more to lose: the prospect of economic collapse in Zimbabwe sending large numbers of people into South Africa and destabilising the region. Lesotho The military intervention in Lesotho in 1998 was a military and political blunder. The public reacted sharply when well-armed but badly prepared South African forces ran into trouble against poorly equipped opponents and Lesotho's capital was virtually razed in the fighting.",

      "bodyText": "The flamboyant soccer chairman George Reynolds lost a legal gamble yesterday after his DIY case against a chief constable was thrown out by the high court. The former safecracker, who has made a fortune from chipboard worktops since leaving jail, faces a \u00a350,000 bill for police costs after conducting his own case. He was forced to back down during the week long case at Middlesbrough, where he claimed wrongful arrest, unlawful imprisonment and malicious prosecution after a domestic incident eight years ago. Judge Michael told the chairman of third division Darlington FC: \"You know as a businessman Mr Reynolds, once you engage in litigation there tends to be a winner and tends to be a loser. Those who play with fire, are in danger of having their fingers burned.\" After the case, Mr Reynolds said that his eight years of legal homework had been worthwhile. \"The judge has been very, very fair. I am not too disappointed and I feel I am getting out in public exactly what I want to get out.\" The judge ruled that Mr Reynolds had failed to prove his case against Barry Shaw, chief constable of Cleveland police, and had admitted during the hearing that officers had been right to arrest him in August 1992. He was held overnight in a cell after a telephone call from his former sister-in-law alleging criminal damage during acrimonious divorce proceedings with his first wife. Mr Reynolds, 64, had said before the case that he had saved \u00a364,000 by dispensing with a barrister and representing himself. He made a name for frugality with football fees at one stage in his career in charge of Darlington. The deputy chief constable of Durham, Paul Garvin, said: \"Mr Reynolds made accusations of adultery, conspiracy, perverting the course of justice and of a police cover-up and a vendetta. All of these claims I, and the other officers, find offensive.\"",

Cathy Jamet was seriously injured and taken to hospital. \"This act is a bit like William Tell,\" said Sophie Edelstein, one of the organisers of the festival and artistic director of the Pinder-Jean Richard circus. \"It's very dangerous and demands a high level of accuracy.\" She said the accident reminded everyone that circus performers often risked their lives to entertain the public. \"We are all a bit shocked but this could have happened to the tightrope walker, or the trapeze artist. It comes with the territory,\" she said. Cathy Jamet is due to be released from hospital in about two weeks. \"I am sure she will want to get back in the ring very quickly,\" Ms Edelstein said.",

      "body": "<p>Khalil al-Maqdah holds the key to the Middle East conflict in his bedside locker. Wrapped in a cheap plastic shopping bag are documents from the last days of the British mandate in Palestine showing him to be the rightful owner of a house and land in what is now Israel.</p> <p>Now said by his family to be 110 years old, Mr al-Maqdah lives close to the Mediterranean in a shabby house in the warren of alleyways that make up the Ein al-Hilweh refugee camp at Sidon, south of Beirut. Ein al-Hilweh and the other camps in Lebanon hold the most militant Palestinian refugees. If Israel and the Palestinian leadership ever sign a peace agreement, these are the people who have to be persuaded to accept it.</p> <p>Mr Maqdah's documents, brown with age and held together with clear tape, carry the stamp of the British crown's land registry office and his black, inky thumbprint. This certificate of registration, number 140,008, confirms that in 1946 he bought a three-bedroomed house and adjoining land in the village of al-Ghabissiyeh, near the northern coastal town of Akko (formerly Acre), in Galilee.</p> <p>Mr Maqdah, who worked for the British drilling for water, also has a claim on his late wife's home in a nearby village, al-Menshiyyeh.</p> <p>Mr Maqdah clings to the document, which is still legally binding, as proof of his right to return to Galilee. But Israel, during negotiations on the final shape of a settlement, expressed its determination not to recognise the right of return of the refugees scattered round the Middle East, insisting that allowing an influx of so many Palestinians would be suicidal for the Jewish state.</p> <p>Mr Maqdah's document is crucial if peace is to be achieved. If he and his family - and all the other refugee families holding similar documents - can be persuaded to compromise, peace is possible. If they decide they will settle for nothing less than a return to the site of their former villages, any peace settlement is a long way off.</p> <p>Switching reluctantly from the Hizbullah channel, where he was keeping up with the latest incidents in the Palestinian uprising, Mr Maqdah recalls the traumatic events that led to his exile in 1948 during the first Arab-Israeli war.</p> <p>\"The Jews arrived after the second world war. I laughed because I was not used to seeing men and women walking down the road together. The Jews told me they would take our land.\"</p> <p>He said he fled \"because the Jews began occupying our lands, killing our kids. We did not have weapons at the time. The English did not even allow us to carry a small knife.\" Mr Maqdah crossed the border into Lebanon at the height of the fighting. \"I thought I would be away for a week or two and then go back.\"</p> <p>Fifty-three years later, he and 3.7m others live in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. Does he think he will see his village again? \"I hope so. I hope my death is in Palestine, not here.\"</p> <p>Mr Maqdah left Israel as a widower with eight sons. Today, five generations of his family live in the camp and the family has grown to 180.</p> <p>The love of homeland and hatred of Israel have not lessened with successive generations - the younger members are violently passionate about realising Mr Maqdah's dream. His grandson, Munir al-Maqdah, 41, was born in the camp. \"I love my grandfather. We smell Palestine through my grandfather,\" he said.</p> <p>Munir has only ever seen a video of al-Ghabissiyeh, which has been in ruins since 1948. In theory, the family could move back and rebuild.

      "bodyText": "Khalil al-Maqdah holds the key to the Middle East conflict in his bedside locker. Wrapped in a cheap plastic shopping bag are documents from the last days of the British mandate in Palestine showing him to be the rightful owner of a house and land in what is now Israel. Now said by his family to be 110 years old, Mr al-Maqdah lives close to the Mediterranean in a shabby house in the warren of alleyways that make up the Ein al-Hilweh refugee camp at Sidon, south of Beirut. Ein al-Hilweh and the other camps in Lebanon hold the most militant Palestinian refugees. If Israel and the Palestinian leadership ever sign a peace agreement, these are the people who have to be persuaded to accept it. Mr Maqdah's documents, brown with age and held together with clear tape, carry the stamp of the British crown's land registry office and his black, inky thumbprint. This certificate of registration, number 140,008, confirms that in 1946 he bought a three-bedroomed house and adjoining land in the village of al-Ghabissiyeh, near the northern coastal town of Akko (formerly Acre), in Galilee. Mr Maqdah, who worked for the British drilling for water, also has a claim on his late wife's home in a nearby village, al-Menshiyyeh. Mr Maqdah clings to the document, which is still legally binding, as proof of his right to return to Galilee. But Israel, during negotiations on the final shape of a settlement, expressed its determination not to recognise the right of return of the refugees scattered round the Middle East, insisting that allowing an influx of so many Palestinians would be suicidal for the Jewish state. Mr Maqdah's document is crucial if peace is to be achieved. If he and his family - and all the other refugee families holding similar documents - can be persuaded to compromise, peace is possible. If they decide they will settle for nothing less than a return to the site of their former villages, any peace settlement is a long way off. Switching reluctantly from the Hizbullah channel, where he was keeping up with the latest incidents in the Palestinian uprising, Mr Maqdah recalls the traumatic events that led to his exile in 1948 during the first Arab-Israeli war. \"The Jews arrived after the second world war. I laughed because I was not used to seeing men and women walking down the road together. The Jews told me they would take our land.\" He said he fled \"because the Jews began occupying our lands, killing our kids. We did not have weapons at the time. The English did not even allow us to carry a small knife.\" Mr Maqdah crossed the border into Lebanon at the height of the fighting. \"I thought I would be away for a week or two and then go back.\" Fifty-three years later, he and 3.7m others live in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza. Does he think he will see his village again? \"I hope so. I hope my death is in Palestine, not here.\" Mr Maqdah left Israel as a widower with eight sons. Today, five generations of his family live in the camp and the family has grown to 180. The love of homeland and hatred of Israel have not lessened with successive generations - the younger members are violently passionate about realising Mr Maqdah's dream. His grandson, Munir al-Maqdah, 41, was born in the camp. \"I love my grandfather. We smell Palestine through my grandfather,\" he said. Munir has only ever seen a video of al-Ghabissiyeh, which has been in ruins since 1948. In theory, the family could move back and rebuild. But that option is not available to most refugees, whose homes have been taken over by Israelis or flattened to make way for high-rise blocks and shopping malls. Mr Maqdah's other village, al- Menshiyyeh, is buried under a military airstrip. Munir is soft-spoken and could pass for an Islamic scholar or poet. In fact, he is a fighter with Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement who left school at the age of 10 to train as a commando for raids into Israel. According to Jordanian and Lebanese newspapers, he is top of the Israeli wanted list. He is also wanted in Jordan where, four months ago, he was sentenced to death in absentia for terrorism. Ein al-Hilweh has a high concentration of guns and men experienced in fighting. The Lebanese army, wary of the Palestinians, has the camp surrounded, controlling access in and out. No cement, cable wire or any other material that might make for permanent homes is allowed in: the Lebanese are adamant that the refugees' presence is temporary. Munir is commander of all the Fatah gunmen in Lebanon. Although nominally under the leadership of Mr Arafat, he publicly opposed him for signing the Oslo agreement with Israel in 1993 and is even more vehemently opposed to the compromises discussed between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the last month. Under the proposed peace deal, only a limited number of refugees would be allowed to return to Israel: the Israelis have so far indicated a willingness to accept about 100,000 but that figure could rise, perhaps to a ceiling of about 300,000. The remainder would resettle in those countries where they live at present, or return to the Palestinian Authority, setting up new homes (and even cities) in the West Bank or Gaza. Compensation would be paid for lost property. Munir is not interested in compensation, resettlement in Lebanon or a move to the Palestinian Authority's West Bank or Gaza. His home, like 98% of Ein al-Hilweh's 80,000 refugees, is in Galilee: that is their soil and they want it back. \"I swear it is not a dream. It is going to happen sooner or later. As they [the Israelis] left like rats from south Lebanon, they will leave the holy land. They should leave it and save their lives before they go back in body bags,\" he says. If the Israelis were prepared to give them back their land, it would not mean the end of Jews in the region, he says. \"Before '48, we used to live with one another. If we go back to the way it was before, then we would be neighbours. We would have no reason to fight them.\" The Israelis have tried several times to assassinate Munir. In 1996, they fired three anti-tank missiles at his home in the camp. He says that if he was killed, he would expect his sons to take up the fight. His nephew, Ahmed, represents the fourth generation. He is 18, still at school, well-educated, speaks good English and his rhetoric is even more hardline than his uncle's. \"I refuse to go to Gaza or the West Bank. I want only to go to my village,\" he says. \"If Arafat makes peace with the Jews, it will be bad. We can't live with the Israelis. We can't trust them.

A sign of wavering? \"No. I can go away for a bit but not for good. If I do not come back, the Palestinian issue will be forgotten.\" There are Palestinians elsewhere who, in quiet moments, are prepared to admit they could be flexible. But there was no willingness to be flexible by anyone interviewed at the Ein al-Hilweh camp. In the plastic bag with the documents of ownership, Mr Maqdah Sr has a recent photograph of himself sitting up in bed, surrounded by the youngest members of his family, the fifth generation, of whom Abdullah, nine months, is the youngest. The children are proudly holding up the documents of land registration. The dream, unreachable as it seems, is passed to the next generation.

The optimism came as Douglas Grant, 50, the stepfather of Eiman April Grant, arrived in the Philippines yesterday, against the advice of the local military negotiators and the Foreign Office. Colonel Saulito Aromin, the commander of the troops on the island of Basilan where Eiman was seized last Wednesday, said last night after a day of negotiating that he hoped the girl would be freed within a few days. \"We are optimistic [of a speedy resolution] because it's a family affair,\" he said. \"We now know this is all about a quarrel between two cousins over a court decision involving a plot of land.\" Col Aromin said he thought Eiman probably did not even realise she had been abducted. \"The girl is in high spirits and good health,\" he said. \"She is completely innocent of what's happening around her, because she is with her uncle.\" Four gunmen burst into the home of the girl's mother, Mina Rasul Grant, and she allegedly was unable to pay them the 100,000 pesos (\u00a31,300) they demanded. At first it had been feared the men were members of an Islamic separatist group. But, said Col Aromin, \"neither the Moro Islamic Liberation Front nor the Abu Sayyaf are involved,\" referring to the two main secessionist movements.

      "body": "<p>Prince Charles yesterday reignited the GM debate by endorsing a revolutionary agricultural system that claims to prove that the 800m facing hunger in developing countries can grow far more food by adopting simple farming techniques than by going down the hi-tech GM route favoured by Tony Blair and US corporations. </p> <p>Addressing a conference at St James's Palace on the benefits of \"sustainable\" agriculture, the prince said: \"Arguments for hi-tech agriculture are increasingly accepted without question, and their possible long term consequences on the environment and economies are not being given sufficient attention. </p> <p>\"One of the most commonly raised arguments raised by those in favour of GMs is that they are necessary to 'feed the world'. But where people are starving, lack of food is rarely the underlying cause. There is a need to create sustainable livelihoods. I would argue for a more balanced approach. Sustainable agriculture provides a pointer to what can be achieved.\" </p> <p>The prince, representatives of large corporations, charities and academies around the world heard that almost 9m poor farmers in more than 50 developing countries were witnessing 50 to 150% yield increases with huge environmental and social benefits. </p> <p>\"Sustainable agriculture\" has been developed largely over the past decade and aims to save water, regenerate soils by using manures, forgo deep ploughing to prevent erosion, reclaim unproductive land, and minimisethe use of pesticides and fertilisers.

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles yesterday reignited the GM debate by endorsing a revolutionary agricultural system that claims to prove that the 800m facing hunger in developing countries can grow far more food by adopting simple farming techniques than by going down the hi-tech GM route favoured by Tony Blair and US corporations. Addressing a conference at St James's Palace on the benefits of \"sustainable\" agriculture, the prince said: \"Arguments for hi-tech agriculture are increasingly accepted without question, and their possible long term consequences on the environment and economies are not being given sufficient attention. \"One of the most commonly raised arguments raised by those in favour of GMs is that they are necessary to 'feed the world'. But where people are starving, lack of food is rarely the underlying cause. There is a need to create sustainable livelihoods. I would argue for a more balanced approach. Sustainable agriculture provides a pointer to what can be achieved.\" The prince, representatives of large corporations, charities and academies around the world heard that almost 9m poor farmers in more than 50 developing countries were witnessing 50 to 150% yield increases with huge environmental and social benefits. \"Sustainable agriculture\" has been developed largely over the past decade and aims to save water, regenerate soils by using manures, forgo deep ploughing to prevent erosion, reclaim unproductive land, and minimisethe use of pesticides and fertilisers. It is close to organic agriculture which the prince has long favoured. The usual claim for GM foods is that they increase yields between 5 to 10%, but, say critics, hi-tech farming may undermine small farmers who mostly save their own seeds and cannot afford the new technology. Leading GM companies and governments have highlighted the growing global food crisis and tried to promote the controversial technology by claiming it could \"feed the world\". Last year, Mr Blair said that GM foods could \"bring benefits for mankind\". The research by Essex University, funded by the Department for International Development, Greenpeace and Bread For the World, collated data from more than 200 projects growing food on more than 29.8m hectares (75m acres), and found \"astonishing\" results. \"We set out to see if farmers can improve food production with cheap, low-cost, locally available technologies and inputs, and whether they can do this without causing further environmental damage,\" said Jules Pretty, director of the University of Essex centre for environment and society. \"We found that for 4.42m small farmers practising sustainable agriculture on 3.58m hectares average food production per household increased 73%.

      "bodyText": "Craig David may not win any points for cutting edge pop, but with four nominations for next month's Brit Awards announced yesterday, the soulful king of Southampton R&amp;B music looks set to shrug off lesser pretenders to his throne. In his nine-month meteoric rise to fame, 19-year-old David has sold an impressive 3.5m albums, and his feat has been acknowledged with nominations in the Best British Male Solo Artist, Best British Dance Act, and Best British Newcomer categories. David, who shot to fame with his single Fill Me In last year, picked up three gongs at the Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards last October. Other acts that feature well in this year's Brit nominations include the newcomers Coldplay, who received three nominations, and the Oxford based Radiohead, whose recent album Kid A has been a smash on both sides of the Atlantic. \"Are they or aren't they about to split up\" girl group All Saints are given a much-needed fillip with a nomination for Best British Group award, though they face stiff competition from acoustic rockers Coldplay, who receive three nominations, Toploader, Moloko, and the mighty Radiohead. Former Housemartin Fat Boy Slim, aka Norman Cook, picks up nominations in the Best British Dance Act and Best British Male Solo Artist categories. Sartorial tastes will be put to the test as quick-change artist Britney Spears, pop stalwart Kylie Minogue, and the ubiquitous Madonna go head to head in the international category. Self-styled bad boy Eminem is also nominated in the Best International Male Solo Artist, along with his angelic opposite Ronan Keating and Latin star Ricky Martin. Also in the running is Dido, nominated in the Best British Female category. Despite selling albums by the thousands in the USA, she has yet to release any singles in Britain. It was also announced yesterday that the Irish rock heroes U2 will be honoured at the Brits ceremony when they receive an award for outstanding contribution to music - something of a change from last year, when the far less experienced Spice Girls were given the award. The ceremony will take place on February 26 and will be hosted by the TV presenters Ant and Dec.

Terrace houses once worth \u00a330,000 are now routinely sold for as little as \u00a33,000. The Seedley and Langworthy Partnership is working to regenerate the areas.

After the latest upward revision of the financial costs of Hatfield, current borrowings stand roughly equal with shareholder funds at around \u00a33bn. So Mr Marshall was telling us yesterday that Railtrack is about to become insolvent. </p> <p>The company requires an early drawdown on the money already promised from the exchequer and needs the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, to cut the remaining straps on the performance/ ticket price straitjacket. Otherwise the board will have to resign, because it will be in breach of companies legislation. </p> <p>What in heaven's name were chairman Sir Philip Beck and the last chief executive, Gerald Corbett, thinking of last autumn when they raised the dividend? </p> <p>Squaring these eye-popping numbers with the stock market's sanguine reaction yesterday (Railtrack's perceived value slipped just 2.5% to 968p) is not easy. As Robert Peston of CSQuest.com, a research service for fund managers, points out, the City is reading statements from the Strategic Rail Authority and Mr Winsor as a declaration that the government will not let Railtrack go bust. But what this is not, Mr Peston adds, is \"a commitment from HMG that it will underwrite the current share price and market capitalisation of \u00a35bn.\" </p> <p>He cannot see Gordon Brown, who actually understands the concept of risk capital, providing the necessary assistance without an upfront contribution from Railtrack's shareholders, and the analyst comes to the equity investment view that \"Railtrack's shares are set to tumble and fast.\" </p> <p>That seems a sensible enough conclusion. But it will not get us to work or home on time. </p> <p>Ideology aside, this business needs a rescue rights issue - the traditional form of which entails a strong outsider (the government) underwriting a heavily discounted offer (at 100p a share, say, on a 10-for-one basis), which provides both a large ownership stake and a big stick with which to beat the management into shape. Mr Brown should just get on with it. </p> <p><strong>Sabre-rattling</strong><br> </p> <p>Bill Richardson has made a habit of high-profile lobbying trips around Opec producers during his tenure as Bill Clinton's energy secretary, but his finely honed diplomatic skills are unlikely to prevent the cartel agreeing production curbs when it meets in Vienna later this week. </p> <p>Indeed, Mr Richardson - in London yesterday after a tour through some of the key Gulf Arab states - conceded as much when he spoke of the need to make any cuts \"as small as possible\". </p> <p>Size will be the crucial factor. Modest reductions at a time when slowing global growth is already expected to reduce demand for oil need not be too damaging to the price, helping to keep supply and demand in line and producing both a profit for Opec and manageable energy costs for industrialised nations. </p> <p>But deep cuts to sustain an artificially high price could tip the world economy into recession and, in the process, deprive the oil producers of the extra revenue they are hoping to raise. </p> <p>The US Federal Reserve cited the impact on growth of escalating energy costs as one of the reasons for its emergency interest rate cut earlier this month but latent inflationary pressure means there is a limit at which it can loosen monetary policy to offset higher oil prices. </p> <p>Opec was sabre-rattling yesterday, threatening to deprive the West of 1.5m barrels a day (about 5% of Opec's total output). While better than talk of cuts of 2m to 3m barrels a day, this is nevertheless a significant reduction which has the potential to do much harm, especially at a time when supplies from Iraq remain subject to the whim of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Inflation figures due out later today in Britain are expected to reveal a sharp drop, largely due to falls in the price of oil and petrol towards the end of last year. But big production curbs by Opec could send it back up again. </p> <p>This need not be too worrying since underlying price pressures remain subdued, but nervousness about the future direction of inflation could be another reason - along with the forthcoming Budget - for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee delaying widely expected interest rate cuts.</p>",

Ideology aside, this business needs a rescue rights issue - the traditional form of which entails a strong outsider (the government) underwriting a heavily discounted offer (at 100p a share, say, on a 10-for-one basis), which provides both a large ownership stake and a big stick with which to beat the management into shape. Mr Brown should just get on with it. Sabre-rattling Bill Richardson has made a habit of high-profile lobbying trips around Opec producers during his tenure as Bill Clinton's energy secretary, but his finely honed diplomatic skills are unlikely to prevent the cartel agreeing production curbs when it meets in Vienna later this week. Indeed, Mr Richardson - in London yesterday after a tour through some of the key Gulf Arab states - conceded as much when he spoke of the need to make any cuts \"as small as possible\". Size will be the crucial factor. Modest reductions at a time when slowing global growth is already expected to reduce demand for oil need not be too damaging to the price, helping to keep supply and demand in line and producing both a profit for Opec and manageable energy costs for industrialised nations. But deep cuts to sustain an artificially high price could tip the world economy into recession and, in the process, deprive the oil producers of the extra revenue they are hoping to raise. The US Federal Reserve cited the impact on growth of escalating energy costs as one of the reasons for its emergency interest rate cut earlier this month but latent inflationary pressure means there is a limit at which it can loosen monetary policy to offset higher oil prices. Opec was sabre-rattling yesterday, threatening to deprive the West of 1.5m barrels a day (about 5% of Opec's total output). While better than talk of cuts of 2m to 3m barrels a day, this is nevertheless a significant reduction which has the potential to do much harm, especially at a time when supplies from Iraq remain subject to the whim of Saddam Hussein. Inflation figures due out later today in Britain are expected to reveal a sharp drop, largely due to falls in the price of oil and petrol towards the end of last year. But big production curbs by Opec could send it back up again. This need not be too worrying since underlying price pressures remain subdued, but nervousness about the future direction of inflation could be another reason - along with the forthcoming Budget - for the Bank of England's monetary policy committee delaying widely expected interest rate cuts.",

The uranium is in powder form and is more radioactive than the material used to make shells and missiles fired in the Gulf and Kosovo wars.

The discovery at dawn yesterday of the body of Roni Tsalah brought an abrupt halt to a week of diplomatic activity, with Israeli and Palestinian officials trying to map out the course of future negotiations after President Bill Clinton leaves office this weekend. It also ended a week-long relative reprieve for the 1.1m people of the Gaza Strip, whose imprisonment by Israel's blockade had been eased as part of the talks. Yesterday, as the runways were shut down at Gaza's airport, border crossings closed, and concrete barricades put up on roads to slice the territory into four pieces, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, cancelled last night's meeting between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. Officials from both sides said later that the talks could resume as early as today. However, with Israeli troops standing by as Jewish mobs clambered over the sand dunes to fire on Palestinian homes in the southern Gaza Strip and smash greenhouses and cars with rifle butts in retaliation for Tsalah's killing, tempers were running high on both sides. Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian stone thrower near the West Bank city of Nablus yesterday, and both sides now dread a new surge in violence that could destroy determined efforts to renew security arrangements and to move forward on negotiations for a final peace settlement. The Israeli army said Tsalah was abducted from a packing plant on Sunday night. His car, which like many settlers' vehicles carried an electronic tracking device, was driven to the Palestinian town of Khan Yunis and set alight. He was shot once in the head, apparently with his own gun. \"It is an unforgivable and abominable crime,\" Mr Barak said in a statement. \"The murderers will not be let off.

      "bodyText": "Equitable clamour grows The parliamentary ombudsman is to be asked to investigate the government's role in the Equitable Life crisis as calls for compensation to affected policyholders grow louder, writes Rupert Jones. It emerged last month that as early as November 1998, the treasury had serious concerns about Equitable's solvency. On December 8 the 239-year-old insurer closed its doors to new business and imposed new conditions on existing policyholders after losing a legal battle over pension promises and then failing to find a buyer. Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs are stepping up their attempts to get a wider inquiry established.Vincent Cable, the Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said yesterday he would be asking the parliamentary ombudsman to look into the role of the various regulators including the treasury and the department of trade and industry. AstraZeneca \u00a343m boost Anglo-Swedish pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca is investing \u00a343m in its Macclesfield plant in northern England, where it makes the schizophrenia drug Seroquel. The new facilities, expected to be operational in 2002, will help meet growing demand for the company's flagship central nervous system product. Seroquel, which belongs to a class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics, registered sales of $293m (\u00a3198m) in the first nine months of last year, 83% up on the same period in 1999. The product, launched in 1997, is also under development for the treatment of psychoses in Alzheimer's disease and for mania. Schneider and Legrand merge French electrical equipment makers Schneider Electric and Legrand announced a \u20ac6.72bn (\u00a34.2bn) merger yesterday to create a world leader in low-voltage electrical components. Schneider, one of the world's largest electrical engineering companies, will pay seven of its shares for every two shares of Legrand, offering a 19.8% premium over Legrand's Friday closing price of \u20ac222.

The deal is expected to generate revenue and cost savings of \u20ac210m from 2003. BAA profits from rail chaos Air operator BAA said the chaos in the nation's railway network contributed to a huge rise in the number of domestic passengers last month. Passenger numbers across BAA's seven UK airports rose to 8.8m in December, an increase of 11.2% compared to the same period last year. The number of people using domestic air routes, excluding the Channel Islands, increased by 14.3%, with around 150,000 more passenger trips than usual recorded during the month. Stansted remained the fastest growing airport in the UK with a passenger increase of 31.1% during the month, to 866,300. London Heathrow and Gatwick recorded an increase of 7.5% and 12.8% respectively. The most buoyant sector was European scheduled traffic, up 8.8%, which accounted for 44.7m passengers.",

GKN has been under pressure from shareholders to provide more transparency and value from an industrial services division which accounted for 27% of its first half operating profit of \u00a3286m. The joint venture pallet rental business of GKN and Brambles, which rents out crates to supermarkets in Europe and North America, has grown faster than other division at both companies.

      "body": "<p>Although a sturdy fast medium bowler for Australia in the mid-1960s - during which period he took 91 wickets - and an Aussie Rules footballer of some note, it was the destiny of Neil Hawke, who has died aged 61, to be remembered for his batting. Shortly after lunch on the third day of the final Test at the Oval in 1964, he edged an outswinger from Fred Trueman to Colin Cowdrey at slip, making the Yorkshireman the first to reach 300 Test wickets.</p> <p>Hawke was a workhorse bowler, a spear carrier to Graham McKenzie's bounding emperor, who hustled his way to the crease with a run that took some starting, but then delivered a \"heavy\" ball from a muscular open-chested action that lent him inswing and, as a variation, more often than not involuntary, a leg cutter that snapped away from the batsman.</p> <p>His wickets, from 27 Tests between his debut against England at Sydney in February 1963 and his final match at Lords in June 1968, came at a cost of 29.41, and he took 458 first-class wickets over a 10-year period. His robust lower order batting gave him a serviceable first-class average of 23.</p> <p>Hawke was born in Cheltenham, South Australia, and educated at Woodville school. He excelled at Aussie Rules and played for the Port Adelaide and the West Torrens sides. In 1963, he was in the South Australia side at the Melbourne cricket ground that defeated Victoria for the first time. It was during a 1966 Rules match that he broke his collar bone, which almost certainly curtailed his time at the top as a cricketer.</p> <p>Hawke signed as a professional cricketer for Western Australia in 1959, moving the following summer to South Australia, for whom he played for eight years before one final season with Tasmania, prior to a sojourn in England.</p> <p>Early in 1963, he took six wickets for South Australia against MCC at Adelaide, a match in which Cowdrey made a triple century, and was chosen against England for the fifth and final Test of the series, taking two for 51 and nought for 38 in a drawn match.</p> <p>He was to wait another year for his second cap, when he was drafted into the second Test of the series against South Africa at the MCG after Ian Meckiff had been no-balled for throwing in the first at Brisbane.

      "bodyText": "Although a sturdy fast medium bowler for Australia in the mid-1960s - during which period he took 91 wickets - and an Aussie Rules footballer of some note, it was the destiny of Neil Hawke, who has died aged 61, to be remembered for his batting. Shortly after lunch on the third day of the final Test at the Oval in 1964, he edged an outswinger from Fred Trueman to Colin Cowdrey at slip, making the Yorkshireman the first to reach 300 Test wickets. Hawke was a workhorse bowler, a spear carrier to Graham McKenzie's bounding emperor, who hustled his way to the crease with a run that took some starting, but then delivered a \"heavy\" ball from a muscular open-chested action that lent him inswing and, as a variation, more often than not involuntary, a leg cutter that snapped away from the batsman. His wickets, from 27 Tests between his debut against England at Sydney in February 1963 and his final match at Lords in June 1968, came at a cost of 29.41, and he took 458 first-class wickets over a 10-year period. His robust lower order batting gave him a serviceable first-class average of 23. Hawke was born in Cheltenham, South Australia, and educated at Woodville school. He excelled at Aussie Rules and played for the Port Adelaide and the West Torrens sides. In 1963, he was in the South Australia side at the Melbourne cricket ground that defeated Victoria for the first time. It was during a 1966 Rules match that he broke his collar bone, which almost certainly curtailed his time at the top as a cricketer. Hawke signed as a professional cricketer for Western Australia in 1959, moving the following summer to South Australia, for whom he played for eight years before one final season with Tasmania, prior to a sojourn in England. Early in 1963, he took six wickets for South Australia against MCC at Adelaide, a match in which Cowdrey made a triple century, and was chosen against England for the fifth and final Test of the series, taking two for 51 and nought for 38 in a drawn match. He was to wait another year for his second cap, when he was drafted into the second Test of the series against South Africa at the MCG after Ian Meckiff had been no-balled for throwing in the first at Brisbane. In the fourth Test, he bowled 39 eight-ball overs, taking six for 139 as South Africa made 595. In the final Test, batting at number 11, he made an undefeated 16 in 75 minutes, to deprive South Africa of the time to chase a modest target and win the series. Only five of Hawke's subsequent 22 Tests were at home; he toured England twice, in 1964 and 1968, as well as India and Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa. He took five wickets against England at Headingley in the first Test of the 1964 series and, at the end, in Trueman's match, managed six for 47, a personal performance bettered only by the seven for 105 he recorded against MJK Smith's side in Sydney in January 1966, a match which England won by an innings. Hawke's bowling peak had occurred in Georgetown nine months previously, when he had match figures of 10 for 115 in a 212-run defeat for Australia. He ended that series in the Caribbean as the highest wicket-taker on either side, with 24 at 21.83. In the years before county cricket accepted overseas players without prequalifying, his all-round ability made him a natural for cricket in the Lancashire leagues in England. He enjoyed several successful seasons with Nelson, after which he still remained in the county until his return to Australia in 1980. By this time though, he was already an ailing man. Following bowel surgery, he contracted an infection, and subsequently fought courageously against kidney failure, liver damage, hepatitis and a dozen heart attacks, enduring more than 30 operations in the process. He is survived by his wife Beverley. Neil Hawke, cricketer, born June 27 1939; died December 25 2000",

The row erupted as fears grew that the \u00a337m rescue package secured by the culture secretary Chris Smith in the wake of the Boyden report, which warned of imminent meltdown if decades of underfunding was not reversed, would not provide the promised panacea. When the windfall was announced in July, Mr Smith said the money should \"try and resolve once and for all the endemic problems of regional producing theatres up and down the country\". But in a letter to Arts Council chairman, Gerry Robinson, obtained by The Guardian, the directors of 10 of the country's top theatres warned that the council was in danger of \"squandering\" the cash by spreading it too thinly throughout what the council called the \"wider theatre ecology\". Sparks later flew when a delegation of directors met Mr Robinson after delivering the letter. There are likely to be further clashes tomorrow when the council briefs regional theatres on their initial plans for the cash. In several strongly worded passages, the letter warned that by \"diluting the government's new money for theatre across the entire sector it could leave unresolved the crisis that was the genesis of the whole exercise. \"This we believe to be misguided and in danger of squandering this unique and unrepeatable opportunity to secure much of the regional producing theatres for the foreseeable future,\" the letter added. A report by management consultant Peter Boyden concluded that many of Britain's 50 surviving regional producing theatres are technically insolvent, others are hanging on by their fingernails while being asked to perform a \"myriad of social and educational tasks\" they are not being properly funded for. He found many produced \"safe\" work to survive as they were unable to commission writing which might attract younger audiences. Yesterday the Arts Council confirmed that \"not everyone would be happy...and not every regional theatre would be a winner.\" when its plans for the extra funding - which does not start until next year - is published in March. There was further disquiet at the revelations that the council intended to give much greater support to children's and ethnic minority theatre and to \"back talent as much as buildings in the theatre of the 21st century\". This was seen as an indication that a sizeable slice of the money could go to touring theatre companies, the majority of which are based in London, rather than to regional producer theatres. The letter from the regional directors points out that the reason so many theatres under perform is that they are \"extremely financially fragile\" and therefore cannot back talent properly. But the letter claims that the regional arts boards, to whom Robinson plans to devolve much of the Arts Council's power and money, are already devising a plethora of \"schemes or bidding initiatives\" for the new money rather than giving it directly to the theatres. A Department of Culture spokesman said the money was never intended solely for the 50 regional producing theatre identified by Boyden. \"You have to look at the whole theatre ecology.

In September 1999 the government instructed schools to maintain an anti-bullying strategy. But a report by the charity Young Voice, published tomorrow, said that the strategies were often inadequate, unknown or not enforced. \"There is a world of difference between having a stated policy and implementing it,\" said Adrienne Katz, one of the authors.

      "body": "<p>Becker versus Becker, the bitter celebrity bust-up which had threatened to turn into a long, highly publicised and diplomatically sensitive legal battle, was yesterday brought to an abrupt end.</p> <p>A court in Munich announced that the retired tennis star, Boris Becker, and his wife, Barbara, had been granted a divorce in a hearing behind closed doors. The speed with which the ruling was made - barely a month after their separation - astonished German family lawyers.</p> <p>A couple must normally be separated for a year before a divorce is granted in Germany. Exceptions can, however, be made if the court is persuaded that a delay would cause hardship.</p> <p>Mr Becker and his lawyers had argued in separate proceedings in the United States that the publicity surrounding the case could increase the security risk to his children. His wife has contested this.</p> <p>Yesterday's ruling, which only Mr Becker was in court to hear, put an end to the most talked about marriage in Germany - an inter-racial partnership that disconcerted many of the tennis ace's fans at first, but which came to be acknowledged as symbolic of an increasingly multi-ethnic society.</p> <p>Its collapse had threatened to take on an even wider dimension. After initially ruling out a divorce and declaring that his wife could have custody of their sons, Mr Becker abruptly changed direction.</p> <p>He filed both for divorce and sole custody of the children. And in a further, and potentially explosive move, he sought help from the German authorities, claiming that his sons had been abducted by their mother.</p> <p>Mrs Becker, the daughter of an American, had flown to the family's holiday home in Florida with her children, Noah Gabriel, six, and Elias Balthasar, one, after the announcement of the separation. Her lawyers counter-claimed that Mr Becker had attempted to kidnap his sons on a Christmas visit to Florida.</p> <p>His application for their return was lodged under the auspices of the 1980 Hague convention, which says that the children of split marriages should be returned to their country of habitual residence.</p> <p>The convention is among the thorniest issues in relations between Germany and the US. America claims that German courts persistently violate the agreement by failing to hand back children abducted to Germany.</p> <p>A US court decision in favour of such a high-profile German celebrity as Mr Becker would almost certainly have prompted heated controversy.</p> <p>Last week, a judge in Miami who had been asked to rule on applications from both parties, gave them 10 days to settle their differences out of court. But there was no indication that they would be divorced before the deadline expired.</p> <p>Mr Becker had earlier failed in a bid to get the proceedings held in private and faced the uneasy prospect of starring in a prolonged, televised courtroom drama.</p> <p>A German press report at the weekend said the Beckers had agreed on arrangements for the children and a financial settlement. Mr Becker's German lawyers confirmed yesterday that the parents would share custody of their children and had agreed on dividing property. But they said that the figures that had been reported were too high.</p> <p>The tabloid Bild am Sonntag reported that the deal involved Becker paying a lump sum of DM30m (almost \u00a310m) to his estranged wife. He was also said to have undertaken to pay for the upbringing of their two children.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would represent a resounding victory for Mrs Becker, who had been guaranteed only DM5m in a prenuptial agreement.</p> <p>Under the reported terms of the agreement, Mrs Becker would have the right to choose whether to live in future at the couple's apartment in an up-market condominium on Fisher Island near Miami or at their villa in Munich.</p> <p>The three-times Wimbledon champion and his wife, a former actress and model, were married in 1993.</p> <p>Despite yesterday's ruling, Mr Becker's legal difficulties are not over. The retired tennis star also faces a paternity suit in London where a woman claims that her nine-month-old daughter is the result of a hurried liaison with Mr Becker in a cubbyhole above a restaurant.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Becker versus Becker, the bitter celebrity bust-up which had threatened to turn into a long, highly publicised and diplomatically sensitive legal battle, was yesterday brought to an abrupt end. A court in Munich announced that the retired tennis star, Boris Becker, and his wife, Barbara, had been granted a divorce in a hearing behind closed doors. The speed with which the ruling was made - barely a month after their separation - astonished German family lawyers. A couple must normally be separated for a year before a divorce is granted in Germany. Exceptions can, however, be made if the court is persuaded that a delay would cause hardship. Mr Becker and his lawyers had argued in separate proceedings in the United States that the publicity surrounding the case could increase the security risk to his children. His wife has contested this. Yesterday's ruling, which only Mr Becker was in court to hear, put an end to the most talked about marriage in Germany - an inter-racial partnership that disconcerted many of the tennis ace's fans at first, but which came to be acknowledged as symbolic of an increasingly multi-ethnic society. Its collapse had threatened to take on an even wider dimension. After initially ruling out a divorce and declaring that his wife could have custody of their sons, Mr Becker abruptly changed direction. He filed both for divorce and sole custody of the children. And in a further, and potentially explosive move, he sought help from the German authorities, claiming that his sons had been abducted by their mother. Mrs Becker, the daughter of an American, had flown to the family's holiday home in Florida with her children, Noah Gabriel, six, and Elias Balthasar, one, after the announcement of the separation. Her lawyers counter-claimed that Mr Becker had attempted to kidnap his sons on a Christmas visit to Florida. His application for their return was lodged under the auspices of the 1980 Hague convention, which says that the children of split marriages should be returned to their country of habitual residence. The convention is among the thorniest issues in relations between Germany and the US. America claims that German courts persistently violate the agreement by failing to hand back children abducted to Germany. A US court decision in favour of such a high-profile German celebrity as Mr Becker would almost certainly have prompted heated controversy. Last week, a judge in Miami who had been asked to rule on applications from both parties, gave them 10 days to settle their differences out of court. But there was no indication that they would be divorced before the deadline expired. Mr Becker had earlier failed in a bid to get the proceedings held in private and faced the uneasy prospect of starring in a prolonged, televised courtroom drama. A German press report at the weekend said the Beckers had agreed on arrangements for the children and a financial settlement. Mr Becker's German lawyers confirmed yesterday that the parents would share custody of their children and had agreed on dividing property. But they said that the figures that had been reported were too high. The tabloid Bild am Sonntag reported that the deal involved Becker paying a lump sum of DM30m (almost \u00a310m) to his estranged wife. He was also said to have undertaken to pay for the upbringing of their two children. Such an arrangement would represent a resounding victory for Mrs Becker, who had been guaranteed only DM5m in a prenuptial agreement. Under the reported terms of the agreement, Mrs Becker would have the right to choose whether to live in future at the couple's apartment in an up-market condominium on Fisher Island near Miami or at their villa in Munich. The three-times Wimbledon champion and his wife, a former actress and model, were married in 1993. Despite yesterday's ruling, Mr Becker's legal difficulties are not over. The retired tennis star also faces a paternity suit in London where a woman claims that her nine-month-old daughter is the result of a hurried liaison with Mr Becker in a cubbyhole above a restaurant.",

Yes, it seems that Scott had rather a chip on his shoulder about being rescued by someone beneath him socially. </p> <p> <b> Frozen out, you could say. So how come it's making waves now? </b> Enough with the puns. It seems the National Maritime Museum is going to restore Colbeck to the roll-call of British polar heroes, for his mission to help Discovery and blast it free of the ice with dynamite. </p> <p> <b> So what's the story? </b> Apparently Colbeck rescued Scott twice. The first time, in 1903, Scott refused assistance and allowed only the infirm - including Ernest Shackleton - to be taken. Scott remained for the winter, continuing his scientific monitoring. </p> <p> <b> How heroic! What about the second rescue? </b> The Discovery found itself in trouble again in 1904, and Colbeck literally blew it out of the water. Until now, Scott's claim that a miraculous swell had freed the ship was believed. </p> <p> <b> So Colbeck's ship has come in? </b> Stop it.

      "bodyText": "As in the daring and courageous polar explorer? Erm, yes, but it turns out brave Captain Scott might not have been such a hero after all. Not another good man gone south. Hmmm . . . it appears he didn't give enough (that is, any) credit to the man who rescued him - one Captain William Colbeck - after his ship became marooned in the Antarctic ice. You mean he gave him the cold shoulder? Very good. Yes, it seems that Scott had rather a chip on his shoulder about being rescued by someone beneath him socially. Frozen out, you could say. So how come it's making waves now? Enough with the puns. It seems the National Maritime Museum is going to restore Colbeck to the roll-call of British polar heroes, for his mission to help Discovery and blast it free of the ice with dynamite. So what's the story? Apparently Colbeck rescued Scott twice. The first time, in 1903, Scott refused assistance and allowed only the infirm - including Ernest Shackleton - to be taken. Scott remained for the winter, continuing his scientific monitoring. How heroic! What about the second rescue? The Discovery found itself in trouble again in 1904, and Colbeck literally blew it out of the water. Until now, Scott's claim that a miraculous swell had freed the ship was believed. So Colbeck's ship has come in? Stop it. Yes, Colbeck is finally getting the recognition he deserves. Photographs showing the ice being blasted - withheld until now under copyright laws because the photographer couldn't be identified - are to be shown at the National Maritime Museum. But it was Scott who was first to the south pole. Well, not quite. He reached his destination only to find he had been beaten by his rival, the Norwegian Roald Amundsen. Oh yes, that's right. And unfortunately he and his team died on the return journey. Do say: \"First the worst, second the best.\" Don't say: \"I'm just going to temporarily erase you from history.

      "body": "<p>The design of the new vocational GCSEs may have looked like a regularising process. After all, we have had GCSEs for many years leading to academic A-levels. Isn't this just a way of providing balance, satisfying the need for an equivalent route up to the new vocational A-level (until recently, the advanced GNVQ). </p> <p>I am not alone in the college sector in believing that for many students this change could actually be a step backwards. Our current qualifications can be seen as a ladder with three rungs or levels. Level 1 provides a starting place for some, though not all, taking formal examinations, level 2 is intermediate and level 3 is the equivalent to advanced level. </p> <p>The secretary of state for education has previously spoken approvingly of the increased number of young people taking level 1 courses. However, the DfEE has recently announced it is asking the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to sweep away level 1 qualifications, such as GNVQ part 1, so that level 1 and level 2 qualifications will be blurred into one. In future, the only way you will get a level 1 is by not doing very well at a level 2 qualification. </p> <p>The DfEE's press release on the new vocational GCSEs appears to be disingenuous, describing the change as to \"put in place a further rung in the coherent ladder of vocational learning\". It appears to me the reverse. A rung is about to be removed. </p> <p>Several thousand young people currently take foundation GNVQ qualifications. For many it is the first time they have achieved a qualification and demonstrated success in learning.

      "bodyText": "The design of the new vocational GCSEs may have looked like a regularising process. After all, we have had GCSEs for many years leading to academic A-levels. Isn't this just a way of providing balance, satisfying the need for an equivalent route up to the new vocational A-level (until recently, the advanced GNVQ). I am not alone in the college sector in believing that for many students this change could actually be a step backwards. Our current qualifications can be seen as a ladder with three rungs or levels. Level 1 provides a starting place for some, though not all, taking formal examinations, level 2 is intermediate and level 3 is the equivalent to advanced level. The secretary of state for education has previously spoken approvingly of the increased number of young people taking level 1 courses. However, the DfEE has recently announced it is asking the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to sweep away level 1 qualifications, such as GNVQ part 1, so that level 1 and level 2 qualifications will be blurred into one. In future, the only way you will get a level 1 is by not doing very well at a level 2 qualification. The DfEE's press release on the new vocational GCSEs appears to be disingenuous, describing the change as to \"put in place a further rung in the coherent ladder of vocational learning\". It appears to me the reverse. A rung is about to be removed. Several thousand young people currently take foundation GNVQ qualifications. For many it is the first time they have achieved a qualification and demonstrated success in learning. The change will reduce opportunities for the next generation of students. The principal of Portsmouth college, Tom Espley, says that level 1 is a great confidence booster for many students and an effective way of recruiting many who will move on to level 2. Getting rid of level 1 will have serious consequences for student retention, he says. We will not only lose the level. The vocational GCSE may well be designed to be more like the academic GCSE, a trend that has been apparent in the increasingly less vocational advanced GNVQ, or vocational A-level, as it is now called. We then lose a different teaching approach. The approach to learning within the foundation GNVQ is different and it often motivates those who have found other forms of study less approachable. \u0095 Judith Norrington is the Association of College's director of curriculum and quality.",

He claims it's also his last British tour, because he's getting on a bit and would rather play golf at his \"French-style chateau\" in Branson, Missouri (one of six houses he owns around the US). Branson is an Ozark Mountains town known as the \"Las Vegas of the Bible Belt\" due to the many middle-of-the-road stars who live and perform there year-round. The Osmond Family Theatre is a mile down Route 76 from Williams. \"They do their show on ice skates,\" he offers with a gently sardonic smile. </p> <p>Williams, 73 last month, does a gruelling 12 shows a week in his own $8m Moon River Theatre, named after his signature tune. Hewn out of Ozark limestone, the building is the only place in Branson to have been featured in Architectural Digest. The foyer boasts a Henry Moore sculpture and works from Williams's collection of Pollocks and De Koonings, although \"not the important ones. The locals don't really appreciate them. They're not into art that much.\" Who'd have thought the man who calls himself Mr Christmas (\"In America I'm Mr Christmas, because I've done six Christmas albums. There's a big market for them there\") was a serious art collector? </p> <p>Saying that, to look at him you wouldn't know he was Mr Christmas. There's not a Pringle sweater to be seen in his hotel suite. No cardigan. No kitsch at all, in fact, unless you count his pale green spectacles, the same shade as his herbal tea. If anything, he is starting to seem like Mr Cool Rockin' Grandad. </p> <p>Unlike most Americans of his vintage, he has even hung onto his figure. \"I've followed the Pritikin low-fat diet for about 20 years. Who wants to be fat? There's so many fat people in America. They're nice people,\" he adds, not wanting this to be taken as criticism. \"They're just fat.\" </p> <p>He has already offended Branson by using the words \"damn\" and \"ass\" in his act. He almost got picketed. So it must be a relief to be in swinging London, eh? He laughs. \"If I was 24, I wouldn't go to Branson, I'd live here or New York. But I have a great life. We got 7,000 tourist buses at my theatre last year. The front door of my house goes onto the golf course and the back looks onto a lake.\" </p> <p>What he doesn't have back home is the admiration of younger people who see him as the emperor of all things easy. The Andy Williams revival is mainly a British phenomenon, but he's happy with that. \"In the States, lounge has different connotations,\" he says. \"I've made jokes that when I get old I'll end up in a seedy hotel lounge in Bakersfield [California] doing a flash act - singing a bit, then wearing a raincoat and flashing 'em.\" He hawhaws fruitily. </p> <p>That's almost shocking coming from a native of Wall Lake, Iowa. Andy started singing there at the age of eight, the youngest member of the four-boy Williams Brothers. During his 1930s youth the family moved to Chicago, Cincinnati and finally Los Angeles, where they got their break doing backing vocals on a Bing Crosby record, Swinging on a Star. He croons mistily into his cup: \"Would you like to swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar?\" </p> <p>No surprise, then, to learn that the adolescent Williams never went through a rebellious phase. \"You mean smoking or drinking? I was doing that anyway; I didn't consider it rebellious. My dad did screw me up, though. His philosophy to get us to work was to say, 'You're not as good as the others out there', so you had a lack of self-esteem as you grew up. I still have it now - that's why I work so hard.\" </p> <p>Has he tried therapy? \"All therapy does is make you forgive your father. It doesn't take away the low self-esteem. It's still in my brain.\" </p> <p>He hit a crisis in the early 1970s when his marriage to his first wife, Claudine Longet, began to unravel. He and Longet, a French singer who was later convicted of the manslaughter of her second husband, were so unhappy that Williams decided to try an unconventional treatment recommended by his doctor. If anyone from Branson is reading, look away now. </p> <p>\"He said, 'You're having some problems, so you might consider LSD treatments. Maybe you and your wife should try it, because you're breaking up.' It was illegal in America because of Timothy Leary, so I went to the Hollywood Hospital in Canada - my wife didn't come - and did it three or four times two days apart. </p> <p>\"It was interesting,\" he remembers dryly, cradling his cup in both hands. \"Some of the trips were good, some bad.

The same subject is not included in the national curriculum yet had 100,000 entries at GCSE last year.

Why has business studies got such a low profile? Is it because of the negative way in which business is portrayed in the media? A recent survey, by the Institute of Economic Affairs, of post-eighteenth century literature reported that, with very few exceptions, writers have presented a negative view of business.

      "body": "<p>Amid the stream of government bumf about the new post-16 regime will soon appear something marked \"protocol\". </p> <p>It sounds terribly important. In fact this key guidance to the 47 Learning and Skills Councils is crucial, because before they can plan any type of coherent training provision they need to talk to all sorts of organisations - from colleges to voluntary and community groups and those in the private sector. </p> <p>Ministers believe the emerging structure will only get a decent foundation to succeed if the Learning and Skills Councils are first equipped with the right language to perform in a collaborative way, and if they have sensitive listening ears to pick up the vital, though often conflicting, signals pointing to strategic training provision. </p> <p>The intended source of intelligence for the councils are the 101 Learning Partnerships being set up across the country. These voluntary bodies have been invested with two important functions, according to Baroness Blackstone. </p> <p>\"Firstly, they will reach out into local communities and find out what local learning and skills needs really are,\" she declares. \"They will be able to provide the new local Learning and Skills Councils with invaluable information and advice on individuals' and employers' needs.\" </p> <p>The Learning Partnerships' second role is to offer a \"forum for collaboration\" so that all the providers can work in a harmonious way, delivering cost-effective training, leaving no glaring gaps and avoiding wasteful duplication. </p> <p>Sounds simple but, inevitably, the picture is quite complicated, mainly because there is no consistent pattern. Some Learning Partnerships - the invention 18 months ago of former lifelong learning minister George Mudie - are in advanced stages of operation, but many more remain non-existent and there is little immediate likelihood of them be setting up. </p> <p>Georgina Cowen of York Consulting Limited, a Leeds-based organisation that is in the middle of a three-year programme to evaluate the Learning Partnerships, cites Wiltshire/Swindon and Bournemouth/Dorset as two areas where the partnership ideal has moved on quickly, and where coherent notions about provision are coming together. \"But in other areas there is confusion,\" she says, \"and the Learning Partnerships have struggled to get their act together.\" </p> <p>Her group, which has been commissioned to do the study on behalf of the DfEE, laments a \"nightmare\" scenario, although she is also at pains to claim there is a lot of positive stuff going on. </p> <p>\"The Learning Partnerships came out at a time when policy was rather confused. But with the new legislation that has changed and, already, the benefits can been seen to be enormous. </p> <p>\"The most exciting thing is the way they can reach out and involve non-traditional training organisations, charities and religious bodies, especially in the area of basic skills teaching. They have the potential to pull these resources together and ensure far more people are engaged with the learning environment,\" she says. </p> <p>According to Dr John Brennan of the Association of Colleges, less than one-third are effective. \"The government is trying to encourage partnerships in all sorts of directions, not just to do with learning. But the reality on the ground is that while some Learning Partnerships have settled down, many others have not done so because there is a lack of commitment or an unwillingness to behave as partners in the new venture.\" </p> <p>Too often, Brennan adds, the rewards are simply not clear enough to justify the time and effort needed by personnel and other senior managers to bang heads and reach rational planning decisions. \"But there are opportunities here as well as threats and anyone failing to adapt will be quickly left behind.\" </p> <p>This is a serious worry for ministers and their official words of encouragement will attempt to raise the game, by pointing out how the Learning Partnerships are seen as a powerful voice, exerting huge influence over the way the Learning and Skills Councils spend the total of some \u00a36bn at their disposal. </p> <p>Part of the problem is uncertainty over who actually takes the initiative.

      "bodyText": "Amid the stream of government bumf about the new post-16 regime will soon appear something marked \"protocol\". It sounds terribly important. In fact this key guidance to the 47 Learning and Skills Councils is crucial, because before they can plan any type of coherent training provision they need to talk to all sorts of organisations - from colleges to voluntary and community groups and those in the private sector. Ministers believe the emerging structure will only get a decent foundation to succeed if the Learning and Skills Councils are first equipped with the right language to perform in a collaborative way, and if they have sensitive listening ears to pick up the vital, though often conflicting, signals pointing to strategic training provision. The intended source of intelligence for the councils are the 101 Learning Partnerships being set up across the country. These voluntary bodies have been invested with two important functions, according to Baroness Blackstone. \"Firstly, they will reach out into local communities and find out what local learning and skills needs really are,\" she declares. \"They will be able to provide the new local Learning and Skills Councils with invaluable information and advice on individuals' and employers' needs.\" The Learning Partnerships' second role is to offer a \"forum for collaboration\" so that all the providers can work in a harmonious way, delivering cost-effective training, leaving no glaring gaps and avoiding wasteful duplication. Sounds simple but, inevitably, the picture is quite complicated, mainly because there is no consistent pattern. Some Learning Partnerships - the invention 18 months ago of former lifelong learning minister George Mudie - are in advanced stages of operation, but many more remain non-existent and there is little immediate likelihood of them be setting up. Georgina Cowen of York Consulting Limited, a Leeds-based organisation that is in the middle of a three-year programme to evaluate the Learning Partnerships, cites Wiltshire/Swindon and Bournemouth/Dorset as two areas where the partnership ideal has moved on quickly, and where coherent notions about provision are coming together. \"But in other areas there is confusion,\" she says, \"and the Learning Partnerships have struggled to get their act together.\" Her group, which has been commissioned to do the study on behalf of the DfEE, laments a \"nightmare\" scenario, although she is also at pains to claim there is a lot of positive stuff going on. \"The Learning Partnerships came out at a time when policy was rather confused. But with the new legislation that has changed and, already, the benefits can been seen to be enormous. \"The most exciting thing is the way they can reach out and involve non-traditional training organisations, charities and religious bodies, especially in the area of basic skills teaching. They have the potential to pull these resources together and ensure far more people are engaged with the learning environment,\" she says. According to Dr John Brennan of the Association of Colleges, less than one-third are effective. \"The government is trying to encourage partnerships in all sorts of directions, not just to do with learning. But the reality on the ground is that while some Learning Partnerships have settled down, many others have not done so because there is a lack of commitment or an unwillingness to behave as partners in the new venture.\" Too often, Brennan adds, the rewards are simply not clear enough to justify the time and effort needed by personnel and other senior managers to bang heads and reach rational planning decisions. \"But there are opportunities here as well as threats and anyone failing to adapt will be quickly left behind.\" This is a serious worry for ministers and their official words of encouragement will attempt to raise the game, by pointing out how the Learning Partnerships are seen as a powerful voice, exerting huge influence over the way the Learning and Skills Councils spend the total of some \u00a36bn at their disposal. Part of the problem is uncertainty over who actually takes the initiative. Words like \"lead body\" are being discouraged since the partnership is anticipated to comprise of equals, with representatives of the local education authority, further education college, local trade unions and private trainers, including employers, all sharing the load. A bit of a bureaucratic burden, particularly as the Learning Partnerships need to move fast if they are to act as a conduit for the Learning and Skills Councils, warns Sue Taylor of the Learning and Skills Development Agency (formerly the Further Education Development Agency). \"They have a very useful part to play in the new structure and some strong relationships have already been formed. Now the task is not just getting up and running, but giving value.\" The big question, however, is how they will dovetail with the Learning and Skills Councils and avoid petty rivalry and other distractions. Ministers think there is no reason why these two \"distinct but complementary\" organisations can't work together to map out the sort of intricate and increasingly flexible learning facilities demanded locally. Certainly the Learning and Skills Councils, usually covering large geographical areas, will need a firm grasp of the local labour market, not least if they are to play their part in meeting national training targets. And they reckon only Learning Partnerships can give this information, the advice will state. Helen Gilchrist, principal of Bury College remains positive. \"We have a history in Bury of talking to each other, so our Learning Partnership has been able to make very good progress in terms of initiatives and promoting post-16 learning, especially among adults,\" she explains. \"It is proving to be a very good vehicle for getting people to work together.\" She also thinks the Learning Partnerships will have an important job carrying forward the recommendations of the new area-wide inspections of learning courses. Tensions will rise, however, when the Learning Partnerships are forced to rationalise some of this provision. \"The test will be when they have to allocate significant amounts of money, but there still fails to be enough to go round everyone,\" Gilchrist warns. \"It has been a frustrating year for Learning Partnerships,\" says Cowen. \"That's why the new guidance from the DfEE is so vitally important. It will give the partnerships the boost that is surely required and help us measure how they are facing the challenge before them.\"",

Six questions were untidily scrawled over two sheets of photocopied A4 paper; words and phrases in the questions had been crossed out and replaced by others written in margins; some parts of questions had been crossed out altogether. The presentation would be considered unsuitable for revision notes, or student answer sheets, let alone the examination itself. </p> <p>To top it all, accompanying one question was a remark (from the university's academic moderating board) complaining that the question was ambiguous and unclear. The question, however, remained unchanged. </p> <p>For a group of the 120 students who took the exam, it was the last straw after a series of disappointments during the four-year course. \"If this had been a one-off incident, we would probably have swallowed it, but there have been problems throughout the four-year course,\" said one of the students, all of whom wish to remain anonymous. </p> <p>The degree produces graduates who can teach outdoor activities such as climbing as well as science, and so teacher-training placements are an integral part of the course. But many students question whether the placements were situated in the ideal places for students to learn their trade. Most schools were more than 50 miles away from Liverpool, and many were under special measures after receiving criticism from teaching inspectors. One student was even placed in a school that was closing two weeks after his practice finished. </p> <p>Then there was the case of the lecturer who didn't turn up to any lectures. Unfortunately, the same lecturer was in charge of a field trip, which was aborted after it was realised only too late that no accommodation had been booked for the students. </p> <p>The university says that it has been unaware of any of these problems, as no complaints have been made up to now. </p> <p>All this changed after that exam. As the students huddled together afterwards to discuss what action to take, they faced a number of dilemmas. Some argued that to speak up would only belittle the degree. But others had had enough. </p> <p>Apart from anything else, the exam paper inevitably affected the performance of many students. \"Question three comes up every year,\" complained one, \"but I didn't answer it because of the remarks over its ambiguity. I answered another question even though I hadn't revised for it.\" </p> <p>The exam paper had not been typed up as part of ongoing industrial action against cuts and reorganisation at Liverpool John Moores. It is a familiar story in the academic world: budget shortfalls, voluntary redundancies, rationalisation. The lecturer who set the exam is a member of the academic union, Natfhe, and delivered it in hand-written form as a protest against the rationalisation. </p> <p>A key accusation from the academic appears to be that the university does not have enough administration staff to type up examination papers - an accusation that is flatly denied by the university management. </p> <p>As far as the students are concerned, the university should not offer such a course if it cannot deliver it. \"It's a bit like me turning up to teach a rock-climbing session and having no rope to teach with,\" one argued. University officials agree that it was unacceptable to present an exam in such a poor state. </p> <p>\"It was absolutely appalling that any students should be presented with a paper like that,\" said Janet Martin, press officer for the university. Martin stressed that this was the action of one member of staff. She also said that no students would suffer, now that they had appealed to the university. </p> <p>A module assessment board will decide what action to take in two weeks' time. No one yet knows how the board will resolve the issue. Will it make the students take the exam again? Should all the marks be upped by 15%, or should everyone receive one score? Whatever the conclusions, the outcome is likely to leave the students with a sour taste in their mouths. </p> <p>There are other complaints concerning the four-year course. At the end of one module, one lecturer told the students that they wouldn't go too far wrong if they revised the 1997 examination paper. He was true to his word: the 1997 paper was all but repeated - with one extra question added. </p> <p>The students also claim that they were told on enrolling that they could choose to finish the degree in three years - without the teacher training element. But this option was later withdrawn. The university, however, denies that it ever offered students such an option. </p> <p>The upshot is that the students will not be able to benefit from the financial incentives that have been introduced by the government to attract more people on to teacher training courses. The government now offers \u00a36,000 for students on one-year PGCE courses. But the students were told in no uncertain terms that they might not be taken on again if they finished the four-year BSc course a year early and tried to reapply for PGCE places at the university. </p> <p>\"We could have been earning a salary which would help to pay off our debts - rather than taking out extra loans,\" said one student. \"The university moved the goal posts after the course started.\" </p> <p>All in all the message from this year's graduates in outdoor and science education is unlikely to chime with the worthy words of the university's chancellor, Cherie Booth QC. \"The success of Liverpool John Moores University is reflected in the thousands of students who graduate every year, each with their own stories of achievement and triumph,\" she says in her introduction to the university. </p> <p>One consolation in this sorry story is that the students were at least not paying fees. \"We are the last year of students who have not had to pay fees,\" said one student. \"If I had had to pay I would now be asking for my money back.\"</p>",

We've won the war economically, politically and militarily.' It was naive, but very worrying.\" </p> <p>That experience six years ago helps to explain why Moore and his staff at the UK Fulbright Commission will watch the transition in Washington DC, and in particular in Congress, with more than academic interest. It did no harm that President Clinton attended Oxford (albeit on a Rhodes rather than a Fulbright grant) or that their programmes are named after their creator Senator William Fulbright - Arkansas's most famous political son before Clinton - but funding for their long-established reciprocal postgraduate scholarship programme comes from Congress. </p> <p>Moore, executive director of the commission since 1993, says: \"People assume we have an endowment. In fact we are publicly funded - two thirds of our money comes from the US and one third from Britain.\" </p> <p>While the proportions were fixed by treaty in 1948, the actual amounts of money are not and the US grant is reviewed annually. It has been static in cash terms - a real terms cut - over the past decade. </p> <p>Many national Fulbright commissions have been cut heavily and Moore reckons Britain has done well to retain its funding in cash terms. Last year's US grant was $845,000. </p> <p>Having a key paymaster prone to mood swings does concentrate the mind: \"We need to convince the people who pay for the programme that they are getting value for money. The best way of doing that is to show that it brings money into the US or makes people abroad think better of it.\" </p> <p>A useful element in this is their US-UK Grant and Education Advisory Programme, reckoned to have been consulted by 70% of the 8,000 British students - each believed to be worth $25,000 a year - currently in the US. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the scholars - this year 22 from the US and 23 from the UK - on the one-year programme are the most important advertisement. British alumni include academics such as Brian Fender, Michael Atiyah and the late Malcolm Bradbury, politician Charles Kennedy, choreographer Siobhan Davies, writer Peter Ackroyd and the architect Richard Rogers. </p> <p>While well established, the programme is far from unchanging. Every two to three years, members of the commission (chaired by the US Embassy's Public Affairs counsellor Pamela Smith) and staff go into retreat to review the programme fully. This has led to a cut in the number of scholarships to a little over 20 in each direction, aimed at making them attractive to the very best candidates. </p> <p>In the 1999 annual report, Moore characterised the identikit Fulbrighter \"a first-class honours degree... but will also have been president of his or her student body, have been leader of a university voluntary organisation and an active participant in team sports.\" </p> <p>One of Moore's most important innovations on joining Fulbright in 1993 was to move away from a heavily academic focus - 80% of the 600 Fulbright alumni in Who's Who are academics - to attract future business leaders as well. Today there are plenty of MBAs, many sponsored by business, among UK scholars. </p> <p>But success also brings new headaches - one issue likely to figure at the next retreat later this year is how to compete in a world in which talented 20-somethings may be offered huge Wall Street salaries. </p> <p>A longer-established problem has been how to counteract Oxbridge dominance on both sides of the Atlantic. Even though the programme is graduate-only, interest in the case of Laura Spence, the sixth-former denied an Oxford place who went instead to Harvard, is seen as one explanation for a 41% increase in hits on the commission's website last year. </p> <p>In large red letters, the site carried the message: \"The Fulbright programme is not just for Oxbridge\". Moore says: \"Not enough of our scholars come from non-Oxbridge universities, but then not enough non-Oxbridge candidates apply.\" </p> <p>Oxbridge accounts for nearly 30 per cent of applicants - as Moore points out \"much higher than the proportion of graduates from Oxbridge\". He thinks one way of selling the programme to other universities would be getting articles about its programme into the student press, but has had little success so far. </p> <p>\"We tend to run into complaints that we are elitist - and of course we are. But we think there are many more students with high academic qualifications, leadership skills and an interest in extracurricular activities outside Oxbridge than in, and we want them.\" </p> <p>Americans come from a wider range of universities, but their applications create a similar problem. Moore explains: \"Most want to go to Oxford. This is partly because they have an excellent operation in the US, and partly because of Clinton.\" </p> <p>But faced with ferocious competition - there are around 700 applications for 20 to 25 places - this may not be a wise choice: \"Somebody who says they want to go to Southampton because of its excellence in oceanography has clearly done their homework and will have the edge in selection over someone who wants to go to Oxford just 'because it's Oxford',\" says Moore. </p> <p>Wherever they go, he has little doubt about the programme's main benefit: \"It isn't just that they learn about another country. They also learn a great deal about their own country and how others see it. And that is particularly valuable for Americans.\" </p> <p><strong> Top minds</strong><br></p> <p><strong> US Fulbright scholars</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Joseph Heller</strong>, author of Catch 22 </p> <p><strong> Daniel Moynihan</strong>, US ambassador to the UN </p> <p><strong> Philip Glass</strong>, composer (to France) </p> <p><strong> Bill Clinton</strong> (not really - he was a Rhodes Scholar) </p> <p> <strong> UK Fulbright scholars </strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Peter Ackroyd</strong>, biographer and novelist (author of Hawksmoor) </p> <p><strong> Sir Michael Atiyah</strong>, former Master of Trinity College, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Malcolm Bradbury</strong>, the late novelist (author of The History Man) </p> <p><strong> Siobhan Davies</strong>, choreographer </p> <p><strong> Charles Kennedy</strong> , leader of the Liberal Democrats </p> <p><strong> Sir Brian Fender</strong>, head of the Higher Education Funding Council for England </p> <p><strong> Lord (Richard) Rogers</strong>, architect </p> <p> \u0095 To apply for a Fulbright scholarship, visit: <a href=\"http://www.fulbright.co.uk\">www.fulbright.co.uk</a></p>",

The best way of doing that is to show that it brings money into the US or makes people abroad think better of it.\" A useful element in this is their US-UK Grant and Education Advisory Programme, reckoned to have been consulted by 70% of the 8,000 British students - each believed to be worth $25,000 a year - currently in the US. Nevertheless, the scholars - this year 22 from the US and 23 from the UK - on the one-year programme are the most important advertisement. British alumni include academics such as Brian Fender, Michael Atiyah and the late Malcolm Bradbury, politician Charles Kennedy, choreographer Siobhan Davies, writer Peter Ackroyd and the architect Richard Rogers. While well established, the programme is far from unchanging. Every two to three years, members of the commission (chaired by the US Embassy's Public Affairs counsellor Pamela Smith) and staff go into retreat to review the programme fully. This has led to a cut in the number of scholarships to a little over 20 in each direction, aimed at making them attractive to the very best candidates. In the 1999 annual report, Moore characterised the identikit Fulbrighter \"a first-class honours degree... but will also have been president of his or her student body, have been leader of a university voluntary organisation and an active participant in team sports.\" One of Moore's most important innovations on joining Fulbright in 1993 was to move away from a heavily academic focus - 80% of the 600 Fulbright alumni in Who's Who are academics - to attract future business leaders as well. Today there are plenty of MBAs, many sponsored by business, among UK scholars. But success also brings new headaches - one issue likely to figure at the next retreat later this year is how to compete in a world in which talented 20-somethings may be offered huge Wall Street salaries. A longer-established problem has been how to counteract Oxbridge dominance on both sides of the Atlantic. Even though the programme is graduate-only, interest in the case of Laura Spence, the sixth-former denied an Oxford place who went instead to Harvard, is seen as one explanation for a 41% increase in hits on the commission's website last year. In large red letters, the site carried the message: \"The Fulbright programme is not just for Oxbridge\". Moore says: \"Not enough of our scholars come from non-Oxbridge universities, but then not enough non-Oxbridge candidates apply.\" Oxbridge accounts for nearly 30 per cent of applicants - as Moore points out \"much higher than the proportion of graduates from Oxbridge\". He thinks one way of selling the programme to other universities would be getting articles about its programme into the student press, but has had little success so far. \"We tend to run into complaints that we are elitist - and of course we are. But we think there are many more students with high academic qualifications, leadership skills and an interest in extracurricular activities outside Oxbridge than in, and we want them.\" Americans come from a wider range of universities, but their applications create a similar problem. Moore explains: \"Most want to go to Oxford. This is partly because they have an excellent operation in the US, and partly because of Clinton.\" But faced with ferocious competition - there are around 700 applications for 20 to 25 places - this may not be a wise choice: \"Somebody who says they want to go to Southampton because of its excellence in oceanography has clearly done their homework and will have the edge in selection over someone who wants to go to Oxford just 'because it's Oxford',\" says Moore. Wherever they go, he has little doubt about the programme's main benefit: \"It isn't just that they learn about another country. They also learn a great deal about their own country and how others see it. And that is particularly valuable for Americans.\" Top minds US Fulbright scholars Joseph Heller, author of Catch 22 Daniel Moynihan, US ambassador to the UN Philip Glass, composer (to France) Bill Clinton (not really - he was a Rhodes Scholar) UK Fulbright scholars Peter Ackroyd, biographer and novelist (author of Hawksmoor) Sir Michael Atiyah, former Master of Trinity College, Cambridge Malcolm Bradbury, the late novelist (author of The History Man) Siobhan Davies, choreographer Charles Kennedy , leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Brian Fender, head of the Higher Education Funding Council for England Lord (Richard) Rogers, architect \u0095 To apply for a Fulbright scholarship, visit: www.fulbright.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Take two nursery schools, two miles apart. On the surface they're much the same. Little feet pound the corridors, excited voices fill the air. Colourful artwork on every wall, coat pegs at child-height. Miniature washrooms, busy noticeboards. Display tables and home corners. Smiling staff, racks of books. </p> <p>But while much unites the private Blundells in Battersea with its state counterpart, Balham Nursery School, a philosophical gulf divides them. Blundells is, in its own motto, \"a traditional teaching nursery\": chat with principal Susan Stevens about the establishment she founded 10 years ago and within minutes she'll have mentioned how advanced her charges are educationally, how \"every child who leaves here has a reading ability two years above his or her actual age\", how the local schools rave about how well her alumni get on. Of course Stevens wants you to know her children are happy and that they have consideration for others and are self-confident: but their academic abilities are her first boast. </p> <p>Contrast Balham, where head Ann Douglas's claim is that, while the children who leave her school may not necessarily be able to read and write, they have learned how to learn, and what the purpose of learning is. Self-confidence and self-respect are the watchwords at Balham: consideration for others, and being aware of others' needs, are given a high priority. Douglas rejects any suggestion that the nursery is \"free and easy\" in allowing children to choose their own activities and in taking a lead from the pupils rather than imposing a structure on their time: in fact, she says, that illusion belies the strong observational basis on which staff operate. Children have the chance to choose what they do, but they are watched and what they choose is noted: if they need help to extend their play, and to move on, it is given. </p> <p>At Blundells the timetable includes French and ballet, and from the age of three children have two half-hour formal lessons a day in which they learn their phonic alphabet, or to recognise their numbers. They complete workbooks in which they practise pre-writing skills and, later, actual writing skills. \"They love it,\" maintains Stevens. \"Often what they achieve is far ahead of our expectations, and of their own and their parents' expectations. There's so much children can learn at this stage - my granddaughter (a pupil at the school) knew her phonic alphabet by the age of two years and two months. We've got two-and-a-half year-olds who can count up to 20 in French, and who know all their colours - even in French!\" </p> <p>All of which makes Blundells sound suspiciously like the sort of establishment that Barry Sheerman MP, chair of the House of Commons education subcommittee, last week denounced as being too formal and pushy. He said he had witnessed three- and four-year-olds sitting in rows tracing the alphabet, and was quoted as saying he'd be \"happy\" to see nurseries of that type go out of business. </p> <p>But whatever the education sub-committee has to say about it, that's unlikely to happen. Blundells and many like it are thriving: Stevens says her waiting list is a mile long and if you don't get your infant down as a small baby, she or he will never get a place. That's because there are plenty of parents around who do like to see concrete results, even from a pre-school. And it isn't just down to boasting: many parents do believe, and Stevens believes this too, that children who have a grounding in the three Rs do better at their primary or prep schools. \"It gives them a flying start,\" she says. </p> <p>Graeme Gaughan agrees. His daughter Mya is three and a half, attends Blundells and is already starting to read and write. \"They give her worksheets and make sure her hand writing is neat and tidy and legible,\" he says. \"At the age of three, I think that's quite acceptable. They put a big emphasis on education and I think it's very sensible. I've a nephew who went to a conventional nursery and I don't think he was anything like as academically prepared for primary school as Mya is going to be. \"I have to admit I was a bit dubious about paying out \u00a360 a term for French lessons, but it has paid off and she can now count to 20 in French and knows a lot of French songs. I didn't have these opportunities when I was a child and it's great to be able to provide them for my own daughter.\" </p> <p>French isn't an option at Balham Nursery. There, staff put a strong emphasis on taking their cue from the children themselves when it comes to setting up themes and activities. Deputy head Helen McAuley explains that just now there's a penchant among the children for making dens and hidey holes in the garden and around the house. \"We could just let them get on with it, or we could ban it - but we do neither,\" she says. \"What we do is follow their cue: if they like hidey holes we'll use them as a tool. So we've made dens around the place and put books and pens and paper in them. We're trying to use what interests them to extend their play and to give them opportunities to learn through it.\" </p> <p>While the outdoor space at Blundells is a small, Tarmac-covered area where children are taken twice a day to play, at Balham Nursery the philosophy is that the large outdoor space the nursery is lucky enough to have is an \"outdoor classroom\". The children have continual access to it (except at mealtimes and group time), and Ann Douglas believes a lot of informal learning goes on there. \"There's so much negotiating, so many opportunities to learn about sharing,\" she says. \"And a child who doesn't want to sit indoors and start writing letters might very well decide to write 'keep out' on the den he's making, or 'one way' on the traffic route he's setting up for the cars. This is learning at their pace, in context. We're not making learning something artificial, in a setting apart from the world they're part of. This is learning grounded in their own experience.\" </p> <p>The milk table sums up the Balham Nursery philosophy. The cartons of milk and a jug of water are set out on a table in the middle of the nursery, and the children have access to it all morning. They have to decide when they want a drink (learning to meet their own needs), take and open a carton and insert a straw (fine motor skills required), then label it with their name (letter recognition). </p> <p>\"Young children don't learn in a subject-based way,\" says Ann Douglas. \"They learn through their senses, and through talking and asking questions. What we're trying to do here is build on what they already know, and to give them an environment in which they feel secure and valued.\" </p> <p>Like Blundells, Balham is over-subscribed. Most parents who've had one child there do all they can to secure a place for younger offspring. \"My eldest daughter went to a private nursery where I think so much of what they did was to make parents feel they were getting their money's worth,\" says Annette, a mother of four. \"She was holding a pen and learning to write at three. At the time I quite liked it, but now she's nine I think it has actually impeded her writing in the long run.

      "bodyText": "Take two nursery schools, two miles apart. On the surface they're much the same. Little feet pound the corridors, excited voices fill the air. Colourful artwork on every wall, coat pegs at child-height. Miniature washrooms, busy noticeboards. Display tables and home corners. Smiling staff, racks of books. But while much unites the private Blundells in Battersea with its state counterpart, Balham Nursery School, a philosophical gulf divides them. Blundells is, in its own motto, \"a traditional teaching nursery\": chat with principal Susan Stevens about the establishment she founded 10 years ago and within minutes she'll have mentioned how advanced her charges are educationally, how \"every child who leaves here has a reading ability two years above his or her actual age\", how the local schools rave about how well her alumni get on. Of course Stevens wants you to know her children are happy and that they have consideration for others and are self-confident: but their academic abilities are her first boast. Contrast Balham, where head Ann Douglas's claim is that, while the children who leave her school may not necessarily be able to read and write, they have learned how to learn, and what the purpose of learning is. Self-confidence and self-respect are the watchwords at Balham: consideration for others, and being aware of others' needs, are given a high priority. Douglas rejects any suggestion that the nursery is \"free and easy\" in allowing children to choose their own activities and in taking a lead from the pupils rather than imposing a structure on their time: in fact, she says, that illusion belies the strong observational basis on which staff operate. Children have the chance to choose what they do, but they are watched and what they choose is noted: if they need help to extend their play, and to move on, it is given. At Blundells the timetable includes French and ballet, and from the age of three children have two half-hour formal lessons a day in which they learn their phonic alphabet, or to recognise their numbers. They complete workbooks in which they practise pre-writing skills and, later, actual writing skills. \"They love it,\" maintains Stevens. \"Often what they achieve is far ahead of our expectations, and of their own and their parents' expectations. There's so much children can learn at this stage - my granddaughter (a pupil at the school) knew her phonic alphabet by the age of two years and two months. We've got two-and-a-half year-olds who can count up to 20 in French, and who know all their colours - even in French!\" All of which makes Blundells sound suspiciously like the sort of establishment that Barry Sheerman MP, chair of the House of Commons education subcommittee, last week denounced as being too formal and pushy. He said he had witnessed three- and four-year-olds sitting in rows tracing the alphabet, and was quoted as saying he'd be \"happy\" to see nurseries of that type go out of business. But whatever the education sub-committee has to say about it, that's unlikely to happen. Blundells and many like it are thriving: Stevens says her waiting list is a mile long and if you don't get your infant down as a small baby, she or he will never get a place. That's because there are plenty of parents around who do like to see concrete results, even from a pre-school. And it isn't just down to boasting: many parents do believe, and Stevens believes this too, that children who have a grounding in the three Rs do better at their primary or prep schools. \"It gives them a flying start,\" she says. Graeme Gaughan agrees. His daughter Mya is three and a half, attends Blundells and is already starting to read and write. \"They give her worksheets and make sure her hand writing is neat and tidy and legible,\" he says. \"At the age of three, I think that's quite acceptable. They put a big emphasis on education and I think it's very sensible. I've a nephew who went to a conventional nursery and I don't think he was anything like as academically prepared for primary school as Mya is going to be. \"I have to admit I was a bit dubious about paying out \u00a360 a term for French lessons, but it has paid off and she can now count to 20 in French and knows a lot of French songs. I didn't have these opportunities when I was a child and it's great to be able to provide them for my own daughter.\" French isn't an option at Balham Nursery. There, staff put a strong emphasis on taking their cue from the children themselves when it comes to setting up themes and activities. Deputy head Helen McAuley explains that just now there's a penchant among the children for making dens and hidey holes in the garden and around the house. \"We could just let them get on with it, or we could ban it - but we do neither,\" she says. \"What we do is follow their cue: if they like hidey holes we'll use them as a tool. So we've made dens around the place and put books and pens and paper in them. We're trying to use what interests them to extend their play and to give them opportunities to learn through it.\" While the outdoor space at Blundells is a small, Tarmac-covered area where children are taken twice a day to play, at Balham Nursery the philosophy is that the large outdoor space the nursery is lucky enough to have is an \"outdoor classroom\". The children have continual access to it (except at mealtimes and group time), and Ann Douglas believes a lot of informal learning goes on there. \"There's so much negotiating, so many opportunities to learn about sharing,\" she says. \"And a child who doesn't want to sit indoors and start writing letters might very well decide to write 'keep out' on the den he's making, or 'one way' on the traffic route he's setting up for the cars. This is learning at their pace, in context. We're not making learning something artificial, in a setting apart from the world they're part of. This is learning grounded in their own experience.\" The milk table sums up the Balham Nursery philosophy. The cartons of milk and a jug of water are set out on a table in the middle of the nursery, and the children have access to it all morning. They have to decide when they want a drink (learning to meet their own needs), take and open a carton and insert a straw (fine motor skills required), then label it with their name (letter recognition). \"Young children don't learn in a subject-based way,\" says Ann Douglas. \"They learn through their senses, and through talking and asking questions. What we're trying to do here is build on what they already know, and to give them an environment in which they feel secure and valued.\" Like Blundells, Balham is over-subscribed. Most parents who've had one child there do all they can to secure a place for younger offspring. \"My eldest daughter went to a private nursery where I think so much of what they did was to make parents feel they were getting their money's worth,\" says Annette, a mother of four. \"She was holding a pen and learning to write at three. At the time I quite liked it, but now she's nine I think it has actually impeded her writing in the long run. At Balham Nursery, where my son went, it looks like it's all play but I think there's a lot more going on than that. Helen said to me once that it's no good sitting them down and forcing them to write at that age - what you need to do is introduce writing as a purposeful play activity, like writing in the home corner, and I do feel that's the right approach. Dominic is in reception class now and he's really enthusiastic about learning and about reading and writing, so it certainly seems to have worked.\" Margaret Lochrie, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, shares many of Annette's reservations about formal pre-schools. \"To some extent it's horses for courses - there's certainly a huge range of ability among three- and four-year-olds,\" she admits. \"But we're against the over-formalised approach. Giving children of three worksheets is a waste of time when they can't even hold a pencil.

Our real concern is that these things are being introduced before the basics have been established, and there's evidence that doing that may be counter-productive, or possibly even harmful. \"We're not saying formal learning for pre-schoolers should never happen, but you've got to be very, very careful about it. In general, one-to-one attention and the opportunity for lots of play is far more important at this stage than phonics and number work.\"",

I'm late, I've got to... Luvverly, luvverly job. Yes, thank you, now I must... You make beer then (hic)? Yes, that's right, now... How djew get tha luvverly job? Look, I've got to... No, go on, tell us. How djew become a brewery then? Brewer! The word's brewer. Thash right. An' how djew get that then? Actually my official title is technical brewer. Ooooh! Tenticle brewer, ay? Washthat then? Well, it recognises that brewing is a biochemical process. Yeah. Often tashtes like it, in all. I mean it involves mixing malted barley and other cereals with water, boiling the mixture with hops, cooling it and then fermenting with yeast. This is a much simplified explanation but it highlights the many processes involved. Jolly goo'. But what djew do? In large breweries the technical brewer takes responsibility for one aspect of the brewing process. In small speciality breweries he or she is likely to take overall responsibility for the whole process, including quality assurance, research and product development. Ver' good. And how djew get into that? Entrants to the industry are predominantly graduates in chemistry, biotechnology, biochemistry or microbiology. Wha' just to make a pint of beer? Certainly. What about training? People starting out in the brewing industry are expected to gain two professional qualifications set by the Institute of Brewing. Wharrare they? The Associate Membership Examination, which covers all the major scientific and engineering processes involved in brewing and requires a mixture of academic study and on the job training. On completion the candidate becomes an associate member of the Institute of Brewing. The Diploma master brewer, an expert level qualification which follows on from the Associate Membership Examination is usually taken after at least four years in the industry. Wharrabout pay?

Even when there is a clear diagnosis and agreement that an immediate admission is required (for instance within 24 hours), it regularly takes more than three days to find a CAMHS bed and \"two to three weeks to secure a bed is not unusual\", says the report.</p> <p>YoungMinds director Peter Wilson said: \"We have seen a rise of up to 20% in referrals of children with mental health problems in some areas and the reasons for them are more complex now.\"</p> <p>\"The adult mental health lobby is very strong and this is one of the reasons why children's services have suffered. There is also a perceived lower status of consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists than adult psychiatrists and this is one factor in explaining why there are shortages in some areas.</p> <p>\"Extending the NSF to children's services would be a major step forward in improving children's mental health services,\" Mr Wilson added.</p> <p>Jan Douglas, head of children's services at Middlesbrough council in Teesside, who helped to draw up the report, said: \"CAMHS are vastly under-resourced and another problem is the recruitment and retention of qualified staff.</p> <p>\"A third issue is the skill mix between health and social services because services can vary depending on how the two agencies collaborate in a geographical area. There is definitely a shortage of consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists and perhaps it is not seen as a very attractive post as they are under pressure from parents, GPs and social services.</p> <p>\"There has been some extra money in the past year from the government for developing children's services and we received \u00a328,000, which is not much. We used that to fund a community psychiatric nurse to liaise with CAMHS professionals. In contrast, if we need to place a child in secure accommodation, it will cost us around \u00a32,000 a week, so any extra money would have to be substantial to make a difference.\"</p> <p>Disorders dealt with by CAMHS range from the emotional such as phobias, anxiety and depression, to conduct disorders such as stealing, fire-setting and anti-social behaviour, and developmental disorders such as delays in acquiring skills such as speech.</p> <p>Around 10% of five to 15-year-olds in England, Scotland and Wales have some type of mental disorder, according to the largest national survey of its kind carried out by the Office for National Statistics in 1999. Children of families in social class 5 (unskilled occupations) were around three times more likely to have a mental health problem than those in social class 1 (professionals) - 15% compared with 5%.</p>",

YoungMinds director Peter Wilson said: \"We have seen a rise of up to 20% in referrals of children with mental health problems in some areas and the reasons for them are more complex now.\" \"The adult mental health lobby is very strong and this is one of the reasons why children's services have suffered. There is also a perceived lower status of consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists than adult psychiatrists and this is one factor in explaining why there are shortages in some areas. \"Extending the NSF to children's services would be a major step forward in improving children's mental health services,\" Mr Wilson added. Jan Douglas, head of children's services at Middlesbrough council in Teesside, who helped to draw up the report, said: \"CAMHS are vastly under-resourced and another problem is the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. \"A third issue is the skill mix between health and social services because services can vary depending on how the two agencies collaborate in a geographical area. There is definitely a shortage of consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists and perhaps it is not seen as a very attractive post as they are under pressure from parents, GPs and social services. \"There has been some extra money in the past year from the government for developing children's services and we received \u00a328,000, which is not much. We used that to fund a community psychiatric nurse to liaise with CAMHS professionals. In contrast, if we need to place a child in secure accommodation, it will cost us around \u00a32,000 a week, so any extra money would have to be substantial to make a difference.\" Disorders dealt with by CAMHS range from the emotional such as phobias, anxiety and depression, to conduct disorders such as stealing, fire-setting and anti-social behaviour, and developmental disorders such as delays in acquiring skills such as speech. Around 10% of five to 15-year-olds in England, Scotland and Wales have some type of mental disorder, according to the largest national survey of its kind carried out by the Office for National Statistics in 1999. Children of families in social class 5 (unskilled occupations) were around three times more likely to have a mental health problem than those in social class 1 (professionals) - 15% compared with 5%.",

      "body": "<p>The exhibition Temporary Accommodation opened at the Whitechapel Art Gallery last Friday. I have already visited the show three times. I just can't get enough of it. I keep going back to make sure that it was only a dream after all, and because I am a masochist. </p> <p>Temporary Accommodation is one of those narcissistic projects that institutions like to mount now and again just to prove how liberal and open they are, even to the talentless, and to demonstrate how radical and in touch with the young, the vital, the iconoclastic they can be. </p> <p>In the small gallery at the top of the stairs in the Whitechapel, there are people working at computers, furrowing their brows, having phone conversations. Apparently, they are busy arranging cake-making competitions, hands-on healing sessions and talks by Christian preachers. They're setting-up language classes - Latin for beginners, Japanese, True Danish - and generally hanging about looking purposeful. These extra-curricular activities are outlined in a depressing little programme that also includes spoof horoscopes and adverts. </p> <p>You walk through, and try not to make eye-contact. This feeble-minded charade of inclusiveness makes me want to puke. Somewhere amidst this ridiculous programme is a series of screenings of films by Bas Jan Ader, who died during a sailing trip across the Atlantic in 1975. His work meditated on the relation between art and life. But let's not confuse them, especially when the life on offer here seems so lousy. </p> <p>Further on, a man called Simon Faithfull is doing pixillated drawings on the walls, on sheets of plastic and on boards. He has cluttered his space with ladders, powerful lights and a home-made polythene hot air balloon, which wafts about on its tether above a naked gas jet. The balloon has gone up all right. The drawings, so far, show a pair of binoculars, surveillance cameras, views of the traffic on Whitechapel High Street, a naked tree. Looking, I go all empty and dead inside. I try to find the \"strong metaphorical qualities\" signposted in the press release, but I can't - or won't, more like, because a refusal to engage is as much my right as anyone else's. </p> <p>Tariq Alvi, born in Newcastle, raised in Newham, currently a resident of Rotterdam, occupies the entire ground floor gallery. Alvi is 35, and this is only his second solo show, anywhere. Alvi is both showing completed work and treating the gallery as his studio - or, rather, giving the impression that he's working here. It is difficult to tell what is complete, what is in progress, what is raw material, and what is merely en route to the rubbish bin. On the press day last Thursday, there was a man's beige suit folded on the floor. By Saturday the suit had been screwed to a wooden board. Is this a Saint Sebastian gag? Deconstruct: Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, suit drilled with screws; screws, screwing; beige suit, man; Catholic martyr, gay icon. Or perhaps not. </p> <p>Alvi's work is all in a state of suspension, or flux, between one state and another. That is how he works, that is the thing that he does. He pins things up above his mantelpiece and over his desk, he covers tables with a litter of porn mags, newspaper cuttings, photos and drawing pins, glue-sticks and plastic beads. Lengths of chain and all those pins add a frisson of something or other, something \"Ouch!\" and something \"Ooh!\" Here are actual noticeboards and life-size photographs of the walls of the artist's studio-apartment, where Post-Its and photocopied Spanish still lifes are stuck next to private letters and Hugo Boss advertising beefcake. There's club flyers and gallery invites, postcards, doodles, phone numbers. Some of this stuff is displayed on false walls angled out into the gallery, so you wedge yourself in there to get a good look. </p> <p>The problem is that I don't really care about any of it, even as I try to get a fix on Alvi from the accumulated evidence. He goes to clubs. People write to him. He likes art, he works hard at his career. He's gay, I guess, intelligent and inquisitive. He prefers clutter to emptiness. He has a nice decorative sense and an eye for colour. He takes maps of cities and fills in the squares and streets and parks with coloured pens, turning them into pretty pictures (nothing wrong with that) that look like clothing in paintings by Klimt. He morphs images of male lions together, to make it look as if they're humping. He gives us shredded slices of his life. </p> <p>I imagine Alvi concentrating, scissors in hand, nursing his enthusiasms. It all looks a bit stoned and fitful and driven by an entirely private logic. I feel a vague echo of Alighiero e Boetti and of Daniel Spoerri, updated, but none of it takes me very far. The stuff Alvi collects and snips and sticks together is on its migratory route between its point of origin and its ultimate resting place - either as art or rubbish. This is a slim space in which to operate, an entirely theatrical demonstration of artistic doubt and aspiration. </p> <p>Alvi surely knows this as he sieves and screws and glues away. He cuts away at a catalogue of mail-order jewellery, snipping out bracelets and eternity rings for a pinboard arrangement. He cuts newspaper footage into little ticker-tape insects - cockroaches and bugs and fanciful spiders - turning tabloid columns into parasitic bugs. His work tables, with their cargos of half-finished things, magazines and materials, are heavy with clues and potential, but my voyeuristic interest in his working process goes unrewarded. The thousands of torn-up shreds of paper that litter the gallery floor make me think of entropy, my energy slowly ebbing away. One thousand snapshots of rubbish and graffiti and corners in Amsterdam's red-light district fill a whole wall, but I can't recall a single detail. </p> <p>GK Chesterton, in one of the more bizarre of his 1920s Father Brown stories (in which an unassuming Roman Catholic priest played amateur sleuth) wrote something to the effect that the criminal was like the artist, the detective like the critic. We can look at Alvi's show as the scene of the crime, but what crime was it? </p> <p>Back upstairs, Szuper Gallery, a group originally from Munich but now London-based, show some videos. One documents a party staged for the camera, with drinks and music and animated conversation. Under the footage runs a text, detailing a real-life art heist that took place in Venice last year. A gang set up a very sophisticated Mametian con trick and fooled at least three dealers into parting with valuable paintings before disappearing. </p> <p>The heist - which involved a fake family apartment, a dying grandmother, an absent collector and his garrulous, plausible son - was better than anything in the exhibition, and better yet than Szuper Gallery's description of it. The con showed daring, guile, an understanding of art dealer mentality, a sense of theatre and staging, and loads and loads of front. The crims may have been con artists, but they were artists just the same. The criminal here is only a curator. </p> <p>Temporary Accommodation, which has been curated by Andrea Tarsia, will be forgotten, as just about the dumbest show the Whitechapel has ever held. Someone, I suppose, will try to tell me it was \"brave\". </p> <p>In March the Whitechapel will celebrate a full century in its current location. A moment to pause, then, as public spaces all over London deal with what one might call the Tate Effect, and are forced to redefine their individuality, their particular slant on current art in the light of Tate Modern's success. Temporary Accommodation might have seemed like a bright idea to someone, but it is ghastly and amateurish in just about every way. Curatorial spin and theoretical fuzzy logic can't save it. Later this year, Iwona Blazwick, lately head of exhibitions at Tate Modern, takes over the reins from Catherine Lampert as director of the Whitechapel. Let's move on. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Temporary Accommodation: Alvi, Belt, Faithfull and Szuper Gallery is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7888) until March 4.</p>",

Somewhere amidst this ridiculous programme is a series of screenings of films by Bas Jan Ader, who died during a sailing trip across the Atlantic in 1975. His work meditated on the relation between art and life. But let's not confuse them, especially when the life on offer here seems so lousy. Further on, a man called Simon Faithfull is doing pixillated drawings on the walls, on sheets of plastic and on boards. He has cluttered his space with ladders, powerful lights and a home-made polythene hot air balloon, which wafts about on its tether above a naked gas jet. The balloon has gone up all right. The drawings, so far, show a pair of binoculars, surveillance cameras, views of the traffic on Whitechapel High Street, a naked tree. Looking, I go all empty and dead inside. I try to find the \"strong metaphorical qualities\" signposted in the press release, but I can't - or won't, more like, because a refusal to engage is as much my right as anyone else's. Tariq Alvi, born in Newcastle, raised in Newham, currently a resident of Rotterdam, occupies the entire ground floor gallery. Alvi is 35, and this is only his second solo show, anywhere. Alvi is both showing completed work and treating the gallery as his studio - or, rather, giving the impression that he's working here. It is difficult to tell what is complete, what is in progress, what is raw material, and what is merely en route to the rubbish bin. On the press day last Thursday, there was a man's beige suit folded on the floor. By Saturday the suit had been screwed to a wooden board. Is this a Saint Sebastian gag? Deconstruct: Saint Sebastian pierced by arrows, suit drilled with screws; screws, screwing; beige suit, man; Catholic martyr, gay icon. Or perhaps not. Alvi's work is all in a state of suspension, or flux, between one state and another. That is how he works, that is the thing that he does. He pins things up above his mantelpiece and over his desk, he covers tables with a litter of porn mags, newspaper cuttings, photos and drawing pins, glue-sticks and plastic beads. Lengths of chain and all those pins add a frisson of something or other, something \"Ouch!\" and something \"Ooh!\" Here are actual noticeboards and life-size photographs of the walls of the artist's studio-apartment, where Post-Its and photocopied Spanish still lifes are stuck next to private letters and Hugo Boss advertising beefcake. There's club flyers and gallery invites, postcards, doodles, phone numbers. Some of this stuff is displayed on false walls angled out into the gallery, so you wedge yourself in there to get a good look. The problem is that I don't really care about any of it, even as I try to get a fix on Alvi from the accumulated evidence. He goes to clubs. People write to him. He likes art, he works hard at his career. He's gay, I guess, intelligent and inquisitive. He prefers clutter to emptiness. He has a nice decorative sense and an eye for colour. He takes maps of cities and fills in the squares and streets and parks with coloured pens, turning them into pretty pictures (nothing wrong with that) that look like clothing in paintings by Klimt. He morphs images of male lions together, to make it look as if they're humping. He gives us shredded slices of his life. I imagine Alvi concentrating, scissors in hand, nursing his enthusiasms. It all looks a bit stoned and fitful and driven by an entirely private logic. I feel a vague echo of Alighiero e Boetti and of Daniel Spoerri, updated, but none of it takes me very far. The stuff Alvi collects and snips and sticks together is on its migratory route between its point of origin and its ultimate resting place - either as art or rubbish. This is a slim space in which to operate, an entirely theatrical demonstration of artistic doubt and aspiration. Alvi surely knows this as he sieves and screws and glues away. He cuts away at a catalogue of mail-order jewellery, snipping out bracelets and eternity rings for a pinboard arrangement. He cuts newspaper footage into little ticker-tape insects - cockroaches and bugs and fanciful spiders - turning tabloid columns into parasitic bugs. His work tables, with their cargos of half-finished things, magazines and materials, are heavy with clues and potential, but my voyeuristic interest in his working process goes unrewarded. The thousands of torn-up shreds of paper that litter the gallery floor make me think of entropy, my energy slowly ebbing away. One thousand snapshots of rubbish and graffiti and corners in Amsterdam's red-light district fill a whole wall, but I can't recall a single detail. GK Chesterton, in one of the more bizarre of his 1920s Father Brown stories (in which an unassuming Roman Catholic priest played amateur sleuth) wrote something to the effect that the criminal was like the artist, the detective like the critic. We can look at Alvi's show as the scene of the crime, but what crime was it? Back upstairs, Szuper Gallery, a group originally from Munich but now London-based, show some videos. One documents a party staged for the camera, with drinks and music and animated conversation. Under the footage runs a text, detailing a real-life art heist that took place in Venice last year. A gang set up a very sophisticated Mametian con trick and fooled at least three dealers into parting with valuable paintings before disappearing. The heist - which involved a fake family apartment, a dying grandmother, an absent collector and his garrulous, plausible son - was better than anything in the exhibition, and better yet than Szuper Gallery's description of it. The con showed daring, guile, an understanding of art dealer mentality, a sense of theatre and staging, and loads and loads of front. The crims may have been con artists, but they were artists just the same. The criminal here is only a curator. Temporary Accommodation, which has been curated by Andrea Tarsia, will be forgotten, as just about the dumbest show the Whitechapel has ever held. Someone, I suppose, will try to tell me it was \"brave\". In March the Whitechapel will celebrate a full century in its current location. A moment to pause, then, as public spaces all over London deal with what one might call the Tate Effect, and are forced to redefine their individuality, their particular slant on current art in the light of Tate Modern's success. Temporary Accommodation might have seemed like a bright idea to someone, but it is ghastly and amateurish in just about every way. Curatorial spin and theoretical fuzzy logic can't save it. Later this year, Iwona Blazwick, lately head of exhibitions at Tate Modern, takes over the reins from Catherine Lampert as director of the Whitechapel. Let's move on. \u00b7 Temporary Accommodation: Alvi, Belt, Faithfull and Szuper Gallery is at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7888) until March 4.",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of investors holding tax-free Tessa accounts could miss out on massive amounts of interest unless they transfer their money to different accounts by the end of the tax year.</p> <p>Alliance &amp; Leicester, has conducted research among 2,000 Tessa savers and says two out of three of them have no plans to transfer their funds. Only 14% said they would move their account, while 11% said they would switch providers and 2% wanted to spend the lot. According to Alliance &amp; Leicester, they could lose out on some \u00a32 million a week in lost interest.</p> <p>The complex rules surrounding Tessas are causing huge headaches for many holders and the rules for transfer are so difficult to understand that even some bank and building society staff are confused. </p> <p>Tessas are tax-exempt special savings accounts, launched by John Major's Conservative government 10 years ago. Around five million savers put around \u00a330 billion into these accounts. They could keep up to \u00a39,000 there and keep the interest tax free if it was left untouched for five years. When the Tessa matured, the capital - but not the interest - could be rolled over for another five years.</p> <p>The Labour government replaced Tessas with individual savings accounts (Isa) where up to \u00a33,000 a year in cash can be invested. While this is less than Tessas, money can be withdrawn without penalty. Although Tessas can no longer be set up, anyone who started one was allowed to complete it. This year they are now starting to mature with an estimated \u00a321 billion flowing back to savers this year.</p> <p>The recommended route for those with Tessa accounts is to open a Tessa-only Isa. Up to \u00a39,000 can be invested in these. But, you can only invest the amount of capital you put in - not the interest. Money can be withdrawn from these at any time. A key benefit of transferring your Tessa capital to a Tessa-only Isa is that it has no effect on your annual Isa allowance of \u00a37,000.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of investors holding tax-free Tessa accounts could miss out on massive amounts of interest unless they transfer their money to different accounts by the end of the tax year. Alliance &amp; Leicester, has conducted research among 2,000 Tessa savers and says two out of three of them have no plans to transfer their funds. Only 14% said they would move their account, while 11% said they would switch providers and 2% wanted to spend the lot. According to Alliance &amp; Leicester, they could lose out on some \u00a32 million a week in lost interest. The complex rules surrounding Tessas are causing huge headaches for many holders and the rules for transfer are so difficult to understand that even some bank and building society staff are confused. Tessas are tax-exempt special savings accounts, launched by John Major's Conservative government 10 years ago. Around five million savers put around \u00a330 billion into these accounts. They could keep up to \u00a39,000 there and keep the interest tax free if it was left untouched for five years. When the Tessa matured, the capital - but not the interest - could be rolled over for another five years. The Labour government replaced Tessas with individual savings accounts (Isa) where up to \u00a33,000 a year in cash can be invested. While this is less than Tessas, money can be withdrawn without penalty. Although Tessas can no longer be set up, anyone who started one was allowed to complete it. This year they are now starting to mature with an estimated \u00a321 billion flowing back to savers this year. The recommended route for those with Tessa accounts is to open a Tessa-only Isa. Up to \u00a39,000 can be invested in these. But, you can only invest the amount of capital you put in - not the interest. Money can be withdrawn from these at any time. A key benefit of transferring your Tessa capital to a Tessa-only Isa is that it has no effect on your annual Isa allowance of \u00a37,000. That means that someone with a Tessa maturing this year potentially can take advantage of up to \u00a316,000 in tax-free savings. But, Tessa savers must move their money within six months after it matures. If not, they will lose their tax-free allowance. Selecting where to put your Tessa proceeds is not easy, as there are some competitive rates available.

      "body": "<p>The significance of Seeking the Soul, the title of the BBC's Alfred Schnittke weekend, became increasingly apparent as the final day wore on. The culminating work was the Faust Cantata, a drama of perdition, of the irretrievable loss of the human soul into a void of silence. </p> <p>\"Faust is the theme of my whole life,\" Schnittke is reported as saying, \"and I am already afraid of it.\" </p> <p>A defining moment of his adolescence was his discovery of Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus, the novel about a composer whose music issues from the gulf that is his own soullessness. Schnittke sets a Faust text used by Mann's fictional character, filling the gulf with his own garish amalgam of memory, allusion and reminiscence. The chorus pontificate in Brahmsian fashion. Faust is damned to a tango - part Kurt Weill, part rock - sung here by Susan Bickley, her voice emerging from cavernous depths and rising to ribald shrieks of diablerie. At the end the music ticks away into percussive nothingness as the lights dim and performers and audience are dissolved into darkness. </p> <p>Leonard Slatkin conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with a dreadful relish, prefacing the work with the Third Symphony, written for the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1981 to celebrate 300 years of the Austro-German symphonic tradition. Once again, sound heaves itself out of a silence, gradually coalescing into a Brucknerian, architectonic structure. Yet, despite the grandeur, nihilism pervades as the allusions and reminiscences proliferate and shift. Mozartian piano swirls are suddenly fractured by the eruption of violent sonic hell. Symphonic tradition itself seems imperilled in Schnittke's music, which fascinates and unnerves through its very lack of centredness and certainty. </p> <p>The mordant bleakness of his vision was again emphasised in a lunchtime concert in the chill of St Giles's Church, Cripplegate, when Gidon Kremer, Schnittke's friend and advocate, led a series of works for string ensemble. Ula Ulijana on the viola and Marta Sudraba on the cello joined him for the String Trio. Commissioned to commemorate the centenary of Berg's birth, it subjects a fragment of melody that is almost Happy Birthday To You to bleak chromatic contortions, as if warning an infant of the perils of existence. The same soloists played the Concerto for Three, which allows each player a moment of brief, magisterial assertion before everything is swept away in violence. </p> <p>Yet there are moments of redemption in Schnittke that overturn the sombreness of it all. At a late afternoon concert, with the BBC Philharmonic and Vassily Sinaisky, we were allowed to hear what is probably Schnittke's greatest score, his Second Cello Concerto, with the phenomenal Torlief Thedeen as soloist. The work culminates in an overwhelming passacaglia that echoes the finales of both Brahms's Fourth Symphony and Berg's Violin Concerto. Despite some interruptions of coruscating terror, it progresses with ritual solemnity towards a genuine, numinous transcendence. Just for once, you feel that the terrible void has finally been filled.</p>",

The culminating work was the Faust Cantata, a drama of perdition, of the irretrievable loss of the human soul into a void of silence. \"Faust is the theme of my whole life,\" Schnittke is reported as saying, \"and I am already afraid of it.\" A defining moment of his adolescence was his discovery of Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus, the novel about a composer whose music issues from the gulf that is his own soullessness. Schnittke sets a Faust text used by Mann's fictional character, filling the gulf with his own garish amalgam of memory, allusion and reminiscence. The chorus pontificate in Brahmsian fashion. Faust is damned to a tango - part Kurt Weill, part rock - sung here by Susan Bickley, her voice emerging from cavernous depths and rising to ribald shrieks of diablerie. At the end the music ticks away into percussive nothingness as the lights dim and performers and audience are dissolved into darkness. Leonard Slatkin conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus with a dreadful relish, prefacing the work with the Third Symphony, written for the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1981 to celebrate 300 years of the Austro-German symphonic tradition. Once again, sound heaves itself out of a silence, gradually coalescing into a Brucknerian, architectonic structure. Yet, despite the grandeur, nihilism pervades as the allusions and reminiscences proliferate and shift. Mozartian piano swirls are suddenly fractured by the eruption of violent sonic hell. Symphonic tradition itself seems imperilled in Schnittke's music, which fascinates and unnerves through its very lack of centredness and certainty. The mordant bleakness of his vision was again emphasised in a lunchtime concert in the chill of St Giles's Church, Cripplegate, when Gidon Kremer, Schnittke's friend and advocate, led a series of works for string ensemble. Ula Ulijana on the viola and Marta Sudraba on the cello joined him for the String Trio. Commissioned to commemorate the centenary of Berg's birth, it subjects a fragment of melody that is almost Happy Birthday To You to bleak chromatic contortions, as if warning an infant of the perils of existence. The same soloists played the Concerto for Three, which allows each player a moment of brief, magisterial assertion before everything is swept away in violence. Yet there are moments of redemption in Schnittke that overturn the sombreness of it all. At a late afternoon concert, with the BBC Philharmonic and Vassily Sinaisky, we were allowed to hear what is probably Schnittke's greatest score, his Second Cello Concerto, with the phenomenal Torlief Thedeen as soloist. The work culminates in an overwhelming passacaglia that echoes the finales of both Brahms's Fourth Symphony and Berg's Violin Concerto. Despite some interruptions of coruscating terror, it progresses with ritual solemnity towards a genuine, numinous transcendence. Just for once, you feel that the terrible void has finally been filled.",
