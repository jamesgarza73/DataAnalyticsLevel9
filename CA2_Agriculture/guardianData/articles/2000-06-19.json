      "body": "<p>Even in his relatively public role as artistic director of Meltdown, Scott Walker remains conspicuous by his absence. However, he made his presence felt over the festival's opening weekend with Thimble Rigging, a new score composed by Walker for the Richard Alston Dance Company, with choreography by Martin Lawrance.</p> <p>A prefatory caption informed us that medieval sufferers from psoriasis were known as \"the silver people\", leaving onlookers free to puzzle over how that related to the piece at hand. It seemed that we had been transported to a world of militaristic oppression, since guards were mounted beside the stage while dancers in army-like uniforms marched in front of us. Walker's music alternated between a plaintive minor-key theme assembled from voice samples and drones, and slabs of crushing machine-like noise, driven by a ferocious electronic drumbeat. For what one took to be the silver people, dressed in wispy knitwear that had seen better days, Walker had concocted layers of slow and eerie electronica. There were more questions than answers, but at least you felt they were worth asking.</p> <p>Then we had to wait outside for an hour while the stage was rebuilt so that all-female dance septet the Cholmondeleys could perform a new score by digital mood-meisters, Orbital. When they let us back in, the hall was swimming in dry ice, while the stage was covered with rows of computer-controlled lighting pods which divided the performing area into a giant grid.</p> <p>Orbital's score was crisp and pacy, its precise cross-rhythms mirrored in both the Chums's urgent motion and the geometrical patterning of the stage. With the lighting mainly restricted to broody blues and purples, it was difficult to focus on individual dancers, who had rendered themselves extra anonymous by wearing similar hand-painted body suits. But the music grew increasingly tuneful and optimistic as the piece progressed. What you remembered about the piece wasn't the dancing or Lea Anderson's choreography, but the music and the technical expertise behind the production. Fine by me, though dance aficionados may feel differently.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Even in his relatively public role as artistic director of Meltdown, Scott Walker remains conspicuous by his absence. However, he made his presence felt over the festival's opening weekend with Thimble Rigging, a new score composed by Walker for the Richard Alston Dance Company, with choreography by Martin Lawrance. A prefatory caption informed us that medieval sufferers from psoriasis were known as \"the silver people\", leaving onlookers free to puzzle over how that related to the piece at hand. It seemed that we had been transported to a world of militaristic oppression, since guards were mounted beside the stage while dancers in army-like uniforms marched in front of us. Walker's music alternated between a plaintive minor-key theme assembled from voice samples and drones, and slabs of crushing machine-like noise, driven by a ferocious electronic drumbeat. For what one took to be the silver people, dressed in wispy knitwear that had seen better days, Walker had concocted layers of slow and eerie electronica. There were more questions than answers, but at least you felt they were worth asking. Then we had to wait outside for an hour while the stage was rebuilt so that all-female dance septet the Cholmondeleys could perform a new score by digital mood-meisters, Orbital. When they let us back in, the hall was swimming in dry ice, while the stage was covered with rows of computer-controlled lighting pods which divided the performing area into a giant grid. Orbital's score was crisp and pacy, its precise cross-rhythms mirrored in both the Chums's urgent motion and the geometrical patterning of the stage. With the lighting mainly restricted to broody blues and purples, it was difficult to focus on individual dancers, who had rendered themselves extra anonymous by wearing similar hand-painted body suits. But the music grew increasingly tuneful and optimistic as the piece progressed. What you remembered about the piece wasn't the dancing or Lea Anderson's choreography, but the music and the technical expertise behind the production. Fine by me, though dance aficionados may feel differently.",

He was one of a stream of management departures from ONdigital last autumn.</p> <p>Mr Egan has subpoenaed the former ONdigital chief executive, Stephen Grabiner, to appear at the industrial tri bunal and has requested subpoenas for Carlton Communications' chief executive, Michael Green, and its executive director and chairman, Nigel Walmsley. The hearing has been set for 10.00am next Monday in east Croydon.</p> <p>Mr Egan said: \"Whether or not the launch of ONdigital was a success is the crux of this issue.

Mr Egan's departure was the third senior loss at ONdigital within two months. Mr Grabiner quit to join venture capital firm Apax Partners, while commercial director Jim Ratcliffe also left last summer.</p> <p>The departures were compounded by the resignation of Ashley Faull, ONdigital's head of programming.</p> <p>Both ONdigital and Carlton declined to comment on the proceedings.</p> <p>Analysts have warmed to the current chief executive, Stuart Prebble ,and the company is likely to be floated on the stockmarket within the next year. Valuations of between \u00a31.5bn and \u00a32bn have been put on the business.</p> <p>Carlton recently appointed investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to advise on the future strategy of the business. The pay-TV company has successfully exploited the rights to the Uefa Champions League and recently competed in the auction for the Premiership rights where it was outgunned by larger rivals BSkyB and NTL. By way of a consolation prize it picked up the Nationwide Football League, which it plans to screen on a new premium sports channel.</p> <p>It has recently launched a pay-per-view movie service and email via the television.</p> <p>Mr Egan has since set up his own business, Sit-up.com, which aims to launch an interactive pay-TV auction channel on satellite later this year.</p>",

The company is expected to pass the 1m mark by the end of this year. \"ONdigi tal was a world first and it launched on time and in budget. Of course some shops ran out of set-top boxes but that is because the launch was a success,\" Mr Egan said. He has also made a request for access to management accounts for last year showing the take up of subscriptions and revenues earned. Mr Egan is the second of ONdigital's launch directors to threaten legal action, following a claim for compensation from Mr Grabiner which was settled out of court. Mr Egan's departure was the third senior loss at ONdigital within two months. Mr Grabiner quit to join venture capital firm Apax Partners, while commercial director Jim Ratcliffe also left last summer. The departures were compounded by the resignation of Ashley Faull, ONdigital's head of programming. Both ONdigital and Carlton declined to comment on the proceedings. Analysts have warmed to the current chief executive, Stuart Prebble ,and the company is likely to be floated on the stockmarket within the next year. Valuations of between \u00a31.5bn and \u00a32bn have been put on the business. Carlton recently appointed investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to advise on the future strategy of the business. The pay-TV company has successfully exploited the rights to the Uefa Champions League and recently competed in the auction for the Premiership rights where it was outgunned by larger rivals BSkyB and NTL. By way of a consolation prize it picked up the Nationwide Football League, which it plans to screen on a new premium sports channel. It has recently launched a pay-per-view movie service and email via the television. Mr Egan has since set up his own business, Sit-up.com, which aims to launch an interactive pay-TV auction channel on satellite later this year.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Michael Atherton </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 32. Tests 98. Runs this match: 20,19 </p> <p> It is not so long ago that all the talk was of phasing Michael Atherton out of the England side. The exhausting combination of injury (pain in the back) and the England captaincy (pain in the neck) seemed to have knocked the edge from his game. Not only county cricket no longer seemed worth getting out of bed for. That impression was entirely banished with a hundred against South Africa in Port Elizabeth last winter, and another against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge. Atherton resisted with courage and skill at Edgbaston, and he seemed to possess a game plan designed to respond to an uneven pitch, which was more than could be said for some of his team-mates, but his test average has now slipped noticeably below 40 and may never achieve such heights again. He will have to grind on, all the same. Survival rating: Certain. </p> <p><strong> Mark Ramprakash </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 30. Tests 41. Runs this match: 18, 0 </p> <p> For England to try to convert Mark Ramprakash into an opening batsman at the age of 30, when most people are past changing, is an ambitious project which, at best, has a 50-50 chance of success. The move was forced by a series of factors: the unimpressive form of Mark Butcher at test level, the failure of Darren Maddy to develop, the wish to nurture Michael Vaughan in the middle order and the perception that Nick Knight's technique is too chancy for a place at the top of the order. Ramprakash's technique and intensity both suggested that opening was an option worth trying. But Courtney Walsh twice dismissed him in Birmingham with moderate deliveries to make one yearn for less style and more substance. Whether opening or at number six, a fine talent remains forever imprisoned. Survival rating: Reasonable. </p> <p><strong> Nasser Hussain </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 32. Tests 50. Runs this match: 15, 8 </p> <p> Only Darren Gough received a warmer welcome at Edgbaston than Nasser Hussain, which is a mark of how much Hussain has risen in English affections since he took on the captaincy. It is a task he has approached with commitment, intelligence and shrewdness. Hussain's impatience with the short-termism and emotional extremes of the media is understandable, but England's dressing room sulk on Friday night, when they shunned all requests for interviews, is a worrying indication of a siege mentality that he should have the sense to nip in the bud. What Hussain needs above all is an end to a dreadful run of batting form with some runs for Essex before Lord's. A nonsensical county programme is not about to help; with the days at their longest, the season is now given over to a series of floodlit one-day matches. Survival rating: Certain. </p> <p><strong> Graeme Hick </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 34. Tests 57. Runs this match: 0, 0 </p> <p> Before West Indies intervened, Graeme Hick had never had a pair in his entire career. Frankly, who cares? The Hick comeback has become one of the most predictable happenings of an English test summer. However much his fellow professionals are awed by his power, however much Duncan Fletcher believes that he will be the coach who finally unlocks Hick's talent, the fact is that the nation is deeply cynical about his chances of success. It is conceivable that Hick did not touch the ball from which he was adjudged caught at the wicket in England's second innings, and such extenuating circumstances will doubtless be presented in his favour. Hick should be the most vulnerable to a challenge from Yorkshire's fit-again Michael Vaughan, who could and should have played at Edgbaston. Survival rating: Reasonable. </p> <p><strong> Alec Stewart </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 37. Tests 98. Runs this match: 6, 8 </p> <p> Those looking for an England scapegoat are unlikely to settle for long upon the figure of Alec Stewart. Such is the vim of England's elder statesman that the prospect is not of a test axing but of a glorious return to the one-day side for next month's triangular series. The dropping of Stewart for the one-day series against South Africa in favour of Nottinghamshire's Chris Read is now spoken of as a dreadful mistake. Stewart's fitness, form and dedication makes his age immaterial, and suggests that he should start marketing health drinks as soon as possible. A technique developed on the true, bouncy pitches of the Oval always made him particularly vulnerable to the crabby, uneven bounce at Edgbaston. Give him some decent surfaces and he can still provide England with some of their most memorable moments this summer. Survival rating: Certain. </p> <p><strong> Nick Knight </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 30. Tests 15. Runs this match: 26, 34 </p> <p> Nick Knight presents a problem; a big problem. He was chosen against Zimbabwe as the short-term replacement for the injured Michael Vaughan, kept on for his home ground of Edgbaston even though Vaughan was fit, and sod's law duly intervened as he top-scored in both England innings - albeit only with 26 and 34. That Knight batted pluckily against the West Indies quicks in the second innings cannot be denied. But England's selectors now face a classic dilemma of their own making: do they keep faith with a batsman of exemplary attitude, even though they have limited faith in his ability to cut it at test level? Or do they revert to Vaughan, thank Knight profusely for his sterling efforts and sweet-talk him about being a key element in the one-day side? It is their problem; let them sort it out. Survival rating: Reasonable. </p> <p><strong> Andrew Flintoff </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 22. Tests 9. Runs this match: 16, 12. Wickets: 1-48 </p> <p> Andrew Flintoff had his best test of the summer at Edgbaston. Andrew Flintoff had his best test of the summer at Edgbaston. It needs saying twice because Lancashire's man-mountain has attracted increasing criticism in the three tests to date. But he is the only batsman under the age of 30 - whatever happened to the media-fuelled push for youth at the end of last summer? Flintoff is a potentially devastating batsman who needs to play adventurously, but at Edgbaston twice had a platform slightly less stable than the Millennium Bridge. He will launch Courtney into the stands before the summer is out. His clumping fast-medium bowling was also a bonus; in hindsight, it was about as good as things got. Survival rating: Good. </p> <p><strong> Robert Croft </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 30. Tests 16. Runs: 18, 1. Wickets: 2-53. </p> <p> Those who contend that England's sporting failures can be laid largely at the door of a destructive media should carefully consider the story of Robert Croft. The Welshman's recall last week might have brought cries of \"Is that what we have come to?\" but instead it was greeted with optimistic noises about a new Crofty, awash with adventure, mystery and variety. It was the most riskily upbeat message since Ian Austin was presented as a po tential World Cup star a year ago. In the final analysis, Croft did well enough. He did bowl with more ambition and guile than of old, held England's attack together at times, and the West Indies' plethora of left-handers makes it entirely logical that he retains his place ahead of Lancashire's tyro leg-spinner, Chris Schofield. Survival rating: Good. </p> <p><strong> Andrew Caddick </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 31. Tests 33. Runs: 21*, 4. Wickets: 2-94. </p> <p> Andrew Caddick is another England player whose survival for Lord's will be automatic. He did, after all, return from last winter's tour of South Africa with his reputation enhanced, not least for a seven-wicket haul in Durban which gave England considerable hopes - eventually unrealised - of victory. At Edgbaston, though, Caddick was a disappointment. He is something of a perfectionist, who would like all his test wickets to be dismissed in classical fashion - lift and bounce from a perfect length, causing the batsman to be bowled or caught behind - and he still seems at a loss how to respond when life is not quite so simple. Disputes rage whether Caddick or the Edgbaston pitch went to sleep when the West Indian batsmen grabbed the initiative on the second day, but he is the best practitioner of his art that England possess. Survival rating: Certain. </p> <p><strong> Darren Gough </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 29. Tests 39. Runs: 23, 23*. Wickets: 5-109. </p> <p> What Darren Gough most urgently needs is a pair of blinkers, so that he can no longer see the Freeserve Speedster. Gough has developed a dangerous obsession with the Speedster, which records the pace of every delivery bowled, and in the England dressing room he sometimes talks of little else. Things conceivably could be worse - imagine if he had fallen for the stump-cam instead and gazed longingly into it after every delivery. Blinkers or not, Gough has begun the summer with wonderful ebullience. He was England's best player at Edgbaston, including Brian Lara in a haul of five wickets, bearing a heavy workload uncomplainingly and even batting with a gusto that has not been seen for years. The system of central contracts has been good for him, however much Yorkshire might disagree. Survival rating: Certain. </p> <p><strong> Ed Giddins </strong><br> </p> <p> Age 28. Tests 4. Runs: 0, 0. Wickets: 0-73. </p> <p> Ed Giddins also made a pair at Lord's, although it was certainly not his first and, unlike that of Graeme Hick here, passed with barely a comment. It is Giddins' fast-medium bowling that will particularly concern the selectors. He bowled well at Lord's when the ball swung, and moderately at Edgbaston, his home ground, when it did not. He does not hit the pitch hard enough, quick enough, or from a great enough height, to be hugely assisted by surfaces of uneven bounce. There are sound arguments for retaining Giddins: he bowled well at Lord's against Zimbabwe only a few weeks ago; Steve Harmison, a potential debutant, is now injured; and Ed is a confident soul who is capable of surviving a setback or two. In fact, if they play the loyalty card determinedly enough, England's selectors could just about name an unchanged team. Survival rating: Reasonable.</p>",

      "body": "<p>David Seaman </p> <p> The odd Seaman moment, notably one flap at a corner and a late walkabout near the byline, but otherwise one of his sounder recent displays. 7/10 </p> <p> Gary Neville </p> <p> His long throws remain important but his passes out of defence were often wayward. Often defends as if he lacks confidence. 5 </p> <p> Martin Keown </p> <p> Immense. Made tackle after crucial tackle, header after crucial header, his concentration level and drive never wavering, and offered vocal encouragement to others. 9 </p> <p> Sol Campbell </p> <p> Gave away some dangerous free-kicks early on but settled down to produce one of his better recent performances. 8 </p> <p> Phil Neville </p> <p> Solid and unfussy, he increasingly looks more at home at left-back. It was his centre - albeit with his right foot - which set up Michael Owen for the header Oliver Kahn tipped against the post. 7 </p> <p> David Beckham </p> <p> Largely peripheral, but remains uncannily involved when England score and, of course, it was from his free-kick that the winner came. 7 </p> <p> Paul Ince </p> <p> Ran and ran and ran, made crucial tackles and was inevitably on hand when England needed him. Was left for pace a couple of times but a mainstay of this team. 8 </p> <p> Paul Scholes </p> <p> Another vital contribution, one minute tackling back in defence, then creating a chance, then firing at goal himself. Proved his versatility when he was moved forward as a second striker late in the game. 8 </p> <p> Dennis Wise </p> <p> Struggled early on, getting beaten for pace and often caught in possession.

      "bodyText": "David Seaman The odd Seaman moment, notably one flap at a corner and a late walkabout near the byline, but otherwise one of his sounder recent displays. 7/10 Gary Neville His long throws remain important but his passes out of defence were often wayward. Often defends as if he lacks confidence. 5 Martin Keown Immense. Made tackle after crucial tackle, header after crucial header, his concentration level and drive never wavering, and offered vocal encouragement to others. 9 Sol Campbell Gave away some dangerous free-kicks early on but settled down to produce one of his better recent performances. 8 Phil Neville Solid and unfussy, he increasingly looks more at home at left-back. It was his centre - albeit with his right foot - which set up Michael Owen for the header Oliver Kahn tipped against the post. 7 David Beckham Largely peripheral, but remains uncannily involved when England score and, of course, it was from his free-kick that the winner came. 7 Paul Ince Ran and ran and ran, made crucial tackles and was inevitably on hand when England needed him. Was left for pace a couple of times but a mainstay of this team. 8 Paul Scholes Another vital contribution, one minute tackling back in defence, then creating a chance, then firing at goal himself. Proved his versatility when he was moved forward as a second striker late in the game. 8 Dennis Wise Struggled early on, getting beaten for pace and often caught in possession. He slowly got to grips with his unaccustomed role on the left, but it wasn't one of his best games. 6 Alan Shearer Still knows how to hold the ball up and drag defenders out of position. He took the goal with the clinical efficiency of a great striker, even if he is no longer that. 7 Michael Owen England's style of play is not geared to using his pace, but nearly scored with one off-balance header.

Now, I said (and this predictably was the entire six seconds they used out of a five-minute interview) we would just have to sit gently humming the tune - di da di di di di di - to ourselves at home. \"Or should that be in a home?\" the presenter was kind enough to back- announce. </p> <p>And so to match night and ITV, the station of choice for those to whom Motty is just an old guy in a sheepskin coat.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It has clearly been a sore point with Martin Keown. As he left the pitch after Saturday's historic victory, Kevin Keegan embraced him with a shout of \"Well done\". But the big defender's first words on this memorable night were not \"Thanks, boss\" or \"What a win\". Instead they were, \"I should have played against them in Euro 96\". </p> <p>Keown was left out of Terry Venables's squad four years ago and, as Keegan discovered, \"against Germany, Martin was a man on a mission\". </p> <p>It showed. In Saturday's match the Arsenal player embarked on a remarkable 90-minute wide-eyed vigil, where danger was the prey and whenever it appeared he was on hand, quick to pounce and ruthless, refusing to let the old foe past; blocking here, heading there while all the time still finding room to urge on his team-mates, cajoling them into position, constantly reminding them of just what this game meant. </p> <p>England needed a win, not just for history's sake but to stay in the tournament. But for Keown it was personal. </p> <p>Although he appeared in all England's games in Euro 92 he had not played in a major finals since then. England did not qualify for the 1994 World Cup and he was overlooked in 1996. At the last World Cup he was a substitute for every game but never played. </p> <p>So Saturday's match gave Keown, a friendly, intelligent and hugely patriotic man, his first chance to do something about beating Germany after years of looking on helpless from the sidelines. </p> <p>\"Like loads of people I had sat and watched in frustration at losing the penalty shoot-outs to the Germans in the past,\" he said. \"I felt that in 1996 I shouldn't have been at home watching that and kicking my heels. I felt that I should have been involved in some way. </p> <p>\"When Gareth Southgate missed, like a lot of people I didn't know what to do.

      "bodyText": "It has clearly been a sore point with Martin Keown. As he left the pitch after Saturday's historic victory, Kevin Keegan embraced him with a shout of \"Well done\". But the big defender's first words on this memorable night were not \"Thanks, boss\" or \"What a win\". Instead they were, \"I should have played against them in Euro 96\". Keown was left out of Terry Venables's squad four years ago and, as Keegan discovered, \"against Germany, Martin was a man on a mission\". It showed. In Saturday's match the Arsenal player embarked on a remarkable 90-minute wide-eyed vigil, where danger was the prey and whenever it appeared he was on hand, quick to pounce and ruthless, refusing to let the old foe past; blocking here, heading there while all the time still finding room to urge on his team-mates, cajoling them into position, constantly reminding them of just what this game meant. England needed a win, not just for history's sake but to stay in the tournament. But for Keown it was personal. Although he appeared in all England's games in Euro 92 he had not played in a major finals since then. England did not qualify for the 1994 World Cup and he was overlooked in 1996. At the last World Cup he was a substitute for every game but never played. So Saturday's match gave Keown, a friendly, intelligent and hugely patriotic man, his first chance to do something about beating Germany after years of looking on helpless from the sidelines. \"Like loads of people I had sat and watched in frustration at losing the penalty shoot-outs to the Germans in the past,\" he said. \"I felt that in 1996 I shouldn't have been at home watching that and kicking my heels. I felt that I should have been involved in some way. \"When Gareth Southgate missed, like a lot of people I didn't know what to do. I just felt so strongly that England were going to win that competition. I thought it was our year. \"But to finally get the opportunity in a major competition to play Germany - something I've thought was going to pass me by - was fantastic and to beat them was special. \"As for my performance, well, they kept putting more of the same [sort of] players on and putting the ball into the penalty box and you had to stand up and be counted. I thought Sol did exceptionally well, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\" And yet Keown might not have started at all had his Arsenal team-mate Tony Adams been fit, compounding the sense of deja vu he felt when Adams was given the nod ahead of him for England's first game against Portugal. \"When I was left out of that match I was thinking 'Here we go again'. But the manager told me that I would have a big part to play in the competition. And on Saturday it was nice for my family to see me on the pitch finally because, for the last two tournaments, they thought I was working for the media.\" His family may now see him in the England starting line-up more often, especially after he formed such a watertight defensive partnership with Sol Campbell against Germany. But yesterday Keegan was thinking the unthinkable. \"Martin Keown has had a lot of good games for me and that was probably the best because it was the biggest match,\" he said. \"But it wouldn't be hard to bring Tony Adams back in. \"Everyone knows what I think of him, his leadership qualities and the way he has performed for England over the years. He would add something to us.\" Keegan believes that Adams will be fit for the quarter-final, if England make it. But it would be an awful blow for Keown if he had to make way. Adams does possess leadership qualities, but on Saturday Keown's own personified the hard-working Team England mentality which dug out the victory. There will be those who frown upon England turning into Leicester City in order to get a result.

      "body": "<p>Major football tournaments tend to yield enduring cameo moments which either place into perspective what has been or set the tone for what is to come. </p> <p>After explaining, briefly and precisely, why his team had fallen so heavily at a grim afternoon's final fence, Romania's coach Emerich Ienei was asked his opinion on his team's final group fixture against England in Charleroi tomorrow night. </p> <p>Ienei, moving purposefully towards the sanctuary of an air-conditioned bus, delivered not words but the sort of withering glance that Sir Alex Ferguson unleashes whenever his tactical approach is questioned. </p> <p>Last-minute defeats are always hard to stomach but Ienei, the colour having long departed his face, had the demeanour of one who knew the game was up. </p> <p>Portugal, through Costinha's late goal, have qualified for the last eight. Romania could still squeeze into the quarter-finals by returning England to reality but their football was so astoundingly bankrupt of ideas and improvisation in the Gelredome that that seems unlikely. </p> <p>In short, England are looking at a dream of a final game, against a side who have lost their belief and their most significant player, Gheorghe Hagi, who will be suspended after collecting his second caution of the competition. </p> <p>\"What now? Well, we can still get through if we can overcome the English; that might still prove to be enough for us,\" said Ienei. \"Unfortunately we lost this game in the last second; or perhaps after the last second, because although the referee signalled for four minutes of injury-time the goal came in the 96th minute.\" </p> <p>If Romania were poor, Portugal were no better. Yet Humberto Coelho's team has many players of enviable ability.

      "bodyText": "Major football tournaments tend to yield enduring cameo moments which either place into perspective what has been or set the tone for what is to come. After explaining, briefly and precisely, why his team had fallen so heavily at a grim afternoon's final fence, Romania's coach Emerich Ienei was asked his opinion on his team's final group fixture against England in Charleroi tomorrow night. Ienei, moving purposefully towards the sanctuary of an air-conditioned bus, delivered not words but the sort of withering glance that Sir Alex Ferguson unleashes whenever his tactical approach is questioned. Last-minute defeats are always hard to stomach but Ienei, the colour having long departed his face, had the demeanour of one who knew the game was up. Portugal, through Costinha's late goal, have qualified for the last eight. Romania could still squeeze into the quarter-finals by returning England to reality but their football was so astoundingly bankrupt of ideas and improvisation in the Gelredome that that seems unlikely. In short, England are looking at a dream of a final game, against a side who have lost their belief and their most significant player, Gheorghe Hagi, who will be suspended after collecting his second caution of the competition. \"What now? Well, we can still get through if we can overcome the English; that might still prove to be enough for us,\" said Ienei. \"Unfortunately we lost this game in the last second; or perhaps after the last second, because although the referee signalled for four minutes of injury-time the goal came in the 96th minute.\" If Romania were poor, Portugal were no better. Yet Humberto Coelho's team has many players of enviable ability. It did not seem that way on Saturday but, after beating England with such elegance last Monday, they were more concerned with not losing, rather than winning, their second game. The match was unspeakably dull. Portugal's main failing was the limpness of their crossing. With Everton's Abel Xavier omitted despite his impressive contribution against England, they could not even cross for toffee. Luis Figo did everything to ridicule the notion that he is the most accomplished player on the planet, Joao Pinto fell over with Heskeyesque regularity, and Nuno Gomes shredded his reputation for intelligent forward play; it was wretched stuff. But the weakest link in the Portuguese chain is at the back, in black. Vitor Baia cannot kick, flaps at anything above shin level and instils in those around him knee-trembling panic. As the tournament progresses he may well prove a liability whom Portugal cannot adequately protect. The game did not deserve a winner but it got one, the substitute Costinha rising magnificently seconds from the end to head home Figo's free-kick. \"We didn't play as we can play. The important thing is that we are definitely into the next phase,\" said Coelho. \"We came here to win games and we have now played twice and won twice. That sounds reasonably good to me.\"",

But a goal from Savo Milosevic, which makes him the top scorer with three at Euro 2000, breathed welcome life into Group C, in which any two of the four teams can still go through. With the top two finishing positions in the other three groups looking so assured, the organisers will be relieved that the final group games will not contain as many non-events as had been assumed. Sadly, it was also a match marred by diving, time-wasting and the feigning of injury which led the Scottish referee Hugh Dallas to send off the Yugoslav substitute Mateja Kezman for a bad tackle on Erik Mykland in the 88th minute, just 60 seconds after coming on. Yugoslavia, thrown out of the 1992 tournament during the Balkan crisis, have never been a team to stir the emotions of those outside their borders. But against a Norway side whose style is so direct that it makes Wimbledon look like Real Madrid, they had a remarkable fan base among the neutrals. So their opening goal after eight minutes was received with wild acclaim from anyone not dressed in Norwegian red. And what an irony it was that against a side which could easily masquerade as a Premiership XI it should have been scored by Savo Milosevic, who was Stan Collymore's predecessor as a troublesome Aston Villa centre-forward. Quick off the mark he deflected a free-kick from Ljubinko Drulovic into the far corner of the net to leave Norway's players asking themselves how they had failed to clear the danger with virtually the whole of their team inside the box. Milosevic also got his head to a Drulovic cross, whipped in with the pace and accuracy of David Beckham, and created a chance for Predrag Mijatovic that Thomas Myhre did well to touch over. As Yugoslavia's neat football continued to produce chances, Norway's coach Nils Johan Semb was no doubt yelling that well-known phrase from the Graham Taylor hymn book: \"Can we not knock it?\" When they did, Tore Andre Flo overclubbed a chip from inside of the box which never looked like forcing a save. The Yugoslavs, who dug themselves out of an enormous hole in the opening game after trailing 3-0 to Slovenia, had clearly decided to get their retaliation, and their goals, in first this time. They were also encouraged by Spain's win over Slovenia which puts progress from Group C up for grabs. Milosevic did not go cold in the half-time interval, quickly causing more panic in the Norway defence by taking a neat pass from Mijatovic and setting up Vladimir Jugovic in a position from which he might have done better than give Myhre some easy practice. The Norwegians, perhaps stung by criticism of their style, failed to fire in their usual prodigious crosses, though when Eric Mykland did send one in from the left, it almost brought a goal.

      "body": "<p>It is an unforeseen though welcome consequence of Gordon Brown's \u00a31bn budget bonanza for schools that the children of Yoxford primary are about to get a new box of skipping ropes.</p> <p>In common with every state school in the country, a share of the chancellor's billion, announced in March, is just about now finding its way to Yoxford primary, a school in a village of the same name in north Suffolk. The biggest primaries got \u00a39,000. Yoxford, like other small primaries got the smallest slice, \u00a33,000, but, assuming the school governors rubber stamp the head teacher Peter Scuffil's proposals, this will be enough to provide \u00a31,000 worth of reading books, \u00a31,000 in maths equipment, including several sets of good-quality weighing scales, \u00a3500 for CD-Roms and \u00a3500 for games equipment including skipping ropes, stilts and balls for the playground.</p> <p>What was unusual about the \"Brown money\" was that it came with no strings. No bidding, no applications, no competition, no matching funds from the council: heads could spend it on whatever they wanted. The government's approach until then had been to give schools money for essentials, and extra money for its - the government's - priorities, determining when it was spent and what it was spent on. Head teachers welcomed the Brown money, and particularly its method of delivery. But even now, they say, a combination of historic underfunding, new stresses and some bad luck means that often this money is no luxury.</p> <p>\"In many parts of the country it's being used to prop up school budgets where they have been inadequately funded,\" said John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"They are certainly not spending it on treats. I'd say they are spending it on essentials.\"</p> <p>Though the Tory-introduced local management of schools (LMS) put responsibility for budgets in the hands of head teachers, the national curriculum, national pay awards and a welter of government initiatives limit their freedom to manoeuvre. The standards fund - the government's main channel for targeting funds to national priorities, which is filtered through local education authorities and for which some elements require matching council funds - is alone worth \u00a31.7bn this year.</p> <p>But head teachers detect that the argument is swinging their way. David Blunkett has floated proposals to give money from central government directly to head teachers, with a separate pot for the LEAs to fulfil LEA functions.</p> <p>A green paper on local government funding this summer is likely to go some way towards a national funding formula. The comprehensive spending review should unleash at least between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn in extra education spending.</p> <p>In his staff room in Yoxford, Mr Scuffil explained: \"There is not a lot of the budget you actually have control over.\" Of the \u00a3157,083 due to be spent by Yoxford this year, \u00a3141,462 comes under the funding formula through Suffolk county council. Then comes \u00a312,889 from the standards fund: for the literacy and numeracy strategy (\u00a31,098), for \"school improvements\" - where there is some leeway - \u00a33,421, for teaching assistants (\u00a31,645), for changes to the national curriculum (\u00a3315), special educational needs (\u00a3250) and a very welcome \u00a36,060 for small schools' administrative support. And with it, paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.</p> <p>\"Initiatives are all very well but there are so many that you can't focus on one properly because there are another four that we are thinking about at the same time. Look back to the days when schools had autonomy over the curriculum, even though we all sort of did the same thing. I don't suppose I would do anything wildly different but somehow the freedom to pursue good ideas is gone.\" In Mr Blunkett's defence, he has promised a cut in paperwork. And Mr Scuffil concedes: \"For some teachers the freedom to pursue bad ideas has gone, which must be good too.\"</p> <p><b> Budget balancing</b><br></p> <p>Mr Scuffil has been head for 22 years of Yoxford primary's 102 year history. Backed by supportive governors and the local education authority, he gets within 2% of his spending target each year. His governors' main aim is to maintain the number of teaching staff and to insure against a fall in pupil numbers. Yoxford tends to bump along with a pupil roll in the mid-50s, although it is up to 62. With much of its income determined on a per-pupil basis (\u00a31,454.57 for every five-year-old, \u00a31,455.91 for every eight-year-old), tiny changes make a big difference and can threaten staff numbers. Helped by printouts from the health authority, the school predicts intake each year. Seventeen are leaving in September; only five are coming in, and another three expected in January, the month the school's role is calculated for the budget. Which is why the governors are keeping \u00a39,000 in reserve in the school's fund.</p> <p>Bolstered by a glowing Ofsted report, the school is determined to hold on to its teachers. It has only \"3.2\" - that is, Mr Scuffil, two other full-timers and someone who comes in on a Wednesday, the day Mr Scuffil sets aside for head teacher-related business</p> <p>For its 3.2, Yoxford pays out \u00a396,000 a year. \"Everyone remembers a good teacher - except the person who pays them,\" rued Mr Scuffil. After other staff costs - including classroom assistants, caretaking, midday supervision - Yoxford has already spent \u00a3123,450. Of the re mainder, \u00a316,460 goes on upkeep of the building, much of which is contracted to Suffolk and does not pass in or out of the school's budget.</p> <p>And then there are a few items where the head does have choices, but it hardly seems indulgence: the school fete and other fundraising through the year ensures that school trips, including one to London every year, are free; County advisory teachers to come in and take the occasional lesson, to give the Yoxford teachers new ideas and input (\u00a31,645). The school pays the county \u00a31,215 to lend it 250 library books, which get changed each term, and \u00a3700 to the county paymaster to sort out staff salaries and tax.</p> <p>Lawnswood school in Leeds got \u00a350,000 in Brown money, the maximum. But then it has 1,496 pupils and its budget is in a different league. It will be spending \u00a34,227,400 this year.</p> <p>The head teacher Lindsey Wharmby's total staffing bill is \u00a33,119,600. The school will pay energy bills of around \u00a361,800 and \u00a363,000 to the exam boards, both sums more than it will spend on replacing books and equipment. A very cold winter, and the energy bill could be more. And Lawnswood is trying to claw back a deficit which at \u00a3120,000 is nearly the size of Yoxford's entire budget.</p> <p>That deficit is the reason Ms Wharmby's pupils will not be skipping with Gordon Brown's ropes. The money will be the contingency for the general running of the school; if it isn't spent, it will go towards the deficit. \"What it did was just give us a little bit of ease all the way through the budget,\" said Mrs Wharmby.</p> <p><b> Into the red</b><br></p> <p>Schools aren't supposed to go into the red. But many do. In a straw poll by John Dunford, about a quarter of his head teachers are spending the Brown money on their school deficit, including heads in Leicester, Manchester and Northumberland. (The remaining 75% were divided roughly equally between materials - textbooks and computers, and staffing.)</p> <p>Mrs Wharmby expected an \u00a380,000 shortfall last year to cope with a drop in pupil numbers, caused by a very small year 11. With larger year groups (and therefore more money) due in later years she calculated the deficit, covered by the LEA and no more than 2% of the school's budget, could be paid in three years. However, a flu epidemic which hit 16 staff between December and January was compounded by four staff going on long-term sick leave.</p> <p>It could have been worse. Mrs Wharmby decided at the last minute to continue taking out insurance against sick leave. Even so, the insurance covers only \u00a3100 of the \u00a3140-150-a-day it costs to bring in a supply teacher; the rest is picked up by the school. She hadn't budgeted enough. \"I looked at the pattern over the last two years and put in the same again, and I was wrong.\"</p> <p>This year Mrs Wharmby has budgeted cautiously, including \u00a364,000 for insurance and supply teaching costs, to get the deficit back to just under 2%. Some class sizes will have to rise, and teacher numbers fall. Year groups of roughly 270 pupils will be split across nine teachers rather than 10 for some subjects. \"You run on a knife-edge all the time.\"</p> <p>On Mrs Wharmby's own admission Lawnswood has had a \"quite generous\" grant this year, with a rise on last year. But again a huge proportion of it is centrally directed, and Mrs Wharmby welcomes it almost in spite of herself.</p> <p>The Brown money is dwarfed by an extra \u00a3362,440 from the standards fund and the excellence in cities programme, mostly provided by central government, some with matching funds from the Leeds. \"Excellence in cities is very exciting. But it's changing the whole nature of LMS, because central government is saying 'this is what we want to do in schools'. It just so happens that at the moment I totally approve of everything they are putting their money into.\"</p> <p>From excellence in cities comes two learning mentors and a coordinator for work with gifted and talented pupils. The school gets \u00a337,500 for social inclusion, \u00a310,130 in assistant teachers, and \u00a313,300 for the new post-16 qualifications.</p> <p>\"Local management of schools was brought in by an anti-LEA administration,\" said Mrs Wharmby. \"The present administration is bypassing LMS to get their agenda into schools.\"</p> <p>Bushey Meads school, near Watford, Hertfordshire, was a winner under the previous government's agenda, because it became a grant maintained school.</p> <p>But in its new guise as a foundation school it still has the feel of a school doing well, in a well-funded county which benefits from an area cost adjustment that favours the counties ringing London. Bushey Meads is overcrowded - 1,070 pupils in a school built for 636. Its sixth form, which is the most lucrative in terms of funding per pupil, is 250-strong.</p> <p>And in a budget of \u00a32,969,082 (not including \u00a3290,512 direct funding for its centre for 28 children with disabilities), about \u00a3120,000 comes from the government grants and the standards fund. It asks parents to contribute \u00a360 a year, not all of whom contribute - some can't, some won't on principle. The school uses \u00a310,000 of that money for the running of the school and the rest for a school \"future fund\" reserved mainly for IT.</p> <p>But, said headteacher Dena Coleman, the school is not wealthy. This year it is reducing staff levels by 0.8. Throughout Bushey Meads, small classrooms compound the overcrowding problem. Most of the school roofs need repairing. Replacing roofs on one block cost \u00a370,000.</p> <p>She believes sixth form class sizes will rise and the teaching time per course fall, because they have not received significant extra money for the new A level syllabus. Dr Coleman estimated she needed another \u00a340,000 to cover it. \"We welcome the broad curriculum but we want the funding to be put in place.\" Lots of the extra staffing from the Brown money identified by John Dunford is going into sixth forms.</p> <p>At Bushey Meads, the \u00a340,000 of Brown money will cover a theoretical deficit of \u00a326,000. The remainder will be contingency and if any is spare, spent on books and equipment for science and IT.</p> <p>\"The Brown money is very important to us. The thing that we appreciate very much is that it has come directly to schools. Its unfortunate that we have to use it largely to wipe out our deficit,\" said Dr Coleman.</p> <p>\"Schools went grant maintained originally because they were under-funded. It certainly didn't go on long enough to put right all the things that were needed here. We are an example of the better off and we have problems, so goodness knows what some of my colleagues have to deal with.\"</p> <p><b>Where the money goes</b></p> <p><b> Yoxford primary school, Suffolk</b></p> <p><b>Type:</b> County, mixed, ages 4-9</p> <p><b> Head teacher:</b> Peter Scuffil</p> <p><b> Number of pupils:</b> 62</p> <p><b> Spending this year:</b> \u00a3157,083</p> <p><b> How much extra money from Gordon Brown in the budget?</b> \u00a33,000</p> <p><b> Spending it on:</b> Maths and games equipment, reading books, CD-Roms</p> <p><b> With twice the extra money, what would you spend it on?</b> Increasing hours of part-time teacher</p> <p><b> Lawnswood comprehensive school, Leeds</b></p> <p><b>Type:</b> County, mixed, ages 11-18</p> <p><b> Head teacher:</b> Lindsey Wharmby</p> <p><b> Number of pupils:</b> 1,496</p> <p><b> Spending this year:</b> \u00a34,227,440</p> <p><b> How much extra money from the budget? </b> \u00a350,000</p> <p><b> Spending it on:</b> Keeping deficit down</p> <p><b> With twice the extra money, what would you spend it on?</b> The same</p> <p><b> Bushey Meads school, Hertfordshire</b></p> <p><b>Type:</b> Foundation, mixed, ages 11-18</p> <p><b> Head teacher:</b> Dena Coleman</p> <p><b> Number of pupils: </b> 1,070</p> <p><b> Spending this year: </b> \u00a32,969,082</p> <p><b> How much extra money from the budget?</b> \u00a340,000</p> <p><b> Spending it on:</b> \u00a326,000 against deficit, \u00a314,000 as contingency funds for year</p> <p><b> With twice the extra money, what would you spend it on? </b> Textbooks, IT equipment, technology and science, especially key stage 3; increasing staffing</p>",

Yoxford, like other small primaries got the smallest slice, \u00a33,000, but, assuming the school governors rubber stamp the head teacher Peter Scuffil's proposals, this will be enough to provide \u00a31,000 worth of reading books, \u00a31,000 in maths equipment, including several sets of good-quality weighing scales, \u00a3500 for CD-Roms and \u00a3500 for games equipment including skipping ropes, stilts and balls for the playground. What was unusual about the \"Brown money\" was that it came with no strings. No bidding, no applications, no competition, no matching funds from the council: heads could spend it on whatever they wanted. The government's approach until then had been to give schools money for essentials, and extra money for its - the government's - priorities, determining when it was spent and what it was spent on. Head teachers welcomed the Brown money, and particularly its method of delivery. But even now, they say, a combination of historic underfunding, new stresses and some bad luck means that often this money is no luxury. \"In many parts of the country it's being used to prop up school budgets where they have been inadequately funded,\" said John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association. David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"They are certainly not spending it on treats. I'd say they are spending it on essentials.\" Though the Tory-introduced local management of schools (LMS) put responsibility for budgets in the hands of head teachers, the national curriculum, national pay awards and a welter of government initiatives limit their freedom to manoeuvre. The standards fund - the government's main channel for targeting funds to national priorities, which is filtered through local education authorities and for which some elements require matching council funds - is alone worth \u00a31.7bn this year. But head teachers detect that the argument is swinging their way. David Blunkett has floated proposals to give money from central government directly to head teachers, with a separate pot for the LEAs to fulfil LEA functions. A green paper on local government funding this summer is likely to go some way towards a national funding formula. The comprehensive spending review should unleash at least between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn in extra education spending. In his staff room in Yoxford, Mr Scuffil explained: \"There is not a lot of the budget you actually have control over.\" Of the \u00a3157,083 due to be spent by Yoxford this year, \u00a3141,462 comes under the funding formula through Suffolk county council. Then comes \u00a312,889 from the standards fund: for the literacy and numeracy strategy (\u00a31,098), for \"school improvements\" - where there is some leeway - \u00a33,421, for teaching assistants (\u00a31,645), for changes to the national curriculum (\u00a3315), special educational needs (\u00a3250) and a very welcome \u00a36,060 for small schools' administrative support. And with it, paperwork, paperwork, paperwork. \"Initiatives are all very well but there are so many that you can't focus on one properly because there are another four that we are thinking about at the same time. Look back to the days when schools had autonomy over the curriculum, even though we all sort of did the same thing. I don't suppose I would do anything wildly different but somehow the freedom to pursue good ideas is gone.\" In Mr Blunkett's defence, he has promised a cut in paperwork. And Mr Scuffil concedes: \"For some teachers the freedom to pursue bad ideas has gone, which must be good too.\" Budget balancing Mr Scuffil has been head for 22 years of Yoxford primary's 102 year history. Backed by supportive governors and the local education authority, he gets within 2% of his spending target each year. His governors' main aim is to maintain the number of teaching staff and to insure against a fall in pupil numbers. Yoxford tends to bump along with a pupil roll in the mid-50s, although it is up to 62. With much of its income determined on a per-pupil basis (\u00a31,454.57 for every five-year-old, \u00a31,455.91 for every eight-year-old), tiny changes make a big difference and can threaten staff numbers. Helped by printouts from the health authority, the school predicts intake each year. Seventeen are leaving in September; only five are coming in, and another three expected in January, the month the school's role is calculated for the budget. Which is why the governors are keeping \u00a39,000 in reserve in the school's fund. Bolstered by a glowing Ofsted report, the school is determined to hold on to its teachers. It has only \"3.2\" - that is, Mr Scuffil, two other full-timers and someone who comes in on a Wednesday, the day Mr Scuffil sets aside for head teacher-related business For its 3.2, Yoxford pays out \u00a396,000 a year. \"Everyone remembers a good teacher - except the person who pays them,\" rued Mr Scuffil. After other staff costs - including classroom assistants, caretaking, midday supervision - Yoxford has already spent \u00a3123,450. Of the re mainder, \u00a316,460 goes on upkeep of the building, much of which is contracted to Suffolk and does not pass in or out of the school's budget. And then there are a few items where the head does have choices, but it hardly seems indulgence: the school fete and other fundraising through the year ensures that school trips, including one to London every year, are free; County advisory teachers to come in and take the occasional lesson, to give the Yoxford teachers new ideas and input (\u00a31,645). The school pays the county \u00a31,215 to lend it 250 library books, which get changed each term, and \u00a3700 to the county paymaster to sort out staff salaries and tax. Lawnswood school in Leeds got \u00a350,000 in Brown money, the maximum. But then it has 1,496 pupils and its budget is in a different league. It will be spending \u00a34,227,400 this year. The head teacher Lindsey Wharmby's total staffing bill is \u00a33,119,600. The school will pay energy bills of around \u00a361,800 and \u00a363,000 to the exam boards, both sums more than it will spend on replacing books and equipment. A very cold winter, and the energy bill could be more. And Lawnswood is trying to claw back a deficit which at \u00a3120,000 is nearly the size of Yoxford's entire budget. That deficit is the reason Ms Wharmby's pupils will not be skipping with Gordon Brown's ropes. The money will be the contingency for the general running of the school; if it isn't spent, it will go towards the deficit. \"What it did was just give us a little bit of ease all the way through the budget,\" said Mrs Wharmby. Into the red Schools aren't supposed to go into the red. But many do. In a straw poll by John Dunford, about a quarter of his head teachers are spending the Brown money on their school deficit, including heads in Leicester, Manchester and Northumberland. (The remaining 75% were divided roughly equally between materials - textbooks and computers, and staffing.) Mrs Wharmby expected an \u00a380,000 shortfall last year to cope with a drop in pupil numbers, caused by a very small year 11. With larger year groups (and therefore more money) due in later years she calculated the deficit, covered by the LEA and no more than 2% of the school's budget, could be paid in three years. However, a flu epidemic which hit 16 staff between December and January was compounded by four staff going on long-term sick leave. It could have been worse. Mrs Wharmby decided at the last minute to continue taking out insurance against sick leave. Even so, the insurance covers only \u00a3100 of the \u00a3140-150-a-day it costs to bring in a supply teacher; the rest is picked up by the school. She hadn't budgeted enough. \"I looked at the pattern over the last two years and put in the same again, and I was wrong.\" This year Mrs Wharmby has budgeted cautiously, including \u00a364,000 for insurance and supply teaching costs, to get the deficit back to just under 2%. Some class sizes will have to rise, and teacher numbers fall. Year groups of roughly 270 pupils will be split across nine teachers rather than 10 for some subjects. \"You run on a knife-edge all the time.\" On Mrs Wharmby's own admission Lawnswood has had a \"quite generous\" grant this year, with a rise on last year. But again a huge proportion of it is centrally directed, and Mrs Wharmby welcomes it almost in spite of herself. The Brown money is dwarfed by an extra \u00a3362,440 from the standards fund and the excellence in cities programme, mostly provided by central government, some with matching funds from the Leeds. \"Excellence in cities is very exciting. But it's changing the whole nature of LMS, because central government is saying 'this is what we want to do in schools'. It just so happens that at the moment I totally approve of everything they are putting their money into.\" From excellence in cities comes two learning mentors and a coordinator for work with gifted and talented pupils. The school gets \u00a337,500 for social inclusion, \u00a310,130 in assistant teachers, and \u00a313,300 for the new post-16 qualifications. \"Local management of schools was brought in by an anti-LEA administration,\" said Mrs Wharmby. \"The present administration is bypassing LMS to get their agenda into schools.\" Bushey Meads school, near Watford, Hertfordshire, was a winner under the previous government's agenda, because it became a grant maintained school. But in its new guise as a foundation school it still has the feel of a school doing well, in a well-funded county which benefits from an area cost adjustment that favours the counties ringing London. Bushey Meads is overcrowded - 1,070 pupils in a school built for 636. Its sixth form, which is the most lucrative in terms of funding per pupil, is 250-strong. And in a budget of \u00a32,969,082 (not including \u00a3290,512 direct funding for its centre for 28 children with disabilities), about \u00a3120,000 comes from the government grants and the standards fund. It asks parents to contribute \u00a360 a year, not all of whom contribute - some can't, some won't on principle. The school uses \u00a310,000 of that money for the running of the school and the rest for a school \"future fund\" reserved mainly for IT. But, said headteacher Dena Coleman, the school is not wealthy. This year it is reducing staff levels by 0.8. Throughout Bushey Meads, small classrooms compound the overcrowding problem. Most of the school roofs need repairing. Replacing roofs on one block cost \u00a370,000. She believes sixth form class sizes will rise and the teaching time per course fall, because they have not received significant extra money for the new A level syllabus. Dr Coleman estimated she needed another \u00a340,000 to cover it. \"We welcome the broad curriculum but we want the funding to be put in place.\" Lots of the extra staffing from the Brown money identified by John Dunford is going into sixth forms. At Bushey Meads, the \u00a340,000 of Brown money will cover a theoretical deficit of \u00a326,000. The remainder will be contingency and if any is spare, spent on books and equipment for science and IT. \"The Brown money is very important to us. The thing that we appreciate very much is that it has come directly to schools. Its unfortunate that we have to use it largely to wipe out our deficit,\" said Dr Coleman. \"Schools went grant maintained originally because they were under-funded. It certainly didn't go on long enough to put right all the things that were needed here. We are an example of the better off and we have problems, so goodness knows what some of my colleagues have to deal with.\" Where the money goes Yoxford primary school, Suffolk Type: County, mixed, ages 4-9 Head teacher: Peter Scuffil Number of pupils: 62 Spending this year: \u00a3157,083 How much extra money from Gordon Brown in the budget? \u00a33,000 Spending it on: Maths and games equipment, reading books, CD-Roms With twice the extra money, what would you spend it on?

NEWS IN BRIEF The BBC is to seek an urgent appeal hearing after a judge ruled that it has no legal protection against Talk Radio broadcasting so-called \"live\" commentary on sporting events by presenters sitting in front of a TV screen. Nicolas Anelka could miss France's Group D decider against Holland on Wednesday after an old knee injury flared up last week. The Real Madrid star has been unable to take part in the last two French training sessions and has been forced to stay at the team hotel to rest his left knee. Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie has vowed to go teetotal during the football season after being banned from international selection for three months for breaking a team curfew while on duty with the England Under-21s. Former Liverpool captain Steve McMahon was today being questioned by police over an alleged assault at a party in Formby, Merseyside earlier today.

In a statement, Jack Straw told the Commons that the deaths, discovered in a refrigerated lorry last night, were \"a most terrible human tragedy.\" He said: \"This terrible tragedy must serve as a stark warning to others who might be tempted to place their fate in the hands of organised traffickers.\" Mr Straw told MPs that the dead were the victims of serious organised criminals who make huge profits from smuggling illegal immigrants. The prime minister would be raising the incident and the need for ever better international co-operation against people traffickers with other European leaders at the EU summit in Portugal. The bodies were found by a customs officer in the back of a refrigerated truck in the port of Dover yesterday, prompting an international police investigation. Another two people were found alive in the rear of the Dutch-registered vehicle, which was carrying tomatoes, and crossed the Channel on a ferry from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. The refrigeration unit was switched off. The dead - 54 men and four women - and the survivors appeared to be from the Far East, possibly Chinese, the Home Office said. Police arrested the Dutch driver of the 15m-long truck. The vehicle aroused suspicion because it was registered to a company, Van Der Spek, which had not used the route before, ferry operators P&amp;O Stena Line said. Government leaders pledged new attempts to crack down on international crime gangs who traffic in illegal immigrants, charging up to \u00a320,000 per person. The survivors, both men, were hospitalised and were expected to recover, but were too traumatised by their horrific experience to be questioned immediately. Customs officials said the truck, which arrived just before midnight, was searched because it fitted a \"profile\" of suspect vehicles. British police and forces on the continent began trying to track the movements of the truck before it boarded the ferry. The vehicle left Belgium on Sunday, the hottest day of the year in England and parts of northern Europe, with temperatures reaching 30C (86F). In April, the government introduced a fine of \u00a32,000 per person on truckers caught smuggling illegal immigrants. Refugee advocates condemned the immigrant smuggling rings, but Refugee Council chief executive Nick Hardwick said the main problem was that \"it is virtually impossible for people feeling persecution to enter Britain legally.\" \"They are therefore forced to search for such desperate measures in their search for sanctuary,\" he said. Smuggling illegal immigrants has become a profitable - and dangerous - business in Europe. At least 173 people drowned last year in the Adriatic attempting to cross from Albania to Italy.",

Today's gangster is much more likely to drive an SUV (sports utility vehicle) for his loathsome trade of drug-dealing, extortion and general racketeering.

Just as well-heeled mothers like a four-wheel drive so they can protect their hordes of kids from the dangers of city traffic while showing off their wealth, status and procreative ambitions, so the gangster wants a rottweiler of the road to both intimidate and impress his rivals and victims. </p> <p>Kenneth Noye - who was connected with the money-laundering of the Brinks Mat robbery, the murder of a policeman and was finally arrested for a road rage killing - was the proud owner of an L-reg Land Rover Discovery. In Brent, north London, last February, various SUVs were involved in a terrifying shoot-out in the car park of a leisure complex with hundreds of people caught inside. It all started because the girlfriends of rival criminal gangs got into an argument about parking places. It seems you need at lot of room for an SUV, which gives the driver a feeling of power and strength. You can look down on fellow drivers from patrician heights and feel distanced from the hoi polloi. </p> <p>The difference in the vehicles driven by the wealthy mum and the gangland leader are in the all- important details. \"Bobby\", who used to be involved with a notorious north London gang, says: \"The glass must be blacked out, the sound system powerful enough to permanently change the rhythm of your heartbeat, and the spare wheel cover has to come from a dealer in Park Lane or Knightsbridge - to show you have the money to go to the best places and pay up front and in full. Basically, it is like a very comfortable tank in a very dirty war: a real fuck-off set of wheels.\" </p> <p>Although the SUV offers protection and security, gangsters - be they Yardies, East End boys or Triads - still like a flash car for the evening, or \"non-work\" assignations. And some people aspire to this gangster fashion.

Pat Goldman, a criminologist undertaking a study of British gangsters, says: \"The whole point of being a criminal involved in drugs or prostitution is that it affords you status you otherwise would not have had.

I enjoy Simon Jenkins, Andrew Marr, Will Hutton, Andrew Rawnsley and Hugo Young most of all. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines: </strong> <br> Private Eye, the National Geographic and New Yorker. I'm very influenced by the covers of weeklies - the Spectator, New Statesman, Economist - which of course is very superficial of me. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> <br> Racy novels, good adventure stories, detective novels and books about the sea. I'm an absolute glutton for CS Forester's Hornblower novels. And any political biographies - De Gaulle, Gladstone, even John Major I'm glad to say. </p> <p> <strong> Films: </strong> <br> I do like colossal films, huge films. Braveheart, Titanic, Gladiator.

The wonderful thing about the British press is the huge variety and completely anarchic way one can read about almost anything. I enjoy Simon Jenkins, Andrew Marr, Will Hutton, Andrew Rawnsley and Hugo Young most of all. Magazines: Private Eye, the National Geographic and New Yorker. I'm very influenced by the covers of weeklies - the Spectator, New Statesman, Economist - which of course is very superficial of me. Books: Racy novels, good adventure stories, detective novels and books about the sea. I'm an absolute glutton for CS Forester's Hornblower novels. And any political biographies - De Gaulle, Gladstone, even John Major I'm glad to say. Films: I do like colossal films, huge films. Braveheart, Titanic, Gladiator. All-time favourite is Lawrence of Arabia. Television: I'm completely sold on the recent costume dramas - Wives and Daughters, all the Austens, Copperfield. Ali G is unmissable.

      "body": "<p><strong>LindaGrant1</strong><br> Hi. I'm here. People seem to want to know about the difference between writing journalism and writing fiction. I don't think there's such a big wall. Both of them ought to be about good writing and telling stories.</p> <p><strong>blackbird21</strong> <br> Did you ever really expect to win the Orange Prize? Considering Zadie Smith was supposedly the favourite and her publishers were already putting stickers on White Teeth with 'Orange Prize winner' on?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1</strong><br> Blackbird: Did I expect to win the Orange Prize? Well, not myself, no. In fact friends can testify that up to being in the car on the way to the ceremony I was adamantly saying that I wasn't. But I have to say that starting around a week before, people started telling me that they thought I was going to win. And some of those were fairly close to the process. However I just thought that they were being nice. I found out later that someone bet on me and won \u00a3400. I did think that the field was more open than others thought. I wouldn't have been surprised if Judy Budnitz or Elizabeth Strout won.</p> <p><strong>shem32</strong><br> What's your attitude to a woman-only prize? Would you appear in a woman-only anthology?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> shem32: My attitude to a women only prize? Well, every prize has some kind of restriction on it. The Booker excludes American writers (and it would be a very different shortlist if it didn't.) There are prizes I'm not eligible for - first novel by a writer under 35 for example. In the end, however, prizes shouldn't really be judged as the \"best\" book but rather as a marketing exercise to sell books. Every shortlisted writer on any prize finds their sales rocketing. As for appearing in an all-women anthology - of course, the same as if it were an all-UK anthology or all Jewish.</p> <p><strong>Mrudu </strong><br> Is writing for journalism any different from writing for fiction? Are you working on anything now? How much research did your book involve? Have you read Zadie Smith's book. If yes, your opinion?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> Mrudu:I read a few books for the research but principally, I would say that the two most important pieces of research I did were with an elderly lady living in Jerusalem who talked to me for hours about her own life during that period, and walking the streets of Tel Aviv for days on end. As for Zadie Smith's book, no I haven't read it, quite deliberately. I decided not to read any of the books on the shortlist before the prize was announced because I didn't want to get depressed, thinking, well, I can't possibly win. Finally, I'm going off tomorrow to Cornwall to start work on another novel, this one set in Liverpool, in the present</p> <p><strong>sgcc2 </strong><br> Do you see obvious parallels between the Israel of When I Lived... and Britain under New Labour: a people hoping to put a dark past behind them, then experiencing the dream fading, the fudge setting in, even the buildings gradually losing their gloss? Was it deliberate?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> sgcc2: I have to say that I never gave New Labour a thought when I was writing this, but the metaphor of Tel Aviv (and indeed the whole book) is about idealism and its failures. What I really was thinking about was the war in Kosovo which was going on at the time. I couldn't make my mind up what I thought about it and it occurred to me that in the end it didn't actually matter as I wasn't affected one way or the other. The characters in my book, however, are in a very different situation. Whatever they decide will determine their future. I think this isn't understood about the contemporary situation in the Middle East.</p> <p><strong>CCole </strong><br> Who would you cite as your literary influences?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> Ccole: My literary influences - Dickens (another journalist turned novelist), the Jewish American big hitters like Roth and Bellow, and women writers like Nancy Mitford and Jean Rhys who are fantastic on how women construct their identity through clothes.</p> <p><strong>tamara </strong><br> Would you call yourself a journalistic novelist bearing in mind your other career?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> tamara: I'm not sure what a journalistic novelist is, but I don't think I like the sound of it.</p> <p><strong>mmreed </strong><br> You've written about your mother's experiences with Alzheimer's... Family memoir seems to be an increasingly popular genre (I'm thinking of Dave Eggars at the moment with his story of bringing up his younger brother). Is it hard to write 'truthfully' about family? Did you feel intrusive? Did you feel you were producing a piece of writing for all or a helpful text for others with the same problems and issues?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> mmreed: Writing Remind Me was a difficult decision to make and I wouldn't have done so if my sister hadn't srtongly supported me. The point is that the two of us felt very very alone when we were going through our problems and the whole discourse on the subject was dominated by people saying, well, of course, I love my mother I could never put her in a home. Someone had to break out of this. But I think that the book has a much broader message, which is that none of us really know our parents.</p> <p><strong>tamara </strong><br> And have you read any of the Catherine Sayler mysteries by American crime writer Linda Grant...? (Or are you leading a double literary life?)</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> tamara: The funny thing about Catherine Sayler is that she's about the same age as me and has the same hairstyle, only blonde. I looked at her website. But no, I haven't read them, mainly because I'm not much of a one for crime fiction. I notice on Amazon (all writers are obsessed with the Amazon sales figures) that her rankings have shot up since I won the Orange. </p> <p><strong>rgsharp </strong><br> What do you think of Andrea Dworkin's take on Israel (and her ultra-emotive journalism, for that matter)?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> rgsharp: I think Andrea Dworkin's take on Israel is extremely interesting (more so than her absurd idea that there should be a country for women.) She's trying to address something people find hard to get to grips with, that maybe there is more than one victim here and that victims are capable of victimising each other. I think this makes many people fairly annoyed because it's much easier to find a set of good guys and a set of bad guys. She's trying to assess how the experience of anti-semitism affected the Jews and in particular what happened when they tried to fight back. I think this is well worth listening to. BUT I also believe that her view of contemporary Israel is fairly out of date, like the fact that she'd never heard of Dana International.</p> <p><strong>dan314 </strong><br> Did you find that your experience as a journalist helped or hindered you in writing When I lived in Modern Times?</p> <p><strong>LindaGrant1 </strong><br> dan314: Being a journalist means that I'm more interested in what goes on outside my own front door than in my own psyche.

It was a damned sight harder to get other people to take them seriously. Every review referred to the fact that I was a journalist, as if this was a kind of warning. I have worked very hard to develop a deceptively transparent style and never more so than in Modern Times where the writing was supposed to mimic the architecture, very simple and very unadorned. I don't want the reader to have their attention drawn to the language. I want the language to be supple and simple and to contain a punch because you don't notice that it's creeping up on you.

      "bodyText": "LindaGrant1 Hi. I'm here. People seem to want to know about the difference between writing journalism and writing fiction. I don't think there's such a big wall. Both of them ought to be about good writing and telling stories. blackbird21 Did you ever really expect to win the Orange Prize? Considering Zadie Smith was supposedly the favourite and her publishers were already putting stickers on White Teeth with 'Orange Prize winner' on? LindaGrant1 Blackbird: Did I expect to win the Orange Prize? Well, not myself, no. In fact friends can testify that up to being in the car on the way to the ceremony I was adamantly saying that I wasn't. But I have to say that starting around a week before, people started telling me that they thought I was going to win. And some of those were fairly close to the process. However I just thought that they were being nice. I found out later that someone bet on me and won \u00a3400. I did think that the field was more open than others thought. I wouldn't have been surprised if Judy Budnitz or Elizabeth Strout won. shem32 What's your attitude to a woman-only prize? Would you appear in a woman-only anthology? LindaGrant1 shem32: My attitude to a women only prize? Well, every prize has some kind of restriction on it. The Booker excludes American writers (and it would be a very different shortlist if it didn't.) There are prizes I'm not eligible for - first novel by a writer under 35 for example. In the end, however, prizes shouldn't really be judged as the \"best\" book but rather as a marketing exercise to sell books. Every shortlisted writer on any prize finds their sales rocketing. As for appearing in an all-women anthology - of course, the same as if it were an all-UK anthology or all Jewish. Mrudu Is writing for journalism any different from writing for fiction? Are you working on anything now? How much research did your book involve? Have you read Zadie Smith's book. If yes, your opinion? LindaGrant1 Mrudu:I read a few books for the research but principally, I would say that the two most important pieces of research I did were with an elderly lady living in Jerusalem who talked to me for hours about her own life during that period, and walking the streets of Tel Aviv for days on end. As for Zadie Smith's book, no I haven't read it, quite deliberately. I decided not to read any of the books on the shortlist before the prize was announced because I didn't want to get depressed, thinking, well, I can't possibly win. Finally, I'm going off tomorrow to Cornwall to start work on another novel, this one set in Liverpool, in the present sgcc2 Do you see obvious parallels between the Israel of When I Lived... and Britain under New Labour: a people hoping to put a dark past behind them, then experiencing the dream fading, the fudge setting in, even the buildings gradually losing their gloss? Was it deliberate? LindaGrant1 sgcc2: I have to say that I never gave New Labour a thought when I was writing this, but the metaphor of Tel Aviv (and indeed the whole book) is about idealism and its failures. What I really was thinking about was the war in Kosovo which was going on at the time. I couldn't make my mind up what I thought about it and it occurred to me that in the end it didn't actually matter as I wasn't affected one way or the other. The characters in my book, however, are in a very different situation. Whatever they decide will determine their future. I think this isn't understood about the contemporary situation in the Middle East. CCole Who would you cite as your literary influences? LindaGrant1 Ccole: My literary influences - Dickens (another journalist turned novelist), the Jewish American big hitters like Roth and Bellow, and women writers like Nancy Mitford and Jean Rhys who are fantastic on how women construct their identity through clothes. tamara Would you call yourself a journalistic novelist bearing in mind your other career? LindaGrant1 tamara: I'm not sure what a journalistic novelist is, but I don't think I like the sound of it. mmreed You've written about your mother's experiences with Alzheimer's... Family memoir seems to be an increasingly popular genre (I'm thinking of Dave Eggars at the moment with his story of bringing up his younger brother). Is it hard to write 'truthfully' about family? Did you feel intrusive? Did you feel you were producing a piece of writing for all or a helpful text for others with the same problems and issues? LindaGrant1 mmreed: Writing Remind Me was a difficult decision to make and I wouldn't have done so if my sister hadn't srtongly supported me. The point is that the two of us felt very very alone when we were going through our problems and the whole discourse on the subject was dominated by people saying, well, of course, I love my mother I could never put her in a home. Someone had to break out of this. But I think that the book has a much broader message, which is that none of us really know our parents. tamara And have you read any of the Catherine Sayler mysteries by American crime writer Linda Grant...? (Or are you leading a double literary life?) LindaGrant1 tamara: The funny thing about Catherine Sayler is that she's about the same age as me and has the same hairstyle, only blonde. I looked at her website. But no, I haven't read them, mainly because I'm not much of a one for crime fiction. I notice on Amazon (all writers are obsessed with the Amazon sales figures) that her rankings have shot up since I won the Orange. rgsharp What do you think of Andrea Dworkin's take on Israel (and her ultra-emotive journalism, for that matter)? LindaGrant1 rgsharp: I think Andrea Dworkin's take on Israel is extremely interesting (more so than her absurd idea that there should be a country for women.) She's trying to address something people find hard to get to grips with, that maybe there is more than one victim here and that victims are capable of victimising each other. I think this makes many people fairly annoyed because it's much easier to find a set of good guys and a set of bad guys. She's trying to assess how the experience of anti-semitism affected the Jews and in particular what happened when they tried to fight back. I think this is well worth listening to. BUT I also believe that her view of contemporary Israel is fairly out of date, like the fact that she'd never heard of Dana International. dan314 Did you find that your experience as a journalist helped or hindered you in writing When I lived in Modern Times? LindaGrant1 dan314: Being a journalist means that I'm more interested in what goes on outside my own front door than in my own psyche. One way in which it hinders is that I think I'm too much of a stickler for factual accuracy. I should liberate my imagination a bit more. I'm amazed to find that friends of mine who have written memoir type books have not always told the strict truth. Tally43 Has winning the prize given you any more confidence in your skills as a writer - or do you think that the whole idea of literary prizes is bogus? Has it changed things for you at all? LindaGrant1 tally 43: Well, I've been accused of being arrogant. I was actually fairly confident of my skills as a writer. It was a damned sight harder to get other people to take them seriously. Every review referred to the fact that I was a journalist, as if this was a kind of warning. I have worked very hard to develop a deceptively transparent style and never more so than in Modern Times where the writing was supposed to mimic the architecture, very simple and very unadorned. I don't want the reader to have their attention drawn to the language. I want the language to be supple and simple and to contain a punch because you don't notice that it's creeping up on you. Has the prize made a difference? Absolutely. I feel that I no longer have to struggle to be taken seriously. naomi2 Do you think the printed novel is becoming an outmoded form? Do you think traditional publishing has a future? Obviously the computer screen cannot replace the portability of a book, but what about WAP phones and palm pilots etc? Do you have any particular interest in new technologies? Also as a print journalist, all these new developments in publishing must also impact on you? LindaGrant1 Naomi: I think that the printed book will definitely become an outmoded form. In fact I was saying to a friend on Friday, one day people will be judged on their age as \"she's the sort of person who still has bookshelves\", like I'm the sort of person who is old enough to still have some vinyl hanging about the house. I LOVE new technology. I love living in modern times. The book will continue to exist, though not in the same form. It will be downloaded from the internet onto some book-sized reader. This exists already but there are problems about the weight because of the battery. But it will be fixed. shem32 Did you like the Ya Ya Sisterhood book? I ask because there was much snobbish sneering when it made the shortlist... Should the orange shortlist be different from the Booker? - or is it just about 'the best' books? (pretty subjective, anyway...) LindaGrant1 I haven't read Divine Scretes, as I haven't read any of the others on the shortlist. I think that if the judges put it on the shortlist, there will have been a reason. I'm a big fan of well-written non-literary fiction. The trouble is finding the stuff that IS well-written.

The first example of a paper letting its website scoop it happened three years ago, when the Dallas Morning News published its scoop about a confession by the Oklahoma bomber, Timothy McVeigh, 15 hours before the story was due to hit the streets. At the time it was called \"the biggest change in American papers in 25 years\", by one commentator. </p> <p>In both cases the simple fact that the story was broken on the net was an event in itself, and was reported as such; the merits of the actual story almost took second place to the mechanics of its delivery.

But, once the novelty of net scooping has fallen away, we are left trying to work out a whole new set of rules about how and when to use the net to break a story. </p> <p>It is not just newspapers who have the problem; weekly magazines are faced with the problem on an even larger scale. You publish on a Wednesday, but you get that brilliant exclusive on a Monday. Dare you wait? Once it was no problem - you had only print-based rivals, but now there are now so many websites offering up to date information on everything </p> <p>There is never going to be an easy answer to this - but the guidelines are pretty simple. The net exists, it is not going to go away. If you have a website, you have the option to use it to break stories. However, if you do it, you have to make sure you get credit for it. Which means that once you put the story up on the site, you simultaneously have to tell the world you've done it. </p> <p>Let's consider another couple of examples of stories which show the right and the wrong way to do it. </p> <p>Last month, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal were handed the story of the proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways. The arrangement was very simple: they could have the story for their papers, but they could not contact sources for background or comment, and they could not break it on their websites in advance of the papers being printed. </p> <p>Unfortunately for them, and the airlines' PR people, the Financial Times got hold of the story, and broke it on its site six hours ahead of the US papers' self-imposed embargo. Not only that, but it also sent out an email to subscribers, informing them of the big story. A great result for the FT, in a market where minutes can literally mean millions, and (hurrah!) a potentially crushing blow for cushy deals between journalists and PR types. </p> <p>Next, a rumour that may or may not be true, but that anyone involved with net publishing will recognise as all too believable. </p> <p>Sunday Newspaper X had a rather juicy exclusive. As is standard practice in such cases, it planned to break the story in its final edition to avoid other papers stealing the story. However, no one remembered to tell the internet editor, and somehow the story was inadvertently put onto their website with the first edition, and was immediately picked up by their rivals. </p> <p>As with most things on the net, if you get it right, you are destined for glory. The consequences of mistakes, however, are normally too miserable to even think about.</p> <p>\u0095 Simon Waldman is head of Guardian Unlimited</p>",

Once it was no problem - you had only print-based rivals, but now there are now so many websites offering up to date information on everything There is never going to be an easy answer to this - but the guidelines are pretty simple. The net exists, it is not going to go away. If you have a website, you have the option to use it to break stories. However, if you do it, you have to make sure you get credit for it. Which means that once you put the story up on the site, you simultaneously have to tell the world you've done it. Let's consider another couple of examples of stories which show the right and the wrong way to do it. Last month, the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal were handed the story of the proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways. The arrangement was very simple: they could have the story for their papers, but they could not contact sources for background or comment, and they could not break it on their websites in advance of the papers being printed. Unfortunately for them, and the airlines' PR people, the Financial Times got hold of the story, and broke it on its site six hours ahead of the US papers' self-imposed embargo. Not only that, but it also sent out an email to subscribers, informing them of the big story. A great result for the FT, in a market where minutes can literally mean millions, and (hurrah!) a potentially crushing blow for cushy deals between journalists and PR types. Next, a rumour that may or may not be true, but that anyone involved with net publishing will recognise as all too believable. Sunday Newspaper X had a rather juicy exclusive. As is standard practice in such cases, it planned to break the story in its final edition to avoid other papers stealing the story. However, no one remembered to tell the internet editor, and somehow the story was inadvertently put onto their website with the first edition, and was immediately picked up by their rivals. As with most things on the net, if you get it right, you are destined for glory. The consequences of mistakes, however, are normally too miserable to even think about. \u0095 Simon Waldman is head of Guardian Unlimited",

But Davies insisted: \"There are procedures and processes that must be taken before a country is excluded.\" However, although Davies is primarily working to ensure England's further participation in the tournament and to limit the damage to England's 2006 World Cup bid, he was nevertheless quick to condemn the actions of the English hooligans. \"There is pressure that the team and we can put on,\" he said, \"and all I can ask is that we all act in a way to make these people realise the damage they are doing. We hope and believe that they will understand the seriousness of the situation.\" EURONEWS Muzzy Izzet is struggling to be fit for Turkey's crucial Euro 2000 game against co-hosts Belgium in Brussels tonight. The Leicester midfielder admitted: \"There is a lot of bruising around the ankle. I am just trying to rest up and keep it elevated.\" Norway coach Nils Johan Semb has accused Scottish referee Hugh Dallas of allowing himself to be \"tricked\" after Yugoslavia won a bad-tempered match 1-0 in Liege. \"We couldn't find our rhythm because of the antics of the Yugoslavs,\" said Semb. EURORUMOUR with KAREL POBORSKY Hi there! I'm Britney Spears. I've been following your soccer tournament on US television, and I just had to jet over from the land of the free and the home of the brave to meet up with that sexy Czech guy called Karel who had such a good game against France last Friday. I was told this is where I'd find him, but there doesn't seem to be anybody here. I suppose I may as well while away the hours reading out these rumours, although I'll be surprised if you can hear a word I say over the noise coming from that cupboard, which sounds not dissimilar to the desperate cries of a bound-and-gagged international footballer about to miss his one and only chance to date a pop star. Chelsea and, surprisingly, Arsenal are interested in \u00a33.5m Nick Barmby. Everton are not prepared to meet Barmby's increased wage demands and will sell before the player becomes available on a Bosman free next summer. Liverpool have offered Middlesbrough \u00a35m for Germany's left-back Christian Ziege. Arsenal and Lazio representatives have met in Brussels to broker the \u00a318m transfer of Marc Overmars. Sunderland want to sign Czech Republic midfielder Radek Bejbl. The 27-year-old is not guaranteed a place in Atletico Madrid's starting eleven and would be available for \u00a33m. Middlesbrough boss Bryan Robson has made a \u00a316m bid for Christina Aguilera. Tore Andre Flo is rumoured to be a \u00a314m target for Rangers. But chairman David Murray has played down the suggestion: \"There is no chance of Flo joining Rangers at the moment but we are confident of signing a striker before the start of the season.\" Well, that's the lot. I suppose I'll have to go. I was kinda hoping Karel would ask me to the prom. Ah well, do you have Jiri Nemec's phone number? TV AND RADI(EUR)O ITV: Euro 2000 Live (7.30pm) Turkey v Belgium or Italy v Sweden? We think it might be Turkey v Belgium. Although it could be Italy v Sweden. BBC1: MOTD @ Euro 2000 (11.30pm) Definitely Turkey v Belgium and Italy v Sweden. ITV: Euro 2000 - The Big Match (12.30am) Probably Italy v Sweden if they showed Turkey v Belgium earlier on. BBC1: Euro 2000 Replay (12.35am) Although if ITV threw in a curveball and showed Italy v Sweden it might be Turkey v Belgium instead. British Eurosport: Euro 2000 Football - Live (7pm) This is likely to be Belgium v Turkey, so if you get Eurosport you'll want Italy v Sweden on ITV in order to flick between both matches with your remote. But what if you don't get Eurosport and you're Belgian? Euro 2000 Football (10pm to 7.15am) Turkey v Belgium and Italy v Sweden will be on this, surely. Look at the amount of time they've got to fill! Radio 5 Live: Euro 2000 Live (7pm) Both matches. At once. We reckon.",

The judges, sitting in London, ordered that the terms of the questions addressed to the jury should not be disclosed by the press. Today's brief preliminary hearing saw the beginning of Martin's bid for freedom. He was not at court today. The full appeal is expected to be heard later this year.

Before Martin's counsel Anthony Scrivener QC began to make his application to the court concerning the questioning of jurors, Lord Justice Rose told him that the court was \"sympathetic, subject to anything the Crown want to say, to the idea that the jury should be asked one or two questions\". He added: \"We are not sympathetic to them being set an exam paper.\" At the full appeal Martin's defence team is expected to argue that a fair trial was not possible because there was an atmosphere of intimidation for jurors and witnesses.

      "body": "<p>Here's a neat economic model for the new economy. First, wait for a leading media company to invest in high-quality journalism - an (ahem) incisive piece of analysis like this, for instance - and to give it away on its website. Then steal that rather excellent headline above it, which you make available on your own website, something that copyright law allows. Next, charge leading companies \u00a31,700 a month each to get access to that headline, if it leads to the sort of piece they want to read. Finally - and this will crack you up - tell the Guardian it must pay you \u00a320 each time 1,000 people look up its own story from your site. </p> <p>Oh, and then collect $21m from investors who think your site is so cool it is worth between $60-$100m. </p> <p>Far-fetched? Not if you are <a href=\"http://www.moreover.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Moreover.com</a>, one of the growing number of \"news aggregators\" building up market valuations as fast as \"pure content\" websites are collapsing. Last week, Moreover.com completed a funding round from Reuters and Atlas Venture, among others, that it hopes will let it feed other people's headlines to 400,000 websites by the start of next year. At present, Moreover.com is harvesting headlines from 1,500 sources, headlines that it gives away in category-based feeds to 50,000 sites - which can choose, say, to offer a feed about biotech news or space-science news. Users click on headlines to read the full stories on the originating sites - which can sell advertisements against those page views. The company is now working on providing auction feeds and last-minute flight feeds. </p> <p>The timing of the funding will not have gone unnoticed at <a href=\"http://www.Salon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Salon.com</a>, TheStreet.co.uk, and other editorial-content sites that have recently been forced to examine their own business models. Last week, as staff at crime-news site <a href=\"http://www.APBnews.com\" target=\"_NEW\">APBnews.com</a> were working for free in the hope of salvation,<a href=\"http://www.thebullet.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\"> thebullet.co.uk</a>, a UK media site, announced it had \"shut down day-to-day operations\" while it considered its future. </p> <p>Nick Denton, a former FT journalist who is Moreover.com's chief executive, believes his low-cost, high-value service has a business model that content sites cannot match. It makes money at both ends of the content-transfer process: banks and private companies pay for custom feeds that serve their own needs; at the other end, it charges content sites for the traffic it delivers to them - which can be far greater than advertising or search-engine positioning would bring. </p> <p>Typically, a news aggregator such as <a href=\"http://www.Yahoo.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Yahoo!</a> charges 1-3 cents to a publisher's site every time a headline is clicked through from Yahoo!'s news pages. Some publications will pay up to 10 cents a click; and a financial site such as E-Trade might pay a dollar a click. Moreover.com charges in the range of 2-6 cents - which Denton says is \"about a hundredth of the cost of the clickthrough from banner ads\". \"There's an incentive for content sites to pay to promote,\" he explains. \"We've 1,500 sources. No one publisher is an absolute must-have.\" (Guardian Unlimited, which runs its own free content-distribution service to other websites, does not pay Moreover.com or other aggregators for referrals.) </p> <p>The challenge for content-based websites is finding a way to pay for all that expensive original journalism. Consumers have rarely been happy to pay to read articles online, unless, as with the Wall Street Journal, it might help them make more money. Banner advertising is rarely the answer even for the larger sites. Denton sees only three options for pure-content websites. First, pretend to be an aggregator by linking users to relevant pages on other people's websites. </p> <p>Second, syndicate everything - taking a cue from the ubiquitous Reuters, or mapping companies such as Mapquest. \"If it costs too much to get visitors to your site, get your content out where the viewers are,\" advises Denton. </p> <p>Third, go offline as well as online. Tech-news bible the Industry Standard subsidises its loss-making website with a hugely profitable weekly print magazine, whose ad revenue is more than $100m. </p> <p>It's clear who the real winner will be in online media, says Denton: \"Yahoo!, the world's most rapidly growing media company ever, doesn't produce an ounce of original content. The Yahoo! effect is immensely powerful. Add up the market valuation of all the information aggregators out there, and they've got 100 times the combined market value of every pure original content site.\" </p> <p>But you don't need to be a media giant to be a successful aggregator. Take Jim Romenesko, an Illinois journalist whose fascination with industry snippets led him last May to rise before dawn to compile his daily mediagossip.com digest of online papers' must-reads. The popularity of his one-man site, not just among hacks, led to an approach from the Poynter Institute, a journalism school where he now runs its site, <a href=\"http://www.medianews.org.\"> MediaNews</a>. Some big players would envy his traffic and \"brand recognition\". \"I ran <a href=\"http://www.mediagossip.com\" target=\"_NEW\">mediagossip.com</a> for several months before Poynter came to me,\" Romenesko says. \"If I knew anything about ad sales, I could have probably made a living on my own. The sites that will succeed will be lean and not beholden to Wall Street.\" </p> <p>Inside.com, a new media-industry site established by top US magazine journalists including Kurt Andersen, could hardly be seen as lean. Having raised $25m, it has hired writers from Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and the Wall Street Journal to offer the inside scoop on the publishing, film, broadcast and music industries. Subscribers are asked to pay $199 a year to catch the buzz - a controversial business model, given recent re-valuations of content sites. But Andersen, who has edited Spy and New York magazine, dismisses this year's depression in content-sites' values, which he feels is \"as extreme and unthinking as 1999 mania\". </p> <p>Yet he, too, admires the aggregators' strategy. \"The brilliance of Yahoo! is that it's national and it's local, it's cheap to produce and it gives its audience real depth. The big problem facing Salon, which is essentially a national alternative newspaper produced every day, is that it's national, and has no local advertisers to whom it can deliver futon buyers or concert-goers.\" </p> <p>Critics of Andersen's site, however, raise questions about its own business model. Journalists are expensive and troublesome to employ. Moreover.com, which employs 33 staff, claims its 10,000 daily headlines could be handled by four people. Romenesko doubts whether users will pay money upfront: \"Web users simply demand that content be free. Porn they'll pay for, but news and features they won't.\" </p> <p> Nick Denton sees Inside.com as doomed. \"I'm gobsmacked,\" he says. \"After this incredible catalogue of failures in subscription-based content, to set up a site like that in 2000 is quite an amazing venture whose timing could not be worse.\" </p> <p>Andrew Ross, executive vice- president of Salon.com, argues that content providers and content aggregators need each other. \"There is no question that when, say, AOL or Yahoo! - the pioneers of content aggregation - turn on the hose, a content provider's traffic can go through the roof. At the same time, content aggregators need content - and, as more websites emerge and grow, so, presumably, will the demand for both of our services.\" </p> <p>Ross's fear is that those who control the portals to content will merely rely, lazily, on the \"usual suspects - the traditional wire services, the branded old media that do little more than shovel up their pre-existing content in 'digital' form - at the expense of those who are delivering original, web-based content. Right now, there are an encouraging number of producers and editors - like Denton of Moreover - at the content aggregators who seem favourably disposed to the kind of original content that a provider like Salon.com produces on a daily basis. But that takes judgment, intelligence, and person power - all of which can easily fall victim to the deadening forces of mediocrity (and 'consolidation') that hovers ceaselessly over journalistic enterprise and enterprises.\" </p> <p>On the web, no content-originator is an island. As the aggregators and web-loggers have learned, users rarely want to stay at one site if the article they want is on another. If your site does not help lead them to it, they will find less reason to visit your site next time - even a well-resourced, quality editorial site as produced by traditional newspapers. </p> <p> David Rowan is editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",

It makes money at both ends of the content-transfer process: banks and private companies pay for custom feeds that serve their own needs; at the other end, it charges content sites for the traffic it delivers to them - which can be far greater than advertising or search-engine positioning would bring. Typically, a news aggregator such as Yahoo! charges 1-3 cents to a publisher's site every time a headline is clicked through from Yahoo!'s news pages. Some publications will pay up to 10 cents a click; and a financial site such as E-Trade might pay a dollar a click. Moreover.com charges in the range of 2-6 cents - which Denton says is \"about a hundredth of the cost of the clickthrough from banner ads\". \"There's an incentive for content sites to pay to promote,\" he explains. \"We've 1,500 sources. No one publisher is an absolute must-have.\" (Guardian Unlimited, which runs its own free content-distribution service to other websites, does not pay Moreover.com or other aggregators for referrals.) The challenge for content-based websites is finding a way to pay for all that expensive original journalism. Consumers have rarely been happy to pay to read articles online, unless, as with the Wall Street Journal, it might help them make more money. Banner advertising is rarely the answer even for the larger sites. Denton sees only three options for pure-content websites. First, pretend to be an aggregator by linking users to relevant pages on other people's websites. Second, syndicate everything - taking a cue from the ubiquitous Reuters, or mapping companies such as Mapquest. \"If it costs too much to get visitors to your site, get your content out where the viewers are,\" advises Denton. Third, go offline as well as online. Tech-news bible the Industry Standard subsidises its loss-making website with a hugely profitable weekly print magazine, whose ad revenue is more than $100m. It's clear who the real winner will be in online media, says Denton: \"Yahoo!, the world's most rapidly growing media company ever, doesn't produce an ounce of original content. The Yahoo! effect is immensely powerful. Add up the market valuation of all the information aggregators out there, and they've got 100 times the combined market value of every pure original content site.\" But you don't need to be a media giant to be a successful aggregator. Take Jim Romenesko, an Illinois journalist whose fascination with industry snippets led him last May to rise before dawn to compile his daily mediagossip.com digest of online papers' must-reads. The popularity of his one-man site, not just among hacks, led to an approach from the Poynter Institute, a journalism school where he now runs its site, MediaNews. Some big players would envy his traffic and \"brand recognition\". \"I ran mediagossip.com for several months before Poynter came to me,\" Romenesko says. \"If I knew anything about ad sales, I could have probably made a living on my own. The sites that will succeed will be lean and not beholden to Wall Street.\" Inside.com, a new media-industry site established by top US magazine journalists including Kurt Andersen, could hardly be seen as lean. Having raised $25m, it has hired writers from Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and the Wall Street Journal to offer the inside scoop on the publishing, film, broadcast and music industries. Subscribers are asked to pay $199 a year to catch the buzz - a controversial business model, given recent re-valuations of content sites. But Andersen, who has edited Spy and New York magazine, dismisses this year's depression in content-sites' values, which he feels is \"as extreme and unthinking as 1999 mania\". Yet he, too, admires the aggregators' strategy. \"The brilliance of Yahoo! is that it's national and it's local, it's cheap to produce and it gives its audience real depth. The big problem facing Salon, which is essentially a national alternative newspaper produced every day, is that it's national, and has no local advertisers to whom it can deliver futon buyers or concert-goers.\" Critics of Andersen's site, however, raise questions about its own business model. Journalists are expensive and troublesome to employ. Moreover.com, which employs 33 staff, claims its 10,000 daily headlines could be handled by four people. Romenesko doubts whether users will pay money upfront: \"Web users simply demand that content be free. Porn they'll pay for, but news and features they won't.\" Nick Denton sees Inside.com as doomed. \"I'm gobsmacked,\" he says. \"After this incredible catalogue of failures in subscription-based content, to set up a site like that in 2000 is quite an amazing venture whose timing could not be worse.\" Andrew Ross, executive vice- president of Salon.com, argues that content providers and content aggregators need each other. \"There is no question that when, say, AOL or Yahoo! - the pioneers of content aggregation - turn on the hose, a content provider's traffic can go through the roof. At the same time, content aggregators need content - and, as more websites emerge and grow, so, presumably, will the demand for both of our services.\" Ross's fear is that those who control the portals to content will merely rely, lazily, on the \"usual suspects - the traditional wire services, the branded old media that do little more than shovel up their pre-existing content in 'digital' form - at the expense of those who are delivering original, web-based content. Right now, there are an encouraging number of producers and editors - like Denton of Moreover - at the content aggregators who seem favourably disposed to the kind of original content that a provider like Salon.com produces on a daily basis. But that takes judgment, intelligence, and person power - all of which can easily fall victim to the deadening forces of mediocrity (and 'consolidation') that hovers ceaselessly over journalistic enterprise and enterprises.\" On the web, no content-originator is an island. As the aggregators and web-loggers have learned, users rarely want to stay at one site if the article they want is on another. If your site does not help lead them to it, they will find less reason to visit your site next time - even a well-resourced, quality editorial site as produced by traditional newspapers.

      "body": "<p>The BBC kicked off an urgent debate about the future of BBC1 and BBC2 last week, which could dwarf the fuss over Match of the Day. Director of television Mark Thompson - the brainy young Turk once rash enough to kill off One Man and His Dog - has gone public with Greg Dyke's approval, floating the idea of saying goodbye to \"mixed schedules\". Dyke's regime would phase out BBC1 as we know it, and reconfigure it as a populist entertainment network more in tune with the digital times, a family of channels - BBC1, 2, 3 and 4 - rather along the lines of BBC Radio. First changes are pencilled in for late 2001. </p> <p>Since Dyke took over in February and produced a manifesto called One BBC, envisaging happy teams of producers working in a creative powerhouse, the headlines have been grabbed by his plans to cut bureaucrats and potted plants as he introduced departments constructed as petals in a daisy. But alongside the cuts now being finalised, the more exciting part of the Dyke strategy has been overlooked: working out how to crank up the machine so that in two or three years' time the BBC has acquired the programmes to fit the changed channels while discarding John Birt's technologically driven legacy - two bungled digital networks, BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge, and the unloved News 24. </p> <p>\"The focus now is on programmes and audiences, really that's all the BBC is about, not mobile phones,\" says a key architect of the re-think. And the shift has meant talking in public about the unthinkable. How programmes are organised in schedules in an era when the electronic programme guide is king and the Tivo box, allowing you to personalise schedules, makes advances into homes. </p> <p>The Reithian belief that the BBC is there to inform, educate and entertain - counting on viewers, seen as passive, stumbling into an uplifting arts programme after watching a sitcom - has meant that BBC1 currently offers 14 different programme genres within its schedule, including religion, music and current affairs. Thompson is the first to say publicly that he doubts that this lofty ideal will still make sense when digital households eventually become the majority. </p> <p>His speech sounded the death knell of that traditional public service device of \"hammocking\". Putting a serious current affairs programme between a top drama and comedy no longer works. People simply zap away. A documentary or a Panorama on BBC1 will attract a BBC2-sized audience. </p> <p>At the very least, Thompson is clear that all BBC services, above all BBC1, have to become more predictable in the short to medium term (up to five years), using \"zones\" grouping the same kind of programmes together. So BBC1 will begin replacing documentaries - and probably Panorama and Omnibus - with top-class drama and entertainment. In fact, drama production is going up by as much as 40% in the coming year. BBC2 will be the home for serious documentaries, but will still incubate new comedy series, such as The Royle Family and Coupling, for the next few years. </p> <p>\"It's either an incredibly bold move or terribly wrong,\" says one executive - a not untypical reaction in a BBC where many remain gobsmacked doubters. But the speech is all part of a calculated process. Thompson flew to a remote television festival in Banff, Canada to deliver it. What he said was being minutely checked by Dyke until just before he spoke. Insiders know Thompson is the warm-up act for Dyke's MacTaggart Lecture at August's Guardian International Edinburgh Television Festival. </p> <p>The proposals for reorganising the BBC's TV services into an integrated family of channels will then be put up for consultation in the autumn. The plans were discussed with the governors last month. But it's highly significant that the first public airing of the new strategy has come from Thompson - the most pukka of \"old\" BBC figures, widely seen as Dyke's likely heir. \"If Greg had said it, he'd be accused of being Roland Rat getting his oar in,\" explains an insider. </p> <p>Singling out John Tusa - former head of the World Service, now boss of the Barbican - the Oxford-educated Thompson also raised eyebrows by taking on Britain's cultural elite, dubbing them \"just one more niche\" not necessarily in touch with the wider public. He said that live broadcasts of classical music, including eventually most Proms concerts, might perhaps be best suited to a separate arts and ideas cultural channel. </p> <p>Reaction so far is pretty divided. All the rival terrestrial networks sat up smartly. The rethink has great relevance to ITV, still fighting a battle with the regulator over news. Its director of programmes, David Liddiment, remains committed to a mixed, diverse schedule. Dawn Airey, Channel 5's director of programmes, said: \"It sounds like a good idea. I'm not surprised. It's logical.\" </p> <p>Inside the BBC, the speed of change stunned many outside the very top echelon. \"I've never seen a change-around occur so quickly,\" said one respected figure. A senior BBC broadcaster said: \"I find it deeply worrying. It's a different tone completely from what was being said even a year ago.\" As recently as November, ratifying the Alan Yentob-headed review of the channel, the BBC governors declared that BBC1 should offer the \"broadest range and richest genre mix\" of any British \"broad-appeal\" network. </p> <p>Politicians have yet to formulate detailed responses, but the BBC will clearly have a fight on its hands. Gerald Kaufman's sceptical culture, media and sports select committee will tackle it when the BBC's chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, goes to a hearing next month. At the Department of Culture, culture secretary Chris Smith's office expressed surprise, and repeated his belief in the value of a mixed schedule for BBC1. </p> <p>It seems that the BBC, in a preemptive strike, is redefining its public service broadcasting offering before legislation which might introduce stricter controls. Awkwardly, this is happening at a time when key areas, such as news and current affairs, are, as one executive says, \"in a totally prone position\", run by managers not confident in their jobs. </p> <p>But the move is also driven by fear: research into viewing in digital homes shows startling declines in BBC ratings. For example, in multi-channel homes in Wales audiences for the Six O'Clock News and the Nine O'Clock News have fallen by more than 40%. Men and children are heading straight for the genre selections on the EPG, ignoring channel schedules. \"Nickelodeon is the first thing children come across [on the EPG], Blue Peter isn't even up there,\" gasped one department head after a recent BBC briefing. </p> <p>Will Wyatt - until December Birt's deputy as BBC Broadcast chief executive - says the new approach makes sense. \"This is what the BBC will need to become at some stage.

But there's a big flaw in that system. Commissioners have got to deliver a substantial chunk of work to their own producers. So they are not neutral. They know the BBC's task is to build up in-house production. </p> <p>Why the delay in sorting things out? Why so many unfilled top jobs? Because the new system puts Dyke and Thompson at the centre. Their judgments are the ones that count.

      "body": "<p> The barrack-room lawyers of the television industry (there's no shortage of them) have three days to get their ideas in to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on communications reform. A single regulator is virtually a given. So too is the BBC being subject to the new authority - the governors, although a perfectly good board of management, are no longer credible regulators. </p> <p>A white paper has been promised for the autumn, though I suspect its appearance before Christmas is no more likely than Jerry Springer getting the Order of Merit. It is indeed a complex task. But please, please DCMS, put forward some firm proposals. The July 1998 green paper merely tabled a long list of questions. The government now needs to move on from its consultation culture. Technology is changing our industry at a punishing pace. The white paper has to grasp some nettles firmly and come up with radical approaches. Here are a few thoughts: </p> <p>\u0095 Nettle one: ITV's regional remit. It makes perfect sense to allow the creation of a single ITV company covering the whole of England. But it is increasingly paradoxical for one company to supply the premier entertainment channel while purporting to be a producer of regional programmes. </p> <p>ITV's current offerings are crudely divided between areas defined by nothing more sophisticated than where the transmitters happened to be in 1953. Digital technology offers infinite possibilities. But genuinely local television remains a pipe dream. </p> <p>In return for the privilege of the national entertainment channel, ITV should be asked to support the new restrictive service licences being issued. ITV should give them promotional time and sell advertising for them (as it used to for Channel 4). Without this, the licences will struggle and Britain will never have local television with which real communities can identify. </p> <p>\u0095 Nettle two: Channel 4's status. Channel 4's info-warriors are winning the argument against privatisation. It would serve little purpose and would reduce the amount of money it invests in programming. But Channel 4 needs a new remit. It should not be based on \"innovative programmes\" per se. This is a typically unenforceable requirement vulnerable to the subjective whims of regulators. </p> <p>Channel 4's role should be redefined as an incubator fund for the creative economy. One senior member of the channel described it to me as being UK television's equivalent of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But Channel 4 will need to be protected by fair-trading rules to allow it to run digital channels and online services at a loss while building their capital value. There should also be a policy for eventually realising that capital value. </p> <p>\u0095 Nettle three: BBC commercial activities. I have argued before in this column for BBC Worldwide to be privatised and for the BBC to set up an intellectual property licensing division. For the first time, the BBC's assets would be properly valued in the marketplace and fair-trading arguments silenced. </p> <p>The BBC should also be able to take minority equity stakes in businesses built on its intellectual property. In this way, a clear line would be drawn between activities funded by the licence fee and commercial ones. It would also give scope to Greg Dyke's entrepreneurial ideas. </p> <p>And as a twist to the \"mutuality\" debate, why not return some of the proceeds directly to licence fee payers? This could be the elusive driver for digital take-up. The dividend would be paid to those viewers who had subscribed to a digital service and held in trust for the rest. </p> <p>\u0095 Nettle four: electronic programme guides (EPGs). The means of entry to the digital world must be truly flexible. Our creative economy will grow if we are all given the maximum opportunity to consume as many goods and services as possible. Whether via an ADSL service, a cable supplier, a satellite company or a terrestrial company, we should be able to gain access to material with maximum freedom. The existing EPGs are clunky, mostly channel-based and, at their worst, anti-competitive. </p> <p>\u0095 Nettle five: content supply. \"Content\" covers everything from conventional television programmes to online data. To have a healthy creative economy, Britain needs a truly competitive content market. </p> <p>Television has never had one because the distributors (the broadcasters) control access to the audience and fund nearly all the content. Meanwhile, Oftel is forcing BT to open up its networks to a range of providers. The white paper should affirm this principle so content suppliers have access to all the distribution platforms. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Bazalgette is creative director of GMG Endermol Entertainment, an independent production company part-owned by the Guardian Media Group</p>",

Here are a few thoughts: \u0095 Nettle one: ITV's regional remit. It makes perfect sense to allow the creation of a single ITV company covering the whole of England. But it is increasingly paradoxical for one company to supply the premier entertainment channel while purporting to be a producer of regional programmes. ITV's current offerings are crudely divided between areas defined by nothing more sophisticated than where the transmitters happened to be in 1953. Digital technology offers infinite possibilities. But genuinely local television remains a pipe dream. In return for the privilege of the national entertainment channel, ITV should be asked to support the new restrictive service licences being issued. ITV should give them promotional time and sell advertising for them (as it used to for Channel 4). Without this, the licences will struggle and Britain will never have local television with which real communities can identify. \u0095 Nettle two: Channel 4's status. Channel 4's info-warriors are winning the argument against privatisation. It would serve little purpose and would reduce the amount of money it invests in programming. But Channel 4 needs a new remit. It should not be based on \"innovative programmes\" per se. This is a typically unenforceable requirement vulnerable to the subjective whims of regulators. Channel 4's role should be redefined as an incubator fund for the creative economy. One senior member of the channel described it to me as being UK television's equivalent of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But Channel 4 will need to be protected by fair-trading rules to allow it to run digital channels and online services at a loss while building their capital value. There should also be a policy for eventually realising that capital value. \u0095 Nettle three: BBC commercial activities. I have argued before in this column for BBC Worldwide to be privatised and for the BBC to set up an intellectual property licensing division. For the first time, the BBC's assets would be properly valued in the marketplace and fair-trading arguments silenced. The BBC should also be able to take minority equity stakes in businesses built on its intellectual property. In this way, a clear line would be drawn between activities funded by the licence fee and commercial ones. It would also give scope to Greg Dyke's entrepreneurial ideas. And as a twist to the \"mutuality\" debate, why not return some of the proceeds directly to licence fee payers? This could be the elusive driver for digital take-up. The dividend would be paid to those viewers who had subscribed to a digital service and held in trust for the rest. \u0095 Nettle four: electronic programme guides (EPGs). The means of entry to the digital world must be truly flexible. Our creative economy will grow if we are all given the maximum opportunity to consume as many goods and services as possible. Whether via an ADSL service, a cable supplier, a satellite company or a terrestrial company, we should be able to gain access to material with maximum freedom. The existing EPGs are clunky, mostly channel-based and, at their worst, anti-competitive. \u0095 Nettle five: content supply. \"Content\" covers everything from conventional television programmes to online data. To have a healthy creative economy, Britain needs a truly competitive content market. Television has never had one because the distributors (the broadcasters) control access to the audience and fund nearly all the content. Meanwhile, Oftel is forcing BT to open up its networks to a range of providers. The white paper should affirm this principle so content suppliers have access to all the distribution platforms. \u0095 Peter Bazalgette is creative director of GMG Endermol Entertainment, an independent production company part-owned by the Guardian Media Group",

We also happen to agree on the fundamental point about the role of the press in political life. We both regard editors and journalists - whether working directly to their owners' agenda or to their own - as society's prime spin doctors. </p> <p>Where we have tended to disagree is over how to combat this fact of media life. From the moment he became Tony Blair's press secretary, he adopted a strategy about which I have long been sceptical. Not least because it is, in some ways, at odds with his combative personality and takes little account of his fiercely partisan viewpoint. </p> <p>Before the election, I understood the benefits that would accrue from wooing the Sun and neutralising the Tory bias of other titles. But, given the treatment they had handed out to John Major in his final years in office, I didn't expect them to endorse the Conservatives anyway. </p> <p>Once Blair became prime minister he enjoyed a lengthy honeymoon, though there were early hiccups (the Ecclestone affair, the Cook marriage saga) which suggested that the antagonistic relationship between press and government would eventually kick in once more. </p> <p>Within months, the central line of newspaper attack emerged: the target was to be Campbell himself. Spin must be turned into a sin. The supposed strength of the Blair government, its presentation, was to be transformed into its weakness. </p> <p>Beaverbrook - echoing Hitler, incidentally - was fond of telling his editors: \"Repetition is the key to propaganda.\" Indeed it is. </p> <p>\"The drip-drip-drip of poison\", to borrow Peter Mandelson's apt description of the process, soon became a daily phenomenon. \"Spin-doctor\" became a term of abuse. Spinners were \"exposed\" as dabblers in the \"black arts\". Readers were encouraged to see Campbell and his ilk as a sinister group. </p> <p>A Guardian library check of computer records for 10 national papers over the past three years shows that \"spin\" has appeared in more than 2,500 headlines, let alone stories. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Blair was cast as a hostage to the \"art of spin\". His government's policy statements and ministerial speeches were reported not in terms of their content but with a nod towards what we might call the mechanics behind them. Why and how they came about was considered more important than the fact of their existence. </p> <p>Naturally, a Tory party in disarray, with a new, untried leader finding his way, latched on quickly to the press agenda. The cries of \"spin\" in the Commons became as regular as those in the papers. </p> <p>It didn't take long for the simplistic single-syllable word to take hold of the public imagination. Blair had become synonymous with spin. Ask a random selection of people now what they think of the government and, whether they support it or not, most are sure to mention spin in a pejorative way. </p> <p>I wasn't in the least surprised by the revelation in the leaked memo written by Blair's private pollster, Philip Gould, that the prime minister is widely considered to be \"all spin and presentation\". </p> <p>But I was astonished that it has taken Gould so long to discover it. What use are these focus groups if they are so slow to catch on? A surprising number of people I bump into even know who Campbell is. </p> <p>The man in the background has taken centre stage, not because he has sought it but because newspapers have thrust him into the limelight. Part of the reason for this is undoubtedly Campbell's relationship with the journalists he meets every day. They resent his power, dislike his sarcasm and, on many occasions, have been intimidated by his rage. </p> <p>Even those papers sympathetic to Labour have been upset by the tactics he employs. Why does he feed stories to the true-blue Daily Mail rather than the red-tinged Daily Express? </p> <p>Why should the Sun, which remains as reactionary as ever, be treated sweetly, while the Mirror is too often left to swing in the wind (and get so angry it even dared to urge readers to vote Tory in the London mayoral election)? </p> <p>If the Campbell approach made sense two years ago, it surely doesn't any longer. The press has resolutely set its face against Blair - and no amount of spin doctoring will make much difference now. </p> <p>I kept a record of political coverage in the four most popular daily papers (Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror and Daily Express) from May 29 until Friday. Over those 17 days, the headlines and stories were overwhelmingly negative, in spite of the fact that three of those titles are supposed to be supporting Blair. </p> <p>The Daily Mail, as one might expect, has been relentless in its criticism. It also devotes more space to politics than the other three put together. Several pages in most issues are dominated by heavily angled \"news\" stories pouring scorn on Blair. </p> <p>On most days there were three page leads critical of Labour. On May 31, for example, the sequence of headlines ran: \"60,000 have deserted New Labour\" (page 2); \"Labour reels as a million vote to keep clause 28\" (page 6); \"This archaic class war on middle England\" (above an attack on John Prescott on pages 18 and 19); \"'Shame' of Robin Cook\" (over an article on Sierra Leone on page 26); and \"Blair ignores calls to cull army of spin doctors\" (page 29). </p> <p>Next day, the Mail splashed on \"Fiasco of Labour's health service survey\", and its page 2 was headlined \"Labour 'has become paranoid under Blair'\". This story wasn't carried by any other paper - which isn't too surprising, since it was based on the views of a wife of a former junior minister writing in Tribune. </p> <p>When the story of Baroness Jay's schooling broke, the Mail splashed on it. The following day it was the subject of a leader and of comment by two columnists, with all three pieces making the same point. </p> <p>By the end of that week, when Blair made his speech to the Women's Institute conference, the paper was in its element, with headlines about \"humiliation\", \"Blair's Waterloo\" and \"Wembley backlash.\" Significantly, its main leading article was about \"the perils of spin\". </p> <p>But what of the Blair-friendly Sun? Here are a selection of its headlines over the period: \"You've lost touch, Tony\"; \"2 Jags, 9 baths and a butler\" (about the refit of Prescott's grace-and-favour residence); \"Blair's thrown it all away\"; and \"Labour council tax shake-up could put bills up 25%\". </p> <p>Sun columnist Richard Littlejohn never lets a chance of hammering Blair pass him by. The paper carried an article assaulting Blair's policies by Tony Benn. A variety of stories about the euro were explicit attacks on Blair and chancellor Brown. Leading arti cles, which, admittedly, few Sun readers bother with, contained innumerable gripes about the government. </p> <p>OK, then, what about the Mirror? There was certainly more sympathy for Blair in its leaders, and it did its best to counter the WI fiasco by revealing the eccentric views of one of the hecklers. It was also harsh on William Hague. </p> <p>But some headlines were strangely reminiscent of the Sun. One - \"You've lost touch, Tony\" - was exactly the same. Among others were \"Labour fudges fox hunt vote\", \"Derry's \u00a3150,000 Dorchester bash\" and \"Jack's open door\" (to asylum seekers). </p> <p>Also notable was the casual abuse of government figures in other columns by Paul Routledge and even by Sue Carroll, who referred to Baroness Jay as a pompous peer. She may well be right. The point is that, along with stories about splits on the euro, the overall picture painted of Blair in the Mirror is little different from that in other papers. </p> <p>The Daily Express seemed to be in two minds. Its famed right-wing columnist Peter Hitchens apart, there were plenty of anti-government headlines - \"Ageist Labour has forgotten elderly\", \"How we were betrayed by Brown\", \"Prescott blunder...\", \"Blair gimmicks won't cure the ills of the NHS\" and many more. </p> <p>Does anyone believe that this litany of loathing for the government is the result of successful spin-doctoring by Campbell? What it illustrates instead is the failure of spin, that the papers have reverted to type, that the press cannot be beaten into obeisance by the kind of public relations initiatives adopted by Campbell and his team. </p> <p>These four papers are together read by about 25m Britons every day. They have gradually built up in the minds of their readers the idea that Blair is a man of no substance who has not fulfilled his promises.

      "byline": "Matt Wells",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For some journalists, career highs might include penetrating a remote war zone, interviewing a world leader or unveiling a major scientific breakthrough. But given the opportunity, most of those hacks - this one included - would happily swap their battered pocket notebooks for an access-all-areas pass at a Madonna gig. Yet for some reason, Matthew Wright wants to hang up his tiara. </p> <p>\"There's only a certain amount of time you can do this sort of thing for before it starts to take a toll on you,\" says Wright, whose last column in the Mirror will appear tomorrow. It seems that the relentless round of showbiz parties, press launches and daily deadlines has taken its toll on Wright, who at 35 is taking the dot.com plunge and joining an entertainment website aimed at teenage girls. </p> <p>So no more cheesy polaroids of Matthew with Maddy, Matthew with Barrymore, and Matthew with Hugh and Liz; no more tales of the size of Robbie Williams's manhood. It's the end of an era. How will we cope with life without Matthew? And more to the point, how will Matthew cope with life without us? </p> <p>For he is the archetypal showbiz hack. The cheeky grin, flirtatious blue eyes and slightly camp manner (he's married, before you ask) cover a steely determination to be the best at his job, to get the top stories, the biggest exclusives. And, it seems, a genuine understanding of the nature of celebrity. \"What I have learned is that they might be extremely rich and extremely famous but, apart from the fact that certain aspects of their lives have been changed by their status, they are still essentially human and normal. If you can talk to a celebrity like they are a normal person, you'll get a normal conversation back.\" </p> <p>Wright's rise as a showbiz hack has been harder than most. When he started at the Mirror a little more than four years ago, he was a bit of a nobody. He had worked for his current boss Piers Morgan at the Sun, when Morgan was editor of the Bizarre column, followed by a spell on the Richard Littlejohn show at Sky. But he was far from being a household name. </p> <p>Joining the Mirror wasn't much help either - most of the PR circuit which controls the flow of stories from the big-name celebrities was firmly plugged in to News International. If you didn't work for the Sun, your name wasn't on the list. So there was only one way to get noticed: shout very loudly. \"I started very aggressively, the idea being that the only way we would win the battle against other long-established columns would be to go and make ourselves unforgettable, poke fun at them and tease celebrities quite mercilessly. And it worked - we started to get recognised as a newspaper column and as a face in our own right.\" </p> <p>The relentless pursuit of celebrity became Wright's stock-in-trade. While other columns depended upon the drip-feed from public relations teams, Wright battled from outside. And while the strategy was hard work, it was also immense fun. \"In the early days I was just viciously cruel about people.\" </p> <p>Cruel is not the word. There was the singer Darren Day: \"We pursued him for his inability to remain faithful to people for more than about 10 minutes.\" </p> <p>And the EastEnders star Sid Owen: \"I think Sid suffered from Darren Day-itis - the same inability to remain faithful. He threw a pint of beer over me - I think that was about us saying what a useless piece of pondlife he was.\" </p> <p>Then there was Robbie \"Hamster\" Williams: \"That was about the size of his manhood, which was the result of some pictures we were offered but didn't buy.\" </p> <p>And the Spice Girls: \"I stand by all of what I said about them. I'm amazed that it became the phenomenon that it did, because I don't consider them to be a particularly talented bunch of women. The 'girl power' thing irritated me - everybody I could see around them was a man. The songwriters were men, their manager was a man, their record company people were men.\" </p> <p>There comes a time, though, when some of these people have to be confronted. So how did Day feel about all his ex-girlfriends spilling the beans about what a rat he was? \"He was very pleasant about it, and held his hand up and we went out for lunch.\" </p> <p>Robbie Williams? \"I had to apologise in the paper, which was quite tongue-in-cheek. It was just before the Brit Awards, when he had been nominated in every category. There didn't seem to be much point in continuing to say he was a useless no-hoper, because obviously the public loved him. And, God bless him, he was really sweet about it. I saw him about a month later and we shook hands - it was the handshake that meant more to pop fans than the one between Gorbachev and Reagan. It had a high-camp, send-up feel to it. </p> <p>\"Again I was very impressed by his personality, that he could forgive what was a fairly relentless campaign of mickey-taking against him. Every time I see him it's all very civilised. I wonder whether, if the roles had been reversed, I would have forgiven and forgotten. I'm not sure I would have done. I would probably have had a swing at me like Sid Owen tried to.\" </p> <p>But the Mirror column was not just about send-ups: celebrities were not the only ones to set up publicity-seeking stunts. Wright once presented a baby's sleepsuit to Madonna, shortly after she had become a mother, at a press conference for Evita. \"I was shaking like a leaf, I was so nervous - I walked down to the front, said 'Hello Maddy, I've bought you this' - and she said: 'I don't think it'll fit me.' Adrenalin took over and it was high camp all the way.\" </p> <p>Then there was the time when he sneaked in with a false beard to a Smash Hits poll-winners party after being banned following the Spice Girls feud, and hid in a toilet before barging down to the front when the group came on stage: \"I jumped up onto the orchestra pit and unfurled a Mirror banner. Geri Halliwell said 'There's Matthew Wright!' and all of a sudden the BBC cameras got this Mirror banner and a silly man in a beard. It's a huge buzz. I was literally shaking like a leaf, as much with the humiliation of it as anything else. I'm no tough guy, but I've no shame. . .\" </p> <p>Clearly not. But if the party was such fun, why wimp out now? Why is a man at the top of his profession, on the second-biggest daily newspaper in the country, taking the plunge in uncharted waters? \"Lots of things really, lots of things coming together at the same time in my life. I've done 10 years in Fleet Street, I'm almost 35 and I looked around and asked myself what other jobs would I like to do on Fleet Street. There's only a certain amount of time you can do this or you just lose interest in it and become not so good at it. Four years is just about the right time, I think.\" </p> <p>Wright is passionate about the new venture - <a href=\"http://www.mykindaplace.com\">mykindaplace.com </a> - and while he is aware of the risks, he believes there is a market to be exploited. \"The research shows that teenage girls were heavily and increasingly reliant on the internet. That was the direction that age group was going. It just seemed like the obvious thing to do.\" (And if the website fails, there's always the book he's writing, and \"other projects\".) </p> <p>Wright has been brought in to oversee the editorial direction of the new website, which will be the usual teen mix of showbiz and lifestyle features. He will take charge of a team of journalists, mostly recruited from monthly magazines, and bring them up to speed with the disciplines of daily deadlines - it is anticipated that about 60% of the site will be updated daily. </p> <p>It is a risky venture for Wright. It is not going to be easy to persuade stars who see the tabloid press as the best vehicle to push their personalities to come around to the web way of thinking.

      "bodyText": "For some journalists, career highs might include penetrating a remote war zone, interviewing a world leader or unveiling a major scientific breakthrough. But given the opportunity, most of those hacks - this one included - would happily swap their battered pocket notebooks for an access-all-areas pass at a Madonna gig. Yet for some reason, Matthew Wright wants to hang up his tiara. \"There's only a certain amount of time you can do this sort of thing for before it starts to take a toll on you,\" says Wright, whose last column in the Mirror will appear tomorrow. It seems that the relentless round of showbiz parties, press launches and daily deadlines has taken its toll on Wright, who at 35 is taking the dot.com plunge and joining an entertainment website aimed at teenage girls. So no more cheesy polaroids of Matthew with Maddy, Matthew with Barrymore, and Matthew with Hugh and Liz; no more tales of the size of Robbie Williams's manhood. It's the end of an era. How will we cope with life without Matthew? And more to the point, how will Matthew cope with life without us? For he is the archetypal showbiz hack. The cheeky grin, flirtatious blue eyes and slightly camp manner (he's married, before you ask) cover a steely determination to be the best at his job, to get the top stories, the biggest exclusives. And, it seems, a genuine understanding of the nature of celebrity. \"What I have learned is that they might be extremely rich and extremely famous but, apart from the fact that certain aspects of their lives have been changed by their status, they are still essentially human and normal. If you can talk to a celebrity like they are a normal person, you'll get a normal conversation back.\" Wright's rise as a showbiz hack has been harder than most. When he started at the Mirror a little more than four years ago, he was a bit of a nobody. He had worked for his current boss Piers Morgan at the Sun, when Morgan was editor of the Bizarre column, followed by a spell on the Richard Littlejohn show at Sky. But he was far from being a household name. Joining the Mirror wasn't much help either - most of the PR circuit which controls the flow of stories from the big-name celebrities was firmly plugged in to News International. If you didn't work for the Sun, your name wasn't on the list. So there was only one way to get noticed: shout very loudly. \"I started very aggressively, the idea being that the only way we would win the battle against other long-established columns would be to go and make ourselves unforgettable, poke fun at them and tease celebrities quite mercilessly. And it worked - we started to get recognised as a newspaper column and as a face in our own right.\" The relentless pursuit of celebrity became Wright's stock-in-trade. While other columns depended upon the drip-feed from public relations teams, Wright battled from outside. And while the strategy was hard work, it was also immense fun. \"In the early days I was just viciously cruel about people.\" Cruel is not the word. There was the singer Darren Day: \"We pursued him for his inability to remain faithful to people for more than about 10 minutes.\" And the EastEnders star Sid Owen: \"I think Sid suffered from Darren Day-itis - the same inability to remain faithful. He threw a pint of beer over me - I think that was about us saying what a useless piece of pondlife he was.\" Then there was Robbie \"Hamster\" Williams: \"That was about the size of his manhood, which was the result of some pictures we were offered but didn't buy.\" And the Spice Girls: \"I stand by all of what I said about them. I'm amazed that it became the phenomenon that it did, because I don't consider them to be a particularly talented bunch of women. The 'girl power' thing irritated me - everybody I could see around them was a man. The songwriters were men, their manager was a man, their record company people were men.\" There comes a time, though, when some of these people have to be confronted. So how did Day feel about all his ex-girlfriends spilling the beans about what a rat he was? \"He was very pleasant about it, and held his hand up and we went out for lunch.\" Robbie Williams? \"I had to apologise in the paper, which was quite tongue-in-cheek. It was just before the Brit Awards, when he had been nominated in every category. There didn't seem to be much point in continuing to say he was a useless no-hoper, because obviously the public loved him. And, God bless him, he was really sweet about it. I saw him about a month later and we shook hands - it was the handshake that meant more to pop fans than the one between Gorbachev and Reagan. It had a high-camp, send-up feel to it. \"Again I was very impressed by his personality, that he could forgive what was a fairly relentless campaign of mickey-taking against him. Every time I see him it's all very civilised. I wonder whether, if the roles had been reversed, I would have forgiven and forgotten. I'm not sure I would have done. I would probably have had a swing at me like Sid Owen tried to.\" But the Mirror column was not just about send-ups: celebrities were not the only ones to set up publicity-seeking stunts. Wright once presented a baby's sleepsuit to Madonna, shortly after she had become a mother, at a press conference for Evita. \"I was shaking like a leaf, I was so nervous - I walked down to the front, said 'Hello Maddy, I've bought you this' - and she said: 'I don't think it'll fit me.' Adrenalin took over and it was high camp all the way.\" Then there was the time when he sneaked in with a false beard to a Smash Hits poll-winners party after being banned following the Spice Girls feud, and hid in a toilet before barging down to the front when the group came on stage: \"I jumped up onto the orchestra pit and unfurled a Mirror banner. Geri Halliwell said 'There's Matthew Wright!' and all of a sudden the BBC cameras got this Mirror banner and a silly man in a beard. It's a huge buzz. I was literally shaking like a leaf, as much with the humiliation of it as anything else. I'm no tough guy, but I've no shame. . .\" Clearly not. But if the party was such fun, why wimp out now? Why is a man at the top of his profession, on the second-biggest daily newspaper in the country, taking the plunge in uncharted waters? \"Lots of things really, lots of things coming together at the same time in my life. I've done 10 years in Fleet Street, I'm almost 35 and I looked around and asked myself what other jobs would I like to do on Fleet Street. There's only a certain amount of time you can do this or you just lose interest in it and become not so good at it. Four years is just about the right time, I think.\" Wright is passionate about the new venture - mykindaplace.com - and while he is aware of the risks, he believes there is a market to be exploited. \"The research shows that teenage girls were heavily and increasingly reliant on the internet. That was the direction that age group was going. It just seemed like the obvious thing to do.\" (And if the website fails, there's always the book he's writing, and \"other projects\".) Wright has been brought in to oversee the editorial direction of the new website, which will be the usual teen mix of showbiz and lifestyle features. He will take charge of a team of journalists, mostly recruited from monthly magazines, and bring them up to speed with the disciplines of daily deadlines - it is anticipated that about 60% of the site will be updated daily. It is a risky venture for Wright. It is not going to be easy to persuade stars who see the tabloid press as the best vehicle to push their personalities to come around to the web way of thinking. And he doesn't believe that his name will help. \"It's easy to assume that because you have a high-profile job on a successful newspaper that automatically opens doors for you. But from the start, when I was working with Piers here, it was very obvious that the PR strategy was single-minded and pointed towards Wapping. We decided that the best way to do it was independently of the PRs - to go out and self-generate, and that's what we've done for the past four and a half years. It's something that I'm used to doing, starting from scratch.\" The timing, too, is questionable: mykindaplace launches just as some high-profile content-heavy sites are just discovering that their revenue doesn't begin to justify their overheads. \"I don't see that fear as pertinent to what we're doing. One of the most reassuring figures I've seen was that the teen magazine market is rapidly falling apart in terms of circulation, and I can't think of any other reason for that other than teenage girls are diversifying their interests.

      "body": "<p>The moment the Premier League decided, ill advisedly, to ask for sealed bids for the next round of television rights to broadcast top football, the die was cast. Far from the \u00a32bn over three years promised in the incessant leaks to the national press in recent months, the 20 Premier League clubs will share just \u00a31.6bn, barely above the most conservative of market expectations. </p> <p>And talk about prune juice! Just how long would you expect the \u00a31.6bn to stay with the clubs? Do I hear \u00a315m to win the transfer rights to the next \"big thing\" from continental Europe? </p> <p>Worse, BSkyB, the holders of the core pay-TV rights to top football since 1992, was expected to pay up big time, and did not. How much did Sky bid? A former senior Sky executive, asked to speculate as to the outcome, believed that the rights to the pay-TV live window would go for \u00a31.7bn. When told the actual figure, he was astonished. \"They [the Premier League] have given it away!\" he said. </p> <p>BSkyB, the winner of the key live rights to 66 matches, saw its shares soar by nearly 15% over two days, first on speculation that it would have to spend just \u00a31.1bn over three years, a far cry from the Premier League's hopeful expectations, and then on the confirmation that, indeed, that is precisely what BSkyB would be paying for the biggest prize in UK sport. Yet again, Sky had got it right. </p> <p>What went wrong? A mix of misplaced greed, bad external advice, complicated bidding rules and an overly sensitive board of Premier League chairmen worried about the potential for regulatory intervention combined to provide the biggest disappointment in sports rights since the bad old days of ITV-BBC duopoly control of major sport. </p> <p>The bid for the renewal of Premier League rights was meant to be mega - fuelled by the value of content in the new media age. Football, everybody knows, drove the take-up of dishes and cable connections in the 1990s, and helped make multi-channel television a success. And there is no doubt that football is increasingly valuable. </p> <p>In 1992, BSkyB bid \u00a3304m for five years' worth of live TV rights. \"They will lose their shirts\", thought one Greg Dyke, now director-general of the BBC and then on the losing side of the bidding war for top football at ITV. By 1996, the stakes had risen. Sky had to bid an amazing \u00a3670m, payable over four years, to secure an extension to its pay-TV rights, seeing off Carlton, Mirror Group and United News &amp; Media. </p> <p>This time, with the prospect of multiple platform revenues (enhanced TV, mobile, digital subscriber line, and the rest), the expectation was for a major uplift in the money flowing to top football. The auction attracted various bids from the great and good of British media: Sky, of course, and NTL, naturally. But also digital terrestrial broadcaster ONdigital (owned by Granada and Carlton), Telewest, Pearson, the BBC and ITV. An uplift there certainly was, but nothing like on the scale that the League chairmen had hoped. </p> <p>The process looked flawed as soon as it was announced. The league chairmen decided to entertain sealed bids for each of three categories of rights - live, pay-per-view (PPV) and highlights. It was further decided that no single broadcaster would be allowed to win more than one category of rights. From the start, this created a problem. </p> <p>The only reason to bid high for any content is to secure exclusivity. There is no point paying a premium for content if others can have access along with you, and so devalue your proposition. A bit of free advice for the Premier League on these matters: one, you always make more money if you put an exclusive offer on the table; two, you always make more money if you allow bidders to come back a second time; three, you always make more money if you hire advisers who understand points one and two. </p> <p>There are reasons why the league and its advisers behaved the way they did. For a start, both ONdigital and NTL threatened to go to the regulators (here and in Brussels) in the event that BSkyB was able to extend its dominance of televised sport. As a consequence, the league wanted the process to be as fair, and as transparent, as possible. </p> <p>At the same time, a string of media companies, including BSkyB and NTL, had been busy taking stakes in Premier League clubs, and there was a concern that undue pressure might be brought to bear on the bidding process. Better, therefore, to seal the bids. </p> <p>It all played into BSkyB's hands. Sky was never going to bid over the odds, knowing, as it did, that only the dominant Premier League broadcaster (Sky, itself, of course) had already spent the money to create studios, hire staff, and develop a brand to bring top football to the nation. Any new entrant would start well back from the starting line. </p> <p>More to the point, why pay huge amounts for the live rights, if someone else would get the pay-per-view matches, and possibly cannibalise your market? If PPV proved popular, wasn't there a chance that Sky Sports subscribers would simply cancel their accounts, knowing they could watch the odd match on PPV? </p> <p>The approach of dividing up the rights gave Sky an edge, because it knew that no one else could steal all the matches on offer. The result? BSkyB low-balled the \"live\" rights, knowing that someone else - as it turns out cable company NTL - would get the PPV window. </p> <p>Sky knew, too, that satellite homes, inevitably, would be offered the PPV service. There are only two commercial rules about PPV. It is all about the number of potential customers, and the number of these who buy the service. No PPV operator would risk losing access to the 4m homes in the UK currently receiving their digital television via Sky dishes. A PPV operator needs as many potential customers as possible, since so few, traditionally, actually purchase. (We won't even speculate as to whether the parties actually held discussions about tactics before tabling their bids. Yes, it is true, executives from NTL were seen entering the forbidding doors of Sky's headquarters in Isleworth in recent weeks. Don't go there.) </p> <p>Perversely, the real loser here, other than the short-changed Premier League, is NTL (so any carve-up scenario looks distinctly ropey - unless, of course, you subscribe to the \"double cross\" school of history). The hapless cable operator, struggling to introduce a digital service when its rival Telewest is already well advanced, bid a whopping \u00a3328m in guaranteed revenues for pay-per- view football. This is a market that has no pedigree in this country. It is a market that requires the widest possible distribution. It is a market that would benefit hugely from cross-promotion from a terrestrial broadcaster. BSkyB got its 66 live games at a level at least 45% below the top expectation of \u00a32bn. NTL, by contrast, has paid \u00a3328m - upward of 30% over the odds (the top forecast for PPV was \u00a3300m) for an unproven market. </p> <p>Assuming NTL charges \u00a34.99 per match, for each of 40 matches a year, it has to persuade fully 6% of all multi-channel homes in the country to buy all the matches (or 12% to buy half the matches, or 24% to buy a quarter of the matches, etc.) to break even. On the basis of the US experience, this a tall order. I, for one, think they have over-paid. </p> <p>And what of the BBC? No more Match of the Day? Scandal! No Football League either? (That went to ITV and ONdigital, for a huge \u00a3315m). Atrocious! </p> <p>In fact, the BBC did precisely the right thing by letting ITV win the highlight rights and letting ITV and ONdigital pay over the odds for the Nationwide matches. The idea of paying \u00a3183m over three years for highlights and a share of \u00a3315m for Football League rights would never have been acceptable in the context of a BBC already worried about its sources of funding. This is a corporation aware of its tenuous position, as one director-general exits, and another takes his place. </p> <p>Talk about a rock and a hard place! Had the BBC beaten ITV, there would have been whingeing editorials in the better national newspapers about the profligacy of the stewards of public service television. (As it is, the BBC is instead pilloried for having lost yet another sport fixture.) Well done, BBC, for securing instead rights to the FA Cup matches. </p> <p>The Premier League and Nationwide rights arrangement is now set for another three years. Sky, yet again, is in the driving seat, and NTL has bitten off (probably) far more than it can chew. ITV is back into top league football. Does it all matter? Yes. </p> <p>The future of multi-channel TV is probably as much about home shopping, online information and computer games as it is about Coronation Street or EastEnders. About 20% of us are logging on to the internet every day. Another significant minority never watch network television. But whatever else you say, football still rules. OK. </p> <p>\u0095 Mathew Horsman is a media analyst at the City firm of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.

Sky had to bid an amazing \u00a3670m, payable over four years, to secure an extension to its pay-TV rights, seeing off Carlton, Mirror Group and United News &amp; Media. This time, with the prospect of multiple platform revenues (enhanced TV, mobile, digital subscriber line, and the rest), the expectation was for a major uplift in the money flowing to top football. The auction attracted various bids from the great and good of British media: Sky, of course, and NTL, naturally. But also digital terrestrial broadcaster ONdigital (owned by Granada and Carlton), Telewest, Pearson, the BBC and ITV. An uplift there certainly was, but nothing like on the scale that the League chairmen had hoped. The process looked flawed as soon as it was announced. The league chairmen decided to entertain sealed bids for each of three categories of rights - live, pay-per-view (PPV) and highlights. It was further decided that no single broadcaster would be allowed to win more than one category of rights. From the start, this created a problem. The only reason to bid high for any content is to secure exclusivity. There is no point paying a premium for content if others can have access along with you, and so devalue your proposition. A bit of free advice for the Premier League on these matters: one, you always make more money if you put an exclusive offer on the table; two, you always make more money if you allow bidders to come back a second time; three, you always make more money if you hire advisers who understand points one and two. There are reasons why the league and its advisers behaved the way they did. For a start, both ONdigital and NTL threatened to go to the regulators (here and in Brussels) in the event that BSkyB was able to extend its dominance of televised sport. As a consequence, the league wanted the process to be as fair, and as transparent, as possible. At the same time, a string of media companies, including BSkyB and NTL, had been busy taking stakes in Premier League clubs, and there was a concern that undue pressure might be brought to bear on the bidding process. Better, therefore, to seal the bids. It all played into BSkyB's hands. Sky was never going to bid over the odds, knowing, as it did, that only the dominant Premier League broadcaster (Sky, itself, of course) had already spent the money to create studios, hire staff, and develop a brand to bring top football to the nation. Any new entrant would start well back from the starting line. More to the point, why pay huge amounts for the live rights, if someone else would get the pay-per-view matches, and possibly cannibalise your market? If PPV proved popular, wasn't there a chance that Sky Sports subscribers would simply cancel their accounts, knowing they could watch the odd match on PPV? The approach of dividing up the rights gave Sky an edge, because it knew that no one else could steal all the matches on offer. The result? BSkyB low-balled the \"live\" rights, knowing that someone else - as it turns out cable company NTL - would get the PPV window. Sky knew, too, that satellite homes, inevitably, would be offered the PPV service. There are only two commercial rules about PPV. It is all about the number of potential customers, and the number of these who buy the service. No PPV operator would risk losing access to the 4m homes in the UK currently receiving their digital television via Sky dishes. A PPV operator needs as many potential customers as possible, since so few, traditionally, actually purchase. (We won't even speculate as to whether the parties actually held discussions about tactics before tabling their bids. Yes, it is true, executives from NTL were seen entering the forbidding doors of Sky's headquarters in Isleworth in recent weeks. Don't go there.) Perversely, the real loser here, other than the short-changed Premier League, is NTL (so any carve-up scenario looks distinctly ropey - unless, of course, you subscribe to the \"double cross\" school of history). The hapless cable operator, struggling to introduce a digital service when its rival Telewest is already well advanced, bid a whopping \u00a3328m in guaranteed revenues for pay-per- view football. This is a market that has no pedigree in this country. It is a market that requires the widest possible distribution. It is a market that would benefit hugely from cross-promotion from a terrestrial broadcaster. BSkyB got its 66 live games at a level at least 45% below the top expectation of \u00a32bn. NTL, by contrast, has paid \u00a3328m - upward of 30% over the odds (the top forecast for PPV was \u00a3300m) for an unproven market. Assuming NTL charges \u00a34.99 per match, for each of 40 matches a year, it has to persuade fully 6% of all multi-channel homes in the country to buy all the matches (or 12% to buy half the matches, or 24% to buy a quarter of the matches, etc.) to break even. On the basis of the US experience, this a tall order. I, for one, think they have over-paid. And what of the BBC? No more Match of the Day? Scandal! No Football League either? (That went to ITV and ONdigital, for a huge \u00a3315m). Atrocious! In fact, the BBC did precisely the right thing by letting ITV win the highlight rights and letting ITV and ONdigital pay over the odds for the Nationwide matches. The idea of paying \u00a3183m over three years for highlights and a share of \u00a3315m for Football League rights would never have been acceptable in the context of a BBC already worried about its sources of funding. This is a corporation aware of its tenuous position, as one director-general exits, and another takes his place. Talk about a rock and a hard place! Had the BBC beaten ITV, there would have been whingeing editorials in the better national newspapers about the profligacy of the stewards of public service television. (As it is, the BBC is instead pilloried for having lost yet another sport fixture.) Well done, BBC, for securing instead rights to the FA Cup matches. The Premier League and Nationwide rights arrangement is now set for another three years. Sky, yet again, is in the driving seat, and NTL has bitten off (probably) far more than it can chew. ITV is back into top league football. Does it all matter? Yes. The future of multi-channel TV is probably as much about home shopping, online information and computer games as it is about Coronation Street or EastEnders. About 20% of us are logging on to the internet every day. Another significant minority never watch network television. But whatever else you say, football still rules. OK. \u0095 Mathew Horsman is a media analyst at the City firm of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.

      "body": "<p>As Kevin Keegan said yesterday, it looked a simple finish. But when David Beckham's free-kick bounced near the German penalty spot and sat up in front of Alan Shearer, there was still work to be done. </p> <p>\"An inexperienced forward might have snatched at it,\" Keegan said. \"He might not have been able to get the timing and the power on it that it needed, because there was very little pace on the ball when it came to him.\" But Shearer launched himself into a flying leap, flexed his neck muscles and used his forehead to drive the ball across Oliver Kahn and into the net to deliver England their first senior tournament victory over Germany since 1966. </p> <p>It was enough to win Shearer the headlines, too, and the official man-of-the-match award, and Keegan came into the after-match press conference practically bursting with told-you-so pleasure in the performance of his talismanic centre-forward. </p> <p>\"Alan Shearer has answered his critics again,\" the coach proclaimed, \"so just give him two or three days' rest before you start back at him. He's never given me anything other than a hundred per cent when he's put on that shirt. He's a man among men, and that's why he's the captain of my England side.\" </p> <p>Shearer, too, felt he had rebutted the criticism of recent weeks, including an internet poll purporting to prove that three-quarters of the nation's football fans wanted him out. </p> <p>\"Tonight the fans gave me the same reception that they've given me in every England game,\" he said. \"It's only certain people in the press who want me out, but I can handle that. I don't really care, to be honest.\" </p> <p>And yet Shearer's performance during the first half of the match in the Stade Communale on Saturday night had provided nothing but further ammunition for those who believe that, despite the unassailable achievements of his career, at 29 he is no longer a deserving candidate for automatic selection. While England were struggling to get the ball away from the Germans, Shearer looked a sluggish and peripheral figure. It was his fellow striker, Michael Owen, with whom he has yet to forge even the faintest semblance of a true partnership, who ignited the fires of English resistance 10 minutes before half-time, when his header forced Kahn to tip the ball on to a post. </p> <p>But it was Shearer who scored the goal and Owen who was subsequently taken off when the team's resistance needed stiffening. Shearer has now started and finished every one of the 12 matches of Keegan's Euro 2000 campaign, and this was his seventh goal. His strike ratio is one reason Keegan loves him, but there are surely others, and not all of them can be put into words. </p> <p>When Keegan tried to explain it yesterday, he ended up describing his regret at Shearer's decision, announced in February, to leave the international scene at the end of the present tournament. The coach blames the media. \"You can't keep picking him up and throwing him down,\" he said. \"I think that's what you've done. You put him up there and the minute he's gone just a little bit below par, because he hasn't scored a goal, you've kicked him around. It's taken its toll on him. But I've never discussed it with him, and please don't say that I have because it would make him sound like a whinger, and I don't think he's that. I think he's a real man, and he's a leader, and he showed it again last night. I don't think there's another Alan Shearer in England at the moment.\" </p> <p>And yet, despite expressing his sorrow in the clearest terms, Keegan declined in somewhat mystifying terms an invitation to say that he would do the obvious by asking Shearer to change his mind. \"Alan is his own man,\" he declared. \"I've never discussed it with him. I've not talked to him [about it] today and I won't talk to him tomorrow. He knows without me talking to him. I was very disappointed when he announced it. I said to him, 'Think about it long and hard.' He said, 'I've been thinking about it for six or seven months.' So I don't think he'll change his mind. He's the sort of guy who makes up his mind and that's it. But if he did, I for one would be delighted. And so would the players.\" </p> <p>Naturally enough, Keegan doesn't like being told by any player that he is not available for international duty. \"I don't want anyone to say that they don't want to play for England again, and that includes some of the players, like Paul Merson, who have. I'm very disappointed with that. I still think Alan's got something to offer. If you're honest with yourself, despite some of the fantastic alternatives we've got, if you were in my position, then you'd probably plump for him just like I do, because you know what you're going to get from him. It's for the others to force their way in.\" </p> <p>It was Keegan who paid \u00a315m to take Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United in 1996. \"I don't care what people think as long as the people around me believe in me,\" Shearer said, as calm as ever in the euphoric aftermath of victory, and few can ever have believed in him with as much fervour as the England coach. Nevertheless Keegan sounded resigned to entering the 2002 World Cup campaign with a different player in the No9 shirt that Shearer has occupied on 60 occasions. </p> <p>\"He made his decision and he announced it in the way he wanted,\" Keegan said. \"I don't know what he's thinking. I suppose the best way for him to finish would be to pick up that Euro 2000 trophy. That's a dream at the moment, and it's our job to make it a reality for him. It's his job, too, and he can have a major part in it, as he showed last night. </p> <p>\"It would be going out in style for him. It's what he wants, the players and the staff desperately want it to happen, and certainly it's what the fans want. And then I guess he'll close the book, and that will be a nice way to end it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office has made its first after-tax loss for 24 years, it was announced today. The organisation reported post-tax losses of \u00a3264m for the last financial year, almost exclusively because of government plans to pay benefits directly into bank accounts from 2003. It has \"written down\" \u00a3571m of assets as part of a project to computerise its network of more than 18,500 post offices. It said it could not see how it could justify such a large investment because sufficient new earnings could not be generated to replace the lost income. Benefit payments account for around one third of income for post offices and many sub-post masters have warned of a wave of closures, especially in rural areas, because of the loss of benefit payments business. Profit before tax was \u00a3474m - down by 13% on the previous year. This was mainly because the Post Office froze or reduced postage prices over the last financial year. The Post Office said its turnover was up by 7% last year to \u00a37,522m, which its chairman, Neville Bain, said was a \"creditable performance\" in difficult trading conditions and with increasing competition. He said the reduction in underlying profits was not unexpected and was reflected in government targets for the year. The Post Office chief executive, John Roberts, said the loss was a \"blow\", but predicted that the organisation would be back in profit next year. He described today's loss as a \"blip\" but expected profits of between \u00a3200m and \u00a3300m next year. Mr Roberts stressed that the losses would be covered by the Post Office and would not lead to stamp price increases, office closures or job cuts. \"It is a one-off. We are trading very profitably but we have to write down these assets.\" Almost 8,000 post offices have already been automated under the so-called Horizon project and 300 more are being equipped each week.",

But her pronouncements and those of her colleagues are about to have a profound influence on the way our law develops.</p> <p>McLachlin is the newly installed Chief Justice of Canada, the first woman to hold this powerful and influential post. She heads the nine-judge supreme court of Canada, the country's highest court. But why should the rulings of a court thousands of miles away in a foreign country affect what happens here?</p> <p>For the answer, see Margaret Brown v Procurator Fiscal. That was the Scottish case that caused a furore last February when the appeal court ruled that 30-year-old Brown's admission that she was driving while over the alcohol limit could not be used against her. Since that was a key piece of evidence, the case had to be dropped.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act, which comes into force in October, will bring the European Convention on Human Rights into English law. The convention has been part of Scottish law for more than a year as a result of the act which brought in devolution. Since 1982, Canada has had a charter of rights and freedoms modelled on the European convention. As the judgments in Brown's case and others in the last year show, Canada's 18 years of case law are certain to be mined heavily by our judges when cases with human rights points come before our courts.</p> <p>The judgment in Brown's case is peppered with dicta from McLachlin and other Canadian supreme court judges. Our courts will have to take account of judgments from the European court in Strasbourg in deciding cases that come before them, but the Brown judgment draws even more more extensively on case law from Canada, where the laws and values are similar to Britain's.</p> <p>The Scottish judges quote McLachlin's pronouncement in a 1990 case: \"The protection conferred by a legal system which grants the accused immunity from incriminating himself at trial but offers no protection with respect to pre-trial statements would be illusory.\" And: \"A person in the power of the state in the course of the criminal process has the right to choose whether to speak to the police or remain silent.\"</p> <p>Interpreted by a generation of activist judges, the Canadian charter has had a revolutionary effect, little anticipated back in 1982. The supreme court's rulings have been controversial, much criticised in academic journals, newspaper leaders and news magazines. The judges, critics say, have usurped the role of parliament. Constitutional experts and court watchers predict that the Human Rights Act will similarly politicise British judges.</p> <p>So when Lord Woolf met the press this month for the first time in his new role as Lord Chief Justice of England, I was in Ottawa, following a Mountie through the corridors of Canada's supreme court building to the chief justice's wood-panelled office. I was greeted not by a 67-year-old man but by a young-looking woman of 56. However similar the two countries' laws and institutions, Canada's senior judges are much more representative of the people they serve.</p> <p>Even the titles in Britain assume that women will never hold them: Lord Chief Justice, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (the full title of the law lords). No woman in Britain has ever held one of the two highest posts, Lord Chief Justice or Master of the Rolls, or sat in our highest court, the House of Lords. (In Britain the Lord Chief Justice is the senior judge but does not sit in the highest court - he heads the court of appeal's criminal division; in Canada the chief justice heads the supreme court, a role more akin to the that of the senior law lord in Britain - a post just taken up by Lord Bingham, who was till this month Lord Chief Justice.)</p> <p>While McLachlin is the first woman to occupy Canada's highest judicial office, the supreme court has had women members for nearly 20 years. Of the nine judges, three are currently women - including Louise Arbour, formerly chief prosecutor at the UN war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</p> <p>Unlike Britain's senior judiciary, dominated by the products of elite public schools, McLachlin, like most Canadian judges, was state- educated. She grew up as one of five children in the small farming community of Pincher Creek, Alberta. \"We didn't have much money. We struggled,\" she told guests at her swearing-in ceremony. \"What you could do mattered more than where you came from.\"</p> <p>Her parents both had German roots. The Scottish surname came from her first husband, Rory, who died young, when their son was 12. Rory encouraged her to go to law school: \"Without his infusions of confidence I would never have believed I could have succeeded in the male-dominated legal profession.\"</p> <p>Eleven years ago, after seven years as a judge in British Columbia, she got the call to the nation's supreme court in Ottawa. Her son, Angus, who had to leave his friends in Vancouver, told her: \"Go for it, Mom.\" She married her second husband, a lawyer, eight years ago.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, women were as scarce in the law schools of Canada as they were in Britain's law faculties. Yet in Canada they have made it to the top of the system as they have not here. \"I do think that because women sometimes have had different experiences in life they may bring perspectives that are important to the discussion table,\" says McLachlin. \"You can have a richer, fuller discussion and one that better reflects the real values and concerns of society.\"</p> <p>Critics of the court's activism counter that it is for the people's elected representatives in parliament to fashion the law to reflect the values and concerns of society, and not for the judges. The view that the judges have grown too powerful is a widespread theme in the Canadian media. Typical is a leader in the Montreal Gazette: \"The supreme court has become a political institution. Its power should be checked.\"</p> <p>The court, indeed, has the power to strike down statutes passed by parliament and provincial legislatures, and it is a power it uses freely. In Britain, judges will not be able to strike down a statute; there will be a fast-track procedure for parliament to amend any law found to breach human rights. McLachlin believes, however, that the difference may be more apparent than real.</p> <p>Between 1982 and 1998 the Canadian supreme court struck down 58 statutes. Last year, in a controversial ruling hailed as a victory for gay rights, it outlawed any provisions in a statute which define a spouse as \"a member of the opposite sex\". That one judgment will mean rewriting up to 1,000 federal and provincial statutes. Conrad Black's National Post took issue with the ruling, claiming \"public opinion is too divided on gay rights for judges to take sides\". But McLachlin points to a survey last month showing strong public support for the charter.</p> <p>In 1991 she delivered the majority judgment striking down rape shield laws protecting alleged rape victims from questioning about their sexual history. In a powerfully reasoned judgment, she argued that the accused's right to a fair trial should not be sacrificed. Citing the Birmingham Six and other cases of wrongful conviction, she insisted: \"The price is too great.\"</p> <p>Another woman judge, Claire l'Heureux-Dub\u00e9, delivered an equally eloquent dissent. The rape shield laws were rewritten but have come before the court again in a case awaiting judgment. Other current issues concern gun-control laws, child pornography and whether Canadians charged with murder in the US should be extradited to face the death penalty, which is outlawed in Canada.</p> <p>A new book, The Charter Revolution and the Court Party, by political scientists FL Morton and Rainer Knopf, accuses the court of allowing itself to be hijacked by women's organisations, civil liberties bodies and other interest groups permitted to intervene in cases. Even the Italian senate, campaigning globally against the death penalty, was allowed to intervene in the extradition case. British courts, which have so far been sparing in allowing interveners - Amnesty International's role in the Pinochet case was an example - will have to hear more when the Human Rights Act comes into force, according to Robert Hazell, professor of government and the constitution at University College London. McLachlin insists: \"This court is not hijacked by any interest groups or anyone else. We listen to all the arguments and make our decisions accordingly, I think, in a very independent way.\"</p> <p>Most Canadians were unprepared for the revolution the charter has brought. But, she says, the supreme court signalled from the outset \"that they were going to take these rights and freedoms very seriously, that they were going to give a generous, purposive approach to them, that they were going to interpret them in the world context of human rights issues and human rights law\". There's little doubt that British judges will do the same.</p>",

He calculated these as savage exaggerations of trends in the medium towards stupidity and prurience. So Andersen was surprised when friends in TV seriously suggested he could maximise the book's profits by selling the formats for these potential ratings winners to the industry. </p> <p>The impossibility of any send-up of American TV surpassing what is already sent out is emphasised by a documentary - Who Would Want To Marry A Millionaire?

He calculated these as savage exaggerations of trends in the medium towards stupidity and prurience. So Andersen was surprised when friends in TV seriously suggested he could maximise the book's profits by selling the formats for these potential ratings winners to the industry.

      "body": "<p>Since the early 70s, women have broken through every career barrier and transformed traditional assumptions about female social roles. But 30 years on, the pace of change freezes as they look in the mirror. Teenage girls are stuck in the glaring lights of the catwalk. Blind to realistic and healthy physiques, they measure themselves against the ideal female images captured on camera. Some girls, particularly those who are perfectionists, pursue this ideal in defiance of common sense. Dieting to the point of starvation, they are literally dying for a model figure.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the women's unit in the cabinet office is holding what is widely but unofficially referred to as \"the super-waif summit\" - a meeting with health experts and designers, stylists and magazine editors. Minister for women Tessa Jowell is expected to chair a debate on the causes and possible remedies of girls' constant dieting and obsession with their appearance. In particular, the women's unit is expected to confront fashion industry leaders over the prevalence of skinny models and their effect on girls' wellbeing.</p> <p>This meeting was planned in the wake of the Listen Up report released in April, in which teenage girls were described as dissatisfied with their physique and oppressed by fashionable female icons. While some journalists have argued that a young girl's disappointment at realising she is not and never will be as thin and pretty as her ideal is the stuff of soap opera rather than politics, the report asserted that \"the government takes these concerns seriously and is considering what action might be feasible\".</p> <p>This position has strong support in well-documented findings that a girl's sense of self-esteem and emotional wellbeing are closely related to how she feels about her body. It is government business, then, to bring to account an industry that is generating a public health hazard. But how effective can it be to target fashion industry leaders over girls' (and women's) skewed physical ideals? After all, girls learn the language of bodily dissatisfaction in many contexts. Among friends, they endorse the ideal: \"Doesn't she have a perfect figure?\" they ask. \"Don't you wish you could look like her?\" They then bond as sisters by promising to diet together.</p> <p>Most teenage girls are daughters of dieters. They see their mothers refuse dessert and complain about their thighs, stomach, arms, chin, rear. Many mothers, feeling responsible for a daughter's appearance, give as many warnings to \"be careful what you eat\" as to take care with sex. A girl can be hurt, too, by a father's appraising looks, kidding quips and snide remarks about her physique. All this from people who care for her and love her: think what's in store for her from her enemies if her figure doesn't match the norm.</p> <p>Is the fashion industry, then, just a scapegoat? Magazine editors are already airing their defence. Vogue's Alexandra Shulman is reported as saying you don't catch anorexia from opening the pages of her magazine. So is this one more example of ministers patronising women?</p> <p>Though there is far more to girls' persistent self-denigration than media imagery, it is impossible to argue away the link between dieting, eating disorders and bodily dissatisfaction on the one hand, and idealised images of skinny beauties on the other. The British Medical Association reviewed a range of research from international sources and while it admitted this did not prove outright a causal link between thin models and rates of eating disorders, the correlation was sufficiently high to argue that anorexia is powerfully fuelled by media images.</p> <p>While less than 3% of young women suffer from anorexia or bulimia, 90% of British women are said to diet sometimes and bad body fever - that sense of our bodies being aesthetically under par - is as common as dust. So it does make sense, after all, to force the powerful fashion industry to be accountable for its impact on the nation's health.</p> <p>There are, however, other tacks to explore. Ideals are not passively imposed on young minds. Some groups of girls and women move comfortably in their own bodies, even in a culture replete with fashion and diet industries. To date, few cases of anorexia and bulimia have been reported among British black and Asian girls. They see the same images of thin women the white girls do, but do not internalise them as models they should aspire to.</p> <p>Perhaps we could learn what safety mechanism is triggered here. These girls may look to the real women they rub shoulders with to identify what's attractive and appealing. Habits of family eating, too, may prevent bizarre calorific self-denial.</p> <p>When the intelligence and imagination of most teenage girls sticks on the pages of a sickly culture, we need not only to attack its causes but also to uncover the secrets of resistance.</p> <p><b>Joanna Rothenberg, 13</b></p> <p>Today we went on a school trip, so we didn't have to wear uniform. Getting dressed is hard because I'm really conscious of how I look and there's always competition about who's wearing the most expensive, stylish clothes. We only went to a farm but people were wearing designer tops and some even had make-up on - I didn't as I only wear a bit on special occasions. I wore a Little Miss Naughty T-shirt and some Nike running trousers and a jumper. I'm quite slim so I didn't worry about how my figure looked.</p> <p>I didn't have breakfast because I don't like eating in the morning but throughout the day I ate whatever I wanted to without thinking about it. Sometimes if I'm eating excessive amounts I worry but it's not really a problem for me. Friends at school are often dieting and worrying about eating too much. There is this idea that prettier girls will be more popular but in reality I don't think people judge totally on appearance.</p> <p>During lunch break, we looked at some magazines. The models make you feel bad sometimes because you're not as skinny as them, but then you look past it and in a couple of days it doesn't really matter.</p> <p>When we were walking home, some guys were looking at my friends - not because of the way they were dressed but because of the way they're formed, because they've already got boobs and stuff. The girls are really aware of who's the thinnest and sexiest.</p> <p>After school, I watched TV. The girls in pop videos wear such revealing clothes. Sometimes I think they look really good and I'll want to dress like that and go to those kinds of places. But in real life you'd just feel weird. When I'm out on the street, I feel really self-conscious and I compare myself to the people around me, but when I'm at home or with my friends, I feel comfortable.</p> <p><b>Lorna Hankin, 17</b></p> <p>I've eaten healthily all day, starting with cereal, yoghurt and fruit for breakfast. This isn't to lose weight - I don't think I need to - but because I was living on tea and toast before and had no energy. I had a sandwich, crisps and fruit for lunch, and later had to fight the urge to eat chocolate. I sometimes overcome it by drinking water. If you do indulge and people comment, it makes you feel guilty and self-conscious. Men can eat what they like but people tend to comment on what girls eat.</p> <p>I'm in the sixth form and we don't have to wear uniform, so I'm very conscious of what I put on every day. I'm happy with my body and I'm size 10, so I don't really have to worry, but I avoid clothes I think make me look big. I don't like my stomach when I bend over, so I won't wear belly-tops and I don't like going without tights because I don't tan easily.</p> <p>I spend about 15 minutes on my make-up - I'm always aware of covering up spots and things. As a brunette, I'm conscious that I don't live up to the ideal of a woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I also sometimes wish I was taller.</p> <p>My friends and I look at models in magazines and say things like \"Oh, she's so thin\" or \"She's got a horrible mouth\". If boys think a girl is attractive, then you take more notice. Sometimes the models are too thin - I wouldn't want to look ill like them. My main aim is to feel good and mostly I do because I think I look OK. As a young woman, you do get noticed - and you do find often the most popular girls are the prettiest ones rather than the nicest.</p> <p>I don't know anyone who's got anorexia or bulimia, and I think it comes from the individual rather than the media. A lot of the time, girls my age are looking for reassurance, so they may say they're looking fat when they know they're not because they just want to hear that they're not.</p> <p><b>Roma Norriss, 16</b></p> <p>I would be lying if I said I wasn't conscious of how I look. I always try to wear clothes that don't make me look fat or unattractive. I usually wear something around my waist, like a sarong over trousers.</p> <p>I didn't have any breakfast this morning because I don't like eating first thing and don't have time anyway. It's got nothing to do with losing weight and I don't have an unhealthy view of food. It's strange because I'm actually quite huge, but I rarely get hungry and rarely eat during the day. I go through phases when I don't eat anything at all, but then other times I eat everything I see.</p> <p>Today a group of us were talking about how ridiculous it is that the modern ideal is for women to be really skinny and boyish when for centuries it's been larger women who've been seen as attractive. It's difficult for girls to feel happy and confident about how they look when the media has created an environment that encourages girls to be skinny.</p> <p>We are given Barbies as children, which must have had an influence, yet apparently you'd die if you had the equivalent of Barbie's vital statistics. I don't feel self-conscious about my body in front of my friends - it's not an issue for me. I do have friends who have eating disorders and have done horrific things to themselves, but all the boys say they like chunky women, so I don't feel like I have to lose weight for them.</p> <p>I buy men's magazines and don't mind the women in them. Models are nice to look at but I don't compare myself with them and I don't find it hard to accept that there are many more beautiful women in the world than me. I think it's bad that models are so thin, but more because of the effect it has on other people than on me personally.

      "bodyText": "Since the early 70s, women have broken through every career barrier and transformed traditional assumptions about female social roles. But 30 years on, the pace of change freezes as they look in the mirror. Teenage girls are stuck in the glaring lights of the catwalk. Blind to realistic and healthy physiques, they measure themselves against the ideal female images captured on camera. Some girls, particularly those who are perfectionists, pursue this ideal in defiance of common sense. Dieting to the point of starvation, they are literally dying for a model figure. On Wednesday, the women's unit in the cabinet office is holding what is widely but unofficially referred to as \"the super-waif summit\" - a meeting with health experts and designers, stylists and magazine editors. Minister for women Tessa Jowell is expected to chair a debate on the causes and possible remedies of girls' constant dieting and obsession with their appearance. In particular, the women's unit is expected to confront fashion industry leaders over the prevalence of skinny models and their effect on girls' wellbeing. This meeting was planned in the wake of the Listen Up report released in April, in which teenage girls were described as dissatisfied with their physique and oppressed by fashionable female icons. While some journalists have argued that a young girl's disappointment at realising she is not and never will be as thin and pretty as her ideal is the stuff of soap opera rather than politics, the report asserted that \"the government takes these concerns seriously and is considering what action might be feasible\". This position has strong support in well-documented findings that a girl's sense of self-esteem and emotional wellbeing are closely related to how she feels about her body. It is government business, then, to bring to account an industry that is generating a public health hazard. But how effective can it be to target fashion industry leaders over girls' (and women's) skewed physical ideals? After all, girls learn the language of bodily dissatisfaction in many contexts. Among friends, they endorse the ideal: \"Doesn't she have a perfect figure?\" they ask. \"Don't you wish you could look like her?\" They then bond as sisters by promising to diet together. Most teenage girls are daughters of dieters. They see their mothers refuse dessert and complain about their thighs, stomach, arms, chin, rear. Many mothers, feeling responsible for a daughter's appearance, give as many warnings to \"be careful what you eat\" as to take care with sex. A girl can be hurt, too, by a father's appraising looks, kidding quips and snide remarks about her physique. All this from people who care for her and love her: think what's in store for her from her enemies if her figure doesn't match the norm. Is the fashion industry, then, just a scapegoat? Magazine editors are already airing their defence. Vogue's Alexandra Shulman is reported as saying you don't catch anorexia from opening the pages of her magazine. So is this one more example of ministers patronising women? Though there is far more to girls' persistent self-denigration than media imagery, it is impossible to argue away the link between dieting, eating disorders and bodily dissatisfaction on the one hand, and idealised images of skinny beauties on the other. The British Medical Association reviewed a range of research from international sources and while it admitted this did not prove outright a causal link between thin models and rates of eating disorders, the correlation was sufficiently high to argue that anorexia is powerfully fuelled by media images. While less than 3% of young women suffer from anorexia or bulimia, 90% of British women are said to diet sometimes and bad body fever - that sense of our bodies being aesthetically under par - is as common as dust. So it does make sense, after all, to force the powerful fashion industry to be accountable for its impact on the nation's health. There are, however, other tacks to explore. Ideals are not passively imposed on young minds. Some groups of girls and women move comfortably in their own bodies, even in a culture replete with fashion and diet industries. To date, few cases of anorexia and bulimia have been reported among British black and Asian girls. They see the same images of thin women the white girls do, but do not internalise them as models they should aspire to. Perhaps we could learn what safety mechanism is triggered here. These girls may look to the real women they rub shoulders with to identify what's attractive and appealing. Habits of family eating, too, may prevent bizarre calorific self-denial. When the intelligence and imagination of most teenage girls sticks on the pages of a sickly culture, we need not only to attack its causes but also to uncover the secrets of resistance. Joanna Rothenberg, 13 Today we went on a school trip, so we didn't have to wear uniform. Getting dressed is hard because I'm really conscious of how I look and there's always competition about who's wearing the most expensive, stylish clothes. We only went to a farm but people were wearing designer tops and some even had make-up on - I didn't as I only wear a bit on special occasions. I wore a Little Miss Naughty T-shirt and some Nike running trousers and a jumper. I'm quite slim so I didn't worry about how my figure looked. I didn't have breakfast because I don't like eating in the morning but throughout the day I ate whatever I wanted to without thinking about it. Sometimes if I'm eating excessive amounts I worry but it's not really a problem for me. Friends at school are often dieting and worrying about eating too much. There is this idea that prettier girls will be more popular but in reality I don't think people judge totally on appearance. During lunch break, we looked at some magazines. The models make you feel bad sometimes because you're not as skinny as them, but then you look past it and in a couple of days it doesn't really matter. When we were walking home, some guys were looking at my friends - not because of the way they were dressed but because of the way they're formed, because they've already got boobs and stuff. The girls are really aware of who's the thinnest and sexiest. After school, I watched TV. The girls in pop videos wear such revealing clothes. Sometimes I think they look really good and I'll want to dress like that and go to those kinds of places. But in real life you'd just feel weird. When I'm out on the street, I feel really self-conscious and I compare myself to the people around me, but when I'm at home or with my friends, I feel comfortable. Lorna Hankin, 17 I've eaten healthily all day, starting with cereal, yoghurt and fruit for breakfast. This isn't to lose weight - I don't think I need to - but because I was living on tea and toast before and had no energy. I had a sandwich, crisps and fruit for lunch, and later had to fight the urge to eat chocolate. I sometimes overcome it by drinking water. If you do indulge and people comment, it makes you feel guilty and self-conscious. Men can eat what they like but people tend to comment on what girls eat. I'm in the sixth form and we don't have to wear uniform, so I'm very conscious of what I put on every day. I'm happy with my body and I'm size 10, so I don't really have to worry, but I avoid clothes I think make me look big. I don't like my stomach when I bend over, so I won't wear belly-tops and I don't like going without tights because I don't tan easily. I spend about 15 minutes on my make-up - I'm always aware of covering up spots and things. As a brunette, I'm conscious that I don't live up to the ideal of a woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes. I also sometimes wish I was taller. My friends and I look at models in magazines and say things like \"Oh, she's so thin\" or \"She's got a horrible mouth\". If boys think a girl is attractive, then you take more notice. Sometimes the models are too thin - I wouldn't want to look ill like them. My main aim is to feel good and mostly I do because I think I look OK. As a young woman, you do get noticed - and you do find often the most popular girls are the prettiest ones rather than the nicest. I don't know anyone who's got anorexia or bulimia, and I think it comes from the individual rather than the media. A lot of the time, girls my age are looking for reassurance, so they may say they're looking fat when they know they're not because they just want to hear that they're not. Roma Norriss, 16 I would be lying if I said I wasn't conscious of how I look. I always try to wear clothes that don't make me look fat or unattractive. I usually wear something around my waist, like a sarong over trousers. I didn't have any breakfast this morning because I don't like eating first thing and don't have time anyway. It's got nothing to do with losing weight and I don't have an unhealthy view of food. It's strange because I'm actually quite huge, but I rarely get hungry and rarely eat during the day. I go through phases when I don't eat anything at all, but then other times I eat everything I see. Today a group of us were talking about how ridiculous it is that the modern ideal is for women to be really skinny and boyish when for centuries it's been larger women who've been seen as attractive. It's difficult for girls to feel happy and confident about how they look when the media has created an environment that encourages girls to be skinny. We are given Barbies as children, which must have had an influence, yet apparently you'd die if you had the equivalent of Barbie's vital statistics. I don't feel self-conscious about my body in front of my friends - it's not an issue for me. I do have friends who have eating disorders and have done horrific things to themselves, but all the boys say they like chunky women, so I don't feel like I have to lose weight for them. I buy men's magazines and don't mind the women in them. Models are nice to look at but I don't compare myself with them and I don't find it hard to accept that there are many more beautiful women in the world than me. I think it's bad that models are so thin, but more because of the effect it has on other people than on me personally. I do suffer from slight body dysmorphia - I think everyone does to some extent. Nina Fagon, 18 I don't worry about my body shape as I don't follow models and fashion and things like that. It doesn't interest me. I was watching this catwalk show on TV the other day and the models looked really malnourished. It was quite scary - I hadn't realised it was that bad. I've got a typical Afro-Caribbean figure in that I'm bottom-heavy with thick thighs, but I don't have any problems with the way I look. I watch a lot of films but I don't want to be like the women I see in them. They're them and I'm me. A lot of my friends have got a complex about their bodies but I don't see the point of it - there's nothing you can do to change your basic body shape, unless you drastically over-eat or under-eat. They associate being big with being unfit, which is not true, and they complain about their size without doing any exercise. I eat three meals a day because that's when I'm hungry - I don't feel the need to snack. Getting dressed in the morning, it's a case of what goes together out of what's clean. I don't wear make-up, apart from a bit of lipstick when I'm going out, and I dress the same wherever I go, though if I'm going out I may put on a little top. I don't feel the need to hide anything - I've been dancing since I was two or three, so I've always had to be in front of people in leotards.

      "body": "<p>English football has been left facing the most crucial days in its entire history after Uefa, the game's European governing body, threatened the team with expulsion from Euro 2000 if its fans caused any further problems during the remainder of the tournament. </p> <p>The unprecedented ultimatum and the behaviour of English fans has severely embarrassed the British government which came under fire from Uefa president Lennart Johannson for not doing enough to prevent hooligans from travelling abroad. </p> <p>After a weekend of violence in Charleroi and Brussels, Mr Johannson said: \"Fans cannot be allowed to behave like this again and create havoc. The UK government owes it to everyone concerned to take similar steps to those taken in other countries to stop those troublesome fans from travelling abroad. </p> <p>\"Other governments have shown that it can be done. The UEFA executive committee called on the government of the UK and the Football Association of London to take the necessary steps to stop English hooligans from travelling abroad.\" </p> <p>With fears increasing that there could be further violence in the run-up to tomorrow's game against Romania, Mr Johannson warned: \"Uefa will have to determine whether the presence of the English team in the tournament should be maintained should there be a repetition of similar incidents. We cannot afford a repeat of the fans' behaviour of recent days.\" </p> <p>It is believed to be the first time that a major footballing nation has been threatened with expulsion from a high profile tournament. </p> <p>Prime minister Tony Blair, responding to Uefa's ultimatum, said: \"Hopefully this threat will bring to their senses anyone tempted to continue the mindless thuggery that has brought such shame to the country.\" Uefa took the decision to deliver the ultimatum to the England team following an emergency meeting of its executive committee. </p> <p>Mr Johannson said that the behaviour of the English had scarred the tournament and that he was afraid that one day, innocent people could be killed in the violence which has blighted Euro 2000. </p> <p>Mr Johannson added: \"We cannot forget what happened in Heysel. We cannot ignore the incidents in Istanbul and Copenhagen and what has happened in Charleroi and Brussels.\" </p> <p>Kevin Miles, co-ordinator of the Football Supporters Association Fans' Embassies, at the tournament, said: \"While all genuine supporters deplore any trouble caused by anyone following the English team, Uefa's proposal would seem to punish the innocent to an extent that even the Belgian police have not yet managed.\" </p> <p>Prior to the Uefa announcement, an embarrassed home secretary Jack Straw acknowledged that he had allowed Britain to enter the Euro 2000 football championship with major loopholes in its anti-hooligan laws, including excessive discretion for magistrates to permit troublemakers to travel abroad. </p> <p>Conservatives rounded on Mr Straw saying the Home Office had backtracked on a commitment to introduce a bill in this session giving magistrates powers to impound passports of anyone liable to commit a football related-offence abroad, even if they had not been convicted in British courts. </p> <p>The then Home Office minister Kate Hoey had given the undertaking in parliament in May 1999. She later withdrew the idea, saying it would be better to wait to see if magistrates used new duties contained in a private members bill sponsored by Tory MPs to impound passports of convicted hooligans. </p> <p>Mr Straw said yesterday that he planned to make it mandatory on magistrates to remove a passport automatically from anyone convicted of a domestic football-related offence. Magistrates will be required to demand the convicted hooligan surrenders his passport for the duration of a tournament. </p> <p>Now magistrates have a statutory duty to impose such travelling bans only if they believe it will prevent violence. But since this new tightened power came into force last September only 23 of the 203 hooligans convicted of domestic offences have been made subject to international banning orders. </p> <p>It is also likely that magistrates will be asked to ban fans from travelling abroad, even if they have not been convicted of an offence, if the police can persuade a magistrate they are likely to commit an offence. One likely criteria is expected to be if the suspected hooligan has a criminal record. </p> <p><strong>Latest chapter in long history of havoc</strong></p> <p><strong> 1974</strong> Tottenham banned from playing two European games at White Hart Lane after fans riot in Uefa Cup final at Feyenoord </p> <p><strong> 1975</strong> Leeds banned from Europe for four seasons, later cut to two, after riots during European Cup final in Paris </p> <p><strong> 1977</strong> Manchester United expelled from European Cup Winners' Cup after crowd trouble against St Etienne.

      "bodyText": "English football has been left facing the most crucial days in its entire history after Uefa, the game's European governing body, threatened the team with expulsion from Euro 2000 if its fans caused any further problems during the remainder of the tournament. The unprecedented ultimatum and the behaviour of English fans has severely embarrassed the British government which came under fire from Uefa president Lennart Johannson for not doing enough to prevent hooligans from travelling abroad. After a weekend of violence in Charleroi and Brussels, Mr Johannson said: \"Fans cannot be allowed to behave like this again and create havoc. The UK government owes it to everyone concerned to take similar steps to those taken in other countries to stop those troublesome fans from travelling abroad. \"Other governments have shown that it can be done. The UEFA executive committee called on the government of the UK and the Football Association of London to take the necessary steps to stop English hooligans from travelling abroad.\" With fears increasing that there could be further violence in the run-up to tomorrow's game against Romania, Mr Johannson warned: \"Uefa will have to determine whether the presence of the English team in the tournament should be maintained should there be a repetition of similar incidents. We cannot afford a repeat of the fans' behaviour of recent days.\" It is believed to be the first time that a major footballing nation has been threatened with expulsion from a high profile tournament. Prime minister Tony Blair, responding to Uefa's ultimatum, said: \"Hopefully this threat will bring to their senses anyone tempted to continue the mindless thuggery that has brought such shame to the country.\" Uefa took the decision to deliver the ultimatum to the England team following an emergency meeting of its executive committee. Mr Johannson said that the behaviour of the English had scarred the tournament and that he was afraid that one day, innocent people could be killed in the violence which has blighted Euro 2000. Mr Johannson added: \"We cannot forget what happened in Heysel. We cannot ignore the incidents in Istanbul and Copenhagen and what has happened in Charleroi and Brussels.\" Kevin Miles, co-ordinator of the Football Supporters Association Fans' Embassies, at the tournament, said: \"While all genuine supporters deplore any trouble caused by anyone following the English team, Uefa's proposal would seem to punish the innocent to an extent that even the Belgian police have not yet managed.\" Prior to the Uefa announcement, an embarrassed home secretary Jack Straw acknowledged that he had allowed Britain to enter the Euro 2000 football championship with major loopholes in its anti-hooligan laws, including excessive discretion for magistrates to permit troublemakers to travel abroad. Conservatives rounded on Mr Straw saying the Home Office had backtracked on a commitment to introduce a bill in this session giving magistrates powers to impound passports of anyone liable to commit a football related-offence abroad, even if they had not been convicted in British courts. The then Home Office minister Kate Hoey had given the undertaking in parliament in May 1999. She later withdrew the idea, saying it would be better to wait to see if magistrates used new duties contained in a private members bill sponsored by Tory MPs to impound passports of convicted hooligans. Mr Straw said yesterday that he planned to make it mandatory on magistrates to remove a passport automatically from anyone convicted of a domestic football-related offence. Magistrates will be required to demand the convicted hooligan surrenders his passport for the duration of a tournament. Now magistrates have a statutory duty to impose such travelling bans only if they believe it will prevent violence. But since this new tightened power came into force last September only 23 of the 203 hooligans convicted of domestic offences have been made subject to international banning orders. It is also likely that magistrates will be asked to ban fans from travelling abroad, even if they have not been convicted of an offence, if the police can persuade a magistrate they are likely to commit an offence. One likely criteria is expected to be if the suspected hooligan has a criminal record.

It will be the same on Tuesday.\" </p> <p>After Saturday's match the majority of England fans returned to Brussels, where there were more clashes, this time with local north African youths. </p> <p>But many fans complained they had been treated unfairly by police and the media. \"Everyone is making out that it was a major riot and although it looked bad there was only a minority of people involved,\" said Adrian Woodward from Essex. </p> <p>Terry Walker, another England fan who witnessed police baton charge an English mob in central Brussels on Saturday, said: \"They were trying to crack heads open and were pepper spraying anybody who came in their way. Not everyone is out here to cause problems.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, deported fans were returning home, protesting their innocence. Matt Jones, one of 215 fans deported, said he had been in Brussels less than two hours on Friday when riot police threw teargas into the pub where he and two friends were drinking. </p> <p>\"We deliberately chose a little pub down a side street to get out of the way of any trouble and I'd just got my second pint,\" he said. \"All we were doing is singing - and the national anthem of all things. </p> <p>\"The next thing we knew, the windows were smashed and coppers were throwing in tear gas. They were beating us down and I got a crack with a truncheon.\" </p> <p>The fans were held in crammed cells for 36 hours. </p> <p>\"Eight hundred and fifty of us were arrested and I reckon around 20 of them were hardcore,\" Mr Jones said. \"I went to all the games in the last World Cup and never had a sniff of trouble. But I tell you what, I'll never follow England abroad again.\"</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.euro2000.org\">Euro 2000 Official site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk\">Football Unlimited</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.the-fa.org\">Football Association</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ncis.co.uk\">National Criminal Intelligence Service</a></p>",

Whenever there has been the merest whiff of trouble, either in Charleroi or Brussels, police have been quick to respond. Major Michel Rompen of the Belgian police, who coordinated the security operation in Charleroi, said: \"We always said that we would be tough with hooligans, some predicted a catastrophe but in the end it was just a few incidents. It will be the same on Tuesday.\" After Saturday's match the majority of England fans returned to Brussels, where there were more clashes, this time with local north African youths. But many fans complained they had been treated unfairly by police and the media. \"Everyone is making out that it was a major riot and although it looked bad there was only a minority of people involved,\" said Adrian Woodward from Essex. Terry Walker, another England fan who witnessed police baton charge an English mob in central Brussels on Saturday, said: \"They were trying to crack heads open and were pepper spraying anybody who came in their way. Not everyone is out here to cause problems.\" Meanwhile, deported fans were returning home, protesting their innocence. Matt Jones, one of 215 fans deported, said he had been in Brussels less than two hours on Friday when riot police threw teargas into the pub where he and two friends were drinking. \"We deliberately chose a little pub down a side street to get out of the way of any trouble and I'd just got my second pint,\" he said. \"All we were doing is singing - and the national anthem of all things. \"The next thing we knew, the windows were smashed and coppers were throwing in tear gas. They were beating us down and I got a crack with a truncheon.\" The fans were held in crammed cells for 36 hours. \"Eight hundred and fifty of us were arrested and I reckon around 20 of them were hardcore,\" Mr Jones said. \"I went to all the games in the last World Cup and never had a sniff of trouble. But I tell you what, I'll never follow England abroad again.\" Useful links Euro 2000 Official site Football Unlimited Football Association National Criminal Intelligence Service",

      "bodyText": "The unthinkable may be about to happen in Zimbabwe: President Robert Mugabe could be facing humiliation and defeat for his Zanu-PF party in the coming weekend's parliamentary election. A new opinion poll suggests that the opposition Movement for Democratic Change is poised to win 70 of the 120 contested parliamentary seats. Under the constitution, Mr Mugabe - who has led Zimbabwe ever since his massive victory in the former British colony's first majority-rule elections in 1980 - appoints another 30 members to parliament. But yesterday the leader of the MDC challengers, Morgan Tsvangirai, said he would try to limit the president's ability to do so. The president's term lasts until 2002 but the MDC is trusting that if it wins Mr Mugabe will be pressed into going early. The thought of an opposition victory this weekend, if not of an immediate Mugabe resignation, no longer seems fanciful. Six weeks ago when Zanu-PF launched its election campaign with a wave of intimidation against supporters of the Movement for Democratic Change some opposition leaders considered calling for a boycott of an election they believed could not be free or fair. Now against all the earlier odds they sense victory, and yesterday 15,000 of their supporters sang, danced and cheered in Harare's Rufaro stadium in lethal anticipation. \"We showed Robert Mugabe the yellow card,\" the MDC president, Morgan Tsvangirai, told them - referring to February's nationwide vote that rejected Mugabe attempts to change the constitution. \"Now we show him the red one!\" A roar of triumphant laughter engulfed the stands and, on cue, hundreds of people waved little red cards. It was an evocative moment at the stadium where Prince Charles lowered the Union flag two decades ago in the independence ceremonies that saw Rhodesia give way to Zimbabwe \"We have enough of poverty, enough of racism, enough of Zanu-PF,\" Mr Tsvangirai said after beginning his speech by asking the crowd to stand in memory of the roughly 30 candidates and supporters who have been killed since the election campaign began. \"Robert Mugabe is a violent president who does not love the people of this country. He only loves power. We are not for retribution but those who have done the killing must answer for it.\" But there was also violence at the MDC rally itself, youths attacked three men suspected of being Zanu-PF supporters, one of whom had to be rescued by police with dogs. In spirit and in turnout, however, the contrast with Mr Mugabe's rally the day before was painful. Even though it was held at Highfield, close to Harare's biggest black township, the president's gathering mustered little more than 5,000 people. Loudspeakers were heard calling on bus drivers to bring more people. Tony Gara, the Zanu-PF chairman for Harare province, apologised: \"Your Excellency, you should know that your people work on Saturday and we also had very little time to arrange the rally.\" Mr Gara sounded almost like an MDC supporter when he rubbed in one of the main factors in the economic slump which has seen Mr Mugabe's popularity plummet: \"Some people also could not get here because of the fuel crisis,\" he told the president. The small number who did come were treated to a history lesson about Zimbabwe's colonial past and accusations that the British were some of the most racist people on earth. \"Zimbabwe is a black man's land and therefore a black man has the right to determine its future. We must remember the problems we went through when they ruled this country\" Mr Mugabe declared. But his rhetoric - and his favourite slogan, \"Zimbabwe will never be a colony again\" - seemed out of touch: most people are more concerned that the country's economy began to turn down in the 1990s and that they now face an unemployment rate said to be as high as 55%, and annual inflation of around 74%. \"Jobs are the main question, not land,\" Nelson Chamisa, the MDC's national youth secretary, told yesterday's opposition rally. The magnitude of Mr Mugabe's crisis today is hard to absorb. The MDC is a broader coalition even than the rainbow alliance forged by Nelson Mandela in South Africa. It includes whites who fought in the army in support of Rhodesia's white-rule leader, Ian Smith, as well as liberals who fought against him. It has thousands of blacks who used to be with the Zanu-PF guerrillas in the fight that began in 1967 for majority rule, as well as others who were rivals or kept their heads down in the war. There is room for caution.

Meetings between the companies went on all weekend and the aim is to make a formal announcement tomorrow. </p> <p>The agreement is in the mould of the AOL-Time Warner merger at the beginning of the year in which the old and new media worlds collided.

A statement issued by French media and utility group Vivendi yesterday said that the negotiations \"have now entered their final stage\". Meetings between the companies went on all weekend and the aim is to make a formal announcement tomorrow. The agreement is in the mould of the AOL-Time Warner merger at the beginning of the year in which the old and new media worlds collided. Seagram's Universal music publishing business is the largest in the world and includes artists Boyzone, Elton John and Shania Twain, while its film business has scored hits with The Mummy, Gladiator and U-571. Its television arm produces shows including Xena Warrior Princess and has a library of programmes such as Kojak, Murder She Wrote and Miami Vice. The business will provide a wealth of content for Vivendi's pay-TV distribution networks, including Canal Plus in France in which it already holds a 49% stake. The content though will also underpin the development of Vivendi's new media interests including its Vizzavi internet portal which is a joint venture with Vodafone-AirTouch.

The public view was that he was killed, but the Syrian government insisted he had committed suicide.</p> <p>\"The commander of police went to his house in the Dumor suburb where he was playing cards,\" a Syrian official said. \"He was presented with a charge sheet saying that he had to present himself the next day for investigation.

Others accused of corruption include Bashir al-Najar, the former head of Syrian intelligence; Mohammed Haider, the former deputy prime minister; and the former transport minister, Mufid Abdul Kerim.</p> <p>For Bashar to engage in anything more than a token drive against corrupt officials will be risky. A confrontation with ministers, police and army commanders taking paybacks could spark a rival power bid, or even a coup attempt.</p> <p>A serious anti-corruption programme may only be possible when, or if, he entrenches himself in power.</p> <p>But, according to one well-placed source in Syria, Bashar has already won the all-important backing of Asif Shauket, the commander of the military secret police, who is one of the main powers in the land and is married to the heir apparent's sister.</p>",

The amounts siphoned off run into millions of pounds; one unusually outspoken member of the Syrian parliament, Riad Seif, estimated yesterday that the \"commission\" taken on some public projects amounted to 30% of the projects' worth. \"It starts from the top,\" he said, though stressing he did not include the late president or Bashar, a view grudgingly shared on the street. Mr Riad blamed corruption at the top on greed and at the lower levels - among judges, policeman and other officials - on the very low salary scales. The former prime minister, Zoubi, died last month while under investigation. The public view was that he was killed, but the Syrian government insisted he had committed suicide. \"The commander of police went to his house in the Dumor suburb where he was playing cards,\" a Syrian official said. \"He was presented with a charge sheet saying that he had to present himself the next day for investigation. He went upstairs to his bedroom and shot himself. He was dead when he arrived in hospital.\" The official claimed he had creamed off millions of pounds during his time in office. Others accused of corruption include Bashir al-Najar, the former head of Syrian intelligence; Mohammed Haider, the former deputy prime minister; and the former transport minister, Mufid Abdul Kerim. For Bashar to engage in anything more than a token drive against corrupt officials will be risky. A confrontation with ministers, police and army commanders taking paybacks could spark a rival power bid, or even a coup attempt. A serious anti-corruption programme may only be possible when, or if, he entrenches himself in power. But, according to one well-placed source in Syria, Bashar has already won the all-important backing of Asif Shauket, the commander of the military secret police, who is one of the main powers in the land and is married to the heir apparent's sister.",

Salaries at the Bank of England - which has expanded its contingent of economists since the formation of the monetary policy committee are around \u00a35,000 a year higher, because the Bank is not subject to the same constraints on public sector pay. </p> <p>Until recently, civil service rules prevented the employment of non-UK nationals in Whitehall, but the government economic service - headed by the Treasury's chief economist, Gus O'Donnell - has spearheaded the drive for a more cosmopolitan approach. Overseas entrants are being offered three-year contracts. </p> <p>Mr O'Donnell said that there had been a rapid increase in the demand for microeconomists in government because departments were under pressure to meet quantified targets. </p> <p>He said the appeal of a job in the civil service for British graduates was not the pay but that of an interesting job and the acquisition of a highly marketable skill.</p>",

The Treasury said it was using publications such as the Economist and the Guardian to find economists, and was concentrating on countries with lower salaries than Britain to compensate for the increasing attraction to UK graduates of higher-paid jobs in the private sector. \"We don't get many Germans applying,\" said one senior official, \"because of the relative wage levels.\" Problems have become more acute over the past decade with the demand for economists in Whitehall up by 40% since 1989 but the supply has been shrinking as a result of the increased popularity of university business studies courses. Treasury sources admitted that the government is facing a classic economic problem of demand exceeding supply, but that they are prevented from solving it in the traditional way - by offering the salaries that will tempt sufficient graduates to work for the public sector. \"We are trying to push the price we are offering up,\" said one. \"We have increased salaries quite a bit, but we are still subject to the public spending envelope.\" A newly qualified economics graduate can expect to earn \u00a319,000 in Whitehall, with an additional \u00a32,500 for someone with a post-graduate qualification. Salaries at the Bank of England - which has expanded its contingent of economists since the formation of the monetary policy committee are around \u00a35,000 a year higher, because the Bank is not subject to the same constraints on public sector pay. Until recently, civil service rules prevented the employment of non-UK nationals in Whitehall, but the government economic service - headed by the Treasury's chief economist, Gus O'Donnell - has spearheaded the drive for a more cosmopolitan approach. Overseas entrants are being offered three-year contracts. Mr O'Donnell said that there had been a rapid increase in the demand for microeconomists in government because departments were under pressure to meet quantified targets. He said the appeal of a job in the civil service for British graduates was not the pay but that of an interesting job and the acquisition of a highly marketable skill.",

This should have calmed her down, but seemed to have the opposite effect, as Davenport returned to muse further on her plight like a child picking at a scab. In between these orgies of self-regard, Davenport pursued her day job as a wedding videographer, a career path as appropriate as putting an anorexic in charge of a pie shop.

On film, of course. </p> <p>We were left hoping that Nick might propose, if only to put an end to Davenport's navel-gazing.

Melvyn Bragg interviewed Martin with cheerful sycophancy, treating every utterance as sybilline. Amis seemed to enjoy the attention, peppered his answers with words like \"animus\" and \"recrudesce\" and was, as ever, charismatic and charming. Kingsley was much more fun, though - both in archive footage and in readings from his correspondence. \"Annoying people is part of one's life's work,\" he said, with a twinkle in his eye, and what a great job he did of it. Even Martin was riled. </p> <p>It was on the subject of marriage, though, that the sourest notes were sounded. Kingsley left his first wife, Hilary Bardwell, to marry novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard. Then, deciding that she was Satan in skirts, he went running back to a remarried Hilary, and ended his days in a companionable m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois. Martin has repeated some of the trick, and waxed rueful over the effect his divorce had on his own children. But for all Martin's elegance, it was Kingsley who rightfully stole the show, trotting out his ever-more absurd opinions (\"Women and queers and children cry when things go wrong\") and carrying on outrageously to the bitter end.</p>",

Amis seemed to enjoy the attention, peppered his answers with words like \"animus\" and \"recrudesce\" and was, as ever, charismatic and charming. Kingsley was much more fun, though - both in archive footage and in readings from his correspondence. \"Annoying people is part of one's life's work,\" he said, with a twinkle in his eye, and what a great job he did of it. Even Martin was riled. It was on the subject of marriage, though, that the sourest notes were sounded. Kingsley left his first wife, Hilary Bardwell, to marry novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard. Then, deciding that she was Satan in skirts, he went running back to a remarried Hilary, and ended his days in a companionable m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois. Martin has repeated some of the trick, and waxed rueful over the effect his divorce had on his own children. But for all Martin's elegance, it was Kingsley who rightfully stole the show, trotting out his ever-more absurd opinions (\"Women and queers and children cry when things go wrong\") and carrying on outrageously to the bitter end.",

Yesterday, Sierra Leone state radio insisted that the clash was a minor incident. \"The government wishes to assure the public that the incident was no threat to the security of the country,\" the station said. But many Sierra Leoneans saw the fighting as evidence of the instability of the government's military alliance and the worsening security situation since the British pulled out most of its combat force last week. UN peacekeepers stepped up patrols around Freetown yesterday amid reports of fresh clashes between pro-government factions close to the front line in the war against Revolutionary United Front rebels. Saturday's shooting apparently broke out after a soldier in the new Sierra Leone army tried to stop a member of the pro-government Kamajor militia from stealing tapes from a car. Within minutes dozens of fighters from both factions were firing, sending civilians in the street running for their lives. A driver was shot dead when his car was hit by bullets. Four other people were injured in the fighting. Two of them were Kamajor fighters who said they had been stabbed with bayonets. Thousands of people fled restaurants and bars for their homes, fearing that rebels had infiltrated the city. The government is relying heavily on a disparate collection of militias, private armies and fresh recruits to press the war against the RUF. The new Sierra Leone army, born of last year's peace accords, is still in its infancy. The British are training 1,000 new recruits but many of its officers are either inexperienced or tainted by a history of human rights abuses. The army has been recruiting heavily among members of the old military force which seized power twice during the 1990s until it was ousted by Nigerian troops who restored the elected government. Many of the soldiers loyal to the overthrown regime switched sides to fight with the RUF, committing atrocities by adopting the rebels' tactics of mutilations and rape to terrorise the civilian population. Some of those same troops are now fighting for the government under the command of the former military ruler, Johnny Paul Koroma. But while he has pledged his backing for President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah for now, Mr Koroma is known to be ambitious for greater power. The government is also relying on the Kamajor militia whose young fighters see copious quantities of gin and magic as more important to their success than training and tactics.

Its aim is \"to pick up the thread that was broken at the end of the 70s, the great heritage of research, ideas and utopias produced by the 60s\". That's a particularly tall order in Venice: the city has been in decline since the 18th century, and hasn't been a real, workaday place since the great flood of November 1966, which marked the beginning of a major international effort to conserve Venice and the end of the everyday life that \"la Serenissima\" once knew. From then on Venice was pickled in aspic, becoming a tourist ghetto and a place known equally for its aesthetics and its lack of ethics when it came to dealing with the millions of visitors who flooded into St Mark's Square every year. </p> <p>Yet when was Venice ever ethical? At the height of its power, it ruled an empire built on wily trade, commercial cunning and arcane banking. Not that any of this troubles you when you arrive in the dusty public gardens bordering the lagoon, and explore the delightfully eccentric Biennale pavilions. It's not so much a case of ethics be damned, or ignored; the Venice Biennale has long been a showcase of ideas far more than of buildings, and the real point of the exhibitions in the rival national pavilions is to outdo one another. </p> <p>The British Pavilion, organised by the British Council, is an enjoyable snapshot of one generation of British architects: born in the late 40s and early 50s, they have reached their stride and are undoubtedly good ambassadors for British architecture. They are Zaha Hadid, David Chipperfield, Will Alsop, and Nigel Coates and Doug Branson. The entire gang are graduates of the Architectural Association, London, and their range of work - ideas, provocations, models of work in progress - shows how talent nurtured in Britain has developed into the best kind of \"zuppa inglese\". </p> <p>While there is nothing trifling about the display in the British pavilion, it is immensely colourful, highly engaging and serious at the same time. At least some architects have learned to communicate, not through marketing and PR, but by creating images, making models and expressing ideas that are as involving as much contemporary installation art. If these are not as provocative as those of the Hirsts and Lucases of this world, it's because what's on show here are ideas for real buildings. </p> <p>The main room of the British pavilion is given over to a cartoon-like model of Will Alsop's design for C/plex, a public arts centre for West Bromwich. Alsop is the architect of the spirited new public library in Peckham, south-east London, a big character who likes to make a splash with challenging buildings that seem part amoeba, part mechanism. The C/plex model, a great burst of party balloon-like colours, is installed in a room painted by Alsop and slashed across with architect's slogans. It must have made culture secretary Chris Smith happy when he came for lunch, for rarely has the message of accessibility and art for all in the regions been more clearly spelt out - yet in a way that also appeals to those who believe that architecture should be more than just polite. </p> <p>Alsop's explosive style is echoed in the Ecstacity installation next door, a gloriously dynamic vision of what a city might be if only we stretched our imagination the Doug Branson and Nigel Coates way. In a beautifully installed wall of their own architectural models - miniatures blown in glass, buildings and the body zone from the Millennium Dome reduced to clever parodies of the kitsch souvenirs sold in Venetian tourist shops - Branson and Coates have plotted their spirited view of architecture on a giant city map. Theirs is an architecture of fantasy as well as reality, and here they have created a city that Italo Calvino would surely include in his book Invisible Cities, in which a fictional Marco Polo entertains the mighty Khan with tales of the fabulous and utterly unlikely cities he has visited. As Calvino says at one point in these imaginative narratives, he is always talking of Venice, a city that not even Coates and Branson could have invented. And Ecstacity, with its six related urban \"narratives\" - tuning in, locking on, undressing, letting go, cranking up and flipping out - is as much about Venice as it is about the city of the imagination that most of us long to live in. </p> <p>Zaha Hadid's contribution is a serpentine weaving and folding of recent projects. Again, this display reflects the labyrinthine nature of Venice, where the only thing expected is the unexpected. Hadid, Alsop, and Branson and Coates prove to be the very sort of architectural talent that Venice would do well by, should the city finally learn to reinvent itself and interrupt its long decline. </p> <p>David Chipperfield, whose clear-cut Modernism is as different from his co-biennalists' architecture as parmesan is from cheddar, is the only one of the gang with a live project in Venice. Well, dead, to be more accurate: Chipperfield is creating a new quarter in San Michele, the cemetery island whose bones and mathematical alleys haunt the Venetian lagoon, unknown in the living city close by. In a cool, white sepulchre of a room, Chipperfield, architect of the praised River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, shows fine models of the grand new buildings he's designing worldwide, including the ambitious Palace of Justice, Salerno. It seems strange that Chipperfield is the only one of the British biennalists designing for Venice. And yet Venice is as much the city of the geometric purity of Andrea Palladio as it is of the Baroque voluptuousness of Baldessare Longhena, architect of the sensuous Salute church, or of the tangle of alleyways from which not even a Greek hero with a ball of string could find his way out. </p> <p>The British Pavilion was put together quite late in the day. Whether serendipity or a cunning plan has won the day for the architectural ragazzi in Venice, it's impossible to say. Yet together Branson and Coates, Hadid and Alsop have brought a life to Venice that possibly only Venice truly understands, while Chipperfield brings life to the culture of death that has long shaped our dreams of this ineffable city.</p>",

      "body": "<p>To be in Brazil is to witness the present: Rio's brilliant white beaches flanked by skyscraper hotels, the traffic jams that snake along the big bay of Guanabara. But everywhere you hear, resoundingly, the voice of the past: in Salvador the demands of street-children whose faces are those of a people that has been robbed. </p> <p>And wherever you travel it is reiterated that Brazil is a nation of contrasts; not one single culture but an accretion of cultures. An old culture, forged from an unholy alliance between middle-class Portuguese gentlemen, indigenous Indians and Muslim slaves. And it has at its heart a strange tension - a stern loyalty to the past plus a need to tear up its histories. </p> <p>It is 500 years since Brazil was \"discovered\" by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral, who was blown off course on his way to the Orient. It is also just over 100 years since it abolished slavery, in 1888, the last nation in the western hemisphere to do so. More than an error of navigation this, it continues to mark the country deeply. </p> <p>Still, this year has been designated Brazil's cultural coming of age, and this summer begins a conscientious drive to reinterpret Brazil to the world through its major artists in all fields of the performing and visual arts. To bring us not the travel brochure Brazil, all football and carnival fan fare, but a Brazil in the words of dance artist Deborah Colker \"more expressive of the people's spirit\". </p> <p>Not a homogenised Brazil either. For as Colker points out, \"Brazilians take an almost tribal pride in being not only unlike the rest of Latin America but as unlike one another as it is possible to be.\" Take, for example, Dr Edemar Cid Ferreira, a short, stocky extremely wealthy banker who raised the $20m investment necessary to fund the Brazil 500 Rediscovery Exhibition of which he is president. </p> <p>This massive historical and cultural exhibition with over 15,000 exhibits is situated in Ibirapuera Park in Sao Paolo. All around the park are knots of impassioned kids skateboarding or playing music, whose cracked smiles reveal cracked teeth. Ferreira arrives stealthily, in a blacked-out Mercedes. One of the guides whispers that he is so rich he has been buying up the houses surrounding his mansion in Sao Paulo and now owns every one on the block. He doesn't want neighbours. </p> <p>His aim with the exhibition, Ferreira says, \"is to change the image of Brazil abroad and to give ourselves self-vision. To make a bridge between people here and a bridge with the world. It's a project.\" He doesn't care about the criticism that this is art as spectacle, as carnival. (Ferreira has \"dressed\" many of the exhibition spaces. There are fake fields of purple paper poppies.) </p> <p>It doesn't bear thinking about how many street kids could have been dressed with the money wasted on this paraphernalia designed to satisfy a rich man's vanity. Different aspects of the exhibition will find their way to Cambridge's Fitzwilliam, Oxford's Ashmolean and to the British Museum, plus museums in the US and Paris. </p> <p>But not, unfortunately, the part of the exhibition entitled Black in Body and Soul, which attempts to understand \"the struggles\" and the contribution of Africans to Brazilian culture, and to dispel what it calls \"the whitening\" of history. So, there is nothing blacker than the room full of instruments forged to torture slaves, or William Blake's 1793 engraving Negro Hanged Alive by a Rib. The exhibition anticipates receiving 600,000 schoolchildren as it travels around Brazil. From this Ferreira hopes they will understand the multiplicity of their origins, Brazil's \"transculturalism\" which is not \"multiculturalism\". And that they then will take a pride in their heritage. </p> <p>But this dry, arid strategy evoked by Ferreira, all to do with the grim imperatives of money, is eradicated by the freewheeling, bright, individual talents of the performing artists. For pure eccentricity, Grupo Giramundo, a family of third-generation puppeteers will bring their folk tale Cobra Narato to Riverside Studios in August. No money here - just an unadulterated love of the artform, a sense of the amazing that is conveyed to the audience who respond with amazement. </p> <p>Giramundo's theatre is a rundown warehouse in Belo Horizonte where they have been making their puppet art for 30 years. In their collection they have 800 puppets. The company originator and director, Alvaro Apocalypse, takes on a small number of young puppeteers each season and trains them in gaiety as much as in technique. Their work is a reminder that you can achieve every nuance of seriousness through lightheartedness - and, perhaps nothing without it. </p> <p>Cobra Narato experiments with every type of puppet from glove to marionettes moved by string to Chinese-inspired puppets moved by sticks or slides from the back, and is simply delightful. It works both with and against a myth of Brazil as a heritage of superstition and animistic beliefs. Its subject is nothing less than to try to discover the best means by which people can live together. </p> <p>Which is also the subject of Grupo Corpo's work, who, along with Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker, remain Brazil's leading contemporary dance company and who return to Britain for their second visit with two recent dance pieces, Benguele and Parabelo. Corpo's work is supple, a physical technique responsive to percussive influences, and based on traditional Brazilian movements to original music by Joao Bosco. Parabelo - which director Fernando Velloso translates as: \"If you want peace prepare for war\" - refers to the beneficent and destructive impulses alive in his contradictory country. As Velloso says: \"Here, the sun is so strong it can kill people like a gun. People die of the heat, they have no water. And yet the sun is beauty.\" </p> <p>The company has existed for 25 years and has reached the point where it can look outside Brazil for interpretations. Recently Corpo worked with the composer Philip Glass. \"We now have our own very strong character. It's a good time for us to show our work abroad. In terms of Brazil, the country is in transition. It may not be the perfect moment to celebrate and 500 years may not be the perfect anniversary. But we are not claiming Brazil is perfect. Just that there are positive things, wonderful things, and these should be celebrated.\" </p> <p><strong>Vacuum-packed salsa</strong></p> <p> Those banished from their country often become its voice. So with the 58-year-old Brazilian singer-songwriter, Caetano Veloso.

      "bodyText": "To be in Brazil is to witness the present: Rio's brilliant white beaches flanked by skyscraper hotels, the traffic jams that snake along the big bay of Guanabara. But everywhere you hear, resoundingly, the voice of the past: in Salvador the demands of street-children whose faces are those of a people that has been robbed. And wherever you travel it is reiterated that Brazil is a nation of contrasts; not one single culture but an accretion of cultures. An old culture, forged from an unholy alliance between middle-class Portuguese gentlemen, indigenous Indians and Muslim slaves. And it has at its heart a strange tension - a stern loyalty to the past plus a need to tear up its histories. It is 500 years since Brazil was \"discovered\" by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral, who was blown off course on his way to the Orient. It is also just over 100 years since it abolished slavery, in 1888, the last nation in the western hemisphere to do so. More than an error of navigation this, it continues to mark the country deeply. Still, this year has been designated Brazil's cultural coming of age, and this summer begins a conscientious drive to reinterpret Brazil to the world through its major artists in all fields of the performing and visual arts. To bring us not the travel brochure Brazil, all football and carnival fan fare, but a Brazil in the words of dance artist Deborah Colker \"more expressive of the people's spirit\". Not a homogenised Brazil either. For as Colker points out, \"Brazilians take an almost tribal pride in being not only unlike the rest of Latin America but as unlike one another as it is possible to be.\" Take, for example, Dr Edemar Cid Ferreira, a short, stocky extremely wealthy banker who raised the $20m investment necessary to fund the Brazil 500 Rediscovery Exhibition of which he is president. This massive historical and cultural exhibition with over 15,000 exhibits is situated in Ibirapuera Park in Sao Paolo. All around the park are knots of impassioned kids skateboarding or playing music, whose cracked smiles reveal cracked teeth. Ferreira arrives stealthily, in a blacked-out Mercedes. One of the guides whispers that he is so rich he has been buying up the houses surrounding his mansion in Sao Paulo and now owns every one on the block. He doesn't want neighbours. His aim with the exhibition, Ferreira says, \"is to change the image of Brazil abroad and to give ourselves self-vision. To make a bridge between people here and a bridge with the world. It's a project.\" He doesn't care about the criticism that this is art as spectacle, as carnival. (Ferreira has \"dressed\" many of the exhibition spaces. There are fake fields of purple paper poppies.) It doesn't bear thinking about how many street kids could have been dressed with the money wasted on this paraphernalia designed to satisfy a rich man's vanity. Different aspects of the exhibition will find their way to Cambridge's Fitzwilliam, Oxford's Ashmolean and to the British Museum, plus museums in the US and Paris. But not, unfortunately, the part of the exhibition entitled Black in Body and Soul, which attempts to understand \"the struggles\" and the contribution of Africans to Brazilian culture, and to dispel what it calls \"the whitening\" of history. So, there is nothing blacker than the room full of instruments forged to torture slaves, or William Blake's 1793 engraving Negro Hanged Alive by a Rib. The exhibition anticipates receiving 600,000 schoolchildren as it travels around Brazil. From this Ferreira hopes they will understand the multiplicity of their origins, Brazil's \"transculturalism\" which is not \"multiculturalism\". And that they then will take a pride in their heritage. But this dry, arid strategy evoked by Ferreira, all to do with the grim imperatives of money, is eradicated by the freewheeling, bright, individual talents of the performing artists. For pure eccentricity, Grupo Giramundo, a family of third-generation puppeteers will bring their folk tale Cobra Narato to Riverside Studios in August. No money here - just an unadulterated love of the artform, a sense of the amazing that is conveyed to the audience who respond with amazement. Giramundo's theatre is a rundown warehouse in Belo Horizonte where they have been making their puppet art for 30 years. In their collection they have 800 puppets. The company originator and director, Alvaro Apocalypse, takes on a small number of young puppeteers each season and trains them in gaiety as much as in technique. Their work is a reminder that you can achieve every nuance of seriousness through lightheartedness - and, perhaps nothing without it. Cobra Narato experiments with every type of puppet from glove to marionettes moved by string to Chinese-inspired puppets moved by sticks or slides from the back, and is simply delightful. It works both with and against a myth of Brazil as a heritage of superstition and animistic beliefs. Its subject is nothing less than to try to discover the best means by which people can live together. Which is also the subject of Grupo Corpo's work, who, along with Companhia de Danca Deborah Colker, remain Brazil's leading contemporary dance company and who return to Britain for their second visit with two recent dance pieces, Benguele and Parabelo. Corpo's work is supple, a physical technique responsive to percussive influences, and based on traditional Brazilian movements to original music by Joao Bosco. Parabelo - which director Fernando Velloso translates as: \"If you want peace prepare for war\" - refers to the beneficent and destructive impulses alive in his contradictory country. As Velloso says: \"Here, the sun is so strong it can kill people like a gun. People die of the heat, they have no water. And yet the sun is beauty.\" The company has existed for 25 years and has reached the point where it can look outside Brazil for interpretations. Recently Corpo worked with the composer Philip Glass. \"We now have our own very strong character. It's a good time for us to show our work abroad. In terms of Brazil, the country is in transition. It may not be the perfect moment to celebrate and 500 years may not be the perfect anniversary. But we are not claiming Brazil is perfect. Just that there are positive things, wonderful things, and these should be celebrated.\" Vacuum-packed salsa Those banished from their country often become its voice. So with the 58-year-old Brazilian singer-songwriter, Caetano Veloso. He was imprisoned in the late 60s for writing songs that expressed the counter-cultural spirit of the time, then spent a couple of years in exile in London before returning to a more politically relaxed Brazil. He has since become the bulwark of Brazilian music and culture, reflecting its past and working with new artists. An audience of enthusiastic expatriates and a smattering of Brits filled the Barbican for his show, which opened the Brasil: Brazil 500 festival. Caetano, in a stylish suit, swinging his acoustic guitar, walked on stage with elegant poise and an inviting smile. He looked 28 not 58, and supported this illusion with an energetic performance of full-on percussive pieces, glittering electric pop, samba, bossa nova and soft acoustic solos. His band - \"They are so talented and so sexy,\" he smiled - were so tight, the sound was almost vacuum-packed. Among the songs from his latest releases, Livro and the live recording Prenda Minha, were some wonderful interpretations of Brazilian classics. The band segued from a yearning performance of Jorge Ben's Jorge da Capadocia into the traditional Prenda Minha, where Caetano's falsetto warble twisted into Jobim's Meditacao. Terra, Caetano's own ballad of exile and love, saw the audience provide a spontaneous backing vocal, which he applauded. He then turned his mesmeric voice to London London, another song of exile, but written in English when he was here in 1970. Its chorus - \"while my eyes go looking for flying saucers in the skies\" - is glaring. He's a great lyricist, but something got lost in translation there.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Opera and Ballet is facing the appalling prospect of beginning the hunt for a new chief executive all over again, the poison chalice of the arts world. The friendly American, Michael Kaiser, who is regarded as having worked miracles in restoring shattered morale at Covent Garden, central London, has indicated that after one more season he will probably be moving on to a new challenge - almost certainly back in the US. \"There's no fight, no rift,\" a spokesman said yesterday. \"Michael was never going to stay forever. He has told us he is willing to stay for at least one more season, and then we'll all see. He isn't contracted to stay for any particular length of time.\" He took over at the end of 1998 at the lowest point in the history of the theatre, when Covent Garden had come to the edge of bankruptcy, and lost two chief executives in a year - one in bitter political infighting over her appointment, the other due to exhaustion caused by job stress. The management was hammered by the Commons culture committee, and the grant of almost \u00a380m in lottery funds, towards the \u00a3200m rebuilding of the complex, was one of the most unpopular ever made. The building work itself was dogged by disputes, delays, and threats of walkouts. From day one Mr Kaiser operated a policy of being nice to everyone, front stage, back stage and board room, even politicians and journalists. He weathered the inevitable storms around the reopening last December, which ranged from a row over seat prices - the dearest seats have become cheaper, but the cheapest seats with a decent view of the stage became much more expensive - to criticism of the allocation of seats at invitation-only previews, to a row over whether the black tie opening gala betrayed the ideal of making Covent Garden the people's opera. He also kept his cool, and insisted all would be well after inevitable teething problems, throughout the far greater embarrassment of the malfunctioning computerised set changing system, which led to a string of performances, and one entire opera, being cancelled. Now conditions have settled down - he has almost eliminated an inherited \u00a35m deficit, all the facilities are working and on the whole admired and Antonio Pappano and Ross Stretton chosen as popular new directors for the opera and ballet - the word from insiders is that Mr Kaiser is growing restless. Some say he is disappointed with his reception in London, and that there have been personality clashes with Covent Garden's acerbic chairman Sir Colin Southgate. Others insist he saw reopening the opera house as the challenge, but never viewed it as a job for life. If he leaves next spring, as reported, his departure would coincide with that of the formidable Vivien Duffield, who raised \u00a350m towards the rebuilding, was made a dame on Saturday, and is retiring from the board.

      "bodyText": "The Post Office was last night threatened with industrial action over a proposal to use a private company to handle international mail leaving Britain. Confidential talks have taken place with the privately-owned Dutch postal service that could result in it sorting and carrying millions of letters posted in Britain to addresses abroad. A senior manager disclosed that under the plan the Dutch service, now run by the courier company TNT, would handle a proportion of international mail at its own depot. The proposal was denounced as \"backdoor privatisation\" by furious union leaders who are to seek an urgent meeting with Post Office directors and will press Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, to halt the scheme. Details emerged at a sensitive time for the Post Office. It is due to report its first loss for almost 25 years later today. It is also in delicate negotiations over plans to shift 1,500 jobs out of central London's Mount Pleasant sorting office and seek union agreement on staffing a new international complex to open next year at Langley near Heathrow. Union leaders threatened industrial action to stop a deal that would for the first time give a private firm responsibility for Royal Mail post. John Keggie, CWU deputy general secretary, said: \"We will not allow work to be handed to a competitor. We recognise commercial freedom has put us in a different environment but that does not mean handing over the family silver to a rival.\" Discussions between John Mod, managing director of Royal Mail's international division, and the Dutch post office are understood to be at an advanced stage;one insider claimed a draft agreement had been signed. The British, Dutch and Singapore post offices announced an alliance earlier this year to win new business around the world in the face of fierce German and US competition. The Post Office yesterday insisted no deal had been signed to involve the Dutch company in the UK postal system. But an industry source maintained that under the proposal the Dutch TNT Post Group would win a share of the letters leaving Britain once it had proved it could do so more cheaply than Langley. The Post Office is expected to announce today a deficit of around \u00a3250m in the year to the end of March. Industry sources blame the government's decision to pay state benefits directly into bank and building society accounts - rather than over post office counters - for the slide into the red. The change is thought to have cost some \u00a3400m in revenue last year and meant that the Post Office had to write off \u00a3571m of a \u00a31bn investment project for counter services automation. Though the Post Office would have made money without the write-off, today's figures are expected to show a downward trend in its profits reflecting growing competition as well as the loss of revenue from benefit payments. There are fears for the future of many post offices, especially those in rural and inner city areas. Only 600 post offices are directly run by the Post Office directly. The remainder are run by sub postmasters, most of whom own the businesses and are paid for the services they provide. Some 8,000 are said to be making losses and are being subsidised by the Post Office.",

      "body": "<p>Denis Winston Healey, poet, photographer, highbrow thug, has called people a lot of names over the years. Thatcher: \"Virago intacta\", \"la Pasionaria of privilege\" or \"That bloody woman\". Hurd: \"A tattered Talleyrand\"; Howe: \"a dead sheep\". Even Prescott, he once said, had the face of a man \"who clubs baby seals\". Today, we're just settling for \"dear\". \"Come off it, dear,\" he says when once he might have hollered \"silly bugger\". \"Hurry up, dear,\" he says, never before a stranger to the \"sod off\".</p> <p>Thank God, then, for the pigeon. We meet on the terrace at the House of Lords where the crumbs of a previous collation are causing some feathered excitement. One pigeon lands briefly on my head. Healey, who has been sitting immobile like an old cat missing a few teeth, bored and indifferent to the mice frolicking at his feet, opens his red-rimmed blue eyes a little wider. \"I asked him to come along,\" he says, eyebrows twitching like antennae. \"I said, 'I've got a bird out here who needs going over.' \"</p> <p>Ostensibly, we have met to discuss Labour and the single European currency. Lord Healey, a member of David Owen's New Europe group, left his Sussex garden recently to speak out, along with Nigel Lawson - \"of all people\" - against joining. He's been on Sky the day before this interview, \"though you get paid for that\". He's always been pro-Europe, anti-euro, \"and my views have just been confirmed by what's happened and I'm always interested when you get someone like Eddie George saying it's a mistake\". But he won't be drawn any more than that, won't discuss the ferrets fighting in a bag, apart from to say that Hague stole that phrase from someone, \"probably from me\".</p> <p>\"It's a boring subject,\" he says. And as for being involved in the New Europe group and its \"hard-hitting\" white paper: \"I say 'involved'... I just supported the thing which I suppose David probably wrote.\"</p> <p>He thought, he adds, that the interview was to be about \"this sudden interest in aged obesity\". After spells of gout and diabetes, he has recently lost weight. There is still a sizeable stomach under the jacket of his shiny blue suit, but there is a empty envelope of skin between his neck and his chin. \"Do you want my clothes off?\" he says. I tell him he's attained the status of statesman. He says he hasn't. \"A statesman is a dead politician.\" What are you then? \"I'm in the home of the living dead which is betwixt and between. The House of Lords.\" And he laughs, but his face hardly moves.</p> <p>He is 82 now and it is eight years since the politician believed by many to be the great Labour leader we never had - \"brilliant and brutal\" in the words of the Guardian's Hugo Young - gave up his seat as MP for Leeds East. He vacated his last cabinet post, as opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, in 1987. It is 21 years since he was active in government, as chancellor of the exchequer at the time of Margaret Thatcher's 79 election victory. It is even 11 years since he wrote his bestselling autobiography, The Time of My Life, a work which earned him \u00a3150,000 and which he refers you back to at intervals as if all activity stopped there. It is a long time to hang out in your hinterland and, Healeys living as long as they do (his father died at 92, his mother at 99), there is more time to come.</p> <p>Does he enjoy retirement? \"I enjoy my retirement, I don't particularly enjoy being retired, if you see what I mean. But I'm quite active. I'm reading Charlotte Bront\u00eb at the moment. I have my garden, my photography. I paint a bit, though none of my pictures are worth much. Occasionally I even talk to young ladies who work on newspapers.\" He enjoys the Lords, thinks Margaret Jay is \"a very able woman, very attractive too\". He stops a passing Norman Lamont for a chat. \"This is just like a club really,\" he says after Lamont has gone, \"much nicer, much less party than the Commons.\" So he doesn't watch the goings-on next door with his fingers twitching? \"No,\" he says shortly. \"The only point of being a politician is to do things, not just to talk about them.\"</p> <p>He calls the Blair, Brown, Prescott triumvirate the \"Holy Trinity\". \"They're a perfect mix, really.

Brown has a very powerful mind and I think he's a very good chancellor, and a prime minister who doesn't have a good chancellor is finished.\" He was a \"pretty good\" chancellor himself, he adds, though everybody in the party hated him \"because you have to deny them all the time\" and there was that spot of bother with the IMF.</p> <p>\"That was the most tiring time I ever had, negotiating what I thought were the most lenient conditions and then trying to get your cabinet colleagues to agree when they don't regard them as lenient. But it's a very different world now. Very different economy. We are no longer one of the world's three great powers.

Tony loves travel. He loves culture, too, in a sense, otherwise he wouldn't be so interested in Italy. But it's a busier job now, so much faster...\" There are fewer jokes, too, he says, far fewer people being savaged by dead sheep, or nuzzled by old rams.</p> <p>\"Disraeli made brilliant jokes and humour and wit have always played a major role in politics. You see it in Trollope. There are many quotes from him.... they're in my book. But now you don't get people deliberately making people laugh.

I hardly know Alastair Campbell but I have a great sympathy for him because he spent some of his childhood at Keighley where I was brought up.</p> <p>\"One thing is still the same,\" he goes on sternly. \"There has always been a tradition of thinking that politicians are nastier than other people. But in my experience - and I have lived in many different worlds, politics, the arts, contact with the church though I'm not a believing Christian - at the top of any profession you have exactly the same kind of jungle war.

When people are competing for fame or position, then it's a jungle war.\"</p> <p>Next week, Lord Healey and Edna, his wife of 55 years, are off to Greece on a freebie. Healey has to go to a meeting in Thessalonika - \"Oh, it'll be about everything that is happening in the world with a lot of Europeans, Americans, Japanese and Arabs, that sort of thing.\" He's not being paid, which galls a little. \"In the old days I used to get \u00a35,000 a time.

      "bodyText": "Denis Winston Healey, poet, photographer, highbrow thug, has called people a lot of names over the years. Thatcher: \"Virago intacta\", \"la Pasionaria of privilege\" or \"That bloody woman\". Hurd: \"A tattered Talleyrand\"; Howe: \"a dead sheep\". Even Prescott, he once said, had the face of a man \"who clubs baby seals\". Today, we're just settling for \"dear\". \"Come off it, dear,\" he says when once he might have hollered \"silly bugger\". \"Hurry up, dear,\" he says, never before a stranger to the \"sod off\". Thank God, then, for the pigeon. We meet on the terrace at the House of Lords where the crumbs of a previous collation are causing some feathered excitement. One pigeon lands briefly on my head. Healey, who has been sitting immobile like an old cat missing a few teeth, bored and indifferent to the mice frolicking at his feet, opens his red-rimmed blue eyes a little wider. \"I asked him to come along,\" he says, eyebrows twitching like antennae. \"I said, 'I've got a bird out here who needs going over.' \" Ostensibly, we have met to discuss Labour and the single European currency. Lord Healey, a member of David Owen's New Europe group, left his Sussex garden recently to speak out, along with Nigel Lawson - \"of all people\" - against joining. He's been on Sky the day before this interview, \"though you get paid for that\". He's always been pro-Europe, anti-euro, \"and my views have just been confirmed by what's happened and I'm always interested when you get someone like Eddie George saying it's a mistake\". But he won't be drawn any more than that, won't discuss the ferrets fighting in a bag, apart from to say that Hague stole that phrase from someone, \"probably from me\". \"It's a boring subject,\" he says. And as for being involved in the New Europe group and its \"hard-hitting\" white paper: \"I say 'involved'... I just supported the thing which I suppose David probably wrote.\" He thought, he adds, that the interview was to be about \"this sudden interest in aged obesity\". After spells of gout and diabetes, he has recently lost weight. There is still a sizeable stomach under the jacket of his shiny blue suit, but there is a empty envelope of skin between his neck and his chin. \"Do you want my clothes off?\" he says. I tell him he's attained the status of statesman. He says he hasn't. \"A statesman is a dead politician.\" What are you then? \"I'm in the home of the living dead which is betwixt and between. The House of Lords.\" And he laughs, but his face hardly moves. He is 82 now and it is eight years since the politician believed by many to be the great Labour leader we never had - \"brilliant and brutal\" in the words of the Guardian's Hugo Young - gave up his seat as MP for Leeds East. He vacated his last cabinet post, as opposition spokesman for foreign affairs, in 1987. It is 21 years since he was active in government, as chancellor of the exchequer at the time of Margaret Thatcher's 79 election victory. It is even 11 years since he wrote his bestselling autobiography, The Time of My Life, a work which earned him \u00a3150,000 and which he refers you back to at intervals as if all activity stopped there. It is a long time to hang out in your hinterland and, Healeys living as long as they do (his father died at 92, his mother at 99), there is more time to come. Does he enjoy retirement? \"I enjoy my retirement, I don't particularly enjoy being retired, if you see what I mean. But I'm quite active. I'm reading Charlotte Bront\u00eb at the moment. I have my garden, my photography. I paint a bit, though none of my pictures are worth much. Occasionally I even talk to young ladies who work on newspapers.\" He enjoys the Lords, thinks Margaret Jay is \"a very able woman, very attractive too\". He stops a passing Norman Lamont for a chat. \"This is just like a club really,\" he says after Lamont has gone, \"much nicer, much less party than the Commons.\" So he doesn't watch the goings-on next door with his fingers twitching? \"No,\" he says shortly. \"The only point of being a politician is to do things, not just to talk about them.\" He calls the Blair, Brown, Prescott triumvirate the \"Holy Trinity\". \"They're a perfect mix, really.

A joint project between doctors and physicists in Leeds is close to perfecting a do-it-yourself monitor of the changes in electrical impulses that show labour is imminent. A prototype hand-held device has passed trials on women approaching full term, giving accurate forecasts within a two-day period before birth. Extended trials are under way with the aim of producing a monitor which is reliable for up to a fortnight before the onset of labour. The longer-term target is an affordable device -about the size of a personal stereo - which would be available over the counter and simple enough to use without help from a doctor or midwife. Non-invasive, it would record electrical impulses from outside the body. The team behind its development think that it will be another year or two before such a device is ready. \"All our data to date indicates that labour is a predictable event,\" said Nigel Simpson of Leeds medical school, a body linking Leeds University, the general infirmary and St James's hospitals. \"Giving women more knowledge as to when it is about to happen empowers them.\" The system has been developed following a decision by the Leeds specialists to strike out in a new direction from traditional, and often haphazard, attempts at predicting the onset of labour. These have relied on monitoring simpler physical changes in the body or biochemical tests. Both systems have a much greater likelihood of requiring women to see GPs or go into hospital early for what may prove false alarms. Dr Simpson, who is based at the infirmary, and James Walker of St James's, spent a year looking at electrical data after success monitoring other parts of the body. \"Just as an electrocardiogram works by sensing electrical activity in the heart, this approach measures uterine electrical activity, which changes significantly ahead of the onset of labour,\" Dr Simpson said. The prototype monitor uses software which has to be linked to a personal computer - but the project team is confident that a much smaller version is within reach. Electrocardiograms have come within the reach of lay users in recent years, notably through emergency systems designed for mountain and offshore rescue teams. Volunteers in the Lake District regularly use machines which are linked by modem to local hospitals to monitor the condition and treatment of heart-attack casualties on the fells before they reach hospital.",

True, there is a swimming pool, sports pitches and arts centre in the former school - which paradoxically some local people also resent - and Kaleidoscope plans to run a minibus to Bristol, Bridgwater and Nether Stowey.

It is also a very small community in which to place a relatively large group of people. But then Over Stowey has already shown that it can cope with this. The idea that it has been a haven of pure, lily-white Englishness is bogus, not the asylum seekers. The Lodge used to be a private school that took in a large number of Hong Kong Chinese. But they were wealthy and not, at the time, national hate figures.</p> <p>There is little doubt that the arrival of asylum seekers will change Over Stowey and the surrounding area. The trouble is the automatic presumption that it will change for the worse, the notion that all that 74 people from different parts of the globe can bring to a small, ageing, rural area is crime and destitution, that an area where black people are still to be stared at has nothing to learn about the modern world.</p> <p>Not everyone in the area believes that.

His body was found at his mansion on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, which he had bought in December for $25m.</p> <p>Bulldozing the properties adjoining his previous $20m Beverly Hills mansion had brought him into conflict with neighbours, as had his application for exemption from height restrictions for the $50m \"Mediterranean-style villa\" he wanted to build in Benedict Canyon.</p> <p>But Hughes's main troubles concerned the firm he founded in Beverly Hills at the age of 24, Herbalife International, described in 1997 by Forbes business magazine as selling dubious elixirs for weight reduction and nutrition. Herbalife was the subject of complaints almost from the first month, in which it sold $23,000 of powders and potions, building to $2m by the year's end and to $500m annually five years later.</p> <p>During the next few years the firm was formally criticised at least three times by the United States Food and Drugs Administration, and subject to a CNN television expos\u00e9, a senate investigative committee inquiry, denunciations from a medical watchdog organisation and an $850,000 penalty payment imposed by the California attorney general for making false medical claims and marketing an illegal pyramid sales scheme. This recruited 750,000 \"distributors\" in what Hughes claimed were 48 countries, including Britain.</p> <p>Through it all Hughes maintained a cherubic smile, and his web site included cheery messages exhorting customers to buy more and promising fortunes. But finding an address or a telephone number for corporate headquarters was impossible.</p> <p>He said he had founded the firm to \"devote his life to improving people's health\" because his mother had died when he was 18 from a drug used to lose weight. In fact, her death was caused by an addiction to amphetamine.</p> <p>As for the \"natural\" ingredients Hughes claimed were the basis of his products, some were at various times judged to be toxic, and at other times carcinogenic. The PhD whom he promoted as his original scientific adviser had bought his degree from a correspondence school, and the research laboratory the advertisements boasted of was exposed by CNN as a conference room table loaded with books about herbs. Hughes had abandoned his schooling aged 14. He then spent three years in a residence for troubled youths.</p> <p>At the senate inquiry, Hughes arrived with an entourage and another (genuine) PhD, who had to admit that he had been hired only when Hughes received a subpoena. Hughes hit back at the senators' scientific advisers by saying: \"If they're such experts, why are they so fat? I've lost 16 pounds in the last few years on my products.\"</p> <p>The FDA formally warned Herbalife for mislabelling, making false health claims, and engendering too many complaints from users. Forbes later reported that with such pyramid schemes, initially impressive sales always faltered, and when this happened to Herbalife in the US, he turned to suckers abroad until over three quarters of his business was in foreign countries.</p> <p>Last autumn, as the firm's share price fell to $12, Hughes announced he would buy all the outstanding shares for $17 each. He increased this to $17.81 in January after shareholders sued him, but in April withdrew the offer when the shares collapsed to $4. Just before his death they traded at $10.</p> <p>He was married three times. In 1997 he announced that he and his third wife Suzan, a former Miss Petite America, were separating.</p> <p>\u0095 Mark Reynolds Hughes, health products purveyor, born January 1 1956; died May 21 2000</p>",

During the next few years the firm was formally criticised at least three times by the United States Food and Drugs Administration, and subject to a CNN television expos\u00e9, a senate investigative committee inquiry, denunciations from a medical watchdog organisation and an $850,000 penalty payment imposed by the California attorney general for making false medical claims and marketing an illegal pyramid sales scheme. This recruited 750,000 \"distributors\" in what Hughes claimed were 48 countries, including Britain. Through it all Hughes maintained a cherubic smile, and his web site included cheery messages exhorting customers to buy more and promising fortunes. But finding an address or a telephone number for corporate headquarters was impossible. He said he had founded the firm to \"devote his life to improving people's health\" because his mother had died when he was 18 from a drug used to lose weight. In fact, her death was caused by an addiction to amphetamine. As for the \"natural\" ingredients Hughes claimed were the basis of his products, some were at various times judged to be toxic, and at other times carcinogenic. The PhD whom he promoted as his original scientific adviser had bought his degree from a correspondence school, and the research laboratory the advertisements boasted of was exposed by CNN as a conference room table loaded with books about herbs. Hughes had abandoned his schooling aged 14. He then spent three years in a residence for troubled youths. At the senate inquiry, Hughes arrived with an entourage and another (genuine) PhD, who had to admit that he had been hired only when Hughes received a subpoena. Hughes hit back at the senators' scientific advisers by saying: \"If they're such experts, why are they so fat? I've lost 16 pounds in the last few years on my products.\" The FDA formally warned Herbalife for mislabelling, making false health claims, and engendering too many complaints from users. Forbes later reported that with such pyramid schemes, initially impressive sales always faltered, and when this happened to Herbalife in the US, he turned to suckers abroad until over three quarters of his business was in foreign countries. Last autumn, as the firm's share price fell to $12, Hughes announced he would buy all the outstanding shares for $17 each. He increased this to $17.81 in January after shareholders sued him, but in April withdrew the offer when the shares collapsed to $4. Just before his death they traded at $10. He was married three times. In 1997 he announced that he and his third wife Suzan, a former Miss Petite America, were separating. \u0095 Mark Reynolds Hughes, health products purveyor, born January 1 1956; died May 21 2000",

Mind you, their overblown confidence did make their disappointed wee faces on Monday night even sweeter. Roll on the penalty shoot outs! Neil Macdonald Macclesfield, Cheshire \u0095 Your correspondents are deluding themselves if they imagine it is only the Scots who enjoy seeing England lose. I have yet to meet a Welsh, Irish, or even Australian person who does not feel the same way. Alastair Greig Haworth, West Yorks alastair.greig@virgin.com",

      "bodyText": "Pakistan's military rulers yesterday warned that they would enforce a new, broad tax regime despite widespread opposition in a country where tax evasion has become a national pastime. Wealthy farmers, many of whom still run their businesses under a feudal system, will have to pay tax this year for the first time. Just 1.8m of Pakistan's 135m population pays tax. Already the generals are locked in a bitter row with shopkeepers and traders who led a strike earlier this month against a survey of their well-hidden incomes and the imposition of a retail sales tax. The powerful Islamic religious parties backed the strike and threaten to undermine the military's efforts to reform the economy and unlock international aid. \"No country can prosper whose citizens acquire wealth and income non-transparently,\" said the finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, in a television address as he announced the budget for the coming year. \"Every citizen must share the cost of governance by paying a share of his income,\" added Mr Aziz, a widely-respected banker and former Citibank executive. But he stopped short of setting a rate for the new agricultural tax, saying that would be decided by Pakistan's four provincial governments. Since seizing power in a coup last October, the army head and chief executive of the government, General Pervez Musharraf, has had to put an economic recovery at the top of his agenda. Pakistan's sickly economy came close to sliding into bankruptcy last year, and more than half the government's spending is still swallowed up in interest payments on its colossal foreign debt. Defence spending takes up the next largest slice, leaving little room for development work. As a result the number of people living below the poverty line has more than doubled in the past decade to 44m. Widening the tax burden would help meet the demands of lenders such as the International Monetary Fund, which has frozen credit since the coup. But it is certain to ignite opposition across the country. Traders and shopkeepers closed down their businesses for two weeks in protest at the proposed new taxes, arguing that they would be forced to pay bribes to corrupt tax officials. Although most of them have now returned to work after the military met some of their demands, the confrontation has been postponed but not resolved. The influential Islamic party, Jamaat-i-Islami, has also come out against the new taxes. \"This budget will increase the misery of the common man,\" said Ghafoor Ahmed, a Jamaat leader, yesterday. \"The government will face opposition from the agricultural community. \"Life has become more costly and the government is giving no security of jobs or of property. There is no welfare state. Most of the money is spent on debt servicing and defence, not on health or education or welfare. We should stop taking these foreign loans.\" Gen Musharraf may not be able to risk angering the Islamists. Already he has backed down on changes to Pakistan's much-criticised blasphemy law because of opposition from the Islamic parties, and he is now coming under pressure to switch the weekly holiday from Sunday back to Friday. And under the terms of a supreme court ruling announced early this year, Gen Musharraf must make Pakistan's economy completely free from interest charges under an Islamic banking system by next year. In the budget, the military also raised defence spending by 11% to 159.6bn rupees (\u00a32bn) for this year. That still falls well short of India's defence budget, which New Delhi has increased by 28% to \u00a38.4bn. \"We do not want an arms race with India but it is necessary to maintain a credible defence,\" said Mr Aziz.",

      "bodyText": "Tourists arriving at the Interlude camp site near the Atlantic port of La Rochelle are faced with what looks like an outdoor modern art exhibition. Odd-shaped, sand-coloured sails, with yacht-style rigging, have been scattered through the seaside site alongside the local pines. \"They really represent missing trees,\" the owner, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mainaud, said. \"Three hundred of the 1,000 trees on the camp-site were swept away in the December storm. The sails will compensate for the lost shade, but unfortunately there is not much we can do about a more damaging image problem.\" Even more than the storm, the site on the Ile de R\u00e9, one of France's top Atlantic vacation destinations, is suffering from the oil slick from the sunken tanker, Erika, even though it is more than 100 miles from where the ship went down in the worst storm in living memory last Christmas. \"Only a few drops of oil reached La Rochelle but for foreigners the Atlantic coastline is all one piece, whether it's Britanny or Aquitaine,\" the Ile de R\u00e9 tourist director, Catherine Senand, said. The Ile de R\u00e9 is in Charente-Maritime d\u00e9partement, which is squeezed between the better-known Vend\u00e9e to the north and Bordeaux's wine areas to the south. It has long been a favourite of the British, who account for 5% of the 3.5m summer holidaymakers strung along 100 miles of beach and more than 400 camping sites. But adverse publicity over Erika and the destructive winter storm has cut bookings across an accommodation range dominated by camping sites that are now investing in hundreds of sails to create shade. \"The French know the local geography better and we will be packed out in July and August but we haven't stopped the drift of British, Germans and Dutch whom we depend on in spring and autumn,\" said Thiery Bouet, the Charente-Maritime tourist director. Anxiety is likely to increase over the next few days following an official decision to close at least 11 beaches in Britanny and the Vend\u00e9e because the damage caused by Erika has not yet been cleared up. Concern over an oil slick which has not yet sullied the Charente-Maritime has at least deflected attention from lasting damage caused by the December 27 storm, in which 90mph winds killed more than 70 people across France and felled 10m trees. The zone around the fortified port of La Rochelle took the full blow, tearing off roofs, causing floods, beaching more than 350 boats, destroying sand dunes and carrying so much salt air inland that trees which appeared untouched by the wind have withered and died. \"Much of the damage has been repaired with the help of workers sent from all over Europe but there is a still a titanic job ahead to clear devastated forests,\" the d\u00e9partement's council chairman, Claude Belot, said. The worst shock was to the Charente-Maritime's \u00a3120m-a-year oyster industry, where one sixth of the 60,000-tonne harvest was destroyed. Growers, some of whom lost two years' production, are awaiting \u00a311m compensation. France's passion for oysters has seen a marked decline since the oil slick, caused by fears about quality. Marc Texier, a third-generation grower on the Ile d'Ol\u00e9ron, south of La Rochelle, said the crisis could hasten the drift of growers away from a food industry started by the Romans that employs 7,000 workers. \"It takes four years to raise oysters for the market and growers are lucky if they receive the minimum wage (about \u00a3600 a month) for a 70-hour week. \"Seeing so much work swept away by the storm will dishearten many who can't afford to repair damage to warehouses,\" Mr Texier said.",

      "body": "<p>The game of snakes and ladders continues. No sooner had England climbed the rungs against Zimbabwe than they came slithering down a giant anaconda at Edgbaston. </p> <p>The debriefing meeting yesterday in the team's hotel - round about the time the fourth day's play should have been starting - must have made unpleasant listening. </p> <p>England came out of the match with few plus points, although Nasser Hussain's assertion that those extended no further than Darren Gough is harsh on Mike Atherton, who for two hours on Saturday batted against Courtney Walsh and in particular Curtly Ambrose about as well as was humanly possible in the conditions. Nick Knight too top-scored in both innings, although as five West Indians managed more in their single innings than he had in both of England's it is best not to pursue that too far. </p> <p>Already there have been the usual knee-jerk calls for wholesale changes, which is just nonsense. This is one match, at a venue which consistently poses unique problems. </p> <p>Last summer in Birmingham, for instance, New Zealand lost inside three days and went on to win the series. And five years ago West Indies won the opening match of the summer at Headingley by nine wickets, but England came back and won the next at Lord's by 72 runs. </p> <p>Came the following match at Edgbaston and, on a pitch little short of scandalous, England suffered greater traumas than ever they did over the past few days, losing by an innings and 64 runs before lunch on the third day - bowled out for 147 and 89 in 74.2 overs. Their response was to go to Old Trafford and square the series again. </p> <p>Both teams know the one-off nature of test cricket at Edgbaston. As this match was drawing to its conclusion, Viv Richards was asked whether a losing side should be changed. His response was that, unless the conditions demand it, you should offer those who lost a match the chance to redeem themselves in the next. Only if they fail do you then consider moving on. </p> <p>It is sound thinking and it would fly in the face of a policy of continuity started last winter if, say, Mark Ramprakash was not given an extended chance to learn the opener's role or Graeme Hick was jettisoned because of his pair in this game. </p> <p>In the scheme of things, this was a match that England were never going to win after it became apparent what type of surface had been prepared. Once there is variable bounce then it is the tall bowlers, who deliver at pace but do not compromise on accuracy, who will prosper. Walsh and Ambrose, in other words. </p> <p>In the first innings, when it was damp and the movement was lateral off the seam, they pursued a relentless line just outside off stump and a rigid length to a ring of close catchers. In the second innings, where the variable bounce was the key factor, they bowled straight and the dismissals reflected as much. </p> <p>Whatever the conditions, however, there is no great secret to the success: the more straight throws the greater the chance of a coconut. England's batsmen did play some poor shots at times, and others received balls that were unplayable or batted as if expecting one. Each performance needs to be placed in context. </p> <p>Consider Hussain, who in the second innings managed successive boundaries to third man off Ambrose from near identical deliveries by splicing the first through the hands of first slip as the ball rose sharply and toe-ending the second as it shot along the deck. It is hard to be pragmatic in such circumstances. </p> <p>And look at Atherton, who had been given absolutely nothing hittable for two hours and knows that when a bad ball comes from a change bowler he has no option but to go for it irrespective of the variable bounce. He chopped on to his stumps. You do not condemn batsmen who encounter truly great bowlers on a surface as capricious as this. </p> <p>Chastise the bowling, though, because, Gough and perhaps Andy Flintoff apart, it did not come close to matching West Indies' for accuracy, skill or sense of purpose. It allowed the tourists to escape from 136 for four, when Brian Lara's wicket fell and England were still in the match, to make 397. </p> <p>And reserve contempt for a groundsman who yet again has produced a pitch that failed abysmally to meet the requirements of international cricket. This one was not dry at the start, apparently because of the wet weather on Wednesday. Well, poppycock: the pitch should have been dry already and ready to play a day early. One suspects it is kept damp deliberately to prevent it cracking too early. </p> <p>The Warwickshire club are culpable and must be told that matches will be taken elsewhere if they cannot do better that this. Along with the game, a full house was lost yesterday and with it upwards of \u00a3500,000. English cricket can afford neither. </p> <p><strong>Scoreboard</strong> </p> <p> <strong> ENGLAND </strong> <strong> First innings </strong></p> <p><strong>M A Atherton</strong> c Jacobs b Walsh <strong> 20</strong> </p> <p> Pushed at jagging delivery 82mins 51 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> M R Ramprakash</strong> c Hinds b Walsh <strong> 18</strong> </p> <p> Inside edge on to pad to short leg 61mins 48 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> *N Hussain</strong> c Jacobs b Rose <strong> 15</strong> </p> <p> Gloved, trying to withdraw 121mins 82 balls 2 fours </p> <p><strong> G A Hick</strong> c Campbell b Walsh <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p> Knocked on from third slip to second 9mins 6 balls </p> <p><strong> A J Stewart</strong> b Ambrose <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p> Inside edge on to stumps 39mins 25 balls </p> <p><strong> N V Knight</strong> c Lara b King <strong> 26</strong> </p> <p> Edged drive at short ball to first slip 84mins 56 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> A Flintoff</strong> c Lara b Walsh <strong> 16</strong> </p> <p> Angled push to first slip 40mins 20 balls 3 fours </p> <p><strong> R D B Croft</strong> c Jacobs b Walsh <strong> 18</strong> </p> <p> Edged delivery that held up 32mins 19 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> A R Caddick</strong> not out <strong> 21</strong> </p> <p> 94mins 67 balls </p> <p><strong> D Gough</strong> run out <strong> 23</strong> </p> <p> Hesitated over leg-bye to wicketkeeper 50mins 36 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> E S H Giddins</strong> c Jacobs b King <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p> Skied ambitious hook 14mins 11 balls </p> <p><strong> Extras</strong> (lb6, w1, nb9) <strong> 16 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (69 overs) <strong> 179 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 26, 44, 45, 57, 82, 112, 112, 134, 173. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Ambrose 20.5-10-32-1;

It is sound thinking and it would fly in the face of a policy of continuity started last winter if, say, Mark Ramprakash was not given an extended chance to learn the opener's role or Graeme Hick was jettisoned because of his pair in this game. In the scheme of things, this was a match that England were never going to win after it became apparent what type of surface had been prepared. Once there is variable bounce then it is the tall bowlers, who deliver at pace but do not compromise on accuracy, who will prosper. Walsh and Ambrose, in other words. In the first innings, when it was damp and the movement was lateral off the seam, they pursued a relentless line just outside off stump and a rigid length to a ring of close catchers. In the second innings, where the variable bounce was the key factor, they bowled straight and the dismissals reflected as much. Whatever the conditions, however, there is no great secret to the success: the more straight throws the greater the chance of a coconut. England's batsmen did play some poor shots at times, and others received balls that were unplayable or batted as if expecting one. Each performance needs to be placed in context. Consider Hussain, who in the second innings managed successive boundaries to third man off Ambrose from near identical deliveries by splicing the first through the hands of first slip as the ball rose sharply and toe-ending the second as it shot along the deck. It is hard to be pragmatic in such circumstances. And look at Atherton, who had been given absolutely nothing hittable for two hours and knows that when a bad ball comes from a change bowler he has no option but to go for it irrespective of the variable bounce. He chopped on to his stumps. You do not condemn batsmen who encounter truly great bowlers on a surface as capricious as this. Chastise the bowling, though, because, Gough and perhaps Andy Flintoff apart, it did not come close to matching West Indies' for accuracy, skill or sense of purpose. It allowed the tourists to escape from 136 for four, when Brian Lara's wicket fell and England were still in the match, to make 397. And reserve contempt for a groundsman who yet again has produced a pitch that failed abysmally to meet the requirements of international cricket. This one was not dry at the start, apparently because of the wet weather on Wednesday. Well, poppycock: the pitch should have been dry already and ready to play a day early. One suspects it is kept damp deliberately to prevent it cracking too early. The Warwickshire club are culpable and must be told that matches will be taken elsewhere if they cannot do better that this. Along with the game, a full house was lost yesterday and with it upwards of \u00a3500,000. English cricket can afford neither.
