He settled with the regulator without admitting to any wrongdoing. </p> <p>His father defended him, describing him as \"a good kid\", and pointing out that hundreds of thousands of day traders were doing the same thing: \"So they pick on a kid.\" </p> <p>The case raised fresh concerns about the power of the internet in affecting share prices. However, there was sympathy from his fellow traders. On one of Lebed's favourite sites, Silicon Investor, a trader named Carl remarked: \"He seemed more mature than the majority of people I see on here.\" </p> <p>Another, Jim S, remembered getting into \"childish\" arguments with Lebed but attributed this to \"the general immaturity of a lot of other investors\", adding: \"They only made him pay on 11 of 27 possible counts. That leaves 16, and probably a lot of dough left in his coffers.\" </p> <p>Lebed's chosen investments were generally unknown names such as Man Sang Holdings, Just Toys, Football USA and West Coast Entertainment. </p> <p>The SEC was alerted to his activities because his trades often accounted for a third or half of the daily volume in these stocks. </p> <p>There was sympathy from one anonymous day trader, who sent a message declaring: \"The kid who rigged the penny stocks should by given an honorary degree at Harvard. </p> <p>\"The guilty people are the brokers who dealt with a minor - not to mention the people who believed everything he said.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 15-year-old American schoolboy has been accused of making $285,000 (\u00a3202,000) by manipulating internet chatrooms in order to \"pump and dump\" shares. Jonathan Lebed, of New Jersey, has agreed to surrender the money to the securities and exchange commission, after becoming the youngest person ever to be accused of breaking share dealing rules. The SEC discovered that at least 11 times, Lebed bought shares in obscure, thinly traded companies, and within hours sent \"numerous false and/or misleading unsolicited email messages touting the stock he just purchased\". After watching the prices rise, he rapidly sold his shares, pocketing the proceeds. Described by his lawyer as \"a normal teenager who likes sport, music and hanging out with his friends\", Lebed learned about the market by watching business television channels. He settled with the regulator without admitting to any wrongdoing. His father defended him, describing him as \"a good kid\", and pointing out that hundreds of thousands of day traders were doing the same thing: \"So they pick on a kid.\" The case raised fresh concerns about the power of the internet in affecting share prices. However, there was sympathy from his fellow traders. On one of Lebed's favourite sites, Silicon Investor, a trader named Carl remarked: \"He seemed more mature than the majority of people I see on here.\" Another, Jim S, remembered getting into \"childish\" arguments with Lebed but attributed this to \"the general immaturity of a lot of other investors\", adding: \"They only made him pay on 11 of 27 possible counts. That leaves 16, and probably a lot of dough left in his coffers.\" Lebed's chosen investments were generally unknown names such as Man Sang Holdings, Just Toys, Football USA and West Coast Entertainment. The SEC was alerted to his activities because his trades often accounted for a third or half of the daily volume in these stocks. There was sympathy from one anonymous day trader, who sent a message declaring: \"The kid who rigged the penny stocks should by given an honorary degree at Harvard. \"The guilty people are the brokers who dealt with a minor - not to mention the people who believed everything he said.\"",

The relationships between Simon Keenlyside's press-ganged sailor Billy Budd, Kim Begley's Captain Vere, and Eric Halfvarson's master-at-arms Claggart, are the emotional and dramatic core of Britten's investigation of innocence, corruption and redemption on board the warship Indomitable in 1797. </p> <p>Halfvarson has a magnificently malevolent presence from his very first entrance. The laser-sharp focus and intensity of his voice carries Claggart inexorably to the climactic moment of his murder at the hands of the doomed, stammering Billy. Halfvarson's performance makes Claggart's essential evil stem from a virulent self-loathing. His Claggart manipulates the crew with inescapable force. </p> <p>This interpretation is the antithesis of Keenlyside's Billy Budd. The rounded tone of Keenlyside's voice and his natural athleticism show Billy's extroversion and simple-minded goodness; he is both vulnerable and strong-willed. During the first act, Keenlyside turns Billy into a holy fool - a well-loved member of the crew, incapable of believing that anyone could bear him malice. </p> <p>Claggart's first act solo demonstrates the depths of his appalling desire for Billy's death. But Halfvarson creates a Claggart who is more than a cipher for evil. The passion of his performance allows a glimpse of Claggart's depraved humanity; he reveals the roots of Claggart's wrong-doing in an acceptance of a chillingly ineluctable fate - his accidental death at the hands of Billy. And Billy becomes self-aware through a similar acknowledgement of his inevitable hanging in his final solo scene. </p> <p>Caught between Billy and Claggart is Kim Begley's Vere. Begley captures both Vere's reflective intelligence, and his tortured agonising between his feelings for Billy and his duty as a captain. And the whole opera is about a negotiation between private emotions and social responsibility. The success of this production is the way it seamlessly moves from the individual worlds of Billy, Claggart and Vere to the public domain of the crew. Alison Chitty's sets elegantly link Vere's lonely authority with the lusty community of Britten's sailors, among whom Alan Opie's po-faced pedant Mr Redburn and Stephen Richardson's Mr Flint are especially memorable. </p> <p>But perhaps the most important character in the work is the sea, represented in Britten's rich orchestration. Richard Hickox and the Royal Opera Orchestra play the score with symphonic scale and breadth, embodying the elemental power of the opera's emotional and natural forces, and binding together the human confusions at the heart of the story. Sadly there was also needless, non-human confusion in the form of the Opera House's decision to provide surtitles - an insult to the cast's faultless enunciation of EM Forster's libretto. </p> <p>Until October 3.

Thierry Henry had the ball in the net inside three minutes only to be flagged offside, harshly replays suggested, as he burst on to Nwanwko Kanu's pass. </p> <p>With Patrick Vieira winning tackles and spraying passes from midfield, and Kanu teasing with his skills in attack, it was virtual one-way traffic. Yuri Virt did well to save at his near post when Kanu shot from a tight angle and then he stopped an Henry effort. </p> <p>It was a sign of the task facing a young Shakhtar team, five of whose players were 23 or under, that their experienced captain Sergei Popov was booked for a late, groin-high challenge on Vieira. </p> <p>Robert Pires should have given Arsenal the lead in the 13th minute. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger expects his summer signing to get 10 goals a season, as he has in France for the past five years, and this was a fine opportunity for his first. But, played through by Henry's cute pass, he could only hit the goalkeeper's legs and if there was a danger to Arsenal it seemed to lie in poor finishing, a problem all season, or complacency. </p> <p>Hennadei Zubov offered a warning against the latter, volleying wide after Keown and Silvinho had dithered, but Arsenal were soon back on the offensive. At times they slalomed or jinked past opponents as if they barely existed, and when Vieira fed the shaven-headed Fredrik Ljungberg, Virt had to be quick to block the shot. </p> <p>Shakhtar hail from the mining region of eastern Ukraine and Virt could have done with a hard hat as the shots rained in. Not long after Kanu had sent an effort wide, Henry rattled the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards before the game turned amazingly as Shakhtar scored twice inside four minutes just before the half-hour. </p> <p>The first had a huge element of fortune. David Seaman seemed to have Alexei Bakharev's free-kick covered but the ball took a big deflection off Pires and flew into the opposite corner to the delight of the small but noisy pocket of orange-clad visiting fans. </p> <p>Barely had that claxon-hooting bunch got over the first goal when the second arrived. Sergei Atelkin sent a clever reverse pass between Keown and Oleg Luzhny, playing in place of the injured Tony Adams, and the 21-year-old Ukraine striker Andrei Vorobey neatly shot across Seaman and into the corner for his 11th goal of the season. </p> <p>Suddenly Shakhtar found a new determination and were a threat on the counter-attack as Arsenal took time to find their rhythm again. But the game turned their way just before half-time. </p> <p>First Popov was dismissed after a second booking for checking Vieira as the midfielder tried to burst through on goal. And then Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Sylvain Wiltord, a substitute for Pires, was clattered by Mykhaylo Starostyak as he tried to reach a cross by Dixon. Henry's spot-kick was saved but Wiltord put in the rebound. </p> <p>Arsenal's worried supporters must have expected their team to begin the second half with a welter of attacks. And after briefly struggling as Shakhtar put up to 10 men behind the ball, the chances began to arrive. </p> <p>A brilliant display of close control by Kanu which took him past three players ended with a low shot that fizzed just wide of the far post. Then Henry had an effort saved be fore meeting Silvinho's powerful left-wing cross and sending a back-flick narrowly wide. </p> <p>The Frenchman's aim was no better when he met a Wiltord centre at the near post and flicked it wide of the far one when he might have done better. Barely had Virt recovered from that when he was flinging himself to block from Wiltord. </p> <p>As the levels of frustration at Highbury rose, and with Shakhtar defending in numbers, the introduction of Dennis Bergkamp brought the number of Arsenal strikers to four and represented a last throw of the dice. </p> <p>It seemed Arsenal would pay for several missed chances against a Donetsk side reduced to 10 men just before half-time. But with time running out, Keown first chested in a corner by Bergkamp and then scored from close range from a Kanu cross. Embarrassment avoided then, but only just. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal </strong> (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Keown, Silvinho; Ljungberg (Bergkamp, 66min), Grimandi, Vieira, Pires (Wiltord, 34); Kanu, Henry. </p> <p><strong> Shakhtar Donetsk </strong> (4-4-2): Virt; Starostyak, Popov, Gleveckas, Shevchuk; Zubov, Tymoschuk, Bakharev (Bielik, 70), Abramov (Kryventsov, 58); Vorobey, Atelkin (Kovalov, 77). </p> <p><strong> Referee: </strong> H Strampe (Germany).</p>",

It was a sign of the task facing a young Shakhtar team, five of whose players were 23 or under, that their experienced captain Sergei Popov was booked for a late, groin-high challenge on Vieira. Robert Pires should have given Arsenal the lead in the 13th minute. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger expects his summer signing to get 10 goals a season, as he has in France for the past five years, and this was a fine opportunity for his first. But, played through by Henry's cute pass, he could only hit the goalkeeper's legs and if there was a danger to Arsenal it seemed to lie in poor finishing, a problem all season, or complacency. Hennadei Zubov offered a warning against the latter, volleying wide after Keown and Silvinho had dithered, but Arsenal were soon back on the offensive. At times they slalomed or jinked past opponents as if they barely existed, and when Vieira fed the shaven-headed Fredrik Ljungberg, Virt had to be quick to block the shot. Shakhtar hail from the mining region of eastern Ukraine and Virt could have done with a hard hat as the shots rained in. Not long after Kanu had sent an effort wide, Henry rattled the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards before the game turned amazingly as Shakhtar scored twice inside four minutes just before the half-hour. The first had a huge element of fortune. David Seaman seemed to have Alexei Bakharev's free-kick covered but the ball took a big deflection off Pires and flew into the opposite corner to the delight of the small but noisy pocket of orange-clad visiting fans. Barely had that claxon-hooting bunch got over the first goal when the second arrived. Sergei Atelkin sent a clever reverse pass between Keown and Oleg Luzhny, playing in place of the injured Tony Adams, and the 21-year-old Ukraine striker Andrei Vorobey neatly shot across Seaman and into the corner for his 11th goal of the season. Suddenly Shakhtar found a new determination and were a threat on the counter-attack as Arsenal took time to find their rhythm again. But the game turned their way just before half-time. First Popov was dismissed after a second booking for checking Vieira as the midfielder tried to burst through on goal. And then Arsenal were awarded a penalty when Sylvain Wiltord, a substitute for Pires, was clattered by Mykhaylo Starostyak as he tried to reach a cross by Dixon. Henry's spot-kick was saved but Wiltord put in the rebound. Arsenal's worried supporters must have expected their team to begin the second half with a welter of attacks. And after briefly struggling as Shakhtar put up to 10 men behind the ball, the chances began to arrive. A brilliant display of close control by Kanu which took him past three players ended with a low shot that fizzed just wide of the far post. Then Henry had an effort saved be fore meeting Silvinho's powerful left-wing cross and sending a back-flick narrowly wide. The Frenchman's aim was no better when he met a Wiltord centre at the near post and flicked it wide of the far one when he might have done better. Barely had Virt recovered from that when he was flinging himself to block from Wiltord. As the levels of frustration at Highbury rose, and with Shakhtar defending in numbers, the introduction of Dennis Bergkamp brought the number of Arsenal strikers to four and represented a last throw of the dice. It seemed Arsenal would pay for several missed chances against a Donetsk side reduced to 10 men just before half-time. But with time running out, Keown first chested in a corner by Bergkamp and then scored from close range from a Kanu cross. Embarrassment avoided then, but only just. Arsenal (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Luzhny, Keown, Silvinho; Ljungberg (Bergkamp, 66min), Grimandi, Vieira, Pires (Wiltord, 34); Kanu, Henry. Shakhtar Donetsk (4-4-2): Virt; Starostyak, Popov, Gleveckas, Shevchuk; Zubov, Tymoschuk, Bakharev (Bielik, 70), Abramov (Kryventsov, 58); Vorobey, Atelkin (Kovalov, 77).

The proportion in households with incomes below half the national average rose from 22% to 23% in Labour's first year in office and remained steady in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Mr Darling said the figures were taken before introduction of the enhanced minimum income guarantee for pensioners in April 1999. This was already helping 1.6m pensioner households by raising their income above the poverty threshold. And a recent campaign to encourage pensioners to claim the benefits to which they are entitled attracted 385,000 responses. </p> <p>\"These figures highlight the scale of the problem inherited by this government that took years to build up and will take some time to turn around.

Whereas Vialli was happy to field a team without a single Englishman, Ranieri believes the title cannot be won without a backbone of English players. Vialli may have changed his side more often than some people change their socks but rotation is not in the new head coach's limited English vocabulary. </p> <p>\"If a player is in good form he will be in the team,\" Ranieri said, flanked by an interpreter and Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson. \"It doesn't seem right to me to drop a player when he is playing well.

In the games he watched against St Gallen and Leicester he found spirit and unity lacking.

Ranieri's awkward shouts of \"go\", \"better\", \"quality\" and \"stay here Wisey\" explained why Di Matteo was translating and the coach will take English lessons along with his new right-hand men, his assistant Salvatore Antenucci and the goalkeeping coach Giorgio Pellizzano. </p> <p>Ranieri stressed that Vialli's assistants Ray Wilkins and Graham Rix will be kept on, although \"they won't be able to do exactly the same jobs they have been doing\".

      "body": "<p>After her departure from BSkyB, her recent appointment on the board of Future Network and promises of a new production company when her baby has arrived, how are things shaping up for Elisabeth Murdoch? And what place will she have in her father's empire?</p> <p>Born on August 22 1968, she is a Leo with her sun on the royal star Regulus, and like all Leos, she has to be boss. Her four-year stint at BSkyB coincided with forceful Mars crossing her Sun. As MD, this was her chance to show her Leo leadership skills, but it was marred by crossed swords with consecutive CEOs. </p> <p>Her horoscope shows a quieter phase as her Sun progresses into Libra, the sign of partnership, and partner Matthew Freud must have a lot to do with this. Her non-executive position at Future Network (April 22 1999) is a catch for this company, with its Sagittarian Ascendant plugging into the current media revolution initiated by the Jupiter-Pluto opposition. But Elisabeth has no obvious astrological connection here, and Future Network is unlikely to be a primary vehicle for her.</p> <p>With a strong Leo-Virgo combination in her horoscope, everything Elisabeth does is well planned. Her hopes for her own production company are expressed in true Leo style. \"I would like to be my own boss, I would like to pick my own team ... do my own thing, pursue my own opportunities, create my own culture and control my destiny\". </p> <p>Not knowing her birthtime, but based on the planets for her day of birth, her horoscope shows networking but little extrovert activity in the next two years. It isn't until June 2003 that it reflects her creative aspirations. Venus makes wonderful connections then to her Leo Sun, and we may at last see a major project that is truly hers. </p> <p>So what of her place in the Murdoch empire? She is a different spirit to her father. In contrast to his fishy Pisces, Elisabeth has no water, and no air either. With mainly opposition contacts between their charts, they have conflicting goals and attitudes, and she must find it impossible to pin him down. Her Venus and Pluto oppose his Sun and Mercury, hinting at the Persephone myth.

      "bodyText": "After her departure from BSkyB, her recent appointment on the board of Future Network and promises of a new production company when her baby has arrived, how are things shaping up for Elisabeth Murdoch? And what place will she have in her father's empire? Born on August 22 1968, she is a Leo with her sun on the royal star Regulus, and like all Leos, she has to be boss. Her four-year stint at BSkyB coincided with forceful Mars crossing her Sun. As MD, this was her chance to show her Leo leadership skills, but it was marred by crossed swords with consecutive CEOs. Her horoscope shows a quieter phase as her Sun progresses into Libra, the sign of partnership, and partner Matthew Freud must have a lot to do with this. Her non-executive position at Future Network (April 22 1999) is a catch for this company, with its Sagittarian Ascendant plugging into the current media revolution initiated by the Jupiter-Pluto opposition. But Elisabeth has no obvious astrological connection here, and Future Network is unlikely to be a primary vehicle for her. With a strong Leo-Virgo combination in her horoscope, everything Elisabeth does is well planned. Her hopes for her own production company are expressed in true Leo style. \"I would like to be my own boss, I would like to pick my own team ... do my own thing, pursue my own opportunities, create my own culture and control my destiny\". Not knowing her birthtime, but based on the planets for her day of birth, her horoscope shows networking but little extrovert activity in the next two years. It isn't until June 2003 that it reflects her creative aspirations. Venus makes wonderful connections then to her Leo Sun, and we may at last see a major project that is truly hers. So what of her place in the Murdoch empire? She is a different spirit to her father. In contrast to his fishy Pisces, Elisabeth has no water, and no air either. With mainly opposition contacts between their charts, they have conflicting goals and attitudes, and she must find it impossible to pin him down. Her Venus and Pluto oppose his Sun and Mercury, hinting at the Persephone myth. The beautiful daughter Persephone was pulled down into the underworld (Pluto/Hades), and she lost sight of the sky. Elisabeth's loss of Sky is the point of no return for her, too. She has broken her father's spell and shaken off the burden of being Murdoch's daughter, leaving the field clear for her brothers. When she resurfaces, it must be in her own light. Email the Media Medium at: maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

This does not restore the kind of confidence in the ITC that would make one confident of its continued existence. Compromises rarely work and I think this is an unhappy ending to an unhappy episode.\" </p> <p>But the shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, welcomed the announcement as a \"sensible compromise\". </p> <p>ITV has agreed to clearly signpost any schedule changes to viewers in advance, so that the public are well aware of the times of all bulletins. </p> <p>There will be no changes to ITV's Evening News bulletin at 6.30pm on weekdays.

The programme will now be 20 minutes long and will screen at 10pm from Monday to Thursday. The new name and announcers have not yet been announced. Friday night's bulletin will follow the weekend night news schedule and ITV will be allowed to broadcast the news later on one other weeknight to allow longer programmes. David Liddiment, ITV's director of programmes, described the compromise as an \"imaginative solution\". \"ITV retains the ability to adapt to changing viewer demands, remain commercially competitive and sustain investment in programming, whilst improving news accessibility for audiences,\" he said. \"Films, feature length drama and live sport, uninterrupted by news, will remain a key feature of the ITV schedule thanks to the flexibility we have secured.\" ITN has faced public outrage - plus statutory pressure from the ITC - since it began airing the news at the later time of 11pm late last year. The channel moved the news to free the 9pm to 11pm slot for prime time viewing, but the move prompted a ratings dive. The ITC has insisted on ITV moving the news forward, insisting most viewers were tucked up in bed before the 11pm broadcast. The ITC chairman, Sir Robin Biggam, said: \"ITV has a public service obligation to deliver national and international news to viewers. About 60% of the population still don't have access to multi-channel television, so they rely on terrestrial services to get their news and information.\" Today the new arrangement received mixed reactions from politicians. The chairman of the Commons culture committee, Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, said it called into question the competence of the ITC as an effective regulator. \"It is deplorable to say we are getting back News at Ten when it may not be News at Ten at all and when it will only be 20 minutes,\" he said. \"I think the ITC has shown itself to be too weak. This does not restore the kind of confidence in the ITC that would make one confident of its continued existence. Compromises rarely work and I think this is an unhappy ending to an unhappy episode.\" But the shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, welcomed the announcement as a \"sensible compromise\". ITV has agreed to clearly signpost any schedule changes to viewers in advance, so that the public are well aware of the times of all bulletins. There will be no changes to ITV's Evening News bulletin at 6.30pm on weekdays. The late night regional news bulletin will remain unchanged at 11.20pm. Useful links Independent Television News",

The highly expensive MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross has always been a subject of mystery, intrigue, double dealing and certainly an extravagent waste of public money. The huge headquarters - which the government recouped some cash for by allowing it to be used as the backdrop for the latest James Bond movie - ran spectacularly over budget, with the spies demanding all sorts of expensive whizz-kid gadgetry. They then tried to cover up the huge bill by demanding that the cost should be kept secret - and succeeded in delaying the disclosure for some five years. The pampered spies at MI5 and MI6 have a very cosy relationship with Parliament - which has had only a modicum of control over what they do. Membership of the Parliamentary committee that oversees the spies is by invitation from the Prime Minister. It rarely meets in public and most of the details in its reports are censored to protect the services from too much scrutiny. State secrecy is used to cover up incompetence. Until their moves to expensively renovated headquarters on both sides of the Thames - the spies enjoyed almost total protection - even the addresses of the headquarters were a state secret.

You may recall a certain Allan McDonald, Celtic's still-not-left-yet chief executive, claiming the proposed Atlantic League could be up and running within two years if, as he expected, Uefa gave the green light to the plan. Sadly, it appears that Uefa don't share his optimism and, in fact, are a bit annoyed about McDonald shouting his mouth off.</p> <p>\"We will reflect what the clubs have said to the executive committee, but suggestions that the green light is about to be given are simply wrong,\" said Uefa's communications director Mike Lee today. \"The integrity of domestic competitions and the current European club set-up is vital to the future of the whole of European football. You cannot look at these issues in isolation. We understand the concerns raised by the clubs but their proposed solution raises more questions than it answers.\" Oops.</p> <p>It's unlike Uefa to spurn an obvious money-spinner, but they do insist that they will be willing to listen to any other kooky plans the Scots or the Scandos have to offer. Not wanting to wait around, the Fiver has a few suggestions of its own to throw into the ring. Like allowing Ajax to subtly pretend to be Kilmarnock every Saturday, or depriving the Scottish Premier League of all integrity by catching it in bed with a buxom model. Or, even, telling Allan McDonald to keep his mouth shut until after a decision has been made.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I could tell they were scared. I could see it in their eyes. They were waiting for the end\" - Thierry Henry on Shakhtar Donetsk. He must presumably have seen these eyes while they were watching him scuff another chance past the far post.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>ROVERS RETURN HOME</strong></p> <p>It's all go at Ewood Park. Not content with simply inventing a football club, Graeme Souness, the future manager of Edinburgh United, has set about having a hand in all today's transfer news. Now, for those without memories as elephantine as the Fiver's, it might be worth reminding that Blackburn used to be quite a big club, and signing lots of players for exorbitant prices was their speciality. But Souness has adapted that policy for a modern age, and taken up not signing players for loads of money instead.</p> <p>First on the list is Lucien Mettomo, a Cameroon under-21 international who plays for St Etienne. Taking his inexperience into account, a sensible valuation of the centre-back appeared to be \u00a32.3m. So Rovers doubled it and, according to the club, Mettomo would have signed today if he had not failed a medical for unspecified reasons. \"Our medical staff are now in dialogue with their counterparts in St Etienne over Lucien's full medical history,\" an elusive Blackburn statement read today. \"We don't expect any further developments before the weekend and in the meantime Lucien has returned home to France.\"</p> <p>All of which fits nicely with nasty rumours that Mettomo was never actually in England in the first place. Far less contentious, however, is the news that Souness also won't be signing Eyal Berkovic. Rovers have regularly been linked with the Israeli international whose star has steadily waned since he followed Souness out of Southampton in 1997. But today Souness admitted: \"We will not be pursuing [Berkovic]. We have had a change in direction and have other irons in the fire.\" Which could be a handy reference to the fact that striker Kaba Diawara looks likely to join West Ham ('irons', you see) after being released from his loan spell at Rovers. That said, it could mean that Souness is about to buy Paul Stewart again. Who knows?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea have made an \u00a38.5m bid for Ajax midfielder Jesper Gronkjaer, according to reports. But the 23-year-old Danish midfielder has turned down the move as he wants to stay in Amsterdam for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Simon Colosimo, the Australian right-back whose career was threatened last year by an Andy Cole tackle, could face the Manchester United striker again: he's the subject of interest from West Ham, Middlesbrough and Sunderland. Colosimo would cost in the region of \u00a31m.</p> <p>Several clubs are interested in Liverpool defender Steve Staunton, according to Teamtalk. Tranmere and Wimbledon head a list that also includes Aston Villa and Coventry.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Manchester United defender Jaap Stam is likely to bring forward an operation on a niggling Achilles injury. Stam had planned to go under the knife in November after the first phase of Big Cup, but the injury is proving too troublesome. A three-month lay-off looks on the cards.</p> <p>Wolves have signed Stockport's 25-year-old midfielder Tony Dinning for \u00a3600,000, subject to a medical. Dinning could go straight into Colin Lee's side to face Norwich on Sunday.</p> <p>Gerard Wiekens and Kevin Horlock have been offered new contracts by Manchester City.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World Football (2.25am) No live Uefa Cup football this Thursday.</p> <p>Channel 5: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12.05am) Which means there's a distinct shortage of footer on the box.</p> <p>Dutch Football (12.35am) The torrent has been reduced to a drip, if you will.</p> <p>Argentinian Football (2.20am) I mean, who do these broadcasters think they are?</p> <p>Major League Soccer (4am) Getting us hooked on sport and then denying us our fix it's nothing short of cruel.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Fifa TV (7pm, 11.30pm) What, for example, are ONdigital up to, the evil doers?</p> <p>Spanish Football (8pm, 12midnight) They don't bother showing anything, as far as we can tell.

But even though Leeds upped their initial \u00a315m bid by a whopping 0 pounds, Hammers boss Harry Redknapp still isn't biting. \"They won't give up, will they?\" claimed Redknapp on his website (www.gorblimeytrousers.co.uk). \"They know how great a player he is and they know just what a great signing he would be for them.\" Not that he wasn't sorely tempted by the size of the 'new' offer. \"At times, I think about how many players I could bring in with the money from it, but I am desperate not to lose Rio because it would be a real blow if he left us.\" The temptation-shunning Redknapp went on to express his surprise at Leeds' tight tactics. \"It seems a bit strange it is the same offer on the table,\" his website article (www.councilflat.com) continued. \"Maybe they think if they keep trying they will get some joy. Or maybe they are receiving some encouragement from elsewhere, although I know it wouldn't come from Rio because he has told me how happy he is here.\" Although Leeds denied making the new bid - \"there has been no new bid\" - we can't see their wily Irish manager giving up on Rio yet. After all, he knows that where there's a will, there's a will. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ADVERTISEMENT Free minidish and digibox from Sky. You pay for installation.

You may recall a certain Allan McDonald, Celtic's still-not-left-yet chief executive, claiming the proposed Atlantic League could be up and running within two years if, as he expected, Uefa gave the green light to the plan. Sadly, it appears that Uefa don't share his optimism and, in fact, are a bit annoyed about McDonald shouting his mouth off. \"We will reflect what the clubs have said to the executive committee, but suggestions that the green light is about to be given are simply wrong,\" said Uefa's communications director Mike Lee today. \"The integrity of domestic competitions and the current European club set-up is vital to the future of the whole of European football. You cannot look at these issues in isolation. We understand the concerns raised by the clubs but their proposed solution raises more questions than it answers.\" Oops. It's unlike Uefa to spurn an obvious money-spinner, but they do insist that they will be willing to listen to any other kooky plans the Scots or the Scandos have to offer. Not wanting to wait around, the Fiver has a few suggestions of its own to throw into the ring. Like allowing Ajax to subtly pretend to be Kilmarnock every Saturday, or depriving the Scottish Premier League of all integrity by catching it in bed with a buxom model. Or, even, telling Allan McDonald to keep his mouth shut until after a decision has been made. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I could tell they were scared. I could see it in their eyes. They were waiting for the end\" - Thierry Henry on Shakhtar Donetsk. He must presumably have seen these eyes while they were watching him scuff another chance past the far post. * * * * * * * * * * * * * ROVERS RETURN HOME It's all go at Ewood Park. Not content with simply inventing a football club, Graeme Souness, the future manager of Edinburgh United, has set about having a hand in all today's transfer news. Now, for those without memories as elephantine as the Fiver's, it might be worth reminding that Blackburn used to be quite a big club, and signing lots of players for exorbitant prices was their speciality. But Souness has adapted that policy for a modern age, and taken up not signing players for loads of money instead. First on the list is Lucien Mettomo, a Cameroon under-21 international who plays for St Etienne. Taking his inexperience into account, a sensible valuation of the centre-back appeared to be \u00a32.3m. So Rovers doubled it and, according to the club, Mettomo would have signed today if he had not failed a medical for unspecified reasons. \"Our medical staff are now in dialogue with their counterparts in St Etienne over Lucien's full medical history,\" an elusive Blackburn statement read today. \"We don't expect any further developments before the weekend and in the meantime Lucien has returned home to France.\" All of which fits nicely with nasty rumours that Mettomo was never actually in England in the first place. Far less contentious, however, is the news that Souness also won't be signing Eyal Berkovic. Rovers have regularly been linked with the Israeli international whose star has steadily waned since he followed Souness out of Southampton in 1997. But today Souness admitted: \"We will not be pursuing [Berkovic]. We have had a change in direction and have other irons in the fire.\" Which could be a handy reference to the fact that striker Kaba Diawara looks likely to join West Ham ('irons', you see) after being released from his loan spell at Rovers. That said, it could mean that Souness is about to buy Paul Stewart again. Who knows? * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea have made an \u00a38.5m bid for Ajax midfielder Jesper Gronkjaer, according to reports. But the 23-year-old Danish midfielder has turned down the move as he wants to stay in Amsterdam for the foreseeable future. Simon Colosimo, the Australian right-back whose career was threatened last year by an Andy Cole tackle, could face the Manchester United striker again: he's the subject of interest from West Ham, Middlesbrough and Sunderland. Colosimo would cost in the region of \u00a31m. Several clubs are interested in Liverpool defender Steve Staunton, according to Teamtalk. Tranmere and Wimbledon head a list that also includes Aston Villa and Coventry. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester United defender Jaap Stam is likely to bring forward an operation on a niggling Achilles injury. Stam had planned to go under the knife in November after the first phase of Big Cup, but the injury is proving too troublesome. A three-month lay-off looks on the cards. Wolves have signed Stockport's 25-year-old midfielder Tony Dinning for \u00a3600,000, subject to a medical. Dinning could go straight into Colin Lee's side to face Norwich on Sunday. Gerard Wiekens and Kevin Horlock have been offered new contracts by Manchester City. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: World Football (2.25am) No live Uefa Cup football this Thursday.

Police said that he was a dangerous man who had learnt to manipulate the legal system. Without the other women's evidence, the chances of convicting him would have been \"less than average\". Edwards, 39, had been cleared at previous trials of raping most of the women and it was the first time a defendant's previous acquittals had been produced during a trial. Judge Leonard Gerber told the jury: \"You have been party to the making of legal history.\" The jury was told it need not just take Miss D's word that she had not consented to sex with Edwards. Five other women gave evidence, claiming they had been forced into sex - and then Edwards had claimed they were willing partners. Edwards, from Sydenham, south London, had denied raping Miss D and protested it was \"unfair\" that the jury was told about his previous court appearances. Edwards, who boasted he had 2,000 lovers since the age of 12 when he fathered a child, was first accused of rape in 1981. He was convicted of rape twice and cleared of attacking women five times. The various juries were not told of the previous accusations. In the latest case, Miss D said she was raped twice when Edwards tricked her into going to his room after they had been at a south London wine bar in August, 1998. Police believe there are more victims who have been afraid to come forward. Two women have contacted police since the beginning of the trial. Detectives said that Edwards was a serial rapist who calculated what the women would tell police - and \"tailored\" his defence to answer their allegations in court. It was always his word against each woman's. But when Edwards was accused for the eighth time, the Crown Prosecution Service decided to call his bluff and produce the other accusers in court. The case had been taken to the highest court in the land after Old Bailey Judge Leonard Gerber denied the prosecution's application to produce the previous accusers. His judgement was upheld in the Court of Appeal but the Law Lords ruled the evidence could be produced on the basis the defendant was not placed in double jeopardy of being prosecuted again for the same crimes. David Parry, prosecuting, said there were \"striking similarities\" between the crimes, which gave rise to \"exceptional circumstances\" in which previous accusers could give evidence. After the verdict, Detective Sergeant Paul Astvury said Edwards was a \"very dangerous\" man. He added: \"He is very much a threat to women. He is like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - very charming until he turns into a rapist, then reverts back.\" He praised the women for their \"bravery and courage\" in giving evidence against Edwards.

      "byline": "Belinda Archer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last week, the photographer who took the famous 1960 shot of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara won a landmark case to assert copyright over the snap and claim royalties for its usage. The case had been triggered by the use of the picture in a press ad for a spicy brand of Smirnoff vodka. This had been overprinted with a hammer and sickle motif, with the sickle substituted by a chilli pepper. Alberto Diaz Gutierrez was upset because he felt that the chilli trivialised the historical significance of his photo and its subject, and was awarded a \"substantial\" payment by Lowe Lintas, the London agency which had created the ad. </p> <p>But admen have always liked to use celebrities - especially dead ones - in their advertisements. BA is currently running a 60-second ad which stars a parade of classic figures trooping through the airport lounge. These include Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and John Lennon, all of whom, says the airline, chose to fly with BA at some stage during their lives. </p> <p>One2One has also recently mounted several TV ads starring, among others, Ian Wright having a \"one to one\" with Dr Martin Luther King, and Kate Moss chatting to Elvis. Classic black and white shots of Audrey Hepburn appear regularly in association with various leading jewellery manufacturers, while Albert Einstein has been used to plug British Gas and numerous other spuriously scientific products. </p> <p>Given the potential difficulties, as highlighted by the Che Guevara lawsuit, why do advertisers use dead personalities? And why are consumers so attracted by these endorsements from beyond the grave? </p> <p>Peter Souter, executive creative director of Abbott Mead Vickers, the UK's biggest advertising agency, says: \"Using celebrities firstly gets your ad noticed, and secondly acts as a shorthand for communication. But if you want to use a big Hollywood star you normally can't get them until they are past their best. The good thing with a dead star is that they are not spoilt. Steve McQueen never got to the stage where he made a bad film, hence he will always be a beautiful, cool young man.\" </p> <p>Charlie Crighton, account director for Ford at Young &amp; Rubicam, also cites the general appeal of famous personalities: \"There is an aspirational nature to celebrities. They automatically have an elevated position, but they can also suddenly achieve cult or legend status when they are dead in a way that they weren't when alive.\" </p> <p>Deciding on which personality to use is the key. Simply bunging any celebrity, dead or alive, into a com mercial alongside a given product is not enough - there has to be a relevance and a neat fit that consumers can appreciate. The cost of using celebrities who have passed away can be high, and not necessarily a cheaper option than using living ones. </p> <p>Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the agency behind the One2One commercials, claims that securing permission to use Luther King and Elvis was almost prohibitively expensive. \"It's not about saving money at all,\" said John O'Keeffe, BBH executive creative director. \"It can be as costly, if not more so, than using living personalities, but it can pay massive dividends.\" </p> <p>Money aside, the advertiser then has to set about seeking permission.

      "bodyText": "Last week, the photographer who took the famous 1960 shot of the Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara won a landmark case to assert copyright over the snap and claim royalties for its usage. The case had been triggered by the use of the picture in a press ad for a spicy brand of Smirnoff vodka. This had been overprinted with a hammer and sickle motif, with the sickle substituted by a chilli pepper. Alberto Diaz Gutierrez was upset because he felt that the chilli trivialised the historical significance of his photo and its subject, and was awarded a \"substantial\" payment by Lowe Lintas, the London agency which had created the ad. But admen have always liked to use celebrities - especially dead ones - in their advertisements. BA is currently running a 60-second ad which stars a parade of classic figures trooping through the airport lounge. These include Winston Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and John Lennon, all of whom, says the airline, chose to fly with BA at some stage during their lives. One2One has also recently mounted several TV ads starring, among others, Ian Wright having a \"one to one\" with Dr Martin Luther King, and Kate Moss chatting to Elvis. Classic black and white shots of Audrey Hepburn appear regularly in association with various leading jewellery manufacturers, while Albert Einstein has been used to plug British Gas and numerous other spuriously scientific products. Given the potential difficulties, as highlighted by the Che Guevara lawsuit, why do advertisers use dead personalities? And why are consumers so attracted by these endorsements from beyond the grave? Peter Souter, executive creative director of Abbott Mead Vickers, the UK's biggest advertising agency, says: \"Using celebrities firstly gets your ad noticed, and secondly acts as a shorthand for communication. But if you want to use a big Hollywood star you normally can't get them until they are past their best. The good thing with a dead star is that they are not spoilt. Steve McQueen never got to the stage where he made a bad film, hence he will always be a beautiful, cool young man.\" Charlie Crighton, account director for Ford at Young &amp; Rubicam, also cites the general appeal of famous personalities: \"There is an aspirational nature to celebrities. They automatically have an elevated position, but they can also suddenly achieve cult or legend status when they are dead in a way that they weren't when alive.\" Deciding on which personality to use is the key. Simply bunging any celebrity, dead or alive, into a com mercial alongside a given product is not enough - there has to be a relevance and a neat fit that consumers can appreciate. The cost of using celebrities who have passed away can be high, and not necessarily a cheaper option than using living ones. Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the agency behind the One2One commercials, claims that securing permission to use Luther King and Elvis was almost prohibitively expensive. \"It's not about saving money at all,\" said John O'Keeffe, BBH executive creative director. \"It can be as costly, if not more so, than using living personalities, but it can pay massive dividends.\" Money aside, the advertiser then has to set about seeking permission. Y&amp;R went through long, drawn-out negotiations with McQueen's estate and with Warner Brothers, which made Bullitt, before gaining the right to use the classic footage in its commercial. Similarly, M&amp;C Saatchi, the agency which created the BA \"roll of honour\"ad, jumped through many hoops to secure its stars. Richard Alford, a group account director at M&amp;C, explains: \"The clearances were a lot of work and took over three months to tie up.

      "bodyText": "President Alberto Fujimori's surprise announcement last weekend that he would step down and call fresh elections followed signs that he was losing the support of the powerful military in the fallout from two major corruption scandals involving Peru's notorious intelligence service. Mr Fujimori's decision, announced in a national address, stunned the country and left Peru's opposition scrambling to build a united front. Officials said the election was likely to be held within six months, and Vice-President Francisco Tudela said that Mr Fujimori \"has the full intention of staying in power during that time\". For their part, opposition leaders demanded that Mr Fujimori step down immediately in favour of a transition government. Last Saturday's announcement was a breathtaking reversal for Mr Fujimori, Latin America's longest-serving elected leader, who had weathered severe criticism since winning an unprecedented third five-year term in May elections widely described as unfair. International pressure had been mounting on him to agree to democratic reforms, including firing Vladimiro Montesinos, the architect of Peru's ruthless intelligence service, who has been Mr Fujimori's most important aide since his rise from obscure academic to president in 1990. Demands to deal decisively with Mr Montesinos reached a climax after a videotape was made public last week showing the intelligence chief handing a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman to back Mr Fujimori. With pressure growing on Mr Fujimori to act, several key regional leaders of Peru's military refused to attend a meeting called by the president last Saturday to gauge his support within the armed forces, but it was unclear whether the military chiefs withdrew their support for Mr Fujimori out of loyalty to Mr Montesinos or in an effort to hasten his, and Mr Fujimori's, departure. In a sign that elements of the military were opposed to Mr Montesinos, Fernando Olivera - head of the opposition Independent Moralising Front - who obtained the damaging videotape, said that it had \"come from a civilian source with links to a discontented segment of the military\". Mr Olivera said he has obtained other tapes from intelligence sources that show footage of Mr Montesinos bribing businessmen, journalists, politicians and even some military officers to support Mr Fujimori. On Tuesday Mr Montesinos was reported to be holed up at a Peruvian military base as opposition politicians demanded his arrest. \"The military obviously played a key role,\" said Francisco Loayza, an intelligence adviser to Mr Fujimori in the early days of his first administration. \"As far as I can tell... they began withdrawing support as the scandal around Mr Montesinos grew. Mr Fujimori saw what he built begin to come apart, and decided it was not possible to continue governing.\" In his address Mr Fujimori said that he was dismantling the National Intelligence Service. The organisation had been instrumental in destroying the leadership of two leftist guerrilla groups during the early 1990s - by means that human rights groups said included torture, executions, and intimidation and persecution of many innocent Peruvians. Mr Fujimori's announcement set off spontaneous celebrations across Peru, including in the capital's main plaza opposite the presidential palace, where flag-waving revelers converged. Mr Fujimori's decision was hailed by the United States, which has had an uneasy relationship with the president, supporting his hard line on drug traffickers, but opposing his moves against democracy. A White House statement said: \"We welcome the bold step taken by President Fujimori. The actions announced... are clearly aimed at resolving the political polarisation facing Peru [and]... represent a good beginning to such an endeavour.\" Mr Fujimori's decision was an unexpected windfall for Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the second round of balloting for the presidency in May.

      "body": "<p>As you might expect from a movie about karaoke starring Gwyneth Paltrow and directed by her dad, Bruce, Duets has already generated its fair share of pre-release stories. Undoubtedly the weirdest tale, however, concerns the man who plays Paltrow's on-screen father. \"Huey very quickly became my musical manager and advice-giver,\" la Paltrow claims. \"He would say, 'You have to make a record', and I'd say, 'I'm just happy to sing with you.'\" </p> <p>The \"Huey\" in question, as will become clear when the film opens here on November 17, is none another than arse-chinned 80s rocker Huey Lewis, and there will be many readers who need no more evidence than Gwyneth's gush to assume that the actress badly needs a spell in the rubber room. Lewis, after all, is the man who told an entire generation of MTV drones that it was \"hip to be square\" - advice that, under laboratory conditions, has proven to be completely erroneous. Moreover, despite enjoying massive success during the 80s with his band The News, the singer now seems to be entering his second decade in the Where Are They Now? file. </p> <p>There are some of us, however, who believe that HLATN are not just the all-singing, all-gurning pub-rock gonks that they might appear at first glance, but rather writers and performers of genuine calibre. One commentator, for example, has called the band's third album, Sports, \"a flawless masterpiece. Every song has the potential to be a huge hit, and most of them were. What to say to Sports dissenters in the long run? Nine million people can't be wrong.\" </p> <p>Admittedly, the \"commentator\" in question is Patrick Bateman, the nailgun-toting, mass-murdering yuppie hero of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, and by no means the man one would automatically turn to for musical advice (he is also a big fan of Genesis - although not, in his defence, of their early work). Yet the fact that Ellis spends no less than eight pages extolling the virtues of Lewis and co - Whitney Houston only gets four - rams home quite what grand fromages they used to be. </p> <p>Then again, Huey was never exactly your underachieving type. Born Hugh Anthony Cregg III (his stage moniker, originally Huey Louie, comes from two of Donald Duck's nephews), the young singer scored a perfect 800 on his maths SAT, securing him a place at Cornell University. But his father persuaded Lewis to take a year off, which he spent hitch-hiking around Europe. </p> <p>While waiting for rides he taught himself to play the harmonica and, by the end of his stay, was being paid to perform gigs at $150 a pop. From there on it was predictable that Lewis's engineering course would take second place to his burgeoning musical career as frontman for a student band called Slippery Elm. Unsurprisingly, they never got anywhere - would you buy a record by a band called Slippery Elm? - but his next group, Clover, caught the ear of visiting Brit Nick Lowe, who suggested that their good-time pub rock might find a more sympathetic ear in mid-70s Blighty. As it happens, Lowe was wrong in this assessment and Clover's records bombed despite members of the band backing Elvis Costello on his debut album. </p> <p>Such a setback didn't deter Huey, though, who simply formed a new group, the News. After their eponymous debut album sank without trace, it looked as if this latest incarnation might also go the way of Clover and Slippery Elm, but the band's second record, Picture This, sold more than 500,000 copies. </p> <p>It was Sports, though, that made them megastars. Released in 1983, the album's no-nonsense, kick-ass rock enraptured an American nation growing weary of fey Brit invaders like Culture Club and Duran Duran. The success of Sports - which stayed in the US charts for a mind-boggling 158 weeks - was matched by their next album, Fore!, thanks in large part to their Back To The Future tie-in single The Power Of Love. </p> <p>The Spielberg-produced movie also featured a cameo from Huey as a teacher, paving the way for appearances in such films as Short Cuts and Sphere. And while his musical career foundered in the wake of 1988's bizarrely reggae-fied Small World album, his acting career has taken on a new lease of life. In fact, critics who have seen Duets are already hailing his performance as the best thing in what seems a pretty bad job, with one reviewer urging readers to \"savour the timbre of his voice and the planes of his face\". </p> <p>But Huey's relationship with Tinseltown has not always been a happy one. When Mary Harron's big-screen version of American Psycho came out, for example, Huey refused permission for the accompanying soundtrack to contain Hip To Be Square, promoting all manner of headlines inferring that Lewis was indeed more square than hip (Lewis's manager claimed the issue was contractual rather than censorial). </p> <p>In between his acting gigs, meanwhile, the singer has continued playing the musical kind, and is currently awaiting feedback on an album sampler that's been sent to leading record company executives. One can only pray that some West Coast firm has the sense to pick it up and prove that Bateman was right about Huey being indeed \"a vocalist, musician and writer who just can't be topped\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "As you might expect from a movie about karaoke starring Gwyneth Paltrow and directed by her dad, Bruce, Duets has already generated its fair share of pre-release stories. Undoubtedly the weirdest tale, however, concerns the man who plays Paltrow's on-screen father. \"Huey very quickly became my musical manager and advice-giver,\" la Paltrow claims. \"He would say, 'You have to make a record', and I'd say, 'I'm just happy to sing with you.'\" The \"Huey\" in question, as will become clear when the film opens here on November 17, is none another than arse-chinned 80s rocker Huey Lewis, and there will be many readers who need no more evidence than Gwyneth's gush to assume that the actress badly needs a spell in the rubber room. Lewis, after all, is the man who told an entire generation of MTV drones that it was \"hip to be square\" - advice that, under laboratory conditions, has proven to be completely erroneous. Moreover, despite enjoying massive success during the 80s with his band The News, the singer now seems to be entering his second decade in the Where Are They Now? file. There are some of us, however, who believe that HLATN are not just the all-singing, all-gurning pub-rock gonks that they might appear at first glance, but rather writers and performers of genuine calibre. One commentator, for example, has called the band's third album, Sports, \"a flawless masterpiece. Every song has the potential to be a huge hit, and most of them were. What to say to Sports dissenters in the long run? Nine million people can't be wrong.\" Admittedly, the \"commentator\" in question is Patrick Bateman, the nailgun-toting, mass-murdering yuppie hero of Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho, and by no means the man one would automatically turn to for musical advice (he is also a big fan of Genesis - although not, in his defence, of their early work). Yet the fact that Ellis spends no less than eight pages extolling the virtues of Lewis and co - Whitney Houston only gets four - rams home quite what grand fromages they used to be. Then again, Huey was never exactly your underachieving type. Born Hugh Anthony Cregg III (his stage moniker, originally Huey Louie, comes from two of Donald Duck's nephews), the young singer scored a perfect 800 on his maths SAT, securing him a place at Cornell University. But his father persuaded Lewis to take a year off, which he spent hitch-hiking around Europe. While waiting for rides he taught himself to play the harmonica and, by the end of his stay, was being paid to perform gigs at $150 a pop. From there on it was predictable that Lewis's engineering course would take second place to his burgeoning musical career as frontman for a student band called Slippery Elm. Unsurprisingly, they never got anywhere - would you buy a record by a band called Slippery Elm? - but his next group, Clover, caught the ear of visiting Brit Nick Lowe, who suggested that their good-time pub rock might find a more sympathetic ear in mid-70s Blighty. As it happens, Lowe was wrong in this assessment and Clover's records bombed despite members of the band backing Elvis Costello on his debut album. Such a setback didn't deter Huey, though, who simply formed a new group, the News. After their eponymous debut album sank without trace, it looked as if this latest incarnation might also go the way of Clover and Slippery Elm, but the band's second record, Picture This, sold more than 500,000 copies. It was Sports, though, that made them megastars. Released in 1983, the album's no-nonsense, kick-ass rock enraptured an American nation growing weary of fey Brit invaders like Culture Club and Duran Duran. The success of Sports - which stayed in the US charts for a mind-boggling 158 weeks - was matched by their next album, Fore!, thanks in large part to their Back To The Future tie-in single The Power Of Love. The Spielberg-produced movie also featured a cameo from Huey as a teacher, paving the way for appearances in such films as Short Cuts and Sphere. And while his musical career foundered in the wake of 1988's bizarrely reggae-fied Small World album, his acting career has taken on a new lease of life. In fact, critics who have seen Duets are already hailing his performance as the best thing in what seems a pretty bad job, with one reviewer urging readers to \"savour the timbre of his voice and the planes of his face\". But Huey's relationship with Tinseltown has not always been a happy one. When Mary Harron's big-screen version of American Psycho came out, for example, Huey refused permission for the accompanying soundtrack to contain Hip To Be Square, promoting all manner of headlines inferring that Lewis was indeed more square than hip (Lewis's manager claimed the issue was contractual rather than censorial). In between his acting gigs, meanwhile, the singer has continued playing the musical kind, and is currently awaiting feedback on an album sampler that's been sent to leading record company executives. One can only pray that some West Coast firm has the sense to pick it up and prove that Bateman was right about Huey being indeed \"a vocalist, musician and writer who just can't be topped\".",

      "body": "<p>I was having a quiet drink with an old friend the other day when he told me, very proudly, that he had just finished his first novel. This was completely out of character - he had never displayed any interest in writing before - and, with mounting amazement, I asked him what it was about. </p> <p>\"Oh, it was the first Harry Potter book; it really was excellent. I don't know why I haven't tried reading books before,\" he said. </p> <p>After insisting he buy the next round for cracking such an awful Queen Mum gag (weak and terribly old but loved by an insane segment of the population purely because of this), I looked back at the feelings that rushed through my head when I thought he really had completed his first novel. </p> <p>Topping the winner's rostrum was undoubtedly amazement but there, in second and third place looking disappointed as amazement's national anthem played, were envy and depression. Envy because I have never managed to finish a novel and depression because I am worried I never will. This dismal duo could well sound familiar to you; many people dream of writing a novel but few actually finish one, and fewer still get it published, become millionaires and bask forever in the glow of literary appreciation. </p> <p>My biggest problems, the same as many thousands of people, are that I find it hard to get started and am overly critical of the words I do manage to write. In search of a solution to these, I turned to the web. </p> <p>One of the first sites I came across was <a href=\"http://www.inkspot.com\">www.inkspot.com</a>, which describes itself as an \"award-winning resource and community for writers of all ages and levels of experience\". This actually is not too far off; there are plenty of helpful articles on different aspects of writing, a discussion forum and masses of links to other online resources. </p> <p>Reading the articles and joining in the discussions helped me to get a better perspective on my writing. Although I knew in theory that the first draft of a book does not have to be perfect, the truth of it was brought home to me only by chatting to people who had gone through the process. </p> <p>If you are unsure about what you are doing, getting on to the right discussion forum can really help.

      "bodyText": "I was having a quiet drink with an old friend the other day when he told me, very proudly, that he had just finished his first novel. This was completely out of character - he had never displayed any interest in writing before - and, with mounting amazement, I asked him what it was about. \"Oh, it was the first Harry Potter book; it really was excellent. I don't know why I haven't tried reading books before,\" he said. After insisting he buy the next round for cracking such an awful Queen Mum gag (weak and terribly old but loved by an insane segment of the population purely because of this), I looked back at the feelings that rushed through my head when I thought he really had completed his first novel. Topping the winner's rostrum was undoubtedly amazement but there, in second and third place looking disappointed as amazement's national anthem played, were envy and depression. Envy because I have never managed to finish a novel and depression because I am worried I never will. This dismal duo could well sound familiar to you; many people dream of writing a novel but few actually finish one, and fewer still get it published, become millionaires and bask forever in the glow of literary appreciation. My biggest problems, the same as many thousands of people, are that I find it hard to get started and am overly critical of the words I do manage to write. In search of a solution to these, I turned to the web. One of the first sites I came across was www.inkspot.com, which describes itself as an \"award-winning resource and community for writers of all ages and levels of experience\". This actually is not too far off; there are plenty of helpful articles on different aspects of writing, a discussion forum and masses of links to other online resources. Reading the articles and joining in the discussions helped me to get a better perspective on my writing. Although I knew in theory that the first draft of a book does not have to be perfect, the truth of it was brought home to me only by chatting to people who had gone through the process. If you are unsure about what you are doing, getting on to the right discussion forum can really help. Inkspot also offers a free bi-weekly email newsletter, called Inklings, which keeps you in touch with new articles and features on the site. I found another discussion forum at http://jp.onelist.com/community/1writers. There are a few people there who like to discuss novel writing but there are many more who are just interested in writing bad poetry, so be careful. A much more down to earth and practical site can be found at www.manistee.com/~lkraus/workshop/.

      "body": "<p><strong> Toeing the line</strong></p> <p>We've done our best to spare you but all the while the pile has been mounting and now there's no getting away from it: the bugbear that burdens you all most is your mobile phone. If you're not trapped in a punitive contract your funds are being siphoned off into unknown pockets, your statements are registering calls you never made, or you're being hounded for line rental you never owed. </p> <p>Trevor Aylward of London is among those who have found that the zeal with which companies lure your custom can turn into a suffocating affection from which it's difficult to break free. He wrote three times over three months to disconnect his line after losing his handset, but BT Cellnet claimed to have heard nothing and continued helping itself to line rental. Only when Aylward cancelled his direct debit was it roused from its slumber. Its response was to chase him for \u00a367.60 for yet more unwanted line rental. </p> <p><strong> \u0095BT Cellnet insists it has no record of the three letters but blames itself for not taking action earlier to find out why. As a \"gesture of goodwill\" it has waived the \u00a367 charge that Aylesford maintains he never owed in the first place and, ominously, has told him to ignore any bullying from its debt recovery agency. </strong></p> <p><strong> Contract killers </strong></p> <p>Elizabeth Selby wrote to terminate her contract with RSL last autumn and received a letter in November confirming that her \"enquiry\" would be actioned within 10 working days. She cancelled her direct debit and assumed that the account was closed. In January RSL demanded to know how she proposed paying her bills and she reminded them of the cancellation. In February she was told that her line would be disconnected at the end of the month and in May she heard that the account was now closed but she owed them \u00a346 in line rental. Selby pointed out the account should have been closed in December and any subsequent charges were RSL's mistake, but received no reply. </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"It was an oversight,\" pleads RSL. \"A staff member who no longer works here only actioned half the request ... It is unacceptable lack of attention to detail.\" Selby's account has now been cleared and her \u00a315 disconnection fee waived in contrition.</strong> </p> <p><strong> Put the receiver down</strong></p> <p>Vira Bhaskar of Cambridge was offered a free trial of a mobile phone by the late lamented telesales firm 1st Line. He rang to terminate the deal within the specified 14-day period and was told his free trial had been extended to two months. A month later 1st Line went into receivership and Bhaskar found himself being billed for line rental by Cellular Ops. As the latter requires a 30-day cancellation notice he'll have to pay another month's rental before he can be shot of the phone. </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"As 1st Line was our dealer and not our agent we are not liable for any concessions, offers or incentives offered by them,\" shrugs Cellular Operations. It points out that customers can write to 1st Line's receivers, Grant Thornton, but, it adds ominously, \"due to the massive debt left owing by 1st Line it is highly unlikely that any claims will be met\". </strong></p> <p><strong> How to hang up </strong></p> <p>Both Sue Allan and Jeremy Minton eventually managed to break free from their respective service providers but say that the process was a nightmare with the companies insisting they'd not received any written communications or failing to act on those they did get. \"The trading standards officer I phoned said that the only certain way of cancelling was to send your letter by registered post,\" says Allan. Oftel advises customers to keep copies of all letters of cancellation and will lend an ear to those who can't resolve their problem with their service provider. </p> <p> <strong> Hold on to your SIM </strong></p> <p> When Andy Grandmottet-Shaw's mobile broke down it was dispatched to One2One for repair. Three weeks after it was received back she was sent a bill for \u00a3875 worth of international calls, made while the phone was out of her possession. One2One promised to look into it and the result was a second bill for the same amount. Weeks on, however, everyone at One2One had a different story to tell. </p> <p><strong> \u0095After Consumer jogs its memory One2One says it is waiving all charges. \"If customers send phones back to be repaired they must take their SIM card out, otherwise it's like sending off your handbag with all your credit cards inside,\" warns a spokeswoman. </strong></p> <p><strong> Whose line is it anyway? </strong></p> <p> Meanwhile Rebecca Dowman was wondering why One2One was charging her \u00a3300 for calls made on a phone with a number she doesn't possess. After several days of trying to contact customer services she was assured the error would be rectified, but the demands kept on coming. One2One insisted she report the \"fraud\" to the police, although the problem was evidently due to an account mix up. The police, unsurprisingly, declined to intervene and Dowman resumed her efforts with One2One. The response was a new bill for \u00a3398.36. </p> <p><strong> \u0095One2One declares that the number on which the calls are being made is non-existent, but that somebody's using it. \"Ms Dowman was charged due to an administrative error and we've referred it to our fraud office,\" says a spokeswoman. \"She won't be receiving any more bills.\" </strong></p> <p><strong> More broken promises </strong></p> <p> Back to BT Cellnet, which deemed Julie McGovern's damaged handset irreparable and ordered her a new phone with a different number. Alas, it continued to debit monthly line rental for the disused phone as well as its replacement. BT declared itself unable to refund her but said that, in recompense, it would reactivate her old number and dispatch a new handset free to her partner, Sam Goldie. All Goldie would have to pay would be call charges. But when the phone arrived, Goldie found himself billed for line rental so he sent it back. BT promised to investigate but instead unleashed its debt collection agency which harrassed Goldie into paying \u00a362. Since then he's heard nothing. </p> <p><strong> \u0095\"An admin error was compounded by further errors, which is unacceptable,\" says BT Cellnet. It has now refunded Goldie and McGovern the disputed payments for both phones. </strong></p> <p><strong> Thieves make a call </strong></p> <p> At least there's comfort in company. Hilary Mandleberg's handbag was stolen last January and the thieves used her bank details to open half a dozen One2One accounts.

      "bodyText": "Toeing the line We've done our best to spare you but all the while the pile has been mounting and now there's no getting away from it: the bugbear that burdens you all most is your mobile phone. If you're not trapped in a punitive contract your funds are being siphoned off into unknown pockets, your statements are registering calls you never made, or you're being hounded for line rental you never owed. Trevor Aylward of London is among those who have found that the zeal with which companies lure your custom can turn into a suffocating affection from which it's difficult to break free. He wrote three times over three months to disconnect his line after losing his handset, but BT Cellnet claimed to have heard nothing and continued helping itself to line rental. Only when Aylward cancelled his direct debit was it roused from its slumber. Its response was to chase him for \u00a367.60 for yet more unwanted line rental. \u0095BT Cellnet insists it has no record of the three letters but blames itself for not taking action earlier to find out why. As a \"gesture of goodwill\" it has waived the \u00a367 charge that Aylesford maintains he never owed in the first place and, ominously, has told him to ignore any bullying from its debt recovery agency. Contract killers Elizabeth Selby wrote to terminate her contract with RSL last autumn and received a letter in November confirming that her \"enquiry\" would be actioned within 10 working days. She cancelled her direct debit and assumed that the account was closed. In January RSL demanded to know how she proposed paying her bills and she reminded them of the cancellation. In February she was told that her line would be disconnected at the end of the month and in May she heard that the account was now closed but she owed them \u00a346 in line rental. Selby pointed out the account should have been closed in December and any subsequent charges were RSL's mistake, but received no reply. \u0095\"It was an oversight,\" pleads RSL. \"A staff member who no longer works here only actioned half the request ... It is unacceptable lack of attention to detail.\" Selby's account has now been cleared and her \u00a315 disconnection fee waived in contrition. Put the receiver down Vira Bhaskar of Cambridge was offered a free trial of a mobile phone by the late lamented telesales firm 1st Line. He rang to terminate the deal within the specified 14-day period and was told his free trial had been extended to two months. A month later 1st Line went into receivership and Bhaskar found himself being billed for line rental by Cellular Ops. As the latter requires a 30-day cancellation notice he'll have to pay another month's rental before he can be shot of the phone. \u0095\"As 1st Line was our dealer and not our agent we are not liable for any concessions, offers or incentives offered by them,\" shrugs Cellular Operations. It points out that customers can write to 1st Line's receivers, Grant Thornton, but, it adds ominously, \"due to the massive debt left owing by 1st Line it is highly unlikely that any claims will be met\". How to hang up Both Sue Allan and Jeremy Minton eventually managed to break free from their respective service providers but say that the process was a nightmare with the companies insisting they'd not received any written communications or failing to act on those they did get. \"The trading standards officer I phoned said that the only certain way of cancelling was to send your letter by registered post,\" says Allan. Oftel advises customers to keep copies of all letters of cancellation and will lend an ear to those who can't resolve their problem with their service provider. Hold on to your SIM When Andy Grandmottet-Shaw's mobile broke down it was dispatched to One2One for repair. Three weeks after it was received back she was sent a bill for \u00a3875 worth of international calls, made while the phone was out of her possession. One2One promised to look into it and the result was a second bill for the same amount. Weeks on, however, everyone at One2One had a different story to tell. \u0095After Consumer jogs its memory One2One says it is waiving all charges. \"If customers send phones back to be repaired they must take their SIM card out, otherwise it's like sending off your handbag with all your credit cards inside,\" warns a spokeswoman. Whose line is it anyway? Meanwhile Rebecca Dowman was wondering why One2One was charging her \u00a3300 for calls made on a phone with a number she doesn't possess. After several days of trying to contact customer services she was assured the error would be rectified, but the demands kept on coming. One2One insisted she report the \"fraud\" to the police, although the problem was evidently due to an account mix up. The police, unsurprisingly, declined to intervene and Dowman resumed her efforts with One2One. The response was a new bill for \u00a3398.36. \u0095One2One declares that the number on which the calls are being made is non-existent, but that somebody's using it. \"Ms Dowman was charged due to an administrative error and we've referred it to our fraud office,\" says a spokeswoman. \"She won't be receiving any more bills.\" More broken promises Back to BT Cellnet, which deemed Julie McGovern's damaged handset irreparable and ordered her a new phone with a different number. Alas, it continued to debit monthly line rental for the disused phone as well as its replacement. BT declared itself unable to refund her but said that, in recompense, it would reactivate her old number and dispatch a new handset free to her partner, Sam Goldie. All Goldie would have to pay would be call charges. But when the phone arrived, Goldie found himself billed for line rental so he sent it back. BT promised to investigate but instead unleashed its debt collection agency which harrassed Goldie into paying \u00a362. Since then he's heard nothing. \u0095\"An admin error was compounded by further errors, which is unacceptable,\" says BT Cellnet. It has now refunded Goldie and McGovern the disputed payments for both phones. Thieves make a call At least there's comfort in company. Hilary Mandleberg's handbag was stolen last January and the thieves used her bank details to open half a dozen One2One accounts. She was told to send the ensuing bills to the fraud department, but the demands continued to flood in. By May she was being threatened by a debt collection agency, yet One2One assured her the problem had been dealt with. Then another agency began harassing her over two more accounts that were supposed to have been cancelled and she has heard nothing more from One2One. \u0095\"It's a terrible mess and it has taken some time to plough through it,\" admits a spokesman who promises that the matter is now \"sorted\". But despite four reminder calls the promised explanation was never sent and Consumer's messages were not replied to. Sound familiar?

On 26 July last year, he and 27 others made a dawn raid on a six-acre GM maize crop being grown by three brothers for seed company Agrevo. They broke into remote Walnut Tree farm, near Lyng, Norfolk, shredded the crops with a lorry and cutting machine and started bagging them up.

In fact, the group argued that they had a legal excuse to uproot the crops because leaving them to flower and pollinate would have led to a greater crime - the contamination of other crops in the vicinity. Similar widespread objections means supermarkets are stepping up the sale of organic food.

In the past, genes were transferred between the same species, but new technology means they can be transferred within different species. In Britain, the Department of the Environment has agreed to 73 sites for GM trials this year. They include 12 spring-sown oilseed rape crops, 12 forage maize crops and 24 beet crops.

      "trailText": "Desmond, who has died aged 80, followed in his father's footsteps enthusiastically, working in Anton Zwemmer's bookshop and gallery and extending the publishing list, already distinguished by the presence of the very first book about Henry Moore and the first   translations of works on Picasso and Matisse.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In his prime, Desmond Zwemmer, six feet-four tall, wearing a widebrimmed black hat and dark overcoat well below the knees, could have been taken for a descendant of a prosperous Rembrandt merchant. An appropriate look, given that he was the elder son of a Dutchman who became London and Britain's leading art bookseller and the man who made Zwemmer's in Charing Cross Road an institution.</p> <p>Desmond, who has died aged 80, followed in his father's footsteps enthusiastically, working in Anton Zwemmer's bookshop and gallery and extending the publishing list, already distinguished by the presence of the very first book about Henry Moore and the first translations of works on Picasso and Matisse.</p> <p>Desmond was born and brought up in Herne Hill, south London, and educated locally. He spent a year at Besan\u00e7on University, perfecting his French and becoming a Francophile, then went on to the Courtauld Institute to study for a degree in the history of art under Anthony Blunt. While there he manned his father's bookstall at the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries, and also went to Paris where he met Picasso and other artists.</p> <p>In September 1939, with war imminent, he was across the Channel looking at Romanesque churches. Architecture was a lifelong passion: later he never travelled without the relevant volumes of Pevsner. War interrupted his studies, and in 1940 the gallery was closed and Desmond was called up. He spent what was described as \"a quiet war\" as an army officer on the North-West Frontier, in the Lebanon and, finally, in occupied Germany.</p> <p>Back in Charing Cross Road, his time was divided between the bookshop, into which he introduced remainders, thus raising some highbrow eyebrows, and the gallery, where he became disenchanted by contemporary trends in art.</p> <p>He was more drawn to publishing and so spent three months in Geneva working with his father's old friend, Albert Skira. Home again he began attending book sales to gain knowledge of the antiquarian market and also enrolled for a three-year course at the London College of Printing. The market for art books, as his father had found prewar, was narrow. Desmond went on the road to sell the list, with abysmal results.</p> <p>But in time the market improved, thanks mainly to the efforts of Bela Horowitz, of Phaidon, Walter Neurath of Thames and Hudson and Paul Hamlyn (briefly a wartime employee at Zwemmer's). Desmond realised there was a need for a range of books on architecture and appointed Anthony Blunt and Ralph Wittkower to edit a widely acclaimed series. His father was delighted and declared it would make Desmond a \"real\" publisher compared to himself, who dealt mainly in buying foreign rights and in co-editions.</p> <p>The company could now afford to indulge the younger Zwemmer's insistence on the highest standards of production, illustration and editing, because the retail side of business, managed by Desmond's younger brother, John, was prospering. \"Publishing\", historian Nigel Halliday was to record, \"was a sideline not required to contribute to profits, although politely requested not to drain them either.\" Desmond understood: he was also a businessman.</p> <p>Following Anton's retirement, Zwemmer's bought the Lund Humphries imprint and with it, John Taylor, whom Desmond had met at evening classes. The Gallery was closed and the main bookshop moved to its former site in Litchfield Street because of a development threat to Charing Cross Road.</p> <p>In 1985 the Zwemmer brothers sold the family firm to Philip Wilson after Desmond had suffered a stroke. By then he had married for the second time. His new wife was Ann Beedell, a former social worker, who had opened a bookshop in Bristol. It amused Desmond who, at Zwemmer's, had tended to leave bookselling to brother John, to escape to Bristol at weekends and assist Ann on the floor of her shop. A few years on, when she sold it, she helped him in London, and accompanied him to the Frankfurt Book Fair, an annual event in which he revelled.</p> <p>Desmond did not play a prominent role on the councils or committees of either the Publishers' Association or the Booksellers' Association and I cannot recall that he ever spoke in public. Yet he was most congenial company. He loved travelling, walking and gardening until the illness of his last years, which, at least, shielded him from the knowledge that Wilson had been forced to re-sell Zwemmer's, even though the name still remains on the shop fascia.</p> <p>The monuments to Desmond's work are Nigel Halliday's impeccably produced history of Zwemmer's, More Than a Bookshop, a title taken from Henry Moore's accolade, and an archive which includes catalogues, correspondence and drawings, now happily secure at the Tate Gallery.</p> <p>He is survived by Ann and a daughter from his first marriage.</p> <p>Desmond Zwemmer, publisher and bookseller, born December 6 1919; died September 8 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "In his prime, Desmond Zwemmer, six feet-four tall, wearing a widebrimmed black hat and dark overcoat well below the knees, could have been taken for a descendant of a prosperous Rembrandt merchant. An appropriate look, given that he was the elder son of a Dutchman who became London and Britain's leading art bookseller and the man who made Zwemmer's in Charing Cross Road an institution. Desmond, who has died aged 80, followed in his father's footsteps enthusiastically, working in Anton Zwemmer's bookshop and gallery and extending the publishing list, already distinguished by the presence of the very first book about Henry Moore and the first translations of works on Picasso and Matisse. Desmond was born and brought up in Herne Hill, south London, and educated locally. He spent a year at Besan\u00e7on University, perfecting his French and becoming a Francophile, then went on to the Courtauld Institute to study for a degree in the history of art under Anthony Blunt. While there he manned his father's bookstall at the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries, and also went to Paris where he met Picasso and other artists. In September 1939, with war imminent, he was across the Channel looking at Romanesque churches. Architecture was a lifelong passion: later he never travelled without the relevant volumes of Pevsner. War interrupted his studies, and in 1940 the gallery was closed and Desmond was called up. He spent what was described as \"a quiet war\" as an army officer on the North-West Frontier, in the Lebanon and, finally, in occupied Germany. Back in Charing Cross Road, his time was divided between the bookshop, into which he introduced remainders, thus raising some highbrow eyebrows, and the gallery, where he became disenchanted by contemporary trends in art. He was more drawn to publishing and so spent three months in Geneva working with his father's old friend, Albert Skira. Home again he began attending book sales to gain knowledge of the antiquarian market and also enrolled for a three-year course at the London College of Printing. The market for art books, as his father had found prewar, was narrow. Desmond went on the road to sell the list, with abysmal results. But in time the market improved, thanks mainly to the efforts of Bela Horowitz, of Phaidon, Walter Neurath of Thames and Hudson and Paul Hamlyn (briefly a wartime employee at Zwemmer's). Desmond realised there was a need for a range of books on architecture and appointed Anthony Blunt and Ralph Wittkower to edit a widely acclaimed series. His father was delighted and declared it would make Desmond a \"real\" publisher compared to himself, who dealt mainly in buying foreign rights and in co-editions. The company could now afford to indulge the younger Zwemmer's insistence on the highest standards of production, illustration and editing, because the retail side of business, managed by Desmond's younger brother, John, was prospering. \"Publishing\", historian Nigel Halliday was to record, \"was a sideline not required to contribute to profits, although politely requested not to drain them either.\" Desmond understood: he was also a businessman. Following Anton's retirement, Zwemmer's bought the Lund Humphries imprint and with it, John Taylor, whom Desmond had met at evening classes. The Gallery was closed and the main bookshop moved to its former site in Litchfield Street because of a development threat to Charing Cross Road. In 1985 the Zwemmer brothers sold the family firm to Philip Wilson after Desmond had suffered a stroke. By then he had married for the second time. His new wife was Ann Beedell, a former social worker, who had opened a bookshop in Bristol. It amused Desmond who, at Zwemmer's, had tended to leave bookselling to brother John, to escape to Bristol at weekends and assist Ann on the floor of her shop. A few years on, when she sold it, she helped him in London, and accompanied him to the Frankfurt Book Fair, an annual event in which he revelled. Desmond did not play a prominent role on the councils or committees of either the Publishers' Association or the Booksellers' Association and I cannot recall that he ever spoke in public. Yet he was most congenial company. He loved travelling, walking and gardening until the illness of his last years, which, at least, shielded him from the knowledge that Wilson had been forced to re-sell Zwemmer's, even though the name still remains on the shop fascia. The monuments to Desmond's work are Nigel Halliday's impeccably produced history of Zwemmer's, More Than a Bookshop, a title taken from Henry Moore's accolade, and an archive which includes catalogues, correspondence and drawings, now happily secure at the Tate Gallery. He is survived by Ann and a daughter from his first marriage. Desmond Zwemmer, publisher and bookseller, born December 6 1919; died September 8 2000",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown failed to persuade the former Treasury minister Geoffrey Robinson not to write his memoirs, although he feared the book would fuel the internal rows undermining Labour's authority. The chancellor put pressure on the millionaire MP for Coventry North West to stay silent and abandon plans to publish his inside story of his time in government and the run-up to the last election. Mr Robinson, a close friend of Mr Brown and a guest at his wedding celebrations on Monday night, refused but did agree to delay publication until after next week's conference at Brighton to avoid overshadowing the event. The release next month of the former paymaster-general's book, The Unconventional Minister, is expected to include his side of the \u00a3373,000 home loan to Peter Mandelson, which cost both men their government posts. Whitehall officials said the chancellor told the prime minister last week that the spate of books on the government was chipping away at its credibility, exposing rifts and concentrating public attention on personalities rather than policies. Journalist Julia Langdon's biography of Mo Mowlam, written with the Cabinet Office minister's cooperation, gave details of the feuds between Labour's most popular figure and Mr Mandelson and Mr Brown as well as her rift with Mr Blair after she was removed from Northern Ireland. Columnist Andrew Rawnsley's version of life in the government has led to Mr Blair and Mr Brown being accused of lying about the \u00a31m donation which the Formula 1 magnate Bernie Ecclestone made to Labour. Mr Blair was interviewed twice by Mr Rawnsley but advisers at No 10 denied he gave the author explosive information or criticised his colleagues. They said the prime minister defended the government's record and presented a picture of a relatively united team. Mr Rawnsley also saw Mr Blair to check information. Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's press spokesman, and his assistant, Phillip Bassett, were present taking notes. He interviewed Anji Hunter, the personal assistant to Mr Blair, and the head of the No 10 policy unit, David Miliband. He interviewed Mr Mandelson and his former special adviser, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser. Former senior civil servants, including some in the Treasury, were interviewed. Mr Rawnsley has threatened to reveal sources if he is challenged in the courts or faces a full effort to damage his account. The chancellor's private assessment will be seen as a tacit admission that it was a mistake to give his cooperation to a biography of him two years ago which claimed he still resented Mr Blair inheriting the Labour leadership. Mr Robinson's book is due to be serialised in the Mail on Sunday, which is believed to have paid around \u00a3200,000. Mr Robinson, who was forced to resign shortly before Christmas 1998 after the loan to Mr Mandelson was exposed, is understood to have given up hope of returning as a minister. Mr Blair brought back Mr Mandelson within a year when he handed him Ms Mowlam's Northern Ireland portfolio and put him jointly in charge, with Mr Brown, of Labour's election planning. The Northern Ireland secretary got his version of the loan into print in Donald Macintyre's recently updated biography and is said by associates to fear it could be challenged by Mr Robinson. Downing Street shared Mr Brown's anxiety over Mr Robinson's book and Ms Hunter, a long term aide of the premier, was deputised to keep in close contact with Mr Robinson. The Blair family holidayed in his Tuscan villa and Cannes flat before an offshore trust and \u00a312m inheritance from the car dealer Joska Bourgeois were uncovered. Mr Robinson has also been dogged by allegations about his business dealings and relationship with the former Mirror publisher Robert Maxwell.

T-Online shares yesterday hit an all-time low of E25.60 (1539p) on Frankfurt's Neuermarkt Nemax 50 index, against their April flotation price of E27 (1624p).",

The acquisition will lead to the creation of a new company, Classic Gold Digital, which will be 80% owned by UBC and 20% owned by GWR. The deal gives the company access to a digital simulcast channel. UBC has secured carriage on seven digital multiplexes. UBC, formerly known as Unique Broadcasting, made its name as producer of the Pepsi Network Chart.

The European commission was pushing for some kind of EU-wide fuel tax but Lord Macdonald was unwilling even to discuss the matter. \"This meeting is about transport policy and not taxation,\" he said before talks began. The meeting was called by France at the height of the fuel protests but it looked unlikely last night that it would produce any kind of significant agreement and many ministers said they thought it had been convened too late. The European commission has launched an inquiry to see whether concessions granted by Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands breach EU state aid rules. If they do, tax breaks and payments of state aid to truckers and others across Europe in recent weeks will have to be cancelled and repayment demanded.",

But the Wen Ho Lee case has had a far more potent and far-reaching effect than a bit of reshuffling in the law enforcement community. It has aroused the wrath of the country's most self-effacing and soft-spoken minority, Asian-Americans. The whole episode may become for Asian-Americans what the Dreyfus case was for French Jews a century ago. In both cases, the elites of their respective communities were jolted out of a complacent optimism over their prospects for assimilation by an outrageous injustice inflicted on one of their own. Alfred Dreyfus was framed as a spy. Wen Ho Lee was simply assumed to be one. He was kept in solitary confinement for nine months, with his hands and feet shackled, while facing 59 national security charges. The press quoted government officials as asserting that the 60-year-old Taiwanese-born scientist was a \"suspected Chinese spy\". But last week, 58 of the charges simply melted away, and Lee was allowed to go home, facing only one count of mishandling classified material. The reaction of many Asian-Americans was instructive. While rejoicing in Lee's release, they were angry about the deal which freed him. In the eyes of many activists, as Chisun Lee pointed out in the New York magazine the Village Voice, the national security establishment escaped by \"not having to address accusations of selective prosecution, racial profiling, xenophobic rhetoric and unconstitutional manoeuvring\". The case and the surrounding furore have helped smash the comfortable assumption that Asian-Americans were by and large allowed to go about their business unmolested in US society. In fact, it turned out that Lee's apparently selective prosecution (there was a list of non-Asians at Los Alamos suspected of similar offences who were never charged) was par for the course for an embattled community. A survey found that over 70% of young Asian-Americans claimed to have been illegally stopped and searched by the police, who had no cause for suspicion other than the colour of the suspects' faces and the shape of their eyes. Before the Lee case there was a cautious confidence among Asian-Americans that the dark days of mass internment during the second world war were long gone and they were beginning to be accepted as ordinary citizens. That confidence has now been punctured. In Time magazine this week, Howard Chua-Eoan observes: \"We are not yet considered part of the American context - our presence is unidiomatic, all too easily aped, too often perceived as too alien to be appreciated as anything other than caricature.\" Although African-Americans have not done nearly as well educationally or economically, they are generally acknowledged by their white neighbours as fellow Americans. That acceptance is far more guarded when it comes to US citizens of Asian extraction. Matt Fong, a Californian Republican running for the Senate two years ago, continually found himself running into the brick wall of racial suspicion on the campaign trail. Even though his family had been Americans for four generations, journalists frequently asked him where his loyalties would lie if China attacked the US. The root of the trouble may be that Asian-Americans are perpetually associated with the \"Chinese threat\" - the only remnant of the Cold War that Americans still take seriously. Lee's arrest stemmed from the belief that the Beijing had managed to steal US weapons secrets, triggering a sense of panic and paranoia in Washington. That belief has since been challenged, and many of the assumptions underlying this seemingly straightforward spy story are being questioned.

Police sources at the scene indicated that the blast was likely to be a bomb \u0097 saying they were treating it as \u0093very suspicious\u0094. But there was minimal damage to the building and there were no reports of casualties. One source said it appeared that there had been an impact high up on the outside of the building on the side furthest from the Thames, suggesting a possible mortar attack. Firefighters were called to the Vauxhall Cross area at 9.52pm last night, and immediately sealed off the area. Late last night police had thrown a 250-yard cordon around the building. River police were also said to be patrolling nearby. Witnesses described hearing two loud explosions.

      "body": "<p>Recently I spent two months in France as the winner of the Robert Louis Stevenson 2000 award for writers. I stayed at Hotel Chevillon in Grez-sur-Loing, a picturesque riverside village set in the Fontainebleau forest, just south-east of Paris. In the late 19th century, Chevillon was home to an international community of artists and it was there that Stevenson first met Fanny Osbourne, a vivacious American 12 years his senior. Later he would follow her to America where they married.</p> <p>I loved the story of the star-crossed lovers' first meeting in Chevillon. But there'd be no such distractions for me; a fortysomething novelist with a loving partner and a tribe of grown children left behind in Glasgow. I was there to write, in solitude.</p> <p>I worked hard but missed switching off my computer and strolling along to the nearest cafe bar at 5 o'clock every day. I found a Tabac in the village where I could have coffee or cognac, depending on how my writing had gone that day. The other customers quickly dismissed me as one of les artistes and, apart from the occasional \"Bonjour Madame\", I was left alone.</p> <p>It was in the Tabac that I first observed that the woman who ran the place with her husband and daughter was approximately my age. Dressed for work in trousers and shirt, she looked elegant, chic and sexy. One day her granddaughter, an angelic three-year-old named Ophille, made a grand entrance, twirling around in her new summer frock. Madame applauded loudly: \"Tr\u00e8s belle, ma ch\u00e9rie ... Jolie enfant.\"</p> <p>The child glowed. And I realised that, determined that my own little granddaughter would never be \"just a pretty face\", I made a point of telling her she was a big clever girl but never told her she was beautiful. Would she ever, like the luminous Ophille, glow with the knowledge of her own loveliness, handed down from her grandmother like a precious heirloom or family recipe?</p> <p>I took the 10-minute bus ride to Fontainebleau. After a visit to the palace and a peek at Napoleon's tiny bed, I wandered through the town. In Rue de la Come I found the English bookshop and coffee bar. I bought a secondhand volume of Virginia Woolf's letters and went out with my coffee to a pavement table. My book lay neglected on the tabletop as I gazed at the women passing by, the women around me. Some of them were my age or older, but like Madame back in Grez, chic and sexy. The phrase that sprung to mind was well cared for.</p> <p>I hadn't cared for myself in that way for a long time. But when and why had I stopped? A lifelong feminist, I believed Gloria Steinem had the right idea; there was damn-all wrong with female adornment, as long as it was my choice. I wore jeans and white shirts, tailored jackets and boots, and I had long, streaked, tousled hair. One night I was introduced to Billy Connolly in a Glasgow bar and he said I had the look of Goldie Hawn. My daughter said: \"It's well seen he's a comedian.\" I laughed.</p> <p>In my early 40s I began to put on weight, middle-aged spread, and with my more voluptuous figure, I would have put the Big Yin more in mind of the chunky one from Status Quo if I'd stuck with my rock chick look. But I couldn't find a new look for me. Faced with a high street lined with Miss Selfridge, Top Shop and Kookai, a little voice in my head would whisper: \"There's nothing for you here. Grow up, Maggie, you're a granny.\"</p> <p>And I listened. I had my hair cut and lived in loose tops, baggy pants and long skirts. I hardly ever went shopping and when I did I would buy clothes and toys for my grandchild.</p> <p>So why hadn't these middle-aged Frenchwomen given up? And where did they buy their seemingly effortless style? I discovered the town was free of shops selling only minuscule garments in size six with the midriffs missing. Instead there were little boutiques and lingerie shops. I found Monoprix with an entire floor selling affordable clothes and cosmetics to suit me. Yes, middle-aged, size 14 on a good day, wee granny me. I went back to Grez with my literary letters, lacy underwear, a linen shirt and a lipstick.</p> <p>In Grez I made some friends, Corinne and Fran\u00e7oise, both over 50 and both stunning. Corrine, a vivacious redhead, had, like me, lived in Ayrshire in the late 60s. We discovered we had gone to the same dance halls. Fran\u00e7oise had been an au pair in London around the same time and had lived in Aberdeen. I visited their homes for lunches and in the early evenings for aperitifs. I will never forget Corinne, just back from work, shrugging out of her raincoat, kicking off her shoes and saying: \"Would a glass of champagne be OK?\"</p> <p>The three of us visited Chambrolle chateaux and museum de parfum. I bought a Salvador Dali fragrance in a bottle shaped like a man's nose and a woman's lips. For myself. I was having fun. Lingerie, perfume and 5 o'clock champagne were all very pleasurable and I wanted more.</p> <p>I stopped sitting on my hands and began giving myself regular manicures. I had my hair restyled and coloured, with Fran\u00e7oise relaying instructions to the stylist. I bought a soft leather bag and some silk scarves from a street market. The French have no youth culture that tells women it's fine to grow older as long as you don't look it, dearie. I had stayed young-looking for a long time. I was a teenage bride, a young mother and as a mature student I had mixed with younger people, bought my clothes from Oxfam and hung around the Union just like them. And I was confident, known around the English department as \"that cocky bitch\".</p> <p>But when I began to look my age, I lost that confidence. I was no longer a size 10 and no one mistook me for my children's sister any more. Germaine Greer wanted me to wait around for cronehood and the media presented with me Tina Turner for a role model. Not fancying either, I simply stopped paying attention, wimped out and became invisible.</p> <p>In France I began to enjoy \"myself\" again. I visited Paris and as I wandered around with my copy of Women of the Left Bank, searching for the houses where Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein and Ana\u00efs Nin had lived, I noticed that men were looking at me.

      "bodyText": "Concern was raised yesterday over inconsistencies in the way teachers accused of assaulting pupils were dealt with after one woman teacher was brought before magistrates while a second was given a caution. Jean Meldrum, 55, was in the dock at Newark magistrates' court for allegedly slapping a 10-year-old pupil across the face when he wrongly marked a maths test. Meanwhile, it emerged that teacher Susan Cann was interviewed but only cautioned by Dyfed Powys police for allegedly jabbing eight-year-old Rhys Thomas with a ballpoint pen. The cases come hard on the heels of that of headteacher Marjorie Evans, who was acquitted on appeal over allegations that she had slapped a pupil at another south Wales school. Mrs Meldrum allegedly struck the boy on his right cheek while teaching year six pupils at a junior school in the Newark area of Nottinghamshire. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court that the pupils were asked to mark a maths test. He said: \"Mrs Meldrum gave instructions on how to mark it. She said to put a number one in the box. She was sat in front of me on the table. \"She gave the answer to the question. I was used to ticking questions, so I ticked it. She said 'Listen' and that is when she slapped me.\" The boy admitted he was annoyed that Mrs Meldrum had kept him in at morning break that day after he failed to complete his spelling homework correctly, but claimed she slapped him before telling him she was keeping him in. Dona Parry-Jones, prosecuting, said: \"There is no doubt Mrs Meldrum is a dedicated teacher, well respected and liked by parents, but is also known to be strict.\" She added: \"It wasn't in self-defence, not even in exasperation, but because he made a small mistake.\" Mrs Meldrum denied slapping any children during her 22 years of teaching and said she had never slapped her own children. She denies assault and the trial continues. Mrs Cann, a teacher at Saron county primary school in Ammanford, west Wales, was interviewed and only cautioned by Dyfed Powys police following a complaint by Rhys's parents Robert and Helen Thomas. Rhys is said to have been \"messing about\" in class and it is claimed that after he poked another boy with his pencil, Mrs Cann jabbed him with her pen about four times. The crown prosecution service wrote to the boy's parents saying it would not be in the public interest to take the case to court. The letter, from Mike Edwards, principal prosecutor for the CPS in the Dyfed Powys area, said that although the injuries claimed to have been suffered by Rhys were nasty and distressing to him they were not of a very serious nature. The letter added: \"Further, Mrs Cann expressed remorse for her actions both when interviewed by the police and I understand when she spoke to yourselves immediately after the incident. \"In the circumstances it was considered appropriate to deal with the case by way of a caution.\" Mrs Thomas said the family were unhappy that the teacher had not been suspended and that the case had not gone to court. She demanded to know why cases such as the Marjorie Evans one went to court but her son's had not. \"The CPS appear to be using different rules,\" she said. Speaking on behalf of Mrs Cann, NUT spokesman David Evans said: \"The NUT is satisfied that what we consider to be a minor incident has been fully investigated by the police and the governing body at the school.\"",

He claimed not to have worked too hard at his craft. \"He lived for a great martini,\" remarked his daughter, Julie Anhalt Rice.</p> <p>When Anhalt was under contract to Paramount from 1961 to 1965, he devised a way of dealing with Hal Wallis, the head of the studio, who would roam the corridors of the writers' building listening for sounds of creativity. Anhalt simply played a tape of the sound of a busy typewriter whenever Wallis passed by. His Oscar-winning Best Screenplay, written under Wallis's aegis, was Becket (1964), rather deftly adapted from Jean Anouilh's chronicle play, though the characters, Thomas \u00e0 Becket (Richard Burton) and King Henry II (Peter O'Toole), were revealed more through talk than action.</p> <p>His less prestigious work for the studio included the Elvis Presley vehicle Girls! Girls! Girls! (1962), in which the star played a poor tuna fisherman, and Boeing Boeing (1965), which Anhalt fashioned from Marc Camoletti's farce for Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis. Also based on a play, but more personal for Anhalt, was Wives and Lovers (1963), about a successful writer (Van Johnson) on the brink of divorce.</p> <p>Anhalt was married to his first wife Edna for 20 years, during which time they were writing partners. They began by churning out short stories for pulp magazines, under the pseudonym of Andrew Holt, and their first screenplay, credited to Holt, was Strange Voyage (1946), a lively \"B\" adventure directed by Irving Allen.</p> <p>In 1950, under their real names, the Anhalts' won an Academy Award for Original Story for Elia Kazan's gripping urban thriller, Panic in the Streets, about the hunt for a gang of petty criminals carrying pneumonic plague. The couples' screenwriting breakthrough came with Fred Zinnemann's The Member of the Wedding (1952), adapted from Carson McCullers' successful Broadway play. It contained an \"opened-out\" sequence, not in the play, in which unhappy, reclusive adolescent Julie Harris goes to town and is pestered by a drunken GI. The film was produced by Stanley Kramer, for whom the couple continued to work.</p> <p>Their Oscar-nominated story for Edward Dmytryk's taut psychological police drama The Sniper (1952), about a man who shoots women from rooftops, was based on research they did among men who were convicted of violent crimes against women. Anhalt later revisited similar territory with the much slicker The Boston Strangler (1968).</p> <p>It was while writing the script for Kramer's first directorial effort, the laboured medical drama Not as a Stranger (1955), based on Morton Thompson's thick bestseller, that the Anhalts began to battle with Columbia Studios and each other, leading to their divorce.</p> <p>The last film Edward and Edna worked on together was Kramer's sprawling 130-minute epic, The Pride and the Passion (1957), for which they provided the empty rhetorical dialogue delivered without conviction by the miscast trio of Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren.</p> <p>Anhalt's first solo screenplay was for Dmytryk's The Young Lions (1958), based on the second world war novel by Irwin Shaw. On Marlon Brando's insistence, Anhalt had to soften the Nazi character, but the writer was instrumental in getting Dean Martin cast in his first non-comic role. In Love and War (1958) also contrasted the effects of the second world war on three soldiers, but this time in a soap opera manner. Even more sudsy was The Restless Years (1958), a Peyton-Place type story featuring blonde teen idol Sandra Dee, and The Sins of Rachel Cade (1961) starring Angie Dickinson as an African missionary. Juvenile delinquency was the fashionable theme of John Frankenheimer's The Young Savages (1961), with a banal message rammed home about social conditions, but at least co-writer Anhalt got to grips with more realistic dialogue.</p> <p>In his effective screenplay for Hour of the Gun (1967), directed by John Sturges, Anhalt (who appears briefly as a medic) takes up the Western story after the gunfight at the OK Corral, giving it a bitter, violent tone, making Wyatt Earp (James Garner) a cold-blooded killer and Doc Holliday (Jason Robards) ever more whisky-sodden. Another Western, which gained Anhalt a Western Hall of Fame award, although co-written with John Milius, was Sydney Pollack's Jeremiah Johnston (1972). The best of the cycle of \"wilderness\" movies of the early 70s, it starred a hirsute Robert Redford as a trapper trying to survive in the mountains, where hostile Indians lurk.

Truckers and farmers all over Europe are protesting. This confirms that the recent cost increases in Britain owe more to the rise in prices charged by the oil companies than to anything that the British government has done. It also demonstrates that whatever happens to fuel duties, we need to address the fundamental problems of unjustified fluctuations in world oil prices.</p> <p>In 1990 in the run-up to the Gulf war, the oil companies pushed up the price of petrol and claimed it was because of inexorable market forces which had forced up the worldwide price of crude oil. As shadow energy secretary, I set up Labour's petrol price monitoring unit. This exposed the truth, eventually accepted by nearly every commentator not in the pocket of the oil industry, that the increases owed little to a shortage of oil and a great deal to profiteering by the oil companies.</p> <p>They are at it again. The impression the oil industry has created is that there is a shortage of oil which has increased the world price and that the companies are innocent victims of market forces. Oh yeah!</p> <p>Let's look at the facts. Figures from the International Energy Agency show that the world production of crude oil in August this year was higher than in 1998. Yet in 1998 the average crude oil price was just $12.52 per barrel compared with $34 per barrel today. Over and above the August production figures, output is expected to rise by 1.7m barrels per day or 2.2% of total world production. Some 0.8m of these extra barrels have been promised by OPEC and a further 0.94m extra barrels are expected from non-OPEC countries. So production shortages, or fear of production shortages, can't be the explanation. The companies also claim that oil stocks are low. They don't mention that the stocks that are low are mainly their stocks and that it was they who decided to stock less.</p> <p>The oil companies also claim that oil consumption has risen as a result of economic expansion. Surely an effective global oil system should be able to respond without needing huge price increases.</p> <p>No one can safely say whether there is an oil shortage because although production figures are available worldwide, storage and consumption figures are not. So the world is laid open to the effects of rumours and propaganda from speculators who usually lay the blame for price increases on OPEC. This badly managed cartel must take some of the blame - but only some.</p> <p>Most people have the impression that the world depends overwhelmingly on OPEC for its oil supplies. Not so. Only 40% of the world's oil supplies come from OPEC countries. They make up only four of the top 10 producers. Saudi Arabia leads with 8.2m barrels a day, but is closely followed by the US on 8.1m and Russia on 6.5m. Combined Norwegian and UK production from the North Sea totalled 6.3m barrels a day in the first quarter of this year, although it had fallen to 5.7m by August.</p> <p>The North Sea also illustrates that the cost of producing oil hasn't risen much since 1998, yet the oil companies are getting nearly three times as much money for every barrel they produce there. And that is broadly true the world over - it is the price of crude that has risen, not the cost of producing it.</p> <p>So who is getting the extra money? The answer is the oil companies. They produce the oil. They transport it. They store it (or don't store it). They refine it. They retail it. Above all, they buy and sell it. Oil trading is done by oil companies and speculators. No Martians are involved. The price of oil and oil products is what the oil companies pay and get paid. That is why they run up such huge extra profits during periods when oil prices are high. This is harming the rest of us because it means that the oil sector is taking a much bigger share from the world's economy.</p> <p>The impact of this on Britain and Europe is there for all to see, but it pales into insignificance compared with its impact on Africa. Nigeria and Libya may benefit, but to meet the higher oil prices the rest of the African countries face ruinous calls on funds they don't possess. They cannot do without oil. They need more oil to expand and prosper. Yet they simply can't afford it. Countries which were looking forward to better times, with debt written off and increased production and exports, now face being crushed by a mountain of new debt just to pay today's higher fuel bills.</p> <p>Under the present system, consumer countries, both rich and poor, are suffering. Many producer countries, including some members of OPEC, suffer from the economic, fiscal and social uncertainties caused by wild fluctuations in oil prices. The only constant beneficiaries of the present system are the oil companies.</p> <p>Clearly, the present global market in oil isn't working. It is doing the world more harm than good. Almost everyone would benefit from more stability. So I hope that when the G7 meet this weekend, they won't just pressurise OPEC to increase production. What they need to do is to work with oil producers and consumers around the world to develop a structure which provides more stability in the production, transport, storage, refining and distribution of oil and oil products.</p> <p>The present system is unsustainable and needs to be changed. A worldwide, transparent and accountable system should take its place. It would not be perfect, but it would be better than what we have got. It might even be so successful that oil companies in the UK would do everything necessary to keep the forecourts properly supplied.

Perhaps Gordon Brown (see above) should study the fate of Edgar Faure, who stabilised the value of the franc, forcing small businesses to pay last year's taxes in real rather than devalued money.",

Earlier this week he shared his solution with readers of the Independent. \"The correct policy is twofold,\" he announced. First, the government should get tough with the oil companies. Second, it should \"start to reshape its tax policy to shift the balance from indirect to direct taxation\". Oh and petrol prices should be reduced a bit too. Bingo! No over-mighty oil-consumers, cheaper driving, and a lot of happy taxpayers.</p> <p>Explained in this disarmingly can-do way, the route out of chaos sounded so simple that it seemed a shame its author wasn't just a fellow hack but a politician, actually out there in the real world doing something useful. Then I remembered that Ken Livingstone, the columnist and popular after dinner speaker, doubles as Mayor of London. What a bit of luck! Now that he has been in the job for three months he must surely have had time to start transforming London from seething cesspit to the \"sustainable world city\" mentioned in the mayoral manifesto.</p> <p>Although there are, it must be said, no obvious signs of mayorally-induced improvement on the streets of London, that is not to say Ken has been idle. There was that big party at the Tate Modern. He paid tribute to the Queen Mother. Then, only a week or so ago, we heard that his \"instantly recognisable\" disembodied voice will shortly be heard in a new play by Jeffrey Archer. He wants to revive town twinning, teaming London with, among other places, Johannesburg, Dhaka and Dublin. He plans another big party next New Year's Eve. More promisingly, Livingstone will ban birdseed salesmen from Trafalgar Square. Tomorrow he is expected at No Car Day, demonstrating his commitment to traffic reduction.</p> <p>Much of this information appears on Livingstone's new noticeboard, london.gov.uk, a site which fairly throbs with incident and achievement. It also features an archive of the mayor's newspaper columns in which he reports on his triumphs. Recently, for instance, Livingstone was delighted to find himself feted by London's business executives.\"Some 72%\", he crows, \"now say that they think I perform well as 'an ambassador for London'.\" He adds, not unreasonably, that \"the results do not bear out the dire predictions repeated by Tony Blair again and again prior to the election.\"</p> <p>Blair said that Livingstone would be a \"disaster for London\". A complete non-event for London would seem a bit closer to the mark. There is no reason for London executives to feel anything about Livingstone but equanimity, tinged with relief. To date, Livingstone seems to have done little but welcomed this, deplored that, written his column and made appointments to the endless new committees and strategy groups and commissions which are now being put in place to deploy the funds awarded to the GLA by central government. Certainly the great edifice has been rather an expensive way of setting up Livingstone with a new hobby, but as yet, his newts have probably been the only ones to suffer.</p> <p>If Livingstone presses on with his manifesto, this may change. His one significant power, and his only means of raising revenue, is the imposition of a new road tax, the congestion charge, on central London. Is he still as determined to thwart drivers now that the full idiocy and selfish might of their lobby has been revealed? If so, the mayor and his officers may yet justify their existence. If not - and his silence on the conduct of the fuel protesters and belief that the government should tickle their tummies with a reduction of petrol prices both suggest a growing desire to ingratiate himself with motorists, as well as with city executives - then our brand new voice for London may continue to be what it has been so far: an instantly recognisable irrelevance.</p> <p><b>Calling time on Frinton</b></p> <p>* What will we do without Frinton?

How could anyone be more intolerant than the snobby Frintonians, with their endless bylaws and ever-so-genteel \"greensward\"?</p> <p>For many journalists, a piece on the silly ways of silly old Frinton was once as much a part of the training as the obligatory interview with the late Barbara Cartland, and the feature on inebriated toffs.

He said an incident room had been set up and urged the public to be extra vigilant and cautious regarding any suspicious or unexpected packages they received. \"Somebody must know who is doing this, and we urge anybody who knows anything about the matter to contact us.\" The director of security at Tesco, John Purnell, said it remained unclear exactly why the demands were being made. \"Our prime concern is obviously for the safety of our staff, customers and the public generally,\" he said. \"Without hesitation we put it straight into the hands of the police.\" Anyone with information should contact Dorset police on 01202 222 444.",

He said that he found his constituents universally disiillusioned with the government. \"They would like to stick the whole cabinet in the Big Brother house, so they could vote out one every week... though they might draw the line at seeing John Prescott in the shower.\" But he was just as angry with the fuel protesters and \"the anarchy in which a picket decides whether you get the fuel to take your wife to hospital, or for a nurse to visit your grandmother\". As for the Tories, he reserved a special and venemous contempt for them. Many people had felt excluded by 18 years of Tory rule. \"William Hague's rhetoric suggests an even worse kind of exclusiveness. Now it's asylum seekers and Asian doctors singled out for opprobrium.\" With a fierce warning that politics was in danger of becoming irrelevant to people's lives, he sat down. The audience looked faintly numb. They had just been stirred by a Beith speech. They were as startled as they might have done if he had performed a striptease on the bar with Jackie Ballard. But after a few moments they realised their duty and, yes, a little late in the day, Alan Beith, of all people, won a standing ovation from the conference.",

      "body": "<p>It is not a good time to be a nun. Yesterday, Sister Alphonso's demure features were in virtually every newspaper following her conviction in Aberdeen for abusing and humiliating children. Meanwhile, around the globe in India, the distinctive, white-veiled nuns of Mother Teresa's order were under a similar spotlight. A criminal case has been filed against a Sister Francesco for forcing a girl's hand onto a hot plate used for cooking chapatis. Nor are these two isolated events. In Australia and Ireland, many cases have come to light of nuns abusing children. The impression builds up that the Catholic church is riddled with abusing nuns and paedophile priests.</p> <p>The reality appears to be that the proportion of nuns and priests who abuse children is roughly in line with the general population. But that does nothing to diminish the sense of outrage which lingers around cases such as those in Aberdeen and Calcutta.</p> <p>There is a double shock in the idea that a nun could be capable of the kind of cruelty Sister Alphonso meted out to her charges. First, we have been very slow to accept that women are capable of abusing children. It flies in the face of some of our most powerfully held emotional beliefs of women as caring mothers. Female physical aggression has been erased from our image of the \"gentler sex\", because it is on that caring mother image that all of our emotional security is built. If we accept that women can be violent, especially towards children, we have to accept the world as an unsteadier, more dangerous place.</p> <p>Second, Sister Alphonso is a a nun and until a couple of decades ago, we presumed that the lives of religious women and men reflected something, if not all, of their intense idealism. We believed some of what priests and nuns purported to be: altruistically devoted to the wellbeing of others.</p> <p>It is precisely this intense idealism which is often at the root of the problem, argues Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychology at the University of Essex. If someone makes enormous psychological investment in the idealistic aspirations of selflessness, the tensions between the ideal and the reality can sometimes cause a brittleness which can lead to a nun or priest snapping and losing all control, with terrifying consequences. Samuels, a Jungian, argues that every professional vocation has its \"shadow side\".

      "bodyText": "It is not a good time to be a nun. Yesterday, Sister Alphonso's demure features were in virtually every newspaper following her conviction in Aberdeen for abusing and humiliating children. Meanwhile, around the globe in India, the distinctive, white-veiled nuns of Mother Teresa's order were under a similar spotlight. A criminal case has been filed against a Sister Francesco for forcing a girl's hand onto a hot plate used for cooking chapatis. Nor are these two isolated events. In Australia and Ireland, many cases have come to light of nuns abusing children. The impression builds up that the Catholic church is riddled with abusing nuns and paedophile priests. The reality appears to be that the proportion of nuns and priests who abuse children is roughly in line with the general population. But that does nothing to diminish the sense of outrage which lingers around cases such as those in Aberdeen and Calcutta. There is a double shock in the idea that a nun could be capable of the kind of cruelty Sister Alphonso meted out to her charges. First, we have been very slow to accept that women are capable of abusing children. It flies in the face of some of our most powerfully held emotional beliefs of women as caring mothers. Female physical aggression has been erased from our image of the \"gentler sex\", because it is on that caring mother image that all of our emotional security is built. If we accept that women can be violent, especially towards children, we have to accept the world as an unsteadier, more dangerous place. Second, Sister Alphonso is a a nun and until a couple of decades ago, we presumed that the lives of religious women and men reflected something, if not all, of their intense idealism. We believed some of what priests and nuns purported to be: altruistically devoted to the wellbeing of others. It is precisely this intense idealism which is often at the root of the problem, argues Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychology at the University of Essex. If someone makes enormous psychological investment in the idealistic aspirations of selflessness, the tensions between the ideal and the reality can sometimes cause a brittleness which can lead to a nun or priest snapping and losing all control, with terrifying consequences. Samuels, a Jungian, argues that every professional vocation has its \"shadow side\". A well-integrated individual is able to understand and manage the destructive shadow side, someone who is emotionally repressed cannot. The shadow side of teaching is the desire to control, he adds. Control and loss of it is clearly the theme of Sister Alphonso's sad story. In her trial, she complained of too many children to care for, and too few staff. Faced with this pressure, she lost control as her accusers described, with appalling consequences. Her fury and exasperation were expressed as a desire to humiliate - children who wet their beds had their soiled underwear tied around their heads - and to hurt. She has clearly damaged the lives of many people. But her stoical account of her own background is also tragic. As the youngest of 12 children (seven of whom died in infancy), she pulled down her knickers when she had done wrong and asked her father to beat her. During the trial, she used that tell-tale phrase \"I wanted for nothing\" with its connotations of being materially but not emotionally provided for. Brought up on humiliation and deprivation, it is no wonder that she knew how to dispense it. This pattern crops up frequently in the current abuse charges against the church, and perhaps it will in India as more details emerge. For poor children (be they Irish or Indian Untouchables) the Catholic church offered the chance of a decent education and a secure material future. The church's culture of suffering, asceticism and emotional deprivation was already deeply familiar to deprived children and they, in their turn, reinforced it.

His rise to the top of the Labour party was the most effortless in its history.</p> <p>When he got there, he had to fight for reform and take one spectacular risk. But once the abolition of clause four was on the table, he found a party whose desperation for power far exceeded the intensity of its devotion to sacred cows. He did need to be clear-sighted and single-minded. He did not have to endure the travails that harden most leaders, and the voters who watch them, to the horrors that lie ahead.</p> <p>This was an aberrant beginning. It produced a prime minister who in 1997 was unlike just about any leader you could think of. Most must struggle for half a lifetime. They have twisted and schemed and compromised their way to the top. Nobody looks upon them as saints or magic-men. Their frailties abound, their existence is contingent, they never enjoy double-digit opinion poll majorities, sometimes reaching as high as 30%, for a continuous span of six years.</p> <p>What happened to Mr Blair was thoroughly deforming. The scale of his victory extended the easeful pattern. It enabled him and a few colleagues to do what they chose. Whenever he spoke, he could claim the nation was behind him, basking in its relief that he and not someone else was there. Mostly he did not abuse this position, for he is a cautious man. He warned himself and others that there could always be trouble ahead. But he's a dual personality, sceptic and optimist in one. Unbruised by life, he thought that, once he decided to will it, anything not only could but should be done. And now this insouciance has been shattered for ever. Instead of being protected by his magic - his innocence, his untouchability - all events conspire against him.</p> <p>Only a new leader of such rare and self-deceiving stamp would have built the Millennium Dome. The dome was Ceausescu-land, a monument shoring up the fantasies of an old regime. Blair didn't need it. Some of us saw at an early moment what would go wrong. It would have been obvious to a more hardened leader that the upside benefit could never match the downside risk. Instead, he coupled it, with prodigal innocence, into the zeitgeist he thought he was shaping. Now the magic balloon has burst, the dome stands as the ugliest piece of evidence against him.</p> <p>A similar aura of grandiose folly surrounds the resuscitated story of Bernie Ecclestone's millions. The innocence here is more corrosive. It is not believable, on the basis of the Treasury's as well as Andrew Rawnsley's evidence, that Gordon Brown was telling the perfect truth about his knowledge of this at the time, or is doing so now in his tortuous explanations. But why bother to wriggle out of accepting that Ecclestone was a fat donor? Because Mr Blair, still accustomed to walking on water, was somehow not then supposed to be that sort of political leader, and his party, while seeking the support of big business, not that sort of party.</p> <p>How absurd! How pathetically naive! And how damaging. For these wrigglings poison the central claim that always tested anyone's credulity, the notion that Blair and Brown's decision to press for exempting formula one from a ban on tobacco advertising had nothing to do with Ecclestone's donation. This donor is pretty much a single-issue fellow. As he explained to Tom Baldwin, who broke the original story: \"I thought Blair had the same ideas as me, that he was anti-Europe and anti-common market.\" Ecclestone doesn't seem exactly alongside the whole visionary project. He didn't switch from the Tories to Labour in January 1997 for any reason other than calculated self-interest, however defined. And Blair suddenly found this coincided with the national interest, however defined: which it perfectly well may have done.</p> <p>The main effect of two weeks' turmoil and revelation is not to prove Mr Blair is a villain, but to remove him from his sainted pedestal of invulnerability. He has become an ordinary leader. His standing is no longer unique. He's now down on the mat, where his majority will continue to be quite big enough to pass the laws the House of Lords permits, but will no longer guarantee his position in the country. He has to grapple with other leaders from a position where his superior credibility is no longer, as assumed since 1997, guaranteed. In this climate of new realism, where no leader is exempt from chronic mistrust, three adjustments to his trajectory seem essential.</p> <p>First, he needs more gravitas. He is still, after all, the national leader. Man-of-the-people blokeishness is wasted on people who no longer need to be reassured that this isn't a demigod come among them. The worst of his handling of the petrol blockade wasn't his arrogance but his bewilderment. Apart from saying, admirably, that bullyboys would not extract ransom from the elected government, he didn't seem to know what to do. With the oil companies he completely failed, in public, to speak for a sense of national outrage.</p> <p>Mr Blair is, at heart, a serious leader, in a different visionary league from anyone else at the top of politics. One of the effects of his being dragged down to earth ought to be to show that in a contest about policy and leadership, rather than bogus sanctity and fickle charisma, he far surpasses William Hague, leaving Charles Kennedy and the Liberal Democrats to pick up the not insubstantial electorate that has given up on the seductions of \"strong\" leadership of any kind. But first the real leader must retrieve the outward signs of superiority.</p> <p>Second, he needs to show better proof that he can constructively listen. Solidarity has become a neglected value in the Labour scheme of things. Having established the proper resistance to truckers' force majeure , the leader needs to do much more than send down rigid commands from on high. That mode comes from his period of untouchability, which is now well and truly over. There is such a thing as a whole society. If the government can't find a route, from the plethora of tax opportunities, towards some marginal improvement in the cost of fuel, and skewer the Tories as tailgating behind the energy of the mob, then the Treasury must truly have lost a lot of imagination.</p> <p>Third, for Labour to climb back where it deserves to be, the Blair-Brown tensions have to end. This may be a good effect of the pasting Mr Brown took this week. The two men have never had any disagreements, on any subject, that normal people couldn't sort out. But big-beast politicians aren't wholly normal people. The whole trade courts psychological flaws. Gordon Brown, right now, needs all the support he can find, and should be seeking it in a less abrasive relationship between his entourage and his neighbour's. They will succeed or fail together, like all chancellors and prime ministers in the time before, as some innocently imagined, the old politics died.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugo.young@compuserve.com\">hugo.young@compuserve.com</a></p>",

The two men have never had any disagreements, on any subject, that normal people couldn't sort out. But big-beast politicians aren't wholly normal people. The whole trade courts psychological flaws. Gordon Brown, right now, needs all the support he can find, and should be seeking it in a less abrasive relationship between his entourage and his neighbour's. They will succeed or fail together, like all chancellors and prime ministers in the time before, as some innocently imagined, the old politics died. hugo.young@compuserve.com",

      "bodyText": "New evidence that high voltage power lines cause cancer by making particles of pollution stick to people's lungs has been uncovered by a team from Bristol University. The team's research shows that car exhaust particles get an electrical charge from overhead power lines that makes them \"sticky\" - giving people living close to the lines two or three times the average daily dose of potentially damaging pollutants in their lungs. David Henshaw of Bristol University said the discovery is the missing link that shows how power lines can cause cancer clusters - something the global electricity industry has spent millions of pounds researching without finding a conclusive answer. His work is supported by Dr Alan Preece at the Bristol Medical School, whose independent research in the west country showed that people living up to 500 metres downwind of power lines have a 29% greater chance of contracting lung cancer. This finding matches the area where \"sticky\" particles from car exhausts drift downwind of power cables. Both men believe that building new houses near power cables, or allowing new power lines near houses should be stopped until their research is investigated. A ban already exists in US and Sweden. The scientists have been backed by William Hague, the Tory leader. Northallerton, in his constituency, has an unexplained cancer cluster next to a power line. Work to find a link between power lines and cancer has been going on for 20 years, but scientists have been studying a different possible cause - the effect of the magnetic field created by the lines. What Prof Henshaw's team found was not a direct effect on the body, but an indirect mechanical effect, which allowed the build up of pollutants in the lungs. Measurements taken all over the UK and Europe showed that all power lines were surrounded by a corona of electrically charged ions. The older and rougher the lines, the greater the corona. Ions from the corona were carried downwind of the lines, attaching themselves to up to 15,000 particles per cubic metre of pollution floating past in the air. The ions gave the particles an electrical charge and made them stick to surfaces. When they got into the capillaries in the lungs they were attracted to the surface and stuck. Prof Henshaw said: \"This would not happen if the lines were buried. We have the technology to do it , it is just more expensive.\" Dr Preece, an epidemiologist in the oncology department at Bristol will tell Radio 4's Costing the Earth programme today that he looked at the incidence of cancer in the whole of the south-west of England to judge the relative risk for those living within 400 metres of power lines. \"We found an excess, particularly lung cancer, in that group of people, who had been living within 400 metres of a line at the time of diagnosis.\" He said the most surprising element was the cancers only occurred downwind. Dr Preece would not discuss his findings in detail until they had been reviewed by other scientists but a report to the Bioelectromagnetics Society in Munich earlier this year said the excess was 29% - and that had taken into account the effects of smoking. Mr Hague said that in his constituency he had eight cases of childhood leukaemia, liver cancer and other illnesses near a power line. After meeting Prof Henshaw, he said: \"In respect to construction of new lines, National Grid should look carefully at new evidence before going ahead with more.\" Dr John Swanson, scientific advisor to the National Grid, and advisor on electric and magnetic fields for the Electricity Association said he accepted that Prof Henshaw had shown that power cables affected airborne particles. \"I do not believe he has shown that has a consequence for health.\" \"We have never said in a categorical way that power lines are safe, that simply would not be honest.

      "bodyText": "In what could be Concorde's final flight, an Air France jetliner will cross the Atlantic in lonely supersonic splendour in the next couple of days, arriving in Paris to an emotional welcome from ground staff. \"We've all missed it and we'll be happy to see it back home again,\" said Lucien Guy, a mechanic at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport's QN hangar, where all the French carrier's Concordes have been in storage since the catastrophic crash in July. A team of 12 French technicians has been in New York for a week preparing the return of Concorde F-BVFC, which was stranded at New York's JFK airport after Air France's decision to ground its five remaining supersonic jetliners. France's civil aviation directorate, the DGAC, said yesterday it had given the airline permission to bring the miss ing plane home, exceptionally reinstating Concorde's airworthiness certificate, which was withdrawn by British and French authorities last month. No passengers - not even Air France's chief executive, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, who is reported to have asked to make the trip - will be allowed on the flight, which is scheduled for today or tomorrow and will probably by captained by Edgard Chillaud, Air France's chief Concorde pilot. The airline has had to obtain one-off clearance from all the countries along the Concorde's planned flightpath. \"It's by no means a straightforward flight,\" Mr Guy said. \"When a plane's been out of service for nearly two months, there's a danger of leaking joints in the fuel or hydraulic systems. We've flown out quite a few spare parts already.\" The plane's right-to-fly was withdrawn after French accident investigators said it was likely that a single burst tyre triggered the chain of events that sent the Air France jetliner spiralling in flames into a hotel in the town of Gonesse on July 25, killing 113 people. While aviation experts are working on safety measures that might allow the plane to fly again, and both Air France and British Airways say they are hopeful about its future, many industry observers say the legendary 31-year-old plane's years of commercial service are probably over.",

Writer/director Skip Woods plans a return to the novel's death-at-21 theme (MGM upped the age to 30 to ease casting problems.) \"If they do pull it off, it could be a monster at the box office.\" The year is 2018, and a violent futuristic game called Rollerball is now the world's recreational sport. It's used to control the populace by demonstrating the futility of individuality. \"The classic combination of sport and gladiatorial violence has tremendous appeal. A competent remake has got to do good business with the right star.\" Solyaris, meanwhile, is a seminal piece about psych-ology and alternative realities. But according to Sean, \"The plot could be a bit too cerebral for the modern audience.\" \"Finite nonlinears\", robots closely resembling human beings, get a test run in Test Pilot Pirx. \"Like Solyaris, it's a neat idea for a novelette, but might struggle to hook a contemporary multiplex crowd.\"",

      "body": "<p>Sir Richard Branson has turned the thrust of his Virgin Mobile business across the Atlantic with plans to launch an assault on the US mobile phone market. </p> <p>The company is understood to be holding discussions with US networks AT&amp;T, Voicestream and Sprint in the hope of setting up a joint venture modelled on the existing British business. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile in Britain is a 50/50 split between Virgin and One2One. </p> <p>The negotiations with the US networks are described as being at an advanced stage. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile has opened an office in San Francisco and appointed former McKinsey consultant John Tantum to run the US operation. </p> <p>Since the agreement with One2One was signed last year, Virgin has brokered similar agreements with Singapore Telecom to expand the business throughout South-east Asia and with Cable &amp; Wire less Optus in Australia. Mr Tantum said the company was seeking an equity relationship in the US but declined to comment on individual negotiations. </p> <p>\"We've talked to all the operators in the US and there is a high level of interest,\" he said. \"We are engaged with a number of operators and in some cases in fairly detailed negotiations about what sort of relationship Virgin will have with a network operator.\" </p> <p>The deal with Singapore Telecom saw the Asian busi ness injecting $450m and Virgin contributing a further $50m. </p> <p>\"We are very likely to have an equity relationship with a carrier,\" Mr Tantum added. \"The appealing thing of the 50-50 arrangement to us is that it aligns the incentives. We both have the same interests in making the company successful.\" </p> <p>The US presents a vastly lucrative opportunity with current penetration rates far lower than in most parts of Europe. The development of the industry in the US was hampered by a system whereby the recipient of a call paid the bill and by the failure to agree a standard technology across the country. </p> <p>The lack of a national operator may make it difficult, however, for Virgin to achieve its ambition of becoming a player across the length and breadth of the US. </p> <p>Sir Richard has outlined hopes of developing a global mobile brand and the business has become one of the main focuses of the Virgin empire. He recently sold a stake in his flagship Virgin Atlantic airline to fund investments in mobile phones and the internet. </p> <p>Virgin Mobile UK, which began last November, claims to have signed up 400,000 customers. The company introduced an integrated MP3 mobile phone earlier this month. </p> <p>The Virgin brand name is less well known in the US where its most high profile business is its chain of 20 Megastores - the group's music retailer. Other ventures in cluding Virgin Cola have proved less successful. </p> <p>In the US, the mobile business will target a younger market than the UK, aiming at 15-to 30-year-olds. </p> <p>At home, Sir Richard will discover today whether his bid for the National Lottery will face a renewed challenge from incumbent operator Camelot. A verdict is due in the high court in the judicial review of the National Lottery Commission's decision to negotiate exclusively with Sir Richard's People's Lottery.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has turned the thrust of his Virgin Mobile business across the Atlantic with plans to launch an assault on the US mobile phone market. The company is understood to be holding discussions with US networks AT&amp;T, Voicestream and Sprint in the hope of setting up a joint venture modelled on the existing British business. Virgin Mobile in Britain is a 50/50 split between Virgin and One2One. The negotiations with the US networks are described as being at an advanced stage. Virgin Mobile has opened an office in San Francisco and appointed former McKinsey consultant John Tantum to run the US operation. Since the agreement with One2One was signed last year, Virgin has brokered similar agreements with Singapore Telecom to expand the business throughout South-east Asia and with Cable &amp; Wire less Optus in Australia. Mr Tantum said the company was seeking an equity relationship in the US but declined to comment on individual negotiations. \"We've talked to all the operators in the US and there is a high level of interest,\" he said. \"We are engaged with a number of operators and in some cases in fairly detailed negotiations about what sort of relationship Virgin will have with a network operator.\" The deal with Singapore Telecom saw the Asian busi ness injecting $450m and Virgin contributing a further $50m. \"We are very likely to have an equity relationship with a carrier,\" Mr Tantum added. \"The appealing thing of the 50-50 arrangement to us is that it aligns the incentives. We both have the same interests in making the company successful.\" The US presents a vastly lucrative opportunity with current penetration rates far lower than in most parts of Europe. The development of the industry in the US was hampered by a system whereby the recipient of a call paid the bill and by the failure to agree a standard technology across the country. The lack of a national operator may make it difficult, however, for Virgin to achieve its ambition of becoming a player across the length and breadth of the US. Sir Richard has outlined hopes of developing a global mobile brand and the business has become one of the main focuses of the Virgin empire. He recently sold a stake in his flagship Virgin Atlantic airline to fund investments in mobile phones and the internet. Virgin Mobile UK, which began last November, claims to have signed up 400,000 customers. The company introduced an integrated MP3 mobile phone earlier this month. The Virgin brand name is less well known in the US where its most high profile business is its chain of 20 Megastores - the group's music retailer. Other ventures in cluding Virgin Cola have proved less successful. In the US, the mobile business will target a younger market than the UK, aiming at 15-to 30-year-olds. At home, Sir Richard will discover today whether his bid for the National Lottery will face a renewed challenge from incumbent operator Camelot. A verdict is due in the high court in the judicial review of the National Lottery Commission's decision to negotiate exclusively with Sir Richard's People's Lottery.",

As a priest of the isolationist Bobo Ashanti sect, has this militant Rastaman elected to stay in such dreary surroundings to be as far removed as possible from the modern embodiment of Babylon? No, his UK record label representative scoffs. He is staying here \"to keep him out of trouble\". </p> <p>Trouble has a habit of following Sizzla around. Last year he was due to make a rare foray into Europe to play the Montreux jazz festival, only to be arrested by the Jamaican police for possession of marijuana. This only consolidated his hero status in the eyes of the youth of Sizzla's native northeast Kingston, a disenfranchised constituency who share the authorities' belief that the young man born Miguel Collins is a revolutionary. But the Sizzla legend has extended far beyond the backyard where he spends his days amid clouds of smouldering holy weed. </p> <p>As evinced by a torrent of brilliant records over the past four years, Sizzla has the potential to catapult reggae out of the dancehall ghetto to which it retreated after the death of Bob Marley in 1981.

Which is something Sizzla says a lot. </p> <p>\"Selassie I! Jah! Rastafari!\" he exclaims as the tape recorder is switched on. \"A Rastaman pass through New York to give the word of right unto his children. You know? Yeah. Through any medium which I found possible I could send word afloat to keep them unified until the day of redemption, repatriation. That's what I am doing here, as a Rastaman. Singing few songs for ma nation, because ma nation had wanted me to sing songs for them. See, the psalms are songs. Written by the famous King David, chief musician, so we sing music to keep ourselves together, to rid ourselves of oppression and ignorance. Rastafari.\" </p> <p>The notion of Sizzla ever cashing in on his innate pop-star qualities is swiftly dispelled on meeting him. For him, music is not a career, but the means to disseminate The Truth: that the former Emperor of Ethiopia, Ras Tafari, Haile Selassie (who died in 1975), is God, and that the children of those taken from Africa and sold into slavery in the New World should return to Africa in an act of mass repatriation. There, free from the west's influences, they will lead lives of rural Arcadian bliss. </p> <p>Sizzla professes bewilderment at the concept of fame. \"I'm not aware of being a pop star,\" he says. \"I am aware of being someone who stands up for equal rights and justice and stands up to see the redemption of my people going to Africa. Yes.\" </p> <p>Slightly built, with wire-rimmed spectacles and a soft, lilting voice, he neither looks nor sounds like a revolutionary. Born to Rasta parents some 25 years ago, he has been heard to utter anti-white and homophobic comments at concerts in Jamaica, but today is professing love for all people who love Rastafari. His producer, on the other hand, the ominously proportioned Philip \"Fatis\" Burrell, is a man not to be messed with. Fatis runs Xterminator, one of Jamaica's foremost production houses, and has worked on the bulk of Sizzla's best work, including last year's Royal Son of Ethiopia album. </p> <p>Fatis guards his young charge like a mother goose whose golden egg is ready to hatch but could equally disintegrate any minute. Sizzla himself seems indifferent to anything that resembles a measured release schedule or conventional promotional campaign: this is his first interview in four years, to coincide with his 12th album in that period. The prospect of his music making much of an impact globally is further diminished by his favours being shared between two record labels, both of which have just released a new Sizzla album: Bobo Ashanti on the UK's Greensleeves and Words of Truth on New York's VP. Great news for the diehard fans, but a paragon of marketing non-strategy. </p> <p>Sizzla is oblivious to it all. He's just a prophet, doing God's work, referring everything back to the scriptures and the chief musician, the man he credits with writing the songs in the first instance. \"Everything is in history, what I am saying is nothing new,\" he says. \"It's just that I would have to come and make it brand new in thoughts again to let you know that we are still here and need to go home. No one should feel upset when I speak for my nation, because that's how I stand, and I look on TV and I see how these great presidents speak for the people. So I have to speak for my people also. Blessed. Holy Emmanuel I, Selassie I, Jah, Rastafari.\" </p> <p>Sizzla's first interview for years ends, as it began, in surreal circumstances, with a mild-mannered yellow-turbaned Rastaman blessing a tape recorder.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are two ways into Apocalypse, the much-discussed new exhibition at the Royal Academy. You can either walk in, or you can crawl. Norman Rosenthal, co-curator of this exhibition with Max Wigram, invited me to take the latter route. Concertinaed through a grubby, cramped little hatch on my hands and knees, I found myself in a narrow, dank, rubbish-strewn and dimly lit maze. Unsure which way to go, ducking and bungling my way through, I turned and turned again, following what little light there was. Poking my head into a cement-lined cell, I found myself reflected between greasy mirrors, a head in a grim void. Moving on, crab-wise, I finally wormed my way out. </p> <p>This is not so much a habitation or an art installation as a model of an artist's mind, his ever inward-digging bolt hole. Gregor Schneider's Cellar (1985-99) is a version of the house where he lives in Germany, a house he has altered and goes on altering all the time, constructing within it hidden rooms, false windows, spaces within spaces. It is a series of illusions and traps, a sinister lair. How the artist lives, one can only imagine with reluctance and trepidation. There is apparently a room in Schneider's house whose sound-proofed door can be opened neither from within nor from without, should it slam behind you. </p> <p>There is a way out here, a stumble into the larger space of the darkened gallery that contains Schneider's structure. Did the air-kiss-and-tell socialites at Monday's exclusive Prada party at the Royal Academy snag their rags on the rough concrete, rip their tights and spoil their creases on the dirty floor of Schneider's contribution to the show? Heavens, I do hope so. Did the conversation pall in the room where the Holocaust happens, the table-top world that Jake and Dinos Chapman have spent two years making, corpse by corpse, violation by violation? I have no doubt. Nor that the cognoscenti parked their expensive behinds on the polished wooden slatted seats of Darren Almond's shiny glass-and-aluminium bus shelters, which are eventually to be installed in Auschwitz. Almond's work is expressive because of its normality, its hygiene, its cleanliness, its sense of forgetting. </p> <p>Mike Kelley's installation, on the other hand, is a false memory, a reconstruction of the photo of a play in a high-school yearbook. The original photograph is scary in itself, and Kelley has upped the ante, producing a perfect simulacrum of the set - a dingy room containing a rumpled bed, a stupid sculpture on a plinth, an oven with an open door. He has also produced a play, shown on video, whose two participants, closely modelled on the original photo, act out a dark and funny two-hander. Like Endgame, or Steptoe and Son, or Joseph Losey's 1963 film The Servant, the play acts out two lives trapped in the room. It deserves several viewings. It is mannered, twisted, obscene and hilarious. Suicide, Sylvia Plath, ass-fondling, power games and art are its subjects, all done in an early-sitcom style. </p> <p>Like Jeff Koons's work, and like Richard Prince's paintings with stupid old jokes stencilled on them, Kelley's installation digs into the familiar world of the American banal. Whether Kelley wants to be heir to Edward Albee or David Mamet is another matter. Bleak as hell, made bleaker yet by its hilarity and ponderous cliches, Kelley's work has a lightness that most of the rest of the show tries for but can't quite manage. </p> <p>In Chris Cunningham's new video installation Flex, life and death and sex are given a booming Aphex Twin soundtrack. Bodies are beautiful, against interstellar smoky blackness. It is terribly compelling and exciting, but where does it leave us? Looking at a woman with her mouth mashed in and red with blood from a man's punch. His foreskin peeled back in close-up, prelude to an atavistic fuck. It is as though Cunningham was trying to live up to the show's full title, Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art. </p> <p>Looking at Wolfgang Tillmans's photo of a rose, a rose bleeding red into its white background, I cannot but find it, in the context of Apocalypse, sick, like Blake's rose, like a bloom of blood on a sheet, the tell-tale fleck in the sputum. Tillmans's virulent towering cloudscapes, updating John Martin's eschato- logical 18th-century paintings, are born of aeroplane-window views, stains in the developing tank. In the age of Aids (from which Tillmans's lover died) maybe his work is about grabbing beauty where you can, holding on to moments, seeing beauty or the poignant in the simplest things. The tenderness of his images shines through. </p> <p>As does the malaise in Luc Tuymans's paintings. The reddish-green light, the shapelessness of his rendering of pillows, the bare bulbs dangling in Lamproom, the banality of his image of a folkloric festival, are all some way repulsive. His painting of a cloth embroidered with stilted leaves and flowers, tobacco-stained yellow and hopeless (they have, like Lady Bertram's needlepoint in Mansfield Park, little wit and no beauty) points to the same thing: a sort of disgustedness. They deal, in a certain way, with corruption, in which the bourgeois taste for painting is implicated. There is a deceptive relationship between the image and the manner of its articulation, the work's actual subject and its motif. </p> <p>Maurizio Cattelan's joke sculpture of the Pope, a life-size and realistic sculpture of the pontiff floored by a meteor that appears to have crashed through the glass roof of the gallery, may be found offensive. This act of Cattelan - not God, nor an indifferent universe - is no more troubling, nor funnier, than many of the cartoons one finds in newspapers in Catholic countries. Impeccably staged, it presents a very old kind of apocalyptic vision - of horsemen and fires in the sky, heavenly portents and divine retribution - that we might have thought had disappeared. Yet only this week a Liberal Democrat was promoting a Star Wars offensive against falling rocks and cosmic debris. Plus \u00e7a change - Cattelan's work is a see-once-then-forget-it gag. That so much effort has gone into it renders it monumentally absurd. </p> <p>Tim Noble and Sue Webster's spotlit pile of rubbish bags and detritus casts a shadow image of the artists on the wall - as a prelapsarian couple on a country hillside. Like Mike Leigh's Nuts in May, or Beckett's ever more hopeless peregrinations through bogs and corncrake-inhabited fields, this tableau associates the bucolic with the road to heaven or hell. A road, in this case, paved not with good intentions, but with pure crap. And what are the couple thinking, up there on the hill? I imagine their heads filled with air, or with the endlessly spinning images in Angus Fairhurst's hand-drawn film animation, with its mesmerising cycle of proliferating forms, which wheel, wiggle, multiply and mutate. The forms become overlaid as they turn, ending up with a rotating circle of jumbled black scribble. Being mesmerised can be trance-like and transcendental, which I guess has a kind of beauty in it. Or it can be distressingly repetitive, like an inner voice saying the same thing again and again till you'd chop your own head off to make it stop. Or the whole experience can be merely irritating, and watching Fairhurst becomes a scopophilic version of picking at a scab. His work makes you want to run amok through the galleries, beating other visitors about the head with your Acoustiguide. Time for my medication. </p> <p>The works that - I can only guess - are intended to show a modern idea of beauty are at best horribly pretty. I was too tall to crouch in a praying position in Mariko Mori's high-tech, translucent pagoda, and had to sit with my knees somewhere up about my ears as though I were straining on a potty. Before me, on a curved, womb-like screen, water rose and fell, rain twinkled, jewelly little shapes flickered and swam. This 3-D multimedia experience (you'll have to queue, probably for hours) is all the more tiresome and pathetic for the effort that has gone into it. It bought out the inner child in me, the one that wants to smash things up. </p> <p>Ditto Jeff Koons's paintings of kiddy toys in their world of popcorn, plastic smiles and gaily coloured balloons. This is a heaven made of Mylar. It is impossible to know whether Koons is celebrating childhood's world of grimacing, wide-eyed plastic, or if he is telling us something about the horror of our formative, Toys R Us years. </p> <p> His room comes directly after Hell, the Chapmans' concentration camp diorama, in which mutants run the camp, and the Nazis are the victims. One traces a thread between Koons's infantilism (which makes us realise that children don't inherently like this stuff, but have it imposed on them by adults) and the pre- adolescent grisliness and black humour of the Chapmans' evil world. Hell is a grotesque spectacle of the unconscionable. So too, we must remind ourselves, is Schindler's List. Spielberg's attempt to be sensitive was as meaningless as the Chapmans' impulse to horrify and entertain, which at least has the merit of honesty about our voyeuristic urges. Dealing with the Holocaust as imagery for art, the movies, or literature is inevitably difficult. Hell is saved - if salvation has any meaning here - by the gags, the ludicrousness of it, the impossibility of treating its subject fully and truthfully, without becoming mawkish, mendacious or prurient. The Chapmans' answer is to go too far, which is perhaps not even far enough. </p> <p>In his 1967 book on the apocalypse, The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode observed that it is only the outward signs of apocalypse that have changed with the centuries, and that its threat has always been felt to be imminent. \"It is commonplace to talk about our historical situation as uniquely terrible,\" he wrote, \"but can it really be so? Many of [our predecessors] felt as we do. If the evidence looks good to us, so it did to them. Perhaps if we have a terrible privilege, it is merely that we are alive and are going to die, all at once or one at a time.\" This is either itself a common-place, or it is profound. It only matters if this knowledge helps us live more fully. If this show is anything, it is also either banal or profound. Perhaps it is both, but not always in the way it was intended. </p> <p>Apocalypse is at the Royal Academy, London W1 (020-7300 8000), from Saturday to December 15.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are two ways into Apocalypse, the much-discussed new exhibition at the Royal Academy. You can either walk in, or you can crawl. Norman Rosenthal, co-curator of this exhibition with Max Wigram, invited me to take the latter route. Concertinaed through a grubby, cramped little hatch on my hands and knees, I found myself in a narrow, dank, rubbish-strewn and dimly lit maze. Unsure which way to go, ducking and bungling my way through, I turned and turned again, following what little light there was. Poking my head into a cement-lined cell, I found myself reflected between greasy mirrors, a head in a grim void. Moving on, crab-wise, I finally wormed my way out. This is not so much a habitation or an art installation as a model of an artist's mind, his ever inward-digging bolt hole. Gregor Schneider's Cellar (1985-99) is a version of the house where he lives in Germany, a house he has altered and goes on altering all the time, constructing within it hidden rooms, false windows, spaces within spaces. It is a series of illusions and traps, a sinister lair. How the artist lives, one can only imagine with reluctance and trepidation. There is apparently a room in Schneider's house whose sound-proofed door can be opened neither from within nor from without, should it slam behind you. There is a way out here, a stumble into the larger space of the darkened gallery that contains Schneider's structure. Did the air-kiss-and-tell socialites at Monday's exclusive Prada party at the Royal Academy snag their rags on the rough concrete, rip their tights and spoil their creases on the dirty floor of Schneider's contribution to the show? Heavens, I do hope so. Did the conversation pall in the room where the Holocaust happens, the table-top world that Jake and Dinos Chapman have spent two years making, corpse by corpse, violation by violation? I have no doubt. Nor that the cognoscenti parked their expensive behinds on the polished wooden slatted seats of Darren Almond's shiny glass-and-aluminium bus shelters, which are eventually to be installed in Auschwitz. Almond's work is expressive because of its normality, its hygiene, its cleanliness, its sense of forgetting. Mike Kelley's installation, on the other hand, is a false memory, a reconstruction of the photo of a play in a high-school yearbook. The original photograph is scary in itself, and Kelley has upped the ante, producing a perfect simulacrum of the set - a dingy room containing a rumpled bed, a stupid sculpture on a plinth, an oven with an open door. He has also produced a play, shown on video, whose two participants, closely modelled on the original photo, act out a dark and funny two-hander. Like Endgame, or Steptoe and Son, or Joseph Losey's 1963 film The Servant, the play acts out two lives trapped in the room. It deserves several viewings. It is mannered, twisted, obscene and hilarious. Suicide, Sylvia Plath, ass-fondling, power games and art are its subjects, all done in an early-sitcom style. Like Jeff Koons's work, and like Richard Prince's paintings with stupid old jokes stencilled on them, Kelley's installation digs into the familiar world of the American banal. Whether Kelley wants to be heir to Edward Albee or David Mamet is another matter. Bleak as hell, made bleaker yet by its hilarity and ponderous cliches, Kelley's work has a lightness that most of the rest of the show tries for but can't quite manage. In Chris Cunningham's new video installation Flex, life and death and sex are given a booming Aphex Twin soundtrack. Bodies are beautiful, against interstellar smoky blackness. It is terribly compelling and exciting, but where does it leave us? Looking at a woman with her mouth mashed in and red with blood from a man's punch. His foreskin peeled back in close-up, prelude to an atavistic fuck. It is as though Cunningham was trying to live up to the show's full title, Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art.

      "bodyText": "Police in India were bracing themselves last night for an explosion of gangland violence after Bombay's leading mafia don survived an audacious assassination attempt during a roof-terrace party in Thailand. Chhota Rajan was relaxing at the gathering in Bangkok when six men wearing suits burst in and sprayed the terrace with bullets. Rajan was hit in the arm and the stomach, but appeared to have survived by jumping off the roof of the bungalow and hobbling away with an injured leg. His right-hand man, Rohit d'Souza, died in the hail of gunfire. D'Souza's wife, Sikandi, and their two-year-old daughter were critically injured. Police later recovered pistols and 48 spent bullets. Responsibility for the assassination attempt has been pinned on Chhota Shakeel, a rival Bombay mafia don based in Dubai. The two men - once allies, now bitter enemies - have been trying to kill each other since 1993 when they fell out. Thai police said they had arrested four suspects in connection with the shooting, three Pakistanis and a Thai national. The suspects apparently told police they had been sent from India as part of a 10-strong gang hired to kill Rajan. According to Indian police sources, the gangsters were recruited by Shakeel in Bombay last month before being whisked to Bangkok via Nepal and Pakistan. The plan to kill Rajan was hatched in Karachi, Pakistan's conspiratorial port city, with the arms used in last Friday's hit smuggled to Thailand by boat. Pakistani intelligence agents may also have been involved, the sources added. Rajan's whereabouts was unclear last night , but the most authoritative report suggested that he was being treated in a Bangkok hospital under the false name of Vijay Daman. Earlier rumours suggested that he had chartered a plane and fled back to his base in Malaysia, from where he masterminds his vast criminal empire. Questions were also being asked as to why Rajan's six normally reliable and heavily armed bodyguards appeared to have let him down. Detectives said privately that, after two years of relative underworld calm, they now expected a wave of tit-for-tat killings as the rival Rajan and Shakeel gangs wrestled for control of Bombay's lucrative drug running and extortion rackets. With Rajan recovering from his wounds, the balance of power has tipped decisively in Shakeel's favour, they added. \"We are still working on various leads,\" Bombay's joint commissioner of crime, D Sivanandan, said. \"We are on top of the situation and will keep a tight grip on underworld activity.\" Shakeel's boss, Dawood Ibrahim, almost undoubtedly sanctioned the attempted killing. It was Ibrahim, resident in Dubai since 1984 and India's most infamous don, who gave Rajan his first break by recruiting him as a contract murderer. Seven years ago, however, following anti-Muslim riots, Ibrahim orchestrated a series of bomb blasts against the Hindu community in Bombay by way of revenge. Rajan, a Hindu, walked out of the gang and a plot to have him drowned failed. Since then the feud has prompted at least 200 killings. But until the Bangkok shootout none of its leading protagonists had been hurt. A school dropout who began his criminal career selling black market cinema tickets, Rajan, 41, now heads an empire with a monthly turnover estimated at \u00a3150m. As well as drug running, he is also involved in the shady world of Bollywood film financing, and extorting protection money, or hafta, from local businessmen.

Mauve, a colour with a more dramatic history than any other, doesn't suit everyone and doesn't go with much. When people wear it they look great or awful, with not much in between.

He got the molecule wrong, but found that the oily dark sludge he produced dyed his shirt a brilliant purple.

The other is awaiting deportation. In both cases, the results of the attacks are said to have been used by regional officials in eastern Germany as grounds for getting rid of them.</p> <p>Their cases have been taken up by the speaker of the federal parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, who has claimed they demonstrate covert official backing for the far right.</p> <p>One of the foreigners, an Egyptian, Salah el-Nemr, owned a pizzeria in the town of Elsterwerda, 100 miles south-east of Berlin. After it was burned down by skinheads in October 1998, he was told he had lost his right to stay in Germany because his resident's permit was dependent on his having a viable business.</p> <p>Mr el-Nemr, who lived in Germany for 10 years, left the country voluntarily to avoid getting a deportation stamp in his passport that would have prevented him from returning as a visitor. He told a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Zeitung in Cairo that he hoped to be allowed back in to marry his German fiancee.</p> <p>An Algerian asylum seeker, who has so far been identified only as Khaleb B, lost his right to stay on the grounds that he was no longer mentally fit to manage his life by himself.</p> <p>However, he and his lawyer maintain that this is because of the trauma he underwent in February 1999 when he watched as a friend was lynched in the streets of Guben near the Polish border.</p> <p>He is currently awaiting deportation. The trial of his friend's alleged killers began last week.</p> <p>The political row has erupted against a background of mounting alarm in the federal government over the prevalence of far right and xenophobic sentiment in the formerly communist east. The Brandenburg region around Berlin where both men lived has become notorious for race hate attacks.</p> <p>On July 28, Mr Thierse wrote to the interior minister in the Brandenburg regional government, describing the treatment of the two men as \"devastating\".</p> <p>The speaker, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SDP), said that decisions taken by the regional administration's aliens department \"give the impression that German government agencies not only accept the consequences of rightwing and racist activity, but even use them as an official pretext\".</p> <p>His accusation brought a heated reaction from the authorities in Brandenburg. Earlier this month, the regional interior minister, J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm, a Christian Democrat, replied to Mr Thierse demanding an apology. The head of the Christian Democrat group in the Brandenburg regional assembly accused the speaker of \"abusing his position\".</p> <p>Mr Thierse has taken a keen interest in the issue of neo-Nazi violence and its social underpinnings. He is a frequent visitor to schools in the east.</p> <p>The Brandenburg authorities have claimed that Mr el-Nemr's engagement is a ploy aimed at securing his return. However, when Berliner Zeitung's correspondent traced him in Cairo, he produced an intimate love letter from his fiancee. He was also carrying photographs of the dog and flat he left behind and of his fiancee before and after their separation.</p> <p>One of his friends was quoted as saying: \"Salah changed in Germany. He is serious about his work and always punctual. But what use are these German values if these people are capable of destroying the life of a peaceable, hard-working man from one moment to the next?\"1818</p>",

After it was burned down by skinheads in October 1998, he was told he had lost his right to stay in Germany because his resident's permit was dependent on his having a viable business. Mr el-Nemr, who lived in Germany for 10 years, left the country voluntarily to avoid getting a deportation stamp in his passport that would have prevented him from returning as a visitor. He told a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Zeitung in Cairo that he hoped to be allowed back in to marry his German fiancee. An Algerian asylum seeker, who has so far been identified only as Khaleb B, lost his right to stay on the grounds that he was no longer mentally fit to manage his life by himself. However, he and his lawyer maintain that this is because of the trauma he underwent in February 1999 when he watched as a friend was lynched in the streets of Guben near the Polish border. He is currently awaiting deportation. The trial of his friend's alleged killers began last week. The political row has erupted against a background of mounting alarm in the federal government over the prevalence of far right and xenophobic sentiment in the formerly communist east. The Brandenburg region around Berlin where both men lived has become notorious for race hate attacks. On July 28, Mr Thierse wrote to the interior minister in the Brandenburg regional government, describing the treatment of the two men as \"devastating\". The speaker, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SDP), said that decisions taken by the regional administration's aliens department \"give the impression that German government agencies not only accept the consequences of rightwing and racist activity, but even use them as an official pretext\". His accusation brought a heated reaction from the authorities in Brandenburg. Earlier this month, the regional interior minister, J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm, a Christian Democrat, replied to Mr Thierse demanding an apology. The head of the Christian Democrat group in the Brandenburg regional assembly accused the speaker of \"abusing his position\". Mr Thierse has taken a keen interest in the issue of neo-Nazi violence and its social underpinnings. He is a frequent visitor to schools in the east. The Brandenburg authorities have claimed that Mr el-Nemr's engagement is a ploy aimed at securing his return. However, when Berliner Zeitung's correspondent traced him in Cairo, he produced an intimate love letter from his fiancee. He was also carrying photographs of the dog and flat he left behind and of his fiancee before and after their separation. One of his friends was quoted as saying: \"Salah changed in Germany. He is serious about his work and always punctual. But what use are these German values if these people are capable of destroying the life of a peaceable, hard-working man from one moment to the next?\"1818",

Canary Wharf, a development centred around Britain's tallest building, was originally built up by Olympia &amp; York under the control of Paul Reichmann, Canary Wharf's chairman. But the 1987 property crash put the whole scheme into the hands of a group of rescuing banks. The development on the Isle of Dogs in east London has made a comeback and now challenges the City as a key location for finance and business and Canary Wharf announced yestreday that the John Lewis-owned supermarket group Waitrose had signed a lease for an 80,000sq ft store which would open in two years time. Discussions are also going on with US energy group Enron while a host of other top City names such as international law firm Clifford Chance have taken office space. Deutsche Bank has been considering a move down the river which would follow its rivals such as HSBC and Citigroup who have already gone to Docklands. Competition between the City and Canary Wharf is so intense that it has encouraged the former to consider relaxing planning controls to allow buildings such as the 41-storey \"erotic gherkin\" under consideration by Swiss Re. Canary Wharf shares ended the day up 5.5p at 535.5p with Mr Iacobescu saying there would be no dividend because the money was best reinvested in development. He predicts higher rents as reviews get under way with the whole site occupied by 2003 or 2004.",

Hmm?</p> <p>\u0095 \"Sir - The article published under the name Sin Simon (Sept 18) reinforces my belief that no such person exists. No rational being could write such hysterical nonsense. It must have been derived from a word processor amalgam of Alastair Campbell's ravings.\" Lord Tebbit in the Daily Telegraph yesterday.</p> <p>\u0095 I'm not sure which of these news items is the more bizarre. One is that the Young Fabians annual reception (guest speaker P Mandelson) at Brighton is being sponsored by the Sunday Telegraph. The other (and this may be what our editor wistfully calls a \"scoop\") is that the reception will launch a leaflet by Mr Tony Blair entitled \"The Case for Socialism\". Apparently it fills the back of an entire first class stamp.</p> <p>\u0095 \"Sir -I note with interest that Sin Simon is an anagram for 'On Mission', which can be the only explanation for the intemperate and insulting tripe in his column.\" Another happy Telegraph reader.</p> <p>\u0095 An intriguing offer arrives on a poster for a candidate in a Kent county council byelection. \"Dave Hammock has run a local pub for 20 years,\" it reads. Next to a photo of Mr Hammock is the winning slogan: \"Elect Dave Hammock and you'll get one.\" Now there's a politician taking things head on. So how are you going to \"give one\" to all your electors? \"With 13,000 constituents, that could take me all week,\" jests Dave when we call the Black Horse pub in Bean. But he won't be drawn into a pub landlord rant, even on the \"It's a pint for the fella and a glass of white wine for the lady\" issue.</p> <p>\u0095 \"Sir - Surely Sin Simon can only be the imaginary creation of Peter Simple.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Marking the first anniversary of the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster is a sensitive issue for First Great Western rail franchise. But it has come up with a very British mark of respect by cancelling a rail service - the 6.03am Cheltenham service on October 5. A better mark of respect would be if the company invested in Automatic Train Protection for its entire network to ensure it never happens again.</p> <p>\u0095 Many thanks to all those readers who called to say that the Bill Gates joke in yesterday's Diary (the one with the punchline \"F*** off Gates, can't you see I'm busy!\") is in fact older than the printed word. Frankly I'm shocked, having heard it from a man in a pub who read it on an email. If that's not an impeccable source then I don't know what is.</p> <p>\u0095 Speaking of old gags, hats off to the Express for its campaign to increase pensions, illustrated by a bag of peanuts. \"This year state pensions have risen by 75p, just enough to buy a bag of peanuts,\" it proclaimed yesterday. A striking metaphor - just as striking as when my colleague Nick Timmins and I first coined it on the front-page of the FT on September 15, 1999.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Labour should now close ranks and unite against the real enemy: Peter Mandelson. Ha ha, just kidding Peter. No, the real enemies are still the Tories, and all it takes is a glimpse of Michael Portillo to remind us. Polly popped up yesterday on GMTV (well known for its Spanish Inquisition interviewing style). \"Sometimes [politicians] try to avoid issues, but if we are asked something head-on you have really got to answer it,\" Polly said. An excellent attitude, and as it happens Michael there are one or two questions you could answer. Such as, how much exactly do you get paid by the Kerr McGee oil and multinational, and for what? And how did the Tory party tally donations from Michael Ashcroft's Belize trust with its ban on foreign donations? Hmm? \u0095 \"Sir - The article published under the name Sin Simon (Sept 18) reinforces my belief that no such person exists. No rational being could write such hysterical nonsense. It must have been derived from a word processor amalgam of Alastair Campbell's ravings.\" Lord Tebbit in the Daily Telegraph yesterday. \u0095 I'm not sure which of these news items is the more bizarre. One is that the Young Fabians annual reception (guest speaker P Mandelson) at Brighton is being sponsored by the Sunday Telegraph. The other (and this may be what our editor wistfully calls a \"scoop\") is that the reception will launch a leaflet by Mr Tony Blair entitled \"The Case for Socialism\". Apparently it fills the back of an entire first class stamp. \u0095 \"Sir -I note with interest that Sin Simon is an anagram for 'On Mission', which can be the only explanation for the intemperate and insulting tripe in his column.\" Another happy Telegraph reader. \u0095 An intriguing offer arrives on a poster for a candidate in a Kent county council byelection. \"Dave Hammock has run a local pub for 20 years,\" it reads. Next to a photo of Mr Hammock is the winning slogan: \"Elect Dave Hammock and you'll get one.\" Now there's a politician taking things head on. So how are you going to \"give one\" to all your electors? \"With 13,000 constituents, that could take me all week,\" jests Dave when we call the Black Horse pub in Bean. But he won't be drawn into a pub landlord rant, even on the \"It's a pint for the fella and a glass of white wine for the lady\" issue. \u0095 \"Sir - Surely Sin Simon can only be the imaginary creation of Peter Simple.\" \u0095 Marking the first anniversary of the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster is a sensitive issue for First Great Western rail franchise. But it has come up with a very British mark of respect by cancelling a rail service - the 6.03am Cheltenham service on October 5. A better mark of respect would be if the company invested in Automatic Train Protection for its entire network to ensure it never happens again. \u0095 Many thanks to all those readers who called to say that the Bill Gates joke in yesterday's Diary (the one with the punchline \"F*** off Gates, can't you see I'm busy!\") is in fact older than the printed word. Frankly I'm shocked, having heard it from a man in a pub who read it on an email. If that's not an impeccable source then I don't know what is. \u0095 Speaking of old gags, hats off to the Express for its campaign to increase pensions, illustrated by a bag of peanuts. \"This year state pensions have risen by 75p, just enough to buy a bag of peanuts,\" it proclaimed yesterday. A striking metaphor - just as striking as when my colleague Nick Timmins and I first coined it on the front-page of the FT on September 15, 1999. diary@theguardian.com",

Mrs Justice Hogg, a family division judge, said she was \"gravely concerned\" about the safety of Joe Lillington, nine, and his brother Louis, eight. The boys had been living with their aunt in Bow, east London, since being taken into police protection after their mother, Toni Lillington, 30, a heroin addict, attempted suicide in July last year. The children were taken on August 29.They were seen being put in a yellow Ford Fiesta by a man and a youth. The aunt, Helen Goody, 49, and her twin brother, John, the boys' father, told the judge of their fears that the brothers might be back with their mother; their alternative fear was that the two might have been abducted by paedophiles. Mrs Justice Hogg lifted reporting restrictions and said : \"I have grave concern for these children.\" Press Association",

As reported, it conflates survey respondents' likelihood to protest with their propensity to admit, claim or recognise in themselves a likelihood to protest. It assumes that respondents' differentiation of degrees of satisfaction with democracy are meaningful: one respondent's \"fairly satisfied\" might express the same underlying opinion as another's \"not very satisfied\".</p> <p>It treats protest as an undifferentiated category and then offers a generalised explanation of it in terms of relative deprivation. But some kinds of protest (hunt sabotage, anti-nuclear) are clearly better explained by commitment to principle than by economic relativities. Political protest, like most other social phenomena, cannot be understood through the rather mechanistic method of the large-scale survey.</p> <p><b>Dr Christopher Grey </b><br> University of Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095I take exception to Paul Whiteley assuming that protest arises from a threat to \"income and status\". Further analysis is required where protesters believe in a cause, such as Greenham Common, where political action resulted in loss of those things.

      "bodyText": "\u0095Paul Whiteley's analysis of political protest (Rich picketings, September 19) illustrates the limitations of much of what currently passes, and is funded, as social science research. As reported, it conflates survey respondents' likelihood to protest with their propensity to admit, claim or recognise in themselves a likelihood to protest. It assumes that respondents' differentiation of degrees of satisfaction with democracy are meaningful: one respondent's \"fairly satisfied\" might express the same underlying opinion as another's \"not very satisfied\". It treats protest as an undifferentiated category and then offers a generalised explanation of it in terms of relative deprivation. But some kinds of protest (hunt sabotage, anti-nuclear) are clearly better explained by commitment to principle than by economic relativities. Political protest, like most other social phenomena, cannot be understood through the rather mechanistic method of the large-scale survey. Dr Christopher Grey University of Cambridge \u0095I take exception to Paul Whiteley assuming that protest arises from a threat to \"income and status\". Further analysis is required where protesters believe in a cause, such as Greenham Common, where political action resulted in loss of those things. Big Oil and \"fat blokes\" only represent their own interests. A more reasoned debate on the nature of democracy would have to include altruism.

A place where \"resting actors\" touting all manner of hi-tech devices explain how, in a few years time, we will be able to use mobile phones to program the temperature of our bath water. </p> <p>It is all tremendous fun and sure to fire the imagination of those who see it. But is this really what awaits the nation's semis? The organisers of Live 2000, opening at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London today, certainly believe so. They have developed a Smart Home to show how products can talk to each other intelligently and be programmed via the internet or by a mobile phone. </p> <p>Live's visitors can explore four rooms bristling with screens, keypads and gadgets. And, as all the electrical devices are linked, users can control them via a keypad, or remotely using a mobile phone. Among the hi-tech conjuring tricks the system will perform is the ability to operate curtains, blinds and lighting. There is also the option of switching the oven on remotely, or the chance for family members to play PC games against each other while in different rooms. </p> <p>But while tomorrow's smart homes will control everything from your PC to your toaster via an advanced \"webpad\" remote control (or, eventually, a third generation mobile phone), today things are rather different. </p> <p>Most of the devices in your home can't even talk to each other yet, let alone respond to the instructions of our keypad toting cyber-dad. </p> <p>So for the concept of the smart home to develop, household items must first learn to talk to each other and operate together, preferably using IP (internet protocol). </p> <p>Until a few years ago all that household electrical items had in common was a mains plug. More recently both consumer electronics and PC manufacturers have woken up to the fact that communication between household devices would simplify consumers' lives. </p> <p>The first inter-device communication standards have begun to appear. Until now they have nearly always been \"wired\" and usually limited to other products of a similar type. For example, printers, digital cameras and computers typically communicate via USB (universal serial bus) cables, while audio visual equipment relies increasingly on the latest IEEE1394 technology, which Sony and its licencees call iLink and Apple, the original developer, calls FireWire. </p> <p>In some quarters, iLink has been touted as the key to home automation. In some ways it has been extremely successful having been incorporated into 50 million VCRs, camcorders, audio systems and even PCs to enable high-speed operations between various devices. </p> <p>Among its champions is Eddie Odjik, Philips' consumer electronics vice president of system architectures. He says: \"iLink is the only technology around today that allows jitterless video connectivity between devices. It already offers 100Mbps data transfer, fast enough for around 20 MPEG2 digital video streams.\" </p> <p>The format's one weakness is that it doesn't yet support multi-room operation. The current iLink standard works only over distances up to 4.5m (14.6ft) - which is nowhere near enough if, for example, you want to run a lead between the lounge and the bedroom. </p> <p>An enhanced iLink specification, capable of operating over distances of up to 100m, will be available, but possibly not until 2002. By then it may have been overtaken, certainly in the home automation field, by wireless technologies. </p> <p>In fact, most industry commentators seem to agree that wireless connection is the way forward (who wants to spend hours installing wires around the home?). But which system? Several formats are battling it out for a slice of what is becoming an increasingly lucrative market. </p> <p>Emerging as front runners are two wireless RF (radio frequency) standards, Wireless LAN - versions of the high-speed Ethernet local area network, also known as IEEE802.11) -and the slower, more imaginatively named Bluetooth technology. </p> <p>In the US, many Apple iMacs and PCs are now shipped with wireless LAN technology for connecting them together and to broadband internet services. </p> <p>Visitors to Live will see a prototype version of Sony's Bluetooth VAIO computer and a Bluetooth mobile phone and headset from Ericsson, both scheduled for release in 2001. From this month, Toshiba in the US will also start selling a Bluetooth card for its notebook PCs capable of communicating with Bluetooth devices once they are launched in 2001. </p> <p>Initially, both wireless formats will be targeted at computer users seeking a more robust alternative to infrared connection for transferring data to and from their notebook computers/PDAs and desktop PCs. </p> <p>For example, a person working on a laptop in the living room could print out a document on a printer in the upstairs study. </p> <p>However, this represents only a small part of what wireless will be able to offer. Boasting a range of 10m, which can be extended to 100m, Bluetooth is expected to herald the home network revolution in the UK, enabling the connection any IP-enabled device - whether a fridge or a VCR - to a central PC or home server. Combine this with a Wap or third generation UMTS (universal mobile telephone system) mobile phone and it will even be possible to control Bluetooth-enabled devices from outside the home. </p> <p>Using an internet compatible mobile phone, for example, you will one day be able to program the VCR remotely. You could even develop a series of macros to announce your arrival home.

      "bodyText": "No self-respecting consumer electronics exhibition is complete without a home of the future. A place where \"resting actors\" touting all manner of hi-tech devices explain how, in a few years time, we will be able to use mobile phones to program the temperature of our bath water. It is all tremendous fun and sure to fire the imagination of those who see it. But is this really what awaits the nation's semis? The organisers of Live 2000, opening at the Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London today, certainly believe so. They have developed a Smart Home to show how products can talk to each other intelligently and be programmed via the internet or by a mobile phone. Live's visitors can explore four rooms bristling with screens, keypads and gadgets. And, as all the electrical devices are linked, users can control them via a keypad, or remotely using a mobile phone. Among the hi-tech conjuring tricks the system will perform is the ability to operate curtains, blinds and lighting. There is also the option of switching the oven on remotely, or the chance for family members to play PC games against each other while in different rooms. But while tomorrow's smart homes will control everything from your PC to your toaster via an advanced \"webpad\" remote control (or, eventually, a third generation mobile phone), today things are rather different. Most of the devices in your home can't even talk to each other yet, let alone respond to the instructions of our keypad toting cyber-dad. So for the concept of the smart home to develop, household items must first learn to talk to each other and operate together, preferably using IP (internet protocol). Until a few years ago all that household electrical items had in common was a mains plug. More recently both consumer electronics and PC manufacturers have woken up to the fact that communication between household devices would simplify consumers' lives. The first inter-device communication standards have begun to appear. Until now they have nearly always been \"wired\" and usually limited to other products of a similar type. For example, printers, digital cameras and computers typically communicate via USB (universal serial bus) cables, while audio visual equipment relies increasingly on the latest IEEE1394 technology, which Sony and its licencees call iLink and Apple, the original developer, calls FireWire. In some quarters, iLink has been touted as the key to home automation. In some ways it has been extremely successful having been incorporated into 50 million VCRs, camcorders, audio systems and even PCs to enable high-speed operations between various devices. Among its champions is Eddie Odjik, Philips' consumer electronics vice president of system architectures. He says: \"iLink is the only technology around today that allows jitterless video connectivity between devices. It already offers 100Mbps data transfer, fast enough for around 20 MPEG2 digital video streams.\" The format's one weakness is that it doesn't yet support multi-room operation. The current iLink standard works only over distances up to 4.5m (14.6ft) - which is nowhere near enough if, for example, you want to run a lead between the lounge and the bedroom. An enhanced iLink specification, capable of operating over distances of up to 100m, will be available, but possibly not until 2002. By then it may have been overtaken, certainly in the home automation field, by wireless technologies. In fact, most industry commentators seem to agree that wireless connection is the way forward (who wants to spend hours installing wires around the home?). But which system? Several formats are battling it out for a slice of what is becoming an increasingly lucrative market. Emerging as front runners are two wireless RF (radio frequency) standards, Wireless LAN - versions of the high-speed Ethernet local area network, also known as IEEE802.11) -and the slower, more imaginatively named Bluetooth technology. In the US, many Apple iMacs and PCs are now shipped with wireless LAN technology for connecting them together and to broadband internet services. Visitors to Live will see a prototype version of Sony's Bluetooth VAIO computer and a Bluetooth mobile phone and headset from Ericsson, both scheduled for release in 2001. From this month, Toshiba in the US will also start selling a Bluetooth card for its notebook PCs capable of communicating with Bluetooth devices once they are launched in 2001. Initially, both wireless formats will be targeted at computer users seeking a more robust alternative to infrared connection for transferring data to and from their notebook computers/PDAs and desktop PCs. For example, a person working on a laptop in the living room could print out a document on a printer in the upstairs study. However, this represents only a small part of what wireless will be able to offer. Boasting a range of 10m, which can be extended to 100m, Bluetooth is expected to herald the home network revolution in the UK, enabling the connection any IP-enabled device - whether a fridge or a VCR - to a central PC or home server. Combine this with a Wap or third generation UMTS (universal mobile telephone system) mobile phone and it will even be possible to control Bluetooth-enabled devices from outside the home. Using an internet compatible mobile phone, for example, you will one day be able to program the VCR remotely. You could even develop a series of macros to announce your arrival home. So with one flick of a switch the house lights and heating will be turned on, the kettle set to boil, your robot dog will hit over-excitement mode, and the hi-fi system will launch into a suitably regal fanfare.

The founders finally gave in to DCI's advances in May for \u00a333m. </p> <p>\"We never got to the VC part,\" recalls Helga St Blaize, co-founder of Ace-Quote. \"But we certainly saw how difficult it was going to be to get funding. We knew dot.coms would have to start behaving in a grown-up fashion.\" This desire to be seen to be grown-up has prompted others to consider a trade sale, an option sought by both private and already floated companies, particularly the rapidly consolidating European internet service provider sector. </p> <p>Enter World Online. The Dutch ISP that floated on the exchange steeped in ignominy in March, saw its shares dive from their initial \u20ac 43 to as little as \u20ac 10 in May, after it emerged that founder Nina Brink had sold a substantial part of her stake before the IPO. Now the loss-making ISP is considering an offer from Italian giant Tiscali. </p> <p>Gerry Montanus, senior partner at Atlas Ventures, sees both offensive and defensive trade sales as a growing consideration over the coming year. \"It is more of a challenge now than in the past, to get private funding.

The founders finally gave in to DCI's advances in May for \u00a333m. \"We never got to the VC part,\" recalls Helga St Blaize, co-founder of Ace-Quote. \"But we certainly saw how difficult it was going to be to get funding. We knew dot.coms would have to start behaving in a grown-up fashion.\" This desire to be seen to be grown-up has prompted others to consider a trade sale, an option sought by both private and already floated companies, particularly the rapidly consolidating European internet service provider sector. Enter World Online. The Dutch ISP that floated on the exchange steeped in ignominy in March, saw its shares dive from their initial \u20ac 43 to as little as \u20ac 10 in May, after it emerged that founder Nina Brink had sold a substantial part of her stake before the IPO. Now the loss-making ISP is considering an offer from Italian giant Tiscali. Gerry Montanus, senior partner at Atlas Ventures, sees both offensive and defensive trade sales as a growing consideration over the coming year. \"It is more of a challenge now than in the past, to get private funding. For listed companies with high market capitalisation, it will be advantageous to them to pick up companies operating in areas they want to access.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong> Crusoe ahoy</strong><br> Sony could be the first notebook PC supplier to launch a system powered by Transmeta's new Crusoe processor, instead of an Intel or AMD chip. But when Sony showed off a wide range of forthcoming products at its annual European sales conference, held in Venice last week, the PCG-C1VE was overshadowed by other devices. These included the Clie palmtop (What's New, September 7), a new Cybershot digital camera, and the feature-packed J5 mobile phone. </p> <p>The C1VE notebook is small: it has much the same casing as the PCG-1, and the same swivelling Motion Eye camera built in to the lid. And with its 600MHz Crusoe chip, 128 megabytes of memory and 12GB hard drive, the C1VE packs a lot of power into a 1kg package. However, the Crusoe chip's compatibility remains to be proven, and Sony was claiming a only 2.5 hour battery life for its notebook. This is a lot less than the 10-12 hours we expected from the Crusoe's power-saving design. </p> <p>With an estimated price of \u00a31,499 plus VAT when it appears around the end of October, the C1VE may find it hard to win sales. </p> <p>The reverse could well be true with the new PCG-SR11K notebook PC, which is not quite as small but looks more stylish. The SR11K has a 600MHz Intel Pentium III SpeedStep chip instead of the Crusoe, a 10.4in instead of a 9in screen, and Microsoft Windows 2000 instead of Windows Me. It also comes with an external CD-rom drive that costs extra on the C1VE, and while it is a little shorter on memory and hard disk space (64MB, 10GB), it still only weighs 1.36kg. </p> <p>The CMD-J5 mobile phone is like the Z5 launched in June but offers even more features. For example, it lets you record your own ring, so you could use your dog's bark or your better half's titter. It has Tegic's predictive T9 software for fast text entry, and the SMS capability has been extended so you can send images and sounds to other J5 owners, as well as text messages. Like the Z5, the J5 includes Microsoft's Microbrowser, so it can handle HTML as well as Wap pages. </p> <p>Sony had to admit that the J5 could not talk to its Palm-compatible Clie electronic organiser, but said that when the Clie appears in the UK next year, it will. </p> <p>Both new notebook PCs, the Clie, and the J5 phone have slots for Sony Memory Sticks. All four also have Jog Dials, Sony's circular menuing system. </p> <p>The new DSC-P1 camera uses Memory Sticks too, and Sony claims this has helped it make this Cybershot model noticeably small for a 3.34 megapixel camera. The design is unusual because the 3x zoom lens is right at the end of the body, but the whole thing is only 113mm long. The P1 Cybershot can be used to produce images from 640 by 480 pixels (VGA resolution) up to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, and it can also record short MPEG movies. </p> <p>Sony also showed many other new products: video cameras, a projector, an electronic photo printer, a Digital8 Video Walkman, more notebook PCs and even some desktop PCs. (The desktops are already on sale in the US and Japan, and will eventually reach the UK.) And if the stream of new gadgets grew tiring after a while, we could at least be grateful for the absence of new audio and hi-fi systems, video recorders, TV sets, television set-top boxes and other Sony devices from the Aibo robotic dog to PlayStation 2 games console. </p> <p>At least it makes sense of Sony's design strategy. It has to make all its gizmos as small as possible so that customers still have room to buy more. </p> <p> <strong> Born in the UK</strong> </p> <p> Most British people are not descended from Americans, but no one would know this from the American genealogy software sold in the UK. However, Sierra Home - an American subsidiary of France's Havas Interactive - has finally done something about it. It is releasing its Generations software in two localised editions. Generations Starter Kit 8.0 UK Version provides everything most people need, and comes on 11 CDs. Generations Grande Suite 8.0 UK Version includes a lot more data on 20 CDs. It is the one to get if you really need the Magna Charta Sureties, Griffith's Valuation, and various historical records such as the UK Deeds Index Database, the US Civil War Muster Rolls, and the Titanic passenger list. The Starter version goes on sale tomorrow for Microsoft Windows 95/98. </p> <p><strong> Sounds safe </strong><br> Smart cards would be more secure if they could only be used to the sound of their master's voice. Domain Dynamics, based near Swindon, has now shown that this is possible by developing voice authentication soft ware small enough to fit on to an 8KB smart card. The system uses Domain Dynamics' Tespar (time encoded signal processing and recognition) technology to store a template of the card owner's voice. The user provides a speech sample, which is then processed and checked against the template stored on the card. Ian Taylor, a director of the company, says mobile commerce is an obvious application but can \"foresee a range of applications from access control for confidential data to payments made via TV set-top box or PC\". Domain Dynamics is now looking for companies to license the technology for various devices. See <a href=\"http://www.ddl.ision.co.uk\">www.ddl.ision.co.uk</a> </p>",

Sony had to admit that the J5 could not talk to its Palm-compatible Clie electronic organiser, but said that when the Clie appears in the UK next year, it will. Both new notebook PCs, the Clie, and the J5 phone have slots for Sony Memory Sticks. All four also have Jog Dials, Sony's circular menuing system. The new DSC-P1 camera uses Memory Sticks too, and Sony claims this has helped it make this Cybershot model noticeably small for a 3.34 megapixel camera. The design is unusual because the 3x zoom lens is right at the end of the body, but the whole thing is only 113mm long. The P1 Cybershot can be used to produce images from 640 by 480 pixels (VGA resolution) up to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, and it can also record short MPEG movies. Sony also showed many other new products: video cameras, a projector, an electronic photo printer, a Digital8 Video Walkman, more notebook PCs and even some desktop PCs. (The desktops are already on sale in the US and Japan, and will eventually reach the UK.) And if the stream of new gadgets grew tiring after a while, we could at least be grateful for the absence of new audio and hi-fi systems, video recorders, TV sets, television set-top boxes and other Sony devices from the Aibo robotic dog to PlayStation 2 games console. At least it makes sense of Sony's design strategy. It has to make all its gizmos as small as possible so that customers still have room to buy more. Born in the UK Most British people are not descended from Americans, but no one would know this from the American genealogy software sold in the UK. However, Sierra Home - an American subsidiary of France's Havas Interactive - has finally done something about it. It is releasing its Generations software in two localised editions. Generations Starter Kit 8.0 UK Version provides everything most people need, and comes on 11 CDs. Generations Grande Suite 8.0 UK Version includes a lot more data on 20 CDs. It is the one to get if you really need the Magna Charta Sureties, Griffith's Valuation, and various historical records such as the UK Deeds Index Database, the US Civil War Muster Rolls, and the Titanic passenger list. The Starter version goes on sale tomorrow for Microsoft Windows 95/98. Sounds safe Smart cards would be more secure if they could only be used to the sound of their master's voice. Domain Dynamics, based near Swindon, has now shown that this is possible by developing voice authentication soft ware small enough to fit on to an 8KB smart card. The system uses Domain Dynamics' Tespar (time encoded signal processing and recognition) technology to store a template of the card owner's voice. The user provides a speech sample, which is then processed and checked against the template stored on the card. Ian Taylor, a director of the company, says mobile commerce is an obvious application but can \"foresee a range of applications from access control for confidential data to payments made via TV set-top box or PC\". Domain Dynamics is now looking for companies to license the technology for various devices. See www.ddl.ision.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Winter in the Antarctic , the coldest and windiest place on earth. Millions of kilometres of sea remain frozen all year, but as temperatures plummet, up to 20 million square kilometres of ocean - an area twice the size of the USA - are covered with a white layer of ice. </p> <p>The ice may appear barren, but a closer look reveals a multitude of microbial life. Small as they are, these microbes exert an influence over the whole Southern Ocean, and may control the destiny of penguins and seals thousands of miles away. The loss of their habitat, the ice, through global warming, could have devastating consequences. </p> <p>To understand this story, stop looking at things from a warm-blooded human perspective - we wouldn't last long in that cold - and think small. For the microbes that get trapped in the ice, it's not a bad place to be. </p> <p>Temperatures on the ice surface can reach -30C, but on the underside it is a relatively hospitable -1.8C, free from wind and currents. The microbes of this region can function well at freezing temperatures, often as actively as organisms in far warmer waters. </p> <p>\"Ice algae\" were formally described more than 150 years ago. Any passenger on an ice- breaking ship would notice the brown and green layers on the underside of ice that had broken up.But these organisms were not thought to be an important part of the ecology of Polar seas, and attention focused on the algal blooms in the open ocean. </p> <p>As the sea begins to freeze, algae become attached to the growing ice crystals and get concentrated as the ice forms. The majority of the algae live in channels of brine formed when salt gets squeezed out as the water freezes, giving rise to salt concentrations five times higher than seawater. </p> <p>Only a tiny fraction of the light hitting the surface of the ice reaches the bottom, where the majority of the algae live, so the organisms must be well adapted to high salt concentrations and low light. </p> <p>The ice is home to a diverse and complex ecosystem, composed of more than 200 species of algae, as well as a massive diversity of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and higher organisms such as amphipods and even flatworms. It is a mini-ecosystem in a frozen sponge. </p> <p>Algae are microscopic plants that use the sun's light to harvest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When spring approaches, the algal population explodes on a diet of sunlight and minerals from the sea. British Antarctic Survey biologist Simon Brockington says: \"Diving in the middle of winter, the new ice is pristine white. Later in the year it can be like looking up at a field of grass.\" </p> <p>The area of the southern sea-ice far exceeds that of the Antarctic continent, covering an area up to two and a half times the size of Australia. That's a very large meadow. </p> <p>As the algae bloom, they suck in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide which they convert into carbon. This is an important process in the global carbon cycle, and scientists estimate that the ice algae account for 5% of the total amount of carbon trapped through photosynthesis in this region. </p> <p>Algae are the fuel for the entire southern ocean ecosystem because, like grass, they are grazed by bigger creatures. They sustain the most important Antarctic marine food resource, the small shrimplike krill. Krill can graze the underside of the ice at an amazing rate, clearing a 20cm square in five minutes, says Peter Marshall at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Marine Research. Krill are the main meal for many predators such as penguins, seals and whales. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, prior to comprehensive research into the sea-ice, it was assumed that krill were fed by the summer algal bloom in the open water, then hibernated on the sea floor in winter. However, scuba divers under the winter sea-ice off the Antarctic Peninsula saw krill nibbling the ice-algae which were still present in the ice. </p> <p>Two thousands of miles north east of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the island of South Georgia, British Antarctic Survey scientists were studying creatures at the opposite end of the food chain, penguins and fur seals. Three or four times a decade they observed terrible years for breeding, with few pups or chicks surviving. Feeding studies showed that the lean years for these creatures were also lean years for the krill, with no juvenile krill in the water. Krill are not only important for wildlife, but for commercial fisheries too.

      "bodyText": "Winter in the Antarctic , the coldest and windiest place on earth. Millions of kilometres of sea remain frozen all year, but as temperatures plummet, up to 20 million square kilometres of ocean - an area twice the size of the USA - are covered with a white layer of ice. The ice may appear barren, but a closer look reveals a multitude of microbial life. Small as they are, these microbes exert an influence over the whole Southern Ocean, and may control the destiny of penguins and seals thousands of miles away. The loss of their habitat, the ice, through global warming, could have devastating consequences. To understand this story, stop looking at things from a warm-blooded human perspective - we wouldn't last long in that cold - and think small. For the microbes that get trapped in the ice, it's not a bad place to be. Temperatures on the ice surface can reach -30C, but on the underside it is a relatively hospitable -1.8C, free from wind and currents. The microbes of this region can function well at freezing temperatures, often as actively as organisms in far warmer waters. \"Ice algae\" were formally described more than 150 years ago. Any passenger on an ice- breaking ship would notice the brown and green layers on the underside of ice that had broken up.But these organisms were not thought to be an important part of the ecology of Polar seas, and attention focused on the algal blooms in the open ocean. As the sea begins to freeze, algae become attached to the growing ice crystals and get concentrated as the ice forms. The majority of the algae live in channels of brine formed when salt gets squeezed out as the water freezes, giving rise to salt concentrations five times higher than seawater. Only a tiny fraction of the light hitting the surface of the ice reaches the bottom, where the majority of the algae live, so the organisms must be well adapted to high salt concentrations and low light. The ice is home to a diverse and complex ecosystem, composed of more than 200 species of algae, as well as a massive diversity of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and higher organisms such as amphipods and even flatworms. It is a mini-ecosystem in a frozen sponge. Algae are microscopic plants that use the sun's light to harvest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When spring approaches, the algal population explodes on a diet of sunlight and minerals from the sea. British Antarctic Survey biologist Simon Brockington says: \"Diving in the middle of winter, the new ice is pristine white. Later in the year it can be like looking up at a field of grass.\" The area of the southern sea-ice far exceeds that of the Antarctic continent, covering an area up to two and a half times the size of Australia. That's a very large meadow. As the algae bloom, they suck in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide which they convert into carbon. This is an important process in the global carbon cycle, and scientists estimate that the ice algae account for 5% of the total amount of carbon trapped through photosynthesis in this region. Algae are the fuel for the entire southern ocean ecosystem because, like grass, they are grazed by bigger creatures. They sustain the most important Antarctic marine food resource, the small shrimplike krill. Krill can graze the underside of the ice at an amazing rate, clearing a 20cm square in five minutes, says Peter Marshall at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Marine Research. Krill are the main meal for many predators such as penguins, seals and whales. Twenty years ago, prior to comprehensive research into the sea-ice, it was assumed that krill were fed by the summer algal bloom in the open water, then hibernated on the sea floor in winter. However, scuba divers under the winter sea-ice off the Antarctic Peninsula saw krill nibbling the ice-algae which were still present in the ice. Two thousands of miles north east of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the island of South Georgia, British Antarctic Survey scientists were studying creatures at the opposite end of the food chain, penguins and fur seals. Three or four times a decade they observed terrible years for breeding, with few pups or chicks surviving. Feeding studies showed that the lean years for these creatures were also lean years for the krill, with no juvenile krill in the water. Krill are not only important for wildlife, but for commercial fisheries too. So it was vital to find out what was causing these slumps. For answers, scientists looked to the Antarctic Peninsula, a major breeding ground for krill and the possible source of the South Georgia krill. A strong relationship was observed between the extent of sea-ice and the krill numbers. In years when the climate reduced the ice cover near the Antarctic Peninsula, krill production slumped. So the icy pastures of the ice-algae may be having a huge impact on the ecology of the whole Southern Ocean. Biologist Robin Ross of the Marine Science Institute, University of California, thinks that without the winter pasture krill \"wouldn't be able to live through winter\". If normal climatic conditions were having such a profound impact on Southern Ocean ecology through sea-ice formation, what havoc could global warming cause? Warmer temperatures can mean thinner sea-ice, which, says biologist William Ambrose of Bates College USA, \"is likely to promote lux uriant growth of algae\", based on observations from thin sea-ice years in the Arctic. Ironically more algae mean less ice. Being dark, ice-algae absorb heat from the sun more than the ice that surrounds them, speeding up melting and pitting the ice with a honeycomb of large pores. But if atmospheric warming reduces the area of sea-ice, the future could be bleak for penguins, seals and the fishing industry. \"If global warming caused low ice extent for three out of four years\" says Ross, \"there could be a serious problem for krill survival.\" \u0095 Dr Alison George is a microbiologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge .",
