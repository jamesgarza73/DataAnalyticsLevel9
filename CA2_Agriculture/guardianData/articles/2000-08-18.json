In Tenderness, he charted a promiscuous young girl's fixation with a serial killer; The Bumblebee Flies Anyway, set among the terminally ill teenage inmates of an experimental medical institution, was an extraordinary study of tiny moments of hope amid black despair; while his psychological thrillers, such as We All Fall Down and I Am Cheese, don't for a moment shirk the cruelties that humans inflict upon each other.</p> <p>So Frenchtown Summer, an elegiac account of a young paperboy's journey to self-awareness as he walks the streets of his hometown more than 50 years ago, is something of a surprise. Not least because it is written in the form of a prose poem, and because the writing swells with tenderness.</p> <p>Not, of course, that Cormier neglects to tell it how it really is. There are bullies on the street corner, and the mysteries of incipient adulthood meld into darker mysteries that lurk behind the town's sunlit streets. As Cormier's editor noted, the book might be hauntingly beautiful, but Cormier still managed to get a dead body into it.</p> <p>That is because there really was one. Frenchtown Summer is set in the same small American town that features in almost all of Cormier's work, the one where he grew up and has lived almost all his life. And as a child, he was haunted by an unsolved murder that had taken place long before he was born.</p> <p>Cormier still lives just three miles from the house where he was born. For 30 years he worked as a journalist on the local paper, covering everything from the police news to the births, deaths and weddings.</p> <p>All this has fed into his novels, which create a fascinating portrait of suburban American life seen through the eyes of children. There is a wonderful chapter in The Chocolate War when Jerry's doubts about his father, and his fear of growing up to become his father, are represented by that most homely of American suppers - the tuna casserole.</p> <p>Even The Chocolate War was inspired by a real-life incident: back in the early 1970s, Cormier's then teenage son refused to take part in the annual school fund-raising sale as a matter of principle. The worst Cormier's son endured was some joshing and bad-mouthing, but in The Chocolate War it is magnified into an almost life-and-death struggle, as Jerry's refusal to sell 50 boxes of chocolates for the school pits him against the corruption of both his teachers and the school's home-grown student Mafia.</p> <p>Cormier was surprised when his agent informed him that he had written a book for teenagers. \"I wrote the book entirely innocent that there were such things as young adult novels. I thought I was just writing a novel,\" he says. The subject matter, the number of characters and the lack of an optimistic ending made publishers nervous: there were seven rejections before the book was finally accepted.</p> <p>A glowing front-page review in the literary section of the New York Times gave the book the status of an instant children's classic, although like almost all of Cormier's books, it has been subject to frequent campaigns by those who believe it is unsuitable for young people.</p> <p>\"I am so weary of it,\" says Cormier. \"I never come to the defence of one of my books. But if a teacher or librarian is under threat then I feel that I must, and I do. The problem is that so often the people who want to censor haven't read the book they want banned.\"</p> <p>Frenchtown Summer is unlikely to upset anyone, unless they have an objection to good writing.

He is \"as unknown as a foreign language\", but at the crucial moment he manages to affirm his love for his son in the tiniest of gestures.</p> <p>Like many authors whose books are marketed for teenagers, Cormier has had times when he wishes that his work was held in higher esteem, but he is quick to point out: \"I've had such success it would be a betrayal of my readers to say the Young Adult label has been detrimental. It is the most demanding, most critical audience in the world. Though I'm always puzzled how anyone can set out to write for a 14-year-old. With my books it just happens that's who they end up for.

How far is it tied in with her love of Egypt? In describing this land she becomes a poet: \"In Upper Egypt the trees are full of egrets, who hang at dusk like handkerchiefs, and say buggle buggle da, buggle da, burbling like shishas. Written down the words even look like Arabic. And the sky is striped, green and rose and gold, the colours of alabaster, and the moon lies on its back.\" </p> <p>This is also an honest look at the dilemma of loving two men, both of them good and worthy.

The horror!\" Since the publication of Heart of Darkness in 1899, Kurtz's ghastly ululation has become the literary equivalent of Edvard Munch's The Scream. It anticipates the psycho-social disintegration and moral infernos about which Eliot and Adorno later wrote. Staled by repetition, it's also a melodramatic catchphrase for when you ladder your tights or spill latte on your lap. </p> <p>Some critics have taken issue with Conrad's depiction of the Congo as a malevolent black hole sucking out European vitality, a diseased abyss bereft of joy or humanity whose inhabitants march to the beat of a frenzied tom-tom. Yet the imaginative territory that it represents has lured generations of writers from Naipaul and Mailer to William Boyd and Ronan Bennett. Querry, the jaded church architect in Graham Greene's A Burnt-Out Case, goes there because he craves \"an empty place\", one where he can abandon his self. In the travelogues of Redmond O'Hanlon, by contrast, self and epic masculinity are flexed against tropical swelter and discomfort. </p> <p>The Congo, it seems, offers authors many attractions: a vivid topography, a literary genealogy, a fascinating history (much of it pocked by imperialist rapacity), a crucible for the West in its encounters with \"otherness\", a poetics of extinction. </p> <p>Many of these themes crop up in Robert Edric's The Book of the Heathen. The novel tells the story of James Frasier, a young man educated at Oxford and Sandhurst who is appointed map-maker and technical overseer for a company trading in the Congo at the end of the 19th century. He is accompanied by Nicholas Frere, who has been courting his sister and whose intrepid, free-spirited demeanour he envies.</p> <p>They arrive to find a claustrophobic dread hanging over their station. Colleagues are glowering and unhelpful, business is waning fast, a local potentate traffics in slaves, and the nearby mission school is run by a vicious demagogue, Father Klein.

      "bodyText": "The Book of the Heathen Robert Edric Anchor, \u00a39.99, 351pp Buy it at BOL \"The horror! The horror!\" Since the publication of Heart of Darkness in 1899, Kurtz's ghastly ululation has become the literary equivalent of Edvard Munch's The Scream. It anticipates the psycho-social disintegration and moral infernos about which Eliot and Adorno later wrote. Staled by repetition, it's also a melodramatic catchphrase for when you ladder your tights or spill latte on your lap. Some critics have taken issue with Conrad's depiction of the Congo as a malevolent black hole sucking out European vitality, a diseased abyss bereft of joy or humanity whose inhabitants march to the beat of a frenzied tom-tom. Yet the imaginative territory that it represents has lured generations of writers from Naipaul and Mailer to William Boyd and Ronan Bennett. Querry, the jaded church architect in Graham Greene's A Burnt-Out Case, goes there because he craves \"an empty place\", one where he can abandon his self. In the travelogues of Redmond O'Hanlon, by contrast, self and epic masculinity are flexed against tropical swelter and discomfort. The Congo, it seems, offers authors many attractions: a vivid topography, a literary genealogy, a fascinating history (much of it pocked by imperialist rapacity), a crucible for the West in its encounters with \"otherness\", a poetics of extinction. Many of these themes crop up in Robert Edric's The Book of the Heathen. The novel tells the story of James Frasier, a young man educated at Oxford and Sandhurst who is appointed map-maker and technical overseer for a company trading in the Congo at the end of the 19th century. He is accompanied by Nicholas Frere, who has been courting his sister and whose intrepid, free-spirited demeanour he envies. They arrive to find a claustrophobic dread hanging over their station. Colleagues are glowering and unhelpful, business is waning fast, a local potentate traffics in slaves, and the nearby mission school is run by a vicious demagogue, Father Klein. They've travelled thousands of miles and found not the adventure playground they had hoped for, but a putrescent graveyard. They begin to wander further afield in search of newness - and, in Frere's case, cannibalistic ceremonies that no Westerner has previously witnessed. One day, though, Frere is charged with killing a native girl. Frasier's attempts to piece together what really happened form the backbone of the novel. The Book of the Heathen begins with an epigraph from the diary of Roger Casement asking us to consider what the consequences would be if Congolese tribesmen were to pen their own accounts \"of these terrible events, of this shameful history told only once\".

It's a disturbing image, particularly when you consider what the little fellow would have been singing: </p> <p> \"O rose, thou art sick! </p> <p>The invisible worm </p> <p>That flies in the night </p> <p>In the howling storm </p> <p>Has found out thy bed </p> <p>Of crimson joy, </p> <p>And his dark secret love </p> <p>Does thy life destroy.\" </p> <p>And yet these lyrics were (and are) a wonderful introduction to poetry, even for an eight-year-old. Beneath their simplicity are depths explored with extraordinary economy. But to read them is to cast aside childish things: \"the invisible worm\" has its intimations of venereal disease; \"an air that kills\", as Bloom points out, is a superb irony in that the \"breath paradoxically slays, precisely where it should enhance life\". What a precocious little horror Harold must have been. </p> <p>At the age of 70, Bloom hasn't changed much. He still chants. He's still showy and precocious. Above all, he still reads seriously and wears his learning heavily. But you can forgive him the latter because the former is so important in this age. </p> <p>Bloom's iconoclasm is great fun. He laments the death of memorised verse, since that now-dead culture of learning encouraged many people to read great poetry with the requisite attention. For heaven's sake, try harder. Learn more. Read better. Such is his bracing tone. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Bloom loves the poetry of those 19th-century Englishmen who despaired of everything but the strong self and its powers of endurance. Bloom despairs of computers, television, and much more besides. </p> <p>His judgments seem to swoop down from Olympus. Poe is widely popular, Bloom notes, but, really, he wrote atrociously. He reproves Maupassant for wearing Schopenhauerian goggles: the result was that his short stories distorted the vagaries of human desire. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, isn't this just another of Bloom's greatest literary hits, another stroll through the texts of his western canon? Through the Victorian poetry course he taught at NYU; through his favourite American fiction (step forward, neglected Eudora Welty); another climb to the summit of literature that he wrote about so impressively in last year's Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human ? </p> <p>Well, yes, it is all that. But where The Western Canon 's taxonomy became suffocating and joyless, here Bloom's love of great literature is contagious. It sent me off anew to Proust, to Flannery O'Connor, to Italo Calvino; and for the first time to many others - to Cormac McCarthy, to Welty and (to my shame) to Robert Browning. True, sometimes Bloom's readings are too perfunctory to be useful, but all of them are buoyed up by a serious, corrective spirit in an age of too many things that don't matter. \"Information is endlessly available to us; where shall wisdom be found?\" asks Bloom rhetorically.

      "bodyText": "How to Read and Why Harold Bloom Fourth Estate, \u00a315.99, 283pp Buy it at BOL At the age of eight, Harold Bloom used to wander around chanting the verses of Blake and Housman. It's a disturbing image, particularly when you consider what the little fellow would have been singing: \"O rose, thou art sick! The invisible worm That flies in the night In the howling storm Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy.\" And yet these lyrics were (and are) a wonderful introduction to poetry, even for an eight-year-old. Beneath their simplicity are depths explored with extraordinary economy. But to read them is to cast aside childish things: \"the invisible worm\" has its intimations of venereal disease; \"an air that kills\", as Bloom points out, is a superb irony in that the \"breath paradoxically slays, precisely where it should enhance life\". What a precocious little horror Harold must have been. At the age of 70, Bloom hasn't changed much. He still chants. He's still showy and precocious. Above all, he still reads seriously and wears his learning heavily. But you can forgive him the latter because the former is so important in this age. Bloom's iconoclasm is great fun. He laments the death of memorised verse, since that now-dead culture of learning encouraged many people to read great poetry with the requisite attention. For heaven's sake, try harder. Learn more. Read better. Such is his bracing tone. Not surprisingly, Bloom loves the poetry of those 19th-century Englishmen who despaired of everything but the strong self and its powers of endurance. Bloom despairs of computers, television, and much more besides. His judgments seem to swoop down from Olympus. Poe is widely popular, Bloom notes, but, really, he wrote atrociously. He reproves Maupassant for wearing Schopenhauerian goggles: the result was that his short stories distorted the vagaries of human desire. Ultimately, though, isn't this just another of Bloom's greatest literary hits, another stroll through the texts of his western canon? Through the Victorian poetry course he taught at NYU; through his favourite American fiction (step forward, neglected Eudora Welty); another climb to the summit of literature that he wrote about so impressively in last year's Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human ? Well, yes, it is all that. But where The Western Canon 's taxonomy became suffocating and joyless, here Bloom's love of great literature is contagious. It sent me off anew to Proust, to Flannery O'Connor, to Italo Calvino; and for the first time to many others - to Cormac McCarthy, to Welty and (to my shame) to Robert Browning. True, sometimes Bloom's readings are too perfunctory to be useful, but all of them are buoyed up by a serious, corrective spirit in an age of too many things that don't matter. \"Information is endlessly available to us; where shall wisdom be found?\" asks Bloom rhetorically. In the books he hails, for sure. And, frequently, in this book too. Bloom reckons How to Read is not a polemical book, though American academics - and indeed anybody who reads him as seriously as the professor recommends - might disagree. For Bloom, US universities \"have empowered such covens as 'gender and sexuality' and 'multiculturalism' \". Bloom adds angrily: \"A university culture where the appreciation of Victorian women's underwear replaces the appreciation of Charles Dickens and Robert Browning sounds like the outrageousness of a new Nathanael West, but is merely the norm...

And this is not even to mention the incunabula, the masses of journalism and criticism, the libretto, the play, the book for children - and all of them good of their kind. One is reminded of Max Beerbohm, in his essay \"Quia Imperfectum\": \"A man whose career was glorious without intermission, decade after decade, does surely try our patience.\" </p> <p>Now he has written a novel, and according to the dustjacket: \"He has been called the most influential man of the last millennium.

This is his tale, and the story behind his heretical invention.\" This extraordinary individual is not in fact Blake Morrison, but rather the subject of Morrison's book, Johann Gutenberg, inventor of printing. Like all Morrison's work, and for all its range, The Justification of Johann Gutenberg ultimately focuses on that irreducible spot of unhappiness - that little inky stain - at the heart of the human condition. </p> <p>Morrison gives us Gutenberg as an old man, bitter, half-blind, ruined, living in exile in Eltville, dictating his memoirs to a young scribe, dreaming of \"print-pilgrims\" coming to visit him. Gutenberg recalls his parents, his childhood in Mainz, and his schooling. Destined for the church, he gives up his vocation to become a scribe, a coinmaker, a journeyman metalworker, and then a writing master. He falls in love with the beautiful Ennelina, but fails to marry. Unlike Blake Morrison, it takes him some time to settle down to a life of purposefulness. </p> <p>Gutenberg's ultimate purpose is of course the invention of his printing press with movable type, a complex process involving what Morrison calls, rather magically, a \"pentangle of skills\". This part of Gutenberg's story is well known, and Morrison himself acknowledges Albert Kapr's scholarly Johann Gutenberg: The Man and the Invention (1996) as an important source for his novel. Morrison is, however, much less interested in Gutenberg's invention than in its human cost. The book's justification lies not in its description of Gutenberg's famous success but in its account of his many private failings. </p> <p>Morrison's Gutenberg is not a genius, but a fool who sacrifices everything in the pursuit of money, fame, and his own talent. There are numerous illuminating set pieces. A young Gutenberg's first experiment in printing is writing with rat's blood on snow - \"I made bold and swirled the rat about, in a circle, so that a decorative red stain, or curlicue, was deposited, like an illuminated letter at the head of a page.\"</p> <p>The older Gutenberg is pompous, deceitful, and scheming, the kind of man too busy polishing his anecdotes for the generations to come to really care for those around him. He likes to pretend that his big idea comes to him in a vision of doves: \"As I stood with my hand raised, it was as if the dove that perched there spreading its wings had become an open book [...] the grain the dove held in its beak was like a kernel of knowledge seeding itself throughout the world.\" Even he doesn't believe it.

At the same time there are several of those characteristic gaps, limitations and gaucheries that often seem to bedevil the historical novel.</p> <p>The research sometimes struggles for its life, like fish thrashing about on the surface of the Rhine. And knowing what we already know of Morrison's interests and obsessions, Gutenberg does perhaps seem to conform rather too easily to that familiar pattern - sensitive middle-class boy with absent father - whose emotional intricacies Morrison has long since etched and perfected. Indeed, with his thick glasses, prejudices and enthusiasms, Gutenberg begins to look uncannily like a wood-cut Philip Larkin - \"One of those old-type natural fouled-up guys\". </p> <p>Certainly as with Larkin, and one suspects perhaps even as with a committed litt\u00e9rateur like Blake Morrison, Gutenberg's great sadness reveals itself as the realisation of all the love he must give up in order to achieve his dreams. \"Without Ennelina's truth and passion, I was thrown back wholly on inventing.

The line the young rebel speaks to the uncertain Prince - \"if we want everything to stay the same, everything must change\" - has become the motto of conservatives all over Europe. </p> <p>The Sicilian tradition has the robust autonomy of Irish literature, and the same willingness to draw nourishment from non-mainstream cultures. This is very much the case with Andrea Camilleri, the Sicilian detective-story writer who has dominated the bestseller lists in Italy in recent years. He writes in a mixture of standard Italian and Sicilian, and - in an explicit act of homage to the Catalan writer Vazquez Montalban - his detective is called Montalbano. Montalbano's investigations are liable to be disturbed by a good restaurant or by a favourite traditional dish cooked by some witness to a crime. </p> <p>The master of sophisticated detective fiction remains Leonardo Sciascia, whose novels are an extended investigation into what it means to be Sicilian. Sciascia entrusts his investigations to a series of low-ranking police officers, who find themselves crushed between criminals and corrupt servants of the state. Novels like The Day of the Owl or To Each His Own focus on a local mafia in Sicily, but the later Equal Danger (all Carcanet) deals with a new, globalised criminal force that operates in boardrooms and inside ministries. </p> <p>Claudio Magris, meanwhile, lives at the opposite end of the Italian peninsula from Sicily, but he shows the same attachment to his own place, Trieste. James Joyce lived in Trieste, and there he met up with Italo Svevo, author of Confessions of Zeno. Magris is a writer of some imaginative and intellectual scope. His best book remains Danube, but if that is not suitable reading for an Italian excursion, his more recent Microcosms (Harvill) should pass muster. Both Joyce and Svevo have walk-on parts, but the most representative character is the man who loves Trieste \"because he had the impression of being nowhere\". </p> <p>The most \"Italian\" of writers, in the sense of the one who refuses association with one region, is probably Sebastiano Vassalli, from Novara. Night of the Comet retells the tragic story of the poet, Dino Campana, from Northern Italy, while Vassalli had the courage, or foolhardiness, to choose Sicily as the setting of The Swan (Carcanet), a historical novel dealing with a mafia murder in the 19th century. </p> <p>There are younger contemporaries who proudly group themselves together under the title The Cannibals, and who appeal, like Irvine Welsh in Britain, to a supposedly anarchic, iconoclastic youth. Enrico Brizzi set the tone with Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band . Simona Vinci does not number herself with the Cannibals, but there is a repulsive violence in A Game We Play (Weidenfeld), which focuses on the sexuality of children. </p> <p>Those who prefer something gentler will relish Alessandro Baricco, who is beginning to command a following in Britain. His delicate little miniature of a novel, Silk (Harvill), unfolds on the silk trail to China, while Ocean Sea (Hamish Hamilton) is set in an area of the South Seas that would have been familiar to R L Stevenson. </p> <p>Women writers flourish in a way they have never done before in Italy. The doyenne remains Dacia Maraini, whose Voices (Serpent's Tail) is her only venture into the crime story. Paola Capriolo has a rare knack of mingling sophistication and fantasy, as is clear in Floria Tosca, a deft retelling of Puccini's Tosca, or The Woman Watching, (both Serpent's Tail), the story of a woman in the stalls gazing insistently at an actor on stage. </p> <p>Michael Dibdin could pass as an Italian writer who writes in English. He acknowledges a debt to Sciascia, and there is a lot to be learned about the seamier side of Italian politics from the investigations of his Aurelio Zen, a Venetian policeman investigating crimes that spring from the overlap between organised crime and disorganised politics. A Long Finish took him to the vineyards of Piedmont, while Blood Rain (both Faber) saw him involved in a mafia affair in Sicily. Which is where we started.</p> <p><strong>Little Italy</strong></p> <p><strong> The Italian Institute</strong> (39 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8NX) has a library of 21,000 books, in Italian and English translation. During its September literary season of events, many famous Italian authors (including Dacia Maraini and Alessandro Barrico) will be in London for talks with British authors. In October, Italian and British actors, including Colin Firth, will be giving a series of readings from Italian books.

There are younger contemporaries who proudly group themselves together under the title The Cannibals, and who appeal, like Irvine Welsh in Britain, to a supposedly anarchic, iconoclastic youth. Enrico Brizzi set the tone with Jack Frusciante Has Left the Band . Simona Vinci does not number herself with the Cannibals, but there is a repulsive violence in A Game We Play (Weidenfeld), which focuses on the sexuality of children. Those who prefer something gentler will relish Alessandro Baricco, who is beginning to command a following in Britain. His delicate little miniature of a novel, Silk (Harvill), unfolds on the silk trail to China, while Ocean Sea (Hamish Hamilton) is set in an area of the South Seas that would have been familiar to R L Stevenson. Women writers flourish in a way they have never done before in Italy. The doyenne remains Dacia Maraini, whose Voices (Serpent's Tail) is her only venture into the crime story. Paola Capriolo has a rare knack of mingling sophistication and fantasy, as is clear in Floria Tosca, a deft retelling of Puccini's Tosca, or The Woman Watching, (both Serpent's Tail), the story of a woman in the stalls gazing insistently at an actor on stage. Michael Dibdin could pass as an Italian writer who writes in English. He acknowledges a debt to Sciascia, and there is a lot to be learned about the seamier side of Italian politics from the investigations of his Aurelio Zen, a Venetian policeman investigating crimes that spring from the overlap between organised crime and disorganised politics. A Long Finish took him to the vineyards of Piedmont, while Blood Rain (both Faber) saw him involved in a mafia affair in Sicily. Which is where we started. Little Italy The Italian Institute (39 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8NX) has a library of 21,000 books, in Italian and English translation. During its September literary season of events, many famous Italian authors (including Dacia Maraini and Alessandro Barrico) will be in London for talks with British authors. In October, Italian and British actors, including Colin Firth, will be giving a series of readings from Italian books. See www.italcultur.org.uk or phone 020-7235 1461 for a programme.",

So just who is entitled to what and when - and how much will the alumni-to-be have to pay for their studies? </p> <p>If you are English, Welsh or Northern Irish and starting a university course in England, Wales or Northern Ireland this September, you will have to pay \u00a31,050 towards the cost of your course fees, regardless of whether you are going to take up church studies or astrophysics. This effectively means you pay an average of \u00a31 in every \u00a37.50 of the course fee. </p> <p>This, however, is means tested - if your gross family income is below \u00a317,805 you will pay nothing, and if it is between this and \u00a333,000 you make a contribution on a sliding scale. According to the government, this means around one third of students will pay the full fee, a third pay something and a third pay nothing at all. </p> <p>Although the days of highly subsidised student life are long gone, loans are available to students with no interest payable until after graduation - known as, unsurprisingly, the student loan. The maximum loan under this arrangement for the coming academic year will be \u00a34,590, for a student living away from home and studying in London. This goes down to \u00a33,725 for students outside London and to just \u00a32,950 for those who opt to live with their parents during the academic year. </p> <p>Loans must be applied for at least one calender month before the course starts. If you are going to study abroad, different loan levels are available. Repayment will need to start when you earn more than \u00a310,000 a year before tax. </p> <p>There are some other forms of financial support available on a non-repayable basis, however. If you are a single parent and a student you may claim additional benefit, for instance. If you have dependants - children or a spouse or, if you are over 25, a co-habiting partner - you will also be entitled to benefit. The amount is means tested on the dependant's income. </p> <p>Hardship loans are also available, although these cannot be relied on as the money is granted at the discretion of the Student Loan Company and the biggest sum is just \u00a3500. This is offered to students who have applied for the maximum loan and received at least one instalment. This will also have to be repaid in the future; the same repayment scheme applies as for the standard student loan. </p> <p>If you have to attend college for longer than the usual term time of 30 weeks you are entitled to an additional payment. This is \u00a345 a week for those living at home, \u00a386 for students living away from home and studying in London and \u00a365 for those away from home outside the capital. </p> <p>Mature students and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds may also apply for a discretionary access bursary. These are granted by individual universities and do not have to be repaid. The maximum available is \u00a31,000. As each institution will only be able to offer a limited number of these, you should apply as quickly as possible. </p> <p>Scottish students, meanwhile, are at a distinct advantage to their English and Welsh counterparts. Those who opt to study in their own country can tap into a means-tested loan of up to \u00a33,725 as well as a non-means tested one of up to \u00a31,745 if they are to live in halls or digs or \u00a31,165 if they stay in the parental home. The income threshold for means testing is \u00a317,805. They are also exempt from course fees. </p> <p>Scottish students who opt to study south of the border are subject to the same loan and fee rules as their English and Welsh counterparts. </p> <p>\"We are delighted that the Scottish executive decided to abolish tuition fees, although we are still concerned about student hardship,\" says a spokesman from NUS Scotland. Although the overall financing packages for students have increased in line with inflation, the NUS calculates that there will still be a substantial shortfall between money available and the expenses students will face. For the next year the cash gap will be \u00a33,300 for students outside London, rising to \u00a34,000 for those at college in the capital. </p> <p>According to research by Barclays, graduate debt continues to rise - by 17% last year and by more than 100% since 1994, although, according to NatWest, one in five students are still graduating with no debt at all. The average amount owed to the Stu dent Loan Company, banks, credit card providers and parents is now \u00a34,497 for a person who has just left college. Coupled with a decline in the average graduate salary, this is worrying news for students. </p> <p> The DfEE publishes a leaflet Financial Support for Higher Education Students in 2000/2001, which is available by calling 0800-731-9133 or see the website <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk\">www.dfee.gov.uk</a> For the Student Loan Company tel 0800-405010.</p>",

Scottish students who opt to study south of the border are subject to the same loan and fee rules as their English and Welsh counterparts. \"We are delighted that the Scottish executive decided to abolish tuition fees, although we are still concerned about student hardship,\" says a spokesman from NUS Scotland. Although the overall financing packages for students have increased in line with inflation, the NUS calculates that there will still be a substantial shortfall between money available and the expenses students will face. For the next year the cash gap will be \u00a33,300 for students outside London, rising to \u00a34,000 for those at college in the capital. According to research by Barclays, graduate debt continues to rise - by 17% last year and by more than 100% since 1994, although, according to NatWest, one in five students are still graduating with no debt at all. The average amount owed to the Stu dent Loan Company, banks, credit card providers and parents is now \u00a34,497 for a person who has just left college. Coupled with a decline in the average graduate salary, this is worrying news for students. The DfEE publishes a leaflet Financial Support for Higher Education Students in 2000/2001, which is available by calling 0800-731-9133 or see the website www.dfee.gov.uk For the Student Loan Company tel 0800-405010.",

But what does the future hold for non-graduates? The short answer is less money. </p> <p>According to the Higher Education Career's Service Unit university graduates in their early 20s can expect to earn 29% more than their non-graduate peers. As they get older, the wage differential widens. By their early 40s, male graduates will be earning 66% more than men who didn't go to university and women graduates 87% more than their female counterparts. </p> <p>To put a figure on it: graduates can expect a starting salary averaging \u00a315,500 if they are male and \u00a313,800 if they are female, while non-graduates will get only around \u00a312,000 if they are male and \u00a310,100 if female. By the time they reach their early 40s, male graduates will be taking home around \u00a335,000 a year and female graduates around \u00a325,000, while non-graduates of the same sex can expect salaries of around \u00a320,000 and \u00a314,000 respectively. </p> <p>You can prosper without a degree, of course. With A-levels in law, English and sociology, Direct Line PR executive Katharine Watson qualified for university, but the prospect did not appeal. It was only when she moved to London from Devon that she found enormous prejudice against non-graduates. </p> <p>\"Some recruitment agencies wouldn't even look at me,\" she says. \"Two and a half years' work experience did not seem to count.\" When she finally landed a job with Bell Pottinger PR 24-year-old Katharine felt the need to get some qualifications and took a Communications, Advertising and Media certificate through part-time study. </p> <p>Now \"up there with the best of them\" in salary terms, she does not regret going straight into the world of work. Her advice to other non-graduate job-seekers: \"Don't be fazed. It takes perserverance and there will be knock-backs. Be focused on the area of work you are interested in. You have got to have determination to be successful.\" Even so, university graduates are much less likely to be unemployed. Spring 2000 figures from the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) put the unemployment rate for those with first degrees at 2.4%, roughly half the national average of 5.6%. </p> <p>On top of this, graduates seem to get more holiday time - at least in their early 20s - working around 10.2 months a year as opposed to the 11 months worked by non-graduates. But it's worth remembering that there is far more to further education than a university degree. Vocational A-levels will be launched next month, covering a wide range of subjects including art and design, engineering, information and communications technology and media, arts and entertainment. These will be available through secondary schools and colleges and will be followed by vocational GCSEs in September 2002. National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), available through further eduction colleges, are another option, usually taken by people who already have some A-Levels. </p> <p>Offered in a wide variety of subjects, NVQs are designed to develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed for work in a broad occupational area. They also focus on developing the all-important \"employability\" skills: the basic keyboarding, presentation and communication skills which companies say are all too lacking among today's youth. If a particular industry or sector appeals to you, an NVQ should give you enough understanding and confidence to get your foot in the door. And while apprenticeships may evoke images of the sweatshop conditions described in a Charles Dickens' novel, modern versions are available in more than 80 sectors including accountancy, air transport, electronic systems, insurance, security and the water industry. </p> <p>The government has also launched a scheme called Learndirect to promote the concept of lifelong learning. The scheme offers 300 courses on subjects as diverse as keyboarding, business and retail which can be studied over the internet or at a regional Learndirect centre. More details can be found at <a href=\"http://www.learndirect.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.learndirect.co.uk</a> or by phoning 0800-100-900. Your local library and job centre should also be able to help you with finding a course. If money is a problem, individual learning accounts (ILAs) which give you up to \u00a3150 to put towards the cost of a course should help. However, evening and part-time courses, especially those offered by local further education colleges can be very good value and it's worth shopping around not only to find the cheapest, but to find the most suitable. It's also worth remembering that many colleges let students pay in instalments, helping to spread the burden. </p>",

On top of this, graduates seem to get more holiday time - at least in their early 20s - working around 10.2 months a year as opposed to the 11 months worked by non-graduates. But it's worth remembering that there is far more to further education than a university degree. Vocational A-levels will be launched next month, covering a wide range of subjects including art and design, engineering, information and communications technology and media, arts and entertainment. These will be available through secondary schools and colleges and will be followed by vocational GCSEs in September 2002. National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), available through further eduction colleges, are another option, usually taken by people who already have some A-Levels. Offered in a wide variety of subjects, NVQs are designed to develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed for work in a broad occupational area. They also focus on developing the all-important \"employability\" skills: the basic keyboarding, presentation and communication skills which companies say are all too lacking among today's youth. If a particular industry or sector appeals to you, an NVQ should give you enough understanding and confidence to get your foot in the door. And while apprenticeships may evoke images of the sweatshop conditions described in a Charles Dickens' novel, modern versions are available in more than 80 sectors including accountancy, air transport, electronic systems, insurance, security and the water industry. The government has also launched a scheme called Learndirect to promote the concept of lifelong learning. The scheme offers 300 courses on subjects as diverse as keyboarding, business and retail which can be studied over the internet or at a regional Learndirect centre. More details can be found at www.learndirect.co.uk or by phoning 0800-100-900. Your local library and job centre should also be able to help you with finding a course. If money is a problem, individual learning accounts (ILAs) which give you up to \u00a3150 to put towards the cost of a course should help. However, evening and part-time courses, especially those offered by local further education colleges can be very good value and it's worth shopping around not only to find the cheapest, but to find the most suitable. It's also worth remembering that many colleges let students pay in instalments, helping to spread the burden.",

Here are some of them, with Standard Life's responses. </p> <p> <strong> Why does Standard Life oppose demutualisation when demutualisation would be good for most, if not all, existing policyholders?</strong> </p> <p> We believe very strongly that mutuality is best for the company and that the change of structure and focus demutualisation would bring would damage the business ... our mutual status allows us to focus exclusively on the interests of the members and policyholders ... although members who have policies which have been running for many years might be net beneficiaries from a demutualisation, this would not necessarily be the case for others.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Hart, leader of one of the groups challenging Standard Life, met with the company this week and submitted a list of questions he wanted answers to. Here are some of them, with Standard Life's responses. Why does Standard Life oppose demutualisation when demutualisation would be good for most, if not all, existing policyholders? We believe very strongly that mutuality is best for the company and that the change of structure and focus demutualisation would bring would damage the business ... our mutual status allows us to focus exclusively on the interests of the members and policyholders ... although members who have policies which have been running for many years might be net beneficiaries from a demutualisation, this would not necessarily be the case for others. In particular, new policies and increased contributions would not be covered by any ring-fencing agreement [when an insurer demutualises, steps are taken to protect existing policies from future bonus reductions caused by the need to pay dividends to shareholders].

Mr Morrell, 30, decided he wanted to move his current account from the Halifax because he was fed-up with the disloyalty charges it imposes for withdrawing money from non-Halifax and HSBC cash machines. A friend told him about Smile, which has no charges for ATM withdrawals and offers a good rate of interest for a current account - 4.75%. </p> <p>The bank's website certainly makes it all sound pretty painless. \"Opening a Smile current account is easy. And if you'd like to switch your existing current account to Smile, we'll make it as quick and trouble-free as possible,\" it states. You simply give a few details online and it provides you with a set of prepared letters you can print and send out to redirect your existing direct debits, standing orders, salary and any other payments to your new Smile account. </p> <p>Once you've posted your letters off, your existing bank has 10 working days in which to provide Smile with your details. As soon as Smile receives them, it sends you a copy and you confirm which payments you want to transfer. After that, the switch should take only a few days to complete. </p> <p>Mr Morrell, a Tyne Tees TV journalist of Whickham, Newcastle upon Tyne, says a date was agreed for the end of June for the transfer of his account to take place. \"One or two companies sent me new direct debit mandates which I filled in but, as for the others, I was assured by Smile that those payments would be made without the need to fill out new forms. </p> <p>\"Then the problems began - a phone company hadn't got its money and threatened to suspend the service.

I've had some nasty letters - it's embarrassing and I'm sure it has not done my creditworthiness any good. I feel as though I've been fobbed off and they haven't lived up to the promises in their publicity.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Smile describes Mr Morrell's experiences as a \"one-off\". He says that the day after Smile received a letter from Mr Morrell confirming which payments he wanted to transfer over to his Smile account, it sent out all the new direct debit mandates to the companies involved requesting they start to claim their money from the new bank on June 26. </p> <p>\"All that was done and everything seemed to be OK. The problem lies with the third-party companies which are involved. They haven't set their mandates up - some have, but there are quite a lot that haven't,\" says Smile. </p> <p>The spokesman adds it has contacted the companies that are still outstanding and asked them to send new direct debit mandates to Mr Morrell to sign. It has also offered him a \u00a315 payment to make up for the problems he has experienced. </p> <p>\"This is a trial system and it has been successful but there will always be isolated cases. We feel the system is better than what was previously there, where the customer had to do it all themselves,\" says the spokesman. </p> <p>Smile says its advice to people generally is that, when switching their current accounts, they should keep enough money in their old account to cover the usual payments just in case there is a problem. </p> <p><strong>Piloting a complicated course</strong></p> <p>The problems experienced by Jonathan Morrell sum up why many people never get round to changing their bank - they're worried things will go wrong. </p> <p>But the banks insist that a pilot account-switching scheme is making the whole process easier and less stressful. </p> <p>More than a dozen banks and building societies are taking part in the \"current account transfer scheme\" which started last autumn. It aims to enable payments like direct debits and standing orders to be moved seamlessly from a customer's old account to the new one. </p> <p>The plan is that a fully automated sys tem will be available to all customers by the end of 2001. Until then we will have to make do with the pilot scheme, which the banks say is a big improvement over the old system. </p> <p>One survey found that 83% of people haven't changed their current account in the past five years and 50% of people have never changed their current account provider. </p> <p>The new bank contacts your existing bank, which then has 10 days to produce a list of your direct debits and other payments. The new bank contacts the companies and instructs them to amend direct debit instructions and include new bank details.

      "body": "<p>Going to university ought to be about expanding the intellect while learning to be socially independent. Increasingly, it is about scraping together just enough money to live. </p> <p>For students, the economic decline has been a gradual process. In 1984 the minimum maintenance grant (then \u00a3410) was halved and student travel costs reimbursement axed. Two years later, mandatory entitlement to supplementary and unemployment benefits was withdrawn. That same month, housing benefit for those living in hall was chopped, too. </p> <p>Almost all students questioned by Barcalys Bank this month were in debt. Just 8% were not and the average debt has shot up to \u00a34,339, a startling 25% increase on just 12 months ago. Escalating salaries for graduates in some areas mean that those debts will be paid quickly. The latest tale of super soaraway salaries has it that City law firms are paying as much as \u00a340,000, for example. But that is of little comfort to those starting out in higher education. </p> <p>Rent accounts for half student expenditure, although this should be put in context; students spend the biggest chunk of their outgoings on going out. The nationwide average rent is \u00a345 a week, ranging from \u00a322 in the Fenham area of Newcastle-upon-Tyne to London where the city-wide mean is \u00a387, according to the National Union of Students. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the majority of students will have to borrow money at some time during their studies. Credit Action, a charity which aims to help people manage their money, says banks and building societies are the good guys, as they charge nothing if borrowing is kept within a certain limit, even if they do try to lure new customers with fool's gold in the form of free CD vouchers. </p> <p>Next, in order of preference, are the finance houses which charge around 15% on money loaned, followed by store cards at an average of 25%, then licenced money lenders, who, it warns, can charge up to 100%. Loan sharks should be avoided at all costs. </p> <p>These days, many students find work during term time as well as the vacations. The majority of colleges now have job shops, similar to the job centre, which is separate to the careers or internship offices. </p> <p>According to Dominic Drane, manager of the student employment office at Anglia Polytechnic University, around three in four students work while they study. And Clair Rees, director of the career service at York University, says college is increasingly becoming a preparation ground for employment with today's students - unlike many of the their 80s and 90s counterparts - acquiring the work-life skills required in the \"real world\" of work. </p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge ban their students from finding jobs, but other universities recognise the need to prevent undergraduates being distracted from their studies. Dominic Drane says the average workload for students is 15 hours a week - the limit that is applied at York. The majority of these jobs are in traditional student areas such as bars and restaurants. Most will either receive the minimum wage of \u00a33.60 a hour, or more if work is plentiful. </p> <p>Mr Drane, who is also head of the National Association of Student Employment Staff, says: \"In our area there are plenty of part-time jobs for people who want to work and the wages are accordingly slightly higher. That may not be the case in south Wales, for instance.\" Some job shops employ the students themselves, just as a recruitment agency would. Anglia's job shop pays an hourly wage of \u00a34.30. </p> <p>Some manage to find jobs which have a passing relevance to their course or intended career. Liverpool's John Moores University, for instance, coordinates a project with local call centres allowing students to work at the weekend or in the evening so they are not obliged to cut classes. </p> <p>Virgin is dangling a slightly more attractive carrot by recruiting students as a salesforce for its mobile phones. Although this new legion of workers are dubbed brand managers, even Virgin admits that the workers will find the pay more useful than the work experience gained. The job entails researching mobile phone use among fellow students, auditing local Virgin Mobile retail outlets, liaising with local and student media and - of course - selling Virgin mobiles to fellow students. </p> <p>Paul Layte, about to enter his final year of a natural science degree at Bath University, says it was not the \u00a3150-a-term wage plus free mobile phone which prompted him to answer an advertisement for student ambassadors, but rather the chance to get involved in something different. To date he has sold two phones and organised a competition. </p> <p>\"I am doing management studies as part of my degree and I am interested in marketing; I find putting plans and proposals together comes quite easily. It is also good experience on my CV,\" he says. </p> <p>The NUS estimates that 1.5m students will work before starting their course in the autumn. One problem is that, however diligent, many are still uncertain of their tax position - unaware that they could be boosting their income by a third if they knew how to claim back tax and, more specifically, if they knew to ask employers for a P38 (S) form, so tax would not be deducted from the wage packet. </p> <p>According to Barclays Bank, the student loan is now the primary source of income for almost half of students and the number citing access funds or hardship loans as a source of income has increased fourfold since last year. More than 50% of students manage to save an average of \u00a31,680 and parents, accordingly, are being relied on less. In fact, there has been a 22% decrease in parental funding and this year 16% of people going to college received nothing from their parents, against 9% in 1999. </p> <p> The BBC has a helpsite - <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/essentials\">www.bbc.co.uk/essentials</a> - aimed at 15- to 24-year-olds. Credit Action operates a freephone student helpline on 0800-591-084.</p>",

Mr Drane, who is also head of the National Association of Student Employment Staff, says: \"In our area there are plenty of part-time jobs for people who want to work and the wages are accordingly slightly higher. That may not be the case in south Wales, for instance.\" Some job shops employ the students themselves, just as a recruitment agency would. Anglia's job shop pays an hourly wage of \u00a34.30. Some manage to find jobs which have a passing relevance to their course or intended career. Liverpool's John Moores University, for instance, coordinates a project with local call centres allowing students to work at the weekend or in the evening so they are not obliged to cut classes. Virgin is dangling a slightly more attractive carrot by recruiting students as a salesforce for its mobile phones. Although this new legion of workers are dubbed brand managers, even Virgin admits that the workers will find the pay more useful than the work experience gained. The job entails researching mobile phone use among fellow students, auditing local Virgin Mobile retail outlets, liaising with local and student media and - of course - selling Virgin mobiles to fellow students. Paul Layte, about to enter his final year of a natural science degree at Bath University, says it was not the \u00a3150-a-term wage plus free mobile phone which prompted him to answer an advertisement for student ambassadors, but rather the chance to get involved in something different. To date he has sold two phones and organised a competition. \"I am doing management studies as part of my degree and I am interested in marketing; I find putting plans and proposals together comes quite easily. It is also good experience on my CV,\" he says. The NUS estimates that 1.5m students will work before starting their course in the autumn. One problem is that, however diligent, many are still uncertain of their tax position - unaware that they could be boosting their income by a third if they knew how to claim back tax and, more specifically, if they knew to ask employers for a P38 (S) form, so tax would not be deducted from the wage packet. According to Barclays Bank, the student loan is now the primary source of income for almost half of students and the number citing access funds or hardship loans as a source of income has increased fourfold since last year. More than 50% of students manage to save an average of \u00a31,680 and parents, accordingly, are being relied on less. In fact, there has been a 22% decrease in parental funding and this year 16% of people going to college received nothing from their parents, against 9% in 1999. The BBC has a helpsite - www.bbc.co.uk/essentials - aimed at 15- to 24-year-olds. Credit Action operates a freephone student helpline on 0800-591-084.",

      "body": "<p>When budgets are tight, spending money on possibilities rather than certainties is a difficult choice. This could be why fewer than 10% of students take out insurance against theft, fire or accidental damage to belongings. </p> <p>Insurance is hardly a sexy subject, but, according to insurers who specialise in the student market, a claim is made on around one student policy in 10, showing there is need for this kind of cover. </p> <p>Brian Wright of Saxon Insurance points out that in big cities - which tend to have the highest crime rates - students live in a few areas, making them easy targets for burglars. \"Students also have the type of equipment, such as computers and stereos, which can easily be sold on. And it is not unusual to find six students living together, so the burglar has access to all that times six.\" </p> <p>One student is burgled every four minutes, and even this, according to insurer Endsleigh, is a conservative figure. Endsleigh, set up in the early 60s in conjunction with the National Union of Students, was the first player in the student market when, according to a spokesman: \"The drugs, peace and free-love reputation of students meant they were seen as a risk by traditional insurers.\" Campus and Saxon are its only student-specialist competitors. All provide basic cover and, for higher premiums, cover for bikes and musical instruments. </p> <p>Saxon offers the only policy specifically for halls of residence. It also offers a general plan for people living out of halls. The cover is the same: \u00a32,500 worth of goods including computer insurance up to \u00a3500, but, because of the lower risk, the halls policy is cheaper at \u00a324 a year against \u00a332. </p> <p>There is also an online budget version at \u00a315, but the maximum cover is only \u00a31,500. But these are the lowest rates, offered only in low-crime towns. Study in the most expensive cities, such as Manchester, Liverpool or Leeds, and you will pay \u00a376 for the same cover. </p> <p>Saxon has just three bandwidths, so it may be cheaper for students living in London, as it puts the capital in the cheapest category, with cover starting from \u00a328 a year. For this, personal possessions are covered with no maximum, although there is a limit to \u00a3250 for any single item. Computers are covered up to the value of \u00a3500. </p> <p>The Campus policies offered by insurer Student-World, can be bought for the entire three-year period. Students in the most expensive areas will pay \u00a3158 for the three years and London dwellers between \u00a3117-\u00a3122. </p> <p>Endsleigh splits the country into 10 areas for rating purposes. Most pricey areas include parts of Coventry, Birmingham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Teesside and Wolverhampton, where even the shallowest cover level of \u00a32,000 will cost \u00a396 a year. Students at Brighton, Loughborough and Cambridge will pay the lowest price of \u00a332.50 for \u00a32,500 of cover with Endsleigh. </p> <p>Before buying a policy it makes sense to check whether your university has a block policy which covers students in its halls and other forms of accommodation. Many do, but where there is no block cover it could make sense to insure your possessions even in this protected environment - two years ago the halls of residence of a major university were razed in a fire. </p> <p>You may find your parents' home and contents insurance will cover you at your term-time residence. Many policies don't - they are frequently post code specific - and even if they do, it may not be worth breaking a no-claims record. You would have to prove violent entry in the case of theft, whereas the Saxon policy pays out even in \"walk-in\" cases. </p> <p>Even parents can take out insurance. Saxon's Unishield policy covers against loss of fees paid if a student should drop out of their course, as well as accident, sickness and unemployment cover. On average, 17% of students fail to complete their studies, rising to 35% on some courses, and parents as well as students can be left with expensive liabilities to the university, banks and Student Loans Company. According to Saxon, the most common reason for early bailing out are sickness, change of mind, sports and motor accidents and pregnancy. </p> <p>The cautious parent who opts to take out fee, loan and \"parent\" (that is, accident and sickness) shields would pay from \u00a327.91 a month. </p> <p> Saxon Insurance Services 01159-676-600; Endsleigh <a href=\"http://www.endsleigh.co.uk\">www.endsleigh.co.uk</a>; <a href=\"http://www.studentinsurance.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Campus Insurance</a> or call 0845-330-1408.</p>",

Insurance is hardly a sexy subject, but, according to insurers who specialise in the student market, a claim is made on around one student policy in 10, showing there is need for this kind of cover. Brian Wright of Saxon Insurance points out that in big cities - which tend to have the highest crime rates - students live in a few areas, making them easy targets for burglars. \"Students also have the type of equipment, such as computers and stereos, which can easily be sold on. And it is not unusual to find six students living together, so the burglar has access to all that times six.\" One student is burgled every four minutes, and even this, according to insurer Endsleigh, is a conservative figure. Endsleigh, set up in the early 60s in conjunction with the National Union of Students, was the first player in the student market when, according to a spokesman: \"The drugs, peace and free-love reputation of students meant they were seen as a risk by traditional insurers.\" Campus and Saxon are its only student-specialist competitors. All provide basic cover and, for higher premiums, cover for bikes and musical instruments. Saxon offers the only policy specifically for halls of residence. It also offers a general plan for people living out of halls. The cover is the same: \u00a32,500 worth of goods including computer insurance up to \u00a3500, but, because of the lower risk, the halls policy is cheaper at \u00a324 a year against \u00a332. There is also an online budget version at \u00a315, but the maximum cover is only \u00a31,500. But these are the lowest rates, offered only in low-crime towns. Study in the most expensive cities, such as Manchester, Liverpool or Leeds, and you will pay \u00a376 for the same cover. Saxon has just three bandwidths, so it may be cheaper for students living in London, as it puts the capital in the cheapest category, with cover starting from \u00a328 a year. For this, personal possessions are covered with no maximum, although there is a limit to \u00a3250 for any single item. Computers are covered up to the value of \u00a3500. The Campus policies offered by insurer Student-World, can be bought for the entire three-year period. Students in the most expensive areas will pay \u00a3158 for the three years and London dwellers between \u00a3117-\u00a3122. Endsleigh splits the country into 10 areas for rating purposes. Most pricey areas include parts of Coventry, Birmingham, Newcastle, Sunderland, Teesside and Wolverhampton, where even the shallowest cover level of \u00a32,000 will cost \u00a396 a year. Students at Brighton, Loughborough and Cambridge will pay the lowest price of \u00a332.50 for \u00a32,500 of cover with Endsleigh. Before buying a policy it makes sense to check whether your university has a block policy which covers students in its halls and other forms of accommodation. Many do, but where there is no block cover it could make sense to insure your possessions even in this protected environment - two years ago the halls of residence of a major university were razed in a fire. You may find your parents' home and contents insurance will cover you at your term-time residence. Many policies don't - they are frequently post code specific - and even if they do, it may not be worth breaking a no-claims record. You would have to prove violent entry in the case of theft, whereas the Saxon policy pays out even in \"walk-in\" cases. Even parents can take out insurance. Saxon's Unishield policy covers against loss of fees paid if a student should drop out of their course, as well as accident, sickness and unemployment cover. On average, 17% of students fail to complete their studies, rising to 35% on some courses, and parents as well as students can be left with expensive liabilities to the university, banks and Student Loans Company. According to Saxon, the most common reason for early bailing out are sickness, change of mind, sports and motor accidents and pregnancy. The cautious parent who opts to take out fee, loan and \"parent\" (that is, accident and sickness) shields would pay from \u00a327.91 a month.

      "body": "<p>The playwright Dennis Potter once explained that he had decided to write for TV rather than the theatre because only television offered the possibility of a \"common culture\": one in which people of all classes and generations experienced the same event simultaneously and talked about it the next morning. </p> <p>No Potter of today would go into television for that reason. Technological developments in transmission - with programmes in the future to be delivered through computers and telephones - are generally expected to make viewing a fragmented and isolated experience. In this envisaged world in which viewers become their own schedulers, you will watch Friends at 3.30am on a Tuesday if you decide to. Only a dramatic news event - the sudden death of a princess, for example - will unite the audience. </p> <p>Yesterday, though, the internet - frequently predicted killer of the common culture - offered a shared viewing experience of an unusually powerful kind. In offices - or at least hi-tech, media-friendly offices - employees crouched round computer screens to watch the live web transmission from the house in East London where the surviving seven contestants in Channel 4's house-share elimination game-show Big Brother had rounded on stockbroker Nick Bateman, the series' villain, after discovering evidence of what viewers already knew: that he was breaking the game's rules by playing the contestants off against each other. </p> <p>Bateman was already established as the stand-out character of Big Brother, a series which has managed to combine compelling voyeurism with genuine psychological revelation. While the rest of the 10 seemed to have calculated that the best way to avoid being voted out of the house was to be pleasant or inoffensive on screen, Nick was duplicitous and scheming. The Sun newspaper - which, like most of the British press, runs at least one story about the programme every day - intensified anti-Nick sentiment among viewers by alleging that he had broken the game rules of total seclusion by hiding a tiny mobile phone in his sponge bag. The claim later became more lurid: the tiny receiver was strapped behind his testicles. </p> <p>During the early hours of Thursday morning, evidence of Nick's scheming - a pen and paper, which he used to pass illicit notes to housemates - was discovered by the contestants. The suspension of the supposedly 24-hour internet transmission for two hours led to rumours (denied by Channel 4) of a punch-up. But - yesterday lunchtime - Nick faced his fellow residents with a Clintonian explanation for his actions, blaming a large family and employment in the City for his competitive tendencies. Showing once again the sophisticated understanding of the modern media that has marked him out from the others, Bateman is then reported to have negotiated safe passage to a London hotel and asked for sessions with a psychiatrist. He left the house late yesterday afternoon. A show that has become a live factual version of Lord of the Flies had lost its Lord of the Lies. </p> <p>People in homes and offices unable to receive broadcasts on the internet kept up with developments in the house through email and mobile phones. Technology expected to divide and isolate was unifying people around this media phenomenon of the summer of 2000. </p> <p>As a significant moment of television, the rumbling of Nick Bateman is most remarkable for being the first of the medium's high spots not actually to have occurred on TV. It is the first television hit in which the scheduled transmission is almost incidental to the effect. Whereas other celebrated moments of shared viewing - the revelation of JR Ewing's assassin in Dallas, the major weddings and deaths in EastEnders and Coronation Street, the big-money moments on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - commanded audiences of around 20m, Big Brother has achieved television ratings of only 4m. </p> <p>But this small impact has thrown up a disproportionate cultural mushroom-cloud of Sun front pages, broadsheet editorial columns, websites and workplace conversations. This is partly because the series has a compelling concept, but mainly because - through the use of the live web transmission - Big Brother is the first TV show to make serious use of the new viewing possibilities. Another significance of yesterday's scenes was that viewers were for almost the first time watching genuinely unedited events: no presenter or director was mediating the coverage. By the time Nick's departure is seen in conventional form - on Friday's edition of Big Brother - it will seem second-hand to many viewers. This is a remarkable change in the nature of what it means to watch TV. </p> <p>The only drawback to this up-rooting of the couch potato is the one which has always afflicted the internet. Nick's ostracisation could have marked the coming of age of internet broadcasting, but in the event, this was not the case. Like an impotent bridegroom, the worldwide web is always let down at the potentially sweetest moments by the equipment. The infuriating message \"web congestion\" - which will be familiar to those who tried to download either the Starr report or the Louise Woodward judgment - frequently interrupted coverage as the internet again failed to meet demand. </p> <p> This provided a second irony for historians of television in yesterday's office huddles. The second most common prediction about the future of television - apart from the one that shared viewing would no longer occur - was perfection of the image. Widescreen and digital TV were expected to allow programming of absolute clarity. Indeed, I remember writing a few years ago in a television column that the future of the medium was immaculate images watched by smaller and smaller individual audiences. </p> <p>Disproving one half of this bet by becoming talking-point TV, Big Brother - in its web-cam manifestation at least - also knocks down the other half, because the pictures offered are equivalent in quality to the first ever experimental television sets. People huddled excitedly together around a tiny, unreliable image: in a quite unexpected way, the future of television has turned out to mirror its distant past. </p> <p>As for Big Brother's hold on its audience, the Nick transmissions may represent the peak. Channel 4 has consistently denied that the game is manipulated by the programme-makers in any way. But, if so, their scrupulous honesty has been rewarded by remarkable good luck. What was called for dramatically at this halfway mark of the series is something very like what happened yesterday. It is the point at which a dramatist or screenwriter would have had the group turning against one of their number. </p> <p>But anyone writing or directing the events would also understand that Nick - as the dramatic engine of the piece - needed to be around for the d\u00e9nouement. It is traditional to lament the prospect of Hamlet without the prince, but Hamlet without Claudius would be equally problematic as a piece of drama. Melodrama - and Big Brother is melodramatic documentary - needs a villain. </p> <p>The shaming of Bateman wasn't remotely equivalent in cultural significance to the shooting of Kennedy or the death of Diana, but it marks a stage in the technology of television revelation. JFK died on amateur celluloid. Diana died on live 24-hour television. Nasty Nick was nixed on the net, a day before you'll see it on a set. </p> <p><strong>Must-see TV: shows that captivated the nation</strong><br> by Jemima Sissons</p> <p><strong> Fawlty Towers: The Germans</strong> </p> <p><strong> First broadcast:</strong> October 24 1975. </p> <p>A concussed Basil Fawlty had some difficulty with his German guests. <br> Fawlty: \"Is there something wrong?\" <br> Guest: \"Will you stop talking about the war.\" <br> \"Me?

In this envisaged world in which viewers become their own schedulers, you will watch Friends at 3.30am on a Tuesday if you decide to. Only a dramatic news event - the sudden death of a princess, for example - will unite the audience. Yesterday, though, the internet - frequently predicted killer of the common culture - offered a shared viewing experience of an unusually powerful kind. In offices - or at least hi-tech, media-friendly offices - employees crouched round computer screens to watch the live web transmission from the house in East London where the surviving seven contestants in Channel 4's house-share elimination game-show Big Brother had rounded on stockbroker Nick Bateman, the series' villain, after discovering evidence of what viewers already knew: that he was breaking the game's rules by playing the contestants off against each other. Bateman was already established as the stand-out character of Big Brother, a series which has managed to combine compelling voyeurism with genuine psychological revelation. While the rest of the 10 seemed to have calculated that the best way to avoid being voted out of the house was to be pleasant or inoffensive on screen, Nick was duplicitous and scheming. The Sun newspaper - which, like most of the British press, runs at least one story about the programme every day - intensified anti-Nick sentiment among viewers by alleging that he had broken the game rules of total seclusion by hiding a tiny mobile phone in his sponge bag. The claim later became more lurid: the tiny receiver was strapped behind his testicles. During the early hours of Thursday morning, evidence of Nick's scheming - a pen and paper, which he used to pass illicit notes to housemates - was discovered by the contestants. The suspension of the supposedly 24-hour internet transmission for two hours led to rumours (denied by Channel 4) of a punch-up. But - yesterday lunchtime - Nick faced his fellow residents with a Clintonian explanation for his actions, blaming a large family and employment in the City for his competitive tendencies. Showing once again the sophisticated understanding of the modern media that has marked him out from the others, Bateman is then reported to have negotiated safe passage to a London hotel and asked for sessions with a psychiatrist. He left the house late yesterday afternoon. A show that has become a live factual version of Lord of the Flies had lost its Lord of the Lies. People in homes and offices unable to receive broadcasts on the internet kept up with developments in the house through email and mobile phones. Technology expected to divide and isolate was unifying people around this media phenomenon of the summer of 2000. As a significant moment of television, the rumbling of Nick Bateman is most remarkable for being the first of the medium's high spots not actually to have occurred on TV. It is the first television hit in which the scheduled transmission is almost incidental to the effect. Whereas other celebrated moments of shared viewing - the revelation of JR Ewing's assassin in Dallas, the major weddings and deaths in EastEnders and Coronation Street, the big-money moments on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? - commanded audiences of around 20m, Big Brother has achieved television ratings of only 4m. But this small impact has thrown up a disproportionate cultural mushroom-cloud of Sun front pages, broadsheet editorial columns, websites and workplace conversations. This is partly because the series has a compelling concept, but mainly because - through the use of the live web transmission - Big Brother is the first TV show to make serious use of the new viewing possibilities. Another significance of yesterday's scenes was that viewers were for almost the first time watching genuinely unedited events: no presenter or director was mediating the coverage. By the time Nick's departure is seen in conventional form - on Friday's edition of Big Brother - it will seem second-hand to many viewers. This is a remarkable change in the nature of what it means to watch TV. The only drawback to this up-rooting of the couch potato is the one which has always afflicted the internet. Nick's ostracisation could have marked the coming of age of internet broadcasting, but in the event, this was not the case. Like an impotent bridegroom, the worldwide web is always let down at the potentially sweetest moments by the equipment. The infuriating message \"web congestion\" - which will be familiar to those who tried to download either the Starr report or the Louise Woodward judgment - frequently interrupted coverage as the internet again failed to meet demand. This provided a second irony for historians of television in yesterday's office huddles. The second most common prediction about the future of television - apart from the one that shared viewing would no longer occur - was perfection of the image. Widescreen and digital TV were expected to allow programming of absolute clarity. Indeed, I remember writing a few years ago in a television column that the future of the medium was immaculate images watched by smaller and smaller individual audiences. Disproving one half of this bet by becoming talking-point TV, Big Brother - in its web-cam manifestation at least - also knocks down the other half, because the pictures offered are equivalent in quality to the first ever experimental television sets. People huddled excitedly together around a tiny, unreliable image: in a quite unexpected way, the future of television has turned out to mirror its distant past. As for Big Brother's hold on its audience, the Nick transmissions may represent the peak. Channel 4 has consistently denied that the game is manipulated by the programme-makers in any way. But, if so, their scrupulous honesty has been rewarded by remarkable good luck. What was called for dramatically at this halfway mark of the series is something very like what happened yesterday. It is the point at which a dramatist or screenwriter would have had the group turning against one of their number. But anyone writing or directing the events would also understand that Nick - as the dramatic engine of the piece - needed to be around for the d\u00e9nouement. It is traditional to lament the prospect of Hamlet without the prince, but Hamlet without Claudius would be equally problematic as a piece of drama. Melodrama - and Big Brother is melodramatic documentary - needs a villain. The shaming of Bateman wasn't remotely equivalent in cultural significance to the shooting of Kennedy or the death of Diana, but it marks a stage in the technology of television revelation. JFK died on amateur celluloid. Diana died on live 24-hour television. Nasty Nick was nixed on the net, a day before you'll see it on a set.

      "body": "<p>Outside the chip shop, the tallest of the three girls - the one with the not-yet-broken-in shoes, gold hooped earrings and, owing to some creative use of peroxide, a vaguely badgerish appearance - is excited. \"I can't wait. He's gorgeous,\" she screams with teenage enthusiasm. \"I'd give him one.\" Her friend, in a barely decent miniskirt, is also thrilled. \"God, it'll be great. Imagine getting off with him.\" </p> <p>Prince William, second in line to the throne, must be reassured. Should he ever feel the need to tear himself away from essays on the Bauhaus's influence on cubism or symbolism in Botticelli, he will find a warm welcome waiting for him among the battered haddock, chipped potatoes and teenage acne of St Andrews. Not that he is likely to experience such low-rent pleasures. St Andrews, particularly the St Andrews encountered by those of such wealth and breeding as the almost heir apparent, is not that sort of place at all. </p> <p>The isolated and quietly dignified Fife town is famous for two things: golf and its prolificacy of public-school-educated students. Both are apparent wherever you look. On a clear day it is possible to sit on the beach and gaze on for miles as rich Japanese businessmen and Americans in plus fours happily hack their way round the Old Course, before disappearing in a blaze of flying fairway. In the tat shops in town there are practical golf-themed tea towels (\u00a31.99) and, for the golfer who desires nothing so useful, a themed paperweight (\u00a37.99). All this awaits the man who will be king. </p> <p>When the telephone rang in the jungle deep in Belize yesterday morning and Prince William's Eton housemaster, Andrew Gailey, crackled down the line the news that the young prince had done rather better in his A-levels than his parents , the prince's attentions must have turned from the Welsh Guard operations he was enduring to St Andrews. In Fife they were certainly thinking about him. The rumour broke on Wednesday - and the tabloids descended. According to yesterday's Sun, it was all undergraduate sex on the fairways and three-in-a-bunker romps at St Andrews. Social anthropology graduate Kev Head, however, told the Guardian he was unconvinced. \"It's a bit cold for that,\" he says. There is, though, plenty of nakedness for Prince William to contemplate. </p> <p>As befits a university where, reputedly, anything between 40% and 75% of undergraduates - the university does not keep figures - hail from public-school backgrounds, there is a lot of getting your kit off at St Andrews. Members of the rugby team have an annual streak down Market Street.

      "bodyText": "Outside the chip shop, the tallest of the three girls - the one with the not-yet-broken-in shoes, gold hooped earrings and, owing to some creative use of peroxide, a vaguely badgerish appearance - is excited. \"I can't wait. He's gorgeous,\" she screams with teenage enthusiasm. \"I'd give him one.\" Her friend, in a barely decent miniskirt, is also thrilled. \"God, it'll be great. Imagine getting off with him.\" Prince William, second in line to the throne, must be reassured. Should he ever feel the need to tear himself away from essays on the Bauhaus's influence on cubism or symbolism in Botticelli, he will find a warm welcome waiting for him among the battered haddock, chipped potatoes and teenage acne of St Andrews. Not that he is likely to experience such low-rent pleasures. St Andrews, particularly the St Andrews encountered by those of such wealth and breeding as the almost heir apparent, is not that sort of place at all. The isolated and quietly dignified Fife town is famous for two things: golf and its prolificacy of public-school-educated students. Both are apparent wherever you look. On a clear day it is possible to sit on the beach and gaze on for miles as rich Japanese businessmen and Americans in plus fours happily hack their way round the Old Course, before disappearing in a blaze of flying fairway. In the tat shops in town there are practical golf-themed tea towels (\u00a31.99) and, for the golfer who desires nothing so useful, a themed paperweight (\u00a37.99). All this awaits the man who will be king. When the telephone rang in the jungle deep in Belize yesterday morning and Prince William's Eton housemaster, Andrew Gailey, crackled down the line the news that the young prince had done rather better in his A-levels than his parents , the prince's attentions must have turned from the Welsh Guard operations he was enduring to St Andrews. In Fife they were certainly thinking about him. The rumour broke on Wednesday - and the tabloids descended. According to yesterday's Sun, it was all undergraduate sex on the fairways and three-in-a-bunker romps at St Andrews. Social anthropology graduate Kev Head, however, told the Guardian he was unconvinced. \"It's a bit cold for that,\" he says. There is, though, plenty of nakedness for Prince William to contemplate. As befits a university where, reputedly, anything between 40% and 75% of undergraduates - the university does not keep figures - hail from public-school backgrounds, there is a lot of getting your kit off at St Andrews. Members of the rugby team have an annual streak down Market Street. There's also the Kate Kennedy club, founded in 1926, whose nine male members, in between dressing up in women's clothing, commemorate Bishop Kennedy's apparently fetching niece by taking their clothes off and larking about in the - somewhat chilly - North Sea. Yesterday, though, there was none of that. It was all terribly serious.

Last night 192,140 candidates across the country had confirmed their places at university. \u0095 Advice on clearing and university entrance at www.clearing2000.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There was an unpleasant note of alarm in the coverage following yesterday's news that girls have done better than boys in this year's A-levels, but it was, perhaps, mitigated by the fact that this has been a spectacularly bad month for British lads. For any 16-year-old boy in the delicate throes of finding an image for himself, the undernourished, over-sensitive, suicidal and now academically malfunctioning picture of British masculinity may leave him wishing he had been born female. </p> <p>The A-level bombshell has compounded a run of eight years during which girls have gained more overall passes than boys; and for the first time, girls have achieved more A grades. It follows the publication of statistics revealing that men between the ages of 15-24 are three times more likely to commit suicide than women of the same age. </p> <p>To add to the gloom, Mary-Catherine Lader, the 15-year-old daughter of the US ambassador to Britain, chose this month to publicly ridicule British boys as \"pale and unhealthy looking\", and a good deal less sophisticated than their American counterparts. </p> <p>The most irksome of the theories on why girls have overtaken boys at A-level, and in life generally, is that whenever girls do well in a given field, that field is instantly discredited in the eyes of boys. The \"feminisation\" of education, in other words the fact that girls are allowed to do well now rather than being held back, is thought by experts to be one of the chief reasons boys don't concentrate in the classroom. </p> <p>\"Keeping them engaged is the challenge of this century,\" says Adrienne Katz, head of the charity Young Voice which last year interviewed 1,400 male teenagers aged 13-19 in a joint study with Oxford University. The results found that 17% of the boys were anti-school enough not to pass a single exam. \"You will get some boys saying, 'Well, education is a girl's thing, why should we be teased to death for trying hard?' More boys are bullied for being good at their school work than for being thick.\" </p> <p>\"Girls still haven't reached equality,\" says Dr Ann Buchanan, who is joint author of the Leading Lads report and a university reader at Oxford. \"But whereas the boys might have felt that they had a fairly easy playing field in the past, they are having to compete with the girls now.\" </p> <p>It is competition corrupted by the lingering belief that a boy who comes second to a girl has not only lost the race, but something much more profound; something that involves his gender and his dignity as a man. With stakes so high, many boys would rather drop out of the game altogether than risk trying and failing. The result is that more boys than girls leave school without qualifications, more are liable to play truant, more are excluded and more end up in remedial groups. </p> <p>The knock-on effects, only loosely related, are that more men than women are unemployed, more are likely to be made redundant and more become drug addicts. \"Our research showed that this type of news about girls' A-level success can make boys go, 'Well, if girls do so much better then why should we bother to try?'\" says Katz. </p> <p>The expectation that girls should, by their very natures, do considerably less well than boys, is still taken seriously if the fact of them \"over-achieving\" is seen to have such a deep impact on boys' self-esteem, so deep in fact, that it sends them spinning off into unemployment, depression and probable suicide. It is compounded by that old chestnut, the dearth of good male role models, a subject around which a mini-boom in publishing has been flourishing for some years. </p> <p>Last year, Susan Faludi followed up her hugely successful tome, Backlash, with Stiffed, a six-year study of American men which explored the now infamous catchphrase, \"the crisis in masculinity\". This was variously interpreted as an intellectual cover for men fighting to retain their privilege, and a genuine phenomenon causing under-achievement in boys. </p> <p>Faludi tended towards the latter, concluding that men have been disoriented by the systematic discrediting of values on which they were brought up, namely that if they abided by certain codes of behaviour their dominance at home and in the world would be assured. It is this disorientation that Andrew Samuels, professor of analytical psychology at Essex University, has examined closely. \"If men turned away from softness, play, emotional connection, all the so-called feminine attributes society would reward the traditional man, if not with material wealth and political prominence, then at least with dominion over wife and children. Men did all that, but the reward didn't come,\" he says. </p> <p>This, the argument goes, has left men and boys in a literal no-man's land, gasping to find an identity for themselves. \"Boys are finding that the old ways of doing things don't work,\" says Samuels. \"And perhaps they have yet to find any new ways.\" </p> <p>The result in schools, is that boys are more likely to seek prestige not overtly by excelling before the teacher, since the values prescribing overt prestige are in a state of flux, but covertly, by performing wildly before their peers. \"As girls do more and more tough things, travel the world, climb mountains, you have to be more and more of a butch male to distinguish yourself,\" says Katz. \"If you aren't doing well in class, you get admiration for playing about because people think of you as a bit of a hero. You become a mega-male.\" </p> <p>Buchanan is currently researching bullying. \"The bullies and the bullied are often very similar people, rather lacking in confidence. It may be that the boy bullies get their confidence from behaving the way that they do because they feel that they are losing their power.\" </p> <p>None of which should be read as evidence that boys are somehow the new victims. Their \"plight\" is thrown into definition only because girls have made such progress in the past 10 years that the boys appear to be failing badly, when in fact they are simply staying still. \"You have to look at the distribution of power and resources in the world as a whole before you start portraying boys as victims,\" says Samuels. \"This can't be read as a great victory for women.\" </p> <p>In fact, three years after A-levels, as recent research shows, men gain more firsts at university than women. And who needs reminding of the pitiful number of women at senior management level in every industry? Perhaps this is why, when boys equate reading as something they do with their mummies and football as something they do with their daddies, reading suddenly becomes a waste of time. If it was important, after all, surely daddy handle it? So it continues. At the end of one of the most important weeks of their lives, there will be lots of girls clutching their A-grade A-levels wondering why all the attention is still focused on the boys. </p> <p><strong>On the streets of London:<br> the views of three 16-year- olds</strong><br>Interviews by Merope Mills </p> <p> <strong>Scott Bland</strong></p> <p> \"You don't need any qualifications these days.

Amid a galaxy of stunning A-level performances, with five A grades almost - but not quite - becoming commonplace, no one shone more brightly than Thomas. Neither the Department for Education and Employment, the exam boards nor the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority keeps records of individual achievements, but no one can remember anything this impressive before. Certainly not Thomas's headmaster, Tristram Jones-Parry, who has taught at the school for 27 years and been in charge for two. \"I've never known anything like this,\" he said. Thomas leaves Westminster school with A grades at A-level in chemistry, economics, electronics, history, maths, pure maths, mechanics, statistics, and physics. He also has an A in AS-level philosophy, and scholarship level in two Cambridge University Step papers, maths 2 and maths 3. Three of the A-levels were taken last year. \"He's an extraordinary guy in the sense that he bears his brilliance easily,\" said Mr Jones-Parry. \"He's an extremely good debater, a very good singer. He's inspired other people.\" Visiting lecturers often had the experience of reconsidering their view after taking a question from Thomas. Thomas, who is to read maths at Cambridge, moved to Westminster for the sixth form on a scholarship from Culford independent school in Bury St Edmunds. In greater Manchester, a Ukrainian boy who spoke barely any English when he came to live in the UK five years ago was yesterday celebrating having gained six A-levels at grade A. Pavel Zubko will take up a place at Cambridge to read natural sciences this autumn, after notching up top passes this year in biology, chemistry, physics, further maths and general studies while a pupil at Sale grammar school. They are on top of an existing A in A-level maths, which he took two years ago. Yesterday 18-year-old Pavel paid tribute to the teachers at his school. \"I had loads of help from all my teachers and I could not have done it without them,\" he said. He and his family came to Britain from Kiev in the summer of 1995 when his father took up a research post at Manchester University. After a year at another school, where he gained grade A* at GCSE in maths and grade A in German, he started at Sale grammar school. Initially Pavel encountered language difficulties, the school said, but he proved himself to be an extremely able student, excelling in mathematics. While studying nine other subjects to GCSE, he largely taught himself A-level maths, with relatively little assistance from staff. Yesterday the school's deputy head, Dave Wilson, said Pavel was \"a thoroughly delightful young man whose unassuming nature has won him many friends among the staff and students at the school. \"He has willingly given up his time to help younger pupils with any problems they have experienced in mathematics and has in effect acted as an additional member of staff the school's mathematics faculty.\" Mr Wilson said his pupil's achievement in general studies was a particularly impressive result given that the exam tests the level of general knowledge expected in a typical 18-year-old who has been resident in the UK since birth. Yesterday morning Pavel had not been able to pass on the good news to his mother, who was in Ukraine, but was looking forward to celebrating in the evening with a few friends. Eventually he would like to follow in the footsteps of his family by becoming a scientist.",

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles yesterday sent an email of congratulations to Prince William, currently on exercise with the Welsh Guards in the jungles of Belize, after his eldest son was awarded A, B and C grades in his A-levels - good enough to secure his place at St Andrews University. The prince, who left Eton last month, was awarded the A for geography, B for history of art and C for biology. The results were conveyed to him by his former housemaster and St Andrews graduate, Andrew Gailey. After taking a gap year, to be spent partly in Australia, the prince is expected to become the first member of the royal family to study at a Scottish university. He will go up in the autumn of 2001, reading for a four year history of art honours degree. The entry requirements are normally two Bs and a C. For a young man whose family have Rembrandts, Vermeers, Canalettos and Van Dycks hanging on the walls at home, course work and vacation studies should not pose a problem. The course, described in the university's prospectus as visually stimulating and intellectually challenging, is unlikely to be damned by the chief education inspector as vacuous. Prince Charles said: \"I know how hard William worked to achieve these excellent results and I am very proud that he has done so well.\" In a statement from St James's Palace, the prince was said to be \"obviously delighted and relieved that he has got into St Andrews\" and very much looking forward to becoming a student there. His grades - added to 10 GCSEs, eight of them As and two Bs, two years ago - appear to be the best achieved by a member of the royal family since they submitted to public examinations 33 years ago when Prince Charles obtained a C in French and a B in history in his A-levels. The choice of St Andrews, as opposed to Cambridge which members of the royal family have traditionally attended for the past 150 years, was apparently Prince William's own. Edinburgh and Bristol were also considered. Both his father and uncle Edward read history at Cambridge and both faced accusations of favouritism from contemporaries, something that William should not have to face. The choice of the oldest Scottish university will certainly ease palace security headaches, situated as it is in a small and intimate coastal town remote from the metropolis. It is also far away from the normal beat of paparazzi and the nearest nightclub is in Dundee. About 60% of its intake is from state schools. It may be the first time the prince will have met state school contemporaries. A spokesman for the university said St Andrews would provide a \"unique, nourishing and challenging environment\" for Prince William. \"We are pleased for him as we are for all successful applicants and look forward to welcoming him to our community,\" he said. Alex Salmond, outgoing leader of the Scottish National party and a St Andrews graduate, said the prince would assist the university's international reputation and it was a sensible choice for him to have made. But he added: \"The university will have to reinforce its efforts to make sure Scotland's oldest university is seen as a people's university, not just for the privileged.\" How other royals fared: Prince William has proved himself to be one of the brightest members of the modern royal family, his three good A-levels coming after three A*s, five As and two Bs at GCSE two years ago. His father, the Prince of Wales, who was the first member of the royal family to sit public examinations, got two A-levels - a B in history and a C in french - after passing five O-Levels (he failed maths). But he had no say in his choice of university. A committee including Harold Wilson, the prime minister, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Dean of Windsor, the chairman of the committee of university vice-chancellors and Lord Mountbatten chose Cambridge for him, where he got a 2:2. Prince William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, did not take any A-levels and once told a 15-year-old boy that she could not answer a Trivial Pursuit question because she was as thick as a plank. The Princess Royal obtained an E in geography and D in history in her A-levels in 1968 but she did not go to university. The Duke of York gained three A-levels in 1979 - in history, english and economics and political science - and in 1982 the Earl of Wessex received two - in english literature and economics and political science, plus an S-Level in history. Buckingham Palace refused to divulge grades attained by princes Andrew and Edward yesterday, saying \"the examinations were harder then and the marking different\". Other A level highlights: \u0095Adam Spencer, 10, from Arlesey in Bedfordshire, is likely to be the youngest A-level success. He achieved a grade B in maths after taking adult education courses at Luton sixth form college. \"I was actually hoping for an A but I'm very pleased with a B,\" he said. He intends to go to university at 14 to read maths. Brian Edwards, deputy principal of the college, said they had accepted Adam after other schools refused to take him because of his age. \u0095Sameer Sanghvi, 12, from Finchley, north London, got a grade C in computing from Ryde College, Watford. \u0095Terry Tyacke, 74, extended his world record by passing his 27th A-level exam, scoring an A grade in film studies. He left school at 15 with no qualifications and took his first exam aged 46, to encourage his daughter. \"I can't stop, it's like a drug and I am addicted,\" said Mr Tyacke, of Trowbridge, Wilts. \u0095Tamara Todorovic, a refugee from Bosnia who could not speak English when she arrived in Britain with her family in 1993, has gained three As at A-level. She is leaving Bishop Stopford school in Kettering, Northants, for Warwick University. \u0095German Michael Tyka went to Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, in September 1998, supposedly for a term to brush up his English, but decided to stay on and won 6 A grades at A-level, in maths, biology, chemistry, physics, general studies and German. He will read biochemistry at Imperial college, London. \u0095At Conyers school, a comprehensive in Stockton on Tees, Alan Elder made it into his exam board's top five performers in both maths and further maths. He is going to Cambridge University to read engineering. \u0095Christopher Cummins of Our Lady Sion School in Worthing, Sussex, achieved five grade As at A-level, which he sat when aged 16. His passes were in maths with statistics, pure maths, mechanics, chemistry and physics. He also gained grade 1 in two Cambridge Step papers.

      "bodyText": "The Monica Lewinsky scandal returned to haunt the Democratic party last night as news of fresh legal moves against Bill Clinton threatened to overshadow Al Gore's presidential nomination acceptance speech at the party convention in Los Angeles. A leak, which the White House claimed was far from coincidental, revealed that the independent counsel, Robert Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr in the job earlier this year, had empanelled a grand jury in Washington to consider prosecuting Mr Clinton when he leaves office in January. The source said the grand jury had been sitting since July 11 for the sole purpose of considering charges against Mr Clinton arising out of his relationship with Ms Lewinsky and attempts to cover it up. When Mr Clinton becomes an ordinary citizen on January 20 2001, he may face criminal charges similar to those on which he was impeached and acquitted by Congress last year. Mr Clinton faced two charges from the Senate, of perjury and obstruction of justice. Neither charge reached the required two-thirds majority for conviction. The White House reacted angrily to the news, which was leaked to the Associated Press news agency and emerged just hours before the vice-president addressed the convention in a speech widely billed as an attempt to break free from the shadow of Mr Clinton. \"The timing of this leak reeks to high heaven,\" the White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. \"Given the record of the office of the independent counsel, the timing is hardly surprising.\" Mr Gore's spokesman Chris Lehane said: \"Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are going to focus on America's future. Republicans are obsessed with the past.\" Even George W Bush's aides criticised the leak. \"It's not appropriate for this type of announcement to be made on the day that the vice-president is going to accept the Democ ratic nomination,\" spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. In his speech early today, Mr Gore promised a \"better, fairer, more prosperous America\". \"I stand here tonight as my own man,\" he said after eight years as vice-president. \"I want you to know this,\" he told an expectant audience. \"I've taken on the powerful forces. As president, I'll stand up to them, and I'll stand up for you.\" With Mr Clinton nearly 3,000 miles away in the east, Mr Gore left no ploy unused in an effort to persuade US voters to do the one thing they stubbornly refuse to do: to learn to love him the way they continue - in spite of everything - to love Mr Clinton. Mr Gore's acceptance speech followed days of relentless effort to portray the vice-president as the kind of personality who can fire the anxious party's troubled soul. Friends and relatives bore witness to the vice-president as a warm, honest, brave and relaxed family man and national leader, setting the scene for a speech which was widely seen as the make-or-break moment in Mr Gore's efforts to prevent Mr Bush from capturing the White House. Tributes from his wife Tipper and his daughters Karenna and Kristin were interwoven with testimony from figures such as the actor Tommy Lee Jones and the writer David Halberstam, all of them seeking to humanise Mr Gore's defiantly stiff reputation and energise a party which is unmistakably underwhelmed about its chances in November. Mr Gore and his spin doctors insisted that he wrote most of his speech himself, in an effort to communicate as directly as possible with the party and the nation. \"This is a speech that I have written, and I will deserve either the credit or the blame,\" Mr Gore had said shortly after arriving in Los Angeles on Wednesday.",

They have known each other since they studied together at Cambridge. </p> <p> <strong> Anna </strong> </p> <p> I always look at people's legs - I think I have rugby player's legs but Lorrie has dancer's legs. I know she is heavier at the moment than she wants to be but her personality is loud and exuberant, and whatever body she had would reflect that. She doesn't let her weight hamper her. Fat is not about having extra weight, anyway, it's a frame of mind. And if you're comfortable with your own body, you'll be comfortable with another woman's body by extension. </p> <p> <strong> Lorrie </strong> </p> <p> Anna always looks fantastic, like a 40s film star. She has an amazing back and great arms but we don't really discuss our bodies. If we're going out, we'll compliment each other's hair or clothes instead. I knew Anna when she was larger than she is now and she was always a very attractive personality. I'm 13 stone and to me I look fat: nothing sags yet but it's all getting wider. Even when I was a gymnast and under nine stone, I still thought I was fat. </p> <p><strong> Sarah Klugman and Anyanna Ndukwe </strong><br> </p> <p> Best friends Sarah, 29, a project development manager, and Anyanna, 36, a freelance journalist and mother of two, met as mature students. </p> <p> <strong> Sarah</strong> </p> <p> I first saw Anyanna's body properly when I stayed at her house and she was walking around in a vest. She's very muscular - she can lift a child in each hand. After two kids, she has a good tum and I think she likes her body. I've always had a love-hate relationship with mine. From when I was 18, I felt it wasn't doing what it ought to and for years I tried to control it. I need to do more exercise but avoid it because I feel I ought to be happy with my body as it is. </p> <p> <strong> Anyanna </strong> </p> <p> Sarah has a strong body with a sense of power. Her posture is good; there's a feeling of balance in her and I like her long legs. I've always been slim but I was most happy with my body when I was dancing because I was eating and exercising more. I find it odd that women put on weight when they have kids - motherhood has made me leaner because I'm so busy! But a breast uplift is something I might consider in the future because breastfeeding has taken its toll. </p> <p><strong> Jessica Shepstone and Shelley Sanger</strong><br> </p> <p> Jessica, 26, is a gossip columnist for an internet site and Shelley, 28, is an illustrator. They have been best friends for six years. </p> <p> <strong> Jessica </strong> </p> <p> I envy the fact that Shelley is smaller-boned than me because while I'm not fat, I'm voluptuous. And when Shelley diets she becomes quite skinny whereas I look just the same. I love Shelley's lips and she's got a cute little nose. I tell her if something she's wearing doesn't suit her but I'm not being nasty - I just want her to look her best. We feel comfortable with each other's bodies. We're used to being naked together, it's not a problem for us. </p> <p> <strong> Shelley </strong> </p> <p> Jessica's got a lovely body and nice pert bosoms, not droopy like mine. I was a 38B when I was a teenager because I had so much puppy fat but then it just fell off. It took me a while to realise I wasn't plump any more. Men think Jessica is quite sexy - I think that's because she's so comfortable with her body and men like that. I feel much more confident about my body now than I used to and in fact our friendship has helped that. It's quite sisterly. </p> <p><strong> Seth Greenhill and Simon Greenhill</strong><br> </p> <p> Brothers Seth, 30, a telesales consultant, and Simon, 35, a professional drummer, are the two halves of funk band the Bird Tribe. </p> <p> <strong> Seth </strong> </p> <p> We've got very similar looks and they reflect who we are as people: Simon is the taller older brother, I'm the slightly shorter younger brother. I could be a bit better built - when I was younger I had a body that could be blown away by the wind. I'd maybe consider cutting my hair but as musicians it's a powerful image to have us looking alike. It's been said we are two sides of the same coin - the same but always looking in opposite directions, which is true. </p> <p> <strong> Simon </strong> </p> <p> I like getting older, getting lines - I like the transition from a boyish face to a more masculine one. I like the way doing yoga tones my body, too. I'm the loud one with tattoos and piercings, Seth's the more down-to-earth one - sometimes I think he looks more like his day job than the person he really is. But there are enough differences in our characters and how we put ourselves across to prevent jealousy over image. The competitive stuff comes in our music.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>BLACKBURN OWNER WALKER DIES</strong></p> <p>Jack Walker, the steel magnate who funded Blackburn's 1995 title-winning team, has died aged 71 after a long illness. </p> <p>Walker took control of the club in 1991, when Blackburn were struggling in the old Second Division, but within four years they were Premiership champions. During his first three years, Walker spent \u00a325m on new players, including the \u00a33.5m signing of Alan Shearer from Southampton. He also transformed the ageing Ewood Park ground at a cost of more than \u00a320m.</p> <p>He was very much a hands-on chairman, regularly phoning his manager and players and travelling to every Rovers game, despite being based in Jersey. \"He knew everyone right down to the bag man,\" said former Rovers defender Tony Gale after hearing the news. \"Everyone interested him and Jack was known to everyone. He transformed the place into what it is today. The town and the club owe a great debt to him.\"</p> <p>Even when Blackburn returned to the First Division, Walker's commitment to the Rovers cause did not diminish. \"You have to get pleasure out of it,\" he said. \"It has put Blackburn back on the up and shown that if you believe in things they can be done. If they don't win then I am bloody miserable on a Sunday.\"</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT: WIN \u00a310,000 AND A TRIP TO THE BRAZILIAN CUP FINAL IN RIO</strong></p> <p>Think you know about football? Prove it and win with Fantasy League, home of the original fantasy football game. http://www.fantasyleague.com</p> <p><strong>BORING, BORING BRADFORD</strong></p> <p>Big transfer news involving Bradford used to be different and exciting. But now they spend so much money, it's just tedious. Spend, spend, spend. That's all Chris Hutchings seems to do! Well, we're sick of it. There's absolutely no way we're going to report the fact that Ashley Ward has completed a \u00a31.5m transfer from Blackburn. Balls to that. Instead, let's give some space to some stuff we'd normally put in the News In Brief.</p> <p>\"Ipswich have just spent \u00a34m on Wimbledon defender Hermann Hreidarsson. The Icelandic international will go straight into the team to face Spurs tomorrow.\" Heh! Not a mention of how the 29-year-old Ward completed his medical in time before the noon registration deadline. \"Australia have confirmed that Leeds United's Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and Danny Milosevic will be in their squad for next month's Olympic Games in Sydney.\" See? We don't care that Ward is likely to play alongside Benito Carbone against Liverpool tomorrow. At all.</p> <p>\"The Wales squad to play Belarus in Minsk on September 2 in the World Cup qualifying group five is as follows: P Jones (Southampton), Freestone (Swansea), Barnard (Barnsley), G Roberts (Tranmere), Coleman, Symons, Melville (all Fulham), Page (Watford), Delaney (Aston Villa), Speed (Newcastle), Pembridge (Everton), M Jones (Leeds), Savage (Leicester), Robinson (Charlton), Giggs (Man Utd), Blake (Blackburn), Hartson (Wimbledon), Bellamy (Coventry), Saunders (Bradford), I Roberts (Norwich).\" Did you see that? There wasn't even any room for a quote from Geoffrey Richmond. Ha! Ha! Ha!</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If I am not given the same status Laurent Blanc has enjoyed in the national team over the last four years, by which I mean an automatic place in the side, I will retire. I am totally clear about it. There is absolutely no ambiguity\" - He's smooth, he's charming, he's Frank Leboeuf.</p> <p><strong>LOOK INTO OUR BALLS</strong></p> <p>This time last season, the Fiver looked into its crystal ball. Inside we found the usual wintertime scene, complete with life-like plastic snowflakes. This in some way explains why our resulting predictions were so far out. We forecast that Leeds would perform poorly (not quite), that Liverpool would take the Premiership by storm (well, almost) and that Dagenham Davor Suker would be chased out of the country by the tabloids (God only knows where we got that from). We also tipped Ruud Gullit to be the first manager out of a job, but that's by the by. Basically, the point is that while you can read this year's predictions, and maybe even enjoy them, it wouldn't be wise to put any money down. So here goes...</p> <p>THE FIRST MANAGER TO LOSE HIS JOB WILL BE... John Gregory. It's a shocker, we know, but there's nothing we can do about it. You see, once Villa lose their opening three games to Leicester, Chelsea and Liverpool, Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu will insist on playing crab football for the remainder of the season. Luc Nilis will retire through injury and Greg's 15 defensive midfielders will end up killing each other in a fight to make the first team. By this point Darling Doug Ellis will have no choice but wait another few months and then sack him.</p> <p>THE SURPRISE HIT OF THE YEAR WILL BE... Tottenham Hotspur. They rely too much on the performance of one man. The fans aren't totally behind the manager. The defence is almost totally populated by ex-Wimbledon players. Steffan Freund prowls the midfield. All in all, from where we're standing, it's not looking good. Fifth place, then.</p> <p>THE SURPRISE FLOP OF THE YEAR WILL BE... Manchester United. Oh go on. Please.</p> <p>THE FIRST FOREIGNER TO INCUR TABLOID WRATH (WHO IS NOT FRANK LEBOEUF) WILL BE... Linda Evangelista.

      "bodyText": "BLACKBURN OWNER WALKER DIES Jack Walker, the steel magnate who funded Blackburn's 1995 title-winning team, has died aged 71 after a long illness. Walker took control of the club in 1991, when Blackburn were struggling in the old Second Division, but within four years they were Premiership champions. During his first three years, Walker spent \u00a325m on new players, including the \u00a33.5m signing of Alan Shearer from Southampton. He also transformed the ageing Ewood Park ground at a cost of more than \u00a320m. He was very much a hands-on chairman, regularly phoning his manager and players and travelling to every Rovers game, despite being based in Jersey. \"He knew everyone right down to the bag man,\" said former Rovers defender Tony Gale after hearing the news. \"Everyone interested him and Jack was known to everyone. He transformed the place into what it is today. The town and the club owe a great debt to him.\" Even when Blackburn returned to the First Division, Walker's commitment to the Rovers cause did not diminish. \"You have to get pleasure out of it,\" he said. \"It has put Blackburn back on the up and shown that if you believe in things they can be done. If they don't win then I am bloody miserable on a Sunday.\" ADVERTISEMENT: WIN \u00a310,000 AND A TRIP TO THE BRAZILIAN CUP FINAL IN RIO Think you know about football? Prove it and win with Fantasy League, home of the original fantasy football game. http://www.fantasyleague.com BORING, BORING BRADFORD Big transfer news involving Bradford used to be different and exciting. But now they spend so much money, it's just tedious. Spend, spend, spend. That's all Chris Hutchings seems to do! Well, we're sick of it. There's absolutely no way we're going to report the fact that Ashley Ward has completed a \u00a31.5m transfer from Blackburn. Balls to that. Instead, let's give some space to some stuff we'd normally put in the News In Brief. \"Ipswich have just spent \u00a34m on Wimbledon defender Hermann Hreidarsson. The Icelandic international will go straight into the team to face Spurs tomorrow.\" Heh! Not a mention of how the 29-year-old Ward completed his medical in time before the noon registration deadline. \"Australia have confirmed that Leeds United's Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka and Danny Milosevic will be in their squad for next month's Olympic Games in Sydney.\" See? We don't care that Ward is likely to play alongside Benito Carbone against Liverpool tomorrow. At all. \"The Wales squad to play Belarus in Minsk on September 2 in the World Cup qualifying group five is as follows: P Jones (Southampton), Freestone (Swansea), Barnard (Barnsley), G Roberts (Tranmere), Coleman, Symons, Melville (all Fulham), Page (Watford), Delaney (Aston Villa), Speed (Newcastle), Pembridge (Everton), M Jones (Leeds), Savage (Leicester), Robinson (Charlton), Giggs (Man Utd), Blake (Blackburn), Hartson (Wimbledon), Bellamy (Coventry), Saunders (Bradford), I Roberts (Norwich).\" Did you see that? There wasn't even any room for a quote from Geoffrey Richmond. Ha! Ha! Ha! QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If I am not given the same status Laurent Blanc has enjoyed in the national team over the last four years, by which I mean an automatic place in the side, I will retire. I am totally clear about it. There is absolutely no ambiguity\" - He's smooth, he's charming, he's Frank Leboeuf. LOOK INTO OUR BALLS This time last season, the Fiver looked into its crystal ball. Inside we found the usual wintertime scene, complete with life-like plastic snowflakes. This in some way explains why our resulting predictions were so far out. We forecast that Leeds would perform poorly (not quite), that Liverpool would take the Premiership by storm (well, almost) and that Dagenham Davor Suker would be chased out of the country by the tabloids (God only knows where we got that from). We also tipped Ruud Gullit to be the first manager out of a job, but that's by the by. Basically, the point is that while you can read this year's predictions, and maybe even enjoy them, it wouldn't be wise to put any money down. So here goes... THE FIRST MANAGER TO LOSE HIS JOB WILL BE... John Gregory. It's a shocker, we know, but there's nothing we can do about it. You see, once Villa lose their opening three games to Leicester, Chelsea and Liverpool, Gareth Southgate and Ugo Ehiogu will insist on playing crab football for the remainder of the season. Luc Nilis will retire through injury and Greg's 15 defensive midfielders will end up killing each other in a fight to make the first team. By this point Darling Doug Ellis will have no choice but wait another few months and then sack him. THE SURPRISE HIT OF THE YEAR WILL BE... Tottenham Hotspur. They rely too much on the performance of one man. The fans aren't totally behind the manager. The defence is almost totally populated by ex-Wimbledon players. Steffan Freund prowls the midfield. All in all, from where we're standing, it's not looking good. Fifth place, then. THE SURPRISE FLOP OF THE YEAR WILL BE... Manchester United. Oh go on. Please. THE FIRST FOREIGNER TO INCUR TABLOID WRATH (WHO IS NOT FRANK LEBOEUF) WILL BE... Linda Evangelista. This will happen the minute Fabien Barthez has a bad game, as some fat old hack plays cherchez la femme. (cf. Victoria Beckham and hubby) THE NEW CRAZE WILL BE... Hoping one of the minnows get relegated. Why pretend to like the small clubs? Pick one team from Ipswich, Bradford or Charlton and guffaw loudly as, during the first couple of weeks of the season, they nick a 1-0 win at Anfield or Stamford Bridge. Then get mightily irritated as the goal is repeated every single time they're featured on Football Focus. Laugh like a drain when they get relegated unluckily on the last minute of the last day of the season - you'll never have to see that shoddy goalmouth scramble again! THE RUMOUR MILL Henning Berg has expressed an interest in moving to Celtic from Manchester United. \"Officially, I haven't heard of any contact by Celtic but there might have been while I've been away [with Norway on international duty],\" Berg said. \"Celtic are a massive club and I think most players would be interested.\" Blackburn are leading the \u00a31m chase for Maccabi Haifa defender Arik Benado. NEWS IN BRIEF John Beresford, the Southampton defender, has been forced to quit the game after failing to recover from a serious knee injury. \"It's just one of those things that happen in football,\" said a philosophical Beresford. \"It's a weird feeling knowing I will never play again, but I cannot complain as I have had a good career.\" TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 3: First Division Football - Live: Birmingham v Fulham (7pm) Grrr!

      "bodyText": "It has been billed as the mouth versus the magnate. Reverend Al Sharpton, one of America's most vocal black leaders, is on a collision course with media mogul Rupert Murdoch after the businessman swooped on a television network. Mr Sharpton believes that the deal, a $5.4bn (\u00a33.6bn) bid for Chris-Craft, would concentrate too much power in Mr Murdoch's hands especially in Mr Sharpton's stomping ground of New York, where the group would own two television stations as well as the New York Post, the daily tabloid newspaper. Mr Sharpton said he was confident of stopping News Corporation from exerting \"undue and undemocratic political influence\" in the United States. If it succeeds in the proposed bid for Chris-Craft, News Corp would own 32 television stations in America, making it one of the largest owners in the country. In New York, no single company should own both a television station and a newspaper in any single market. News Corp won a regulatory waiver when it bought the Post in 1993 because the paper was almost bankrupt. The company has suggested it expects this waiver to be extended. The black activist leader of the National Action Network called for a meeting with the Federal Communications Commission in Washington this week. He said the regulator should take the opportunity to encourage the non-existent black ownership in New York and Salt Lake City. \"They should use this to work towards their goal of minority ownership.\" The FCC declined to comment on the merger yesterday as the deal has not yet been submitted to its offices. The acquisition is expected to provide the first real test of a rule introduced last year to allow duopolies to exist under certain market conditions.",

The spectacular epic, set during the brutal Japanese occupation of northern China during the second world war, won the Grand Prix at Cannes in May. It was shown without the permission of the Chinese authorities. Jiang, a hugely powerful star in mainland China, was reportedly banned from making films for seven years last month but had tried to ignore the sanction, as he had a previous one for acting in Zhang Yimou's Red Sorghum. But with shooting due to begin on his new film, The Story of Xu San-Guan the Blood Seller, about a man who sells his blood to survive, it appears that Jiang has been forced to compromise. Wouter Barendrecht, his European representative, said Jiang was now cutting Devils on the Doorstep. \"He has informed us that his new version with be approximately 23 minutes shorter. Unfortunately he is behind schedule due to the sensitive nature of the discussions the producers have been having with the Chinese government.\" The statement, released yesterday, is in stark contrast to his defiance of the authorities during Cannes and his fighting talking only weeks ago when he said: \"The film shows that people must express their feelings frankly and openly, instead of bottling them up inside while smiling and nodding.\" China has been opening up its cinemas to foreign films, with Hollywood's summer blockbusters, The Patriot and The Perfect Storm, showing there this month. Many observers believe Jiang has been a victim of bureaucrats whose role has been diminished by the new openness. Their chief objections to the film are that the Japanese are shown to be too powerful and that \"turtle fucker\" - a Chinese term of abuse - is over-used. A spokeswoman for the Edinburgh film festival expressed disappointment at the news but was reluctant to comment fearing it would make Jiang's situation more difficult.

While Owen has spent the last couple of seasons failing to live up to his billing, Pahars is quietly terrorising Premiership defences with his searing pace and level-headed finishing. His strike partner Kevin Davies will start chipping in as well. A few solid displays in the second half of last season silenced the bellows of laughter generated by the powerful forward's disastrous spell at Ewood Park, and his early promise could be realised this season. With Uwe Rosler, Hassan Kachloul and Stuart Ripley also up for selection - Patrice Tano, billed as the new Vieira, is one for the future - Hoddle should preside over a solid campaign. If only they had a genius supersub to rely upon when things don't go well... In: Mark Draper (Aston Villa, \u00a31.5m), Uwe Rosler (Borussia Berlin, free), Patrice Tano (Monaco, free).

Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, the head of a government commission that reviewed the rescue effort on Thursday, said there was a \"terrifying hole on the starboard side of the submarine. \"A rather big part of the crew was in the part of the boat that was hit by the catastrophe that developed at lightning speed,\" Klebanov told reporters in Murmansk, home of the Russian Northern Fleet. \"There have been no sounds for quite a long time; from within the Kursk,\" he added. Both Klebanov and the Navy commander, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, have said that any survivors were expected to run out of oxygen today, but other high-ranking naval officers have given them until next week.

Dreyfuss's response to Lieberman's point that there was too much sex and violence in Hollywood films hardly helped his case: \"If anyone was talking about legislating something and restricting Hollywood, I would probably reach for my nearest Colt 45,\" he retorted.</p> <p>\u0095 After the huge success in the US of The X-Men (released here today), another comic book is set to get some of that big screen magic, according to <a href=\"http://www.variety.com\">Variety</a>. Rising Stars is the story of a group of people who assume special powers when a fireball hits their town. MGM have bought the rights for an estimated $1m and original creator J Michael Straczynski is expected to write the script for the film. Talking about the comic he said, \"what I tried to do with this story was take all the cliches of comic books and turn them on their heads.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The surprise US success of the summer - the spoof horror film Scary Movie (released here September 8) - already has a sequel lined up which is to go into production this autumn, according to <a href=\" http://www.chud.com/ \">CHUD website</a>.

Entitled Five Seconds to Spare, the film stars Max Beesley, Ray Winstone and Sean Pertwee The 60-year-old broadcaster said of his role: \"I play a grumpy old man who spends his whole life filing records. How on earth they thought of me, I don't know.\" The film is due for release later this year. \u0095 Richard Dreyfuss has hit back at vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman's claim that legal restrictions should be placed on Hollywood because it is a corrupting influence on US citizens. Dreyfuss's response to Lieberman's point that there was too much sex and violence in Hollywood films hardly helped his case: \"If anyone was talking about legislating something and restricting Hollywood, I would probably reach for my nearest Colt 45,\" he retorted. \u0095 After the huge success in the US of The X-Men (released here today), another comic book is set to get some of that big screen magic, according to Variety. Rising Stars is the story of a group of people who assume special powers when a fireball hits their town. MGM have bought the rights for an estimated $1m and original creator J Michael Straczynski is expected to write the script for the film. Talking about the comic he said, \"what I tried to do with this story was take all the cliches of comic books and turn them on their heads.\" \u0095 The surprise US success of the summer - the spoof horror film Scary Movie (released here September 8) - already has a sequel lined up which is to go into production this autumn, according to CHUD website. The hit parody made over $144m domestically - more than seven times its budget of $7m - making it Miramax's highest grossing film ever. The sequel is scheduled to be released in America in May 2001.",

The new football-style system allowing counties to loan players to one another has quite failed to catch the imagination.

The idea was that, particularly in the last six or seven weeks of the season, promising players languishing in county second XIs would be given opportunities to sharpen their game in somebody else's first team - maybe that of a club stricken with a run of injuries. \"We were very supportive,\" says a senior official of the Professional Cricketers' Association. \"Previously, a young player could fall out of favour halfway through the season - and his season was effectively over.\"</p> <p>The new system came with appropriate strings attached: only in exceptional circumstances would players aged 25 or over be allowed to turn out for a rival county; and no player on loan would be allowed to play in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup or NatWest Trophy if he had already represented his original county in that particular competition.</p> <p>Loans could also have provided a lifeline for some struggling senior players. Mark Lathwell's precipitous decline from England opener in 1993 to Somerset seconds might have been arrested by a spell with another county; and Lancashire's third spinner, Gary Yates, also enduring the frustration of 2nd XI cricket, might have benefited from a temporary change of county too. Lancashire might also have moved to fill gaps in its one-day seam attack, while Yorkshire might have borrowed a proper spinner.</p> <p>So what happened? Well, there were some near misses. Kent, having lost strike bowlers Dean Headley and Julian Thompson for the entire season, approached a number of other counties for replacements as far back as May. And Northamptonshire, who refused to loan them Malcolm, failed to persuade anyone to part with an allrounder to replace the injured Kevin Innes.

Paolo di Canio has invigorated West Ham and with Davor Suker alongside him their attack should prosper this time. Harry Redknapp's side ought to win enough of its games to stay in the top half of the Premier League table although a porous defence may again be a burden. In: Davor Suker (Arsenal, free), Nigel Winterburn (Arsenal, undisclosed), Frederic Kanoute (Olympiques Lyonnais, \u00a34m), Hayden Fox (Sanfrecce Hiroshima, free). Out: Paulo Wanchope (Manchester City, \u00a33.65m), Neil Ruddock (Crystal Palace, free), Manny Omoyinmi (Oxford, free), Marc-Vivien Foe (Olympique Lyonnais, \u00a36m), Ian Feuer (Wimbledon, free), Stephen Purches (Bournemouth, free), Samassi Abou (released) Odds to win title: 150-1 To be relegated: 10-1 10 SUNDERLAND Position last season: 7th. Sunderland made a big impact on the Premiership League last season after winning promotion and with Don Hutchison in his midfield Peter Reid will seek to build on the confidence this engendered. But opposing defences will be more wary of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn this time and if the partnership is less prolific results may suffer. Nevertheless Sunderland should be secure for a while yet. Summer transfers In: Don Hutchison (Everton, \u00a32.5m), Tom Peeters (Mechelen, \u00a3250,000), John Kennedy (Worksop, \u00a380,000), Jurgen Macho (FC Vienna, free), Julio Arca (Argentinos, \u00a33.5m), Stanislav Varga (Slovan Bratislava, \u00a3650,000). Out: Allan Johnston (Rangers, free), Sam Ainston (Shrewsbury, free), David Duke (Swindon, free), Gerry Harrison (released), Gregg Shannon (released). Odds to win title: 150-1 To be relegated: 10-1 11 MIDDLESBROUGH Position last season: 12th. Christian Karembeu for Paul Gascoigne looks a much better swap now than it would have done a few years back and Bryan Robson will hope to capitalise on the improvement in results he achieved during the latter part of last season. Again the experience of Paul Ince will be crucial and with greater consistency fore and aft Boro should jog along nicely this time. In: Christian Karembeu (Real Madrid, \u00a32.1m), Paul Okon (Fiorentina, free), Noel Whelan (Coventry, \u00a32m), Joseph-Desire Job (Lens \u00a33m), Alen Boksic (Lazio, \u00a32m), Mark Crossley (Nottingham Forest, free). Out: Paul Gascoigne (Everton, free), Ben Roberts (Charlton, free). Odds to win title: 200-1 To be relegated: 10-1 12 SOUTHAMPTON Position last season: 15th. The arrival of Glenn Hoddle as manager arrested Southampton's decline last season and may give them a buoyant start this time around. For Hoddle the main problems will lie in improving the efficieny of a defence which still struggles to play as a unit. Kevin Davies and the Moroccans, Tahar El Khalej and Hassan Kachloul, should improve the forward momentum. In: Mark Draper (Aston Villa, \u00a31.5m), Uwe Rosler (Borussia Berlin, free), Patrice Tano (Monaco, free). Odds to win title: 150-1 To be relegated: 10-1 13 EVERTON Position last season: 13th. The partial revival achieved by Walter Smith at Goodison last season can only be endangered by the loss of John Collins, Don Hutchison and Nick Barmby from the heart of the Everton side. Unless Paul Gascoigne can keep up with the play better than he did at Middlesbrough his arrival will be an irrelevance while up front the fitness of Kevin Campbell may again be a problem. In: Duncan Ferguson (Newcastle, \u00a33.75m), Steve Watson (Aston Villa, \u00a32m), Alessandro Pistone (Newcastle, \u00a33m), Alex Nyarko (Lens, \u00a34.5m), Paul Gascoigne (Middlesbrough, free), Thomas Gravesen (SV Hamburg, \u00a32.5m), Andrew Pettinger (Scunthorpe, \u00a345,000). Out: Nick Barmby (Liverpool, \u00a36m), John Collins (Fulham, \u00a32m), Don Hutchison (Sunderland, \u00a32.5m), Mitch Ward (Barnsley, \u00a3200,000), Carl Regan (Barnsley, nominal), Dean Delaney (Port Vale, free). Odds to win title: 150-1 To be relegated: 12-1 Relegation strugglers 14 COVENTRY CITY Position last season: 14th. Selling Robbie Keane to Internazionale for \u00a313m may have been good business for Coventry but for Gordon Strachan it will make sense only if he is able to spend the money on bolstering a squad weakened by the departure of Gary McAllister to Liverpool. In: Craig Bellamy (Norwich, \u00a35m), David Thompson (Liverpool, \u00a32.5m), Jay Bothroyd (Arsenal, \u00a31m), Ivan Guerrero (Motagua, free). Out: Robbie Keane (Internazionale, \u00a313m), Noel Whelan (Middlesbrough, \u00a32m), Gary McAllister (Liverpool, released), Ian Brightwell (Walsall, free), David Burrows (Birmingham, free), Steve Ogrizovic (retired), Mark Burrows (Exeter, free), Chukkie Eribenne (Bournemouth, free). Odds to win title: 500-1 To be relegated: 9-4 15 LEICESTER CITY Position last season: 8th. Peter Taylor's potential as a Premiership League manager will surely be put to the test at Filbert Street, where he will need not only to keep the team together following the departure of Martin O'Neill but will have to reproduce some of the passion with which O'Neill invigorated an otherwise ordinary side. In: Gary Rowett (Birmingham, \u00a33m), Ade Akinbiyi (Wolves, \u00a35m), Callum Davidson (Blackburn, \u00a31.7m), Trevor Benjamin (Cambridge, \u00a31.5m), Simon Royce (Charlton, free). Out: Pegguy Arphexad (Liverpool, free), Theo Zagorakis (AEK Athens, free), John Hodges (Plymouth, free), Fernandon Pasquinelli (Boca Juniors, free), Ian Marshall (released). Odds to win title: 300-1 To be relegated: 3-1 16 MANCHESTER CITY Position last season: 2nd in First Division. George Weah will add class to City's attack but a creaking defence will be Joe Royle's biggest concern as he strives to keep them up. City may have conceded the fewest goals in the Nationwide First Division last season but they still let in 40. The signing of Alf-Inge Haaland from Leeds will help but it is going to be a tough grind all the same. In: Steve Howey (\u00a32m, Newcastle), Alf-Inge Haaland (Leeds, \u00a32.5m), George Weah (AC Milan, free), Paulo Wanchope (West Ham, \u00a33.65m). Out: Robert Taylor (Wolves, \u00a31.55m), Jamie Pollock (Crystal Palace, \u00a3600,000), Craig Russell (St Johnstone, free). Odds to win title: 300-1 To be relegated: 7-4 17 CHARLTON ATHLETIC Position last season: 1st in First Division. At least Charlton know what to expect, having bounced straight back into the Premiership after being relegated. Much will depend on how much they remember from two seasons ago, when they fell away badly after a promising start. Richard Rufus, Mark Kinsella and Andy Hunt look up to scratch,but it may still be close-run thing. In: Ben Roberts (Middlesbrough, free), Claus Jensen (Bolton, \u00a34m), Jonatan Johansson (Rangers, \u00a33.75m), Radostin Kishishev (Litets Lovech, \u00a3300,000). Out: Anthony Barness (Bolton, free), Sam Turner (Stockport, free), Keith Jones (Reading, free), Simon Royce (Leicester, free), Mark McCammon (Brentford, \u00a3100,000), Matt Holmes (retired), David Hockley (released), Kevin James (released). Odds to win title: 750-1 To be relegated: 10-11 18 DERBY COUNTY Position last season: 16th. Poor home results dragged Jim Smith's team into a relegation struggle last season and unless the performances at Pride Park improve Derby could again be in for a season of angst. Craig Burley, Georgi Kinkladze and Branko Strupar can ease some of the worries, as they did last time, but a poor start will almost certainly find Derby again struggling to survive. In: Danny Higginbotham (Man Utd, \u00a32m), Simo Valakari (Motherwell, free), Georgi Kinkladze (Ajax, \u00a33m), Bjorn Otto Bragstad (Rosenborg, \u00a31.5m), Youl Mawene (Lens, \u00a3500,000). Out: Mikkel Beck (Lille, \u00a3500,000), Esteban Fuertes (Lens, \u00a34m), Richard Knight (Oxford, free), Sinclair Le Geyt (Port Vale, free), Tony Dorigo (Stoke, free), Marc Bridge-Wilkinson (Port Vale, free), Michael Lyons (released), Danny Porter (released), Amrit Sidhu (released). Odds to win title: 750-1 To be relegated: 2-1 19 IPSWICH TOWN Position last season: 3rd in First Division. The decision of Richard Wright, England's third-choice goalkeeper, to sign a new contract has given Ipswich considerable heart but they will need a lot more to stay up. George Burley's team play neat, imaginative football and David Johnson's speed and finishing power will no doubt make an impact, but the defence looks pedestrian and Ipswich may not match the extra power of the Premiership game. In: John Scales (Tottenham, free), Martijn Reuser (Vitesse Arnhem, \u00a31m), Keith Branagan (Bolton, free). Out: Marco Holster (Go Ahead Eagles, free), Jonas Axedal (released), John Kennedy (released), Mick Stockwell (released). Odds to win title: 1000-1 To be relegated: 1-2 20 BRADFORD CITY Position last season: 17th. Bradford City's survival was arguably last season's happiest story. Football still loves the underdog. Yet Paul Jewell, who led them to safety, is now managing Sheffield Wednesday and his replacement, Chris Hutchings, who was already on the staff, will have a hard act to follow. It will be asking a lot of a side lacking so much pace to go through the whole process again. In: Ian Nolan (Sheff Wed, free), Peter Atherton (Sheff Wed, free), David Hopkin (Leeds, \u00a32.5m), Dan Petrescu (Chelsea, \u00a31m), Benito Carbone (free agent). Out: John Dreyer (Cambridge, free), Andy Patterson (released), Stephen Wright (released), Neville Southall (released). Odds to win title: 1000-1 To be relegated: 8-13",

      "body": "<p>It was the wreck-caught bit about the bass on the menu that caught my eye. Not merely line-caught or beach-caught or even rock-caught, but wreck-caught. Why, that's extra, extra special, isn't it? Isn't it? One up on diver-caught scallops, wild salmon and free-range chickens. Not that long ago, we would have been happy with a simple line-caught, diver-caught, free-range or wild. These descriptions were designed to reassure the anxious eater of the natural provenance of what was about to appear on our plate, and allay any fear for the environment that might inhibit us from tucking in with a clear conscience. </p> <p>It is a mark of the sophistication of our awareness that such reassurances should be thought necessary, and of our gullibility that we accept them, and pay the price they necessarily incur. Actually, we pay happily because it suggests that we are getting something special, something different, something better, something classier than the bloke down the road. It's as much to do with inveterate gastro-snobbery, in the unending struggle for cash and cachet, as is it with concern for ecology. </p> <p>It all began with olive oil. Once there was plain olive oil, and you were lucky if you could find that in the 50s and 60s. Then people began bringing extra virgin olive oil back with them from holidays in the Mediterranean sun, which became the benchmark for culinary class. If you were really smart then it might even be dark green and unfiltered (and uneatable). Then, in 1984/85, disaster struck Italy, the primary supplier. A savagely harsh winter gripped the country, Tuscany in particular, destroying something like a quarter of all olive trees, and reducing oil production by about a third. </p> <p>Faced with a situation in which they needed to make as much money from fewer olives, the Italians invented the regional olive oil, and then the single estate olive oil. So if you wanted to stay ahead of the game, you couldn't just rely on extra virgin olive oil any more, it had to be the extra virgin olive oil from the San Martino in Prestito estate in Tuscany in the fancy bottle at the fancy price. And you only used that for certain dishes, because its qualities made it suitable only for splashing into the frying pan or rubbing into chicken. For salads, of course, you needed the lighter Ligurian extra virgin olive oil. </p> <p>Now we are seeing two further refinements in the extra virgin olive oil story, the arrival of single varietal oils - olive oils are usually made with a blend of olives - and, naturally, of organic oils. So, look out for the organic extra virgin olive oil made from the Moraiolo olive from San Martino in Prestito. </p> <p>The progress of the olive from humble extra to main player is a template for any wannabe foodstuff. Consider the oyster. In the days of Queen Victoria, there was only one oyster, the native ostrea edulis , that was grown in waters all round the coast. The French had crassostrea Portugensis , to which the French gave all sorts of fancy names such as Belon, Cancale, Marennes, and gravette d'Arcachon. Then pollution and disease hit our oyster beds, turning the oyster from universal food to rich man's perk. In 1971 the French introduced the fast-growing, sturdier and therefore cheaper Pacific oyster, an example followed a few years later in Britain, and the oyster came back. </p> <p>Oyster producers or retailers had recourse to the usual marketeer's ploy when faced with the problem of how to develop the market - create a number of niche brands within it, each invested with a mysterious and usually indefinable quality. The French are brilliant at this, using the geographical variant of the ploy, and apply the principle to all kinds of foods. Hence l'agneau de Sisteron , which is different from l'agneau de Pauillac , which is different from the l'agneau pre-sale de Bretagne . Then there's poulet de Bresse , asperge de Bugey , and jambon de Morvan , not to mention several hundred cheeses and the oysters named above. </p> <p>We have tried the same thing in Britain. Colchester still has a magic to my ear because it suggests a traditional English oyster, the finest in my view. Then there are oysters from Orford, Helford, Loch Fyne and Galway, mostly Pacifics, but with a few ostrea edulis for good measure. And now peppering fashionable menus is the rock oyster - our old friend the Pacific oyster with a fancy name. Rock has a wreck-caught ring to it which tile-bred, pen-fattened or seabed-sitting, where most oysters are reared, does not, and we will pay happily for that perceived difference. </p> <p>I won't go as far as to say that there's no difference between these and their less exalted equivalents but I will say that the honorific versions have become invested in a fabulous snobbery which helps justify the cost differential. Wreck-caught sea bass will taste no different from mere line-caught sea bass, but both will be superior to farmed sea bass. Diver-caught sea scallops will differ only from the dredged variety in the lack of environmental damage that their retrieval causes. </p> <p>As we have become more affluent - which is not the same thing as discerning - so the breadth of food snobbery has grown. There is no vinegar but balsamic. It is not good enough for coffee to be just coffee, but high roast or medium roast, and not just from Costa Rica, Jamaica, Java, Yemen, Colombia or Nicaragua, but Monsoon Malabar, Kenya Peaberry, Pico Duarte or whatever. Pork must be Middle White, beef be Belted Galloway, partridges have grey legs, bacon be dry-cured, flour stone-ground, and tomatoes vine-ripened. </p> <p>The trouble with this kind of attachment to labels, to the notion of food as fashion accessory, is that there is always a newer, smarter label, another more fashionable fashion, another step in the class ladder. </p> <p>Take caviar, for example. Those with the highest gastro-aspirations look to caviar to provide the ultimate thrill. We all know, don't we, that there's sevruga, oscietra and beluga, with beluga being generally the best and most expensive because the eggs are the largest. There's something of a debate as to whether Russian or Iranian holds sway in terms of desirability. With Russian production largely in the hands of the Mafia, and a good deal of the stuff available being of dubious provenance, the much more tightly regulated Iranian must seem a more reliable bet. </p> <p>So we're agreed that fresh, spring Iranian beluga in a 1.8kg tin - the tin in which the caviar is packed immediately after being salted and sorted - at \u00a36,500, is the finest that money can buy. Start saving. But then there's something called \"golden caviar\" or Almas Diamond, from the incredibly rare albino sturgeon. Once consumed only by the tsars, and later split between Stalin, the Shah of Iran and the chairman of the Russo-Persian Fisheries Company, it is now yours for a measly \u00a37,352 for 500g. Of course, there are those who say it's just a load of one-upmanship. </p> <p>\u0095 The Guzzler will return next week.</p>",

So if you wanted to stay ahead of the game, you couldn't just rely on extra virgin olive oil any more, it had to be the extra virgin olive oil from the San Martino in Prestito estate in Tuscany in the fancy bottle at the fancy price. And you only used that for certain dishes, because its qualities made it suitable only for splashing into the frying pan or rubbing into chicken. For salads, of course, you needed the lighter Ligurian extra virgin olive oil. Now we are seeing two further refinements in the extra virgin olive oil story, the arrival of single varietal oils - olive oils are usually made with a blend of olives - and, naturally, of organic oils. So, look out for the organic extra virgin olive oil made from the Moraiolo olive from San Martino in Prestito. The progress of the olive from humble extra to main player is a template for any wannabe foodstuff. Consider the oyster. In the days of Queen Victoria, there was only one oyster, the native ostrea edulis , that was grown in waters all round the coast. The French had crassostrea Portugensis , to which the French gave all sorts of fancy names such as Belon, Cancale, Marennes, and gravette d'Arcachon. Then pollution and disease hit our oyster beds, turning the oyster from universal food to rich man's perk. In 1971 the French introduced the fast-growing, sturdier and therefore cheaper Pacific oyster, an example followed a few years later in Britain, and the oyster came back. Oyster producers or retailers had recourse to the usual marketeer's ploy when faced with the problem of how to develop the market - create a number of niche brands within it, each invested with a mysterious and usually indefinable quality. The French are brilliant at this, using the geographical variant of the ploy, and apply the principle to all kinds of foods. Hence l'agneau de Sisteron , which is different from l'agneau de Pauillac , which is different from the l'agneau pre-sale de Bretagne . Then there's poulet de Bresse , asperge de Bugey , and jambon de Morvan , not to mention several hundred cheeses and the oysters named above. We have tried the same thing in Britain. Colchester still has a magic to my ear because it suggests a traditional English oyster, the finest in my view. Then there are oysters from Orford, Helford, Loch Fyne and Galway, mostly Pacifics, but with a few ostrea edulis for good measure. And now peppering fashionable menus is the rock oyster - our old friend the Pacific oyster with a fancy name. Rock has a wreck-caught ring to it which tile-bred, pen-fattened or seabed-sitting, where most oysters are reared, does not, and we will pay happily for that perceived difference. I won't go as far as to say that there's no difference between these and their less exalted equivalents but I will say that the honorific versions have become invested in a fabulous snobbery which helps justify the cost differential. Wreck-caught sea bass will taste no different from mere line-caught sea bass, but both will be superior to farmed sea bass. Diver-caught sea scallops will differ only from the dredged variety in the lack of environmental damage that their retrieval causes. As we have become more affluent - which is not the same thing as discerning - so the breadth of food snobbery has grown. There is no vinegar but balsamic. It is not good enough for coffee to be just coffee, but high roast or medium roast, and not just from Costa Rica, Jamaica, Java, Yemen, Colombia or Nicaragua, but Monsoon Malabar, Kenya Peaberry, Pico Duarte or whatever. Pork must be Middle White, beef be Belted Galloway, partridges have grey legs, bacon be dry-cured, flour stone-ground, and tomatoes vine-ripened. The trouble with this kind of attachment to labels, to the notion of food as fashion accessory, is that there is always a newer, smarter label, another more fashionable fashion, another step in the class ladder. Take caviar, for example. Those with the highest gastro-aspirations look to caviar to provide the ultimate thrill. We all know, don't we, that there's sevruga, oscietra and beluga, with beluga being generally the best and most expensive because the eggs are the largest. There's something of a debate as to whether Russian or Iranian holds sway in terms of desirability. With Russian production largely in the hands of the Mafia, and a good deal of the stuff available being of dubious provenance, the much more tightly regulated Iranian must seem a more reliable bet. So we're agreed that fresh, spring Iranian beluga in a 1.8kg tin - the tin in which the caviar is packed immediately after being salted and sorted - at \u00a36,500, is the finest that money can buy. Start saving. But then there's something called \"golden caviar\" or Almas Diamond, from the incredibly rare albino sturgeon. Once consumed only by the tsars, and later split between Stalin, the Shah of Iran and the chairman of the Russo-Persian Fisheries Company, it is now yours for a measly \u00a37,352 for 500g. Of course, there are those who say it's just a load of one-upmanship. \u0095 The Guzzler will return next week.",

It was just one of the many ironies of the week that it should be a Republican who was making some of the most radical political noises.</p> <p>Johnson addressed the Shadow Convention - the event organised by people who felt that the big issues were not being addressed by the main conventions - in the Patriotic Hall, just a few blocks down from the Staples centre, where the Democrats were holding their event.</p> <p>Johnson is an interesting man who was never part of the Republican machine and only decided to run for office at the last moment. The fact that he was elected is an indication of the disillusionment many feel with the machine politicians, who have been taught to believe that any talk about loosening the laws on drugs is political suicide.</p> <p>But to Johnson, the issue is one of life and death. Or rather, quite a few deaths. In a year in the United States, he said, there were 450,000 deaths resulting from nicotine, 150,000 from alcohol, 100,000 from legally prescribed drugs, 5000 from cocaine and heroin and zero from marijuana. The real \"bogeymen\", he said, were alcohol and tobacco.</p> <p>He was joined on the stage by another Republican, the would-be California senator, Tom Campbell. He had a similar message about the \"war on drugs\", and told a clearly amazed audience, used to Republicans talking rather differently, that \"soft on drugs has replaced soft on communism\". And he quoted Abraham Lincoln, saying that prohibition would do great harm to the cause of temperance because \"it makes a crime of that which is not a crime\". What was missing from political leaders, he said, was \"not brain but spine\".</p> <p>Charlie Rangel, a Democratic congressman who represents the Harlem area of New York City, said that he had recently met Fidel Castro in Cuba. Before his trip he had asked Bill Clinton if he had any message for him. The president had wanted him to ask about the political prisoners there. Rangel had asked him what he should say if Castro asked about all the \"political prisoners\" in American jails. \"They are the poorest people, the people of colour, the people that some people like to imagine don't exist,\" said Rangel.</p> <p>So the debate on one of the biggest issues dividing America did take place after all during convention week. But it is taking place in the shadows rather than in the open. President Clinton tried but did not inhale. Vice-President Al Gore tried as a lad but stopped. When George W Bush was, as he puts it, \"young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible\".</p> <p>The difference is that George W, unlike tens of thousands of young Americans, was not jailed for his irresponsibility. The speakers at the drugs debate in Patriotic Hall may be hoping for change, but it is unlikely that they are holding their breath before they exhale.</p>",

Johnson addressed the Shadow Convention - the event organised by people who felt that the big issues were not being addressed by the main conventions - in the Patriotic Hall, just a few blocks down from the Staples centre, where the Democrats were holding their event. Johnson is an interesting man who was never part of the Republican machine and only decided to run for office at the last moment. The fact that he was elected is an indication of the disillusionment many feel with the machine politicians, who have been taught to believe that any talk about loosening the laws on drugs is political suicide. But to Johnson, the issue is one of life and death. Or rather, quite a few deaths. In a year in the United States, he said, there were 450,000 deaths resulting from nicotine, 150,000 from alcohol, 100,000 from legally prescribed drugs, 5000 from cocaine and heroin and zero from marijuana. The real \"bogeymen\", he said, were alcohol and tobacco. He was joined on the stage by another Republican, the would-be California senator, Tom Campbell. He had a similar message about the \"war on drugs\", and told a clearly amazed audience, used to Republicans talking rather differently, that \"soft on drugs has replaced soft on communism\". And he quoted Abraham Lincoln, saying that prohibition would do great harm to the cause of temperance because \"it makes a crime of that which is not a crime\". What was missing from political leaders, he said, was \"not brain but spine\". Charlie Rangel, a Democratic congressman who represents the Harlem area of New York City, said that he had recently met Fidel Castro in Cuba. Before his trip he had asked Bill Clinton if he had any message for him. The president had wanted him to ask about the political prisoners there. Rangel had asked him what he should say if Castro asked about all the \"political prisoners\" in American jails. \"They are the poorest people, the people of colour, the people that some people like to imagine don't exist,\" said Rangel. So the debate on one of the biggest issues dividing America did take place after all during convention week. But it is taking place in the shadows rather than in the open. President Clinton tried but did not inhale. Vice-President Al Gore tried as a lad but stopped. When George W Bush was, as he puts it, \"young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible\". The difference is that George W, unlike tens of thousands of young Americans, was not jailed for his irresponsibility. The speakers at the drugs debate in Patriotic Hall may be hoping for change, but it is unlikely that they are holding their breath before they exhale.",

      "body": "<p>Test matches just don't end at 5pm on the second day, even when it is at Headingley. England just don't win by an innings and 39 runs over West Indies, even when it is the worst Caribbean combination of the modern era. Andy Caddick just doesn't take four wickets in an over, even when the batsmen are befuddled by a quartet of swingers boasting the arc of a Shane Warne leg break. This was the day, even more than Botham's Headingley heroics of '81, that defied all logic. </p> <p>England may not win Tests often, but when they do, they do so spectacularly, even freakishly. This, of course, was the biggest freak show of them all - West Indies all out for 61 in 26.2 overs on a pitch that may not have been a Test-class strip, but was certainly no minefield. </p> <p>But this was a victory with a difference. It was the win of a committed, well-balanced team, rather than the Jekyll-and-Hyde operation that has masqueraded around the world's Test grounds in recent times. England did almost everything right through the entire match - well, both days of it- and have built up steadily since those incredible couple of days at Lord's which now, by comparison, seem almost tame. </p> <p>By the end, Caddick's figures read 11.2-5-14-5. But Gough was the man who turned the Windies into mice. The ball was a living thing in his hand today: spitting, bouncing, cutting, swinging - positively oozing with venom. Campbell, Griffith and Hinds were all befuddled; Lara completely mesmerised. Gough went to tea with figures of 4 for 12, having set the stage for that final dramatic stanza. </p> <p>Glenn McGrath confirmed his place among the pantheon of all-time bowling greats four years ago when he worked over Brian Lara so effectively that he became McGrath's bunny. Gough is not yet in McGrath's class, but he is learning fast. Can it really be that, a la Courtney Walsh, as Gough's knees grow older and sorer his bowling gets smarter? </p> <p>Gough has now dismissed Lara four times out of seven this summer by cramping him for room and refusing to feed his strengths, and even Hansie Cronje would not have bet on the method of the West Indian's demise today. Sticking his chest out, sweeping that periscopic bat high above his head and prodding a pad tentatively forward - plumb lbw - it was almost a complete mirror image of his first-innings downfall. </p> <p>But if you reckon Caddick and Gough left behind a delectable set of numbers, check out those of Michael Vaughan, a surprise choice as man of the match. In his first 11 completed Test innings, the Yorkshire opener-cum-England No. 6 has been dismissed below 29 just four times - a feat that sounds ordinary enough, but was never managed by Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Compton, Cowdrey, May, Graveney, Gooch, Gatting, Lamb, Atherton or Stewart. </p> <p>Nonetheless, today's 76 was only Vaughan's second Test half-century and, given the tainted surroundings of his first at Centurion last winter, he will have derived enormous satisfaction from it. Resuming at 105 for 5, still 67 behind, nobody would have batted an eyelid had England collapsed in a heap and surrendered any lingering advantage they may have held.

      "bodyText": "Test matches just don't end at 5pm on the second day, even when it is at Headingley. England just don't win by an innings and 39 runs over West Indies, even when it is the worst Caribbean combination of the modern era. Andy Caddick just doesn't take four wickets in an over, even when the batsmen are befuddled by a quartet of swingers boasting the arc of a Shane Warne leg break. This was the day, even more than Botham's Headingley heroics of '81, that defied all logic. England may not win Tests often, but when they do, they do so spectacularly, even freakishly. This, of course, was the biggest freak show of them all - West Indies all out for 61 in 26.2 overs on a pitch that may not have been a Test-class strip, but was certainly no minefield. But this was a victory with a difference. It was the win of a committed, well-balanced team, rather than the Jekyll-and-Hyde operation that has masqueraded around the world's Test grounds in recent times. England did almost everything right through the entire match - well, both days of it- and have built up steadily since those incredible couple of days at Lord's which now, by comparison, seem almost tame. By the end, Caddick's figures read 11.2-5-14-5. But Gough was the man who turned the Windies into mice. The ball was a living thing in his hand today: spitting, bouncing, cutting, swinging - positively oozing with venom. Campbell, Griffith and Hinds were all befuddled; Lara completely mesmerised. Gough went to tea with figures of 4 for 12, having set the stage for that final dramatic stanza. Glenn McGrath confirmed his place among the pantheon of all-time bowling greats four years ago when he worked over Brian Lara so effectively that he became McGrath's bunny. Gough is not yet in McGrath's class, but he is learning fast. Can it really be that, a la Courtney Walsh, as Gough's knees grow older and sorer his bowling gets smarter? Gough has now dismissed Lara four times out of seven this summer by cramping him for room and refusing to feed his strengths, and even Hansie Cronje would not have bet on the method of the West Indian's demise today. Sticking his chest out, sweeping that periscopic bat high above his head and prodding a pad tentatively forward - plumb lbw - it was almost a complete mirror image of his first-innings downfall. But if you reckon Caddick and Gough left behind a delectable set of numbers, check out those of Michael Vaughan, a surprise choice as man of the match. In his first 11 completed Test innings, the Yorkshire opener-cum-England No. 6 has been dismissed below 29 just four times - a feat that sounds ordinary enough, but was never managed by Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Compton, Cowdrey, May, Graveney, Gooch, Gatting, Lamb, Atherton or Stewart. Nonetheless, today's 76 was only Vaughan's second Test half-century and, given the tainted surroundings of his first at Centurion last winter, he will have derived enormous satisfaction from it. Resuming at 105 for 5, still 67 behind, nobody would have batted an eyelid had England collapsed in a heap and surrendered any lingering advantage they may have held. Instead, Vaughan and Hick - with a mixture of flair and Australian-like resolve - ensured that the tail well and truly wagged, carrying England to a first-innings lead of 100. Again, the West Indies support bowlers flagged: between them, Walsh and Ambrose had figures of 42.5-12-93-8; King and McLean read 33-7-141-1. Playing seven batsmen may not be the best long-term strategy, but the sensible horses-for-courses policy of England's selectors worked wonders here. At No. 8 (has he at last found his niche?)

The KDP said the jets attacked an area inside Iraq close to the borders of Turkey and Iran, where Turkish Kurd guerrillas loyal to the imprisoned Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) leader Abdullah Ocalan have a number of bases. \"On August 15, while Turkish warplanes were pursuing PKK targets, a pasture camp inside Iraqi Kurdistan belonging to Iraqi Kurdish herdsmen and their families fell victim to the Turkish air raid,\" the KDP said. \"As a result 38 civilians were killed, 11 were injured and four are missing.\" Turkish military officials said they knew nothing of the incident. \"It is out of the question for us to bomb civilians,\" an army official said. \"Air operations in northern Iraq target the PKK,\" he said. The remote mountainous area of northern Iraq, outside Baghdad's control since the end of the Gulf war in 1991, is ruled by Massoud Barzani's KDP and a rival Iraqi Kurdish group. Ocalan's PKK, fighting for Kurdish self-rule in south-east Turkey, have long used the region as a base to mount cross-border raids, provoking frequent incursions by Turkish forces. The KDP's peshmerga fighters have regularly cooperated with Turkish troops to fight the PKK. \"We denounce this action which has led to the loss of so many innocent lives,\" the statement said. \"We demand that this incident be thoroughly investigated and that the victims are properly compensated.\" The Iraqi Kurdish satellite television channel, Kurdistan TV, showed the wounded, several of them small children, lying on hospital beds in the regional capital, Irbil. \"We were grazing our animals in the summer pastures,\" said a woman. \"Suddenly the planes flew over, then they flew back again and there were explosions everywhere. \"I don't know what happened then, but everywhere was covered in blood.\" \"We have nothing to do with the PKK,\" said another woman. \"We don't know why they bombed us, we were just grazing our animals.\" Reuters",

By tradition, a presidential nominee only makes one appearance at the convention: to deliver his acceptance speech at the close of proceedings. The biographical blitz shows that the chief problem for the Democrats in translating America's glittering economic and social record during the Clinton-Gore years into success at the ballot box is not the much discussed Clinton factor but the less widely acknowledged Gore factor. Mr Gore's life story has become the vehicle for the attempted transformation of a campaign still well adrift in the polls, in spite of recent improvements. \"The principal communication goal, certainly through the next few weeks, is to get people to know Al Gore better as a person,\" his senior adviser, Tad Devine, said.",

Jim Mullen, president and chief executive officer of the Massachusetts-based biotech company, which makes Avonex, an injectable interferon treatment for MS, earlier yesterday announced an alliance with an Irish biotech company, Elan Corp, to jointly develop another MS drug - Antegren. He expected that Antegren, a humanised monoclonal antibody, used either in combination with Avonex or alone, would expand the worldwide market by meeting currently unmet needs. Opec refuses to be rushed Opec will not make any decision on changing oil production ceilings until the cartel's ministers meet on September 10 in Vienna, according to the newspaper Al-Riyadh, which reflects the official Saudi point of view. Citing advisers based in Opec's Vienna headquarters, Al-Riyadh said the oil price adjustment mechanism agreed on at an Opec meeting in March will not go into effect before next month's meeting. \"Seeing the proximity of the coming ministerial meeting, one shouldn't expect any measure before it,\" the newspaper said. Vivendi merger in the clear Vivendi said US regulators had raised no objections to its proposed three-way merger with Canal Plus and Seagram to form Vivendi Universal. \"The statutory period during which US competition authorities could have asked for additional information has passed without any such requests having been made,\" a Vivendi spokesman said. \"The US anti-trust inquiry is de facto at an end.\" Last week the European commission demanded further details regarding the proposed merger.",

The winner of Big Brother's \u00a370,000 prize is the last person left in the house after contestants and members of the public have voted the rest out. Nick had been writing notes and showing them to fellow contestants in an attempt to influence their voting intentions. \"The rules of Big Brother expressly forbid contestants from talking about nominations and tactical voting,\" Channel 4 said. His position was untenable. Because Nick leaves the show outside of the weekly eviction process, his place will be taken by a replacement drawn from a list of back-up candidates. The new contestant's identity has not yet been announced. The website took 6m hits yesterday, making Big Brother by far the most popular event to have been broadcast on the internet in Britain. Despite his lack of popularity with viewers, Nick's tactics had proved a success with his housemates. Each week the participants must nominate two of their number for eviction - the public has the final say in a telephone vote - but not once did they pick Nick. Dr Linda Papadopoulos, the show's counselling psychologist, told the Big Brother website yesterday: \"He realised who everyone wanted to be and he allowed them to be just that person when he was with them. He played them.\" Such was the scale of his deviousness that rumours spread that he was a Channel 4 mole. The press reported that he had smuggled in a mobile phone, but a search found nothing. Last night Nick was holed up in a hotel in central London with his family, a psychologist, and minders from the programme, as the events of yesterday were screened in an extended programme on Channel 4. His eviction - and that of Craig or Nichola, depending on the outcome of this week's vote - will be shown on tonight's broadcasts.",

      "body": "<p>After the poor performance of the RAF in both the Gulf and now Kosovo, the wonder is that anyone in the world would want to pay for British arms. And yet they still do. The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that Britain is the world's second biggest exporter of arms, coming in behind the US and ahead of Germany, France and Russia.</p> <p>Britain was responsible for 22% of arms sales worldwide last year, an astonishingly high share of the market for a relatively small country, especially one whose planes have proved suspect in combat.</p> <p>The arms industry has done more than anything else to undermine the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his promise to introduce an ethical dimension into foreign policy. A foreign minister from another country, reviewing Mr Cook's performance over the past three years, summed it up succinctly: \"You can't have an ethical foreign policy and an arms industry.\"</p> <p>That foreign minister was wrong. It is possible to conduct both an ethical foreign policy and maintain an arms industry. The bulk of arms sales are non-contentious: it is sales to countries that are non-democratic and have little respect for human rights that create the controversy.</p> <p>An annual report on arms sales published last month by the MoD, the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, showed that the government granted licences for arms sales last year amounting to \u00a3900m. Some of the biggest British orders were to non-contentious countries such as Canada (\u00a336m), Germany (\u00a345m), France (\u00a336m), the US (\u00a386m) and Italy (\u00a369m). The British arms industry would not disappear if a curb were placed on contentious countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Taken together, the dubious countries account for about a third of sales. It is a relatively small figure: certainly not worth the damage caused to Britain's image both at home and overseas.</p> <p>But the defence industry in this country is a powerful lobby. It argues that if Britain does not sell to those countries, there are plenty of others who will. It also argues that if Britain is seen as too self-righteous about selling to dubious regimes, this will have a negative effect on all British arms exports.</p> <p>The main argument is the impact on jobs. The MoD estimates that there are 355,000 British jobs dependent on the arms industry and of these, 130,000 depend on arms exports. Stripping out sales to dubious regimes could cost a third of these jobs, about 40,000. That seems a lot and would be hurtful for those involved. But the decline in manufacturing industry over the past two decades has seen huge numbers displaced and absorbed elsewhere.</p> <p>Much of the defence industry is beginning to diversify anyway into civilian products. The changes have been forced on it by a dramatic decline in arms sales since the end of the cold war and a slump in the Asian markets. The value of arms licences issued by the government in 1993 was \u00a35bn, in 1997 \u00a33.35bn, in 1998 \u00a31.9bn and last year down to \u00a3900m.</p> <p>The decline has meant a more competitive industry and costs becoming marginal. So why does Britain persevere in a dwindling market?</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said yesterday that arms exports helped offset the cost of developing and producing weapons for British forces. He estimated this amounted to \u00a3400m a year of taxpayers' money saved. But this is offset by the huge amounts of taxpayers' money that have gone out in promoting British sales overseas. The MoD has a section (the defence exports services organisation), specially for this purpose, with its own staff overseas. Sales promotion is also part of work of the wide network of British defence attaches who work at embassies round the world.</p> <p>There are further hidden subsidies for the arms industry. The notorious export credit guarantee department, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, has for years provided money to developing countries to buy British arms. Aid in the past has been used as part of a quid pro quo for arms sales.</p> <p>Mr Cook feels hard done by over the charges of hypocrisy levelled at him over the ethical dimension to his foreign policy. He has some justification for feeling hurt. At least he has tried. If the Conservatives had been in charge, there would have been no mention of an ethical foreign policy. And if Peter Mandelson or Jack Straw or some other minister replaces Mr Cook at the foreign office after the general election, the chances are the \"ethical dimension\" will be little heard of again. Mr Cook's problem is that he set a benchmark against which his foreign policy could be judged. He has lost out in arguments with the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry and, decisively, Downing Street.</p> <p>The powerful defence industry needs to be tackled. Sadly, Mr Cook may turn out to have been the best bet for achieving that change, but to have failed.

      "bodyText": "After the poor performance of the RAF in both the Gulf and now Kosovo, the wonder is that anyone in the world would want to pay for British arms. And yet they still do. The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that Britain is the world's second biggest exporter of arms, coming in behind the US and ahead of Germany, France and Russia. Britain was responsible for 22% of arms sales worldwide last year, an astonishingly high share of the market for a relatively small country, especially one whose planes have proved suspect in combat. The arms industry has done more than anything else to undermine the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and his promise to introduce an ethical dimension into foreign policy. A foreign minister from another country, reviewing Mr Cook's performance over the past three years, summed it up succinctly: \"You can't have an ethical foreign policy and an arms industry.\" That foreign minister was wrong. It is possible to conduct both an ethical foreign policy and maintain an arms industry. The bulk of arms sales are non-contentious: it is sales to countries that are non-democratic and have little respect for human rights that create the controversy. An annual report on arms sales published last month by the MoD, the Foreign Office and the Department of Trade and Industry, showed that the government granted licences for arms sales last year amounting to \u00a3900m. Some of the biggest British orders were to non-contentious countries such as Canada (\u00a336m), Germany (\u00a345m), France (\u00a336m), the US (\u00a386m) and Italy (\u00a369m). The British arms industry would not disappear if a curb were placed on contentious countries such as Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Taken together, the dubious countries account for about a third of sales. It is a relatively small figure: certainly not worth the damage caused to Britain's image both at home and overseas. But the defence industry in this country is a powerful lobby. It argues that if Britain does not sell to those countries, there are plenty of others who will. It also argues that if Britain is seen as too self-righteous about selling to dubious regimes, this will have a negative effect on all British arms exports. The main argument is the impact on jobs. The MoD estimates that there are 355,000 British jobs dependent on the arms industry and of these, 130,000 depend on arms exports. Stripping out sales to dubious regimes could cost a third of these jobs, about 40,000. That seems a lot and would be hurtful for those involved. But the decline in manufacturing industry over the past two decades has seen huge numbers displaced and absorbed elsewhere. Much of the defence industry is beginning to diversify anyway into civilian products. The changes have been forced on it by a dramatic decline in arms sales since the end of the cold war and a slump in the Asian markets. The value of arms licences issued by the government in 1993 was \u00a35bn, in 1997 \u00a33.35bn, in 1998 \u00a31.9bn and last year down to \u00a3900m. The decline has meant a more competitive industry and costs becoming marginal. So why does Britain persevere in a dwindling market? An MoD spokesman said yesterday that arms exports helped offset the cost of developing and producing weapons for British forces. He estimated this amounted to \u00a3400m a year of taxpayers' money saved. But this is offset by the huge amounts of taxpayers' money that have gone out in promoting British sales overseas. The MoD has a section (the defence exports services organisation), specially for this purpose, with its own staff overseas. Sales promotion is also part of work of the wide network of British defence attaches who work at embassies round the world. There are further hidden subsidies for the arms industry. The notorious export credit guarantee department, part of the Department of Trade and Industry, has for years provided money to developing countries to buy British arms. Aid in the past has been used as part of a quid pro quo for arms sales. Mr Cook feels hard done by over the charges of hypocrisy levelled at him over the ethical dimension to his foreign policy. He has some justification for feeling hurt. At least he has tried. If the Conservatives had been in charge, there would have been no mention of an ethical foreign policy. And if Peter Mandelson or Jack Straw or some other minister replaces Mr Cook at the foreign office after the general election, the chances are the \"ethical dimension\" will be little heard of again. Mr Cook's problem is that he set a benchmark against which his foreign policy could be judged. He has lost out in arguments with the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry and, decisively, Downing Street. The powerful defence industry needs to be tackled. Sadly, Mr Cook may turn out to have been the best bet for achieving that change, but to have failed. The chances are Britain will continue proudly to proclaim its place as second biggest arms exporter in the world, regardless of both the ethics and economics. ewen.macaskill@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Safety risks with \"potentially serious consequences\" have been uncovered in John Prescott's plans to partly privatise the London Underground, less than six months before contracts are due to be signed, a private letter from the government's chief rail inspector has revealed. In a memorandum to the company's management last week, which has been passed to the Guardian, the principal rail safety inspector, Stanley Hart, warned of a \"growing concern\" about safety in the partly sold-off tube system that the deputy prime minister wants to bring in next spring. Describing himself as frustrated, Mr Hart accused London Underground of overseeing a \"breakdown in local management control\" in the structures that had been set up for the plans, with \"either no proof that the systems work or proof that they are not working\". The disclosure comes at a highly sensitive time for the government, in the run-up to the Labour party conference next month. Its plans to break up the tube and bring in private companies to run the infrastructure are likely to come under strong attack from trade unionists and party activists. The catalogue of disasters since the privatisation of British Rail and the admission by the rail inspectorate at the Paddington crash inquiry this year that it had failed to keep a grip on the fragmented private industry have made the issue of safety in the plans for London Underground more sensitive. Mr Prescott's Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the health and safety executive - of which the rail inspectorate is part - yesterday refused to comment on the leaked letter. But the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, who made opposition to the partial tube sell-off a central plank of his election campaign, seized on the letter as evidence of the dangers of pressing ahead, although he has no legal powers to stop the deals. \"This letter will confirm Londoners' worst fears about the government's public-private partnership scheme and highlights the risk of a Paddington-style crash underground,\" he said last night. \"The partial sell-off is a threat to the lives of Londoners. The government should heed these warnings and withdraw their dangerous and ill-conceived plans.\" The government intends to pass on responsibility for the tube to Mr Livingstone only after it has handed over the infrastructure - accounting for about half the business - to private sector companies on the basis of 30-year contracts. The network is being split into three parts, and bids are already in for two of them. If the contracts go ahead as planned early next year the structure could be locked in place for a generation. In his letter, Mr Hart said his inspectorate had \"consistently expressed a growing concern that it does not have full confidence\" in London Underground's systems being \"shadowed\" in preparation for break-up and part-privatisation. It was vital that there was an effective system of ensuring compliance with safety rules, he said. \"There is evidence that these criteria are not being met consistently.\" A \"further disquieting aspect\" was the lack of central responsibility in the planned system, when central co-ordination was \"essential\", he added.",

That portfolio has enabled former Smithfield meat trader David Thompson, 63, and his son Richard, 35, to amass a combined fortune which the Sunday Times' rich list last year estimated at \u00a3340m. </p> <p>Mr Leonard's fraud at Muirpace, the Thompson controlled commodities firm, has hit his former employees hard. According to the Sunday newspaper, it has helped knock back their fortune by around \u00a390m. </p> <p>The Thompsons were stunned when, two years ago, Mr Leonard confessed that he had run up multimillion-pound losses through a series of unsuccessful trades. </p> <p>Not only had Mr Leonard been one of their longest serving and most trusted employees, but he had also become a close friend through their shared passion for racehorses. Mr Leonard was well known in racing circles as a punter and an owner. </p> <p>His biggest claim to fame was that he was joint owner of Top Cees when the gelding won the 1995 Chester Cup. </p> <p>He and the Thompsons - who own the Chevely Park Stud in Newmarket and owned the 1992 Grand National winner Party Politics -became close. </p> <p>Mr Leonard also wholly or partly owned horses named Exit to Rio, Creative Account, Mock Trial and No Extradition. \"Looking back, perhaps we should have seen the signs,\" Richard Thompson said. \"Subconsciously he was obviously feeling a little guilty.\" </p> <p>Mr Leonard's trading at Muirpace blew a hole in both his friendship with the Thompsons and their accounts. Documents that were filed in Companies House for Southfield Trading Group, one of the main Thompson companies, reveal that operating losses increased from \u00a3990,717 during the 12 months to October 1997 to \u00a39.25m for the next 18 months. Sales for the same periods were \u00a379.6m compared with \u00a373m. </p> <p>Southfield's directors write that the losses were \"almost entirely attributable to the fraud at Muirpace\", and they hope that Southfield will now recover and \"give the rest of the group an opportunity to return to profitability\". </p> <p>The Thompsons are still taking advice on whether legal claims can be made in an attempt to recoup the Muirpace losses. Richard Thompson, though, is concentrating on the film business. As chairman of AIM-listed Civilian Content, he is trying to turn what was once a meat-packing business into a successful film production company. </p> <p>The birth of his new venture has been troubled. Civilian's first film, Gangster Number 1, starring Malcolm McDowell and Saffron Burrows, has recouped just a fraction of its budget at the box office, according to Screen International magazine. </p> <p>It claims that the movie grossed \u00a3325,552 in its first eight weeks - a figure that Civilian insists should be nearer to \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>The film, which had a budget of \u00a34.5m and was largely funded by Channel 4, may be re-released in cinemas. </p> <p>Mr Thompson is hopeful that the video release and overseas rights could also recoup more of the budget. Several more scripts are under development and Mr Thompson is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the future. </p> <p>On July 14, a month after the release of Gangster, he sold 1.24m shares in Civilian. Some shareholders fear it is a sign that he does not have much faith in the business; he insists, though, that he was merely enabling other people to become involved in a company in which it is difficult to buy shares because the stock is so tightly held. </p> <p>Civilian's strategy change concerned some small shareholders.

Here, Redford plays a history researcher who narrowly misses the seemingly pointless assassination of his colleagues; hunted by icy hitman Max von Sydow, he struggles to uncover the renegade CIA faction that's responsible. Edgy, convoluted and clever, there's also room for a credible affair with Faye Dunaway, with whom Redford seeks refuge. </p> <p><strong> Demon Seed</strong> </p> <p>(Donald Cammell, 1977) </p> <p>11.05pm, TCM </p> <p>Curious sci-fi project from the doomed young co-director of psychedelic gangster movie, Performance. Fortunately it stars Julie Christie, but unfortunately she's playing a woman terrorised by Proteus, a computer that wants to impregnate her with its brainchild. It's a crazy idea that doesn't quite work. </p> <p><strong> Cop Land </strong><br> (James Mangold, 1997) </p> <p>12.05am, Sky Premier </p> <p>Garrison, New Jersey is inhabited almost exclusively by New York cops.

      "bodyText": "Three Days Of The Condor (Sydney Pollack, 1975) 8pm, Sky Cinema This superb post-Watergate conspiracy thriller is by some distance the best of the Sydeny Pollack-Robert Redford collaborations (Havana, Out Of Africa and all). Here, Redford plays a history researcher who narrowly misses the seemingly pointless assassination of his colleagues; hunted by icy hitman Max von Sydow, he struggles to uncover the renegade CIA faction that's responsible. Edgy, convoluted and clever, there's also room for a credible affair with Faye Dunaway, with whom Redford seeks refuge. Demon Seed (Donald Cammell, 1977) 11.05pm, TCM Curious sci-fi project from the doomed young co-director of psychedelic gangster movie, Performance. Fortunately it stars Julie Christie, but unfortunately she's playing a woman terrorised by Proteus, a computer that wants to impregnate her with its brainchild. It's a crazy idea that doesn't quite work. Cop Land (James Mangold, 1997) 12.05am, Sky Premier Garrison, New Jersey is inhabited almost exclusively by New York cops. And for gone-to-seed, heavily overweight sheriff Sylvester Stallone, life's easy. But then a murder brings in Internal Affairs man Robert de Niro, who makes it clear that many of these cops are bad apples, Harvey Keitel's top dog in particular. An interesting script that settles for routine heroics. Atlantic City (Louis Malle, 1980) 12.45am, Carlton Cinema Burt Lancaster with a moving depiction of a petty crook who catches a glimpse of the big time. Fascinated by his young waitress neighbour Susan Sarandon, he's soon embroiled in husband Robert Joy's drugs racket. Malle's heartfelt study of people and their dreams is beautiful.",

It may be too late by the time they arrive, tomorrow afternoon, to carry out what would be an astonishing rescue mission. But it seems to be the last hope. \"The Russians recognise we represent the best opportunity for a timely rescue,\" a Royal Navy submariner said yesterday. Ministry of Defence officials who have been in touch with the Russian navy since the beginning of the week said yesterday this was not the time for recrimination. As far as the Royal Navy is concerned, this is a humanitarian mission. Whatever reticence the Russians had has evaporated. \"All our questions have been answered,\" said an MoD official involved in the rescue plans. Yesterday, the white LR5 rescue vehicle, described by Mike Finney, former commander of a nuclear submarine, as an \"underwater helicopter,\" was lifted on to the Normand Pioneer, chartered by the navy, at the Norwegian port of Trondheim. Its advantage is that it can operate independently and navigate with pinpoint accuracy. But its top speed is 3 knots. \"It will not be easy, ocean currents are a law unto themselves,\" a navy submariner said. The plan is for three Russians, including a doctor, to join the LR5's crew in the first attempt to open the escape hatch on the Kursk's stern. The LR5 will also carry oxygen, food, and electric power. \"You cannot tell whether it is too late. No one can tell if they're out of oxygen,\" Commander David Stanesby said in Trondheim.

The Ministry of Defence insisted that chartering the Normand Pioneer was the quickest way to prepare for the rescue mission. The runway at Murmansk, Russia's northern naval base closest to the Kursk, was not long enough to take the Antonov aircraft which flew the LR5 to Trondheim on Wednesday, according to an MoD official. Russia's deputy naval chief of staff, Alexander Pobozhy, sidestepped questions about why the LR5 was flown to Norway instead of a Russian airfield. \"It was the most optimum option for us,\" he said after a meeting at Nato headquarters in Brussels. \"It was the most acceptable option for us.\" Norway is sending 12-15 deep-sea divers, with experience from offshore oil and gas exploration, to assist the British mission. Admiral Pobozhy said after the Brussels meeting that there could still be many days before oxygen ran out. \"From our experience with the Soviet submarine forces, it can be as long as two to three weeks.\" The atmosphere at the meeting was described as \"very open and expert\". \"There was a real spirit of cooperation,\" said a Nato source.",

      "body": "<p>This week, before the horrified gaze of the world, the Kursk has become part of the swelling armada of dead Russian nuclear submarines, most of which are to be found in the ports of the Kola peninsula of north-west Russia.</p> <p>If the tragedy focuses attention on Russia's ballooning nuclear waste problem, then some good may yet come of it. What has been lacking has been political will in Russian and abroad. The loss of the Kursk could change that. There is still time - just.</p> <p>From a radiation point of view, the Kola peninsula is one of the cleanest places in Europe. A bit of strontium 90 from the atmospheric atom bomb test of the 1950s, to be sure - you get that everywhere. On land, there is background radon (as on Dartmoor). In the Barents, Kara and White seas, there is caesium 137, but half of that comes from jolly old Windscale/Sellafield.</p> <p>But Kola also boasts the greatest latent potential for catastrophic release of radioactivity on the planet. An audit of 1993, ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, opened the issue for scrutiny. Kola is home to huge numbers of operating and defunct reactors.</p> <p>Between 1954 and 1996, the Soviet Union built 287 nuclear submarines, containing more than 500 reactors. Of these, a minimum of 183 - and perhaps as many as 245 - are now out of service, and at least 120 of those still have fuelled reactors. The Northern Fleet has 142 subs and three battlecruisers (300-plus reactors) in or out of service. Then there are 10 icebreakers and a container ship. In the tally are 16 dumped reactors, including six with unrecovered fuel from nuclear accidents, such as the one that overtook the icebreaker Lenin. To that must now be added the two fuelled reactors of the Kursk.</p> <p>So Kola has an abundance of spent nuclear fuel from ships needing containment. Then there is the Kola power station. Two of its reactors are judged by the International Atomic Energy Authority to have a 25% likelihood of critical failure in the next 20 years. There is no containment. This, however, is the power station that powers the pumps that cool the shut-down submarine reactors that await decommissioning and disposal. When the electricity company cut the Russian navy off for non-payment a few years ago, marines appeared, submachine guns in hand, to help change its mind. A new Kola nuclear power station is planned.</p> <p>There is no adequate technical provision to deal with this stuff. The main hope is the Russian reprocessing plant at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk, with western-funded medium-term storage under construction there. However, shortage of special rolling stock restricts the capacity to move material from Kola by rail. A long-term repository is being discussed. The Russians want to put it on the island of Novaya Zemlya - but it is hard to reach and its geology is fractured by previous nuclear tests. Western experts favour a site on Kola, near the stuff. No early agreement is expected.</p> <p>This situation is a product of the myopia that has been a characteristic of nuclear industries, west and east. They think in straight lines, and then only about the bits that they like, rather than of full-life cycles. Only now, with the armada of dead vessels swelling, is the Rubin Design Bureau, whose gifted engineers helped to build the Soviet submarine fleet (including, very recently, the Oscar design of the Kursk), being asked to un-design them.</p> <p>Accommodation for spent fuel has been much reduced by accidents. Two storage ponds at the Andreyeva Bay naval facility had to be abandoned in 1982 because poor construction had led to leakage through cracked concrete and failed welds. The storage pool and dry dock at Gremikha failed too, for similar reasons. The Norwegian Bellona Foundation has evidence that drunkenness in the workforce prevented repair. Spent fuel is stored in Northern Fleet service tenders. Four (in Murmansk and Severodvinsk), are over 25 years old and full. With nowhere better to put the stuff, all these old, badly maintained barges are accidents waiting to happen. Spent fuel stands, inadequately shielded, on the quayside.</p> <p>Like the brooms activated by the sorcerer's apprentice, the block decommissioning of the Soviet fleet is producing increasing volumes of fresh spent fuel. The Russian government plans to decommission 150 submarines by 2007. The present least-bad option is to leave the fuel in reactors on board. But left too long, fuel channels may distort. Defuelling then becomes impossible, so the entire reactors have to be disposed of. Unmaintained, the submarine hulls corrode. Some have sunk at their moorings.</p> <p>The west wants to help. But at a recent meeting the cost of disposal quoted by the Russians was twice the equivalent western figure. The Russians would like to be paid to clean up; the west is reluctant to hand over cash.

      "bodyText": "This week, before the horrified gaze of the world, the Kursk has become part of the swelling armada of dead Russian nuclear submarines, most of which are to be found in the ports of the Kola peninsula of north-west Russia. If the tragedy focuses attention on Russia's ballooning nuclear waste problem, then some good may yet come of it. What has been lacking has been political will in Russian and abroad. The loss of the Kursk could change that. There is still time - just. From a radiation point of view, the Kola peninsula is one of the cleanest places in Europe. A bit of strontium 90 from the atmospheric atom bomb test of the 1950s, to be sure - you get that everywhere. On land, there is background radon (as on Dartmoor). In the Barents, Kara and White seas, there is caesium 137, but half of that comes from jolly old Windscale/Sellafield. But Kola also boasts the greatest latent potential for catastrophic release of radioactivity on the planet. An audit of 1993, ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, opened the issue for scrutiny. Kola is home to huge numbers of operating and defunct reactors. Between 1954 and 1996, the Soviet Union built 287 nuclear submarines, containing more than 500 reactors. Of these, a minimum of 183 - and perhaps as many as 245 - are now out of service, and at least 120 of those still have fuelled reactors. The Northern Fleet has 142 subs and three battlecruisers (300-plus reactors) in or out of service. Then there are 10 icebreakers and a container ship. In the tally are 16 dumped reactors, including six with unrecovered fuel from nuclear accidents, such as the one that overtook the icebreaker Lenin. To that must now be added the two fuelled reactors of the Kursk. So Kola has an abundance of spent nuclear fuel from ships needing containment. Then there is the Kola power station. Two of its reactors are judged by the International Atomic Energy Authority to have a 25% likelihood of critical failure in the next 20 years. There is no containment. This, however, is the power station that powers the pumps that cool the shut-down submarine reactors that await decommissioning and disposal. When the electricity company cut the Russian navy off for non-payment a few years ago, marines appeared, submachine guns in hand, to help change its mind. A new Kola nuclear power station is planned. There is no adequate technical provision to deal with this stuff. The main hope is the Russian reprocessing plant at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk, with western-funded medium-term storage under construction there. However, shortage of special rolling stock restricts the capacity to move material from Kola by rail. A long-term repository is being discussed. The Russians want to put it on the island of Novaya Zemlya - but it is hard to reach and its geology is fractured by previous nuclear tests. Western experts favour a site on Kola, near the stuff. No early agreement is expected. This situation is a product of the myopia that has been a characteristic of nuclear industries, west and east. They think in straight lines, and then only about the bits that they like, rather than of full-life cycles. Only now, with the armada of dead vessels swelling, is the Rubin Design Bureau, whose gifted engineers helped to build the Soviet submarine fleet (including, very recently, the Oscar design of the Kursk), being asked to un-design them. Accommodation for spent fuel has been much reduced by accidents. Two storage ponds at the Andreyeva Bay naval facility had to be abandoned in 1982 because poor construction had led to leakage through cracked concrete and failed welds. The storage pool and dry dock at Gremikha failed too, for similar reasons. The Norwegian Bellona Foundation has evidence that drunkenness in the workforce prevented repair. Spent fuel is stored in Northern Fleet service tenders. Four (in Murmansk and Severodvinsk), are over 25 years old and full. With nowhere better to put the stuff, all these old, badly maintained barges are accidents waiting to happen. Spent fuel stands, inadequately shielded, on the quayside. Like the brooms activated by the sorcerer's apprentice, the block decommissioning of the Soviet fleet is producing increasing volumes of fresh spent fuel. The Russian government plans to decommission 150 submarines by 2007. The present least-bad option is to leave the fuel in reactors on board. But left too long, fuel channels may distort. Defuelling then becomes impossible, so the entire reactors have to be disposed of. Unmaintained, the submarine hulls corrode. Some have sunk at their moorings. The west wants to help. But at a recent meeting the cost of disposal quoted by the Russians was twice the equivalent western figure. The Russians would like to be paid to clean up; the west is reluctant to hand over cash. People recall the European Union auditors' report on money for safety at nuclear power-stations, which disappeared. The whole issue is darkened by a cloud from another source - the inveterate culture of secrecy that hangs over Russian military, especially nuclear, matters. Of principal concern today is the case of a former Russian navy captain, Alexander Nikitin. The authorities decided to make an example of him. Put on trial for high treason for revealing information about the Russian navy (information that was actually already known to western researchers from other sources), he was hounded through the courts for years until he was acquitted by the St Petersburg city court last December.

On a train between Birmingham and Glasgow this year he said he was a barrister in the Lockerbie trial called Lachlan Campbell-Breedem QC and that his laptop computer containing vital information had been stolen. The train was halted and delayed while an extensive search was carried out by staff. Because of the delay, he persuaded Virgin trains to put him up at the hotel in Edinburgh for three nights at a cost of \u00a3545. To make the story more convincing, he wore a barrister's robes and a wig that he had stolen from Birmingham crown court. Bint disappeared from the hotel then turned up in Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, wearing a white coat. He persuaded a taxi driver to take him to a hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, saying he was a doctor there who was urgently needed for a transplant operation. A judge once told him: \"You are not mentally ill. You have an unfortunate talent which you have used over and over again to persuade others your fantasy world exists.\" He was first caught in 1983 when he posed as a doctor, but only after he had arranged x-rays, tended to a man with a collapsed lung and put 12 stitches in another person's head wound. He also tried to trick his way into a heart bypass operation. In the same year he gatecrashed a party given by Viscount Linley, where he tried to introduce himself to Koo Stark by sending a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne to her table. Bint has spent a total of 10 years in prison and mental institutions. In July 1993 he was ordered to be detained indefinitely at a psychiatric hospital in York after he pretended to be a doctor at St James's hospital in Leeds. He was released from hospital the following year and was soon caught at the Royal Preston hospital and Blackburn Royal infirmary pretending to be a locum called Dr Pearce Hanson. He groped a woman patient and told her: \"Trust me, I'm a doctor.\" He told the parents of a girl aged 17 who had been injured in a road accident that she would survive. She died six hours later. He has also been jailed for tricking a car salesman out of a \u00a383,000 Ferrari which he took for a test drive while calling himself the Earl of Arundel. A Porsche and a Rolls-Royce were spirited away by Bint when he pretended to be an aristocrat. Last year he changed tack and decided to go \"into law\". But once again he has found himself on the wrong side of it.",

The programmers are aware, my friend went on, that nothing grabs the attention quite so well as gloom and alarmism, particularly when it's sunny outside.

      "bodyText": "Have you ever noticed, a friend of mine asked the other day, how in August, just when New Yorkers are heading to the beach, the Discovery channel starts showing endless reruns of documentaries about sharks? The programmers are aware, my friend went on, that nothing grabs the attention quite so well as gloom and alarmism, particularly when it's sunny outside. Our darker natures know that the apparent cheeriness of things is not to be trusted. The allure of gloom was also my friend's explanation for the surprise appearance on the current New York Times bestseller list of From Dawn to Decadence, a massive survey of 500 years of western culture by Jacques Barzun, a 92-year-old former professor at Columbia University. There is much that could be said about From Dawn to Decadence, which is jostling for space on the list with The Day John Died, about JFK Jr, and something called Life on the Other Side, a psychic's tour of the afterlife which is, strangely, in the non-fiction category.

The gloomiest new release of the week was Autumn in New York, which features Richard Gere as a 48-year-old Manhattan restaurateur and womaniser who falls for Winona Ryder, a 22-year-old with a fatal heart condition. The movie fails for many reasons, among them the deluded notion of the Gere character that what the average 22-year-old woman wants from an older man is commitment; anyone who has actually been a 22-year-old woman will remember that what she wants is to be taken out to expensive dinners and to spend the night somewhere other than the apartment she shares with four room-mates.

A lovely old duffer in a Viyella shirt, tweed jacket and wobbly hat pottering about six small English towns with a camera crew in tow and speaking quietly of their simple virtues. No, not the camera crew's, the buildings'. Nice bit of pargetting here, a rather natty example of hood-moulding there. Cosy clapboarding. Soft Flemish bond brickwork. Gables. Crockets. Twisting chimneys. Nothing clever in the commentary, no puns, no Wildean witticisms. No apposite aper\u00e7us. Nary an \"innit\"; just a lacing of old-fashioned charm, natural good manners and loosely bridled class. </p> <p>That was Alec Clifton-Taylor and his Six English Towns series, made for the BBC quite some years ago. I still think these programmes are some of the best made on architecture, buildings and places, because I learned so much from them, liked their lack of pretension, their quiet passion and Clifton-Taylor's great ability as a communicator. No wilful obfuscation, yet absolutely no dumbing down. Learning worn lightly by a kind, grandfatherly figure. And no need, at least as far as I could tell, for stylists and make-up artists. </p> <p>Architecture is a notoriously difficult subject to get across on television. Always has been. The problem is simply stated. Buildings are big and don't move. Because of this, successive generations of producers have exhausted just about every trick in their technical repertory. Dramatic camera angles, melodramatic music, a presenter staring wistfully up into a dome, and, erm, more dramatic camera angles. What they tend to lack are strong storylines, memorable characters and the very human dimension that makes buildings come alive. </p> <p>Architects, to be unkind for a sentence, tend to enjoy buildings best when there are no annoying humans to spoil them. Inside every architect, you can't help thinking, is the spirit of Professor Otto Silenus, the chilling young man who rebuilds the Beste-Chetwynde house in Evelyn Waugh's delicious Decline And Fall (1926). Silenus, whose only previous work had been a rejected design for a bubble-gum factory somewhere in eastern Europe, was on a mission to rid the human element from architecture. Only reluctantly did he agree to provide a stair to link the severely proportioned floors of the new house. This was delicious, spot-on satire. Mere humans should not be allowed to mar architecture. </p> <p>Piers Gough, a likable architect with bird's nest hair, booming delivery and big, colourful glasses, spends the best part of The Shock Of The Old, a six-part series for C4, providing the human element. Gough is presented as what we call a \"character\"; he knows his stuff, from Roman to hi-tech British buildings, but wraps it up in a few too many dreadful puns and groaning jokes. These work well in conversation - Gough is an intelligent and witty man - but feel awkward on screen. Bring back Alec Clifton-Taylor, or even that paragon of no-nonsense delivery, Professor Nikolaus Pevsner. Or go to a broad church of an audience. </p> <p>Quaint to watch at the beginning of the 21st century, John Betjeman and his producers knew how to tell stories about the people who made and occupied buildings. Today, for the most part, a heavy duty falls on the presenter who has to perform like an experienced actor - the professional TV pundit who stresses too many of the wrong words, looks knowingly into the camera lens and appears to be reading with a singular lack of passion from the autocue. Clifton-Taylor and Betjeman were watchable to viewers outside the TV industry because they acted parts they had written for themselves on and off the box for many years. Nobody could play John Betjeman, the nation's battered teddy bear, better than JB himself. </p> <p>It is possible to make a TV documentary, if not perhaps a series about architecture without a presenter, but then the buildings' supporting cast must be very strong or their stories gripping. The best contemporary architectural documentary-maker is Rebecca Frayn. Frayn cannot be hurried. Her programmes are precisely cut and polished gems, seemingly reverential yet shot through with fox-like cunning. The film she made for C4 about minimalist houses, and their architects and clients, a couple of years back was magnificent: architecture stripped bare on a psychiatrist's couch. This was one of the saddest, yet most beautifully made TV films I've ever seen, wealthy people and earnest professionals colluding to design and build an architecture that was somehow meant to clear away emotional unrest and over-attachment to physical things; yet, rarely has one seen such an intensity of restless materialists. Gripping. </p> <p>The other thing an architecture programme can do, although few manage it, is to pursue a line of real argument: a polemic, in other words. This is rare because to argue about architecture in Britain is tantamount to the same thing as causing offence. Architects do not like to be criticised. When I began to write for the Architectural Review, the garrulous historian Gavin Stamp told me in stentorian terms that the only thing I needed to remember was that the \"only good architect was a dead one\". You could say what you liked about them then, even be objective. </p> <p>The Shock Of The Old is being sold as a controversy. Gough, says C4, \"sets out to remind audiences of just how modern and radical buildings were in their day, stripping away the centuries of familiarity, enabling us to see their startling boldness\". No shock there then, after all, although computer graphics, even if a little crude compared to the subtlety of the buildings they attempt to depict, are used to good effect right from the start of the series. And here is some real advance in architecture as it is shown on TV. Once Gough has got the dreadful puns out of his system in the opening sequences of \"Romans@britannia.co.uk\", it's intriguing to hear him describe the great victory arch the Romans built at Dover as a gateway to Watling Street, and thus colonised Britannia. We get to see the arch and, yes, it must have looked as shocking in its way as operatic shopping malls, built on a Roman scale, which Gough takes us to see. I liked, too, the comparison he makes between medieval cathedrals, shown here in computer-generated former glory, and the new IMAX theatre at Waterloo. Medieval cathedrals were, in a way, the Sensurround cinema or colour TV of their day. </p> <p>But what is truly controversial about The Shock Of The New is Gough's keen appreciation of some truly shocking postmodern buildings, many of which should only be visited wearing a pair of Jonathan Meades' dark glasses. Or Alec Clifton-Taylor's Viyella shirt, tweed jacket and battered hat. Can we have a repeat of Six English Towns now? </p> <p>\u0095 The Shock Of The Old, Sunday, 8pm, C4</p>",

But, he said, it would mean for the first time that the courts and probation and prison services had a consistent way of judging the likelihood that a convicted offender would strike again.</p> <p>Last night the Law Society and probation officers voiced \"deep concern\" that it would lead to sentences based not on what a criminal had done, but on who he was or what he was likely to do. The punishment would no longer fit the crime, but the criminal. It would also decide whether a defendant should be freed on bail.</p> <p>The system, developed by the Home Office, gives an offender a computerised score based on factors like unemployment, literacy, family circumstances, lifestyle, history, who they mixed with and their educational background, as well as on the criminal's attitude to his or her offence.

      "bodyText": "Every offender in Britain is to be given a computer-generated score that will tell the courts before they are sentenced how likely they are to re-offend and what danger they pose to the public, under a controversial plan to be introduced next year. The chief inspector of probation, Sir Graham Smith, said yesterday he understood that the introduction of Oasys - the offender assessment system - would not be universally welcomed, particularly by defence lawyers. But, he said, it would mean for the first time that the courts and probation and prison services had a consistent way of judging the likelihood that a convicted offender would strike again. Last night the Law Society and probation officers voiced \"deep concern\" that it would lead to sentences based not on what a criminal had done, but on who he was or what he was likely to do. The punishment would no longer fit the crime, but the criminal. It would also decide whether a defendant should be freed on bail. The system, developed by the Home Office, gives an offender a computerised score based on factors like unemployment, literacy, family circumstances, lifestyle, history, who they mixed with and their educational background, as well as on the criminal's attitude to his or her offence. A computer would analyse the results and produce a score to enable an experienced probation officer to predict how likely the person was to re-offend. It is not expected the reports would contain a raw figure suggesting, for instance, that a particular burglar had a 90% likelihood of committing the crime again. Rather, the courts would be told whether there was a high, medium or low risk that particular criminals would re-offend, and how dangerous their crimes were likely to be. Sir Graham Smith said that Oasys would not replace the judgment and gut instincts of probation officers, but would allow their reports, on which the courts based their sentencing, to be less subjective. \"We have to be more consistent. We have relied too much on nous, instinct and feel,\" he said. \"It will ensure the offender gets the right sentence and onto the right 'what works' programme to tackle his offending behaviour.\" More than 600,000 probation reports are written each year and used not only to decide the sentence, but also the courses criminals should be required to take and when to release them on parole or on home detention curfew. Pilot schemes are under way and the scheme is expected to be introduced nationally next year. \"There are going to be people who say they don't like it. There are going to be human rights issues, but we are not going to say 'this particular person will definitely commit a crime.' We are going to say that all these factors are going to have some kind of impact,\" said Sir Graham.",

      "bodyText": "A rocket was fired at the office of a French government representative in Corsica early yesterday, dealing another blow to government-sponsored efforts to bring peace to the Mediterranean island. Police said the attack caused no injuries and only minimal damage to the building. But the incident, attributed to separatist guerrillas, is the second challenge in as many weeks to far-reaching plans by the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, to offer Corsica an unprecedented degree of self rule in exchange for an end to a quarter-century of bloodshed. Last week Jean-Michel Rossi, a reformed Corsican nationalist, was shot dead outside a cafe in upper Corsica along with his bodyguard. Their heavily armed killers remain at large. The rocket attack took place as Mr Jospin, whose plan for Corsica has been criticised by the conservative opposition and members of his coalition as rewarding violence, said in a magazine article published yesterday that Corsicans must respect the rule of law if devolution is to go ahead. But while the political wings of the main Corsican national ist parties have voiced support for the accords, their underground military groups have yet to show themselves capable of uniting to agree on the need for peace. The plans, if passed by the French parliament, would transfer responsibility for issues such as culture, education and infrastructure to the Corsican assembly, which would also have the power to modify laws passed in Paris. If all went well, a future French government would then revise the French constitution in 2003 or 2004, introducing proportional representation and creating a single political and administrative body for Corsica with limited law-making powers. In his article, published in Le Nouvel Observateur, Mr Jospin admitted there was resistance in France to granting Corsicans legislative power, but argued that the mood may change if lasting peace returns and Corsicans make good use of their new powers. \"But if the Corsican state of mind does not change, if the island's elected representatives do not assume their responsibilities, if the violence continues, any revision of the constitution would be risky if not unjustified,\" he said.",

The document, received from Lib Dem councillor Gavin Stollar and sent on from the computer of press person Daisy Sampson, contains a joke so incorrect it might only find a market in the Alabama of the 1950s. Suffice it to say, it involves a black man, his posh white girlfriend and her appalled father - and it turns, in the way of such jokes, on a stereotypical feature of black male anatomy, and larded with pidgin English. Very plastic sandals and beards.</p> <p>\"I'm happy to take the irony route, yes,\" says Daisy, asked if spreading the joke is a pastiche of this long outmoded racial stereotype. And rumours of Bernard Manning's booking as a warm-up act for Charlie Kennedy's big leadership speech at the Lib Dem conference next month remain unconfirmed.</p> <p>\u0095 On similar territory, we return to our Book of the Month. Having explained at the start of Under No Illusion (Blake Publishing) why the word \"nigger\" is not offensive, my friend Paul Daniels makes another coded bid to succeed Gurbux Singh at the Commission for Racial Equality when he tells of a night in Bombay with the lovely Debbie McGee. The couple went to \"a nice restaurant\", he writes; \"the lamb came in a pastry-covered pot with the bones sticking out of the pastry... The smell was not good and... the meat tasted like it smelt. I didn't eat too much of it.\" Oh dear.</p> <p>The next morning Paul's guide explained. \"You ordered lamb but they did not have any lamb. They served you dog but the real problem is it was not a young dog.\" How extraordinarily credible that is of a top Bombay restaurant.</p> <p>\u0095 Sad news from the world of tourist attractions. Irene Jamieson rings from St Albans to recommend the Tomato Museum on Guernsey - but alas, alas and thrice alas, it transpires that it closed about two years ago. According to Neville in the Guernsey tourist information office, the reason - and this is the crazy bit - was that it did not attract enough visitors and, er, went to seed. Neville remembers it only as \"all right\", and recalls the tomato wine served there as \"not very pleasant\". \"One man got a \u00a3600 fine for pouring what he called 'disgusting liquid' over their electronic till.\"</p> <p>\u0095 I am captivated by a Daily Express article, \"Robbed - in the place I feel safest\", in which editor Rizla Rosie Boycott describes how, at her country place, she allowed a con-man claiming to have run out of petrol to nick her Audi. There is so much here to enjoy, but my favourite bit is Rosie trotting off obediently to the garden when the man asked if she had any lawnmower fluid. For his car. How many times have I begged her to take more tobacco with it? She wouldn't listen, and this is the result. Poor show.</p> <p>\u0095 Optimism grows regarding the recapture of Gerald Kaufman. Gerald was snatched in central London on Sunday by terrorist splinter group Real GAF (Judy Garland Appreciation Front), whose demands are for lower dress-circle prices at West End musicals. Yesterday, however, with cautious optimism, Scotland Yard negotiators said cash has become the key issue... and if the Real GAF is prepared to raise its offer, there is every chance we'll take him back again.</p> <p>\u0095 I am profoundly depressed to learn of the hypocritical and craven expulsion of Nick from Big Brother. Still, it's not all gloom for the junior insurance broker. At least his career prospects look good. Duplicitous, treacherous, neurotic, deceitful and pretty much amoral - I think we can all guess what's next. Taxi to Fleet Street, Mr Nicholas Bateman, taxi to Fleet Street...</p> <p>\u0095 Terrible scenes last Tuesday week at the Covent Gardent branch of fashion chain Monsoon. The store was closed - and we are really not making this up - because of flooding.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 A spectacularly unfunny email from Charles Kennedy's office does the rounds. The document, received from Lib Dem councillor Gavin Stollar and sent on from the computer of press person Daisy Sampson, contains a joke so incorrect it might only find a market in the Alabama of the 1950s. Suffice it to say, it involves a black man, his posh white girlfriend and her appalled father - and it turns, in the way of such jokes, on a stereotypical feature of black male anatomy, and larded with pidgin English. Very plastic sandals and beards. \"I'm happy to take the irony route, yes,\" says Daisy, asked if spreading the joke is a pastiche of this long outmoded racial stereotype. And rumours of Bernard Manning's booking as a warm-up act for Charlie Kennedy's big leadership speech at the Lib Dem conference next month remain unconfirmed. \u0095 On similar territory, we return to our Book of the Month. Having explained at the start of Under No Illusion (Blake Publishing) why the word \"nigger\" is not offensive, my friend Paul Daniels makes another coded bid to succeed Gurbux Singh at the Commission for Racial Equality when he tells of a night in Bombay with the lovely Debbie McGee. The couple went to \"a nice restaurant\", he writes; \"the lamb came in a pastry-covered pot with the bones sticking out of the pastry... The smell was not good and... the meat tasted like it smelt. I didn't eat too much of it.\" Oh dear. The next morning Paul's guide explained. \"You ordered lamb but they did not have any lamb. They served you dog but the real problem is it was not a young dog.\" How extraordinarily credible that is of a top Bombay restaurant. \u0095 Sad news from the world of tourist attractions. Irene Jamieson rings from St Albans to recommend the Tomato Museum on Guernsey - but alas, alas and thrice alas, it transpires that it closed about two years ago. According to Neville in the Guernsey tourist information office, the reason - and this is the crazy bit - was that it did not attract enough visitors and, er, went to seed. Neville remembers it only as \"all right\", and recalls the tomato wine served there as \"not very pleasant\". \"One man got a \u00a3600 fine for pouring what he called 'disgusting liquid' over their electronic till.\" \u0095 I am captivated by a Daily Express article, \"Robbed - in the place I feel safest\", in which editor Rizla Rosie Boycott describes how, at her country place, she allowed a con-man claiming to have run out of petrol to nick her Audi. There is so much here to enjoy, but my favourite bit is Rosie trotting off obediently to the garden when the man asked if she had any lawnmower fluid. For his car. How many times have I begged her to take more tobacco with it? She wouldn't listen, and this is the result. Poor show. \u0095 Optimism grows regarding the recapture of Gerald Kaufman. Gerald was snatched in central London on Sunday by terrorist splinter group Real GAF (Judy Garland Appreciation Front), whose demands are for lower dress-circle prices at West End musicals. Yesterday, however, with cautious optimism, Scotland Yard negotiators said cash has become the key issue... and if the Real GAF is prepared to raise its offer, there is every chance we'll take him back again. \u0095 I am profoundly depressed to learn of the hypocritical and craven expulsion of Nick from Big Brother. Still, it's not all gloom for the junior insurance broker. At least his career prospects look good. Duplicitous, treacherous, neurotic, deceitful and pretty much amoral - I think we can all guess what's next. Taxi to Fleet Street, Mr Nicholas Bateman, taxi to Fleet Street... \u0095 Terrible scenes last Tuesday week at the Covent Gardent branch of fashion chain Monsoon. The store was closed - and we are really not making this up - because of flooding.",

First, given the government's claims about winning the battle against poverty, why was there a huge increase in the number of people needing to make budgeting loan applications to the social fund? Second, what does it say about benefit levels that the DSS rejected 360,000 applications because applicants were \"too poor\" to repay? And third, what does the government think happens to those who are rejected? It commands \"work from those who can\" and allegedly offers \"security for those who cannot\". Not much sign of security here.</p> <p><b>Steve Webb MP</b> <br>Liberal Democrat social security spokesman</p> <p>\u0095 The response of Angela Eagle to Malcolm Dean's criticisms of the social fund is bland in the extreme. She does not discuss the point that applications from poor people for loans are increasing at the very time New Labour is boasting of tackling poverty. She fails to consider what happens to those whose applications are rejected. And she ignores the accusation that, in opposition, Labour condemned social fund loans and called for their replacement by grants.</p> <p><b>Bob Holman</b> <br>Glasgow</p> <p>\u0095 As a someone who exists on incapacity benefit because of renal failure since birth, I applied for a budgeting loan of \u00a3210, on the advice of the benefits agency, only to be told that I was not entitled to one as I was not on jobseeker's allowance or income support. I don't want to keep the money or to make a fortune speculating on international currency. I just want a loan to get my Mini through its MoT, so I can get to hospital for dialysis and to Hull University to study. So much for New Labour's philosophy of empowerment.</p> <p><b>Mark Hallam</b> <br>Hull</p> <p>\u0095 Social assistance benefit rates in this country were always alleged to be sufficient for food, clothing, fuel and other basic necessities. Because this made replacement of expensive durables difficult, the system used to include a \"single-payment\" grant scheme. But in 1988, the then government decreed that in future benefit rates would be enough to repay loans for essential items, even though benefits were not to be increased. Angela Eagle ducks this issue. A system of grants should be restored until benefits are high enough to permit claimants to repay loans for necessities without suffering hardship.</p> <p><b> Geoff Fimister</b> <br>Child Poverty Action Group</p>",

She does not discuss the point that applications from poor people for loans are increasing at the very time New Labour is boasting of tackling poverty. She fails to consider what happens to those whose applications are rejected. And she ignores the accusation that, in opposition, Labour condemned social fund loans and called for their replacement by grants. Bob Holman Glasgow \u0095 As a someone who exists on incapacity benefit because of renal failure since birth, I applied for a budgeting loan of \u00a3210, on the advice of the benefits agency, only to be told that I was not entitled to one as I was not on jobseeker's allowance or income support. I don't want to keep the money or to make a fortune speculating on international currency. I just want a loan to get my Mini through its MoT, so I can get to hospital for dialysis and to Hull University to study. So much for New Labour's philosophy of empowerment. Mark Hallam Hull \u0095 Social assistance benefit rates in this country were always alleged to be sufficient for food, clothing, fuel and other basic necessities. Because this made replacement of expensive durables difficult, the system used to include a \"single-payment\" grant scheme. But in 1988, the then government decreed that in future benefit rates would be enough to repay loans for essential items, even though benefits were not to be increased. Angela Eagle ducks this issue. A system of grants should be restored until benefits are high enough to permit claimants to repay loans for necessities without suffering hardship. Geoff Fimister Child Poverty Action Group",

Over the next three years public spending on railways will increase by 125% in real terms compared to an 18% real-terms increase in spending on trunk roads and motorways. The transport plan commits a total of \u00a360bn to the railways over the next 10 years. Nearly half the money, \u00a326bn, will come from the public sector in operating subsidies and capital grants. The rest will be made up from a mixture of fare revenue and private finance, the latter being backed by future income from fares and an extra \u00a33.5bn of direct revenue support from the public purse.</p> <p>But should taxpayers get more for their money: a stake in the industry? In part, this question was answered in the announcement of the first two new passenger franchises, a 20-year replacement franchise for Chiltern Railways, which runs trains between London and the West Midlands, and a two-year extension to the Midland Main Line franchise.

The replacement for Connex South Central, also in the first tranche, has been held up by the incumbent operator's unwillingness to give up the franchise before it expires in 2003.</p> <p>But the question of whether the public sector should also acquire not just a share in the profits but also a stake in the ownership of the industry and in particular in Railtrack, the monopoly owner of the infrastructure, remains. The idea of a public sector equity stake in Railtrack in return for government grant was put forward by Labour in opposition. Today, some 90% of Railtrack's income comes in the form of payments made by the passenger and freight operators for use of the infrastructure.

Addressing the crowd in Pershing Square, surrounded by hundreds of police, Biafra told demonstrators that \"corporate power is the new Vietnam\". The gathering came at the end of a day of arrests and marches and the firing of rubber bullets on a crowd outside the centre where the convention is being held. The police declared unlawful assemblies for the second time this week to disperse protesters who had gathered on the issues of police brutality and the death penalty. So far 192 people have been arrested, 59 for felonies and 133 for misdemeanors. \"Do you want to be part of history or do you want to watch it on television?\" asked Biafra who is in dispute with former members of his group because he refused to allow Levis to use a Dead Kennedys song for a commercial. \"Above all, don't give up, don't turn into yuppies like the last generation!\" He urged people to vote for the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader. The day started with 30 people being arrested outside Rampart police station, which is at the centre of a corruption scandal involving officers dealing in and planting drugs, shooting unarmed gang members and fabricating evidence. A larger march of around 4,000 people then rallied outside the LAPD's headquarters to protest about people killed by police. A lorry with the names of 2,000 who had been killed throughout the US was at the centre of a march which nearly boiled over after a masked anarchist set fire to the American flag.",

When that was disproved, subsequent leaks portrayed him as an unbalanced sex maniac who harassed women in hotels.</p> <p>Although the American national transportation safety board (NTSB) has not yet reached a conclusion about the cause, last Friday it released the first 1,665 pages of documents relating to the crash - including the first full transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder.</p> <p>Far from confirming the suicide theory, the transcript shows Batouti cooperating with the captain after his hasty return to the cockpit in an effort to save the plane.</p> <p>Twenty-eight minutes into the flight, and two minutes before the crash, with Batouti in charge in the cockpit, there are sounds described as a thunk and a click. The voice recorder then captures three syllables of non-Arabic speech. Four of the 10 people involved in the transcription believe they heard words similar to \"control it\"; one thought it might be \"hydraulic\"; five say it is unintelligible.</p> <p>Immediately after this, Batouti says faintly: \" tawakilt ala Allah \" (I rely on God) - a phrase he repeats 10 times before the recording breaks off.</p> <p>The American suicide theory was based on the fact that Batouti uttered this phrase, routinely used by Egyptians facing difficult situations, before the autopilot was disengaged and the engines shut off.</p> <p>There is also nothing in the transcript to support earlier American claims that the captain, Ahmed Mahmoud al-Habashi, and Batouti fought for control of the plane.</p> <p>In the transcript, Batouti asks: \"What's happening?\" but there is no suggestion that Batouti has done something wrong or is not working to save the plane.</p> <p>Leaks from the investigation earlier also suggested that Batouti switched off the engines to prevent Habashi pulling the plane out of its dive. But the Egyptian Pilots' Association says the crew were following standard procedure in order to slow the aircraft's speed. In the transcript, Habashi orders Batouti: \"Shut the engines\". Batouti replies: \"It's shut\".</p> <p>In the space of 40 seconds, the plane descended from 33,000ft to 16,000ft before the voice recorder cut off.</p> <p>On the basis of radar observations, US investigators say that it later climbed to 24,000 feet before finally dropping into the sea. The Egyptian Pilots' Association claims this is another error.</p> <p>Ali Murad, the association's deputy secretary general, says: \"If the engines were switched off during the dive, how did the plane manage to climb up to 24,000 feet again? What was seen at 24,000 feet were remains of the plane which fell more slowly than the main part.\"</p> <p>Before the NTSB's release of documents, the American paper USA Today published leaks from an FBI investigation in which security staff at the New York hotel used by EgyptAir crews alleged that there had been complaints about Batouti exposing himself from behind a window, and that he had harassed chambermaids. None of these incidents was reported to police at the time, and there were statements from other hotel workers describing Batouti as a pleasant man who caused no trouble.</p> <p>To the co-pilot's nephew, Walid Batouti, the latest leaks \"all confirm the conspiracy being made against Batouti and EgyptAir\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Egypt yesterday claimed vindication in the latest round of the politically charged investigation into the crash of EgyptAir flight 990, which plunged into the sea off Massachusetts last October, killing 217 people. American investigators believe that the 59-year-old co-pilot, Gamil al-Batouti, deliberately pushed the aircraft into a fatal dive when the captain left the controls to go to the toilet. But yesterday Mohammed Fahim Rayan, EgyptAir's chairman, said he was \"99% sure\" that a technical problem, not a suicidal pilot, had caused the Boeing 767 to crash. Earlier this week, Boeing urged all airlines flying the wide-bodied 767 to make special checks on the bell cranks - mechanical links from the hydraulic controls that help to move the elevator flaps on the tail. Boeing denied any connection with the crash investigation, but EgyptAir was delighted. \"This is exactly what we've been talking about,\" said Captain Shaker Kelada, the airline's safety chief. Bell cranks retrieved from the wreckage of flight 990 were found to have rivets sheared in opposite directions, which EgyptAir says may indicate that the elevators - controlling the up and down attitude of the plane - jammed. \"We have seen at least two similar complaints from the Boeing's 767 elevators by Air Canada and Air Mexico,\" Walid Murad, head of the Egyptian Pilots' Federation, said. Egypt has always rejected the suicide theory, suggesting that investigators latched on to the theory to exonerate Boeing from any part in the disaster. A series of leaks to the American press during the early stages of the investigation sought to portray Batouti as an Islamic fundamentalist. When that was disproved, subsequent leaks portrayed him as an unbalanced sex maniac who harassed women in hotels. Although the American national transportation safety board (NTSB) has not yet reached a conclusion about the cause, last Friday it released the first 1,665 pages of documents relating to the crash - including the first full transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder. Far from confirming the suicide theory, the transcript shows Batouti cooperating with the captain after his hasty return to the cockpit in an effort to save the plane. Twenty-eight minutes into the flight, and two minutes before the crash, with Batouti in charge in the cockpit, there are sounds described as a thunk and a click. The voice recorder then captures three syllables of non-Arabic speech. Four of the 10 people involved in the transcription believe they heard words similar to \"control it\"; one thought it might be \"hydraulic\"; five say it is unintelligible. Immediately after this, Batouti says faintly: \" tawakilt ala Allah \" (I rely on God) - a phrase he repeats 10 times before the recording breaks off. The American suicide theory was based on the fact that Batouti uttered this phrase, routinely used by Egyptians facing difficult situations, before the autopilot was disengaged and the engines shut off. There is also nothing in the transcript to support earlier American claims that the captain, Ahmed Mahmoud al-Habashi, and Batouti fought for control of the plane. In the transcript, Batouti asks: \"What's happening?\" but there is no suggestion that Batouti has done something wrong or is not working to save the plane. Leaks from the investigation earlier also suggested that Batouti switched off the engines to prevent Habashi pulling the plane out of its dive. But the Egyptian Pilots' Association says the crew were following standard procedure in order to slow the aircraft's speed. In the transcript, Habashi orders Batouti: \"Shut the engines\". Batouti replies: \"It's shut\". In the space of 40 seconds, the plane descended from 33,000ft to 16,000ft before the voice recorder cut off. On the basis of radar observations, US investigators say that it later climbed to 24,000 feet before finally dropping into the sea. The Egyptian Pilots' Association claims this is another error. Ali Murad, the association's deputy secretary general, says: \"If the engines were switched off during the dive, how did the plane manage to climb up to 24,000 feet again? What was seen at 24,000 feet were remains of the plane which fell more slowly than the main part.\" Before the NTSB's release of documents, the American paper USA Today published leaks from an FBI investigation in which security staff at the New York hotel used by EgyptAir crews alleged that there had been complaints about Batouti exposing himself from behind a window, and that he had harassed chambermaids. None of these incidents was reported to police at the time, and there were statements from other hotel workers describing Batouti as a pleasant man who caused no trouble. To the co-pilot's nephew, Walid Batouti, the latest leaks \"all confirm the conspiracy being made against Batouti and EgyptAir\".",

It was a speech that set out to do four things: introduce the still largely unknown Mr Lieberman to a wider national audience; help promote Al Gore's generally lack-lustre public image; win the enthusiastic support of the black American electorate, a crucial Democratic base; and reach out to independent and undecided voters who need reasons to cast their ballots for the Gore-Lieberman ticket. \"Let me just speak to those of you at home who haven't made up your mind if you want to build on our prosperity,\" Mr Lieberman said, before highlighting bipartisanship and political reform as two key areas appealing to independents. \"I respectfully say to you that Al Gore and I are the guys who are ready to do the job,\" the vice-presidential candidate said.

The senator's quirky and unconventional voting record has raised some questions - especially among black leaders - about whether he will win over their support. In two warm-up speeches, Congressmen Robert Menendez, a Latino from New Jersey, and the formidable John Lewis of Georgia, a black man, fought to promote Mr Lieberman's anti-racist record. Meanwhile, Mr Lieberman went out of his way to restate his support for affirmative action, as he had done earlier at a meeting with the congressional black caucus. Mr Lewis reminded the convention that the young Mr Lieberman had travelled to America's deep south to help register black voters during the toughest years of the civil rights campaigns of the 1960s. Mr Lewis called him: \"My friend and my brother.\" The impact that the man from Connecticut has made on the polls in just a few days has been good for the Democrats, and yesterday's speech has established him quickly as a formidable player in the political big league.

      "bodyText": "Senator John McCain was consulting doctors in Arizona yesterday after revealing that he has suffered a recurrence of the most dangerous form of skin cancer. The Arizona senator's office announced that doctors had found two spots of melanoma, on his left arm and left temple. He underwent an operation in 1993 to remove an earlier melanoma from his shoulder. Since then, friends say, he has had check-ups every three months. The latest tests were taken earlier this month. The former contender for the Republican presidential nomination has cancelled most of his immediate public engagements, though he intends to honour a commitment to appear in Ohio on Sunday on behalf of a colleague. The treatments available will depend on the depth of the cancer and whether it has spread. Independent medical experts said yesterday that there was a chance that the latest cancer was treatable because it had been caught early. Mr McCain's news brought tributes from friends and rivals. \"John is a good man and a fighter,\" George W Bush said, recalling the strength of a man who spent five years in a Vietnamese prison. \"He is so courageous he will just face it,\" the Democratic contender, Al Gore, said.",

An oil price riding above $30 is bound to increase pressure to use less energy and to act as a brake on economic growth. </p> <p>It may also stimulate the oil industry - which restructured to cope with a $10 a barrel price - to open up exploration and development and bring more production on stream. </p> <p>Opec has other problems, one of which is in maintaining its unity.

Ten FTSE 100 companies now offer money purchase schemes exclusively - all of them in the technology, media and telecoms sector - while a further seven have closed their final salary schemes to new staff, according to the survey from consulting actuary firm Lane Clark &amp; Peacock. A third of FTSE 100 companies now offer money purchase arrangements - also known as defined contribution schemes - to at least some of their staff, despite many experts believing that final salary schemes offer workers a better deal because they guarantee a certain level of pension benefits at retirement. Money purchase schemes - where the value of the pension is determined by how much is put in and investment performance on the markets - offer no such guarantees. \"We expect that the trend to defined contribution will continue - already ICI has announced its decision to close its final salary scheme to new entrants,\" said Richard Abramson, a partner at Lane Clark &amp; Peacock. Employers are often using the change as an excuse to reduce their pension costs, but he added: \"The down side is increased uncertainty and volatility for the employee, who is far less able to bear the risks of stock market fluctuations than large companies.\" The 10 FTSE 100 companies offering only money purchase arrangements include firms such as ARM Holdings, BSkyB, Energis, Logica, Misys, Reuters and Telewest. The survey also criticised some companies - including Abbey National and BP Amoco - for disclosing \"inadequate\" information about pension and redundancy costs in their accounts, based on its study of the workings of the SSAP 24 accounting standard.",

He had a distinguished record as a sub-mariner in the second world war, the start of a career which, in the words of one Guardian writer - in an article prompted by one of the rare occasions when Duff's name surfaced in public - achieved the difficult trick of staying submerged during much of its long public service.</p> <p>It was this trait, when he was a 24-year-old submarine commander, that earned Duff a place in naval legend, after an ingenious escape off Norway during the second world war.

His achievement was recognised by a DSO.</p> <p>But his eyes had been damaged in the action and, after the war, he abandoned his hopes of a naval career to join the Foreign Office, serving in Cairo, Paris, Bonn, Kuala Lumpur, and as ambassador to Nepal in 1964. He became high commissioner in Kenya at a time when the Rhodesia crisis was poisoning relations with other African commonwealth countries. In 1975, he was brought back to London as head of the Foreign Office's Africa department.</p> <p>Duff was about to retire at a crucial period in the Zimbabwean independence negotiations at Lancaster House, which at last brought agreement in 1979. His long experience and calmness persuaded Mrs Thatcher to appoint him to the post of deputy governor in Salisbury (now Harare), under Christopher Soames. While Duff was credited with doing much of the backroom work, and bringing the white Rhodesian military commander, Peter Wallis, to heel, he was also said to have backed the moderate Bishop Abel Muzorewa in the British effort to keep the principal guerrilla leader, Robert Mugabe, out of power.</p> <p>Elections were finally held in March 1980, and Zimbabwean independence came the following month. Soames and Duff returned to Britain, and Duff retired from the diplomatic service after 34 years. But he was at once appointed to coordinate the activities of the security and intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, the government communications headquarters at Cheltenham.</p> <p>Occasionally, an unforeseen event might provoke real debate within the joint intelligence committee (JIC), of which Duff was a member, both as coordinator and, later, as director general of MI5. Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power in the 1980s was such a case. Duff and Sir Derek Boorman, chief of defence intelligence, took the view that the Soviet leader's proposals for internal reform and deep cuts in missile stocks seemed genuine. Sir Percy Cradock, then chairman of the JIC, disagreed. As far as he was concerned, Moscow was still aiming at communist domination of the world - and he won the argument in committee.</p> <p>In 1985, the affair of Michael Bettaney, the young MI5 officer caught trying to pass secrets to the Soviet embassy in London, led to a scathing attack on MI5's top management by the security commission. Cathy Massiter resigned from MI5 to disclose how the agency had monitored trade union leaders and dissenting groups - including CND and the National Council for Civil Liberties - because it regarded them as \"subversives\".</p> <p>At the age of 65, Duff accepted the unenviable task of trying to shake MI5 up, replacing Sir John Jones, the first director general to have spent his career in the agency's F branch, responsible for domestic subversion. He steered the organisation towards combating more relevant targets, including Northern Irish terrorism.</p> <p>He began to open up MI5 to discreet contacts with the media, and persuaded Mrs Thatcher to appoint an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints by secret service employees. When, in 1987, she stopped BBC Radio 4 from broadcasting My Country Right Or Wrong, a series about democractic accountability in the security and intelligence services, Duff told his staff there was nothing in the programmes to worry about.</p> <p>However, his role - and his previous career as an outsider - was resented by older members of the MI5 hierarchy. The younger generation of security service officers, including many women, also believed that, while he recognised the problem, Duff failed to get rid of the unpopular, male-dominated, old guard.</p> <p>Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, conceded during a Commons debate at the end of 1986 - provoked by the Peter Wright Spycatcher trial in Australia - that an internal complaints procedure, recommended by the security commission, had still not been introduced.</p> <p>Mrs Thatcher's futile attempts to stop the publication of Wright's memoirs did nothing for MI5's reputation, and were probably not appreciated by Duff, who did not give evidence in the Australian courts. But the Spycatcher saga prompted another internal Whitehall inquiry, also headed by Duff, into allegations that a faction within MI5 had sought to discredit the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, back in the mid-1970s. Mrs Thatcher told MPs that Duff found \"no evidence of any truth\" in the allegations, although at least one former senior official, who was embroiled in the whole affair, has said since that he was not even questioned.</p> <p>By 1987, Duff had had enough of Whitehall intrigue and retired for the third and last time. He then turned to a most unusual activity for a former senior diplomat, and started work at a day-centre for the homeless, making and serving tea. Known simply as Tony Duff, he devoted the next five years of his life to being a member of the board of London's Homeless Network.</p> <p>Duff was knighted in 1980. He married Pauline Sword in 1944. They had a son, two daughters and a stepson.</p> <p>\u0095 Arthur Antony Duff, diplomat, intelligence officer and worker for the homeless, born February 25 1920; died August 13 2000</p>",

Cathy Massiter resigned from MI5 to disclose how the agency had monitored trade union leaders and dissenting groups - including CND and the National Council for Civil Liberties - because it regarded them as \"subversives\". At the age of 65, Duff accepted the unenviable task of trying to shake MI5 up, replacing Sir John Jones, the first director general to have spent his career in the agency's F branch, responsible for domestic subversion. He steered the organisation towards combating more relevant targets, including Northern Irish terrorism. He began to open up MI5 to discreet contacts with the media, and persuaded Mrs Thatcher to appoint an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints by secret service employees. When, in 1987, she stopped BBC Radio 4 from broadcasting My Country Right Or Wrong, a series about democractic accountability in the security and intelligence services, Duff told his staff there was nothing in the programmes to worry about. However, his role - and his previous career as an outsider - was resented by older members of the MI5 hierarchy. The younger generation of security service officers, including many women, also believed that, while he recognised the problem, Duff failed to get rid of the unpopular, male-dominated, old guard. Douglas Hurd, then home secretary, conceded during a Commons debate at the end of 1986 - provoked by the Peter Wright Spycatcher trial in Australia - that an internal complaints procedure, recommended by the security commission, had still not been introduced. Mrs Thatcher's futile attempts to stop the publication of Wright's memoirs did nothing for MI5's reputation, and were probably not appreciated by Duff, who did not give evidence in the Australian courts. But the Spycatcher saga prompted another internal Whitehall inquiry, also headed by Duff, into allegations that a faction within MI5 had sought to discredit the then Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson, back in the mid-1970s. Mrs Thatcher told MPs that Duff found \"no evidence of any truth\" in the allegations, although at least one former senior official, who was embroiled in the whole affair, has said since that he was not even questioned. By 1987, Duff had had enough of Whitehall intrigue and retired for the third and last time. He then turned to a most unusual activity for a former senior diplomat, and started work at a day-centre for the homeless, making and serving tea. Known simply as Tony Duff, he devoted the next five years of his life to being a member of the board of London's Homeless Network. Duff was knighted in 1980. He married Pauline Sword in 1944. They had a son, two daughters and a stepson. \u0095 Arthur Antony Duff, diplomat, intelligence officer and worker for the homeless, born February 25 1920; died August 13 2000",

For a while, he watched Ware reading but, when the train reached Woking, he could keep silent no more. \"Young man, is that Hansard you are reading?\" asked the super-intelligent Berrill. \"Obviously,\" replied the super-intelligent Ware. \"You can see the name at the top.\" And he went on reading.</p> <p>Critics of Mensa might see, in that brief conversation, the essence of many of the organisation's future problems - the clumsy attempt at human contact brushed off gracelessly by an assertion of superior cleverness. But both men, it turned out, were more interested in organising the cerebrally clever than the astute or emotionally literate: before the train reached Godalming, Berrill had told Ware about his brother at Oxford, and his own failure to get there; about his efforts to form a movement to persuade men to wear brighter coloured clothes, and, in particular, about his passion for intelligence testing.</p> <p>A lawyer by training, Berrill was, at this stage, chiefly interested in measuring intelligence by phrenology, the study of bumps and recesses on the head. Ware argued that intelligence tests were a more scientific way forward. He had made such tests as a medical researcher during the war, and had been influenced by the work of Sir Cyril Burt, who had concluded that intelligence might have a racial basis. (Burt, of course, became a hate figure of the left and was exposed as a faker.) Before they parted, Ware invited Berrill to Oxford to discuss their ideas further.</p> <p>The fact that Ware gave Berrill himself some intelligence tests at his lodgings - and pronounced his new friend to be in the top 1% of those he had examined - perhaps indicated that he was not as unworldly as he may have appeared. Berrill reportedly burst into tears, sobbing that it was the first time anyone had ever pronounced him good at anything.</p> <p>Soon, Berrill's coffers, as well as his tear ducts, were opened. Their baby, Mensa, was born in 1946, its aim being to assess people's high intelligence and inquire into what things such people had in common.</p> <p>Whatever the truth about the balance of influence between the two men, it is certain that Ware was a co-founder. He remained an idiosyncratic figure, often at odds with the organisation, and whose interest in it waxed and waned, according to whether he agreed with the current leadership or not. He always used the title Dr, which was based on a PhD rather than any medical qualification.</p> <p>Victor Serebriakoff, an international honorary president of Mensa, remembered asking everyone at one meeting to define themselves in terms of class. All those who considered themselves working class were to raise their hands, then those who thought they were middle class, and, finally, those who regarded themselves as upper class. The only hand that went up for the upper class call was Ware's.</p> <p>Serebriakoff reflected: \"Personally, I think that he and Berrill felt they had formed Mensa to re-justify the aristocracy, but when they looked at the members coming in, it didn't turn out to be like that at all.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Mensa's attempts to broaden its social base often had inconclusive, sometimes tragic, results. In 1974, Wilf Middleton, an RAF corporal with an IQ of 160-plus (the Mensa minimum was 148), became the organisation's first blue-collar chairman. Within months, he had left the RAF pleading victimisation, quit a job with an amusements firm as a protest against the exploitation of the workers - and committed suicide. A truly intelligent man would never, of course, have got himself into such a tragic situation.</p> <p>Ware's faith was more long-lasting, though periodically dented by officers he did not agree with. As early as the 1950s, when Mensa had only 150 members - and Berrill pulled out, disillusioned and dying shortly afterwards - Ware left as well. But he rejoined in the 1960s, and helped British Mensa, the forerunner of branches in many countries, to expand into a membership of thousands.</p> <p>Certainly, his professional activities showed a more practical grip than that of many Mensa members. After Steyning grammar school and the Royal College of Science, where he got his BSc and PhD, and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he got an MA, he became a lecturer in biochemistry at St Thomas's hospital medical school, from 1941 to 1946.

      "body": "<p>When you're a 5ft 11in ex-model who made her mark as a seductive assassin in GoldenEye, a rather particular Hollywood route might seem inevitable. Famke Janssen, however, has failed - or succeeded, depending on which way you look at it - to fulfil the expected role.</p> <p>She has starred in a number of indie films but could hardly be described as alternative; she has added glamour to box office blockbusters but doesn't play the same character in vehicles tailored to her requirements. She's an actress, in other words, making the most of what comes along - but most actresses don't look like supermodels, and even fewer supermodels could ever be true actresses. </p> <p>Her latest film brings these disparate elements together. X-Men is a special-effects-drenched blizzard of a movie that uses its premise - a group of mutant superheroes who must learn to use their special powers for good while dealing with the fear they inspire from normal humans - as an allegory for prejudice. It is smart and exciting, but based as it is on the comic book of the same name, and given the track record of comic-based films, it could have been a dangerous choice for a woman keen to establish herself as a proper actress. </p> <p>\"But you take into consideration that Bryan Singer is the director and you eliminate some of that risk,\" says Janssen of her decision to play the part of Dr Jean Grey, the mutant learning to hone her telekenic skills under the tutelage of Professor Xavier, the X-Men's shiny-pated mentor. Singer made his mark with the indie hit The Usual Suspects, which attracted Janssen to the project. \"I'm a firm believer in taking risks in life, because you'll never get anywhere unless you do, and the more risk involved the greater the outcome - or the worse, but you never know so you've got to go for it. </p> <p>\"Comic books have been done in a very over the top, unreal manner in the past, but given my knowledge of comics - and I'm not a fan of them at all - it's actually a dark, alienated world. That's never been brought to the screen before, but that's exactly what most readers of The X-Men are interested in, because they're so often outsiders in one way or another too. And so I thought that if Bryan Singer could bring any of that tone and darkness and realism to the X-Men, that would make a great movie. And it did.\" </p> <p>Janssen was actually born in Holland, and came from Amsterdam to work as a model in the US in her early 20s. In some respects, she's a modern version of Audrey Hepburn - another Dutch model who broke into Hollywood. She gave up modelling to study at Columbia University, and struggled to find acting jobs for four years after graduating before landing the female lead in GoldenEye, as Xenia Onatopp, the Russian assassin and nemesis to Pierce Brosnan's 007.</p> <p>Since then she has wavered between bids for indie credibility (City of Industry, Woody Allen's Celebrity) and mainstream horror (Deep Rising, House On Haunted Hill); critical successes (The Faculty) and all-round embarrassments (Circus). She's now 35 and a jobbing actress: not so high-profile that she can call the shots like Hollywood's half-dozen leading ladies, but respected enough to work with some very good directors. </p> <p>\"With a lot of studio movies, you can't really base your decision to be involved or not on a script, because there are a lot of things that are left in flux. Working on a film for six months, you never know what scenes they're going to keep, so you have no idea on what the outcome will be.\" </p> <p>The first consideration in Janssen's career-path decison-making is always the director. \"Working with Woody Allen on Celebrity was a milestone for me because he's such a hero of mine, and I've always preferred working on character-driven projects, but I have to say, a movie like The Faculty I did because the director was Robert Rodriguez and he's a great film-maker.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter what the genre is. I'd never condemn horror, for example; one of my favourite directors of all time is Stanley Kubrick, and he made The Shining. How much input the director has and who he is is the most important thing. With all the unknowns going on, you want to give yourself up to someone who knows what he's doing. I'll probably go back and forth doing different movies, and I've just worked with a first time director [on Love &amp; Sex] because I loved the script so much, but at this point in my career working with great directors is probably the major goal.\" </p> <p>Janssen underlines a fact that rarely gets talked about: that a decision to work on a certain movie is partly based on what that working experience is going to be like. X-Men involved six months of shooting on location in Canada, after all.</p> <p>\"It's always different. Woody Allen, for example, is not one to praise anybody, and he can be very critical. He can come out with something with a remark which makes you go: 'Ow. OK, I get it, I suck.' He's brutally honest at times, and at other times he doesn't speak, and he doesn't let you know what else is going on in the film. Robert Altman, on the other hand, who I worked with on The Gingerbread Man, is the director who indulges actors. He'll let them improvise and do take after take. I couldn't say which is the better experience - it's all interesting.\" </p> <p>The trappings of fame do, of course, have to take a back seat when you're going to travel down such a winding road. Before receiving the star treatment on the X-Men, Janssen had just shot Love &amp; Sex, a micro-budgeted romantic comedy by Valerie Breiman which gave the actress her first starring role, as a magazine writer who has to prove that she can write a good article about relationships and in order to do so trawls through her history of disastrous ones.</p> <p>\"It was hysterical and I loved working on it, and with Jon Favreau, who stars as the woman's long-term boyfriend. That was one of my best experiences. There were 21 days to shoot Love &amp; Sex, and six months for the X-Men. So I was doing a movie where we shot five or six scenes a day, and because I have to play all different ages it was constant make-up changes, wardrobe changes, hair changes, with never a quiet moment and pages and pages of dialogue to do.</p> <p>\"Then all of a sudden I arrived in Toronto, and I was sitting around, saying, 'What are we doing? Shouldn't we be working?' I'd be called in at five in the morning, spend two hours having hair and make-up done, and then they'd say, 'Actually, we've decided to shoot another scene. We'll come back to you'. It just felt like it took forever to get anything accomplished. On Love &amp; Sex I got in trouble if I went to the bathroom.\" </p> <p>Janssen has chosen to live in New York over LA, emphasises that quality of life is more important than career profile, and hasn't fallen for the celebrity life - \"I don't care for all that stuff, if you want to do good work it doesn't matter where you stay or what you sleep on\" - but she's still a movie star as well as an actress, and has to play the part.</p> <p>\"It's a completely different role which you just don't realise belongs to the job. You wake up in the morning and do interviews for the whole day, then you get on a plane and you don't even know where or when you're meant to sleep. It means a lot of travelling, and a lot of talking about yourself. After a while you feel: can't we talk about something else?\" </p> <p>Janssen likes her role as Dr Jean Grey. \"She's a very normal person. The thing that I liked is this sense of control that all the X-Men have to have. When you have these special powers you'd better be able to control them well or a lot of things can go wrong. And she's just not that good at it yet. They're all superheroes, but they have flaws.\"</p> <p>Perfectly groomed Hollywood stars can make mistakes too, after all. Anyone who has seen Circus would have to agree that one thing Famke Janssen doesn't share with her character is a gift for ESP. \"I know. Like I said, sometimes you just don't know. You can say, the next time it won't happen, but it probably will. You've got to take risks.\"</p> <p>\u0095 X-Men is released today. Love &amp; Sex is released September 29.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Patrice Ch\u00e9reau wanted to display human nature at its most intense, self-absorbed, tormented and vindictive, he hired a couple of carriages from French railways, packed his characters in and sent them shuttling backwards and forwards between Paris and Mulhouse. Unlike Murder on the Orient Express, the assaults (emotional only) took place in real travelling conditions. </p> <p>Using natural light, the camera operator was jammed into the corridor; the microphone was on Ch\u00e9reau's shoulder, the continuity girl crouched behind his legs and when the camera had to do a 180 pan, everyone had to duck. \"We did it because of the landscape and the movement of the train,\" Ch\u00e9reau explained. \"You cannot really fabricate the movement of a train in a studio - the actors and the camera moving at the same time. We needed to have the real energy of that journey. </p> <p>\"We would arrive at Mulhouse a couple of hours later, uncouple the carriages, have a meal, then link the carriages to a train going back to Paris and arrive back by 6pm. We did it for 14 days. Since we did the journey so often, we knew at exactly what minute the tunnels would come.\" I pondered the notion of trains so punctual you could set your tunnels by them. </p> <p>Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train, the latest film by the French director best known as writer-director of the blood-soaked historical epic La Reine Margot, tells of a group of mourners who travel to Limoges (the real four-hour journey was inconveniently long for shooting) to the funeral of their mutual friend, Jean-Baptiste, a manipulative, homosexual artist.</p> <p>The story is inspired by the real experience of Ch\u00e9reau's film editor when she went to the funeral of the gay, manipulative, documentary film-maker, Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach seven years ago. The title is the phrase with which he summoned friends to his funeral. But woven into this is Ch\u00e9reau's painful, ambivalent tribute to his father. </p> <p>\"My father was a very good, but not very successful, painter in Angers, where I was born,\" Ch\u00e9reau said. \"His name was also Jean-Baptiste. He was completely different, but he was also a difficult man. My father was not a such a nice person. Nobody is asked to be a nice person; it is completely uninteresting to be a nice person. But he was a good teacher as is the character in the film.\" </p> <p>He chose Limoges for the second half of the story because the train journey had to be a long one, requiring effort. It turned out to be a suitable destination. Limoges is reputed to have the largest cemetery in Europe: 185,000 residents. The town has only 200,000 live ones. Ch\u00e9reau chose the unguarded moments of bereavement to access the complex relationships of his characters (played by Pascal Greggory, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi, and Jean-Louis Trintignant). Most of the relationships are homosexual; one character is transsexual. </p> <p>Was the story also based partly on Ch\u00e9reau's own experiences? \"You draw on your own gay experience,\" Ch\u00e9reau said. \"But I try not to make a gay film. I can say that I am interested in gay experiences in the sense that everything in gay life is not exactly heterosexual. But I am interested in the similarities, not in the differences. I am impressed by the fact that when you love someone, suddenly you have exactly the same problems as heterosexuals.\" </p> <p>Ch\u00e9reau is essentially a man of the theatre, where he has been a star since his 20s (he is now 55) although he has done dangerous bungee jumps with his career, like suddenly taking off to run the Piccolo theatre in Milan, putting on productions such as Lulu and Pandora's Box.</p> <p>A year later he was appointed co-director (with Roger Planchon) of the Th\u00e9tre National Populaire. Then in 1976 he did a freefall into Bayreuth, accepting an offer to put on Wagner's Ring. With the cast in tuxedos and one of the props a New York fire escape, there was a predictable scandal. But his musical director, Pierre Boulez, stood by him and he repeated the offence for two more years. </p> <p>\"I have been confronted by challenges all the time,\" he said. \"At 27, I was in Italy working in a foreign language. Then there was Bayreuth. I think I have a real taste for challenges. That is the most important thing for me - to learn what I don't know already.\" </p> <p>You could say he has something of a Napoleonic taste for conquering territories. He has the build and character for it; short, sturdy and determined (he bulldozed his recently acquired English through our interview). But when he took the risk of actually playing Napoleon, in Youssef Chahine's Adieu Bonaparte in Egypt, he, like the original, came a cropper. He admits he is \"an awful actor\". </p> <p>\"I have no pleasure in being in front of the camera,\" he said. This did not prevent him taking the role of General Montcalm in Michael Mann's Last of the Mohicans. But it carried a bonus. Isabella Adjani was with Daniel Day-Lewis at the time and was a frequent visitor to the set. He seized the opportunity to recruit her for La Reine Margot, his furiously energetic rendering of the malevolent intrigue which led to the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of Huguenots in Paris in 1572.</p> <p>It was a witches' brew of sex, butchery and extravagant pageantry which won him an international reputation. But to achieve the right level of malignancy, he had to spice Dumas's swashbuckling romance with the venom of his own 1972 production of Marlowe's The Massacre at Paris. </p> <p>It was not until 1974 that he first tackled the cinema. A consistent criticism of his work is that it shows its theatrical orgins, but his response is defiant: \"I was not born into the cinema as many French directors were, so it was a big challenge for me. But my theatre background gives me another point of view. I am happy to keep that distance\". </p> <p>This first film was La Chair de l'orchid\u00e9e, a thriller derived from a muddled novel by James Hadley Chase, author of No Orchids for Miss Blandish. \"When we signed the contract,\" Ch\u00e9reau said, \"I was shocked to discover that he was a completely fake American. He was a Swiss named Ren\u00e9 Raymond.\" [He was actually English-born.] \"I also wondered why I had such a terrible time adapting the book. Then looking at American thrillers, I realised that his were not real books at all, just compilations of cliches from American thrillers.\" </p> <p>Ch\u00e9reau did not improve matters by making it probably the wettest film in history: most of the time the characters are standing cringing under a downpour or rolling in the mud. The imperious Edwige Feuill\u00e8re of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise refused to get out of her car; she acted from the dry back seat. \"Why all the rain?\" I asked. He shrugged. \"I wrote: 'It was raining' all the time. I don't know why, I was very young.\" </p> <p>A later effort, L'Homme Bless\u00e9 (The Wounded Man, 1983), freely adapted from Jean Genet's The Thief but based on his own anguished adolescence, was a more substantial work. \"It was about this young guy of 18 discovering the world of boys. Part of the film is about adolescence and when you are doing a film about adolescence you have to look into your own life. You remember how terribly sad and confusing this time is; you don't see any escape.\" </p> <p>La Reine Margot, made in 1994, was a departure, if only because of the level of violence. \"I hate violence in real life,\" he said. \"But the world is in a continuous confrontation with violence. We began the script of Margot with the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran and finished shooting in the middle of Yugoslavia. La Reine Margot was full of that religious violence. But I am also fascinated by the violence of sentiments; the violence of love, the difficulty of love, the violence of family relationships.\" </p> <p>His latest bungee jump is to make a film in English. \"For me that is the last challenge in my life: to film in a language I had not spoken before with English actors.\" He was very taken by Hanif Kureishi's Love in a Blue Time and Intimacy (which will be its title), and with Kureishi wrote a script drawn from both books. \"I wanted to make the film in the place where he wrote them\". </p> <p>He started taking English lessons last year and from February to April he was shooting at the Elephant and Castle, Battersea and Brixton, with Mark Rylance, Timothy Spall and Marianne Faithfull. \"I really like being a European director,\" he said. \"Doing theatre in Italian, opera in German, and now English.\" He loves London but finds \"huge differences\" in the approach to working. \"The English crew work very hard,\" he said, \"but they are not interested at all in what you are doing as a director and not interested at all in French films.\" </p> <p>\"You are turning your back on Europe.\" he said, reproachfully.</p> <p>\u0095 Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train is released today.</p>",

Unlike Murder on the Orient Express, the assaults (emotional only) took place in real travelling conditions. Using natural light, the camera operator was jammed into the corridor; the microphone was on Ch\u00e9reau's shoulder, the continuity girl crouched behind his legs and when the camera had to do a 180 pan, everyone had to duck. \"We did it because of the landscape and the movement of the train,\" Ch\u00e9reau explained. \"You cannot really fabricate the movement of a train in a studio - the actors and the camera moving at the same time. We needed to have the real energy of that journey. \"We would arrive at Mulhouse a couple of hours later, uncouple the carriages, have a meal, then link the carriages to a train going back to Paris and arrive back by 6pm.

      "body": "<p>Jackie Chan, introduced as the world's \"biggest and bestest movie star\" grins as SM:TV presenter Cat Deeley whizzes questions light as frisbees at him. In between getting her to feel the hole in his skull, punctured when a stunt went near-fatally wrong, and laughing over his fear of horses, he relates how his parents nearly sold him at birth for \u00a3120.</p> <p>The kids in the audience wish he was still dancing jelly-legged beside Spices Posh, Baby and Sporty, and wonder when the next basket of sweets is coming round. Soon he will be the man with the prizes at spoof game show The Spice is Right, making the production crew laugh with his cheeky display of nail-painting kits and toy karaoke machines. He's known throughout the world as an invincible martial arts action hero. The incongruity is delicious. </p> <p>But then, maybe Chan's irrepressible appearance on the Saturday morning kids TV programme SM:TV isn't that strange. He has, after all, spent the past two decades playing up to the camera as bumbling figures remarkably skilled in acrobatics and kung fu, becoming Asia'a number one celebrity and winning an MTV lifetime achievement award in 1995 in the process. His films exude an infectious good humour, a characteristic he cultivated 22 years ago to escape being called the new Bruce Lee and establish himself as the ultimate martial arts actor. It works: you simply can't imagine the glowering Lee brandishing a spice rack on kids TV. </p> <p>That afternoon, Chan visits Leicester Square to talk at a screening of his new film, Shanghai Noon, an ebullient number set in 1880s Nevada that sees Chan fighting cowboys and Indians to rescue a damsel in distress. Although Chan has made innumerable films (one list sets the figure at around 80), this is the first time he has received a Leicester Square premiere.</p> <p>But this is no glitzy red-carpet affair: the afternoon has been organised by Chan's UK fan club to raise money for Sarah Stevenson, a member of Britain's tae kwon do team at the forthcoming Olympics, and the atmosphere is muted. Certainly no one in London's nearby Chinatown seems to know that Chan is here. After the film finishes there's no spectacular party, but a quiet photo session in Planet Hollywood with 100 of Chan's respectful fans. The closest Chan gets to glamour is when Melanie C bursts into his dressing room at the TV studio to ask for his autograph. </p> <p>Strange, perhaps, because the desire to be a huge star fuels everything he does. It's because he longs to be hero-worshipped that his longtime manager, a dapper man in floaty Hawaiian shirt called Willie (confusingly, his surname is also Chan), is unable to think of a bone that Chan hasn't broken in the cause of fame. It's because he has long been consumed with frustration at being able to walk from New York to LA with no one but the proprietors of Chinese restaurants batting an eyelid that Chan has spent the last 20 years trying to break the American market, efforts that are finally being repaid. </p> <p>It has taken enormous tenacity for Chan to overcome the conservatism and racism endemic in Hollywood. He first attempted the move in 1980, but he had only achieved prominence in Asia two years earlier, with the kung fu comedies Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master, and Hollywood couldn't give a flying frog about him.</p> <p>He appeared in The Cannonball Run, and experienced two dismal flops with The Big Brawl (1980, directed by Robert \"Enter the Dragon\" Clouse), and cop flick The Protector (1985) - he later complained that Hollywood was only interested in him playing Japanese bad guys. He turned down such roles because \"Asian people would kill me!\" In between, he made the pirate film Project A (1983), widely acknowledged as one of his greatest. </p> <p>Chan wasn't acknowledged by Hollywood, however, until a re-edited, dubbed version of Rumble in the Bronx, directed by Stanley Tong, became a box office hit in 1996, grossing over $30m. After 16 years of trying, Chan had, as far as the US mainstream was concerned, arrived.</p> <p>As Frederic Dannen points out in Hong Kong Babylon, Chan's sudden popularity wasn't an isolated event. The film that preceded Rumble in the Bronx as the top movie in the US was John Woo's Broken Arrow. Woo had come to Hollywood in 1994 to direct the Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Hard Target, at a time when Quentin Tarantino was still ubiquitous and volubly praising the excellence of Hong Kong cinema (it's rumoured that Tarantino personally ensured that Chan won his MTV award).</p> <p>But whereas films such as Broken Arrow and Mission: Impossible 2 could have been directed by practically anyone with a flair for explosives, there isn't anyone in Hollywood doing what Chan does best: creating exhilarating, perilous stunts and fight sequences that redefine the boundaries of martial arts cinema. </p> <p>The fact that Chan does every stunt, fall, punch, kick and somersault himself sets him apart from any action hero you care to mention. He developed his terrifying capacity to absorb pain during his decade as a ward at the Peking Opera School, where he learned acrobatics, martial arts, singing, mime and acting, worked for 19 hours each day and was severely beaten for the slightest misdemeanour. (Crying when beaten was on the list of transgressions.) Although he was a child actor while still at school, his career really kicked off in the early 70s when he became a stunt man, notably on Fist of Fury. (Bruce Lee was said to be impressed when he accidentally bashed Chan on the temple and the teenager didn't stop acting.) </p> <p>From stuntman, Chan progressed to action choreographer and in 1979, at the age of 25, he made his directorial debut with the formula action flick Fearless Hyena. Starring as a young man undergoing gruelling but entertaining kung fu training, Chan incorporated in the film some superb set pieces that required him to dodge spears and balance on ceramic bowls. From there it was a short skip to hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella (Police Story, 1985) and bouncing on to the top of a hot air balloon (Armour of God, 1986). </p> <p>Like most American action directors, Chan builds his films around a few inventive vignettes.

      "bodyText": "Jackie Chan, introduced as the world's \"biggest and bestest movie star\" grins as SM:TV presenter Cat Deeley whizzes questions light as frisbees at him. In between getting her to feel the hole in his skull, punctured when a stunt went near-fatally wrong, and laughing over his fear of horses, he relates how his parents nearly sold him at birth for \u00a3120. The kids in the audience wish he was still dancing jelly-legged beside Spices Posh, Baby and Sporty, and wonder when the next basket of sweets is coming round. Soon he will be the man with the prizes at spoof game show The Spice is Right, making the production crew laugh with his cheeky display of nail-painting kits and toy karaoke machines. He's known throughout the world as an invincible martial arts action hero. The incongruity is delicious. But then, maybe Chan's irrepressible appearance on the Saturday morning kids TV programme SM:TV isn't that strange. He has, after all, spent the past two decades playing up to the camera as bumbling figures remarkably skilled in acrobatics and kung fu, becoming Asia'a number one celebrity and winning an MTV lifetime achievement award in 1995 in the process. His films exude an infectious good humour, a characteristic he cultivated 22 years ago to escape being called the new Bruce Lee and establish himself as the ultimate martial arts actor. It works: you simply can't imagine the glowering Lee brandishing a spice rack on kids TV. That afternoon, Chan visits Leicester Square to talk at a screening of his new film, Shanghai Noon, an ebullient number set in 1880s Nevada that sees Chan fighting cowboys and Indians to rescue a damsel in distress. Although Chan has made innumerable films (one list sets the figure at around 80), this is the first time he has received a Leicester Square premiere. But this is no glitzy red-carpet affair: the afternoon has been organised by Chan's UK fan club to raise money for Sarah Stevenson, a member of Britain's tae kwon do team at the forthcoming Olympics, and the atmosphere is muted. Certainly no one in London's nearby Chinatown seems to know that Chan is here. After the film finishes there's no spectacular party, but a quiet photo session in Planet Hollywood with 100 of Chan's respectful fans. The closest Chan gets to glamour is when Melanie C bursts into his dressing room at the TV studio to ask for his autograph. Strange, perhaps, because the desire to be a huge star fuels everything he does. It's because he longs to be hero-worshipped that his longtime manager, a dapper man in floaty Hawaiian shirt called Willie (confusingly, his surname is also Chan), is unable to think of a bone that Chan hasn't broken in the cause of fame. It's because he has long been consumed with frustration at being able to walk from New York to LA with no one but the proprietors of Chinese restaurants batting an eyelid that Chan has spent the last 20 years trying to break the American market, efforts that are finally being repaid. It has taken enormous tenacity for Chan to overcome the conservatism and racism endemic in Hollywood. He first attempted the move in 1980, but he had only achieved prominence in Asia two years earlier, with the kung fu comedies Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master, and Hollywood couldn't give a flying frog about him. He appeared in The Cannonball Run, and experienced two dismal flops with The Big Brawl (1980, directed by Robert \"Enter the Dragon\" Clouse), and cop flick The Protector (1985) - he later complained that Hollywood was only interested in him playing Japanese bad guys. He turned down such roles because \"Asian people would kill me!\" In between, he made the pirate film Project A (1983), widely acknowledged as one of his greatest. Chan wasn't acknowledged by Hollywood, however, until a re-edited, dubbed version of Rumble in the Bronx, directed by Stanley Tong, became a box office hit in 1996, grossing over $30m. After 16 years of trying, Chan had, as far as the US mainstream was concerned, arrived. As Frederic Dannen points out in Hong Kong Babylon, Chan's sudden popularity wasn't an isolated event. The film that preceded Rumble in the Bronx as the top movie in the US was John Woo's Broken Arrow. Woo had come to Hollywood in 1994 to direct the Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicle Hard Target, at a time when Quentin Tarantino was still ubiquitous and volubly praising the excellence of Hong Kong cinema (it's rumoured that Tarantino personally ensured that Chan won his MTV award). But whereas films such as Broken Arrow and Mission: Impossible 2 could have been directed by practically anyone with a flair for explosives, there isn't anyone in Hollywood doing what Chan does best: creating exhilarating, perilous stunts and fight sequences that redefine the boundaries of martial arts cinema. The fact that Chan does every stunt, fall, punch, kick and somersault himself sets him apart from any action hero you care to mention. He developed his terrifying capacity to absorb pain during his decade as a ward at the Peking Opera School, where he learned acrobatics, martial arts, singing, mime and acting, worked for 19 hours each day and was severely beaten for the slightest misdemeanour. (Crying when beaten was on the list of transgressions.) Although he was a child actor while still at school, his career really kicked off in the early 70s when he became a stunt man, notably on Fist of Fury. (Bruce Lee was said to be impressed when he accidentally bashed Chan on the temple and the teenager didn't stop acting.) From stuntman, Chan progressed to action choreographer and in 1979, at the age of 25, he made his directorial debut with the formula action flick Fearless Hyena. Starring as a young man undergoing gruelling but entertaining kung fu training, Chan incorporated in the film some superb set pieces that required him to dodge spears and balance on ceramic bowls. From there it was a short skip to hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella (Police Story, 1985) and bouncing on to the top of a hot air balloon (Armour of God, 1986). Like most American action directors, Chan builds his films around a few inventive vignettes. He'll open with a big chase and progress through a few fights and breathtaking stunts to a final combination sequence that can last anything up to 20 minutes and usually pays scant regard to the dictates of dramatic coherence. In Chan's eyes, the more pyrotechnic this last scenario, the better: Drunken Master 2 involves firebreathing and a bed of hot coals; Police Story 2 ends with a fireworks factory exploding. However, it's the (slightly) more traditional kung fu scenes, in which Chan fights using whatever household objects cross his path, that really light up the screen.

Just as The Blair Witch Project electrified western filmgoers with its low tech/high terror approach, so Ring and its sequels are setting audience records across the far east by returning to one of the staples of Asian cinema - the ghost story. </p> <p>When cinema came to Japan 100 years ago, it drew on the repertoire of the popular kabuki drama. Many of these plays were ghost stories. The most famous, Yotsuya Kaidan, a tale of spectral revenge meted out to a treacherous husband, has been adapted for the screen more than 25 times. Its ghost is an archetypal image of Japanese horror cinema: a wronged woman, hungry for revenge. She seems to float towards her victim, long black hair trailing behind her, face white as ashes. </p> <p>These spooky stories got a big boost after the war when samurai dramas, the other great staple of Japanese cinema, were banned by the allied forces for political reasons.

The first to manifest itself is an umbrella ghost, a bizarre, one-legged creature with a long tongue. An army of faceless men and a giant laughing head soon follow.

Each episode features a woman, always called Nami, who investigates a violent mystery that seems to implicate her in ways that are never entirely clear.

Shiryo no Wana (usually translated as Evil Dead Trap) begins with a late-night TV hostess (again called Nami) being sent a snuff movie tape, apparently showing her own torture and death. With three female colleagues and a male director she sets off to the location where the video was shot. The team end up in an abandoned government research station.

      "bodyText": "The scariest scenes in the hit Japanese horror movie Ring are also the simplest: a sinister young girl brushing her long black hair in a mirror; the mouth of a well surrounded by trees; waves breaking on a night-time beach; a TV set popping into life in an empty room. Just as The Blair Witch Project electrified western filmgoers with its low tech/high terror approach, so Ring and its sequels are setting audience records across the far east by returning to one of the staples of Asian cinema - the ghost story. When cinema came to Japan 100 years ago, it drew on the repertoire of the popular kabuki drama. Many of these plays were ghost stories. The most famous, Yotsuya Kaidan, a tale of spectral revenge meted out to a treacherous husband, has been adapted for the screen more than 25 times. Its ghost is an archetypal image of Japanese horror cinema: a wronged woman, hungry for revenge. She seems to float towards her victim, long black hair trailing behind her, face white as ashes. These spooky stories got a big boost after the war when samurai dramas, the other great staple of Japanese cinema, were banned by the allied forces for political reasons. The 50s saw a positive torrent of ghost films. The big studios, Toei, Daiei and Shintoho incorporated spectral cats, vengeful females and haunted swamps into their scenarios with a single-minded dedication to thrill and chill. These low-budget shockers made regular appearances in cinemas during the months of July and August, the time of O-Bon, the festival of the dead.

In their view, no real animal lover would have anything to do with animal experiments.

Anti-vivisectionists pointed to such experiments as examples of unnecessary testing. Even new drugs, they argued, could be checked in the test tube and by computer modelling. HLS scientists countered that the technology, while improving, was not yet ready. \"I can foresee a time when it will not be necessary to do these studies,\" said an HLS researcher. \"In a few decades, it may well be that animal experimentation will go away forever. The difficulty is that at the moment, the non-animal tests are not robust enough, or acceptable to governments, to prove new medicines are safe.\"",
