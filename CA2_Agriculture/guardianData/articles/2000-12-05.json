On the one hand, it is more about symbol than substance, a very Europe thing. Yet the way he jumps will also declare a firm choice between the nation and the collective.

That's about the size of it, Jacques. We'll soon be seeing what this mercurial, tainted but durable leader is made of.</p> <p>There are many issues at Nice, but the fount from which answers will cascade is whether France and Germany shall any longer be exactly equal members. So far Chirac has insisted: yes. The voting weights each is allocated, he says, must continue to reflect the parity with which they entered the EEC in 1958 at the hand of the founding fathers, who spoke not only for Franco-German equality but for an overweighting for smaller members like Belgium and Holland too. Though reunified Germany now has 20m more citizens than France, Chirac says, it should seek no greater voting weight.</p> <p>This is an indefensible position. Not only is it unfair to Germany, it would have destructive consequences lower down the line. The most viable proposal on the table is for France, Italy and Britain to have 30 votes in EU councils, while Germany gets 32 or 33. If something like this doesn't happen, there will be turmoil elsewhere. Spain, with 20m fewer people than France or Britain, will, since population is deemed not an issue, demand to be in the 30-vote league as well. Belgium, a smaller country than the Netherlands, will insist on retaining the same vote count. Smaller applicant countries will demand to be treated like Sweden and Finland. None of this will be acceptable to larger countries skewered by such arrangements.</p> <p>What's being proposed, in other words, exchanges a post-second world war philosophy of semi-equality for a post-cold war philosophy of numerical legitimacy. Only that way can public support be mobilised in the larger countries. Numbers are now perceived to count for more than they did. Yet France, by rejecting that, is capable of wrecking the only platform on which a Treaty of Nice can hope to be built. At present she is also rejecting the more blurry alternative, which would retain present parities but superimpose on them direct population counts, the so-called double majority, which would again give Germany more clout but not so obviously.</p> <p>Chirac has his problems. At the same time as running this summit, he coexists alongside his socialist rival, prime minister Lionel Jospin, while preparing to fight him in a presidential election. On the other hand, there's not much evidence that Jospin is personally so hung up on parity with the Germans. Domestically Chirac could defuse the issue by striking a deal with him. But there's more than politics involved here. Chirac, the post-Gaullist, is psychologically resistant. All logic is against him, and just about every other member of the EU stands to suffer if he does not move. The first thing to watch this weekend is whether the man with more wrecking power than Margaret Thatcher ever had chooses to deploy it.</p> <p>If he's prepared to yield, some other important things might begin to flow. With the weights thus adjusted, qualified majority voting has more acceptance. From notorious nation-killer QMV more readily emerges as the oil for Europe's necessary momentum.

What is my pessimism based on? The fact that few leaders, even outside the immediate context of a summit negotiation, seem prepared to contemplate a reassessment of national sovereignty in areas that matter. For Britain the neuralgic issue is tax - any tax, any reform, any pooling of power no matter how valuable to every country including this one, any tax decision of any kind. The same blanket political ban, on different issues for different countries, proves that Britain is not the only place where rational discussion is hard to find in the arenas that count.</p> <p>What makes this doubly perplexing is the relative strength of most of the national leaders involved. It is true that elections drive some of them. For the French duet this probably makes the defence of cultural heritage, the purpose of their veto on trade issues, unavoidable. Elsewhere, Schr\u00f6der of Germany surveys a decimated opposition. Aznar of Spain has just been re-elected. Italy, though the most fragile of the governments, is never going to argue over the EU.

Bayern take possession early on and pass the ball around, probing the Arsenal midfield. <br><strong>3 GOAL </strong>Pires takes the ball down the left, crosses the ball low into the centre and in comes to Kanu after a quick dummy from Henry. Kanu, surrounded by three defenders plays the ball into the path of the advancing Henry, who shoots low and hard past Kahn into the net. <br><strong>6</strong> Arsenal continue to make a good start, going forward again through Ljungberg. he moves forward into the box, trying to find room for a shot. When it comes it cannons off a Bayern defender for a corner. Cole's corner is headed away by the German defence. <br><strong>10 </strong> Henry finds himself in space in the Bayern half, and although three defenders quickly surround him, he manages to get in a shot to test Kahn. <br><strong>11 </strong> It's Kanu's turn to find himself in space this time, and from around 30 yards out he fires a shot in so hard that Kahn can only punch it away. Arsenal are certainly playing with purpose. <br><strong>13 </strong>Ljungberg skins Tarnat in his own half, advances forward into central midfield and the Bayern defence have to scramble the ball away yet again. After a Bayern clearance, the Gunners put together another neat passing movement before Ljungberg's shot is deflected into Kahn's arms. <br><strong>17 </strong>A Pires corner falls tantalisingly into the bayern box with a period of head tennis to follow. Bayern's defence look unsettled, and Arsenal and the crowd call for a penalty, whicvh the referee dismisses out of hand (replays show that a penalty appeal is justified). Bayern suddenly break upfield through Salihamidzic, a move which is only stopped by Viera on the edge of the Arsenal box. Free kick. <br><strong>18 </strong> Bayern's free kick rebounds off the Arsenal wall and the ball is cleared. <br><strong>22 </strong> Ashley Cole breaks forward through midfield, playing with confidence and composure, so much so that he tries a shot from around 25 yds out, which balloons high over the bar. <br> <strong>24 </strong>Bayern are starting to make bright counters. They're helped by Manninger, who sends a back pass from Viera straight into the path of Scholl, who fails to capitalise on the chance. <br><strong>28 </strong> Another Arsenal attack is stopped on the edge of the Bayern area by a foul on Ljungberg by Sforza (who receives yellow card for his troubles). Pires dummies the free kick, leaving it to Henry to shoot into the wall. <br> <strong>30 </strong>Ljungberg is causing the bayern team all kinds of problems, attacking from midfield. On this occassion he skips past Linke on the touchline, cutting the ball back for Kanu, who fires wide on the nearpost. <br> <strong>33 </strong>Salihamidzic takes the ball forward into the Arsenal half, only to be brought down by Cole. Tarnat's free kick - from 35 yds out - is ineffectual, hoofed away by the Arsenal defence on the edge of the box. <br> <strong>35 </strong>Arsenal threaten the Bayern defence yet again.

Bayern Munich: Kahn; Kuffour, Sforza, Linke; Sagnol, Effenberg, Tarnat, Jeremies; Scholl; Elber, Salihamidzic. Referee: Stefano Braschi (Italy) 1 Arsenal kick off. Bayern take possession early on and pass the ball around, probing the Arsenal midfield. 3 GOAL Pires takes the ball down the left, crosses the ball low into the centre and in comes to Kanu after a quick dummy from Henry. Kanu, surrounded by three defenders plays the ball into the path of the advancing Henry, who shoots low and hard past Kahn into the net. 6 Arsenal continue to make a good start, going forward again through Ljungberg. he moves forward into the box, trying to find room for a shot. When it comes it cannons off a Bayern defender for a corner. Cole's corner is headed away by the German defence. 10 Henry finds himself in space in the Bayern half, and although three defenders quickly surround him, he manages to get in a shot to test Kahn. 11 It's Kanu's turn to find himself in space this time, and from around 30 yards out he fires a shot in so hard that Kahn can only punch it away. Arsenal are certainly playing with purpose. 13 Ljungberg skins Tarnat in his own half, advances forward into central midfield and the Bayern defence have to scramble the ball away yet again. After a Bayern clearance, the Gunners put together another neat passing movement before Ljungberg's shot is deflected into Kahn's arms. 17 A Pires corner falls tantalisingly into the bayern box with a period of head tennis to follow. Bayern's defence look unsettled, and Arsenal and the crowd call for a penalty, whicvh the referee dismisses out of hand (replays show that a penalty appeal is justified). Bayern suddenly break upfield through Salihamidzic, a move which is only stopped by Viera on the edge of the Arsenal box. Free kick. 18 Bayern's free kick rebounds off the Arsenal wall and the ball is cleared. 22 Ashley Cole breaks forward through midfield, playing with confidence and composure, so much so that he tries a shot from around 25 yds out, which balloons high over the bar. 24 Bayern are starting to make bright counters. They're helped by Manninger, who sends a back pass from Viera straight into the path of Scholl, who fails to capitalise on the chance. 28 Another Arsenal attack is stopped on the edge of the Bayern area by a foul on Ljungberg by Sforza (who receives yellow card for his troubles). Pires dummies the free kick, leaving it to Henry to shoot into the wall. 30 Ljungberg is causing the bayern team all kinds of problems, attacking from midfield. On this occassion he skips past Linke on the touchline, cutting the ball back for Kanu, who fires wide on the nearpost. 33 Salihamidzic takes the ball forward into the Arsenal half, only to be brought down by Cole. Tarnat's free kick - from 35 yds out - is ineffectual, hoofed away by the Arsenal defence on the edge of the box. 35 Arsenal threaten the Bayern defence yet again. They get into the Bayern box through Pires, who cuts it back. Grimandi takes too long on the ball, and is forced to play it across to Luzhny. The move breaks down, the ball going out for the Gunners fourth corner. Pires takes it, and yet again the Bayern defence display vampiric tendencies before the ball falls to Adams, whose header is deflected onto the post before Bayern hustle it away. 39 Bayern's best chance comes after a deep ball falls to the feet of Elber, who lays it back to Scholl.

      "body": "<p>The breakdown of the meeting on climate change in the Hague and the continuing uncertainty surrounding the American presidency mark a new and dangerous point in international affairs. The world's major states cannot agree on policies to deal with global warming. The United States faces years of indecisive government, with Washington paralysed by score-settling and legislative gridlock. Against this background, there can be no concerted action to cope with the environmental crisis. The world is set on a course of wild globalisation. </p> <p>In itself, the collapse of the climate talks two weeks ago in the Hague is not particularly significant. The meeting was an attempt to ratify the 1997 Kyoto convention on reducing greenhouse gases. Its failure has been widely put at the door of the Americans, but the Europeans were probably equally to blame in not following up concessions offered by the American delegation in the later stages of the talks. </p> <p>Whoever was most at fault, it is vital to understand that the Kyoto protocol is itself a wholly inadequate response to the hazards facing the global environment. The protocol aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to a few percentage points beneath their levels a decade ago. But even if that goal could be achieved, it would not halt climate change. The consensus among scientists is that global warming is already irreversible.

      "bodyText": "The breakdown of the meeting on climate change in the Hague and the continuing uncertainty surrounding the American presidency mark a new and dangerous point in international affairs. The world's major states cannot agree on policies to deal with global warming. The United States faces years of indecisive government, with Washington paralysed by score-settling and legislative gridlock. Against this background, there can be no concerted action to cope with the environmental crisis. The world is set on a course of wild globalisation. In itself, the collapse of the climate talks two weeks ago in the Hague is not particularly significant. The meeting was an attempt to ratify the 1997 Kyoto convention on reducing greenhouse gases. Its failure has been widely put at the door of the Americans, but the Europeans were probably equally to blame in not following up concessions offered by the American delegation in the later stages of the talks. Whoever was most at fault, it is vital to understand that the Kyoto protocol is itself a wholly inadequate response to the hazards facing the global environment. The protocol aimed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to a few percentage points beneath their levels a decade ago. But even if that goal could be achieved, it would not halt climate change. The consensus among scientists is that global warming is already irreversible. According to some estimates, levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would double even if every country in the world cut its emissions below 1990 levels. In fact, there is not the remotest prospect of this happening. It is not just that imposing the necessary fiscal measures is politically impossible in the US, and - as has been evident since the fuel protests in September - far from easy in Europe.

      "bodyText": "1. Former chancellor Norman Lamont has received a medal for his \"extraordinary and valiant attitude\" in defending Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet. 2. Lamont, hailed as a \"prominent Englishman\" by the Pinochet Foundation, is chiefly remembered in Britain for presiding over sterling's humiliating ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday, then refusing to resign as chancellor. 3. Pinochet is to stand trial in Chile accused of a litany of human rights abuses including kidnapping, murder, torture, illegal burial and illicit association. But don't let that put you off. 4. Pinochet seized power from Salvadore Allende's democratically elected leftwing government in a US-backed military coup in 1973. He ruled Chile as a dictator until 1990. 5. The general's prosecution in his home country follows his arrest in London in 1998. Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon had requested his extradition to face trial for crimes against Spanish citizens. 6. But after 18 months of legal wrangling, Pinochet was sent home to Chile in March this year after the home secretary, Jack Straw, accepted a medical report that he was not well enough to stand trial. 7. Apart from Lamont, Pinochet's other pals in Britain include former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who \"took tea\" with the despot and addressed a rally of Pinochet fans at a Tory party conference. Pity his British victims weren't around to join in the fun. 8. The poorly general heroically summoned the strength to attend a homecoming rally and again defied medical experts at his birthday party. 9. But the mood had changed in Chile during the senator-for-life's absence, and he was stripped of his immunity so he could be tried for his alleged atrocities. 10. What of the newly-decorated Lamont? The ex-chancellor is expected to concentrate on his career as a talented songwriter. Oh no, hang on, that's a different Norman Lamont. The one I'm thinking of looks more like a badger.",

The Florida court will offer that clarification today. If it rescinds its earlier ruling, Gore is effectively finished. <p>Other, less crucial legal arguments will be heard in federal courts. In one, Bush lawyers will demand that recounts be disallowed. In another, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People will allege that voting rights were systematically denied to black people in Florida. But it all turns on the judgment of the court in the Florida state capital, Tallahassee. </p> <p><b>Hasn't Gore already lost his case in Florida?</b><br>On Monday, a circuit judge threw out his demand for manual recounts in the crucial three counties. But now Democrat lawyers are appealing against that ruling. </p> <p><b>What's the latest deadline?</b><br>Florida needs to appoint its 25 electoral college voters - and therefore the president of the USA - by December 12, six days before the college conclave. </p> <p>If the electoral and legal wrangling is not over by then, the strongly Republican state legislature has threatened to appoint the electors itself, as it is legally entitled to do. That will automatically send Bush to the White House. </p> <p><b>By the way, who got the most votes?</b><br>Across the nation, vice president Al Gore got a quarter of a million more votes than governor George W Bush in an incredibly close race. He claims to have got more in Florida too, but the official tally puts the Republican ahead by 930, out of 6m. </p> <p><b>Why does Florida matter so much?</b><br>Because US presidents are not elected directly but through an electoral college. In 48 of the 50 states, the candidate who finishes top collects all of that state's votes in the college (in the two oddballs, Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who comes second is given one of the college votes as well). As things stand, neither Gore nor Bush has yet achieved a majority in the electoral college. </p> <p><b>How is the electoral college organised?</b><br>The college has 538 seats. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Roughly, college votes are allocated to states by population. </p> <p>As the largest state, California has 54 votes in the electoral college. New York is second with 33. Seven sparsely populated states, plus the District of Columbia, have three votes each, the minimum allowed. </p> <p><b>Who got to vote?</b><br>All US citizens aged over 18 have the right to vote - although this is qualified by a range of conditions, including, in some states, the long-term loss of voting rights by anyone sent to prison. It is this clause that has disqualified many poor, black citizens in the southern states, including Florida.</p>",

On Monday, a circuit judge threw out his demand for manual recounts in the crucial three counties. But now Democrat lawyers are appealing against that ruling. What's the latest deadline? Florida needs to appoint its 25 electoral college voters - and therefore the president of the USA - by December 12, six days before the college conclave. If the electoral and legal wrangling is not over by then, the strongly Republican state legislature has threatened to appoint the electors itself, as it is legally entitled to do. That will automatically send Bush to the White House. By the way, who got the most votes? Across the nation, vice president Al Gore got a quarter of a million more votes than governor George W Bush in an incredibly close race. He claims to have got more in Florida too, but the official tally puts the Republican ahead by 930, out of 6m. Why does Florida matter so much? Because US presidents are not elected directly but through an electoral college. In 48 of the 50 states, the candidate who finishes top collects all of that state's votes in the college (in the two oddballs, Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who comes second is given one of the college votes as well). As things stand, neither Gore nor Bush has yet achieved a majority in the electoral college. How is the electoral college organised? The college has 538 seats. A candidate needs 270 electoral college votes to win. Roughly, college votes are allocated to states by population. As the largest state, California has 54 votes in the electoral college. New York is second with 33. Seven sparsely populated states, plus the District of Columbia, have three votes each, the minimum allowed. Who got to vote? All US citizens aged over 18 have the right to vote - although this is qualified by a range of conditions, including, in some states, the long-term loss of voting rights by anyone sent to prison. It is this clause that has disqualified many poor, black citizens in the southern states, including Florida.",

Put it this way, I don't think it's a good idea.\" And after revelations like that, it was only a matter of time before Venables compared the selection of a football team to a six-year international conflict involving genocide: \"It's like saying, 'We're in the war and we've got no generals. Well, what's Rommel doing? Is he available?'\" Terry was then asked if his comments were slightly hypocritical given his stewardship of the Australian national team. He replied by opening his mouth and going \"naaaaahhhh\" for over seven minutes, saying \"that's different\" with a cheeky east-end wink, and offering to buy everyone an eel. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool are in the hunt for Barcelona's highly-rated wingback Gabri. Sammy Lee was spotted watching Barca's last match against Celta Vigo, according to Planet Football, and the Reds could be tempted to make a bid for the 21-year-old now the Spanish transfer window has opened. Leicester are on the verge of signing Seth Johnson from Derby. If the move for the left-sided midfielder goes through, winger Steve Guppy may be on his way to Southampton. Aston Villa are poised to re-sign Steve Staunton on a free transfer from Liverpool. Villa manager John Gregory is optimistic that the deal for 31-year-old defender will be completed within the next 24 hours. Wolves are to open talks with Sunderland in a bid to sign defender Paul Butler for around \u00a31m. Since the Republic of Ireland international joined the Molineux club on loan last month, they have lost just once. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Gary Megson has signed a new three-year contract with West Brom after leading the Baggies to third place in the First Division.

      "bodyText": "An investigation was under way today into allegations of child abuse at the London Oratory school. The inquiry centres on a former chaplain and governor at the Roman Catholic state school in Fulham, south-west London, at which Prime Minister Tony Blair's two eldest sons are pupils. Police and social services acted after pupils alleged they were abused by Father David Martin, who died of a suspected Aids-related illness two years ago. Martin was alleged to have met at least six pupils in his rooms at the London Oratory church, to which the highly regarded school is affiliated. Two boys were said to have expressed fears that they might have contracted the HIV virus from the 44-year-old Scots-born priest, who died in September 1998. There is no suggestion that Mr Blair's sons are involved in the allegations or the investigation. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said: \"Allegations of abuse at a London school have been received by the Hammersmith and Fulham child protection team. \"The allegations are being investigated.\" ChildLine founder and chairman Esther Rantzen confirmed that the telephone helpline had been contacted by children who made allegations of abuse at the Oratory school. She refused to discuss the case further, but said: \"As a journalist, I have received for years letters making allegations against priests working in the Roman Catholic church, so I am very aware of the problem. \"I also know that this does occur from time to time in schools and I know how difficult it is to investigate these circumstances when they occur in schools,\" she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"Children who are sexually abused are very often frightened, guilty and ashamed and take the blame on themselves. \"When this happens inside a school, they often feel that they have to protect even their own parents, who sent them there for their own good, and they don't want to hurt their parents by revealing what has happened. \"So there are a great deal of areas in which we need to reassure children in order to ensure the truth comes out.\" A spokeswoman for Hammersmith and Fulham council confirmed that a child protection team investigation was under way. As school chaplain, Martin was employed by the church, not the school, so it is not clear whether he was subject to police checks before working with pupils, she said. Martin entered the priesthood as a novice in 1988 after a 10-year career as a stockbroker in the City of London, the Daily Mail reported. He was ordained by the late Cardinal Basil Hume, archbishop of Westminster, in 1994. Martin died four years later from bronchopneumonia in the hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Westminster. The 1,360-pupil Catholic boys' school, which admits girls in the sixth form, was founded by the Fathers of the London Oratory in 1863.

      "body": "<p>Medicine has taken over my entire field of vision. I can't look at my girlfriend's forearms without thinking how easy and satisfying it would be to gently slip a cannula into her prominent, lovely veins. When we kiss, I'm feeling up her spine and assessing where I could best insert a lumbar puncture needle. I've managed to cut down on calling the ward from my mobile after work, but I can't stop making diagnoses on the bus. </p> <p>You will be relieved to hear that we have all been washing our hands with unswerving diligence, which is more than I can say for some of our patients, one of whom I interrupted this morning urinating in his NHS water jug because his bottle was full. People on the cusp of dependence, I suspect, don't like asking for help, and I can see a lot of myself in some of the things they do. Which is why I felt particularly awkward on his behalf when the consultant came back from answering a call and poured him out a glass of water, explaining that he has to keep drinking if we're ever going to take his drip down. Needless to say we (the patient and I) kept our traps shut. </p> <p>Death and disease continue unabated, but self-inflicted suffering seems to be all the rage among the patients coming my way in the casualty department this month. Teenage suicide attempts are always a treat, because (like deep vein thromboses) they're quick to manage and a good way to keep your numbers up in A&amp;E. There's nothing like a reputation for ploughing through patients and clearing the waiting list in the run up to the Christmas rush. </p> <p>Junkies, on the other hand, are a different story. First of all, let me put my cards on the table. As a Guardian-reading liberal wet, I tend to believe that heroin addicts are victims of society, and that their victimisation is counter-productive, the source of most of their problems, and emblematic of our victimisation of the morally weak in society in general. </p> <p>Which is all very well until they steal my video recorder, or pitch up in casualty at one in the morning covered in vomit. Opiate overdoses, in the textbook, are very easy to manage: you get intra-venous access and hit them with an antidote called naloxone, which I am tempted to suggest should be handed out at needle exchanges to save us all the worry. </p> <p>Now I don't know if you've ever looked at the arms of your average junkie, but by the time they get in deep enough to overdose, they have usually knocked off every vein in their body. The company they keep tends to be friendly to the point of total social disinhibition, and companions are over-eager to get involved in the workings of the casualty department. It's a shame that it would be frowned upon to ask for their help getting into a vein, because I imagine that they would be far better at it than me. </p> <p>The other thing that textbooks tend not to mention about giving naloxone is that the moment it kicks in, the patient kicks out and sits bolt upright, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, demanding to know what the fuck you think you are doing, wasting \u00a310-worth of prime smack he worked really rather hard for, and shouts his head off for half an hour. Then, just when you are about to get away, the antidote wears off, they slip back into respiratory arrest, and start trying to choke on their own vomit again. This is no fun at all. </p> <p>But the worst thing is that people just keep on trying to die on me, against the best efforts of everyone around them. So on Thursday night I had yet another family trying to blackmail me into shoving tubes in to feed their dying matriarch who, despite speaking not a word of English, was very clearly both well-oriented and determined to pass away peacefully (and thank God it was a week night so I could safely leave the decision for her own team to make the next morning). </p> <p>And this morning, a man who I had looked after for three weeks, who I had caught laughing at the papers every morning (\"It's all just a load of nonsense, I'm so glad I'm leaving it all behind\"), who sat me down the first time we met in A&amp;E and somehow made me share all my aspirations with him before telling me that I had it all wrong, that the most important thing in life was the person you chose to spend it with, and that when his wife of 53 years passed away he knew he was going to follow her soon . . . this morning he finally willed himself to death.</p>",

Now I don't know if you've ever looked at the arms of your average junkie, but by the time they get in deep enough to overdose, they have usually knocked off every vein in their body. The company they keep tends to be friendly to the point of total social disinhibition, and companions are over-eager to get involved in the workings of the casualty department. It's a shame that it would be frowned upon to ask for their help getting into a vein, because I imagine that they would be far better at it than me. The other thing that textbooks tend not to mention about giving naloxone is that the moment it kicks in, the patient kicks out and sits bolt upright, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, demanding to know what the fuck you think you are doing, wasting \u00a310-worth of prime smack he worked really rather hard for, and shouts his head off for half an hour. Then, just when you are about to get away, the antidote wears off, they slip back into respiratory arrest, and start trying to choke on their own vomit again. This is no fun at all. But the worst thing is that people just keep on trying to die on me, against the best efforts of everyone around them. So on Thursday night I had yet another family trying to blackmail me into shoving tubes in to feed their dying matriarch who, despite speaking not a word of English, was very clearly both well-oriented and determined to pass away peacefully (and thank God it was a week night so I could safely leave the decision for her own team to make the next morning). And this morning, a man who I had looked after for three weeks, who I had caught laughing at the papers every morning (\"It's all just a load of nonsense, I'm so glad I'm leaving it all behind\"), who sat me down the first time we met in A&amp;E and somehow made me share all my aspirations with him before telling me that I had it all wrong, that the most important thing in life was the person you chose to spend it with, and that when his wife of 53 years passed away he knew he was going to follow her soon . . . this morning he finally willed himself to death.",

Perhaps they did not know. </p> <p>His final indignity in this traumatic period occurred barely a month before he died. With extreme difficulty he hauled himself out of his bed to attend a regular appointment at Milton Keynes hospital. On arrival he waited two hours for the results of a blood test. They never came. He was then informed by a doctor that his notes had been lost and that he should come back in two months. Shaking with rage and shattered at the callous reaction, his poor wife blazed out: \"You can't possibly see him again. In two months he'll be dead.\" </p> <p>Several months after he finally passed away came a further example of the appalling lack of organisation and concern at Milton Keynes when his widow took a call from the hospital. \"We're just checking up on Mr Harper and to see whether he needs another apppointment.\" </p> <p>My brother Nigel had cancer of the neck. At his death, his entire body was a shell, riddled with disease. His weight had almost halved: as his illness developed, eating had become progressively more difficult. He barely picked at his food and kept himself going mainly with liquids. To help him eat, the hospital suggested that a shunt could be inserted into his stomach so that he could be fed intravenously. It is a simple operation and a proposal to which, as always, he willingly agreed, even though people who have experienced the procedure will know the results are not always straightforward and far from comfortable. The patient, usually asleep, lies in bed and slowly receives nourishment directly into the stomach over a period of hours. </p> <p>Once again the hospital let him down, as he braced himself to take this next hurdle.

But the opposite was the case. We had to abandon the trip halfway up the M6. He was in so much agony and stooped in pain that we were forced to come home. The operation was eventually performed, bringing him much-needed relief, but he never went out again. </p> <p>My brother bore his illness with immense courage and fortitude, never once complaining about the enormous and endless pain from which he suffered. But the doctors, either through misplaced kindness or lack of communication, could not bring themselves to tell him what was wrong and what were his chances of survival. </p> <p>It was obvious to his family that his was a terminal case. Nigel was a heavy smoker, one clear reason for his cancer. But the hospital authorities, maybe fearful of being honest, jocularly suggested that he would come to no harm if he continued to smoke throughout his treatment. If he had realised death was inevitable, he would not have gone through the excruciating charade of fighting for his life. But he used to say: \"While there is a chance, I've got to take it.\" </p> <p>I know his is not an uncommon story. Many cancer patients do not receive the consultation and sometimes the care they deserve, and Nigel's case must be relevant to the experience of numerous people. </p> <p>Here is a problem, moreover, which has the potential to get worse.

      "body": "<p>Ailsa Bernard has been pregnant at least 11 times. Seven pregnancies have ended in miscarriages, three have been ectopic and just one - so far - has resulted in a much-loved daughter, Jessica, now almost five. </p> <p>Every loss has cut her to the quick, each one a potential life lost. But the difference between miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies is that ectopics are dangerous, difficult to diagnose and potentially disastrous. </p> <p>According to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, there has been a dramatic increase in ectopic pregnancies in recent years. An estimated one in 80 pregnancies is now ectopic; 20,000 women are admitted to hospital every year for emergency, life-saving surgery after a pregnancy develops in a fallopian tube, rather than the womb, then ruptures it and causes massive internal haemorrhaging. Between five and eight women die every year either because they are unaware they are pregnant, have been misdiagnosed or have not made it to hospital in time. </p> <p>Ailsa, a 35-year-old housing association worker, had her first ectopic pregnancy in 1988. She found herself doubled up in extreme pain while she was driving to work. She had to fight quite hard to get an appointment with her GP, who finally referred her to hospital where she was admitted instantly and told she needed surgery. </p> <p>Unaware of the serious implications of an ectopic pregnancy, Ailsa told doctors she didn't want to be operated on. The hospital told her she had no choice - without surgery she would die. \"I had not really grasped the enormity of it,\" she says. </p> <p>Surgeons removed part of her right fallopian tube in what was a major operation. (Surgery for ectopic pregnancy often results in the loss of a fallopian tube, thus reducing fertility.) Everyone was concerned about her physical well-being, but little attention was paid to her emotional state. She left hospital with a urine infection and a terrible sense of desolation, having undergone major surgery and lost a baby. </p> <p>After the operation she recalls being told \"it might be a good idea\" if she was checked for chlamydia, though not much more was explained. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection which is dramatically on the increase; if untreated it can cause infertility and it is thought to be responsible for at least half of all ectopic pregnancies. Ailsa was given the details of the local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, but she did not go. \"I was only 23 at the time and I would have felt embarrassed and worried what other people's perceptions of me might be.\" </p> <p>There were more miscarriages, then in 1992 she had just done a positive pregnancy test when she began to suffer stitch-like abdominal pains. \"The pain became worse, but even more than the pain and the bleeding was this very, very strong instinct that something was not right.\" </p> <p>She went to casualty where hospital staff thought it unlikely she had ectopic pregnancy, but agreed to carry out a laparoscopy because of her history. Ailsa was right. Her second ectopic pregnancy was lodged right at the opening of her right hand tube; surgeons removed it and again she was advised about the possible link between chlamydia and ectopic pregnancy, and to go to the GUM clinic. This time she went and she was indeed found to have chlamydia. </p> <p>For Ailsa, it was a relief to have some explanation for why she was losing her pregnancies. She was given a course of antibiotics, and later re-tested to make sure the infection had cleared up. For others however, the revelation that they are suffering from a sexually-transmitted disease which may have wrecked their chances of having a baby opens a whole new area of uncertainty. How did they get it? Was it their current partner?

      "bodyText": "Ailsa Bernard has been pregnant at least 11 times. Seven pregnancies have ended in miscarriages, three have been ectopic and just one - so far - has resulted in a much-loved daughter, Jessica, now almost five. Every loss has cut her to the quick, each one a potential life lost. But the difference between miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies is that ectopics are dangerous, difficult to diagnose and potentially disastrous. According to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, there has been a dramatic increase in ectopic pregnancies in recent years. An estimated one in 80 pregnancies is now ectopic; 20,000 women are admitted to hospital every year for emergency, life-saving surgery after a pregnancy develops in a fallopian tube, rather than the womb, then ruptures it and causes massive internal haemorrhaging. Between five and eight women die every year either because they are unaware they are pregnant, have been misdiagnosed or have not made it to hospital in time. Ailsa, a 35-year-old housing association worker, had her first ectopic pregnancy in 1988. She found herself doubled up in extreme pain while she was driving to work. She had to fight quite hard to get an appointment with her GP, who finally referred her to hospital where she was admitted instantly and told she needed surgery. Unaware of the serious implications of an ectopic pregnancy, Ailsa told doctors she didn't want to be operated on. The hospital told her she had no choice - without surgery she would die. \"I had not really grasped the enormity of it,\" she says. Surgeons removed part of her right fallopian tube in what was a major operation. (Surgery for ectopic pregnancy often results in the loss of a fallopian tube, thus reducing fertility.) Everyone was concerned about her physical well-being, but little attention was paid to her emotional state. She left hospital with a urine infection and a terrible sense of desolation, having undergone major surgery and lost a baby. After the operation she recalls being told \"it might be a good idea\" if she was checked for chlamydia, though not much more was explained. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection which is dramatically on the increase; if untreated it can cause infertility and it is thought to be responsible for at least half of all ectopic pregnancies. Ailsa was given the details of the local genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic, but she did not go. \"I was only 23 at the time and I would have felt embarrassed and worried what other people's perceptions of me might be.\" There were more miscarriages, then in 1992 she had just done a positive pregnancy test when she began to suffer stitch-like abdominal pains. \"The pain became worse, but even more than the pain and the bleeding was this very, very strong instinct that something was not right.\" She went to casualty where hospital staff thought it unlikely she had ectopic pregnancy, but agreed to carry out a laparoscopy because of her history. Ailsa was right. Her second ectopic pregnancy was lodged right at the opening of her right hand tube; surgeons removed it and again she was advised about the possible link between chlamydia and ectopic pregnancy, and to go to the GUM clinic. This time she went and she was indeed found to have chlamydia. For Ailsa, it was a relief to have some explanation for why she was losing her pregnancies. She was given a course of antibiotics, and later re-tested to make sure the infection had cleared up. For others however, the revelation that they are suffering from a sexually-transmitted disease which may have wrecked their chances of having a baby opens a whole new area of uncertainty. How did they get it? Was it their current partner? Where did he get it? According to Peter Greenhouse, consultant in sexual health medicine at Bristol Royal Infirmary, the number of diagnoses of chlamydia has doubled in the last five years; in the last year there has been a 20% increase in teenage women and 23% in teenage men. And, according to two pilot studies whose results will be published early in the New Year, 10% of people under 25 are infected. \"There is no doubt that chlamydia is the main preventable cause of ectopic pregnancy, but what proportion it causes is a matter of debate.

      "body": "<p><strong> My shoulder is frozen</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Q</strong> I have a painful stiff shoulder and can't lift my arm up beyond a few degrees. I can dress, drive and go to work, but it's all an effort and I can't lie on that side so my sleep is disturbed. A friend had a steroid injection for her frozen shoulder but I'm wary. What do you advise? </p> <p><strong> A</strong> When it's working properly, the shoulder has a huge range of movement. But flexibility comes at a price. The joint is easily dislocated and damaged. A thin capsule of tissue surrounds it and small tears make it thicken and become more rigid, which restricts movement. With a frozen shoulder, there is gradual development of pain over a few months, then, as the pain settles, the shoulder stiffens and you lose power and movement of the arm for up to a year. The good news is that after that the shoulder improves. The bad news is that it takes an average of 30 months from start to finish and that treatments do little to alter the outcome. Anti-inflammatory tablets such as Brufen are good in the early stages. Physiotherapyis at least as good as a steroid injection and less likely to cause harm. An operation is probably to be avoided. </p> <p><strong> Heart disease risks</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> Several members of my family have died of heart disease in their 50s and 60s. I asked my GP what I could do to avoid following in their footsteps but was told that apart from not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly and having my blood pressure checked from time to time, there was nothing much. He offered to do a cholesterol blood test. Is there much point? </p> <p><strong> A </strong> There's a lot of point. If your cholesterol level is high with an unhealthily high proportion of the \"bad\" part of cholesterol, LDL, you will be advised to try to reduce it by adopting a low fat diet. This rarely helps much and you may be offered drug treatment with one of a group of drugs known as statins. There is some concern about using statins for more than 10 years. Your risk of developing heart disease over the next 10 years can be calculated taking into account your age, smoking, blood pressure, whether you're diabetic and your cholesterol level. If your risk is above 15%, I'd ask for a statin. Some health authorities are a bit tight with them, only giving them to those with 30% risk or more. But stand your ground if necessary or ask to be referred to the local lipid clinic for an expert opinion. </p> <p><strong> HIV and oral sex</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I have a new partner and am being conscientious in insisting he use condoms when we have sex. Can I catch HIV from oral sex? </p> <p><strong> A </strong> Suprisingly, the answer is \"yes\". The risk after one-off oral sex is low but it has been shown that if you have oral sex with a man who is HIV-positive, you could be at risk. </p> <p><strong> Testing for cancer</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>I've heard there is a blood test for cancer. How can I get one? There's a lot of cancer in my family. </p> <p> <strong>A </strong> The blood test is known as DR-70tm (tumour marker) and is now on sale in Canada and China and soon to find its way to the UK. Its manufacturer, AMDL, an American company, claims it can detect 13 different cancers, including common ones. It's based on the notion that cancer cells release chemicals known as proteases, which can be measured in the blood and from which the type of cancer can be identified. Critics of the test say the scientific evidence is unreliable as it is based on small studies. SureScreen, the company due to market it in the UK, plans to sell it to health professionals rather than directly to the public. Insurance companies may request the test as part of routine health screens - and presumably won't be keen to insure those who test positive. If the test can be proved to be reliable, it is likely to be a useful to early diagnosis of cancers. Until then, the jury's out. </p> <p>These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "bodyText": "Universities probably wouldn't exist if it were not for the support of dubious benefactors. The plundering of monasteries by King Henry VIII helped to build some of the country's most ancient academic institutions. In today's increasingly competitive global higher education market, universities depend more on more on corporate sponsors for their research and teaching budgets. Professorial chairs, research units and entire departments now advertise the names of oil, pharmaceuticals and drinks companies. But for each deal, universities must tread a delicate ethical path. Is academic freedom compromised by the demands of the sponsor? Is the university unwittingly lending authority and crediblity to a company that has abandoned all social responsibilities in the search for profits? In short, what is the company getting out of the deal? By accepting \u00a33.8m from British American Tobacco, which is under investigation over smuggling allegations, Nottingham University has made the wrong choice. The decision to allow BAT to finance a new school of \"business ethics\" has triggered protests from cancer charity officials, anti-smoking campaigners and MPs. The acid test for any sponsorship deal must be whether the commercial donor is willing to remain anonymous, and sign away any rights to influence the outcomes of the work. The publicity over the Nottingham decision can only have benefitted the tobacco manufacturer, which is currently being sued in New York over allegations that it is actively involved in organised crime. But it has damaged the reputation of the university.

He added: \"We look forward to an early conclusion of this inquiry.\"</p> <p>In 1996, following the OFT's last investigation of BSkyB's wholesale programming deals, the company undertook not to bundle certain channels and publish a ratecard with a discount structure agreed in advance with the regulator.</p> <p>The pay-TV operator was also required to submit separate accounts for its retail and wholesale programming businesses. </p> <p>Insiders at ONDigital said that BSkyB's dominant market position has seriously affected margins on the pay-TV services the operation offers.</p> <p>One option would be to drop the price of premium services such as Sky's sports and movie services and boost subscriber numbers.

      "bodyText": "The Office of Fair Trading is to investigate BSkyB's pay-TV channel supply agreements with cable operators and ONdigital to see if they fall foul of the beefed up new Competition Act. The six-month OFT inquiry will consider whether BSkyB's wholesale programming deals with other pay-TV operators amount to either an abuse of a dominant market position or constitute agreements that will damage competition in the UK. An OFT spokesman confirmed that the investigation had not been triggered by a formal complaint, unlike the competition regulator's last major inquiry into BSkyB's wholesale programming business in 1996. The OFT said \"no assumption could be made at this stage that there had been an infringement\". But the spokesman added that for an investigation to be launched there had to be \"reasonable grounds for suspecting that the [Competition Act] has been infringed\". BSkyB rival ONDigital said it welcomed the inquiry. \"This is exactly what we have been asking for,\" said a spokesman. The move follows an OFT review of the undertakings BSkyB gave following the 1996 investigation to meet the regulator's concerns about competition. This inquiry began in January and was prompted by consolidation in the UK cable industry and the launch of digital TV. Now the OFT, under director general John Vickers who took over from John Bridgeman in October, has decided to launch a full inquiry under the terms of the new Competition Act. The Act came into force on March 1 and gives the OFT a beefed up role in policing competition. A BSkyB spokesman said the company noted the transition of the OFT's current inquiry to one under the new legislation. He added: \"We look forward to an early conclusion of this inquiry.\" In 1996, following the OFT's last investigation of BSkyB's wholesale programming deals, the company undertook not to bundle certain channels and publish a ratecard with a discount structure agreed in advance with the regulator. The pay-TV operator was also required to submit separate accounts for its retail and wholesale programming businesses. Insiders at ONDigital said that BSkyB's dominant market position has seriously affected margins on the pay-TV services the operation offers. One option would be to drop the price of premium services such as Sky's sports and movie services and boost subscriber numbers. However, ONdigital is restricted in what it does by prior agreements with Sky.",

The ring-fenced grants of up to \u00a32.6m each come with several strings attached, including a requirement that financially stretched departments cannot use the cash to hide financial problems. The \u00a3100m grant was announced by Mr Milburn yesterday, as it emerged that an official survey had revealed more investment was needed to strengthen health and social services winter planning. The Department of Health's Winter Plan says the \"majority\" of health authority areas have been classified as at \"low to medium risk\" of winter problems. But it added that there was a \"need for additional resources to build extra capacity in some parts of the country, particularly at the interface between health and social services\". And it warned that shortages of social services staff, as well as health staff, was a problem: \"The supply of staff required to deliver the NHS plan cannot be found immediately.\" All social services departments have developed local plans with the NHS to maintain services at peak times during the winter and ensure elderly patients are promptly transferred from acute hospital beds to community care when clinically appropriate. The report did not identify which areas had been assessed as \"high risk\" of service problems developing over the next few weeks. The extra \u00a3100m has been added as a top-up to the Promoting Independence grants announced earlier this year and will be paid directly to those councils that can demonstrate the money will be used effectively. A DoH letter to local authority chief executives warns that the grants, which range from \u00a3332,000 (Merton) to \u00a32.65m (Kent) cannot be used to ease general social services budget deficits. It says councils will also have to demonstrate specific improvements in service delivery and performance, and effective joint plans with the NHS and other partners.

It says that early indications show there has been an increase of 2,900 intensive home care packages in the year to September 2000, and 6,700 more local authority supported places in residential and nursing homes in the 12 months to March 2000. Although the private care homes sector cut 7,300 beds in 1999-2000, ministers insist that its investment in intermediate care will \"more than offset\" this reduction.",

News of the latest development - which has prompted the Dalai Lama to postpone a visit to Taiwan - emerged following celebrations at the temple outside the Dalai Lama's chalet-style home in Dharamsala, a former Raj hill resort surrounded by snowy mountains in the foothills of the Himalayas. The Dalai Lama was made political leader at the age of 16, soon after the Chinese began their invasion of Tibet in 1950.

As the seat rises, my guts remain on the ground, and as we hit the top and the machine decelerates and starts falling rapidly, I keep on going up. My bum floats off the seat as my shoulders are rammed into the restraints, and I have the conviction that I'm about to be thrown to the ground. I have just experienced the thrust of a shuttle launch and had a moment's weightlessness thrown in for good measure. </p> <p>I am in Huntsville, Alabama - home to the space academy at Nasa's US Space &amp; Rocket Center, one of the few places on Earth where a civilian can get a feel of what it's like to train as an astronaut. Ever since the Apollo programme made getting to the moon appear simple, Nasa has had an ongoing funding battle with Congress, and it has launched a charm offensive. Space tourism is this year's thing, as the sign over the academy's entrance makes clear: \"The men and women who come through these doors are our astronauts of tomorrow.\" </p> <p>If anyone can be said to embody the wrong stuff, it's me. I suffer from vertigo, I'm frightened of flying, I don't believe the US is the land of the free and the home of the brave and my mum's apple pie is anything but sweet. Or home-made. </p> <p>I'm issued with a set of pale blue overalls; they are short of the full spacesuit and helmet that I'd hoped for, but when I check them against the in-flight wear of the astronauts going in the orbiter (the correct name for the shuttle), they look authentic. After this, things go downhill as I'm shown to my living quarters for the weekend. A windowless cabin may give a good feel of life aboard the space station, but for a neurotic with jet-lag it's a no-go area. </p> <p>We're hustled into a briefing room to be given a brief run through of the history and the technical achievements of the US space programme. The latter involves a heavy use of acronyms, such as SRBs (solid rocket boosters) and SSME (space shuttle main engine). </p> <p>Thankfully, the pace picks up as we move on to the main training area where there are mock-ups and in-flight simulators of the orbiter, the space station and mission control, and we take turns to role-play key personnel in a series of missions. I start off as the launch/landing director, before moving on to command the orbiter; I am hopelessly miscast, being surrounded by banks of computer screens with buttons and switches that mean nothing to me. </p> <p>We're given a script to follow, and dutifully read out commands and key sequences into the computers, without understanding what we're doing. Occasionally, if everything is ticking over smoothly, the trainers will send a glitch into the system and we scroll through a selection of profiles to try to identify the anomaly and fix it. </p> <p>Mysteriously, we bring the orbiter back to earth. Which is more than can be said for those I left behind on the space station, thanks to an early deployment of the docking gear. Well, at least I'm back safe and sound. The others will just have to hang on in there until 2001. </p> <p>It rapidly dawns on me that being an astronaut is actually 99 parts scientific and technical excellence, boredom and claustrophobia to one part glamour and adrenalin. But what glamour and what adrenalin. When it comes to advanced theme-park rides, Nasa leaves Alton Towers for dead. </p> <p>Weightlessness is the sine qua non of the space experience, but it is almost impossible to replicate in the Earth's atmosphere. Nasa puts its real astronauts through a series of steep parabolic loops in an aircraft known as the vomit comet; luckily this is not on offer. Instead I get to experience the feeling of microgravity in the one-sixth gravity chair that was developed to train the Apollo astronauts how to walk on the moon. </p> <p>Watching astronauts bounding easily over the lunar surface, I had imagined the sense of liberation that microgravity must bring. Far from it. With little gravitational resistance, my early efforts to make forward movement leave me bouncing on the spot like a marionette. With a little practice I eventually cover about 100m in a series of out-of-control bunny-hops, side-steps and slo-mo sprints, but by the end of it I'm feeling knackered. I also wonder whether zero gravity might be all it's cracked up to be. After the first few hours of revelling in the magic of weightlessness, the loss of perspective must become disorienting and tiring. Not to mention the physical effects of decalcification of the bones. </p> <p>Next, we are moved along to the centrifuge. An astronaut in space might experience 7g of force or more but, despite having completed a medical check prior to entering the academy, we're kept down to several minutes of 4g, as Nasa isn't keen to pay for civilian popped eyeballs, spontaneous bleeding or heart arrhythmia. Even so, 4g is plenty; as the centrifuge hits top speed my body starts to feel heavy as I'm pinned back. My throat tightens as if I'm being strangled, and my face feels as if it is being smeared on the wall. </p> <p>Pottering around in the 5DF (five degrees of freedom) and the MMU (manned manoeuvring unit), performing simulated EVAs (extra vehicular activities) is as close to the sublime space experience as I get. Strapped into a chair attached to a long arm of something that resembles a giant floating industrial floor-polisher, I swing through five axes of roll, pitch and yaw as I repair a crucial radio mast for the good of humanity. </p> <p>But to get the full \"where the hell am I?\" experience, you have to try the multi-axis trainer. This is a chair suspended within two concrete hoops that spins rapidly through every possible axis. All I was conscious of was a series of blurred images as the walls, ceiling and floor smashed into a single vision, and a vague sense of surprise that I wasn't throwing up. </p> <p>After my performance on the launch pad, I'm not expecting the call from Nasa, but even if I had excelled I don't think I would be in too much of a hurry to go. Three months is a long time in space; the trainer makes much of the fact that inflight cuisine has improved out of all recognition, but the dried peaches still taste like flavoured ceiling tiles. </p> <p>OK, so there's every satellite TV station you could possibly want, but you know what? Even though you're several hundred miles removed from several billion people, you've got astronauts floating past your nose when you're trying to get to sleep. Even space is overcrowded these days. </p> <p>\u0095 Inside the Space Station will be broadcast on the Discovery Channel on December 10.</p>",

Ms Boycott's email distanced herself from the payments and tried to inject some calm in the stormy atmosphere that has developed at Ludgate House.

      "bodyText": "A leading British university was asked last night to scrap plans to accept \u00a33.8m from British American Tobacco, which is under investigation over smuggling allegations, to finance a school of business ethics. Nottingham University's decision triggered protests from a cancer charity and anti-smoking campaigners as the chairman of the Commons health committee called for it to be reviewed. BAT, the world's second biggest tobacco company will, over three years, help Nottingham create what is billed as the country's first international centre for corporate social responsibility - a claim disputed by Warwick University which established its Corporate Citizenship Unit in 1996 with support from BP. Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of cancer in Britain, killing an estimated 120,000 people a year, and Nottingham University has a strict no smoking policy. BAT is the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into evidence that it exploited smuggling around the world. The Cancer Research Campaign, which funds research at Nottingham, claimed the university had \"sold out\" while the anti-smoking group ASH branded the support \"blood money\". Nottingham was urged to reverse the decision by David Hinchliffe, chairman of the Commons health committee which this year issued a damning report into the activities of tobacco companies and recommended the government inquiry into BAT. \"I'm astonished in view of the current DTI investigation and the evidence put to our committee about BAT's activities that a British university has entered into such an agreement,\" said Mr Hinchliffe. University officials said there had been a lot of \"soul searching\" as Sir Colin Campbell, Nottingham's vice-chancellor, said nationally-agreed guidelines on commercial funding had been followed. \"BAT is working hard to address the changing expectations of society and its stakeholders. It has a genuine commitment to engaging constructively, and to supporting higher education and the development of the management skills base in the countries where it operates,\" he said. Sir Colin served on a Home Office inquiry into police pay in the early 1990s headed by Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT's then chairman. BAT is the only big donor to agree to fund the corporate social responsibility centre which will have a professorial chair or directorship as well as visiting professors from the developing world and scholarships for students from developing countries. Discussions continue over whether the posts will be named after the firm. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, sent inspectors into BAT after the Guardian published company documents showing how it exploited and profited from smuggling in South America and Asia. BAT, along with Philip Morris, is being sued in New York over allegations that it is actively involved in organised crime. The companies are contesting accusations of widespread smuggling and money laundering in an anti-racketeering writ filed by a consortium of Colombian states. Ken Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and health secretary now paid \u00a3100,000 a year as BAT deputy chairman, is a Nottinghamshire MP and supported the deal. Nottingham's acceptance of BAT's cash has also reopened the debate over the ethics of universities accepting funding from big businesses for specific posts. Oxford allows Rupert Murdoch to fund a chair in English and a visiting professorship in broadcast media while Cambridge has a Shell chair in chemical engineering, ICI a chair in applied thermodynamics, Glaxo a chair of molecular parasitology, Unilever a chair of molecular science, PricewaterhouseCoopers a chair of financial accounting, Marks &amp; Spencer a chair of farm animal health and BP professorships in organic chemistry and petroleum science. Cambridge was involved in a similar controversy four years ago when it accepted \u00a31.5m from BAT to found a Patrick Sheehy chair of international relations to mark the retirement of the tobacco firm's chairman. BAT denies any involvement with smuggling and Michael Prideaux, the company's director of corporate affairs, said: \"Along with others, we are working hard to address both the changing expectations of multinational companies, and the issues surrounding our industry. \"We are serious about demonstrating responsible behaviour in an industry seen as controversial.\" Clive Bates, director of the ASH anti-smoking campaign, said: \"This kind of expenditure by BAT is a brazen attempt to buy respectability.

The inquiry centres on a former chaplain and governor at the Roman Catholic state school in Fulham, south-west London, at which Prime Minister Tony Blair's two eldest sons are pupils.

She refused to discuss the case further, but said: \"As a journalist, I have received for years letters making allegations against priests working in the Roman Catholic church, so I am very aware of the problem. \"I also know that this does occur from time to time in schools and I know how difficult it is to investigate these circumstances when they occur in schools,\" she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"Children who are sexually abused are very often frightened, guilty and ashamed and take the blame on themselves. \"When this happens inside a school, they often feel that they have to protect even their own parents, who sent them there for their own good, and they don't want to hurt their parents by revealing what has happened. \"So there are a great deal of areas in which we need to reassure children in order to ensure the truth comes out.\" A spokeswoman for Hammersmith and Fulham council confirmed that a child protection team investigation was under way. As school chaplain, Martin was employed by the church, not the school, so it is not clear whether he was subject to police checks before working with pupils, she said. Martin entered the priesthood as a novice in 1988 after a 10-year career as a stockbroker in the City of London, the Daily Mail reported. He was ordained by the late Cardinal Basil Hume, archbishop of Westminster, in 1994. Martin died four years later from bronchopneumonia in the hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Westminster. The 1,360-pupil Catholic boys' school, which admits girls in the sixth form, was founded by the Fathers of the London Oratory in 1863.",

Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW), Richard Li's internet and telecoms company, said it was reducing spending on business-to-consumer projects by \u00a3208m a year. Mr Li, son of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-Shing, had originally planned to invest \u00a31.036m in NOW over five years. Today's announcement will mean almost certain redundancies at the west London operation, which employs 350 people. The company is a joint venture between PCCW and TV and online producer Trans World International. PCCW originally revealed in October that it would be reducing its NOW funding, following a drastic fall in its share price. The company is scaling back its total financial commitment to NOW and other ventures from \u00a3346m to \u00a3138m annually, but declined to give further details of how much NOW's budget would be cut or how this would impact on jobs and the level of service. Alex Arena, PCCW deputy chairman, said the company could justify spending less on NOW because competition for content had diminished in recent months as the market valuations of internet companies tumbled globally. Mr Arena added: \"The internet market as a whole is no longer moving as fast as it was in terms of the number of competitors and the amount of money that they're spending, so we can maintain our headstart without having to invest at the same rate.\" NOW launched in June, offering five themed web portals and an Asian satellite TV channel based around the same mix of content.

      "body": "<p>The asylum claims of women who face persecution abroad because they are openly lesbian, express feminist views or have been victims of sexual abuse or domestic violence will be given full consideration by immigration judges under new anti-discrimination guidelines. </p> <p>The new \"gender guidelines\" for asylum cases, to be launched today by the human rights lawyer Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws, will not mean that any woman who has been a victim of domestic violence abroad can get refugee status in Britain, but it will ensure that their cases are not dismissed at the first hurdle as they have often been. </p> <p>The new rules will give protection to men as well as women and stress the difficulties that both face in giving evidence of rape and sexual abuse to the immigration authorities. Asylum rights lawyers say that many men who have been sexually assaulted while in detention find it difficult to talk about the experience. </p> <p>\"We are trying to move away from the idea that a refugee is only a young single male who has been involved in party politics in opposition to the gov ernment of his country,\" Catriona Jarvis, an immigration appeals adjudicator who co-authored the new guidelines, said yesterday. \"That narrow view is being extended to include those who become the victims of forced prostitution, and those who are forced to dress in a particular way or openly express feminist opinions. The 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees is a living instrument and must change to meet the needs of those who require international protection.\" </p> <p>Asylum lawyers welcomed the guidelines as \"a great step forward\" in acknowledging that there were different types of asylum seekers and said Britain was finally catching up with America, Canada and Australia, which operate similar guidelines. </p> <p>But the guidelines, which are to be issued through the Lord Chancellor's Department, may prove an embarrassment to the home secretary, Jack Straw, who last October criticised the law lords for being \"over-liberal\" in backing the cases of two Pakistani women who lived in fear of domestic violence. He said there was \"no way it can be realistically argued that that was in contemplation when the 1951 convention was put in place\". A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed it had now accepted the House of Lords ruling. </p> <p>Mr Justice Collins, president of the immigration appeals tribunal, defended the new guidelines, saying they had the support of the UN as well campaigning groups such as the Refugee Women's Legal Group. </p> <p>\"A great deal of work has gone into producing this valuable document. The guidelines provide a useful tool to assist the immigration judiciary, asylum caseworkers, asylum applicants, and their representatives in ensuring that the gender aspects of asylum claims are fully considered.\" </p> <p>The guidelines recognise that because the 1951 convention was drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war, the dominant image of what constitutes a refugee in law has been that of a man, and women have not been able to benefit equally from its protection. They also recognise that there are forms of persecution that apply specifically to women, including bride burning, forced sterilisation, genital mutilation, and refusal of access to contraception. In some countries a woman may be flogged for refusing to wear a veil. </p> <p>Alison Stanley of the solicitors Bindman's, and a member of the Refugee Women's Legal Group, said the guidelines acknowledged that simple acts such as washing up, passing messages, or providing food and shelter might be regarded as political acts by some regimes if those who were helped were freedom fighters.</p>",

The new \"gender guidelines\" for asylum cases, to be launched today by the human rights lawyer Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws, will not mean that any woman who has been a victim of domestic violence abroad can get refugee status in Britain, but it will ensure that their cases are not dismissed at the first hurdle as they have often been. The new rules will give protection to men as well as women and stress the difficulties that both face in giving evidence of rape and sexual abuse to the immigration authorities. Asylum rights lawyers say that many men who have been sexually assaulted while in detention find it difficult to talk about the experience. \"We are trying to move away from the idea that a refugee is only a young single male who has been involved in party politics in opposition to the gov ernment of his country,\" Catriona Jarvis, an immigration appeals adjudicator who co-authored the new guidelines, said yesterday. \"That narrow view is being extended to include those who become the victims of forced prostitution, and those who are forced to dress in a particular way or openly express feminist opinions. The 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees is a living instrument and must change to meet the needs of those who require international protection.\" Asylum lawyers welcomed the guidelines as \"a great step forward\" in acknowledging that there were different types of asylum seekers and said Britain was finally catching up with America, Canada and Australia, which operate similar guidelines. But the guidelines, which are to be issued through the Lord Chancellor's Department, may prove an embarrassment to the home secretary, Jack Straw, who last October criticised the law lords for being \"over-liberal\" in backing the cases of two Pakistani women who lived in fear of domestic violence. He said there was \"no way it can be realistically argued that that was in contemplation when the 1951 convention was put in place\". A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed it had now accepted the House of Lords ruling. Mr Justice Collins, president of the immigration appeals tribunal, defended the new guidelines, saying they had the support of the UN as well campaigning groups such as the Refugee Women's Legal Group. \"A great deal of work has gone into producing this valuable document. The guidelines provide a useful tool to assist the immigration judiciary, asylum caseworkers, asylum applicants, and their representatives in ensuring that the gender aspects of asylum claims are fully considered.\" The guidelines recognise that because the 1951 convention was drawn up in the aftermath of the second world war, the dominant image of what constitutes a refugee in law has been that of a man, and women have not been able to benefit equally from its protection. They also recognise that there are forms of persecution that apply specifically to women, including bride burning, forced sterilisation, genital mutilation, and refusal of access to contraception. In some countries a woman may be flogged for refusing to wear a veil. Alison Stanley of the solicitors Bindman's, and a member of the Refugee Women's Legal Group, said the guidelines acknowledged that simple acts such as washing up, passing messages, or providing food and shelter might be regarded as political acts by some regimes if those who were helped were freedom fighters.",

Perhaps they did not know. </p> <p>His final indignity in this traumatic period occurred barely a month before he died. With extreme difficulty he hauled himself out of his bed to attend a regular appointment at Milton Keynes hospital. On arrival he waited two hours for the results of a blood test. They never came. He was then informed by a doctor that his notes had been lost and that he should come back in two months. Shaking with rage and shattered at the callous reaction, his poor wife blazed out: \"You can't possibly see him again. In two months he'll be dead.\" </p> <p>Several months after he finally passed away came a further example of the appalling lack of organisation and concern at Milton Keynes when his widow took a call from the hospital. \"We're just checking up on Mr Harper and to see whether he needs another apppointment.\" </p> <p>My brother Nigel had cancer of the neck. At his death, his entire body was a shell, riddled with disease. His weight had almost halved: as his illness developed, eating had become progressively more difficult. He barely picked at his food and kept himself going mainly with liquids. To help him eat, the hospital suggested that a shunt could be inserted into his stomach so that he could be fed intravenously. It is a simple operation and a proposal to which, as always, he willingly agreed, even though people who have experienced the procedure will know the results are not always straightforward and far from comfortable. The patient, usually asleep, lies in bed and slowly receives nourishment directly into the stomach over a period of hours. </p> <p>Once again the hospital let him down, as he braced himself to take this next hurdle. On the day the shunt was due to be inserted, he arrived for the operation only to be told that a mistake had been made and that it could not go ahead. </p> <p>I was about to take him on a final visit to some of his favourite haunts, among them the Lakes and the Beaulieu motor museum in Hampshire. \"Good idea, it'll do him good,\" said the hospital. But the opposite was the case. We had to abandon the trip halfway up the M6. He was in so much agony and stooped in pain that we were forced to come home. The operation was eventually performed, bringing him much-needed relief, but he never went out again. </p> <p>My brother bore his illness with immense courage and fortitude, never once complaining about the enormous and endless pain from which he suffered. But the doctors, either through misplaced kindness or lack of communication, could not bring themselves to tell him what was wrong and what were his chances of survival. </p> <p>It was obvious to his family that his was a terminal case. Nigel was a heavy smoker, one clear reason for his cancer. But the hospital authorities, maybe fearful of being honest, jocularly suggested that he would come to no harm if he continued to smoke throughout his treatment. If he had realised death was inevitable, he would not have gone through the excruciating charade of fighting for his life. But he used to say: \"While there is a chance, I've got to take it.\" </p> <p>I know his is not an uncommon story. Many cancer patients do not receive the consultation and sometimes the care they deserve, and Nigel's case must be relevant to the experience of numerous people. </p> <p>Here is a problem, moreover, which has the potential to get worse. One in three people in the United Kingdom are expected to develop cancer at some stage in their life. Precluding dramatic advances in cancer prevention, it is estimated that this figure will rise to one in two by the year 2020. </p> <p>My brother's experience struck immediate chords with the national charity Cancerlink, which exists to provide people affected by cancer with access to support. It is currently campaigning for improved communication between cancer patients and health professionals. </p> <p>Its chair, Professor Jessica Corner, director of the centre for cancer and palliative care studies at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, is disturbed at the communication breakdown at Milton Keynes. She says that if Nigel's notes were mislaid, he should have had a consultation without them. </p> <p>On the general subject of care, she admits that it is only relatively recently that the right to be told that you have cancer has become generally accepted. \"Even now in some parts of the UK, you cannot assume that someone has been told their diagnosis, especially if the prognosis is poor.\" Her experience is that cancer is discussed in veiled terms. People are often informed in surgical clinics that they have a lump or growth that needs to be removed, and they are still all too often left to decipher quite what this means. </p> <p>Walking through her own local hospital, a large and famous London institution, leaves her with a sense of being present in body, but having left herself, her spirit, all that is impor tant in life, at home. \"Combine this with a cancer diagnosis, with all the emotional and physical trauma and upheaval it entails, and the feelings of isolation and exclusion from one's normal world must magnify exponentially.\" </p> <p>Corner says it should be remembered that communicating to a patient that they will die is a formidable task for some doctors, and that they need to be provided with special communication skills if they do not naturally possess them. She believes that, in many hospitals, sensitivity around cancer diagnosis has greatly improved, not from within the medical profession but from research studies revealing the inadequacy of care for patients' emotional needs. </p> <p>My brother's experience is a stark reminder that the future for cancer services and for the NHS is to find better methods of offering support, and to use the experience of patients to change and enhance the system. Corner argues for the fostering of a new relationship with patients, one that encompasses partnership and collaboration, so that illness becomes mutual inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Chi sar\u00e0 il prossimo ad uscire? Pietro, Salvo, Rocco, Cristina o Antonietta? Questa la domanda che angoscia i dieci milioni di spettatori del Grande Fratello, il programma televisivo pi\u00f9 discusso dell'anno. Da settembre, dieci volontari, dai 22 ai 35 anni, sono autoreclusi in una confortevole \"casa\" televisiva, con tanto di giardinetto e piscina. La sfida \u00e8 resisterci cento giorni, isolati dal resto del mondo, ma osservati da tutti. Trenta telecamere riprendono tutto ci\u00f2 che succede nel bunker e lo trasmettono 24 ore su 24 su un canale televisivo criptato e su un sito Internet. Un canale nazionale trasmette episodi selezionati un'ora il pomeriggio e la sera. Ogni quindici giorni uno dei ragazzi \"esce\". L'eliminazione \u00e8 decisa da spettatori e navigatori in Internet, che scelgono fra due nomi proposti dagli stessi compagni di prigionia. L'uscita, con baci, abbracci, pianti e interviste avviene il gioved\u00ec sera. Ci sar\u00e0 un unico vincitore, che intascher\u00e0 il premio di 250 milioni. L'inizio \u00e8 stato intrigante, con un discutissimo amplesso semi-nascosto dalle tende, poi sono prevalse banalit\u00e0 e noia. Ora domina il nervosismo. Il pubblico comunque aumenta e anche gli scettici confessano di dare qualche sbirciatina \"Quando non ho altro da fare\". Ne parlano i giornali, fioccano i pareri di psicologi, intellettuali, politici, nascono le satire. Come resistere? D: Guardi Il Grande Fratello? Massimiliano, 15 - Lo guardo quando non ho niente di pi\u00f9 interessante da fare. \u00c8 un programma nuovo e mi piace curiosare e vedere come si comportano le persone all'interno della casa. Giancarlo, 17 - Chi segue il Grande Fratello in famiglia \u00e8 mio fratello piccolo, che ha dieci anni! Io lo guardo solo ogni tanto. Rossella 16 - Mi serve da riempitivo quando non so cosa fare. Devo ammettere che sono curiosa di sapere cosa \u00e8 successo. Non mi perdo la serata in cui esce chi \u00e8 stato escluso. Sabrina, 18 - Ho cominciato a guardarlo con entusiasmo, pensavo potesse diventare una specie di Friends casareccio . Poi ho cominciato ad annoiarmi. I ragazzi non hanno iniziativa, non sanno organizzarsi, ognuno cerca solo di rendersi simpatico con la speranza di vincere. D: Che giudizio ne dai? Massimiliano - \u00c8 un programma senza contenuti particolari, costruito per fare audience, ma \u00e8 anche l'argomento di conversazione del giorno. A scuola chi non conosce gli ultimi avvenimenti \u00e8 tagliato fuori! Giancarlo - C'\u00e8 un lato simpatico, perch\u00e9 i protagonisti sono ragazzi, ma il lato negativo \u00e8 che pi\u00f9 che il Grande Fratello si tratta del Grande Vuoto.

Rossella - \u00c8 un programma di genere nuovo, ma non spontaneo come vogliono far credere. La sensazione \u00e8 che molto venga suggerito da \"fuori\". D: Cosa pensi dei ragazzi all'interno della \"casa?\" Massimiliano - Penso che stiano facendo un'esperienza nuova, ma anche che soffrano. \u00c8 brutto non avere contatti con gli amici, la famiglia e la vita intorno a noi.

      "bodyText": "He made his name by splattering the catwalk with blood, insects, skulls and human hair and Alexander McQueen yesterday once again shocked the world of high fashion by joining the home of the luxury handbag, Gucci. After months of rows with his bosses at Givenchy, McQueen has signed a partnership deal with their bitter rivals - leaving the French fashion house, where he remains head designer, reeling. Yesterday Gucci said the deal would develop the small, independent Alexander McQueen label - in which it will hold a 51% stake - into the the Italian group's third major brand after the house label and Yves St-Laurent. McQueen, who comes from the East End of London, entered fashion as a tailors' apprentice at the age of 16, becoming king of the catwalk in the nineties. He is known for combining shock tactics with consummate tailoring skill. He invented the \"bumster\" trousers, named an early collection Highland Rape and used the model Aimee Mullins, who has a prosthetic leg. But alongside the controversy, he has produced increasingly wearable clothes. His signature is the strong-shouldered suit, a look honed and refined over the years. His clothes have found favour with stars such as Kate Moss, Kate Winslet and Gwyneth Paltrow. Many saw his decision to join Givenchy in 1996 as the creation of a \"dream team\" but it has proved otherwise. Industry insiders are already speculating on his future at the fashion house, where he reportedly feels creatively constrained by the parent company, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, and its charismatic boss, Bernard Arnault. The avant garde designer has long been at odds with Givenchy's penchant for traditional elegance. Last month, McQueen told Arena magazine that he felt there were \"too many cooks\" at the French house, adding that LVMH had refused him permission either to leave or to take charge as he wished. Directing his comments at Givenchy senior executives, he said: \"I'm here and stay here till the end of my contract but I'm taking control of it from now on. Otherwise fire me! Because that's what I wanted anyway.\" LVMH, which is already embroiled in an unrelated bitter legal wrangle with Gucci, has been put in an impossible position, industry sources said last night. At the very least, Givenchy is banking on McQueen to unveil its couture collection in six weeks. He is also contracted to produce another couture and two ready-to-wear collections before his contract officially expires in October next year. Some have suggested that the provocative move could be designed to shake McQueen from his contractual obligations to LVMH, leaving him free to take a central role at the Gucci label itself. The man behind the Italian group's look, Tom Ford, is said to be taking an increasingly strategic position and is working to regenerate Yves St-Laurent. In a joint statement yesterday, the designer and Gucci announced that the new Alexander McQueen label would be 51% owned by the Italian group, with McQueen holding the balance. One City analyst said that Gucci's stake in the label, which last year had turnover of $5m, was likely to be worth less than $10m. \"The future of Alexander McQueen is incredibly important to me and I believe that this partnership will prove a success,\" McQueen said of his label. Rubbing salt into LVMH wounds, the Gucci president and chief executive, Domenico De Sole, revealed that his company had been in talks with McQueen for \"several months\". Speaking later from New York, De Sole said: \"Alexander will enjoy full and complete freedom. There is no alternative to that. We will respect his creative talents and help him develop the business side.\" He also promised to fund shops in New York, Paris, Milan and Tokyo to add to McQueen's existing outlet in London's West End.

      "bodyText": "The government will tomorrow unveil its fourth Queen's speech - promising a full legislative programme with the fight against crime at its heart. There will be measures on \"the priority areas\" that the government believes matter to the people of Britain - crime, health, education and welfare reform. Much of the attention will be on the Prime Minister's attempt to tackle youth crime and take forward the responsibility agenda. Most attention has so far centred on expected powers for police to impose curfews on youngsters as young as 10. Other will be included in a new Police and Criminal Justice Bill, while health measures will centre on implementing the NHS Plan, unveiled earlier this year - with extra resources targeted at the government's priorities. Also likely to be included is a Bill to require house sellers to prepare a special pack costing around \u00a3600 to include a search and survey - usually the responsibility of buyers. The aim is to streamline England's cumbersome and sometimes costly house purchasing system. Anti-hunting pressure groups will be eagerly awaiting details of a Hunting Bill, expected to outline a series of options to tackle the issue. The Queen's speech tomorrow will effectively mark the last session of parliament and will be the last chance for Labour to push ahead its modernisation programme under this current parliament. The key legislative announcements for the public and voluntary sectors are likely to be as follows: Social care \u2022Align Adoption Act with Children's Act to ensure child's welfare is at the forefront \u2022Promoting adoption for looked-after children \u2022Increase in post adoption support by making clear legal duties for Local Authorities Health \u2022Legislation to enact the NHS plan including the creation of care trusts \u2022Measures to give local authorities formal powers of scrutiny over local health services Local government \u2022New duties on education authorities to support children with special educational needs \u2022Measures to give local authorities formal powers of scrutiny over local health services Housing \u2022Councils to have a general duty to rehouse homeless people as a result of the repeal of the homelessness legislation introduced in 1996",

The ITV giant said ad revenue had fallen since a disastrous October, and admitted that \"the television advertising market is currently subdued.\" Arch-rival Granada Media has also suffered from an advertising slump, and both companies have received a drubbing on the stock market as fears mount of a continued downturn in revenue. However, Carlton's full-year results showed a rise in pre-tax profits from \u00a3317m to \u00a3342m on turnover of just over \u00a32bn, up from last year's \u00a31.97bn. Gerry Murphy, chief executive of Carlton, said the company was \"making progress on all fronts\", including its ONdigital joint venture with Granada Media, which has nearly reached 1m subscribers.

ONdigital continues to be a heavy investment for both Carlton and Granada, with Carlton reporting a loss of \u00a3143.2m on the joint venture. A much-touted flotation was effectively shelved last week when Granada boss Charles Allen said an IPO would reduce the value of the company.

The Football Association has charged him with misconduct following the physical Premiership game at Leeds nine days ago. </p> <p>Vieira, who has served a five-match suspension this season after two sendings-off had brought his red cards at Arsenal to six, was charged after the FA's video advisory panel had studied incidents with two Leeds players, Eirik Bakke and Olivier Dacourt.

While Dacourt has insisted that his fellow Frenchman did not mean to kick him in the throat Bakke has told a Norwegian newspaper that \"the head-butting was not the only thing Vieira did to me in that game\". </p> <p>Wenger, who himself is appealing against a 12-match touchline ban imposed for an alleged shove on the fourth official at Sunderland on the opening day, said: \"I do not believe the Football Association has made the right decision.

I also note that the FA has acted on advice from the video panel and not the referee.

      "bodyText": "The BBC board of governors have been lambasted by one of Britain's most senior clerics the day after the resignation of Ernest Rea, head of religion and ethics. James Jones, the Bishop of Liverpool, has branded the board, led by Sir Christopher Bland, as \"prejudiced\". And he calls Rev Rea's departure as \"a disaster for religious broadcasting and a triumph for philistines\". In a stinging attack in the Daily Telegraph, the bishop accused the BBC governors of \"prejudice\" in \"dismembering, dismantling and devaluing... religion in public service broadcasting\". Bishop Jones accused broadcasters of deviously scheduling religious programmes later and later, reducing audience ratings and marginalising religion as a whole. The BBC's Heart of the Matter, which was being broadcast at 11.30pm before it was axed, was a case in point, he said. The bishop added that the BBC's plans to switch religious programming on to BBC2 would not necessarily result in failure, but added that \"the track record does not inspire confidence\". He noted that the \"contrast between BBC radio and television could not be greater\". In a pointed attack on the marginalisation of religion within the BBC power structure, he said the success of religion on radio was \"a result of the positive and enlightened attitude of the controller to scheduling and budgeting; the ability of the producers; and the interest of a popular audience in the breadth of religious issues.\" The bishop's attack comes months after the BBC's religious TV was branded as \"trite\" by church leaders. Rev Rea, who resigned yesterday, attacked both Greg Dyke and BBC2 controller Jane Root for failing to commission and promote religious programming.",

The FA should hope for Leeds to win because they are an English club.\" </p> <p>While the Italian journalists were concerned about the match fitness of Juan Veron, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Angelo Peruzzi, their English counterparts were much more interested in what Eriksson had had to say to the England caretaker coach Peter Taylor after Leicester City had beaten Leeds 3-1 on Saturday. </p> <p>\"I spoke to Peter Taylor after his win against Leeds but only for a couple of minutes,\" Eriksson said. \"You see, we sent my assistant Luciano Spinosi to watch the Leicester-Leeds game and I spoke much more to him than to Peter Taylor about Leeds but not, of course, because Spinosi knows more about Leeds than Taylor.\" </p> <p>Taylor had dealt more abruptly with a similar line of questioning. \"Nothing was said about Leeds,\" Leicester's manager told a reporter at the weekend. \"It is an understatement to say that I am annoyed about what has been suggested.\" </p> <p>The Leeds manager David O'Leary was also subjected to questions about the England job but he dealt with them swiftly. \"I'm not interested in England, in David O'Leary putting one over the England manager or any of that rubbish,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>\"If you come into a job like this you get big games all the time. If he wins it's great for him. If he loses he's in trouble: he has to go to the England manager's job.\" </p> <p>Eriksson also tried to keep his interlocutors concentrated on tonight's business but the questions kept looking forward to the new year. </p> <p>Was it true that Lazio and the FA had reached an agreement to free him for England's March World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania? \"No, that's not true. I haven't discussed this question yet. That is for February.\" </p> <p>Has it been difficult combining his current and future roles? \"No. I'm lucky. I have sent my right-hand man, Tord Grip, to England to take over for me. Tord is doing the job for me and that leaves me free to concentrate totally on Lazio.\" </p> <p>Then, in response to yet another question about his future should Lazio lose tonight, Eriksson replied: \"That is such a negative question. I don't think about losing. If I lose, maybe I'll think about it the day after. Anyway I am the Lazio manager whatever happens tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Whatever happens, England will probably have to wait until next July. Two factors have banished the storm clouds that only a week ago appeared to be gathering over the genial Swede's head. </p> <p>First, Lazio have picked up important Italian Cup and league wins against Udinese and Reggina in the past week. Secondly, the Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti has made it abundantly clear that he expects Eriksson to see out his contract. </p> <p>Club owners, of course, have been known to change their minds. Yet, while Lazio remain on course in the Champions League, the Italian Cup and the Serie A title races, Eriks- son seems certain to keep his job. </p> <p>Furthermore a Lazio side that finally appears to be rediscovering its championship-winning form may well do Eriksson a big favour tonight by beating Leeds. </p> <p>The Argentine playmaker Veron seems likely to play, despite a four-week-old hairline fracture in his left shin, but the Yugoslav central defender Mihajlovic and the goalkeeper Peruzzi face fitness tests and the noises were not optimistic. </p> <p>As Eriksson expressed the wish that Veron \"plays at least 60 minutes of real Veron\", reporters' eyes glazed over, their sights patriotically fixed on World Cup matches far away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "America's most senior judges yesterday handed George W Bush a limited victory in his battle for the White House, but backed away from making themselves the final arbiters of the outcome of the US presidential election. The US supreme court's ruling set aside last month's decision of the Florida supreme court to extend the recount phase of the election. But at the same time, the ruling asked the Florida justices to look again at the reasoning behind their decision, in effect offering the state court a second chance to keep the matter out of the federal court's hands. The latest decision means that Mr Bush's lead over Al Gore in the Florida presidential election is returned to the 930-vote margin which existed before a recount in Broward county reduced it to 537 votes. But it took no position on Mr Bush's bigger claim that the Florida court had overstepped the constitution by extending the recount phase, and it left Al Gore's legal \"contest\" actions against the Florida results untouched, at least until local judges had had time to digest the implications of the Washington ruling. The ruling leaves Mr Gore and Mr Bush free to continue their sparring in the Florida courts, and suggests that the supreme court might be more concerned to preserve its own public unanimity in dealing with such a partisan issue than to venture in with a more sweeping ruling telling all the lower courts how to interpret the law. The court in Washington issued an unsigned, and thus apparently unanimous, finding which \"vacated\" the Florida court's earlier ruling on the dispute. On November 21, the Florida supreme court had extended the deadline for manual recounts of the ballot for the presidency and set a new deadline of November 26. But any hope - or fear - that the nine members of the US supreme court would cut through the tangle of cases in Florida and clear a path towards a final outcome of the disputed November 7 election disappeared yesterday with the publication of the ruling. \"As a general rule, this court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute,\" the ruling said. But, the higher court said, the Florida ruling may not have taken into account all the constitutional implications. The Washington judges remained \"unclear\" about the extent to which their Florida colleagues had taken account of article 2 of the constitution and of section 5 of the 1877 United States Code on the electoral college. In effect, the Florida court was told to think again. \"There is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the decision,\" the US supreme court found. \"This is sufficient reason for us to decline at this time to review the federal questions asserted to be present.\" \"Apparently what they said, as near as we can make out, is that they can't figure out what the Florida supreme court based its decision on, whether constitutional grounds or Florida state laws,\" Mr Bush's lawyer, Fred Bartlit, said. \"I think that if you read what the court said today, it's pretty clear that they're saying the Florida supreme court has got to tell us whether they were engaged in statutory interpretation or whether they were interpreting the Florida constitution,\" said Mr Gore's lawyer, David Boies. If the former were true, then the US supreme court would be likely to leave the Florida court's ruling alone, Mr Boies added.

It will be a formidable partnership, as the new company called Vivendi Universal will combine Vivendi's internet and telecoms interests, the Canal Plus pay-TV channel and Seagram's Universal Music and Universal Film operations. However, many observers doubt that Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier will be able to combine such disparate operations successfully. Richard Webb of Chase Fleming Asset Management, said: \"I am not convinced by the logic of it all. Vivendi cannot actually show where the added value can be found, and their share earnings have been diluted.\" A key to investor confidence in the deal is the Vizzavi mobile internet portal, a pan-European joint venture between Vivendi and Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company. The combined group's content has undoubted earning potential, but it needs a secure and diverse distribution platform to ensure a steady flow of revenues. The blockbuster \u00a391bn merger between AOL and Time Warner offers a more integrated base, with Warner's extensive US cable and AOL's massive subscriber numbers, though it has yet to secure approval from US watchdogs. Analysts have also complained about the lack of progress with the portal, which was launched with great fanfare in June but has been dogged by the threat of lawsuits and the slow roll-out of next generation mobile phone services. \"Vizzavi is the area with the most question marks in valuation. It could be worth from zero to $40bn (\u00a327.5bn), which is a huge gap,\" said one analyst. BT has filed a lawsuit against Vivendi, claiming that the portal breaks a shareholder agreement between the companies. The UK telecoms operator is a shareholder in SFR, the French mobile phone company which is controlled by Vivendi and uses Vizzavi. Sources close to Vivendi have complained that expectations are too high for a venture that only received EU approval in May and has yet to launch its combined mobile phone and personal computer services in the UK and France. According to user figures from Vodafone and Vivendi's internet and telecoms operations, Vizzavi has a customer base of 90m people, although the company will not release current user numbers. Despite fervent denials from Mr Messier, speculation continues to mount that Pierre Lescure, the head of Canal Plus, is unhappy with the management structure at Vivendi Universal and is set to resign.

They think it is unrealistic simply shunting them towards the nearest further education college and want to encourage learning in shopping centres, pubs and other community locations. \"We need to be radical and imaginative,\" Mr Blunkett said. \"Adults want to study at times and in places that are convenient for them, so we will ensure that their learning choices are rich and varied.\"",

      "body": "<p>The euro yesterday showed signs of turning the corner with the best five-day rally since it was introduced two years ago. </p> <p>Europe's single currency gained more than 5% against the dollar on the back of mounting worries about the health of the US economy, breaking through $0.89. This marked its strongest performance since the Group of Seven industrialised countries banded together to support it on September 22. </p> <p>The recent rises mean the G7 countries have made a profit of around $1bn between them since the intervention began, according to Nick Parsons, chief currency strategist at Commerzbank. </p> <p>Mr Parsons said the euro could now look forward to parity with the dollar in the first half of next year. </p> <p>\"It's been a day of reckoning on the foreign exchange market. It really does look as though the euro has turned a corner.\" </p> <p>Since the currency was first traded in January 1999 its value against the dollar has declined by around 25%. Investors have been attracted to the greenback by the relative strength of the US economy and a higher return on American assets. </p> <p>But now that the hi-tech bubble has burst and US growth is beginning to slow markedly, the dollar has suffered a reversal of fortune. </p> <p>Mr Parsons said that since its peak on March 10 the total market capitalisation of the Nasdaq - until last spring the symbol of US investors' rampant enthusiasm for technology stocks - had fallen by $4.1 trillion, or $15bn a day. </p> <p>Analysts say the dollar is exposed to a decline in hi-tech companies because they have been the driving force of US growth. </p> <p>In early trade yesterday, US stocks were mixed with the Nasdaq down more than 2.75% but the blue chip Dow Jones index up about 0.5%. </p> <p>The picture of a cooling economy was reinforced by a fall in the privately run Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a respected gauge of the US economy, which dipped 0.2% in October to 105.5. </p> <p>\"This series has been signaling, and continues to point toward, a cooling of still strong economic conditions,\" Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. </p> <p>Although the US labour market remains tight, falling share prices are beginning to de press consumer spending, the index suggested. </p> <p>\"This points not only to an economic slowdown, which has been going on, but a rising possibility of an economic downturn,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis. </p> <p>\"The probability of an economic recession is rising at a good pace, although a soft landing is still more likely today.\" </p> <p>To prevent the possibility of the slowdown turning into a recession, economists expect the US Federal Reserve, when it holds its next meeting on Tuesday week, to abandon its bias towards raising interest rates in favour of a neutral policy stance. </p> <p>However, the market is not anticipating a rate cut to bolster growth until March next year. </p> <p>The US central bank has held key short-term rates steady since May, following six rate rises after June 1999, but has repeatedly warned that it considers inflation a bigger economic risk than a sharp slowdown. </p> <p>In a separate report, the commerce department reported that sales of new US homes in October fell 2.6% to an annual rate of 928,000 units, compared to 953,000 in September.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The euro yesterday showed signs of turning the corner with the best five-day rally since it was introduced two years ago. Europe's single currency gained more than 5% against the dollar on the back of mounting worries about the health of the US economy, breaking through $0.89. This marked its strongest performance since the Group of Seven industrialised countries banded together to support it on September 22. The recent rises mean the G7 countries have made a profit of around $1bn between them since the intervention began, according to Nick Parsons, chief currency strategist at Commerzbank. Mr Parsons said the euro could now look forward to parity with the dollar in the first half of next year. \"It's been a day of reckoning on the foreign exchange market. It really does look as though the euro has turned a corner.\" Since the currency was first traded in January 1999 its value against the dollar has declined by around 25%. Investors have been attracted to the greenback by the relative strength of the US economy and a higher return on American assets. But now that the hi-tech bubble has burst and US growth is beginning to slow markedly, the dollar has suffered a reversal of fortune. Mr Parsons said that since its peak on March 10 the total market capitalisation of the Nasdaq - until last spring the symbol of US investors' rampant enthusiasm for technology stocks - had fallen by $4.1 trillion, or $15bn a day. Analysts say the dollar is exposed to a decline in hi-tech companies because they have been the driving force of US growth. In early trade yesterday, US stocks were mixed with the Nasdaq down more than 2.75% but the blue chip Dow Jones index up about 0.5%. The picture of a cooling economy was reinforced by a fall in the privately run Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a respected gauge of the US economy, which dipped 0.2% in October to 105.5. \"This series has been signaling, and continues to point toward, a cooling of still strong economic conditions,\" Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. Although the US labour market remains tight, falling share prices are beginning to de press consumer spending, the index suggested. \"This points not only to an economic slowdown, which has been going on, but a rising possibility of an economic downturn,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in Minneapolis. \"The probability of an economic recession is rising at a good pace, although a soft landing is still more likely today.\" To prevent the possibility of the slowdown turning into a recession, economists expect the US Federal Reserve, when it holds its next meeting on Tuesday week, to abandon its bias towards raising interest rates in favour of a neutral policy stance. However, the market is not anticipating a rate cut to bolster growth until March next year. The US central bank has held key short-term rates steady since May, following six rate rises after June 1999, but has repeatedly warned that it considers inflation a bigger economic risk than a sharp slowdown. In a separate report, the commerce department reported that sales of new US homes in October fell 2.6% to an annual rate of 928,000 units, compared to 953,000 in September.",

Drawing on unpublished DTI data, Mr Byers will cite polls showing that 94% of parents think fathers should have paternity leave and that a majority of new mothers say they are more likely to return to work if the husband has been paid leave. At present, just 38% of fathers are given specific paternity leave by their employers, a further 33% take annual leave and 31% take time off with the discretion of their manager. Mr Byers will suggest that the government's proposals are simply enlightened business practice as 24% of organisations with more than 250 employees already top up maternity pay. Figures from the Department of Social Security, also to be published on Thursday, will also show that only 7% of companies need to pay statutory maternity pay each year, and that 44% of these are entitled to recover 105% of what they pay out from the state. A separate Department of Employment survey will show that more than half of all employers think that everyone should be able to balance their work and and home life, provided this does not jeopardise the needs of business. Mr Byers will also cite surveys showing that half of employers will allow some movement from full-time to part-time work and three-quarters of those would make this available to women returning from maternity leave. The green paper, which has been the subject of extensive discussion, contends that many of the proposed new rights are not enforceable without improved child care provision.",

The proposal is part of a national crusade to boost basic skills to be launched today by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary. He believes radical solutions are needed because initiatives over recent years have failed to reduce illiteracy and innumeracy among adults. Last year a report by Sir Claus Moser said 7m adults had inadequate basic skills. The government believes these weaknesses are a threat to its vision of a \"skills economy\". A new cabinet committee set up to address the basic skills problem has set a target to cut the overall number of adults with weak literacy and numeracy by 750,000 by 2004. In today's Guardian education supplement Mr Blunkett outlines Skills for Life, a consultation paper for a comprehensive national strategy for tackling poor basic skills. The aim is \"to test out whether incentives to partici pate in basic education will help these individuals get and keep jobs,\" Mr Blunkett said. One way which could be explored would be to make payment of the benefit dependent on \"willingness to improve basic skills\", a departmental source said. This could mean testing claimants and making those identified with inadequate literacy and numeracy enrol for appropriate programmes, with a cut in benefit for those who refuse. Ministers believe many people's reluctance to return to study stems from dismal experiences first time around, which often accounted for their poor reading and writing skills. They think it is unrealistic simply shunting them towards the nearest further education college and want to encourage learning in shopping centres, pubs and other community locations. \"We need to be radical and imaginative,\" Mr Blunkett said. \"Adults want to study at times and in places that are convenient for them, so we will ensure that their learning choices are rich and varied.\"",

The concession would have the benefit of neutralising pro-European Conservatives ahead of polling day, and might even persuade the former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, to rejoin the shadow cabinet. The move has the tacit support of key figures in Business for Sterling, the most effective of the Eurosceptic lobbies. Lord Owen's New Europe campaign is also not opposed to a referendum in principle. The crucial gain for Mr Hague, as he slumps in the polls despite his seemingly popular stance against Europe, is that it would prevent Tony Blair from saying that only Labour is offering voters a choice if the cabinet decides to recommend British membership of the euro during the next parliament. Mr Hague is being told that the polls are so much in his favour on the single currency that he has nothing to lose and a lot to gain by offering voters a similar choice. Labour's private polling suggests that voters prefer having at least the option to join, rather than just Mr Hague's policy of keeping the pound for the next parliament - a line that fails to satisfy even his own hardliners. Late changes to the referendums act, passed last week, have given the proposed electoral commission - to be chaired by Sam Younger - the power to express an opinion on the fairness and intelligibility of the issue. Support for the idea of a referendum has come from the former shadow foreign secretary, John Maples, as well as the former education secretary, Gillian Shephard, and arch sceptics Sir Michael Spicer and Edward Leigh. Mr Hague, whose chief aides are Eurosceptics, may be reluctant to change course so late in the parliament, but he will be urged to on the basis of it being a vital tactical shift rather than a strategic retreat.

Greece wants the marbles, which it knows as the Parthenon sculptures, returned.</p> <p>The diplomatic dispute is the latest problem to mar the opening of Norman Foster's refurbishment of the Great Court following a row with English Heritage over the use of cheaper French instead of Portland stone to replace the demolished portico.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Greek embassy said: \"We are upset and astonished that the British Museum has decided to use the Duveen galleries for this event. We think it is really insensitive of the museum, coming straight after revelations about the holding of corporate dinners there and a buffet lunch during a conference on the Parthenon sculptures last year. The ambassador has decided not to attend either the opening and the supper, as it would be discourteous to the Queen to arrive but leave before the supper took place.\"</p> <p>A British Museum spokesman confirmed it had received \"a polite letter\" from the ambassador declining the invitation.</p> <p>Some 1,500 dignitaries and VIPs will attend the opening of the new Great Court, which is now enclosed by a stylish glass roof over the historic British Museum Reading Room. After the opening 600 guests will sit down to dinner in three rooms, including the Duveen galleries.</p> <p>The opening is being attended by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Margaret, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. The duke, who is a trustee of the museum, will be the main royal guest at the supper. Buckingham Palace said that the Queen, who is travelling by train to Newcastle upon Tyne the following day, would not stay for the supper. The palace has had to allow extra time for the rail journey because of speed restrictions.</p> <p>The ambassador took the unusual step of writing to Buckingham Palace to explain why he could not attend. The Greek government is said to have been concerned that the Queen should not think this a personal snub.</p> <p>It is said also to have taken the opportunity to explain the dispute over the marbles and its concern about the sculptures being used as a centrepiece for dinner parties.</p> <p>A spokesman for the palace said it could not comment on private correspondence with other governments.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Greek ambassador has snubbed the opening of the British Museum's new \u00a3100m Great Court by the Queen tomorrow because of a decision by the governors to hold a royal dinner in the galleries that house the Elgin marbles. Alexandros Sandis, the new ambassador, has declined an invitation to the opening and dinner, after pleading with the museum not to use the Duveen galleries which house the marbles for corporate entertaining. Greece wants the marbles, which it knows as the Parthenon sculptures, returned. The diplomatic dispute is the latest problem to mar the opening of Norman Foster's refurbishment of the Great Court following a row with English Heritage over the use of cheaper French instead of Portland stone to replace the demolished portico. A spokesman for the Greek embassy said: \"We are upset and astonished that the British Museum has decided to use the Duveen galleries for this event. We think it is really insensitive of the museum, coming straight after revelations about the holding of corporate dinners there and a buffet lunch during a conference on the Parthenon sculptures last year. The ambassador has decided not to attend either the opening and the supper, as it would be discourteous to the Queen to arrive but leave before the supper took place.\" A British Museum spokesman confirmed it had received \"a polite letter\" from the ambassador declining the invitation. Some 1,500 dignitaries and VIPs will attend the opening of the new Great Court, which is now enclosed by a stylish glass roof over the historic British Museum Reading Room. After the opening 600 guests will sit down to dinner in three rooms, including the Duveen galleries. The opening is being attended by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Margaret, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. The duke, who is a trustee of the museum, will be the main royal guest at the supper. Buckingham Palace said that the Queen, who is travelling by train to Newcastle upon Tyne the following day, would not stay for the supper. The palace has had to allow extra time for the rail journey because of speed restrictions. The ambassador took the unusual step of writing to Buckingham Palace to explain why he could not attend. The Greek government is said to have been concerned that the Queen should not think this a personal snub. It is said also to have taken the opportunity to explain the dispute over the marbles and its concern about the sculptures being used as a centrepiece for dinner parties. A spokesman for the palace said it could not comment on private correspondence with other governments.",

The Israeli military said it unleashed its tanks and combat helicopters after midnight to halt an attempt to storm Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish pilgrimage site and a flashpoint in the violence that has killed almost 300 people. But local people said Israeli gunners had opened fire hours earlier, hurling tank shells into shops, while an attack helicopter rocketed a seven-storey building overlooking the al-Aza refugee camp. The latest fighting brought the violence into the heart of Bethlehem, as well as two refugee camps straddling the town's main road. \"From 8pm and 2.30 in the morning, helicopters, machine guns, tanks - I could not believe it,\" said Ayed al-Kassi, whose grocery shop in Aza camp was hit by at least two rockets. \"My wife, my mother, my daughter and I hid for six hours under the stairs. The children were crying, and we prayed to God.\" For Bethlehem, where the authorities have already cancelled official Christmas celebrations, the attack was another blow to hopes for peace. \"They have killed everything, there will be no Christmas this year in Bethlehem,\" said Jiries Freij, the deputy governor of Bethlehem. \"It is going to be very, very sad. The whole world now should understand that if they keep silent, this is going to go on and on, and we will only be left with war.\" After a relatively quiet weekend, the first signs of trouble came with a confrontation between Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the village of Husan, near Bethlehem. Palestinians say the clashes began when shots were fired from a white pick-up truck at the village mosque, where worshippers were gathering for evening prayers. The Israeli army said its soldiers moved in when villagers stoned a car driven by a Jewish woman travelling to the settlement. Two dozen people were injured by Israeli fire, two seriously. \"This is a deliberate and planned escalation,\" the Palestinian authority said in a statement. \"We appeal to the whole world to secure protection for our people from attacks by settlers and soldiers, and we hold the Israeli government fully responsible for this ugly crime in Husan.\"",

      "body": "<p>Forget a satisfying lunch at the Savoy. The real way to a City analyst's heart is to put an exotic stamp on his passport. </p> <p>Take mining outfit <strong>Billiton</strong>. Yesterday its stock topped the blue chip leaderboard - up 14.5p to 242.5p - after the City's top mining brains returned from a five day \"research trip\" to its operations in Chile and Peru. </p> <p>Officially the trip was a first and at least for some time the last chance for analysts to see the copper assets of Rio Algom, the international mining group Billiton acquired earlier this year for $1.2bn (\u00a3826m). Billiton goes into its two month silent period ahead of interim figures in February next week. </p> <p>However, traders suggested there might have been a hidden subtext - to convince the doubters that its strategy of increasing its exposure to copper is a good idea. </p> <p>By all accounts the trip, which started last Monday, got off to a good start. There were no shortage of analysts willing to go, something that might have been helped by Billiton's generous offer to pay the \u00a34,000 air fare. It seems the offer was taken up by one or two City analysts who have exceeded their travel budgets. </p> <p>If that offer was generous so too was the feedback. While some analysts, namely those at Deutsche Bank, still think Billiton still paid too much for Rio Algom, all were in agreement about the quality of the assets and management. The analysts visited two sites, which represented more than half the total value of Algom. One was said to be operating well and the other on track to enter operation ahead of schedule. </p> <p>While the Billiton tale might have provided an interesting diversion on an otherwise drab Monday, there was no doubting the hot topic of debate in City dealing rooms - the future of <strong> Abbey National </strong>, up 41.5p to \u00a311.45. </p> <p>Various theories were advanced through the session. One that gained support early in the day was that <strong> Lloyds TSB</strong>, down 9p 665p, would wait until Abbey National and <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong>, up 16p at 696p, announced details of a nil premium merger before launching a near \u00a313 a share offer. </p> <p>But late in the day this tale had been replaced by a more straight forward one - a bid for Abbey in the morning from Lloyds. Once again the magical figure of \u00a313 was being mentioned. But the sceptics noted the only thing this story had in its favour was the heavy - 14m - turnover in Abbey shares. </p> <p>Such excitement was in marked contrast to events in the wider market. The FTSE 100 index closed down 11.7 points at 6,158.7, as buyers stayed and sellers stayed on the sidelines waiting for fresh direction from Nasdaq. </p> <p>When debutant <strong> Bradford &amp; Bingley</strong> and market heavyweight <strong> Vodafone</strong> were stripped out of the equation, market turnover just topped 1bn shares. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 index eased 17.95 points to 2,576.78 and the FTSE Mid 250 slipped 25.5 points to 6,437.6. </p> <p><strong>Shire Pharmaceuticals</strong> provided some colour to the session with a rise 36p to \u00a311.10. Merrill Lynch reckons recent weakness in its share price on fears about generic competition for Adderall, its top selling drug for attention deficit disorder, has been overdone. Merrill's sizeable salesforce was yesterday telling its clients the recent weakness is an excellent buying opportunity. </p> <p>Going the other way was <strong>Granada Media</strong>, off 11p at 388p after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut the stock from \"buy\" to \"market perform\". Despite last weeks decent figures, Deutsche analyst Paul Reynolds does not think Granada is in any position to achieve its revenue targets and has downgraded his current year profits forecast - 33% - accordingly. </p> <p>In the mid cap market, favourable movements in the currency markets and a UBS Warburg upgrade helped steel maker <strong>Corus</strong> advance 7.75p to 69.75p, while <strong> Infobank </strong> rose 12.5p to 325p ahead of institutional presentations today. </p> <p><strong>Aberdeen Asset Managers</strong> rose 11.5p to 550p. Word has it that today's full-year figures will be much better than anticipated.</p>",

The analysts visited two sites, which represented more than half the total value of Algom. One was said to be operating well and the other on track to enter operation ahead of schedule. While the Billiton tale might have provided an interesting diversion on an otherwise drab Monday, there was no doubting the hot topic of debate in City dealing rooms - the future of Abbey National , up 41.5p to \u00a311.45. Various theories were advanced through the session. One that gained support early in the day was that Lloyds TSB, down 9p 665p, would wait until Abbey National and Bank of Scotland, up 16p at 696p, announced details of a nil premium merger before launching a near \u00a313 a share offer. But late in the day this tale had been replaced by a more straight forward one - a bid for Abbey in the morning from Lloyds. Once again the magical figure of \u00a313 was being mentioned. But the sceptics noted the only thing this story had in its favour was the heavy - 14m - turnover in Abbey shares. Such excitement was in marked contrast to events in the wider market. The FTSE 100 index closed down 11.7 points at 6,158.7, as buyers stayed and sellers stayed on the sidelines waiting for fresh direction from Nasdaq. When debutant Bradford &amp; Bingley and market heavyweight Vodafone were stripped out of the equation, market turnover just topped 1bn shares. Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 index eased 17.95 points to 2,576.78 and the FTSE Mid 250 slipped 25.5 points to 6,437.6. Shire Pharmaceuticals provided some colour to the session with a rise 36p to \u00a311.10. Merrill Lynch reckons recent weakness in its share price on fears about generic competition for Adderall, its top selling drug for attention deficit disorder, has been overdone. Merrill's sizeable salesforce was yesterday telling its clients the recent weakness is an excellent buying opportunity. Going the other way was Granada Media, off 11p at 388p after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut the stock from \"buy\" to \"market perform\". Despite last weeks decent figures, Deutsche analyst Paul Reynolds does not think Granada is in any position to achieve its revenue targets and has downgraded his current year profits forecast - 33% - accordingly. In the mid cap market, favourable movements in the currency markets and a UBS Warburg upgrade helped steel maker Corus advance 7.75p to 69.75p, while Infobank rose 12.5p to 325p ahead of institutional presentations today. Aberdeen Asset Managers rose 11.5p to 550p. Word has it that today's full-year figures will be much better than anticipated.",

Among those affected by the plummeting EM.TV share price is Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, part of Deutsche Bank asset management, which sold a stake in SLEC earlier this year to EM.TV in exchange for EM.TV shares. Last night Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the fall in value of the EM.TV holding, which was given a price tag of around $450m when the deal was done, against the $275m Morgan Grenfell Private Equity paid for the SLEC holding. Deutsche Bank also refused to comment on exactly how many shares Morgan Grenfell Private Equity had acquired or the price per share it paid. One report suggests, however, that it could be sitting on paper losses of as much as $270m. Yesterday, alongside its nine-month figures, EM.TV detailed the financial performance of both the Jim Henson Company - the Muppet business which it bought at the beginning of April - and Formula One.

With three days to go before the Nice summit, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, insisted last night he was opposed to arrangements that might duplicate the alliance's work. The disagreement over the French idea on defence adds another contentious item to the agenda at the summit - billed as the most important since Maastricht - which must agree vital reforms in order to allow the EU to accept new members. Three big issues - reweighting the votes of member states, the future size of the European commission and majority voting - appear deadlocked, according to diplomats. But Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, expressed confidence that negotiations would end in success. \"It looks very difficult, but we will reach an agreement because every country wants to get that agreement,\" he said.

His comments came as the US defence secretary, William Cohen, warned that Nato and US security ties with Europe will be eroded if the EU insists on separate operational planning for the European force. Speaking on the eve of a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Brussels, Mr Cohen said the EU force should not have a separate planning operation but should rely on Nato's expertise in that field. He stressed that Washington supported the EU's move to shore up its own defences with the force, which is to be ready in 2003. But he added: \"If they try to set up a separate operational planning capability - separate and distinct from that of Nato itself - then that is going to weaken the ties between the US and Nato and Nato and the EU.\" There was one victory for the summiteers yesterday when foreign ministers managed to settle a potentially damaging row with Turkey, the 13th and most difficult of the candidates queueing up to join an enlarged EU.

The timing is bad from a financial point of view because power prices are now high in California and the western US. Shops feel seasonal chill The Christmas shopping season got off to a slow start last month, with sales of top high street stores rising just 2% from one year ago, according to the British Retail Consortium's monthly survey published today. \"Disruption to transport and rain throughout November appears to have dampened people's enthusiasm for shopping,\" said Bill Moyes, director general of the BRC. Bridget Rosewell, chief economic adviser to the BRC, said shoppers could well be waiting for discounts before doing their Christmas shopping.",

What matters is how such votes get translated into the seats held by the respective parties in the House of Commons. Ultimately it is the tally of constituencies won that decides the outcome of a general election; but, typically, little attention is given to this fact when polls are reported. That may be because the business of translating votes cast for parties into seats held in the Commons is thought to be very difficult.</p> <p>It is not as complicated as some people think. In the 1950s, when Labour and the Tories dominated the Commons, the device for translating vote shares into seat shares was known as the \"cube rule\". This formula stated that the ratio of Tory to Labour seats in the Commons was the same not as the straightforward ratio of one party's vote to the other's but as the ratio between the cube of the Tory vote-share and the cube of the Labour vote-share.</p> <p>The rule is not as involved as it may at first appear. Take the 1955 general election, when Anthony Eden's Tories faced a Labour party led by an ageing Clement Attlee. The Tories won 49.7% of votes cast for MPs and Labour 46.4%. If we cube these percentages we get a figure of 122,763 for the Tories and 99,897 for Labour. That makes the Tory share just over 55% of the combined total. So their predicted share of seats in the Commons should also be 55%. Thus in 1955 the cube rule predicted 347 Tory seats and 283 Labour seats. The seats actually won by the parties were 344 for the Tories and 295 for Labour. The rule was not completely accurate but it did come pretty close.</p> <p>Two-party rule was broken when the Liberals (as they then were) and the Scottish and Welsh nationalists started to win seats, and by the 1970s the cube rule had become quite inaccurate. The February 1974 election called by Ted Heath was a turning point. The Liberals took 19% - a three-horse race. If we apply the cube rule to the 1997 general election, it predicts 485 Labour seats, when they actually won 418. So the rule is not very accurate in the context of multi-party politics.</p> <p>But there are alternative models for predicting how Commons seats fall out. One method is to give each party a baseline number of seats and then add extra seats for every additional percent of the vote won by that party while subtracting seats for the share of the vote won by its main rival. If we retrospectively apply this model to the 1997 election, it performs quite well, giving a result only five seats out for Labour and nine out for the Tories.</p> <p>The model does less well with the Liberal Democrats, forecasting 33 seats for them when they actually won 46 seats. The problem with calculating Liberal Democrat seats is that they are rivals to the Tories in many more seats than they are in close competition with Labour, so the scale of Tory support has a big influence on their success. Another factor is that the Liberal Democrat seat tally is influenced by the effectiveness of their local constituency campaigns. While targeted campaigns are important for Labour, they are really important for the Liberal Democrats and the model does not take this into account.</p> <p>September's Gallup poll - the survey was conducted just after the petrol crisis - said 44% intended to vote Labour, 35% Tory and 17% for the Liberal Democrats. If we apply the forecasting model to these figures it predicts 377 seats for labour, 219 for the Tories and 26 for the Liberal Democrat. However, the same Gallup poll - testing the idea that Labour supporters might be less likely to turn out and vote than supporters of the other parties - asked respondents to indicate the strength of their intention to vote in the next general election. Respondents who said they were very likely to vote made up 72% of the sample, which is fairly close to the actual turnout in the last general election. We get a more accurate picture of actual voting behaviour by concentrating on this group.</p> <p>The voting intentions of this group were 42% for Labour, 36% for the Tories and 17% for the Liberal Democrats. So the bias caused by lower turnouts among Labour supporters appears to be worth about 2%. Translated into seats gained by the parties, this would give Labour 358, the Tories 240 and the Liberal Democrats 24. The last figure is a bit of a problem: as before, the Liberal Democrat prediction is likely to be less accurate than for the other two parties. Other research shows that if Liberal Democrat party members can campaign as effectively at the local level as they did in 1997, they could do significantly better than this figure suggests.</p> <p>So what happens when we apply this reasoning to the latest evidence of people's voting intentions? The November MORI poll published recently in the Times gave Labour 48%, the Tories 33% and the Liberal Democrats 13%. If we factor in a 2% adjustment to the Labour and Tory shares to reflect differences in turnout, then the model predicts 397 seats for Labour, 199 Tory and 26 Liberal Democrats - Labour's winning margin is 172. Labour has clearly bounced back from the petrol crisis.</p> <p>A necessary caveat is that things may be upset again. But if not, the Tories look set to take a real beating at the next election, enough to make William Hague vulnerable as their leader. You might conclude that Michael Portillo picked a bad time to express reluctance to stand for the Tory leadership, since it is looking increasingly likely that the job will become vacant when votes are counted after the next election.</p> <p>Paul Whiteley is professor of politics at the University of Sheffield.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.whiteley@sheffield.ac.uk\">P.Whiteley@sheffield.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Admirers of Dame Margot Fonteyn, the greatest British dancer of the 20th century, are fighting a behind the scenes campaign to stop treasured relics of her career vanishing abroad into private collections.</p> <p>One is understood to have written to the Queen, pleading for support in raising funds to buy the prima ballerina assoluta's costumes and letters for the nation when they come up for auction at Christie's in London next Tuesday.</p> <p>Their spokesman, the distinguished ballet director Sir Peter Wright, said last night: \"It breaks my heart to think that these things may be hidden away in some collection in the US or south America.</p> <p>\"The prospect is horrifying. It is a tragedy that we seem to have lost our national pride. We as a nation will be the poorer.\"</p> <p>The collection of 150 items includes the tutu for the Sleeping Beauty in the production which brought Fonteyn to sudden and enduring international fame in 1946. There are also costumes in which she danced alongside Rudolf Nureyev in Swan Lake, as well as her lifelong correspondence with her mentor, Ninette de Valois. Fonteyn died in 1991 after a career spanning more than 40 years.</p> <p>The collection is understood to have been put on the mar ket by the family of her late brother, Felix. It is expected to raise well over \u00a3100,000 - though ballet dresses and headdresses are priced at relatively low figures, from \u00a3600 to \u00a35,000.</p> <p>Sir Peter, 74, director laureate of Birmingham (formerly Sadler's Wells) Royal Ballet, danced with Fonteyn in the late 1940s and directed her in many productions until the early 1980s. He said one leading campaigner had delivered a letter to Buckingham Palace appealing for help from the Queen, who has been patron to the Royal Ballet.</p> <p>Sir Peter said: \"There is anguish about this in the ballet world. It is a tragedy that we seem to be losing the legacy of the greatest and most wonderful stars like Fonteyn, Frederick Ashton, and Nureyev. This extensive collection seems to be being auctioned off in a hurry. But, since there are no funds, it is understandable the family wishes to sell it.\"</p> <p>Both the National Art Collections Fund and the Royal Opera House were unable to help. \"I hope many people with influence - and hopefully money - will go and buy some of these things and donate them to the Royal Opera House, where they can be collated and displayed.\"</p> <p>Sir Peter added that Dame Ninette, aged 102, was not well enough to be told of the sale: \"I know it would break her heart.\"</p> <p>The costume from Fonteyn's 1946 Sleeping Beauty recalled for him the \"night of nights\" when he saw it as a young dancer. \"It was exquisitely danced, with the greatest interpretative artistry as she moved from the innocence of a young girl into becoming a young woman.

      "bodyText": "Admirers of Dame Margot Fonteyn, the greatest British dancer of the 20th century, are fighting a behind the scenes campaign to stop treasured relics of her career vanishing abroad into private collections. One is understood to have written to the Queen, pleading for support in raising funds to buy the prima ballerina assoluta's costumes and letters for the nation when they come up for auction at Christie's in London next Tuesday. Their spokesman, the distinguished ballet director Sir Peter Wright, said last night: \"It breaks my heart to think that these things may be hidden away in some collection in the US or south America. \"The prospect is horrifying. It is a tragedy that we seem to have lost our national pride. We as a nation will be the poorer.\" The collection of 150 items includes the tutu for the Sleeping Beauty in the production which brought Fonteyn to sudden and enduring international fame in 1946. There are also costumes in which she danced alongside Rudolf Nureyev in Swan Lake, as well as her lifelong correspondence with her mentor, Ninette de Valois. Fonteyn died in 1991 after a career spanning more than 40 years. The collection is understood to have been put on the mar ket by the family of her late brother, Felix. It is expected to raise well over \u00a3100,000 - though ballet dresses and headdresses are priced at relatively low figures, from \u00a3600 to \u00a35,000. Sir Peter, 74, director laureate of Birmingham (formerly Sadler's Wells) Royal Ballet, danced with Fonteyn in the late 1940s and directed her in many productions until the early 1980s. He said one leading campaigner had delivered a letter to Buckingham Palace appealing for help from the Queen, who has been patron to the Royal Ballet. Sir Peter said: \"There is anguish about this in the ballet world. It is a tragedy that we seem to be losing the legacy of the greatest and most wonderful stars like Fonteyn, Frederick Ashton, and Nureyev. This extensive collection seems to be being auctioned off in a hurry. But, since there are no funds, it is understandable the family wishes to sell it.\" Both the National Art Collections Fund and the Royal Opera House were unable to help. \"I hope many people with influence - and hopefully money - will go and buy some of these things and donate them to the Royal Opera House, where they can be collated and displayed.\" Sir Peter added that Dame Ninette, aged 102, was not well enough to be told of the sale: \"I know it would break her heart.\" The costume from Fonteyn's 1946 Sleeping Beauty recalled for him the \"night of nights\" when he saw it as a young dancer. \"It was exquisitely danced, with the greatest interpretative artistry as she moved from the innocence of a young girl into becoming a young woman. It was thrilling. She was unmatched as an interpreter of a role.\" In their work together, \"she was quite a hard taskmaster. She pushed me into getting the best she possibly could. She was the most amazing and selfless artist I have ever seen.\" After speaking to the Fonteyn family last night, Christie's said: \"The vendors believe that offering this collection at auction is the most appropriate way of giving all of Fonteyn's many fans, as well as other interested parties, an opportunity to acquire individual items on the open market.\" \u0095 Born Margaret Hookham in Reigate, Surrey on May 18 1919.

      "bodyText": "The controversial practice of feeding ground animal remains to pigs and poultry is to be outlawed across the European Union from January as part of a continent-wide effort to stamp out a rising wave of consumer panic over mad cow disease. In a move which brings the rest of Europe more into line with anti-BSE measures already taken in Britain, EU agriculture ministers yesterday agreed to ban the use of meat and bonemeal from animal feed, initially for six months only, from January 1. Britain has outlawed the practice since 1996 but other countries have continued to feed meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry believing it to be safe. Late last night ministers were poised to adopt Europe's most drastic package of anti-BSE measures to date, including the effective banning of 7m older cattle from all food products from the same date. Under the scheme cattle carcasses more than 30 months old which have not been tested for BSE will not be allowed to enter the food chain. Countries such as Sweden and Finland - which are still able to boast BSE-free cattle herds - were, however, showing some signs of opposition to the deal, mainly because of the high costs involved. It could cost \u00a33.4bn to implement. But most countries were eager to clinch an agreement to avoid the issue spilling over into the crunch EU summit in Nice later this week. Momentum for action over BSE has been building in recent weeks after the first cases of mad cow disease were discovered in Germany and Spain. A rise in BSE incidence in France has also piled on the pressure and sales of beef have plunged around Europe as consumers have rushed to switch to chicken and pork. Although there is scant scientific evidence to prove that feeding meat and bonemeal to pigs and poultry poses a risk to human health, the European commission suspects that many European farmers are illegally giving the feed to cattle, a practice known to be dangerous. Spokeswoman Beate Gminder said: \"We have serious doubts about whether the separation of feed is being done properly. The commission is very satisfied that this went through because it will give us a period of time to review our controls.\" By taking meat-based feed out of the foodchain altogether the EU aims to choke off supplies so that unscrupu lous farmers are not tempted to give the feed to their cows. Germany and Finland opposed the ban. Germany thought the measures were not strict enough while Finland considered it was being unfairly forced to act in the light of the fact that its herds are supposedly BSE-free. The entire package was supported by Nick Brown, Britain's agriculture minister, who argued that an EU-wide approach to the problem was the only option. He is keen to discourage individual member states from taking unilateral action because he believes a continent-wide response to the disease increases Britain's chances of getting France to lift its own illegal ban on British beef. \"I think the French were wrong on their ban against British beef... they were wrong on science and they are wrong in law,\" Mr Brown told BBC radio. \"For the rest of the EU to replicate that would be a mistake. There aren't national solutions to this.

The plane was grounded at Casablanca for three days while our government, as a member of the UN 661 sanctions committee, kept demanding more details.

The fact that her resignation coincided with the end of a brief stint filling in until columnist Carol Sarler arrived, and that she could not have known of Mr Desmond's takeover when she finished her last piece and that she had no job to resign from or further work for the Express not to do, is not the point.</p> <p>\u0095 Syd and Norma Davis write from Somerset to report committing a faux pas in the Weston-super-Mare Tesco when, after unloading their stuff, they tried to push the trolley through the checkout corridor.

      "bodyText": "Geoffrey Crawford, the Queen's press secretary, confirmed yesterday that he is leaving Buckingham Palace to become a public relations executive in his native Australia. Mr Crawford, an urbane and genial former diplomat, helped to steer the Queen through the crisis after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997 and was at her side on her recent official visit to Italy. His decision comes only 18 months before the royal golden jubilee, but suggestions in the Sunday Times that the Queen was annoyed by his leaving - rumoured for some time - were dismissed last night as utter rubbish by a palace spokesman. In a statement the palace said: \"The Queen is saddened by Mr Crawford's departure but entirely understands the reasons for it.\" Mr Crawford, 50, was seconded to become an assistant press secretary to the Queen in 1988 and was made press secretary to the Princess of Wales in 1993, at the time of her separation from the Prince of Wales. He resigned from that post after the princess failed to tell him in advance about her notorious Panorama interview in 1995 in which she admitted adultery. He was taken up by the palace again to become first deputy press secretary and then, from early 1997, press secretary to the Queen in succession to Charles Anson, another former diplomat who went into corporate public relations. Mr Crawford has also represented the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, Princess Margaret and Princess Alexandra during his period at the palace. One of his most difficult mo ments came when he was identified as the official source who rubbished the Duchess of York in an off-the-record briefing to the BBC in 1992. Mr Crawford's deputy, Penny Russell-Smith, 44, a former government press officer who has worked at the palace for seven years, is to succeed him. Her promotion means that the Queen and Prince Charles will each have a woman and former civil servant as their chief spokesperson.

We do not aim to get rich from Waterstone's, but have supplied books when they order from us (Bookshop discounts 'threat to publishing', December 2). The first invoice went unpaid for over a year, despite reminders and phone calls. We sued through the small claims court and they paid immediately plus costs.</p> <p>Our second order is now coming up to 12 months overdue and we are about to sue again. Waterstone's sponsor the Essex Book Awards for which one of our books was short-listed. We didn't win but enjoyed a good awards ceremony: especially the bit where the Waterstone's representative had to tell the prize-winner he had been unable to get a cheque to pay the \u00a3200 prize. It seems Waterstone's want 100% not just 50% from really small publishers.<br> <b>David Corke</b><br> Lopinga Books <a href=\"mailto:Lopinga@aol.com\">Lopinga@aol.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 The news that 635 publishers are demanding an inquiry into Waterstone's request for improved terms may cause amusement among booksellers, but the publishers concerned should be ashamed. The UK publishing industry is chronically resentful of being required to function by the rules of the market. Booksellers, whom nobody proposes to subsidise, cannot afford such scruples.</p> <p>The real threat to publishing comes from publishers themselves. There are too many of them. Some are so amateurish in the conduct of their business, that they appear to have contempt for everyone else in the supply chain, not excepting the customer. Yet in their naked greed they persist in throwing new titles of dubious quality at an oversaturated market like mud at a wall.</p> <p>As a former Waterstone's bookseller, I remember struggling to extract single copies of a book from publishers who routinely lost or misdirected orders, and were unable to process an order within 28 days. If the book arrived, it would often be found to bear a \"single copy surcharge\", which obliterated the bookseller's margin.</p> <p>David Kneale's real crime lies in exposing to public scrutiny one of publishing's dirty secrets: that incompetent publishers have long relied on the buffer of unrealistically large subscription orders and a slow and complex returns procedure to disguise low sales.

      "bodyText": "Small publishers do not come much smaller than us (four local-interest titles, one-man company). We do not aim to get rich from Waterstone's, but have supplied books when they order from us (Bookshop discounts 'threat to publishing', December 2). The first invoice went unpaid for over a year, despite reminders and phone calls. We sued through the small claims court and they paid immediately plus costs. Our second order is now coming up to 12 months overdue and we are about to sue again. Waterstone's sponsor the Essex Book Awards for which one of our books was short-listed. We didn't win but enjoyed a good awards ceremony: especially the bit where the Waterstone's representative had to tell the prize-winner he had been unable to get a cheque to pay the \u00a3200 prize. It seems Waterstone's want 100% not just 50% from really small publishers. David Corke Lopinga Books Lopinga@aol.com \u0095 The news that 635 publishers are demanding an inquiry into Waterstone's request for improved terms may cause amusement among booksellers, but the publishers concerned should be ashamed. The UK publishing industry is chronically resentful of being required to function by the rules of the market. Booksellers, whom nobody proposes to subsidise, cannot afford such scruples. The real threat to publishing comes from publishers themselves. There are too many of them. Some are so amateurish in the conduct of their business, that they appear to have contempt for everyone else in the supply chain, not excepting the customer. Yet in their naked greed they persist in throwing new titles of dubious quality at an oversaturated market like mud at a wall. As a former Waterstone's bookseller, I remember struggling to extract single copies of a book from publishers who routinely lost or misdirected orders, and were unable to process an order within 28 days. If the book arrived, it would often be found to bear a \"single copy surcharge\", which obliterated the bookseller's margin. David Kneale's real crime lies in exposing to public scrutiny one of publishing's dirty secrets: that incompetent publishers have long relied on the buffer of unrealistically large subscription orders and a slow and complex returns procedure to disguise low sales. No wonder the industry objected when BookTrack began to release accurate weekly sales figures to the media. Compared with publishing, bookselling is a model of transparency.

      "body": "<p>Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper,\" wrote the journalist Charles MacKay in his book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. \"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\" </p> <p>The year was 1841, and the mass hysterias MacKay had in mind were the tulip-buying mania of 17th-century Antwerp and the frenzied buying of shares in the South Sea Company in 18th-century London. But, sipping a latte in one of Silicon Valley's numerous identikit coffee shops in recent years, listening to the talk of business plans drawn up and deals done, of millions of dollars poured into businesses with no particular plans to turn a profit any time soon, he might have made similar observations. And we may be about to recover our senses sooner than we thought. </p> <p>According to a new survey, once-enthusiastic internet users are logging off in droves: 28 million people in the United States, and perhaps two million in the UK, now fall into the category of \"former internet users\". Even worse, it is teenagers - the very age group on whom the future of the medium supposedly depends - who are disconnecting in the greatest numbers. \"They were energised by what you can do on the net,\" said Professor Steve Woolgar of the Virtual Society? research programme, which carried out the survey with sponsorship from the Economic and Social Research Council, \"but they have been through all that and realised there is more to life in the real world.\" </p> <p>If Woolgar is to be believed, we really do want books with spines that crack; movies in popcorn-strewn cinemas; sex with real people. Add to that the recent string of downbeat dispatches from cyberspace - from the collapse of Boo.com and Clickmango to the commercial failure of Stephen King's online novel The Plant to the plunge in tech shares on the world's stock markets - and pessimistic minds begin to see a pattern emerging. </p> <p>\"There's a genuine belief that this technology is transformative for the better,\" says Sally Wyatt, another researcher on the Virtual Society? project, \"but the evidence is really pretty slim. History is littered with technologies which promised radical change and it didn't happen.\" </p> <p>The internet boom is not tulipomania: it has already wrought far too much social change for that. But it might, Wyatt speculates, end up looking in hindsight a lot like CB radio: initially a cult among specialists; a sudden, skyrocketing surge in popularity, and then, well . . . not much, really. Mentioning one's email address at the better sort of party, it seems, might one day be as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as loudly informing the assembled gathering of one's CB call sign. </p> <p>Like any technological revolution - farming or factories, trains or televisions - the internet has long attracted its fair share of evangelists, and at first we believed them. \"The first wave of hype was: everything is going virtual,\" says the US media critic and author Jon Katz. \"Everything - all movies, all books - would go online. It was a classic moral panic, a hysteria.\" But then, in 1995, two Americans, James Katz and Philip Aspden, noticed something strange. The two academics had been preparing a survey on internet use. They only included the category of \"former internet user\" for conceptual clarity: logically, such a being could exist, but they didn't expect that any actually would. And so they were taken aback when their survey revealed that 8% of their sample had peered into the infinite depths of cyberspace - and decided they didn't like what they saw. </p> <p>What is it that these early rejecters - and the many more identified in the Virtual Society? survey - didn't like? One seductive argument is the ubiquitous claim that the internet just isn't human, that it isn't part of Woolgar's \"real world\" - that we simply won't be \"fooled\" by a virtual, and therefore somehow inferior, version of life. But the explanations often turn out to be rather different. </p> <p>For one thing, researchers report, it's expensive: there are pieces of hardware to buy, internet service providers to subscribe to, telephone bills to pay - and then more, better hardware to buy, and so on. (Most free providers still can't match the level of service of the paid-for ones, and unmetered access, finally on the horizon, still costs money.) More crucially, though, the promise that it would simplify our lives didn't seem anywhere close to being realised. The Virtual Society? researchers confirmed most office workers' suspicions with their finding that email is adding to, not solving, the problem of information overload. We fret over writing them, because we know they can be stored and used against us, and then we hold meetings to discuss those emails. \"Email has increased, rather than reduced, the number of face-to-face meetings,\" write Dr Steven Brown and Dr Geoff Lightfoot in the report, \"since meetings are now held to resolve disputes arising from electronic communication.\" </p> <p>And above all the internet is simply too slow. Advances in technology had prompted vast increases in the amount and speed of information that could be transmitted on the net - but the volume of information has grown even faster: elaborate web pages, data-heavy movies and music. To disinter the oldest of internet metaphors, we kept adding new lanes to the information superhighway and - just as on the M25 - new cars arrived from nowhere. </p> <p>\"We're going through a healthy process of discovering that the internet is good for some things and bad for others,\" says Jon Katz. \"There was too much money being thrown at too many companies for too many dubious reasons.\" But he doesn't share the doom-mongers' view that this means the cyber-revolution is drawing to a close. \"People are confusing this new air of reality with the idea that the internet is over.\" </p> <p>But something is changing. Deep beneath the highways and the seabeds of the industrialised world, telecommunications companies are laying thousands of miles of fibre-optic cables that will carry communications on the internet at the speed of light - and herald, so the enthusiasts say, an era that will reduce the net of the 1990s to a similar status to that held today by the ZX Spectrum and Betamax video recorder. </p> <p>\"We are now entering a new era,\" writes the breathless George Gilder, the leading prophet of this \"bandwidth revolution\", in his new book Telecosm. \"A new form of PC will be dominant. It may not do Windows, but it will do doors. Tetherlessly transcending most of the limitations of the current PC era, the most com mon PC will be a digital cellular phone. And, oh yes, it will unlock your front door or car door, open your garage door, or even play Jim Morrison songs.\" </p> <p>The instant, infinite internet - whose working title, among the techies currently beavering away on its more arcane elements, is the \"evernet\" - will eliminate many of the internet's biggest turn-offs at a stroke, rendering once-grainy movies at cinema quality and music to rival the sounds of a concert hall. Meanwhile, at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a new invention, \"electronic paper\", promises soon to remove the discomfort of reading books on a computer monitor. </p> <p>\"It's like Evel Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon,\" says Mike Butcher, news editor of the Industry Standard Europe, the new economy bible, demonstrating a panache for metaphor typical of those who struggle to communicate these changes to a lay audience that is enthusiastic but out of its depth. \"There is a chasm between internet access now and access whenever you want it, wherever you want it: via your TV, your mobile phone. Right now, we're mid-jump.\" </p> <p>You have to be young to understand this, Jon Katz argues - and he means young . \"If you're not 13, it's almost impossible to keep up with the culture. The internet empowers and liberates young people by giving them access to so much information that it creates an enormous chasm between the young and the old,\" he says. \"But just as it was a mistake to assume that the internet was ever going to change everything, it's a bigger mistake to conclude that it is ever going to go away.\" </p> <p>In any case, \"using the internet\" is becoming an ever vaguer concept. Not only are we presented with the prospect of net connections in our fridges and earrings; we are already, even the greatest Luddites among us, using the internet at one remove when we do business with any of the thousands of major companies that deal with each other via electronic markets or organise their distribution and payments systems over the web. At least some of the teenagers who are logging off in their hordes are turning to text messaging on their mobile phones - a technology that doesn't currently use the internet but will soon, as fully internet-connected mobile phones come to market. </p> <p>And herein lies another way of reading the Virtual Society? study's findings: more of us may no longer think of ourselves as using the internet, but only because it has permeated our lives so deeply that we can no longer see the distinction between using it and not using it. It may be only when we no longer think of ourselves as internet users that the virtual age will truly have arrived.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked almost their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper,\" wrote the journalist Charles MacKay in his book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. \"Men, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\" The year was 1841, and the mass hysterias MacKay had in mind were the tulip-buying mania of 17th-century Antwerp and the frenzied buying of shares in the South Sea Company in 18th-century London. But, sipping a latte in one of Silicon Valley's numerous identikit coffee shops in recent years, listening to the talk of business plans drawn up and deals done, of millions of dollars poured into businesses with no particular plans to turn a profit any time soon, he might have made similar observations. And we may be about to recover our senses sooner than we thought. According to a new survey, once-enthusiastic internet users are logging off in droves: 28 million people in the United States, and perhaps two million in the UK, now fall into the category of \"former internet users\". Even worse, it is teenagers - the very age group on whom the future of the medium supposedly depends - who are disconnecting in the greatest numbers. \"They were energised by what you can do on the net,\" said Professor Steve Woolgar of the Virtual Society? research programme, which carried out the survey with sponsorship from the Economic and Social Research Council, \"but they have been through all that and realised there is more to life in the real world.\" If Woolgar is to be believed, we really do want books with spines that crack; movies in popcorn-strewn cinemas; sex with real people. Add to that the recent string of downbeat dispatches from cyberspace - from the collapse of Boo.com and Clickmango to the commercial failure of Stephen King's online novel The Plant to the plunge in tech shares on the world's stock markets - and pessimistic minds begin to see a pattern emerging. \"There's a genuine belief that this technology is transformative for the better,\" says Sally Wyatt, another researcher on the Virtual Society? project, \"but the evidence is really pretty slim. History is littered with technologies which promised radical change and it didn't happen.\" The internet boom is not tulipomania: it has already wrought far too much social change for that. But it might, Wyatt speculates, end up looking in hindsight a lot like CB radio: initially a cult among specialists; a sudden, skyrocketing surge in popularity, and then, well . . . not much, really. Mentioning one's email address at the better sort of party, it seems, might one day be as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as loudly informing the assembled gathering of one's CB call sign. Like any technological revolution - farming or factories, trains or televisions - the internet has long attracted its fair share of evangelists, and at first we believed them. \"The first wave of hype was: everything is going virtual,\" says the US media critic and author Jon Katz. \"Everything - all movies, all books - would go online. It was a classic moral panic, a hysteria.\" But then, in 1995, two Americans, James Katz and Philip Aspden, noticed something strange. The two academics had been preparing a survey on internet use. They only included the category of \"former internet user\" for conceptual clarity: logically, such a being could exist, but they didn't expect that any actually would. And so they were taken aback when their survey revealed that 8% of their sample had peered into the infinite depths of cyberspace - and decided they didn't like what they saw. What is it that these early rejecters - and the many more identified in the Virtual Society? survey - didn't like? One seductive argument is the ubiquitous claim that the internet just isn't human, that it isn't part of Woolgar's \"real world\" - that we simply won't be \"fooled\" by a virtual, and therefore somehow inferior, version of life. But the explanations often turn out to be rather different. For one thing, researchers report, it's expensive: there are pieces of hardware to buy, internet service providers to subscribe to, telephone bills to pay - and then more, better hardware to buy, and so on. (Most free providers still can't match the level of service of the paid-for ones, and unmetered access, finally on the horizon, still costs money.) More crucially, though, the promise that it would simplify our lives didn't seem anywhere close to being realised. The Virtual Society? researchers confirmed most office workers' suspicions with their finding that email is adding to, not solving, the problem of information overload. We fret over writing them, because we know they can be stored and used against us, and then we hold meetings to discuss those emails. \"Email has increased, rather than reduced, the number of face-to-face meetings,\" write Dr Steven Brown and Dr Geoff Lightfoot in the report, \"since meetings are now held to resolve disputes arising from electronic communication.\" And above all the internet is simply too slow. Advances in technology had prompted vast increases in the amount and speed of information that could be transmitted on the net - but the volume of information has grown even faster: elaborate web pages, data-heavy movies and music. To disinter the oldest of internet metaphors, we kept adding new lanes to the information superhighway and - just as on the M25 - new cars arrived from nowhere. \"We're going through a healthy process of discovering that the internet is good for some things and bad for others,\" says Jon Katz. \"There was too much money being thrown at too many companies for too many dubious reasons.\" But he doesn't share the doom-mongers' view that this means the cyber-revolution is drawing to a close. \"People are confusing this new air of reality with the idea that the internet is over.\" But something is changing. Deep beneath the highways and the seabeds of the industrialised world, telecommunications companies are laying thousands of miles of fibre-optic cables that will carry communications on the internet at the speed of light - and herald, so the enthusiasts say, an era that will reduce the net of the 1990s to a similar status to that held today by the ZX Spectrum and Betamax video recorder. \"We are now entering a new era,\" writes the breathless George Gilder, the leading prophet of this \"bandwidth revolution\", in his new book Telecosm. \"A new form of PC will be dominant. It may not do Windows, but it will do doors. Tetherlessly transcending most of the limitations of the current PC era, the most com mon PC will be a digital cellular phone. And, oh yes, it will unlock your front door or car door, open your garage door, or even play Jim Morrison songs.\" The instant, infinite internet - whose working title, among the techies currently beavering away on its more arcane elements, is the \"evernet\" - will eliminate many of the internet's biggest turn-offs at a stroke, rendering once-grainy movies at cinema quality and music to rival the sounds of a concert hall. Meanwhile, at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a new invention, \"electronic paper\", promises soon to remove the discomfort of reading books on a computer monitor. \"It's like Evel Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon,\" says Mike Butcher, news editor of the Industry Standard Europe, the new economy bible, demonstrating a panache for metaphor typical of those who struggle to communicate these changes to a lay audience that is enthusiastic but out of its depth. \"There is a chasm between internet access now and access whenever you want it, wherever you want it: via your TV, your mobile phone. Right now, we're mid-jump.\" You have to be young to understand this, Jon Katz argues - and he means young . \"If you're not 13, it's almost impossible to keep up with the culture. The internet empowers and liberates young people by giving them access to so much information that it creates an enormous chasm between the young and the old,\" he says. \"But just as it was a mistake to assume that the internet was ever going to change everything, it's a bigger mistake to conclude that it is ever going to go away.\" In any case, \"using the internet\" is becoming an ever vaguer concept. Not only are we presented with the prospect of net connections in our fridges and earrings; we are already, even the greatest Luddites among us, using the internet at one remove when we do business with any of the thousands of major companies that deal with each other via electronic markets or organise their distribution and payments systems over the web. At least some of the teenagers who are logging off in their hordes are turning to text messaging on their mobile phones - a technology that doesn't currently use the internet but will soon, as fully internet-connected mobile phones come to market. And herein lies another way of reading the Virtual Society? study's findings: more of us may no longer think of ourselves as using the internet, but only because it has permeated our lives so deeply that we can no longer see the distinction between using it and not using it. It may be only when we no longer think of ourselves as internet users that the virtual age will truly have arrived.",

In the absence of any other evidence (particularly from witnesses who are likely to be intimidated) communications data will be the only means of securing a prosecution. Deletion of data would seriously damage the ability of the agencies to reactively investigate acts of terrorism.\"</p> <p>Mr Gaspar, who says he wrote his report to the Home Office on behalf of MI5, MI6, GCHQ, and Customs, as well as the Association of Chief Police Officers, wants all communications service providers to retain their records for seven years. Some now delete their records after 24 hours.</p> <p>\"It is not just the current communications data that is needed,\" says Mr Gaspar. \"Identification of users (particularly with anonymous pre-paid mobiles) is invariably dependent upon research through older data and analysis of links with other callers and locations. This kind of research is used so frequently that at least two major software programmes exist for the analysis of this data. All law enforcement agencies use these programmes.\"</p> <p>In a revealing insight into the activities of the security and intelligence agencies, Mr Gaspar says it is difficult to overstate the value of communications data as an intelligence tool.</p> <p>\"The intelligence officer's toolbox of techniques comprise informants, eavesdropping, interception, observation, surveillance and analysis of latent data,\" he says. \"Latent data is both open and closed source material which is created by our everyday human activity and can range from the Electoral Role [sic] and DVLA [the vehicle licence agency] to that retained in bespoke intelligence databases.</p> <p>\"Major criminal conspiracies,\" he adds, \"utilise the same business techniques as legitimate business and consequently communications between criminal associates is a crucial component.</p> <p>\"Whereas the Kray brothers had to rely on a physical location to run and control their criminal structure... the more common structure of organised criminality today has far wider geography.\"</p> <p>The proposals, which would require legislation, conflict with the right to privacy enshrined in the data protection and human rights acts, civil rights groups say.</p> <p>\"It is clear the police want the ability to track every citizen as they go about their business,\" said John Wadham, director of Liberty.</p>",

Though individuals suspected of involvement in the Omagh bombing, which killed 29 people, have been named in the media, none has been charged. \"The only evidence currently available to link suspects is that provided by data from the use of their mobile phones,\" Mr Gaspar says. \"This places them within the proximity of the incident.\" He adds: \"Recent advances in location-based customer services have reached the stage where more precise data can now pinpoint the whereabouts of the user of a mobile phone at a specific time. In the absence of any other evidence (particularly from witnesses who are likely to be intimidated) communications data will be the only means of securing a prosecution. Deletion of data would seriously damage the ability of the agencies to reactively investigate acts of terrorism.\" Mr Gaspar, who says he wrote his report to the Home Office on behalf of MI5, MI6, GCHQ, and Customs, as well as the Association of Chief Police Officers, wants all communications service providers to retain their records for seven years. Some now delete their records after 24 hours. \"It is not just the current communications data that is needed,\" says Mr Gaspar. \"Identification of users (particularly with anonymous pre-paid mobiles) is invariably dependent upon research through older data and analysis of links with other callers and locations. This kind of research is used so frequently that at least two major software programmes exist for the analysis of this data. All law enforcement agencies use these programmes.\" In a revealing insight into the activities of the security and intelligence agencies, Mr Gaspar says it is difficult to overstate the value of communications data as an intelligence tool. \"The intelligence officer's toolbox of techniques comprise informants, eavesdropping, interception, observation, surveillance and analysis of latent data,\" he says. \"Latent data is both open and closed source material which is created by our everyday human activity and can range from the Electoral Role [sic] and DVLA [the vehicle licence agency] to that retained in bespoke intelligence databases. \"Major criminal conspiracies,\" he adds, \"utilise the same business techniques as legitimate business and consequently communications between criminal associates is a crucial component. \"Whereas the Kray brothers had to rely on a physical location to run and control their criminal structure... the more common structure of organised criminality today has far wider geography.\" The proposals, which would require legislation, conflict with the right to privacy enshrined in the data protection and human rights acts, civil rights groups say. \"It is clear the police want the ability to track every citizen as they go about their business,\" said John Wadham, director of Liberty.",

While Vorhaus was directing Pardon My French (1951) in France, the directors Edward Dmytryk and Frank Tuttle namedhim as a communist to Huac. Finding themselves also persona non grata in France and Italy - where Bernard had made Fanciulle di lusso (Luxury Girls, 1952) - Vorhaus and his wife settled in Britain.</p> <p>The son of a lawyer, Vorhaus became hooked on films before the first world war, when, as a small boy, he would accompany his sister Amy, 12 years his senior and a script- writer, to the local film studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey. There, he picked up scraps of film to edit and show on his toy projector at home. After Harvard, he resisted pressure to join the family law firm, and, through connections with the mogul Harry Cohn, found work as a film writer.</p> <p>His debut as director was an independently-produced, silent two-reeler, Sunlight (1928), which was a casualty of the talking picture revolution. Vorhaus consoled himself with a trip to Britain, and stayed. He found work making dirt-cheap \"quota quickies\", films churned out to take advantage of the quota imposed on cinemas in order to protect domestic production.</p> <p>His luck was to find himself at Twickenham film studios, founded and run by the former actor Julius Hagen, who had the rare merit among British tycoons in that he loved movies (although he was as tough as the rest in his financial control). Vorhaus marvelled at the quality of the Twickenham technicians, dedicated to making the best films they could under the circumstances.</p> <p>Good at spotting talent, he took on a young British Movietone newsreel cutter, David Lean, to work on two of his first British features. The best of his hour-long melodramas, thrillers and comedies - The Ghost Camera (1933), which debuted Ida Lupino, Crime On The Hill (1933), Dusty Ermine (1936), Cotton Queen (1937) - are distinguished by their intelligence, imagina tive camerawork and, whenever possible, use of locations rather than cramped studio sets. His most impressive work, The Last Journey (1936), is the story of a train driver who, in despair at losing his job and - he wrongly believes - his wife, recklessly drives the packed London-to-Manchester express with suicidal intent. It is exemplary in dramatic structure, suspense and characterisation.</p> <p>Vorhaus had married Hetty, then working in a telephone exchange, in 1932. A gifted pianist and, later, portraitist, she was also a tireless campaigner for radical and humanitarian causes, from the 1926 general strike to Greenham Common in the 1980s. Her young husband wanted her \"to learn about films so that we could share our life\", and she rapidly became a talented film editor and dialogue director on his and other directors' films.</p> <p>In 1937, Vorhaus accepted a Hollywood contract with Republic Pictures, whose chief, Herbert J Yates, was impressed by his ability to work within the low budgets that were the studio's speciality. Vorhaus's 16 Hollywood films are mostly forgotten, though they seem to have maintained much of the same qualities as his British films. He was often associated with leftwing writers, such as Samuel J Ornitz and Ring Lardner Jr, and gave his first Hollywood work to the Hungarian cinematographer John Alton, who went on to photograph An American In Paris and Teahouse Of The August Moon.</p> <p>During the second world war, Vorhaus rose to the rank of major and worked for the US Army Air Force motion picture unit alongside the (then liberal) Ronald Reagan. In 1945, he directed an official feature-length documentary, The Yalta And Potsdam Conferences, which Vorhaus regarded as probably the most important film he made. It was destroyed on US state department orders, as east-west relations declined. In 1952, he buried his one remaining copy of the film in the hills above Sunset Strip.</p> <p>A fter the war, Vor-haus and Alton had worked together on Vorhaus's last, and most fondly remembered, Republic film, an eerie psychological thriller entitled The Amazing Mr X (1948), alternatively known as The Spiritualist. He left Republic to make one independent production, an earnest social drama, So Young, So Bad (1950).</p> <p>By this time, however, cold- war Hollywood was becoming uncomfortable - and along came Huac. In the late 1930s, the Vorhauses had campaigned for the republican cause in the Spanish civil war - Hetty had a nightly pro- republican radio slot in Los Angeles - and they were involved in movements like the Anti-Fascist League and the League of American Writers.</p> <p>After leaving America for Britain, in 1952 Vorhaus took architecture classes, and launched a successful property conversion enterprise. During the Vietnam war, he became a British citizen. He was an active member of the Labour party, and caught up in Hetty's radical causes: a correspondent in Vietnam at the height of the war, she hosted events for Paul Robeson, the Chilean communist poet Pablo Neruda, and Jane Fonda; she was a leading figure in the British Peace Committee and fought for Philip Agee, the former CIA officer who had denounced the agency.</p> <p>Vorhaus's film career went virtually forgotten until 1985, when David Lean revealed his debt to him, in a television interview.

      "bodyText": "The poet Elma Mitchell, who has died aged 81, first came to public attention in middle life, when her devastatingly original poem, Thoughts After Ruskin, appeared in the 1967 PEN anthology. Two years later, the same poem was included in a group submitted anonymously to the 1969 Camden festival poetry book prize under the title of Seasons And Enquiries. The judges - the then poet laureate Cecil Day Lewis, Edward Lucie-Smith and Anthony Thwaite - chose it as the winner. The poem presents a quirkily original view of the nature of women, and, as in all Elma Mitchell's work, links the apparently trivial minutiae of domestic existence with the most urgent human concerns: Women reminded him of lilies and roses. Me they remind rather of blood and soap, Armed with a warm rag, assaulting noses, Ears, neck, mouth and all the secret places. The poem goes on to detail \"all the terrible chemistry of their kitchens\" and a whole list of customary household activities, delivered with great gusto: Their distant husbands lean across mahogany And delicately manipulate the market, While safe at home, the tender and the gentle Are killing tiny mice, dead snap by the neck, Asphyxiating flies, evicting spiders, Scrubbing, scouring aloud, disturbing cupboards, Committing things to dust- bins, twisting, wringing, Wrists red and knuckles white and fingers puckered, Pulpy, tepid. The poem modulates to a deliberately ambivalent ending: And when all's over, off with overalls, Quickly consulting clocks, they go upstairs, Sit and sigh a little, brush- ing hair, And somehow find, in mir- rors, colours, odours, Their essences of lilies and roses. While this poem has been deservedly much anthologised, it has served to deflect attention from the quality of Mitchell's whole oeuvre of heart-rending, compassionate, compelling and rhythmically skilful verse.

      "bodyText": "Russia is trying to revive its declining arms industry and military sales by exploiting market openings among America's enemies as part of President Vladimir Putin's policy of pursuing a more assertive foreign policy and restoring a sense of power among his people. In the past couple of weeks, senior officials have pledged to kickstart military cooperation with North Korea, and the defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, is expected to visit Tehran in the next few weeks - a move that could signal the ditching of a clandestine agreement with the White House to phase out arms supplies to Iran. The Russians are shopping for military orders in Libya, Mr Putin is about to visit Cuba, and last week the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, made two visits to Moscow. And despite US, British and French opposition, the Russians last week called for the end of a United Nations arms embargo on Yugoslavia. But, according to Jane's Defence Weekly, Moscow's biggest arms customer to date is China, which will shell out up to $15bn (\u00a310bn) in the next five years on Russian military equipment that could neutralise any US attempt to defend Taiwan. Where Washington sees a rogue state, Moscow is increasingly seeing a market niche. \"As far as public opinion is concerned, the west is no longer seen as a reliable partner,\" said Konstantin Kosachev, a former senior diplomat and deputy head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. \"There's a big shift in foreign policy taking place. It's about looking after our own national and economic interests.\" Iran is currently Russia's biggest bone of contention with the US. In the secret 1995 agreement, Moscow bowed to US pressure and assented to halting arms sales to Tehran by last year. It failed to redeem the pledge and now says it is no longer bound by the deal. The armed forces newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, said that new contracts with Iran could be worth up to $8bn. This is probably an inflated estimate but indicates that the potential profits outweigh any possible penalties imposed by the Americans, who have the Iranian state blacklisted as a \"sponsor of terrorism\". \"The decision on Iran was taken a long time ago, last year during the Kosovo war,\" said Alexander Pikayev, a military analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre. \"But it was not made public to avoid trouble.\" Russian and American experts are to discuss the row this week, with the US state department's spokesman, Richard Boucher, warning: \"We have made clear to the Russian government that there would be consequences if Moscow withdrew from such a commitment and that certain kinds of arms sales could lead to sanctions.\" According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was a distant second to the US in the world arms sales league table last year, fuelling Russian complaints that the US consistently sought to keep Russia out of the arms market in the 90s. While the jury is out on whether the once-mighty Russian arms sector will be able to deliver on its sales pitches, the president moved last month to streamline his arms sales department by sacking the managers of the two main export organisations, merging them into a single new agency and putting a former KGB colleague in charge. \"The US was supposed to compensate for our losses in halting sales to Iran by helping to promote Russian weaponry in other markets, including Nato countries,\" said Krasnaya Zvezda. \"Not only did this not happen, but Washington tried to put spokes in the wheels anywhere Russia had a chance to do profitable deals.\" Mr Kosachev said such behaviour was \"the west's great strategic mistake. The western market was closed to Russian arms. The only markets left are where there is no serious western competition.\" Under US pressure earlier this year, the Israelis retreated from a deal to supply China with sophisticated electronics for Russian-made A-50E planes. These are the Russian equivalent of the Awacs early warning aircraft. Following a recent visit to Beijing by Mikhail Kasyanov, the prime minister, Moscow is now to provide the avionics as well as the planes. China has ordered four A-50Es at a cost of $800m. The impact of projected Russian sales to China of submarines, fighter aircraft, naval missile systems and the A-50Es has the US, Japan, Taiwan and India worried that such armaments could secure mastery for Beijing of Taiwanese airspace and the waters of the Taiwan Straits. Further signs of a resumption of the old superpower rivalries surfaced last week when the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe was unable to issue a declaration aimed at resolving the conflict in Chechnya after it was blocked by Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister. For the first time since the end of the cold war, meanwhile, the defence ministry sent five \"Bear\" strategic bombers on training exercises in the Arctic, where they are expected to probe US air defences. This type of plane has nuclear capability. \"Putin's power has been dependent on the military and security structures,\" said Mr Pikayev. \"The arms trade is important to them.

If we are all postmodernists, maybe we can all be curators, and if curators, why not artists? After all, Picasso didn't give a jot how early Iberian sculpture, a Congolese mask, a cardboard guitar and the head of an old man from a Pyrenean village might come together in his work. All became grist to his mill. But watching British Museum curators style-mixing and sampling is like watching your dad dance to hardcore. </p> <p> The museum, a repository of stories as much as of objects, re-inters what it preserves. In the section called Abstraction, felt-penned walruses by a native Canadian called Penn rub shoulders with a Jacob Epstein drawing of so-called \"Primitive Figures\" with huge sex organs. Primitive, maybe; daft certainly. Hereabouts, too, a Yemeni grave marker, a simplified, honey-coloured alabaster head, which even the catalogue recognises as an attempt to \"catch the essence of an individual, emphasising the salient features of the human face\". The rubric Abstraction means little more than that these things look a bit like modern art. </p> <p>I shuttle back and forth, making my own connections. But I know, too, that once the exhibition is open, sheer numbers of visitors are likely to defeat an attempt to play this game. And game it is, to reshuffle these poor objects again and again. I come away from The Human Image knowing that I have seen some great objects and images but unable to make any meaningful sense of their collisions. Look, I want to say, there are fabulous things here: an Alaskan wooden figure with fox's teeth; a Mayan maize god with a beautiful head; a real human skull, from Jericho, from the 8th millennium BC, a skull somehow re-animated with plaster, giving the form of flesh, with shells for eyes; a Gustave Courbet self-portrait- the young artist smug and sly and self-regarding; a tiny Egyptian ivory figure of a girl, with lapis lazuli eyes, her hands folded across her belly, pin-pricked nipples. How anyone can make any kind of sense at all of these conjunctions without losing their way is beyond me. Here are deities, jokes, ritual objects, symbols. We can only surmise their original meanings, the intentions of the hands that made them. All we know is that the human image endures, even in the museum, and that a thing no bigger than your fist can be as resonant and compelling as all that space, all that architecture.

      "body": "<p>A rich father wants his son to go to Oxford. No surprise there. Except that the son apparently is not quite qualified enough to get in on his own merits and daddy, who is used to getting just what he wants (even though some claim that he is now down to his last \u00a310bn), is keen to secure the coveted place by using his contacts. </p> <p>This, surely, is exactly the problem with both Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Whether it is relevant that the father in question is the Sultan of Brunei (once the richest man in the world but now, tragically, down to third) or not, the oddly familiar scenario does make you wonder. Why is it that the sultan wants his offspring to go to Oxbridge at all? Especially if he is going to struggle academically. </p> <p>Magdalen college, which has had its fair share of publicity this year, is the place fortunate enough to have been chosen by the sultan as fitting the bill for his son, Prince Azim. </p> <p>Magdalen, of course, is the college that turned down Laura Spence (the middle-class girl held up to epitomise the working-class struggle to break the Oxbridge elite, who had the foresight to apply to Harvard just in case). Which makes the story even juicier. But perhaps it is time to move away from the issue of elitism and query why everyone is so keen to go to Oxbridge in the first place. </p> <p>The prime minister and his opposite number were both educated at Oxbridge. Although there may be fewer of these people in government than in the past, Oxford and Cambridge continue to revel in their traditional role as the only places to educate the elite (that is, the intellectual rather than moneyed elite, although there has been rather a crossover). In the past, the two universities were undeniably head and shoulders above the opposition. But that is no longer true. </p> <p>During the Laura Spence saga, I longed to ask her why she had wanted to study medicine at Oxford. My curiosity increased when, after telling the world that she was desperate to be a doctor, Laura chose instead to take a Harvard scholarship to study biochemistry. </p> <p>The reason, I am pretty sure, is that Miss Spence is a bit of a snob herself. After all, if you are looking for a university with cachet and Oxford won't take you, Harvard is clearly a delightful option. Far better, if that is what you are after, than other British medical schools. Even though, as the recent teaching assessments for medicine show, Oxford comes below Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton, Leicester and St George's, to name just a few. </p> <p>Now they have become paying consumers, surely A-level students should look harder at which universities offer the best teaching when they apply. It is fine to consider whether a location offers a good nightlife, is far away enough from home and is not too expensive. But it isn't - or shouldn't be - fine to apply to a university because it has a good \"name\" or for its historical legacy. </p> <p>When I was at school, \"bright\" students were encouraged to apply to Oxbridge as a matter of course. It didn't matter if Imperial College was better for science, the LSE for economics or Bristol for history; Oxbridge was what counted. And that was before league tables. </p> <p>My school wasn't alone. Across the country, children grow up with the idea that, when it comes to higher education, Oxbridge is the pinnacle. True, they may also think that it is for an elite, for people such as young Freddie Windsor (currently studying at - where else? - Magdalen college, Oxford), or those who dream of punting along rivers and going to May balls. They may decide it is not for them, that they would have more fun in a bigger city or in a more modern setting. But it would be a rare pupil who would dismiss these two universities on the basis of their teaching. </p> <p>The Sultan of Brunei may be doing us all a favour. It is time to start a debate that is not just about why certain students from certain types of school proliferate at Oxford and Cambridge. </p> <p>Let's forget about trying to \"open up\" the colleges to people from different backgrounds. If one of the richest men in the world wants to send his son to Oxford, fine. Leave our oldest universities to those who care about snob value. Students should apply to the best university they can for what they want to study. </p> <p>Oxford and Cambridge - which are better funded than all our other universities - should offer the best courses in every subject or lose their exalted position in our national psyche.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A rich father wants his son to go to Oxford. No surprise there. Except that the son apparently is not quite qualified enough to get in on his own merits and daddy, who is used to getting just what he wants (even though some claim that he is now down to his last \u00a310bn), is keen to secure the coveted place by using his contacts. This, surely, is exactly the problem with both Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Whether it is relevant that the father in question is the Sultan of Brunei (once the richest man in the world but now, tragically, down to third) or not, the oddly familiar scenario does make you wonder. Why is it that the sultan wants his offspring to go to Oxbridge at all? Especially if he is going to struggle academically. Magdalen college, which has had its fair share of publicity this year, is the place fortunate enough to have been chosen by the sultan as fitting the bill for his son, Prince Azim. Magdalen, of course, is the college that turned down Laura Spence (the middle-class girl held up to epitomise the working-class struggle to break the Oxbridge elite, who had the foresight to apply to Harvard just in case). Which makes the story even juicier. But perhaps it is time to move away from the issue of elitism and query why everyone is so keen to go to Oxbridge in the first place. The prime minister and his opposite number were both educated at Oxbridge. Although there may be fewer of these people in government than in the past, Oxford and Cambridge continue to revel in their traditional role as the only places to educate the elite (that is, the intellectual rather than moneyed elite, although there has been rather a crossover). In the past, the two universities were undeniably head and shoulders above the opposition. But that is no longer true. During the Laura Spence saga, I longed to ask her why she had wanted to study medicine at Oxford. My curiosity increased when, after telling the world that she was desperate to be a doctor, Laura chose instead to take a Harvard scholarship to study biochemistry. The reason, I am pretty sure, is that Miss Spence is a bit of a snob herself. After all, if you are looking for a university with cachet and Oxford won't take you, Harvard is clearly a delightful option. Far better, if that is what you are after, than other British medical schools. Even though, as the recent teaching assessments for medicine show, Oxford comes below Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton, Leicester and St George's, to name just a few. Now they have become paying consumers, surely A-level students should look harder at which universities offer the best teaching when they apply. It is fine to consider whether a location offers a good nightlife, is far away enough from home and is not too expensive. But it isn't - or shouldn't be - fine to apply to a university because it has a good \"name\" or for its historical legacy. When I was at school, \"bright\" students were encouraged to apply to Oxbridge as a matter of course. It didn't matter if Imperial College was better for science, the LSE for economics or Bristol for history; Oxbridge was what counted. And that was before league tables. My school wasn't alone. Across the country, children grow up with the idea that, when it comes to higher education, Oxbridge is the pinnacle. True, they may also think that it is for an elite, for people such as young Freddie Windsor (currently studying at - where else? - Magdalen college, Oxford), or those who dream of punting along rivers and going to May balls. They may decide it is not for them, that they would have more fun in a bigger city or in a more modern setting. But it would be a rare pupil who would dismiss these two universities on the basis of their teaching. The Sultan of Brunei may be doing us all a favour. It is time to start a debate that is not just about why certain students from certain types of school proliferate at Oxford and Cambridge. Let's forget about trying to \"open up\" the colleges to people from different backgrounds. If one of the richest men in the world wants to send his son to Oxford, fine. Leave our oldest universities to those who care about snob value. Students should apply to the best university they can for what they want to study. Oxford and Cambridge - which are better funded than all our other universities - should offer the best courses in every subject or lose their exalted position in our national psyche.",

Patience, however, is running thin. </p> <p>Over the past year, the management has been consumed by a vast consultation exercise. Mather's scheme has been fleshed out, and the South Bank is now willing to give a timetable for rebuilding. But there remain two great bugbears - planning consent and money - that could scupper the whole scheme. </p> <p>It had been predicted that the Festival Hall, which is to have a \u00a350m overhaul, would close for refurbishment in 2002/3. The resident orchestras, the London Philharmonic and the Philharmonia, had assumed they would be homeless for that period and made alternative arrangements, but they have now been told there will be no closure until 2005/6 at the earliest.

The management has admitted that the acoustic is unsatisfactory (Simon Rattle said playing there sapped his will to live), yet now audiences are stuck with it for at least another five years. </p> <p>Witt is putting a brave face on the delay. He says he never publicly committed himself to closing in 2002/3 and that phasing the changes will be less disruptive. \"Instead of rushing into a closure period, which would have the advantage that we could do everything at the same time, we will take an incremental approach, which will allow us to be more flexible,\" he says. \"But that doesn't mean we will postpone everything. My hope is that at the end we will need a shorter closure period.\" </p> <p>The South Bank has about half of the \u00a350m it needs to complete the refurbishment of the Festival Hall and is embarking on a fund-raising drive to coincide with next May's 50th anniversary of its opening. Reg ular concertgoers are being solicited for contributions, and a gala concert on May 3 will inaugurate a month of celebratory events. </p> <p>Instead of pressing on with major structural changes to the grade I-listed Festival Hall as originally envisaged, Witt hopes to start work at the Hungerford Bridge end of the site. The car park will be grassed over and the area landscaped to form sloping gardens. Beneath this newly created green space, which London mayor Ken Livingstone is apparently keen to open while still in office, will be a new film centre (incorporating a five-screen National Film Theatre, the revamped Museum of the Moving Image and the British Film Institute's headquarters), along with the 1,350-seat concert hall, and, perhaps, a smaller hall to replace the Purcell Room. </p> <p>Witt is passionate about the idea of a new medium-sized venue. \"What in other places is regarded as the basis of the music business doesn't exist in this city,\" he says. \"You don't have any place where you can properly perform a Mozart symphony. I want a hall which offers the intimacy of a chamber-music hall but has the space for Mozart symphonies, early music, choir music and spatial music.\" Once the new venue is built, the Queen Elizabeth Hall would lose its chamber music function and specialise in amplified music, performance and dance. </p> <p> Serge Dorny, chief executive of the London Philharmonic, is worried about the focus on the new hall \"A new hall is clearly attractive to funders,\" he says, \"but the danger is that if the new hall is built before the Festival Hall gets done, the latter will be forgotten about.\" </p> <p>A competition has been launched to find an architect for the Hungerford Bridge site, which will include a mixed-use \"gateway\" building and retail units. Work on the site will cost around \u00a380m, and commercial development will be crucial in raising the capital. Witt has been loath to be tied to a figure for the entire South Bank redevelopment but it will be at least \u00a3200m, with 25% likely to come from lottery funds, 25% from donations and the rest from retail and office development. The current estimate makes the overall plan look reasonable compared with recent schemes. The redevelopment of the Royal Opera House cost \u00a3214m, of which a third came from the lottery, and the Tate Modern came in at \u00a3134m, with 40% lottery funding. But \u00a350m to refurbish the Festival Hall looks high compared with the \u00a330m it cost to construct the Symphony Hall in Birmingham (one-third of which came from European Union funds) and \u00a342m for Manchester's Bridgewater Hall. Witt has been fighting to get the Festival Hall figure down. It is odd that it costs more to refurbish a hall than to construct one. </p> <p>The South Bank hopes to have an architect in place for the Hungerford Bridge site by next spring, to submit plans by the autumn, to start work in 2002, and to finish construction in 2004/5.

Already well-known for his role as the arrogant, good-time Stuart in Queer as Folk - the drama that brought gay life and love to mainstream TV - Gillen's Shakespearean debut as Ariel in Jonathan Kent's production of The Tempest at the Almeida later this week will bring two years of non-stop work to a climax. </p> <p>Over Christmas he will be seen as Carver Doone in the BBC's production of Lorna Doone; and in January there will almost certainly be more attention with the release of Jamie Thraves's original and smart debut feature film The Low Down, in which Gillen stars as Frank, a confused man about to hit 30, who can't make up his mind whether to go for the mortgage and commitment or to stay a waster. This performance won Gillen the best newcomer award at this year's Edinburgh film festival. </p> <p>In the circumstances it's no surprise that 32-year-old Gillen (\"I look younger and feel older - much older\") is looking weary. The arrival of his second child six weeks ago, combined with rehearsals for The Tempest, are also taking their toll. \"Every couple of years - no, that's every couple of weeks - I think I'm going to give up acting. I heat myself up over the fact that I am never going to be as good as I want to be. I hate it when people tell you you're good when you know that you're not.\" </p> <p>Gillen has been acting since his early teens, when he joined his local Dublin youth theatre as a way to meet girls and get invited to parties. \"To start, I wasn't really interested in acting at all and I didn't make much impact. The first play I was in was on for five nights and I didn't show up for two of them and nobody noticed. But I stayed because that's where my friends were, and after a while I found myself wanting to inhabit other people's worlds and lives. I discovered that I enjoyed acting - although you can't deny that it's also about showing off and wanting people's approval.\" </p> <p>At 18 he auditioned for a role in Billy Roche's A Handful of Stars at the Bush, got it, came to London, felt lonely and has barely been out of work since, although he had a bare patch just before Queer as Folk. He still claims that his career feels like an accident - but his CV reeks of quality, with stints in Mojo at the Royal Court, the Playboy of the Western World at the Almeida and Juno and the Paycock at the National. </p> <p>While he clearly gets offered good stuff, he is canny enough to skim off the real cream. He spotted the quality of Russell T Davies's scripts for Queer as Folk as soon as he saw them and was keen to play Stuart, not least because the self-confident gay man who was always the centre of attention was a million miles away from his own persona. </p> <p>\"I felt I needed to confound people's perceptions of what they thought I was,\" says Gillen. He points out that the series has done his career nothing but good, though he was unprepared for the amount of attention - not all of it welcome - it brought him. He groans when I tell him that I've taken a tour of sites on the internet on which female and male admirers drool over him. </p> <p>One of the pleasures of Gillen's performance in The Low Down is the way in which he suggests that there is part of the hapless, personable, slightly comic Frank that is hidden, wild and totally unknowable. It is what gives the film its emotional ballast. </p> <p>Jonathan Kent, who is directing Gillen in The Tempest, recognises that quality in him too, describing it as \"a hinterland...There is a darkness in him that is fascinating,\" says Kent. He originally hadn't thought of casting Gillen, who had no Shakespearean experience and no drama-school training. He just happened to be having a drink with Gillen one day when the rightness of the casting hit him. \"I was sitting staring at him and I suddenly thought, 'I've been mad not to think of him. He is Ariel. Ariel is so elusive and so is Aidan.' \" </p> <p>\"Jonathan had to talk me into it. I was a bit worried because I've been used to doing a lot of muttering and mumbling as an actor,\" says Gillen. \"But I've discovered that once you know what you're talking about and you believe in it, the Shakespearean language comes naturally. </p> <p>\"What I've really found interesting is the antagonistic relationship between Prospero and Ariel, and the way they are tied together, like body and soul. It is as if Ariel represents the dying of Prospero's imagination.\" </p> <p>Gillen starts laughing at himself. He is a little over-analytical - a natural-born worrier. \"The reason I get in a tortured state about acting is because sometimes I don't think I feel enough anguish about it,\" he says. \"I want to care. I don't want to be apathetic. I want to move people. I'm not good at smiling. I'm not saying that I'm not interested in being famous but I'm more interested in being good, and I never feel that I am good enough.\" </p> <p>He gets up to leave and smiles. \"On the cusp, you say? The cusp. Yes, I'd say being on the cusp is a quite interesting place to be.\"</p>",

I discovered that I enjoyed acting - although you can't deny that it's also about showing off and wanting people's approval.\" At 18 he auditioned for a role in Billy Roche's A Handful of Stars at the Bush, got it, came to London, felt lonely and has barely been out of work since, although he had a bare patch just before Queer as Folk. He still claims that his career feels like an accident - but his CV reeks of quality, with stints in Mojo at the Royal Court, the Playboy of the Western World at the Almeida and Juno and the Paycock at the National. While he clearly gets offered good stuff, he is canny enough to skim off the real cream. He spotted the quality of Russell T Davies's scripts for Queer as Folk as soon as he saw them and was keen to play Stuart, not least because the self-confident gay man who was always the centre of attention was a million miles away from his own persona. \"I felt I needed to confound people's perceptions of what they thought I was,\" says Gillen. He points out that the series has done his career nothing but good, though he was unprepared for the amount of attention - not all of it welcome - it brought him. He groans when I tell him that I've taken a tour of sites on the internet on which female and male admirers drool over him. One of the pleasures of Gillen's performance in The Low Down is the way in which he suggests that there is part of the hapless, personable, slightly comic Frank that is hidden, wild and totally unknowable. It is what gives the film its emotional ballast. Jonathan Kent, who is directing Gillen in The Tempest, recognises that quality in him too, describing it as \"a hinterland...There is a darkness in him that is fascinating,\" says Kent. He originally hadn't thought of casting Gillen, who had no Shakespearean experience and no drama-school training. He just happened to be having a drink with Gillen one day when the rightness of the casting hit him. \"I was sitting staring at him and I suddenly thought, 'I've been mad not to think of him. He is Ariel. Ariel is so elusive and so is Aidan.' \" \"Jonathan had to talk me into it. I was a bit worried because I've been used to doing a lot of muttering and mumbling as an actor,\" says Gillen. \"But I've discovered that once you know what you're talking about and you believe in it, the Shakespearean language comes naturally. \"What I've really found interesting is the antagonistic relationship between Prospero and Ariel, and the way they are tied together, like body and soul. It is as if Ariel represents the dying of Prospero's imagination.\" Gillen starts laughing at himself. He is a little over-analytical - a natural-born worrier. \"The reason I get in a tortured state about acting is because sometimes I don't think I feel enough anguish about it,\" he says. \"I want to care. I don't want to be apathetic. I want to move people. I'm not good at smiling. I'm not saying that I'm not interested in being famous but I'm more interested in being good, and I never feel that I am good enough.\" He gets up to leave and smiles. \"On the cusp, you say? The cusp. Yes, I'd say being on the cusp is a quite interesting place to be.\"",

The Tory leadership, which has been exasperated by Mr Taylor's regular attacks on its European policies, has urged Tories in Esher to stand by their MP. In a firmly worded letter last week to the constituency chairman, John Burns, the Tory chairman Michael Ancram said that challenging the position of a MP because of his opinions had \"never been a part of our tradition\". Mr Ancram's letter did not signal a thaw in relations with Mr Taylor who regularly lambasts the Tory leadership in press releases issued by the Britain in Europe group. Tory Central Office highlighted its anger with Mr Taylor yesterday when a spokesman said that Mr Hague would not offer personal support for the beleaguered MP ahead of the vote.",

In January of that year, with 12 agency teachers drafted in and 12 existing members of staff \"acting up\" to more senior posts, the school was put into special measures by Ofsted.

Closure was ruled out because there were too many children to accommodate; a merger with Haberdashers' was floated but opposed by many of the CTC's parents, and by other secondary heads in the borough who were worried that the enlarged school would drain even more students away from local comprehensives.

Animal patients need very careful handling, possibly far more than humans, as often they are very frightened and it is much more difficult to calm an animal as they do not really understand that what is happening to them is for their own good! Nurses need to be quite adept at being able to perform several tasks at once. It is important that they are good at dealing with people both face to face and over the telephone. And they need administrative skills for handling and organising patient records. </p> <p><strong> What entry requirements are there?</strong> To get on the Royal College of Nursing Veterinary Training Scheme, you need five GCSEs including English language, maths and a science. Applicants must be 17 or over, but need parental consent under 18. Training must be at an approved training centre, usually a veterinary practice, and the training period usually lasts approximately two years, which includes practical work within the surgery and day release to college where exams have to be undertaken in order to qualify. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong>British Veterinary Nurses Association Ltd, </strong> Level 15, Terminus House, Terminus Street, Harlow Essex, CM20 1XA.<br> <strong>Telephone </strong>01279 450567 </p> <p><strong> Email</strong> <a href=\"mailto:bvna@compuserve.com\"> bvna@compuserve.com</a> </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, </strong> Belgravia House 62-64 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 2AF. </p> <p><strong> Telephone</strong> 0207 2222001</p> <p><strong> Website</strong><a href=\"http://www.rcvs.org.uk/rcvs/\">www.rcvs.org.uk/ </a></p> <p>\u0095<strong> The Blue Cross, </strong> Shilton Road, Burford, Oxford, OX18 4PF</p> <p> <strong> Telephone </strong>01993 822651</p> <p> <strong>Website </strong><a href=\"http://www.bluecross.org.uk\">www.bluecross.org.uk </a></p> <p>\u0095<strong> Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) </strong> Whitechapel Way, Priorslee, Telford, Shropshire, TF2 2PQ </p> <p><strong>Telephone</strong> 01952 290999 </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>RSPCA</strong>, Causeway, Horsham, West Sussex, RH12 1HG</p> <p><strong> Telephone</strong> 01403 264181 </p> <p>\u0095 learndirect 0800 100900 <a href=\"http://www.learndirect.co.uk\">www.learndirect.co.uk</a> may be able to give further information and advice on courses.</p>",

Although former colleagues who have moved into managerial posts try to lace their conversations with positive spin, she still hears plenty of discontent from the grassroots. Mostly, though, it's about pay scales, administrative overload and conditions of service these days, rather than corruption on a grand scale, so in her latest outing, Dying by Degrees, Sophie has moved on to pastures new.

I can't for the life of me remember who wrote it, though.\" </p> <p>She spent many happy years at Matthew Bolton College, and it was only towards the end that things went pear-shaped. She was badly beaten up by a student after she ticked her off for jumping up and down in the lift, and, shortly after she returned to work a male student shoved his hand up her skirt as she was climbing the stairs. </p> <p>\"My initial response was to lash out,\" she says, \"but I was suddenly aware that he and his friends could attack me, so I did nothing. In that same moment, I decided to take early retirement.

So she left her desk at 5.30 on a Thursday evening and at 9.00am the following morning she was teaching A-level English. \"I can remember the first text I taught,\" she says. \"It was a play called Tobias the Angel. I can't for the life of me remember who wrote it, though.\" She spent many happy years at Matthew Bolton College, and it was only towards the end that things went pear-shaped. She was badly beaten up by a student after she ticked her off for jumping up and down in the lift, and, shortly after she returned to work a male student shoved his hand up her skirt as she was climbing the stairs. \"My initial response was to lash out,\" she says, \"but I was suddenly aware that he and his friends could attack me, so I did nothing. In that same moment, I decided to take early retirement. I've heard the college has improved recently, but I've never wanted to go back.\" And neither, it seems likely, will Sophie. \u0095 Dying by Degrees is published by Headline this week.",

There are two routes in. Students can take law as a first degree and follow this up with a Legal Practice Certificate (LPC), which means a year's further study and a fee of anything up to \u00a36,000. Graduates with degrees other than law - and 50% of big city firms recruit non-law graduates - have to take a Post Graduate Diploma in Law (PGDL) conversion course, with fees up to around \u00a35,000, before they can study for their LPC.

And the struggles of self-funding students who have to work and study at the same time are reflected in their academic success. </p> <p>\"A disproportionate number of students who are working during their courses fail and have to take re-sits,\" he adds. \"It is a very intensive course and if you are working as a security guard at night, say, then you can't devote as much time to your studies.\" </p> <p>The University Careers Advisory Service has already noted that the number of mature students in all subjects is falling since the cut in funding for fees, and there is now a watching brief on how this will affect postgraduate student numbers. </p> <p>Dick Lidwell, chair of the legal profession committee for the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, says that postgraduate law student numbers are still holding up. </p> <p>His message is to research the profession thoroughly: \"Find out what the profession is and decide if you have the skills and interest before embarking on an expensive exercise and then not going into the profession.\" </p> <p>Big city firms are looking for people with intellectual skills and strong personal skills which are supported by their extracurricular activities. </p> <p>\"It is also important to have good commercial sense,\" he says. \"But if you want to be a high-street lawyer then you will need sensitivity and good interpersonal skills. Written and verbal skills are important for everybody.\" </p> <p>A Law Society study showed that the biggest deciding factor in job success was work experience in the profession. </p> <p>Law remains a popular option, and colleges are responding to the costs issue by means of their own. Britain's premier institution, the College of Law, which has campuses at London, Guildford, Chester and York, has a mission to provide legal training for students from all backgrounds. </p> <p>The director at Guildford, Imogen Burton, says: \"Ten to 15 years ago there was a lot more public funding from local authorities. This has all but dried up now. There are few sources of funding other than career loans from banks and sponsorship from the larger, mainly commercial firms. </p> <p>\"We are concerned particularly for students who want to specialise in other areas than corporate law.\" </p> <p> The College of Law has negotiated preferential rate loans with NatWest Bank for students and offers flexible part-time training for LPC and PGDL courses. \"Recently we have developed popular block weekend courses at our branches in Guildford, York and Chester to suit students who have to work to finance themselves.\" </p> <p>And Burton is optimistic about the future: \"New technology will help more students do more learning from home. The college is in the forefront of developing website and CD-rom learning.\"</p>",

And the struggles of self-funding students who have to work and study at the same time are reflected in their academic success. \"A disproportionate number of students who are working during their courses fail and have to take re-sits,\" he adds. \"It is a very intensive course and if you are working as a security guard at night, say, then you can't devote as much time to your studies.\" The University Careers Advisory Service has already noted that the number of mature students in all subjects is falling since the cut in funding for fees, and there is now a watching brief on how this will affect postgraduate student numbers. Dick Lidwell, chair of the legal profession committee for the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services, says that postgraduate law student numbers are still holding up. His message is to research the profession thoroughly: \"Find out what the profession is and decide if you have the skills and interest before embarking on an expensive exercise and then not going into the profession.\" Big city firms are looking for people with intellectual skills and strong personal skills which are supported by their extracurricular activities. \"It is also important to have good commercial sense,\" he says. \"But if you want to be a high-street lawyer then you will need sensitivity and good interpersonal skills. Written and verbal skills are important for everybody.\" A Law Society study showed that the biggest deciding factor in job success was work experience in the profession. Law remains a popular option, and colleges are responding to the costs issue by means of their own. Britain's premier institution, the College of Law, which has campuses at London, Guildford, Chester and York, has a mission to provide legal training for students from all backgrounds. The director at Guildford, Imogen Burton, says: \"Ten to 15 years ago there was a lot more public funding from local authorities. This has all but dried up now. There are few sources of funding other than career loans from banks and sponsorship from the larger, mainly commercial firms. \"We are concerned particularly for students who want to specialise in other areas than corporate law.\" The College of Law has negotiated preferential rate loans with NatWest Bank for students and offers flexible part-time training for LPC and PGDL courses. \"Recently we have developed popular block weekend courses at our branches in Guildford, York and Chester to suit students who have to work to finance themselves.\" And Burton is optimistic about the future: \"New technology will help more students do more learning from home. The college is in the forefront of developing website and CD-rom learning.\"",

They are influencing the conduct of business and attitudes are changing. Indeed, the Oxford that I work in today is appreciably different from that which John Kay left 18 months ago. For a new department of the university like the Said Business School (SBS), such changes are important. </p> <p>There is no doubt that these changes are facilitating the serious introduction of management studies into the university. Unlike the complex arrival of economics, the fraught introduction of medicine and the much contested recognition of English as a subject for teaching, management studies has had a much speedier and less contentious arrival. </p> <p>In the past year alone, there has been a 30% increase in MBA students. In every year of the programme we have had one of the highest average GMAT entry scores in Europe. This year ten Rhodes Scholars are on the programme. Within one year we have had a 60% increase in companies recruiting at SBS. The undergraduate programme is now one of the most oversubscribed in the whole university and the faculty is expanding with appointments of international stature at all levels. </p> <p>Areas of academic strength are already emerging. An extremely impressive new building is going up near the centre of the city. No one who knows Oxford could have imagined that within a few years management students would be at 29 of the university's 39 colleges with faculty at 22 and shortly at 26. Yet this is indeed the case. </p> <p>No university has been without problems in establishing a business school, and it would have been foolhardy to expect the process of introducing a new subject into such an ancient institution to be completely unproblematic. Seen in these terms, there is no doubt that John Kay identified some key issues. Equally, however, very real progress has been made in tackling these and the substantial achievements of staff and students at SBS today demonstrate that John was wrong to contend that \"creating an institution within Oxford which could compete with major international business schools was impossible\". </p> <p>Take the issue of salaries. John Kay had attempted to obtain higher salaries for just the school. In retrospect, that was doomed to failure as the economists, lawyers, engineers and so on all made their own completely legitimate cases. The key to moving forward was to introduce the general possibility of flexibility across the whole university. That has been done at the professorial level and is also emerging for others. </p> <p>The result is that this year we were able to make a number of high-profile appointments - including Professor Paul Willman, a senior academic from the London Business School, and Professor Steve Woolgar, the UK's leading authority on the impact of e-technologies. </p> <p>Governance structures for the school similar to those desired by John Kay are now likely to be implemented with the enthusiastic support of some of the most senior people in the university. And the university's new management arrangements require rigorous strategic plans and operating budgets. Now, however, they are looking for more than just a vision. The new approach demands both a vision and an action plan simultaneously. And, of course, the technical planning for the operation of our new building is in hand. Consultants are being appointed and the school has just advertised for a director of operations. Overall a much more businesslike approach is evident. </p> <p>A mass of other changes is transforming the University of Oxford. Real progress is being made, although in my mind it remains an open question as to whether the resolution of the specific problems cited by John Kay had to await the programme of reforms. </p> <p>John Kay undoubtedly found working with the grain of a complex academic institution frustrating. Just before departing he had attempted to embody his frustration in a new definition of his role as \"a non-executive Chairman Director\". This would have enabled him to adopt an external focus for his role at Oxford whilst maintaining his consultancy, journalism and speech-making interests. But that redefinition was not acceptable to his immediate colleagues, senior and junior, and John departed. </p> <p>He set in motion, however, processes that have resulted in the successful establishment of management studies in the university in an amazingly short period of time. Rather than striving for autonomy, SBS has started to develop the intellectual and practical linkages which its setting in a major international university enables, and from which the school itself and the wider university will inevitably benefit. </p> <p>By hosting the Oxford Science Enterprise Centre, it aims to be a catalyst for the commercial development of scientific knowledge. The school wants to be known as one that takes science seriously. By building links with the law faculty, it wants to be in a position to play a role in the creation of the new bodies of knowledge that are emerging at the interface between law and economic management. </p> <p>Starting to develop links with specialists in international relations and area studies, the school will provide a more substantive base for the study of business in its global context. The aim at Oxford is to have a business school that can relate to the wider university in a serious and productive way. This is now starting to happen. </p> <p>John and I share the view that introducing management studies to Oxford is of real importance, not just to Oxford, but also to knowledge, to business and to the wider intellectual community. </p> <p>When I was a member of the ESRC's Commission on Management Research a few years ago, I, along with all the other members, was amazed that no one could identify any significant British contribution to management knowledge since business schools had been established. All the major contributions had stemmed from university and similar departments outside the contexts of self contained business schools - the Aston School of contingency theory, the research of Joan Woodward at Imperial, research on product innovation and operations research at Sussex, socio-technical systems at the Tavistock Institute, and so on. </p> <p>The key challenge at Oxford is to forge the basis for an intelligent business school - one that is known for what it knows. To do this, SBS needs the wider university and, in today's rapidly changing world, the university needs a business school. Undoubtedly a lot remains to be done to achieve such high goals, but it has now been accepted that the Said Business School should be in the intellectual and physical centre of the university. That is a major achievement. </p> <p>\u0095 Professor Anthony Hopwood assumed the directorship of the Said Business School in December 1999. He arrived in Oxford in 1995 to establish its new MBA programme. He is currently president of the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels.</p>",

No one who knows Oxford could have imagined that within a few years management students would be at 29 of the university's 39 colleges with faculty at 22 and shortly at 26. Yet this is indeed the case. No university has been without problems in establishing a business school, and it would have been foolhardy to expect the process of introducing a new subject into such an ancient institution to be completely unproblematic. Seen in these terms, there is no doubt that John Kay identified some key issues. Equally, however, very real progress has been made in tackling these and the substantial achievements of staff and students at SBS today demonstrate that John was wrong to contend that \"creating an institution within Oxford which could compete with major international business schools was impossible\". Take the issue of salaries. John Kay had attempted to obtain higher salaries for just the school. In retrospect, that was doomed to failure as the economists, lawyers, engineers and so on all made their own completely legitimate cases. The key to moving forward was to introduce the general possibility of flexibility across the whole university. That has been done at the professorial level and is also emerging for others. The result is that this year we were able to make a number of high-profile appointments - including Professor Paul Willman, a senior academic from the London Business School, and Professor Steve Woolgar, the UK's leading authority on the impact of e-technologies. Governance structures for the school similar to those desired by John Kay are now likely to be implemented with the enthusiastic support of some of the most senior people in the university. And the university's new management arrangements require rigorous strategic plans and operating budgets. Now, however, they are looking for more than just a vision. The new approach demands both a vision and an action plan simultaneously. And, of course, the technical planning for the operation of our new building is in hand. Consultants are being appointed and the school has just advertised for a director of operations. Overall a much more businesslike approach is evident. A mass of other changes is transforming the University of Oxford. Real progress is being made, although in my mind it remains an open question as to whether the resolution of the specific problems cited by John Kay had to await the programme of reforms. John Kay undoubtedly found working with the grain of a complex academic institution frustrating. Just before departing he had attempted to embody his frustration in a new definition of his role as \"a non-executive Chairman Director\". This would have enabled him to adopt an external focus for his role at Oxford whilst maintaining his consultancy, journalism and speech-making interests. But that redefinition was not acceptable to his immediate colleagues, senior and junior, and John departed. He set in motion, however, processes that have resulted in the successful establishment of management studies in the university in an amazingly short period of time. Rather than striving for autonomy, SBS has started to develop the intellectual and practical linkages which its setting in a major international university enables, and from which the school itself and the wider university will inevitably benefit. By hosting the Oxford Science Enterprise Centre, it aims to be a catalyst for the commercial development of scientific knowledge. The school wants to be known as one that takes science seriously. By building links with the law faculty, it wants to be in a position to play a role in the creation of the new bodies of knowledge that are emerging at the interface between law and economic management. Starting to develop links with specialists in international relations and area studies, the school will provide a more substantive base for the study of business in its global context. The aim at Oxford is to have a business school that can relate to the wider university in a serious and productive way. This is now starting to happen. John and I share the view that introducing management studies to Oxford is of real importance, not just to Oxford, but also to knowledge, to business and to the wider intellectual community. When I was a member of the ESRC's Commission on Management Research a few years ago, I, along with all the other members, was amazed that no one could identify any significant British contribution to management knowledge since business schools had been established. All the major contributions had stemmed from university and similar departments outside the contexts of self contained business schools - the Aston School of contingency theory, the research of Joan Woodward at Imperial, research on product innovation and operations research at Sussex, socio-technical systems at the Tavistock Institute, and so on. The key challenge at Oxford is to forge the basis for an intelligent business school - one that is known for what it knows. To do this, SBS needs the wider university and, in today's rapidly changing world, the university needs a business school. Undoubtedly a lot remains to be done to achieve such high goals, but it has now been accepted that the Said Business School should be in the intellectual and physical centre of the university. That is a major achievement. \u0095 Professor Anthony Hopwood assumed the directorship of the Said Business School in December 1999. He arrived in Oxford in 1995 to establish its new MBA programme. He is currently president of the European Institute for Advanced Studies in Management, Brussels.",

      "body": "<p>When Amanda Williams (see below) began the final year of her BA degree with a four-month-old baby, there was no nursery on her campus and no childcare places in the area. She had two options: she could drop out, or she could take her baby into lectures and classes for a year, and do all her work at night. She chose the second route, went on to get a first and is now doing a part-time PhD. </p> <p>According to the Daycare Trust, the majority of UK universities and colleges feel there is not enough childcare provision at their institution to meet demand. While around 71% of institutions offer some provision, more than 40% were aware of students needing to drop out because of a lack of, or difficulties with, childcare. Most have long waiting lists and many parents who need a childcare place have difficulty getting one. </p> <p>For students who do succeed in finding childcare, the next problem is paying for it. Although many institutions with childcare provision offer subsidised rates to students, if there are no spaces they have to look elsewhere. With a full-time place in a private day nursery costing between \u00a380 and \u00a3200 a week, it is not surprising that student parents face greater hardship than almost any other category of students. </p> <p>Earning extra money by taking paid work in the evenings or holidays is often not an option for students with children. </p> <p>Measures announced by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, to widen access to higher education and tackle student hardship are coming into effect this present academic year. Full-time mature students, especially those with children, are one of the groups being targeted for help. </p> <p>A means-tested non-repayable access bursary of up to \u00a31, 000 to help mature students with dependent children with costs such as childcare and travel is available, and there is a new means-tested grant towards children's school meals. </p> <p>Mature students will also no longer be required to take out a hardship loan before receiving assistance from a hardship fund, which is non-repayable. The amount of income which mature students can have disregarded when they are assessed for entitlement to student support has been increased from \u00a3820 to \u00a37,500. </p> <p>But discretionary grants - such as access and hardship funds - are problematic for student parents. It is difficult to budget if you don't know how much you are going to get or when. Payments are often one-off lump sums, and parents are usually billed monthly for childcare. </p> <p>Students are unable to claim the Childcare Tax Credit, paid to low-income working families on Working Families Tax Credit, worth up to \u00a370 a week for parents with one child and \u00a3105 for those with two or more children. But from 2001, a new Childcare Grant of up to \u00a3100 per week per child will be introduced for student parents, largely replacing the \u00a31,000 bursaries. It will be means-tested and based on actual childcare costs. </p> <p>As yet, little is known about the grant, but if it follows the form of the Childcare Tax Credit as is suspected, it will pay only for registered childcare costs and will exclude informal childcare provided by friends, relatives and other non-registered carers. </p> <p>Yet many student parents depend on informal childcare or a mixture of formal and informal childcare arrangements. Lone parents in particular are known to use higher levels of informal childcare. They are also likely to experience the greatest hardship of any students, according to research by Professor Claire Callendar, professor in social policy at South Bank University. </p> <p>Margaret Creear, of the lone parents' organisation Gingerbread, says: \"Educational opportunities are immensely important to enable lone parents to break out of the benefits trap, and we need to be flexible in supporting those lone parents who do enter higher education.\" </p> <p>Postgraduates and part-time students (excluding trainee teachers) cannot apply for the childcare grant, or many of the other measures. </p> <p>According to Jeremy Hoad of the National Postgraduate Committee: \"Childcare costs represent a significant barrier to the increasing numbers of graduates wishing to retrain after starting a family. Postgraduates are also not eligible for student loans and this seems directly at odds with the lifelong learning agenda.\" </p> <p>The traditional image of student life does not include babies in lecture halls. There is also arguably a difference between being poor without family responsibilities, and raising a family on \u00a320 a week, as one student I spoke to did. But unless childcare provision is increased and students are given the means to afford it, many parents won't make it as far as the lecture hall. </p> <p><strong>A double life</strong> <br></p> <p> <strong> Amanda Williams, </strong>28, is a part-time PhD student in an arts-related field at a university in the south-west of England. She has a four-year old son. As a part-time student and lone parent, she is able to claim income support, but has been able to study only because her department set up a hardship fund to pay for her son's playgroup fees before he became eligible for a free nursery place.</p> <p>As an undergraduate, the problem was no childcare. As a postgraduate student parent, what I really notice is the grinding poverty. </p> <p>I had to apply for a social-fund loan because we couldn't afford to eat and this is now being deducted from my benefits. I can't afford books or attend conferences, and I need an internet connection to work from home, which costs. There is an incredible gulf between my academic and my social status - as a lone parent on benefits, you're at the bottom of the pit. This is my route out of the poverty trap and I'm grateful, but there must be thousands of other lone parents who just can't afford to study. </p> <p><strong> Kirsty Bauckham, </strong>35, is in the second year of a computing degree at Oxford Brookes and is president of the Sprogs society. She is a single parent with one daughter, Natalie, seven. </p> <p>I used to work at the University of Kent in Canterbury - it was a dead-end job and a computing degree was something I wanted to do for myself. I only had one O-level, so I did an access course to get into Oxford Brookes. </p> <p>My daughter was due to start school when I began my degree, so the first thing was finding her a place. But you couldn't get a school place until you had fixed accommodation: I approached the university accommodation office, hoping there'd be somewhere in halls for student parents. They were quite negative and sent me off to Oxford Brookes housing association, who help students who can't get places in halls. </p> <p>The day before the summer term finished they rang and said they'd found me somewhere, so I rushed around looking at schools and chose the one nearest to the university. The school gates open at 8.50am, so I drop her then run up the hill for 9.00am lectures. </p> <p>After a while of paying a standard rent I discovered the university does have three student-parent flats in halls, and one came up and I got it for \u00a31,300 a term - though unfortunately it's six miles from the campus. </p> <p>At the university they have a financial aid office who've helped out with \u00a31,100, non-repayable, this year. I get a student loan of \u00a33,790 a year, and a dependent's grant of \u00a33,175 a year from LEA, and work a few hours a week to earn extra. </p> <p>The university does have a nursery, but Natalie is too old for it - if I have a late lecture I pay for her to go to an after-school club. Oxford Brookes has a fantastic half-term playscheme for older children, though. </p> <p>The daily nursery doesn't open until 8.45am and closes at 5.10pm: it needs to be open longer.

      "bodyText": "When Amanda Williams (see below) began the final year of her BA degree with a four-month-old baby, there was no nursery on her campus and no childcare places in the area. She had two options: she could drop out, or she could take her baby into lectures and classes for a year, and do all her work at night. She chose the second route, went on to get a first and is now doing a part-time PhD. According to the Daycare Trust, the majority of UK universities and colleges feel there is not enough childcare provision at their institution to meet demand. While around 71% of institutions offer some provision, more than 40% were aware of students needing to drop out because of a lack of, or difficulties with, childcare. Most have long waiting lists and many parents who need a childcare place have difficulty getting one. For students who do succeed in finding childcare, the next problem is paying for it. Although many institutions with childcare provision offer subsidised rates to students, if there are no spaces they have to look elsewhere. With a full-time place in a private day nursery costing between \u00a380 and \u00a3200 a week, it is not surprising that student parents face greater hardship than almost any other category of students. Earning extra money by taking paid work in the evenings or holidays is often not an option for students with children. Measures announced by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, to widen access to higher education and tackle student hardship are coming into effect this present academic year. Full-time mature students, especially those with children, are one of the groups being targeted for help. A means-tested non-repayable access bursary of up to \u00a31, 000 to help mature students with dependent children with costs such as childcare and travel is available, and there is a new means-tested grant towards children's school meals. Mature students will also no longer be required to take out a hardship loan before receiving assistance from a hardship fund, which is non-repayable. The amount of income which mature students can have disregarded when they are assessed for entitlement to student support has been increased from \u00a3820 to \u00a37,500. But discretionary grants - such as access and hardship funds - are problematic for student parents. It is difficult to budget if you don't know how much you are going to get or when. Payments are often one-off lump sums, and parents are usually billed monthly for childcare. Students are unable to claim the Childcare Tax Credit, paid to low-income working families on Working Families Tax Credit, worth up to \u00a370 a week for parents with one child and \u00a3105 for those with two or more children. But from 2001, a new Childcare Grant of up to \u00a3100 per week per child will be introduced for student parents, largely replacing the \u00a31,000 bursaries. It will be means-tested and based on actual childcare costs. As yet, little is known about the grant, but if it follows the form of the Childcare Tax Credit as is suspected, it will pay only for registered childcare costs and will exclude informal childcare provided by friends, relatives and other non-registered carers. Yet many student parents depend on informal childcare or a mixture of formal and informal childcare arrangements. Lone parents in particular are known to use higher levels of informal childcare. They are also likely to experience the greatest hardship of any students, according to research by Professor Claire Callendar, professor in social policy at South Bank University. Margaret Creear, of the lone parents' organisation Gingerbread, says: \"Educational opportunities are immensely important to enable lone parents to break out of the benefits trap, and we need to be flexible in supporting those lone parents who do enter higher education.\" Postgraduates and part-time students (excluding trainee teachers) cannot apply for the childcare grant, or many of the other measures. According to Jeremy Hoad of the National Postgraduate Committee: \"Childcare costs represent a significant barrier to the increasing numbers of graduates wishing to retrain after starting a family. Postgraduates are also not eligible for student loans and this seems directly at odds with the lifelong learning agenda.\" The traditional image of student life does not include babies in lecture halls. There is also arguably a difference between being poor without family responsibilities, and raising a family on \u00a320 a week, as one student I spoke to did. But unless childcare provision is increased and students are given the means to afford it, many parents won't make it as far as the lecture hall. A double life Amanda Williams, 28, is a part-time PhD student in an arts-related field at a university in the south-west of England. She has a four-year old son. As a part-time student and lone parent, she is able to claim income support, but has been able to study only because her department set up a hardship fund to pay for her son's playgroup fees before he became eligible for a free nursery place. As an undergraduate, the problem was no childcare. As a postgraduate student parent, what I really notice is the grinding poverty. I had to apply for a social-fund loan because we couldn't afford to eat and this is now being deducted from my benefits. I can't afford books or attend conferences, and I need an internet connection to work from home, which costs. There is an incredible gulf between my academic and my social status - as a lone parent on benefits, you're at the bottom of the pit. This is my route out of the poverty trap and I'm grateful, but there must be thousands of other lone parents who just can't afford to study. Kirsty Bauckham, 35, is in the second year of a computing degree at Oxford Brookes and is president of the Sprogs society. She is a single parent with one daughter, Natalie, seven. I used to work at the University of Kent in Canterbury - it was a dead-end job and a computing degree was something I wanted to do for myself. I only had one O-level, so I did an access course to get into Oxford Brookes. My daughter was due to start school when I began my degree, so the first thing was finding her a place. But you couldn't get a school place until you had fixed accommodation: I approached the university accommodation office, hoping there'd be somewhere in halls for student parents. They were quite negative and sent me off to Oxford Brookes housing association, who help students who can't get places in halls. The day before the summer term finished they rang and said they'd found me somewhere, so I rushed around looking at schools and chose the one nearest to the university. The school gates open at 8.50am, so I drop her then run up the hill for 9.00am lectures. After a while of paying a standard rent I discovered the university does have three student-parent flats in halls, and one came up and I got it for \u00a31,300 a term - though unfortunately it's six miles from the campus. At the university they have a financial aid office who've helped out with \u00a31,100, non-repayable, this year. I get a student loan of \u00a33,790 a year, and a dependent's grant of \u00a33,175 a year from LEA, and work a few hours a week to earn extra. The university does have a nursery, but Natalie is too old for it - if I have a late lecture I pay for her to go to an after-school club. Oxford Brookes has a fantastic half-term playscheme for older children, though. The daily nursery doesn't open until 8.45am and closes at 5.10pm: it needs to be open longer. We also need more student-parent flats. My biggest fear now is that next year the computing department is moving to another campus seven miles away - so all the parent students will be late for lectures. Nine o'clock is a bad starting time for anyone with children. Siobhan McSorley, 22, graduated this year with a 2.1 in Sociology and Anthropology from Oxford Brookes University. She is a lone parent and has a four-year-old daughter, Billie. I had Billie before I went to university, and this influenced the course I chose and the university. I knew that I had to get on a course at the university in my home town as without a partner I would need my parents' support in looking after Billie. I was lucky, as Brookes has a nursery, which charges on a sliding scale, and there was a place. Brookes also has Sprogs - a group for student parents which organises activities for children and gives you contact with other parents. I also took a job in the student union bar so I could meet people. But if I hadn't had my parents to look after Billie I would have been paying all my wages straight to a childminder.

      "body": "<p>A week ago, 10-year-old Damilola Taylor was murdered on his way home from an after-school computer club. Three days earlier, five A-level students from King Edward VI College in Nuneaton were killed in a car accident. This isn't the way a life story is supposed to end and, thankfully, for most of us it doesn't. But early death is nowhere near as uncommon as we might like to think. </p> <p>In 1998, 7,487 young people in the UK aged 19 or under died prematurely through illness, accident or murder. This figure is no statistical anomaly, and it doesn't take a genius to work out that, over the course of a five-year period, few schools will escape losing at least one of their pupils. The potential for anxiety, grief and disruption among both staff and children is self-apparent and yet there are few protocols for handling such a situation. </p> <p>The National Union of Teachers issues no guidelines whatsoever, while the best the DfEE can offer is a few general emergency procedures that includes the catch-all \"schools have sometimes found it helpful to contact local community support services and to seek professional advice\". In other words, it's up to schools to make it up as they go along. </p> <p>On the day after Damilola Taylor was murdered, the Oliver Goldsmith school in Peckham, south London, was besieged by journalists and TV crews who remained encamped outside the gates for the next four days. The head teacher, Mark Parsons, appeared in a state of shock as he was ambushed into making an unprepared statement to TV, and by the end of the week Southwark education authority made a point of taking him out of the firing line, and left Bola Ogun, chair of governors, to deal with the media fallout. </p> <p>\"We're all in a state of shock,\" said Ogun. \"Staff and pupils still can't comprehend what's happened and it's almost as if they're hoping they will wake up and feel it's been a bad dream. The media have been very difficult to deal with; some journalists have tried to get into the school without authority and others have offered children up to \u00a3200 for a photo of Damilola's classroom. </p> <p>\"The bullying issue has made things even worse. Damilola's brother and cousin talked through what had happened with Mark on the day after the murder, and I think they were comforted that the proper procedures had been observed. We have a duty to protect the children in our care, but Damilola needed wider protection from society. Something went tragically wrong and it is the school that is wrongly being held to account.\" </p> <p>Keith Butterworth, principal of King Edward VI College, knows how Ogun feels. He found himself totally unprepared for some of the consequences of the car accident. \"We've had hate mail, the receptionist has been abused by an anonymous caller, we've had a video and charity box stolen by someone who reckoned we'd be preoccupied elsewhere and we've had journalists ringing up pretending to be members of staff,\" he says. </p> <p>Butterworth's first step was to work closely with the police to deflect as much attention from the families and the college as possible. \"We arranged for a press conference for the Monday morning, so we could release a prepared statement and so members of staff and students wouldn't be met by the press on the way into college,\" he continues. \"We also held a meeting of staff, students and governors on the Sunday, during which we decided to cancel lessons for Monday and make Tuesday a half day. In their place we organised a series of tutor groups where students could come to the college, talk things over and leave messages for the families\" </p> <p>The college was also closed last Friday. \"We initially did this as a mark of respect to remember the event a week on,\" he says, \"but it's turned out to be a good idea in other ways, as we had all underestimated just how physically and emotionally exhausting the week would be.\" The college is also alert to the long-term effects on the students, and universities and exam boards have been asked to take the accident into consideration over the course of the coming year. </p> <p>The possibilities for getting it wrong are endless. A south London primary school was devastated at the start of this term when it discovered that one of its children had drowned on holiday. The school decided to hold an assembly to mark the young girl's death and to allow the other pupils the opportunity to express their own feelings of grief for her. \"It was embarrassing at times,\" said one of the teachers. \"One of the boys who spoke in front of the whole school said, 'She was a bit of a slag, but I'll miss her,' while one of the girls started talking about how she had been bullied by this girl.\" </p> <p>Children have not yet learnt the adult language of obsequy and sometimes have little concept of an appropriate response to death. Similarly, they may well struggle to come to terms with what it means: younger children may just see it in cartoonish Tom and Jerry images, while older kids frequently interpret death as punishment and fear that if they behave badly they, too, will die. How then can you best contain a child's feelings? </p> <p>\"No one should ever try to normalise the death of a young person,\" says Julia Fabricius, director of the Anna Freud Centre. \"It is a terrible event and it is important to stress just how terrible and unusual it is. Children should be given all the available information about what has happened, but shouldn't be forced to talk about it if they don't want to. Similarly, children should be offered counselling, but not be made to have it. There are a huge variety of responses to grief, and it's important to recognise that the normal grieving process can last for up to two years. So even if a child appears initially to be OK, teachers and parents should be alert for any changes in mood or behaviour.\" </p> <p> How a school responds may well depend on how expected or unexpected the child's death may have been. In the course of the past three months, two children at Ysgol Dyffryn Nante, a Welsh comprehensive with just 430 pupils on register, have died of long-term illnesses. Both deaths were tragedies for their family and friends, but there was at least time to prepare. </p> <p>\"We'd had time to talk to the children about the possible outcomes,\" says head teacher Dewi Jones. \"Cancer and death had been discussed as part of the personal health and social education syllabus, and connections had been made.\" </p> <p>It was a very different matter, though, when a third pupil died suddenly a few weeks ago. \"He went home from school laughing on the Friday afternoon,\" Jones continues. \"The next day he had an asthma attack and died. I was extremely worried about what effect his death might have on the rest of the school - that the sight of his empty desk on the Monday morning might create a snowball of anxiety.\" </p> <p>Over the weekend Jones contacted the local authority's director of education and they arranged for a Cruse-trained welfare officer and an educational psychologist to be present at the school first thing on the following Monday morning. The pupils were then told what had happened and were invited to talk to the two support staff if they felt like it. Some went in groups of 10, some in pairs, some singly; others declined the offer. \"Everything was organised in consultation with the family,\" he continues. \"We held a service for the whole school, and we arranged visits to the family for those who wanted to meet them. Both the pupils and the family found this very helpful and on the day of the funeral the whole school stood in the field beside the road as the procession went past.\" </p> <p>One woman who knows rather more than she would want to about child death is Daryl Peek, the former head teacher of Northbourne Church of England primary school. In 1996, one of her pupils was brutally murdered in an attack that made front page news. Josie Russell survived, but both Megan and their mother died. Like Keith Butterworth at King Edward College, she too found the intrusion of the media hard to handle. \"We couldn't function as a school,\" she says. \"We were besieged by reporters and photographers and many of the children were extremely frightened.\" </p> <p>Peek had been informed of the murders on the previous night, and had called in Kent LEA, which sent two educational psychologists to the school to help cope with the situation when the news was officially released. </p> <p>\"We decided to tell the children everything, so they wouldn't feel excluded,\" she says. \"Our main focus, though, was to help them deal with it in their own way and to explain that there was no right or wrong way of feeling upset. \"We also explained that it was OK to carry on laughing, and that they needn't feel guilty if they did.\" </p> <p>Importantly she also recognised that some children might have ambivalent feelings for Megan and Josie, and in order that these could be expressed appropriately she suggested they be written down and then burnt. </p> <p>The lasting effects of such traumas on children are hard to gauge. All one can confidently predict is that the better the school copes with the situation, the less the long-term impact. There are plenty of professionals with experience of dealing with these problems. So why has no one yet thought of asking them to work together to produce a definitive set of guidelines for all schools? </p> <p> <strong>Do the right thing</strong></p> <p> Suggested guidelines for schools, written by the Candle Project, part of the St Christopher Hospice, which works with bereaved children in south-east London. </p> <p>\u0095 Communicate with other parents.

      "bodyText": "A week ago, 10-year-old Damilola Taylor was murdered on his way home from an after-school computer club. Three days earlier, five A-level students from King Edward VI College in Nuneaton were killed in a car accident. This isn't the way a life story is supposed to end and, thankfully, for most of us it doesn't. But early death is nowhere near as uncommon as we might like to think. In 1998, 7,487 young people in the UK aged 19 or under died prematurely through illness, accident or murder. This figure is no statistical anomaly, and it doesn't take a genius to work out that, over the course of a five-year period, few schools will escape losing at least one of their pupils. The potential for anxiety, grief and disruption among both staff and children is self-apparent and yet there are few protocols for handling such a situation. The National Union of Teachers issues no guidelines whatsoever, while the best the DfEE can offer is a few general emergency procedures that includes the catch-all \"schools have sometimes found it helpful to contact local community support services and to seek professional advice\". In other words, it's up to schools to make it up as they go along. On the day after Damilola Taylor was murdered, the Oliver Goldsmith school in Peckham, south London, was besieged by journalists and TV crews who remained encamped outside the gates for the next four days. The head teacher, Mark Parsons, appeared in a state of shock as he was ambushed into making an unprepared statement to TV, and by the end of the week Southwark education authority made a point of taking him out of the firing line, and left Bola Ogun, chair of governors, to deal with the media fallout. \"We're all in a state of shock,\" said Ogun. \"Staff and pupils still can't comprehend what's happened and it's almost as if they're hoping they will wake up and feel it's been a bad dream. The media have been very difficult to deal with; some journalists have tried to get into the school without authority and others have offered children up to \u00a3200 for a photo of Damilola's classroom. \"The bullying issue has made things even worse. Damilola's brother and cousin talked through what had happened with Mark on the day after the murder, and I think they were comforted that the proper procedures had been observed. We have a duty to protect the children in our care, but Damilola needed wider protection from society. Something went tragically wrong and it is the school that is wrongly being held to account.\" Keith Butterworth, principal of King Edward VI College, knows how Ogun feels. He found himself totally unprepared for some of the consequences of the car accident. \"We've had hate mail, the receptionist has been abused by an anonymous caller, we've had a video and charity box stolen by someone who reckoned we'd be preoccupied elsewhere and we've had journalists ringing up pretending to be members of staff,\" he says.

Desmond has recently bought the Express, further blurring the line between business and exploitation. When a porn baron takes over a national newspaper, how do we read the signs?</p> <p>Desmond would argue, as they all do, that there is no exploitation. The sex industry fulfils a need and pays a wage. We won't go into the differential between how much most of the women are paid and how much most of the men make, as photographers or agents or publishers. Even if the women took their real share of the money, the industry is still an exploitative one. Why? Because it exploits every woman on the planet. The majority of women do not want to pose for sleazy magazines, nor do they want to be thought of in those terms. I know men claim they can think of their wife in one way and a sex model in quite a different way, but the message is uniform. This is what women are for. Take their clothes off and they're all the same. They want sex all the time. They want it from strangers. They want it from you.</p> <p>I know two men who use pornography regularly. One travels home on the same train as I do and sometimes I have to sit next to him. I am often the only woman in the small first- class carriage and the camaraderie of pinstripe and gin and tonic is stifling enough, without having Hustler by my elbow. The man is discreet, he is polite, but it makes me uncomfortable. I told him so on one occasion and he said, kindly: \"It's not about you.\"</p> <p>The second man I know through his girlfriend. She feels undermined by the magazines by the bed, but can't say anything because she'll lose him. He tells her she's not liberated and doesn't have a sense of humour. What's interesting is that her despair and my discomfort are dismissed by both men as our problem. Pornography is not the problem. We are.</p> <p>This is the message of the magazines. Far from being sex that dare not speak its name, and hiding in a brown wrapper, soft porn is as ordinary as a page three girl. The success of the pornographers has been to use their nursery vocabulary - \"romp\", \"giggle\", \"tease\", \"tug\", \"playful\", \"girls\", \"bounce\", \"cuddly\", \"toy\", \"spank\", \"naughty\" - as a defence as well as a turn-on. There's nothing threatening here. It's just a \"frolic\".</p> <p>Mixed in with the nursery is the adolescent graffiti of toilet walls - \"horny\", \"wank\", \"pussy\", \"cum\", \"spunk\", \"tit\", \"suck\", \"hole\". It's as easy to read as a tabloid headline and about as intelligent. Before I'm told I shouldn't be taking my brain to bed, let me say that none of the women in the magazines I've read this weekend has any brains - or maybe their brains are removed for the photographs and put back afterwards. I couldn't care less about naked women all over the place - a woman's body is never offensive - I care that these women are made to look stupid, sound stupid and act stupid. That's what's degrading - not waving your arse in the air, but being turned into a stupid cunt.</p> <p>Sorry for the language but how often do you hear it on the streets? Now you know why.</p> <p>Let's look at the pictures. There's not a lot of variety. How can there be? Once you've shot it every way up, a body is just a body. To disguise this sameness, and to justify the growing quantity of porn, the titles become the most inventive thing in the magazine. What's the difference between 40 Plus and 50 and Over? There isn't one. What does Nude Readers' Wives have that X-treme doesn't? Nothing.</p> <p>Weirdly, porn-lingo is always ahead of porn-pics in selling the stuff. It's rather like the way kids love to repeat the first handful of words they learn. The vocabulary of shelf-porn is dick-shrinkingly tiny, but it's a multiple orgasm to pornographers and their readers. Take away the titles and suggestive coverlines, and I would defy anyone to tell which magazine they are looking at.</p> <p>For me, the most disturbing element in all the drying sameness is the shaved pubic hair. How many women actually shave their pubic hair? According to the sex mags, all of us. In real life, the only females without pubic hair are little girls. Do you remember the story of Ruskin's impotence? The only naked women he had seen before his marriage were Greek statues and they, of course, are hairless. When he got married, he recoiled in horror from his wife's bush and never went near her again. Are our private parts so scary that we either have to turn them into pre-pubescent fantasies or preparation for the operating theatre?</p> <p>The lesbians are no different. That is, the tease-lesbians who take up an astonishing amount of bed-space in men's porn. Men are threatened by lesbians - they get on in the world and they might get off with your wife. In porn-land, lesbians are safe sex-toys, who blither about how much better it is with a boy on hand (or somewhere) and act about as aroused as a castrated guinea pig. They always have lots of floppy blonde hair. They have long fingernails, too, which tells me they never put themselves where a man has right of way.</p> <p>Right of way is what porn-land is all about. It may be that men's insecurity in a changing world, where their role and power has been reduced, prompts the need for a fantasy world that offers itself as reality. A world where men are on top. A world where sex-barter is the only exchange between men and women. It's a comforting, closed world where women are at once everywhere and excluded. It's a conservative world, where for all the panting poses, there is neither freedom nor change.</p> <p>Week after week, it's the same old stuff, and I don't mean the women, I mean the way they are represented. Women change. Pornography stays the same. At least heterosexual porn does. The battle to get gay porn in the high street is not about morals, it's about what upsets existing fantasies. It's fine to see women playing at being lesbians, but what if they really fancy each other? Anyone who has looked at gay men's porn will realise what's radical about it is the self-conscious theatre. Nobody pretends it's real life. Queers don't need to prop up assumptions of male and female, so when it comes to sex, we know how to have fun. If you're a porn-reading straight male, that's even worse than having to deal with a real woman.</p> <p>It looks like those mad old feminists were right after all.

Since then, in his London appearances at least, he has tended towards other composers, especially Beethoven, but in his two recitals at the Festival Hall this season he has returned to Schumann, and to some neglected pieces at that. Next April he is due to play the early Allegro Op 8 alongside Kreisleriana; here he gave a rare outing to the Concert sans Orchestre, also known as the Sonata No 3 in F minor, Op 14. It is a strange work, both wonderful and unsatisfactory, another part of the great outpouring of piano music from the late 1830s, when Schumann was forcibly separated from Clara Wieck. He later revised and expanded it, but Pollini played the first published version in three movements built around a central set of variations on a theme by Clara herself - the emotional heart of the work. The first movement is an embattled conflict between Schumann's natural flights of fantasy and his determination to tackle sonata form, the finale a brilliant Presto, written as a tribute to the great virtuoso Moscheles, and as demanding as anything he wrote. The F minor Sonata is the kind of piece that needs a Pollini, someone to take a grip on the structure yet master all its technical challenges, and he did exactly that. It had been prefaced by more Schumann, the Davidsbundlertanze, in which Pollini had seemed surprisingly nervous, pushing through lyrical movements when they cried out for expansiveness, never allowing the effect of one magical phrase to settle before launching into the next, and sometimes understating the melodies that well up beneath dazzling figuration. Liszt followed. The B minor Sonata - prefaced by a pair of the late short pieces, Nuages Gris and La Lugubre Gondola, long-time Pollini favourites - was immense, ferociously precise, intense and insistent in the slow movement, and superhumanly fast in the climactic double fugue, a performance of take-it-or-leave-it integrity. The encores were Chopin - the D minor Prelude, glittering, turbulent; and a Nocturne, sung with wonderful purity of line. Altogether one of Pollini's finest recent London recitals.</p>",

This music was a psychotic jigsaw which dissected and fused together swing, rock, free jazz, chamber music and the greatest hits of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Through it all what was most striking was Bates's use of juxtaposition and contrast, and his constant thwarting of expectations. When the quartet glided smoothly, the keyboards were spiky and neurotic. When the electronic ambience washed in, the saxophone and drums twittered anxiously. Heart-wrenching emotions were conjured up in near silence, and mad, free-style instrumental aggression had the audience shouting with laughter.

Because it is self-select, investors can have complete control over what goes into their ISA, picking and choosing only the shares they want. As such, E*TRADE hopes it will appeal to the 88% of adults who, in a recent NOP-commissioned study, said they would like more control over their finances. Wannabe-investors will need to be financially savy enough to know which shares to pick, but E*TRADE is confident that its educational information, content and tools will help investors make decisions.

He can tell us little we don't already know about the psychology of sport or the way we flag up our identity through following a team. But, though these concepts lurk in some of his work (especially in Work in Progress, portraits of amateur footballers in Italian team shirts), this is not really Buchanan's interest. </p> <p>Several works make this clear. Peloton, a large-scale projection of coverage of the 1998 Tour de France, distils the three-week race into four hours, editing out everything but aerial coverage. With no winners or losers, no close-ups of key cyclists, the event loses its sportiness and becomes a purely visual spectacle as the riders snake their way through the countryside like a huddle of insects. The same interest in the economy of movement shapes Change Up, an installation showing an ice-hockey team in rehearsal. As they swoop round the two goals and sweep across the ice, their manager tells them to \"change up\" - go faster. It is compellingly hypnotic: you are caught between the two goals, with the players weaving round you, the only sounds their cries of encouragement and frustration, and the noise of the skates on ice. It steals the show. </p> <p>Much of the work here has been seen before, most notably the sweetly nostalgic video Gobstopper - showing the child's game of holding one's breath through the Clyde Tunnel - for which Buchanan won Becks Futures earlier this year. Sodastream, a video of pop bottles being dropped and smashed, powerfully evokes teenage street corner boredom, and is typical of Buchanan's work: a deceptively simple idea, with a visual treat (the way the fizz spreads out and retracts when it hits concrete; the different colour fizzes made by different drinks) and strong emotional engagement. </p> <p>These same principles lie behind Out, Buchanan's first 35mm film, commissioned by DCA for the exhibition. A brief, beautiful work, it follows a rollerblader's descent through a multi-storey car park. There are arty reference points (the car park looks like a mini-Guggenheim; skaters used to use the site now occupied by DCA before the arts centre was built), but really the film is interested in the moment of anticipation before the descent begins rather than any end point. Just as it should be, it is the taking part, and not the winning, that matters to Buchanan, and the visual, rather than physical, thrill of it all. </p> <p> Until February 4.
