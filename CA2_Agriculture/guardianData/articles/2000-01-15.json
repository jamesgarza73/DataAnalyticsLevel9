It was quick, just a big 'whoosh' and then it was gone. Those were the days when I had some hair, and I looked like Bart Simpson with it all stood in the air.

I soon frightened it off.\" </p> <p>His current mission is to halt a downward spiral that has left Blackpool's diminishing fan base afflicted with a severe case of vertigo in recent years. They have been a club in decline for longer than they would care to remember, the victims of unfulfilled promises on a downstream tide which has left them washed up and hung out to dry. </p> <p>Blackpool's main reception doubles as the club shop. The terraces are strewn with moss. Old posters flap from dilapidated stands, and what is left of the tangerine paintwork hangs away from crumbling walls engulfed by the unedifying stench of years of neglect. The repair job will be immense in a town where the youthful supporters of tomor row prefer to spend their Saturday afternoons in the gaudy amusement arcades on the Golden Mile rather than the wind-buffeted terraces of Bloomfield Road. </p> <p>When Blackpool beat Cambridge United in November, the visiting manager Roy McFarland did not attempt to hide his embarrassment with the damning verdict: \"Blackpool are the worst side I have seen in two years - and we still lost.\" </p> <p>But this is a more experienced McMahon than the one who at Swindon had his fingers so badly burned. He guided them to the Second Division championship in 1995-96. They led the First Division in November 1997. He was talked about as a future Liverpool manager - and then it all went horribly wrong. </p> <p>Before his appointment Swindon's leading players had negotiated Premiership wages for themselves, and the financial burden was too much for a club of humble means. With the red bills gathering, McMahon was ordered to break up his side. Another day, he arrived at work to be told that five of his backroom staff would have to go. </p> <p><strong> Sanctuary</strong><br> </p> <p>The team went into free fall and McMahon was blamed. His wife Julie was verbally abused outside the ground, and supporters invaded the pitch after a 4-1 home defeat by Watford. Finally he decided enough was enough and moved his family back to Merseyside. </p> <p>Since then he has joined the labour-exchange-for-out-of-work managers that is Sky Sports, as well as working with the under-16s at Everton, where his son Stephen is on the books. </p> <p>As he opens a generous pile of good-luck messages in his less-than-palatial office, he composes his argument for leaving the sanctuary of Sky's studios to succeed Nigel Worthington in charge of a team at the wrong end of the Second Division, where supporters have taken to providing hand-outs for new transfers and the owner Owen Oyston has a rape conviction on his curriculum vitae. </p> <p>\"The media work is enjoyable but I never thought of it as a long-term thing,\" he says. \"Some people get into that comfort zone, but not me. I took my coaching badges long before I stopped playing and management has always held something for me. </p> <p>\"They were difficult times at Swindon, but don't forget I am in their history books as one of only two managers who have won them a championship. They never wanted me to leave. In fact they begged me to stay. But losing my staff because of all the cost-cutting was the last straw. They told me on a Friday and I had to make sure it was done before the weekend. It was like cutting off my right arm. </p> <p>\"I did well there and I knew that whoever took over could not do as good a job. When you look at the club now, it hasn't kicked on since I left, has it?\" </p> <p>Privately McMahon still harbours ambitions to manage Liverpool but, like the golf, that has been put on the back burner.

Kevin Keegan has quashed his international call-up after the Wimbledon left-back elbowed an opponent in the face. </p> <p>Keegan had planned to include Thatcher in the England squad for the first time for the friendly at home to Argentina on February 23, even dubbing him the new Stuart Pearce. </p> <p>The England coach watched Thatcher's assault on Sunderland's Nicky Summerbee during a Premiership game on January 3, then took the rare step of placing the former Under-21 captain's senior debut on hold. </p> <p>The Football Association used video evidence to charge the 24-year-old Thatcher with misconduct over an incident missed by the match officials, and on Wednesday gave him a two-match suspension. </p> <p>Now Keegan has added to his misery. \"I think Thatcher, until last week, was someone we were looking at. I thought, there is one who probably would be in the next squad and probably will not now. </p> <p>\"There was no pressure from within here [the FA] about that. But that is how I feel just looking at the incident.\" </p> <p>However, Keegan added that it should not have any effect in the long term. \"I think that what he did would not necessarily jepoardise an England career,\" he said. \"He is one we have looked at because he can play left-sided centre-back and left full-back. He is, in my opinion, the nearest thing we have to Stuart Pearce.\" </p> <p>This is not the first time that Thatcher has been in trouble with England. He was sent off playing for the under-21s in Italy in 1997 and was one of five players disciplined over an off-the-field incident on the same trip. </p> <p>Though Keegan has come down hard on Thatcher, he is prepared to exercise understanding elsewhere: towards David Beckham and his red card in the World Club Championship, for example. </p> <p>\"The way I saw the tackle was that David Beckham turned blind and saw a guy coming who also had his leg raised pretty high. </p> <p>\"You get to the point of no return. I think David Beckham got to that point and then thought 'Oh' and he protected himself.\" </p> <p>There was also understanding from Keegan of Michael Owen's struggle to regain his form and fitness. \"People were too quick to say that he had got three goals in four games and that he was back after his injury lay-off. In truth he probably needs 20 games, especially after a hamstring injury.\" </p> <p>Keegan expects at least another 20 games as coach. He has no intention of quitting, even if England fall some way below his expectation of a place in the Euro 2000 final. \"It is my intention not only to see out my contract but hopefully to get another one.\" </p> <p>He is particularly relieved that his captain Alan Shearer is back on song, and for that thanks the departure of Ruud Gullit and the arrival of Bobby Robson at Newcastle. </p> <p>\"You want Alan Shearer coming into your England squad fetching a confidence from club level and that was not happening early season at Newcastle because of results and the way the club was going,\" he said. \"But Bobby has realigned him a bit - like with the wheels on your car - and I think Alan needed that. He has gone from what could have been a real nightmare to finding everything he wants at Newcastle.\" </p> <p>Finally Keegan, mindful of the lack of midfield creativity in his side, offered this message of hope to young Joe Cole of West Ham United: \"Euro 2000 is not too early for him if he continues the way he is going. He has got to make progress and make it rapidly, but Michael Owen did.\" \u0095 England have booked 54 suites in the luxury Balmoral hotel in Spa, near the venue for the Belgian grand prix, to serve as their base during Euro 2000.</p>",

He has no intention of quitting, even if England fall some way below his expectation of a place in the Euro 2000 final. \"It is my intention not only to see out my contract but hopefully to get another one.\" He is particularly relieved that his captain Alan Shearer is back on song, and for that thanks the departure of Ruud Gullit and the arrival of Bobby Robson at Newcastle. \"You want Alan Shearer coming into your England squad fetching a confidence from club level and that was not happening early season at Newcastle because of results and the way the club was going,\" he said. \"But Bobby has realigned him a bit - like with the wheels on your car - and I think Alan needed that. He has gone from what could have been a real nightmare to finding everything he wants at Newcastle.\" Finally Keegan, mindful of the lack of midfield creativity in his side, offered this message of hope to young Joe Cole of West Ham United: \"Euro 2000 is not too early for him if he continues the way he is going. He has got to make progress and make it rapidly, but Michael Owen did.\" \u0095 England have booked 54 suites in the luxury Balmoral hotel in Spa, near the venue for the Belgian grand prix, to serve as their base during Euro 2000.",

Reid first tried to sign Bould in 1988 when he was a player-coach at Everton under Colin Harvey. \"It was a source of major disappointment to me that I failed, but one I've cured 12 years down the line,\" the Sunderland manager said. \"Before a game I look round the dressing room, see Steve Bould and Thomas Sorensen and think to myself: 'They've got to get past both of them to score.'

They should be trying everything they can to try and turn things around. I believe that this sort of situation would probably have been addressed back in November at most other Premiership clubs. We feel that it is necessary we intervene for two reasons - to lift and motivate the team and to re-engage the supporters. </p> <p>\"The four of us feel that this football club belongs to the fans and to the community and that its future is a matter for that community. The demise of Sheffield Wednesday would greatly affect the local community,\" he added. \"In my opinion it would be best for the club if Danny Wilson was to leave.\" </p> <p>Although Blunkett could best be described as an irregular visitor to Wednesday's senior games, Betts and Michie are season-ticket holders and Ashton was one of five Wednesday vice-presidents until he resigned that post yesterday afternoon, declaring it was time to \"return to the terraces where I come from and where I can express my opinions in an open way\". </p> <p>Betts was equally forthright in his criticism. \"Any other Premiership club would have sacked the manager by now,\" he said. \"He has had some money but he hasn't spent it well. I don't dislike Danny Wilson; I was in favour of his appointment. But you judge people on results.\" </p> <p>After the poorest start to a season since the Premiership was formed in 1992 Wednesday are currently four points adrift at the foot of the table, having won two of their 20 league games. However, Wilson remains popular with a high percentage of his club's long-suffering support. </p> <p>Most criticism has been levelled at a board of directors which has overseen a fall from grace on the pitch and an almost unparalleled descent into debts estimated at \u00a315m. </p> <p>Last night the row even prompted a split within the Labour Party when Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader and arguably the club's most celebrated fan, insisted that Wilson should keep his job. \"It is not my view that he should be sacked,\" he said. \"I share the MPs' concern but I don't think he should go.\" </p> <p>Wilson declared himself to be more concerned with the timing of the MPs' comments rather than their message. </p> <p>\"I just think it is pathetic timing,\" he said. \"I would have thought people of their stature would have known better. If they want to keep blasting their mouths off, I can't do anything about that. I've got broad shoulders.\" </p> <p>This afternoon Wednesday play host to their fellow-strugglers Bradford City, a match which could well shape their destiny. </p> <p>While the dismissal of the 40-year-old Wilson has, for several weeks, been regarded as an inevitability rather than a mere possibility, the beleaguered Wednesday board of directors handed him a third vote of confidence in two months yesterday. </p> <p>\"I am staggered and saddened to learn of the MPs' brutal attack on Danny Wilson and their call for him to be sacked,\" said the Wednesday secretary Alan Sykes, speaking on behalf of the club's directors. \"This shows a total lack of respect for Sheffield Wednesday and for everyone involved with the club.\" </p> <p>The chairman Dave Richards said: \"My initial reaction is to tell them to get on with the business of politics while we get on with the business of football.\" </p> <p><strong>Ashton's final stand</strong></p> <p><strong> Letter from Joe Ashton MP to Alan Sykes, Secretary, Sheffield Wednesday FC</strong> </p> <p>Dear Alan, Further to our telephone conversation this morning I am formally, by fax, submitting to you my resignation as a vice-president of Sheffield Wednesday. Having been a season-ticket holder for 40 years and a shareholder for 25 years, it is something I do with great regret, especially following the newspaper revelations of a private meeting four Sheffield-area MPs had at the Charterhouse Bank in the City of London yesterday. However, as you know following the heated exchanges I had with the chairman at Stamford Bridge and Villa Park and other games recently, I can no longer support the board in its current policies, either financial or football. </p> <p>Following the 8-0 defeat at Newcastle I told several members of the board that drastic action was necessary to stay in the Premier League and I have continued to say so ever since. Unfortunately no sign of any action was forthcoming. Consequently, it is better if I return to the terraces where I came from and where I can express my opinions in an open way in a genuine debate on the future of Sheffield Wednesday. I hope you will communicate this letter to the board of directors. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, </p> <p>Joe Ashton MP</p>",

I don't dislike Danny Wilson; I was in favour of his appointment. But you judge people on results.\" After the poorest start to a season since the Premiership was formed in 1992 Wednesday are currently four points adrift at the foot of the table, having won two of their 20 league games. However, Wilson remains popular with a high percentage of his club's long-suffering support. Most criticism has been levelled at a board of directors which has overseen a fall from grace on the pitch and an almost unparalleled descent into debts estimated at \u00a315m. Last night the row even prompted a split within the Labour Party when Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader and arguably the club's most celebrated fan, insisted that Wilson should keep his job. \"It is not my view that he should be sacked,\" he said. \"I share the MPs' concern but I don't think he should go.\" Wilson declared himself to be more concerned with the timing of the MPs' comments rather than their message. \"I just think it is pathetic timing,\" he said. \"I would have thought people of their stature would have known better. If they want to keep blasting their mouths off, I can't do anything about that. I've got broad shoulders.\" This afternoon Wednesday play host to their fellow-strugglers Bradford City, a match which could well shape their destiny. While the dismissal of the 40-year-old Wilson has, for several weeks, been regarded as an inevitability rather than a mere possibility, the beleaguered Wednesday board of directors handed him a third vote of confidence in two months yesterday. \"I am staggered and saddened to learn of the MPs' brutal attack on Danny Wilson and their call for him to be sacked,\" said the Wednesday secretary Alan Sykes, speaking on behalf of the club's directors. \"This shows a total lack of respect for Sheffield Wednesday and for everyone involved with the club.\" The chairman Dave Richards said: \"My initial reaction is to tell them to get on with the business of politics while we get on with the business of football.\" Ashton's final stand Letter from Joe Ashton MP to Alan Sykes, Secretary, Sheffield Wednesday FC Dear Alan, Further to our telephone conversation this morning I am formally, by fax, submitting to you my resignation as a vice-president of Sheffield Wednesday. Having been a season-ticket holder for 40 years and a shareholder for 25 years, it is something I do with great regret, especially following the newspaper revelations of a private meeting four Sheffield-area MPs had at the Charterhouse Bank in the City of London yesterday. However, as you know following the heated exchanges I had with the chairman at Stamford Bridge and Villa Park and other games recently, I can no longer support the board in its current policies, either financial or football. Following the 8-0 defeat at Newcastle I told several members of the board that drastic action was necessary to stay in the Premier League and I have continued to say so ever since. Unfortunately no sign of any action was forthcoming. Consequently, it is better if I return to the terraces where I came from and where I can express my opinions in an open way in a genuine debate on the future of Sheffield Wednesday. I hope you will communicate this letter to the board of directors. Yours sincerely, Joe Ashton MP",

Okay, so its very readability makes it suspect; so does the fact that Joan Brady is the kind of female novelist whom male critics like (she was the first woman to win the Whitbread outright); and so, in this novel, does her subject matter. </p> <p>Which here is the pianist Nikolas Strakhan, the wild and amoral son of a Russian nobleman. Nikolas steals first his musical gift from his piano teacher, then from his father.

It should also be added that everywhere he goes he sweeps women right off their feet and onto their backs. </p> <p>It is intriguing that here, finally, after so many female characters who are nothing more than the walking wet dreams of their male inventors, we finally have a fantasy from the other side, and one, moreover, which isn't witlessly formulaic.

      "body": "<p><strong> No Logo</strong> by Naomi Klein 490pp, Flamingo, \u00a314.99 <br> </p> <p> Two years ago, in a cash-strapped state school in Evans, Georgia, someone came up with an adventurous fundraising notion. One day in late March, when spring was bright and rising across the American South, the school would hold an official Coke Day. All the pupils would wear Coca-Cola T-shirts. They would sit in seminars given by Coca-Cola executives. Afterwards, against the pines and blue sky, the teenagers would pose for photographs, in a formation that breezily spelled out their benefactor's logo. For these services to modern capitalism, the school would receive $500. </p> <p>Coke Day came. The corporation swamped the campus. Except for one tiny corner: a single student, one of the older ones called Mike Cameron, came to school in a Pepsi T-shirt. He was immediately suspended. \"I know it sounds bad,\" said the school principal afterwards. \"But we had the regional president here and people [from Coca-Cola] flew in from Atlanta to do us the honour . . .\". </p> <p>It is not recorded here whether the school ever got any money. But the twin themes of this sharp and very timely book - that business is growing ever more ambitious and ubiquitous, and so are the revolts against it - are illustrated with characteristic neatness. Naomi Klein, who is a 29-year-old Canadian journalist, wants, in summary, to explain to us critically how our current, market-driven world of multimedia mergers and malls and sponsors' tentacles came into being, and how, for those inclined, this frantic and unfeeling state of affairs might be challenged. And she intends to do all this at a brave moment - just when most writing about business has turned breathless and uncritical. Marx and Orwell at least managed to catch capitalism at unsteady moments; Klein has to compete with e-commerce and all-absorbing conglomerates and what seems like the longest boom for decades, perhaps even centuries. A quick glance at the spine of this book suggests the scale of her task: Klein's publisher is owned by Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>Sensibly, she does not attempt straight polemic. Instead, the book begins obliquely, almost like a memoir, with a lingering gaze out of the windows of her Toronto apartment. Klein describes the old brick warehouses, the faded commercial murals, the \"smokestacks holding their breath\" across the city's former garment-making district. She lets a little nostalgia for the industrial past, for the stable jobs and striving immigrants and labour struggles, soften her focus. She depicts her own building, owned by an old local coatmaker, full of writers and artists, untouched by the area's encroaching gentrification, as a kind of oasis, a hold-out against the new billboards and apartment blocks crowding round. And then, just as your objections start to form, Klein's gaze suddenly hardens. Her little local utopia, she reveals, is built on cheap labour: her landlord began taking tenants when he moved his coat production to Indonesia. </p> <p>This book is a vast mesh of such connections. In Canada and America and Britain, using corporate histories and her own investigations and sly interviews with company directors, Klein draws a picture of unprecedented materialism. She meets a seven-year-old boy who marks his homework with Nike symbols instead of ticks. She cites the successful teenage TV show Dawson's Creek, which is sponsored by the clothing range J. Crew, where characters appear in nautical settings just like the brand's advertisements, and say lines such as \"He looks like he stepped out of a J. Crew catalog\". She examines the conversion of Michael Jordan, the former basketball star, into a celebrity endorser of sports goods; he is now so powerful that he, in turn, has his own \"JORDAN\" brand, and a chain of \"retail concept shops\", and receives commercial endorsements from other retired sportsmen. </p> <p>A couple of chapters in, your mind is already reeling. Klein can write - she favours informality and crispness over jargon, and her asides can be droll (\"The eternal urge for escape has never enjoyed such niche marketing\"). But, like many North American journalists, she does sometimes pile up her facts like skyscrapers. There are graphs here, and pie charts, and relentless climbing lines showing store numbers at Wal-Mart and revenues at Starbuck's. At first, this book feels a bit like Backlash , Susan Faludi's vast study of the reaction against feminism: convincing, and necessary, yet so dense with evidence and thought that the sheer effort and authorial ambition make more of an impression than the arguments. </p> <p>These, once extracted from all the bustle, are quite clear and fresh. The most publicly successful modern businesses, Klein writes, are those that have abandoned making things in favour of making images. Clothing empires like Nike and Tommy Hilfiger are her purest examples: by having all their manufacturing done abroad, in factories they do not own, but belong instead to near-anonymous sub-contractors and sub-sub-contractors, such conglomerates can save hugely on labour costs. Yet, more importantly perhaps, this arrangement - which selling over the internet will most likely consolidate - leaves these companies free to concentrate on more pleasant and undefined tasks, like \"building the brand\", and dreaming up idealistic slogans, and thinking of new products to put their logo on, between cups of coffee, as the air-conditioning murmurs. </p> <p>And while headquarters, and the rest of these corporations' employees in the rich world, approach business as a sort of conceptual game - the dream, perhaps, of capitalists down the ages -their distant grey sheds in the Far East and Central America offer work boiled down to a sort of brutal essence. Halfway through the book, Klein makes a trip to the Cavite Export Processing Zone in the Philippines. </p> <p>Her reportage is calm but unsparing. Outside the walls and checkpoints of the factory compound, she notes the noise and decay and overcrowding of the surrounding town. Inside, she slips between windowless, identical halls, piled high with training shoes, entirely unmarked by the names of the companies being supplied. In such closed-off places across the world, where taxes and unions and regulations and the attentions of local politicians barely reach at all, 27 million people are currently at work, estimates the International Labour Organization. In Cavite, Klein meets some of them; in their workplaces, they undramatically tell her, the ventilation is so poor that the night-time condensation gives them pneumonia. </p> <p>Klein holds her temper. Her style is more Noam Chomsky than John Pilger: she condemns by quotation and accumulation, not finger-pointing. What is more, she devotes substantial sections here to the shortcomings of the Left in the face of this new economic order. She is particularly scolding about Political Correctness and the identity-fixated leftwing politics of the Eighties and early Nineties. She and many others were too busy \"fighting about women's studies and the latest backlash book\", she says, to notice the advertisements going up inside toilet cubicles, the professors growing cripplingly deferential towards research-funding corporations, the whole stealthy creep of private-sector influence into what had once been the public realm. </p> <p>Even worse - and this is a bitterly perceptive insight - identity politics ultimately aided the conglomerates. Ethnic and gender categories, long fought for, were almost instantly converted into target markets during the mid-Nineties. Watch MTV or go to Benetton; their diversity of musicians and models, which once seemed pretty admirable, now looks like nothing more than globalised sales talk. </p> <p>In the last third of the book, Klein looks for more genuine resistance to the dominant money-making order. She uncovers billboard vandals, subversive customisers of advertisements, internet-linked activists of every leftish persuasion. Some seem cartoonish: like Agent Blueberry of the Biotic Baking Brigade, who specialises in throwing pies at tycoons and economists (\"To their lies, we respond with pies\"). Others appear as smoothly international as their targets: Klein quotes dispatches from Reclaim The Streets, the impromptu barricaders of traffic-choked cities, sent out from actions in Tel Aviv and Darwin. </p> <p>Such diverse forces, she argues, are beginning to turn the power of the corporations back on themselves. The more that Shell, say, widens its operations and seeks to fix its brand in the world's consciousness, the more it becomes vulnerable to criticisms and revelations, from any of its far-flung territories, which can loom like chilly shadows behind its every bright billboard and logo. The wall of euphemism between the grey sheds and the grand corporate mission statements can be more and more damagingly breached. Klein excitedly lists - her usual distance disappearing somewhat - all the recently-publicised embarrassments: Shell's forced retreat from sinking the Brent Spar oil platform at sea; the squall over the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the activist who opposed Shell's oil extraction in Nigeria; and \"Nike's sweatshop scandals\", which \"have been the subject of over 1,500 news articles and opinion columns\". </p> <p>The trouble is, most people seem to keep buying such companies' products regardless.

      "bodyText": "No Logo by Naomi Klein 490pp, Flamingo, \u00a314.99 Two years ago, in a cash-strapped state school in Evans, Georgia, someone came up with an adventurous fundraising notion. One day in late March, when spring was bright and rising across the American South, the school would hold an official Coke Day. All the pupils would wear Coca-Cola T-shirts. They would sit in seminars given by Coca-Cola executives. Afterwards, against the pines and blue sky, the teenagers would pose for photographs, in a formation that breezily spelled out their benefactor's logo. For these services to modern capitalism, the school would receive $500. Coke Day came. The corporation swamped the campus. Except for one tiny corner: a single student, one of the older ones called Mike Cameron, came to school in a Pepsi T-shirt. He was immediately suspended. \"I know it sounds bad,\" said the school principal afterwards. \"But we had the regional president here and people [from Coca-Cola] flew in from Atlanta to do us the honour . . .\". It is not recorded here whether the school ever got any money. But the twin themes of this sharp and very timely book - that business is growing ever more ambitious and ubiquitous, and so are the revolts against it - are illustrated with characteristic neatness. Naomi Klein, who is a 29-year-old Canadian journalist, wants, in summary, to explain to us critically how our current, market-driven world of multimedia mergers and malls and sponsors' tentacles came into being, and how, for those inclined, this frantic and unfeeling state of affairs might be challenged. And she intends to do all this at a brave moment - just when most writing about business has turned breathless and uncritical. Marx and Orwell at least managed to catch capitalism at unsteady moments; Klein has to compete with e-commerce and all-absorbing conglomerates and what seems like the longest boom for decades, perhaps even centuries. A quick glance at the spine of this book suggests the scale of her task: Klein's publisher is owned by Rupert Murdoch. Sensibly, she does not attempt straight polemic. Instead, the book begins obliquely, almost like a memoir, with a lingering gaze out of the windows of her Toronto apartment. Klein describes the old brick warehouses, the faded commercial murals, the \"smokestacks holding their breath\" across the city's former garment-making district. She lets a little nostalgia for the industrial past, for the stable jobs and striving immigrants and labour struggles, soften her focus. She depicts her own building, owned by an old local coatmaker, full of writers and artists, untouched by the area's encroaching gentrification, as a kind of oasis, a hold-out against the new billboards and apartment blocks crowding round. And then, just as your objections start to form, Klein's gaze suddenly hardens. Her little local utopia, she reveals, is built on cheap labour: her landlord began taking tenants when he moved his coat production to Indonesia. This book is a vast mesh of such connections. In Canada and America and Britain, using corporate histories and her own investigations and sly interviews with company directors, Klein draws a picture of unprecedented materialism. She meets a seven-year-old boy who marks his homework with Nike symbols instead of ticks. She cites the successful teenage TV show Dawson's Creek, which is sponsored by the clothing range J. Crew, where characters appear in nautical settings just like the brand's advertisements, and say lines such as \"He looks like he stepped out of a J. Crew catalog\". She examines the conversion of Michael Jordan, the former basketball star, into a celebrity endorser of sports goods; he is now so powerful that he, in turn, has his own \"JORDAN\" brand, and a chain of \"retail concept shops\", and receives commercial endorsements from other retired sportsmen. A couple of chapters in, your mind is already reeling. Klein can write - she favours informality and crispness over jargon, and her asides can be droll (\"The eternal urge for escape has never enjoyed such niche marketing\"). But, like many North American journalists, she does sometimes pile up her facts like skyscrapers. There are graphs here, and pie charts, and relentless climbing lines showing store numbers at Wal-Mart and revenues at Starbuck's. At first, this book feels a bit like Backlash , Susan Faludi's vast study of the reaction against feminism: convincing, and necessary, yet so dense with evidence and thought that the sheer effort and authorial ambition make more of an impression than the arguments. These, once extracted from all the bustle, are quite clear and fresh. The most publicly successful modern businesses, Klein writes, are those that have abandoned making things in favour of making images. Clothing empires like Nike and Tommy Hilfiger are her purest examples: by having all their manufacturing done abroad, in factories they do not own, but belong instead to near-anonymous sub-contractors and sub-sub-contractors, such conglomerates can save hugely on labour costs. Yet, more importantly perhaps, this arrangement - which selling over the internet will most likely consolidate - leaves these companies free to concentrate on more pleasant and undefined tasks, like \"building the brand\", and dreaming up idealistic slogans, and thinking of new products to put their logo on, between cups of coffee, as the air-conditioning murmurs. And while headquarters, and the rest of these corporations' employees in the rich world, approach business as a sort of conceptual game - the dream, perhaps, of capitalists down the ages -their distant grey sheds in the Far East and Central America offer work boiled down to a sort of brutal essence. Halfway through the book, Klein makes a trip to the Cavite Export Processing Zone in the Philippines. Her reportage is calm but unsparing. Outside the walls and checkpoints of the factory compound, she notes the noise and decay and overcrowding of the surrounding town. Inside, she slips between windowless, identical halls, piled high with training shoes, entirely unmarked by the names of the companies being supplied. In such closed-off places across the world, where taxes and unions and regulations and the attentions of local politicians barely reach at all, 27 million people are currently at work, estimates the International Labour Organization. In Cavite, Klein meets some of them; in their workplaces, they undramatically tell her, the ventilation is so poor that the night-time condensation gives them pneumonia. Klein holds her temper. Her style is more Noam Chomsky than John Pilger: she condemns by quotation and accumulation, not finger-pointing. What is more, she devotes substantial sections here to the shortcomings of the Left in the face of this new economic order. She is particularly scolding about Political Correctness and the identity-fixated leftwing politics of the Eighties and early Nineties. She and many others were too busy \"fighting about women's studies and the latest backlash book\", she says, to notice the advertisements going up inside toilet cubicles, the professors growing cripplingly deferential towards research-funding corporations, the whole stealthy creep of private-sector influence into what had once been the public realm. Even worse - and this is a bitterly perceptive insight - identity politics ultimately aided the conglomerates. Ethnic and gender categories, long fought for, were almost instantly converted into target markets during the mid-Nineties. Watch MTV or go to Benetton; their diversity of musicians and models, which once seemed pretty admirable, now looks like nothing more than globalised sales talk. In the last third of the book, Klein looks for more genuine resistance to the dominant money-making order. She uncovers billboard vandals, subversive customisers of advertisements, internet-linked activists of every leftish persuasion. Some seem cartoonish: like Agent Blueberry of the Biotic Baking Brigade, who specialises in throwing pies at tycoons and economists (\"To their lies, we respond with pies\"). Others appear as smoothly international as their targets: Klein quotes dispatches from Reclaim The Streets, the impromptu barricaders of traffic-choked cities, sent out from actions in Tel Aviv and Darwin. Such diverse forces, she argues, are beginning to turn the power of the corporations back on themselves. The more that Shell, say, widens its operations and seeks to fix its brand in the world's consciousness, the more it becomes vulnerable to criticisms and revelations, from any of its far-flung territories, which can loom like chilly shadows behind its every bright billboard and logo. The wall of euphemism between the grey sheds and the grand corporate mission statements can be more and more damagingly breached. Klein excitedly lists - her usual distance disappearing somewhat - all the recently-publicised embarrassments: Shell's forced retreat from sinking the Brent Spar oil platform at sea; the squall over the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the activist who opposed Shell's oil extraction in Nigeria; and \"Nike's sweatshop scandals\", which \"have been the subject of over 1,500 news articles and opinion columns\". The trouble is, most people seem to keep buying such companies' products regardless. They may hear about these cruelties, they may disapprove of them, but, with a pragmatism perhaps related to Klein's preparedness to publish with Murdoch, they may feel in the end that they have little choice. Her suggested counters to this vicious circle, which range from \"raising the bar\" for corporate standards by better regulation to \"building a resistance\" through public stunts and the internet, feel slightly automatic. Maybe the value of this book lies more in its diagnosis than its cures. There aren't too many perfect formulas for social justice in Orwell, either.",

In 1780, the future hero of Trafalgar gathered his forces and set off to conquer the country. It did not go well. One of his men was taken by a jaguar, another bitten on the face by a tree-snake. \" 'He was found dead,' Nelson's physician recorded, 'with all the symptoms of putrefaction; a yellowness of body; and the eye, near to which he was bitten, all dissolved.' \" </p> <p>For mestizos - Nicaraguans of mixed Spanish and Native American extraction - Nelson is just one of the pirates, and the failure of his expedition (only eight out of an original 200 survived), a source of national pride. The Spanish garrison was eventually able to stroll back into the citadel unhindered - the same one in which, two centuries later, the Sandinistas kept captured Contra guerrillas. It is in such links that Marriott's approach excels: as the manicured lawns of El Castillo today give up the rough secrets of the past, you realise how how much the travel writer has learned from the historian. </p> <p>Northeast of El Castillo, on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, lies the starting-point for Marriott's journey proper: the rusty town of Bluefields. Settled by British pirates in the 1630s, it has ever since been a melting pot for Creole, Black Carib and mestizo culture. From there, after a spell with dugout fishermen on the ocean, he undertakes a Heart of Darkness-style journey to the interior: on a coconut barge up the San Juan river to Lake Nicaragua. Marriott hopes (though the narrative hook is not so very barbed as to be off putting) to track the passage of Carcharhinus leucas, the bull-shark. </p> <p>This \"most wilful and aggressive of tropical sharks\", hunted on an industrial scale during the Somoza dictatorship, is Marriott's ostensible quarry. Like all such subjects (cf Samantha Weinberg's recent book about the coelacanth), it has the requisite ecological peculiarity: \"Like no other shark, it possessed the ability to cross from salt- to freshwater, hunting far upriver to the lake beyond, cruising the coast, the bar mouth and the San Juan's brackish lower stretches.\" </p> <p>And, for local inhabitants, totemic value. \"The coastal and river people hunted the shark for its fins and for its oil, feared it and revered it; every village had had family taken in its jaws. It was shark where shark should not be - in freshwater, on human territory.\" </p> <p>In fact, the question of territory is the theme that runs throughout this exciting, but thoughtful book, giving it coherence and allowing Marriott to associate - though always with judgment and perspective - depredations of varying orders: the imperialists and pirates of old, Cold War support for both Sandinistas and Contras, the brutal lives of ordinary people today, and (not least) the ever diminishing stock of bull-sharks, preyed on by fishermen and pesticides alike.</p>",

One of his men was taken by a jaguar, another bitten on the face by a tree-snake. \" 'He was found dead,' Nelson's physician recorded, 'with all the symptoms of putrefaction; a yellowness of body; and the eye, near to which he was bitten, all dissolved.' \" For mestizos - Nicaraguans of mixed Spanish and Native American extraction - Nelson is just one of the pirates, and the failure of his expedition (only eight out of an original 200 survived), a source of national pride. The Spanish garrison was eventually able to stroll back into the citadel unhindered - the same one in which, two centuries later, the Sandinistas kept captured Contra guerrillas. It is in such links that Marriott's approach excels: as the manicured lawns of El Castillo today give up the rough secrets of the past, you realise how how much the travel writer has learned from the historian. Northeast of El Castillo, on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, lies the starting-point for Marriott's journey proper: the rusty town of Bluefields. Settled by British pirates in the 1630s, it has ever since been a melting pot for Creole, Black Carib and mestizo culture. From there, after a spell with dugout fishermen on the ocean, he undertakes a Heart of Darkness-style journey to the interior: on a coconut barge up the San Juan river to Lake Nicaragua. Marriott hopes (though the narrative hook is not so very barbed as to be off putting) to track the passage of Carcharhinus leucas, the bull-shark. This \"most wilful and aggressive of tropical sharks\", hunted on an industrial scale during the Somoza dictatorship, is Marriott's ostensible quarry. Like all such subjects (cf Samantha Weinberg's recent book about the coelacanth), it has the requisite ecological peculiarity: \"Like no other shark, it possessed the ability to cross from salt- to freshwater, hunting far upriver to the lake beyond, cruising the coast, the bar mouth and the San Juan's brackish lower stretches.\" And, for local inhabitants, totemic value. \"The coastal and river people hunted the shark for its fins and for its oil, feared it and revered it; every village had had family taken in its jaws. It was shark where shark should not be - in freshwater, on human territory.\" In fact, the question of territory is the theme that runs throughout this exciting, but thoughtful book, giving it coherence and allowing Marriott to associate - though always with judgment and perspective - depredations of varying orders: the imperialists and pirates of old, Cold War support for both Sandinistas and Contras, the brutal lives of ordinary people today, and (not least) the ever diminishing stock of bull-sharks, preyed on by fishermen and pesticides alike.",

It is not that they are longer than anyone else's, nor that they are epics covering eras and epochs. They are bigger in format; wider, taller books. This is to accommodate a far longer line than most poets employ; a Whitmanesque line that Williams has made very much his own.</p> <p>In these extended, apparently discursive lines, he has the elbow-room to try out this word or that, and then sometimes reject both for another; he has the space to take an impression and then revise it, or to describe a reassessment, whether contemporaneous or retrospective, of an event or emotion. The work of this 63-year-old American, who lives in Paris when he is not teaching creative writing at Princeton, is almost an enactment of Wallace Stevens's idea of \"the poem of the mind in the act of finding / what will suffice\". </p> <p>He has been published in this country by the Northern publisher Bloodaxe, who have not only had the good judgment to take on his work, but the diligence to present it properly. His latest volume, Repair, is one of ten collections short-listed for the prestigious T S Eliot Prize, and must be a strong contender. Meditating on hurt and loss, both personal and political or historical, the volume finds ways towards reconciliation, recovery, healing. </p> <p>The opening poem recalls the experience of taking an ice pick (of the domestic variety) to a large block of ice, and its images of fissuring and splintering run through the volume. The memory is real, dating back to a job Williams had as a boy, but by the time the poet has himself finished chipping and tapping at it, it might stand for the act of memory, or the divided self, or even his own poetic process: \"Imagine how even if it shattered and began to liquefy / the hope would still remain that if you quickly gathered up the slithery, perversely skittish chips, / they might be refrozen and the mass reconstitute, with precious little of its brilliance lost, / just this lucent shimmer on the rough raised grain of the water-rotten floor, / just this single drop, as sweet and warm as blood, evaporating on your tongue.\" </p> <p>What Williams does, in his apparently langorous yet tensely focused poems, is to enact processes as much as he describes them. Repair, as much as any of the work he has produced, is about the excavation of memories, the stripping down of his subjects to approach the essence of an event or an emotion, and in doing so to build on it and benefit from it.</p> <p>\"House\" is almost like a Rachel Whiteread sculpture in its description of this endeavour, with a building as a metaphor for the constructed self, and its tenderness towards the conflicting demands of that self: \"Down under all to the ancient errors, indolence, envy, pretension, the frailties as though in the gene; / down to where consciousness cries 'Make me new', but pleads as pitiably 'Cherish me as I was.' \" </p> <p>Some of the poems in Repair deal with very old wounds indeed, such as \"After Auschwitz\" (much of the finished volume was written during a seven-month stay in Germany). As Williams remarked when I interviewed him, \"you can't be a Jew in the 20th century without what happened being part of your intimate experience\". </p> <p>His Jewishness is mentioned in the other big political poem of the volume, \"King\", about Martin Luther King's funeral, and the harassment by the police of a black friend who was on his way to meet Williams that day: the racial divide had become unbridgeable, and the poem contains the terse reported line, \"And please, please don't tell me again you can understand because you're a Jew.\"</p> <p>The poem has taken thirty years to write faithfully, and is a sad piece because it suggests that resolution of the race problem in America has not been reached in the intervening years. \"Isn't that what we're supposed to do in our country; / aren't we given to believe our wounds will heal, our scars fade, our insults be redeemed?\" Williams asks, impotently in the poem. Yet, as he tells me, \"things have moved on, but race still matters; things haven't been resolved as much as we assumed they would be by now, when we were in the 1960s and passionately believed we were 'on the way'. In some ways, we've learned that things can get worse.\" </p> <p>Repair is a spiritual book, though not a religious one. Williams left Judaism \"the day after my Bar Mitzvah\", losing \"not just a religion but a community\". He wrestled with the question of what a relationship with God might be for years afterwards. \"It's only recently that I was willing to take on the identity of an atheist,\" he remarks. \"Before I was a shilly-shallying agnostic. Maybe this is part of my release into something else.\" Interestingly, the poet he was reading most while writing Repair was George Herbert, who was unparalleled as a poet of religious doubt until Hopkins and Geoffrey Hill. </p> <p>Herbert's influence is discernible at times, in the restless tussling of the poetry; but the two poets agonise to very different theological conclusions. \"Herbert's is relentless. He's really the hardest person on himself who ever lived,\" Williams remarks, charmingly unaware that he is also hard on himself - rigorous, scrupulous, moral. </p> <p>He is not as austere as that description suggests, however. Passionate, engaged, alert, always watching people, he is as attuned to joy, amusement and love as he is to undercurrents of pain, or the tragedies and comedies of shame and embarrassment. There's even an epiphanic little poem about farting near the end.</p> <p><strong> Autobiography of Red</strong><br>Anne Carson<br>Cape, \u00a310<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502233509,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Certainly the oddest book on the shortlist, Autobiography of Red concerns Geryon, a monster with red wings, written about by the poet Stesichoros (who slandered Helen of Troy, and was blinded by the Gods until he composed a palinode, or retraction).

This hefty volume is part diary and part a collection of postcards, letters and mad telegrams. Subjects range from the Catholic missions to the poor of Brazil to Ireland under Mary Robinson to the Troubles. His extended piece on the Omagh bombing combines vituperation for the IRA in the wake of Gerry Adams's first ever condemnation of a bombing; litanies to the dead, and gestures to the life that continues. Its agonised refusal to forgive is wrought from a dignified anger which is properly moving. </p> <p> <strong>Billy's Rain</strong><br>Hugo Williams<br>Faber, \u00a37.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501838652,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Hugo Williams's latest volume is an account of an extramarital affair, though many of the pieces could be about any relationship's excitements, obsessions and dismays. Williams has never demonstrated breathtaking breadth of technique or linguistic resource; what he does best, in his columns and poems, is to offer anecdotes with a little style and a lot of charm.</p> <p>He is a lyric poet, and there are moments in Billy's Rain where a recognisable feeling or event is encapsulated with wit and economy: \"checking my smile / in the mirror in the hall / against my chances of being liked\". Over a whole volume, though, the limitations of the one-club golfer are exposed. Williams's wife apparently read Billy's Rain and remarked \"Five years' work then?\", which, as practical criticism goes, is also witty and economical. </p> <p><strong>The Wind Dog</strong><br>Tom Paulin<br>Faber, \u00a37.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502321554,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> A strange, experimental volume, wrestling with the author's childhood and the relationship between nationalism and language. Paulin's political hobbyhorses and favourite paintings get the treatment in a jazzy, slangy style with a deliberately unfinished feel to it. The fruits of Paulin's academic career are evident in every allusion, and his combative critical approach informs many of his little battles over language, literature and the unappealing politics of great writers in this ambitious and flawed collection. </p> <p><strong> Jizzen</strong><br>Kathleen Jamie<br>Bloodaxe, \u00a36.99<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501002624,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Jizzen is an old Scots word for childbed. In this collection, Jamie welcomes her country's newfound independence and the birth of her child. In a precise, vivacious language, whether English or phonetic Scots, she writes an intense and celebratory poetry with good humour, a lightness of touch, and a sense of music and economy; the poems about childbirth are delicious, being both sharply physical, and warmly spiritual.

This may be the translation's fault, in which case I apologise, but few things in life are as irritating as sentences like: \"Her voice has a dark resonance to it, a kind of music, a merry promise of good things to come\". Do you know someone with a voice like that? </p> <p>Meanwhile Colgan does funny as hard as she can. She doesn't worry about transcending anything, or de-familiarising us, or tuning into universal themes. She just produces lines like \"You see, I'm keeping my name and taking his name.

      "body": "<p><strong> Country of My Skull</strong> by Antjie Krog 464pp, Vintage, \u00a37.99 <br> </p> <p> Antjie Krog is a poet and a journalist, a combination that underscores Country of My Skull , her horrifying and compelling account of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In the book, Krog the poet articulates visceral emotions, recreates the moment, puts images together in an original, iconoclastic way. Krog the journalist, who spent two years at TRC hearings reporting for South African radio, records testimonies verbatim and provides the broader context. </p> <p>Krog, an Afrikaner, was asked to write Country of My Skull on the strength of an article she had produced about the TRC for a South African newspaper. \"The response to the article,\" says Krog, \"was overwhelming. It was in the Christmas edition after a year of the TRC hearings. I put in the incongruity of celebrating Christmas on the one hand and the TRC on the other.\" </p> <p>This apparent incongruity, the poetic licence within the journalist's prose, is integral to the subsequent book's power. \"I realised that 'flat reporting' of facts made it hard for readers to find an entry point into the process,\" she says, and so she decided to introduce herself - \"I\" - into the narrative, that person journalists are supposed to leave at home. \"I brought in the personal 'I' on which the reader could piggyback into the hearing. When it was too much for the reader, it was also too much for me - then I would ask myself why can't I go on, finding words for the reader and myself to deal with the horror.\" In her radio journalism Krog never used the \"I\". \"As a journalist I worked under my married surname, Samuel, deliberately to separate the poet from the journalist. The act of creativity is in essence to disobey, to undermine. The act of reporting as a journalist is to carry out your duty, to report as best you can to keep listeners (in my case for radio) informed to make their own informed choices.\" </p> <p>The dutiful journalist collected the material, the disobedient poet wrote it. \"The idea of objectivity or neutrality is laughable - one can only be fair or give as many sides to a story as are available. Poetry is subjective. When I wrote the book, it was no longer necessary to split the two. The book was not to be a report of the TRC - it was my own journey through a process.\" </p> <p>The result, according to one critic, was \"one of the most remarkable books to come out of South Africa\". It was \"a major, lasting work of non-fiction,\" wrote another. But one influential critic, RW Johnson, went for the jugular: \"Krog is no sort of journalist at all and her emotional stream of consciousness style is innocent of all notions of factual reporting, balance , evidence or even handed reporting. . . like most white lefties, [Krog] is so paralysed by guilt she can't say boo to a goose if it's black.\" Krog, like any writer, finds negative criticism hard to take but divides it into \"negative criticism which pulls you out of a something you are trapped in, and hurts but helps,\" and the other sort - \"the negative criticism which deliberately distorts your work to assist in a private agenda\". RW Johnson's fell into the latter category. \"He made factual mistakes such as that the TRC requested that I be appointed as reporter because I'm an ANC lackey. If he read the book at all he would have seen that I was appointed long before the TRC - in fact I reported on the prospective candidates. He advises readers how to pronounce my name - and then does it incorrectly. He has the right-wing liberal kind of image that he has to uphold and nothing irritates that kind more than Afrikaners who maybe like to live in the new South Africa and feel responsible for the past.\" </p> <p>Krog's use of fictional devices may have irritated Johnson but others applauded the device of amalgamating different people's perceptions to create composite truths. \"The testimonies weren't changed at all, nor my interviews with the people whose real names I use. The composite stories deal with fictitious people. Some of those I call my colleagues do not exist, their words are a combination of a variety of arguments I picked up around me. Instead for instance of having a long rambling solo on guilt, I have a conversation with a lover. I have three brothers, not two. I initially did that in an effort not to censure myself right from the beginning - thinking my brother, neighbour, colleague or friend will be furious about this, or I will have to consult with people and find out whether they are OK with this.\" </p> <p>Krog wrote the book in three months. \"I took unpaid leave - that was all I could afford. I drew up a tight schedule of chapters and worked out the precise amount of words I had to do per day. The latter chapters happened over weekends and at nights after a ten- to twelve- hour workday.\" </p> <p>How did Krog fit such long, hard, working days around her four children's lives - all were under 21 at the time, the youngest still at school. \"I sat down at 8.15 every day, broke for tea 10.30 to 11am, sat in the sun just melting. Worked until two and child gets home. Lunch with him, lie down and discuss homework, check things. Start working again at 3.30 until five when husband comes home. Cook. Go back at nine and work out the content of the next day so that the subconscious could start working.\" As Krog reported on the hearings during the TRC years, her husband learned to cook - \"and he gave two 21st birthday parties at home, because I wasn't here. But my absence took a big toll from him and the youngest child.\" </p> <p>Krog is now working on a volume of poetry and that, she says is a \"totally different kind of discipline - it is actually not a discipline but a full time effort to create space and silence in your head to hear.\"</p>",

And 10 wickets are all he needs to reach the magical 300, a landmark he has set his heart on.</p> <p>He would have loved bowling at Centurion Park. Instead he spent much of the first day in earnest conversation with Dr Ali Bacher to determine the direction of his cricketing future. Donald had promised Warwickshire, whose coach, Bob Woolmer, is now ever-present in South African press boxes rather than their dressing rooms, that he would reveal his future plans during this Test. Yesterday he sat alongside Dr Bacher and announced that he would take a break from international cricket, missing South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka in June. He is, however, available for the triangular one-day series that begins this week. He hoped to resume his Test career in the 2000/01 season in South Africa when New Zealand and Sri Lanka are the visitors.</p> <p>The equation was a tricky one for all concerned; it's also one that will become increasingly prevalent as the international calendar becomes ever more congested. Donald's case is especially complicated. He knows that at 33 there is, as Graham Gooch used to say, 'not much petrol left in the tank'. Donald, unlike Dennis Lillee in his dotage, has to bowl fast to be effective. The body - even before the onset of gout - is beginning to rebel and the heart is not quite so willing. Donald is more sensitive than our caricature of a fast bowler. For him Test cricket saps the mind as well as the body.</p> <p>Yet he is desperate for that 300. On the surface this might appear a selfish pursuit born of vanity. But anyone who has seen Donald play cricket over the past decade would dismiss that theory immediately. The manner in which he has hurled himself at the Englishmen in this series is sufficient evidence. Donald has been the man to take the vital, match-winning wickets, sometimes, as in Cape Town, on unresponsive pitches. By sheer force of personality he has willed the most experienced of Englishmen, Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart, into fatal indiscretions. By winding them up and straining every sinew for the extra zip in that bouncer, he has dispatched them.</p> <p>Donald, like Richard Hadlee, is conscious of the statistics, but he uses them as motivation, to will himself on even when the body's aching, even when his rhythm has been elusive, which has often been the case in this series. Yet he still snaffled 22 wickets in four Tests.</p> <p>However, there are other concerns beyond the 300. If the 300 was all pervasive in Donald's mind he would definitely be touring India with the South Africans this February. Dr Bacher has asked him to consider making himself available for the two Tests in Mumbai and Bangalore but 'there's no pressure on him'. Donald will dutifully consider that proposition when he returns to Bloemfontein this week but it remains highly unlikely that he will go. He's had enough for the moment.</p> <p>Donald is devoted to his adopted county Warwickshire and, it should be noted, he's well paid by them as well. Warwickshire had made two demands of Donald before offering him another one-year contract: that he should be fit to start the county season and that he should be available throughout. To satisfy them Donald feels a need to rest while his compatriots are in India and he therefore had to withdraw from South Africa's commitments in Australia and in Sri Lanka next summer as well.</p> <p>There is one other factor. Donald's daughter is due to start school in Birmingham this spring and he wants to be around when that happens. Like most international cricketers he is in danger of missing out on his children's formative years. Hence the compromise hatched with Dr Bacher. So he will be back with Warwickshire this summer and compared to with the demands of the international calendar this represents something of a holiday. 'I can relax more there and I know that Bob [Woolmer] will use me sparingly,' he said. All being well he has the chance to notch his 300th Test wicket when New Zealand tour South Africa in the autumn of this year.</p> <p>Donald is not alone among the South Africans in seeking some respite. Jonty Rhodes has pulled out of the Indian tour so that he can be present when his wife gives birth, and on Friday Darryl Cullinan announced that he would no longer play one-day cricket at international or domestic level. Although Cullinan put forward the noble idea that his absence would allow an opportunity to groom one of their youngsters for the 2003 World Cup (the South Africans are aiming to have a squad who have all played 50 one-day internationals by the time the next World Cup comes around), Cullinan also conceded that family pressures were uppermost in his mind. He added that he hoped this decision might prolong his Test career.</p> <p>The South Africans, under the omnipotent guidance of Ali Bacher, are in the throes of the most punishing of schedules and are fraying at the edges - you only have to watch Hansie Cronje bat at the moment to recognise that. Bacher is asking a lot of his men - arguably too much - but at least he's been able to manage these setbacks adroitly. The announcements involving Donald and Cullinan, which might have been deemed disasters, have been deftly handled after long discussions between Bacher and the players involved. Compromises have been reached and 'positives' identified. Bacher was at pains to point out how 'flexible' the United Cricket Board had been and Donald duly expressed his gratitude. Contrast that with way in which Graham Thorpe's perfectly reasonable decision to withdraw from this tour came to pass - a hurried conversation with David Graveney prior to a Sunday paper 'exclusive'</p> <p>Administrators around the world have to be wary of the danger of burn-out. The pursuit of the extra dollar is liable to abbreviate more international careers. The side-effect this might have on county cricket is intriguing.

      "byline": "Decca Aitkenhead",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One of the first things you see when you arrive in Bangkok is a poster. \"Thailand\", it reads at the top, and underneath are four boxes showing weather forecast symbols and dates. 1997 shows a thunderstorm, 1998 heavy rain. By 1999, sun is peeping through the cloud. And the box for 2000 shows the beaming sun usually stuck over Malaga on a weather map. In big capitals along the bottom it reads simply: \"INVEST NOW!\" </p> <p>You barely notice the poster at first, too distracted by the exotic chaos of the city, the monks and the tuk-tuks and the temples and the smells you at first assume are the drains, and later realise are in fact the food. But by the time you leave, the poster has come to read more like the country's national mission statement. Travel agents and travellers love to coo about the mystical holiness of Thailand, but Thailand is actually much more interested in money, and will do almost anything to make it. And if Westerners were honest about it, that is precisely why they come here. </p> <p>For those of us who don't fully grasp global economic complexities, Bangkok is like an idiot's guide to the tiger economies. From a hotel balcony high above the city, it looks like a gleaming first-world forest of hi-tech skyscrapers, emblazoned in neon with the names of multinationals. Down at street level, the shiny hauteur gives way to an anarchy of dust and rubbish and food stalls and stinking slums - but the slums aren't sultry ponds of lifelessness, they're frenzies of industry. It is a bewilderment of enterprise - clothing sweat shops crammed in next to computer shops, then a jewellery emporium next door to a store selling safes - and the traffic is a judder of gridlock and mayhem, steered by drivers in face masks, cheeks smudged with oily pollution. </p> <p>Bangkok lies along a river, and from 6am this takes on the appearance of the M25. The water churns with boats ferrying the city to work, and office girls in short skirts, old women with groceries, young monks and startled tourists all leap as the vessels come careering on and off the landings, navigated by nothing more than a man on the bow whistling instructions to a driver who can't see a thing. There is a glorious and universal disregard for order - it is as if there are no rules as long as you're making money, and as if the entire city is on speed. </p> <p>Which isn't too far from the truth. Amphetamines are abundant in Thailand, as is political corruption; the latest scandal to emerge during our stay were photographs of the prime minister with one of the country's leading dealers in speed pills. If a spirit of enterprising lawlessness accounted for Thailand's manic growth before the tiger crash of 1997, it is making a more orderly recovery difficult, and the city is tangled in poverty and confusions of desires. You can't move for temples or monks, and devotion to the King is extravagantly traditional - but after a rush of first-world wealth, Bangkok's profit impulse is so strong you can almost taste it in the air. And to judge from the tipsy grins that spread across the tourists' faces as they pile off the planes, it rather looks as if they have. </p> <p>\"You've just got to be hard,\" the woman in the hotel foyer informed us through pinched lips. She'd arrived from Yorkshire with her husband that morning, and straight off they'd gone shopping. She showed off her fake Prada handbags with grim satisfaction, while her husband talked us through the details of their haggling strategy like an angler reliving how he landed a shark. They'd not slept yet, but they'd been straight to the market; other activities on their itinerary were to get suits hand made by one of Bangkok's million tailors, and to bag some cheap jewellery. They'd dropped by the King's Palace (\"very interesting\") but not stayed long; they'd like to have seen some temples, of course, but time was short, what with all the shopping to be done. </p> <p>They had also found time to have a look at Patpong, Bangkok's red light district, home of the internationally renowned ping-pong shows. If there is one thing even cheaper in Bangkok than a tailor-made suit, it's sex, and the streets around Patpong are clogged with tour buses depositing middle-aged tourists curious to go and see go-go girls eject ping-pong balls from their vaginas. It is an odd phenomenon. Thais may be in a state of some confusion about their morality, and their dual enthusiasms for Buddhism and vice may be puzzling. But Thais have nothing on the Western tourists who'd turn the telly over if EastEnders got too steamy back home, but who flock cheerfully to Patpong for a cocktail and a Kodak moment. </p> <p>To the north of Patpong and the grand tourist hotels lies the Khao San Road, where the backpackers of South East Asia congregate, and their numbers have swelled to such an extent now that the Khao San Road itself has become a kind of sightseeing attraction for tourists. What was a cheap and cheerful dusty strip of budget hotels has ballooned into a rowdy clamour of shops and bars servicing the backpacker economy. So there are rucksack stores and sarong trolleys and a thousand internet caf\u00e9s and travel agents and women braiding hair, and the travellers heading out of Thailand casually flaunt their tans and their confidence at the nervier, whiter new arrivals, who can soon be spotted anxiously buying up the traveller uniform of sarongs and sandals. </p> <p>They come from all over the world, and the conversations in the caf\u00e9s are all about how cheaply they're hoping they can live when they get south to the islands. Travellers like to consider themselves a different breed to tourists, but they are alike in at least one respect. The new backpack arrivals can't contain their excitement either, at the thought of how little money they're going to have to spend. </p> <p>And the Thais, of course, can't contain their excitement at how much money they're going to get out of all these Westerners. Until relatively recently, visitors to Thailand tended to be sex tourists or travellers, but the collapse of the Baht has encouraged everyone else in between to make their way here, and the impact of mass tourism on parts of the country has been sudden and dramatic. </p> <p>Less than a decade ago, the island of Koh Samui was a backpacker's private idyll of empty white sands and simple beach huts, undeveloped and largely unheard of in an average branch of Thomas Cook. If Bangkok was a mildly suggestive byword for vice, Koh Samui was the very opposite, but backpackers in beach huts are notoriously unextravagant, and it hasn't taken the island very long to refashion itself into a more lucrative commodity. If couples from Yorkshire will suspend their normal behaviour and pay money to see a ping-pong show, it can't have been hard for Koh Samui to work out what Western men would pay for a fortnight of tropical sexual favours. </p> <p>\"Hello, welcome! Where you from! Come, come!\" is the fetching shriek that follows every tourist who makes his way through Koh Samui's main resort, Chaweng. The strip that runs parallel to the coconut-lined beach is a concrete and neon row of bars, each one fronted by a collection of beautiful, nubile, glamourous young Thai women, all executing a convincing performance of uncontrollable romantic desire. \"Come, come!\" they beckon prettily, staying just the right side of insistence, thus ensuring that the effect is girlishly charming rather than sluttish. And come the men do, with faces full of wolfish delight at the joy of this amazing arrangement which lets them make believe that they are sexually appealing. </p> <p>The system is straightforward enough. Every bar and club in Chaweng, with a tiny handful of exceptions, employs \"bar girls\". If you call them prostitutes, everyone looks shocked and slightly offended. It is their job to entice customers to the bar, and the bar will pay them a small cut of the price of every drink the customer buys. The girls swoon charmingly over the men, who can grope and fondle them, sit them on their lap, and bore them to tears with conversation; wisely, the girls have come up with an inventive deterrent to the latter by playing endless games of Kerplunk with them instead. </p> <p>The men enjoy the happy fantasy that these women are not prostitutes at all. That said, of course, if any of the men would like to take a girl off and have sex with her, all he must do is pay the bar about \u00a34, and take her away. He then agrees a price with the girl for sex - but a more popular arrangement is not a one-off transaction but instead the beginning of what the men laughably refer to as a \"relationship\". For the duration of his holiday, the girl becomes his \"girlfriend\". </p> <p>And so Chaweng is a resort town full of largely fat and unattractive European men driving around on mopeds with beautiful young women on the back. They are not doing anything sordid, they will tell you, like paying a poor, third-world prostitute to have sex with them. They are having a relationship! They buy lots of things for their girlfriend, of course, and generously give her money \"for her family\", but it has nothing to do with money. And the men strut about, beaming like little boys at Christmas, effortlessly able to enjoy the delusion, and having the time of their lives. </p> <p>There are a lot of men in Koh Samui. An astonishing number, actually, and the ones too embarrassed to enter into the \"girlfriend\" pretence during the day generally find themselves able to suspend disbelief by 3am, after 14 pints, so the clubs are full of alluring freelance girls dancing hopefully. Their stamina is prodigious, and their smile never fades, although many of them are assisted by small pills which the Thais call Yabba, a kind of nuclear amphetamine which, if smoked in silver foil, will keep you going forever. </p> <p>There are other things to do on Koh Samui besides pay women for sex. There is elephant trekking, and diving, and there are waterfalls to visit, and temples to see, and all the bars show European football on TV, and the restaurants screen movies you can watch while you eat. If you didn't manage enough shopping in Bangkok, you can buy more fake designer watches and bags and clothes, and you can haggle to your heart's desire, bellowing and waving your arms about over a matter of 10 or 20 pence, and the Thais will accommodate all these activities smilingly. You can get so drunk you drive your moped smack into an old woman's kebab stall, and she will smile gracefully and wave it away as nothing as she inspects the damage. And you can do all of this at a cost so small, it makes you feel like a king. </p> <p>What you cannot do, of course, is ever know that a smile on Koh Samui is real. The smiles on the faces of the Western men mauling bar girls are real enough - but even if you never grope a bar girl, never invest in a \"girlfriend\", never crash your moped into an old woman, never scream at a shopkeeper over 20 pence, you would have to be supremely thoughtless or arrogant to assume that the Thai smiling at you is smiling because he or she likes you and not your traveller's cheques. </p> <p>People come to Thailand because it makes them feel rich - and, just like rich people, most of them behave badly. But, also like rich people, they can never trust the motives of others' friendliness. This doesn't appear to bother too many Westerners here, it must be said. But if you don't care to feel like a whore's client for a fortnight, you might come to find it bothers you a lot. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0345 222111), Qantas (0345 747767) and THAI (020 74999113) fly direct to Bangkok from London.

      "bodyText": "One of the first things you see when you arrive in Bangkok is a poster. \"Thailand\", it reads at the top, and underneath are four boxes showing weather forecast symbols and dates. 1997 shows a thunderstorm, 1998 heavy rain. By 1999, sun is peeping through the cloud. And the box for 2000 shows the beaming sun usually stuck over Malaga on a weather map. In big capitals along the bottom it reads simply: \"INVEST NOW!\" You barely notice the poster at first, too distracted by the exotic chaos of the city, the monks and the tuk-tuks and the temples and the smells you at first assume are the drains, and later realise are in fact the food. But by the time you leave, the poster has come to read more like the country's national mission statement. Travel agents and travellers love to coo about the mystical holiness of Thailand, but Thailand is actually much more interested in money, and will do almost anything to make it. And if Westerners were honest about it, that is precisely why they come here. For those of us who don't fully grasp global economic complexities, Bangkok is like an idiot's guide to the tiger economies. From a hotel balcony high above the city, it looks like a gleaming first-world forest of hi-tech skyscrapers, emblazoned in neon with the names of multinationals. Down at street level, the shiny hauteur gives way to an anarchy of dust and rubbish and food stalls and stinking slums - but the slums aren't sultry ponds of lifelessness, they're frenzies of industry. It is a bewilderment of enterprise - clothing sweat shops crammed in next to computer shops, then a jewellery emporium next door to a store selling safes - and the traffic is a judder of gridlock and mayhem, steered by drivers in face masks, cheeks smudged with oily pollution. Bangkok lies along a river, and from 6am this takes on the appearance of the M25. The water churns with boats ferrying the city to work, and office girls in short skirts, old women with groceries, young monks and startled tourists all leap as the vessels come careering on and off the landings, navigated by nothing more than a man on the bow whistling instructions to a driver who can't see a thing. There is a glorious and universal disregard for order - it is as if there are no rules as long as you're making money, and as if the entire city is on speed. Which isn't too far from the truth. Amphetamines are abundant in Thailand, as is political corruption; the latest scandal to emerge during our stay were photographs of the prime minister with one of the country's leading dealers in speed pills. If a spirit of enterprising lawlessness accounted for Thailand's manic growth before the tiger crash of 1997, it is making a more orderly recovery difficult, and the city is tangled in poverty and confusions of desires. You can't move for temples or monks, and devotion to the King is extravagantly traditional - but after a rush of first-world wealth, Bangkok's profit impulse is so strong you can almost taste it in the air. And to judge from the tipsy grins that spread across the tourists' faces as they pile off the planes, it rather looks as if they have. \"You've just got to be hard,\" the woman in the hotel foyer informed us through pinched lips. She'd arrived from Yorkshire with her husband that morning, and straight off they'd gone shopping. She showed off her fake Prada handbags with grim satisfaction, while her husband talked us through the details of their haggling strategy like an angler reliving how he landed a shark. They'd not slept yet, but they'd been straight to the market; other activities on their itinerary were to get suits hand made by one of Bangkok's million tailors, and to bag some cheap jewellery. They'd dropped by the King's Palace (\"very interesting\") but not stayed long; they'd like to have seen some temples, of course, but time was short, what with all the shopping to be done. They had also found time to have a look at Patpong, Bangkok's red light district, home of the internationally renowned ping-pong shows. If there is one thing even cheaper in Bangkok than a tailor-made suit, it's sex, and the streets around Patpong are clogged with tour buses depositing middle-aged tourists curious to go and see go-go girls eject ping-pong balls from their vaginas. It is an odd phenomenon. Thais may be in a state of some confusion about their morality, and their dual enthusiasms for Buddhism and vice may be puzzling. But Thais have nothing on the Western tourists who'd turn the telly over if EastEnders got too steamy back home, but who flock cheerfully to Patpong for a cocktail and a Kodak moment.

      "byline": "Tom Allan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Our first sight of a dome in London came as our coach passed the Regents Park mosque - a building with a definite sense of identity. We were heading for a more dubious structure: the Millennium Dome. A special British party to celebrate the year 2000AD? It reminds me of Alan Jackson's short poem, A Young Politician Looks at the Moon: \"What a lovely moon./And it's in the constituency too!\" </p> <p>The home of GMT has no relevance to events in Roman Palestine, yet I was keen to see what form the celebration would take, and how it would treat sculpture. The prospect of a mid-winter break at the four-star Holiday Inn was also persuasive. </p> <p>The Richard Rogers' Dome is a magnificent venue - it harmonises with its surroundings, as do the \"outbuildings\", especially the Pier and the Pavilion. But what is being celebrated seems at first to be nothing more than the British passion for queuing. On the first normal Saturday of the year, all zones that looked even vaguely interesting were queued out of sight. Queues snaked among queues and we spoke to queuers who didn't know what they were queuing to see. </p> <p>I adopted a selective agenda, which you'd be well advised to do since it's impossible to see even half of the Dome in a day. The New Millennium Dome Experience Company should obviously introduce a season ticket. Another obstacle was the lack of clear guidance. The preview leaflet made the cut-away Dome look like a pizza with exotic toppings. And it was about as useful as a pizza for locating things. </p> <p>In fact, walking round the perimeter to see the outdoor sculptures turned out to be the best part of the day in many ways. The riverside is a great location for an event of this kind and, although it hasn't been fully exploited, it could rival Glasgow's Garden Festival site, with more landscaping and planning. The broad swell of the Thames is a superb elemental backdrop. </p> <p>Anthony Gormley's Quantum Cloud erupts like a static explosion, a humanistic totem of angled metal, beside the Pier. According to the Piermaster, many of its sections were assembled the wrong way round, which may explain why the figure within is hard to spot. Its fascination is in the changing shape from each angle, and it is certainly art that people can relate to, even though it's \"abstract\" and challenging. </p> <p>Moored alongside the Dome is what at first appears to be a tanker. You see only the bridge, then as you approach you realise that the bridge is all there is. Or rather, it is a complete section of the boat, top to bottom, sliced straight down through the funnel and in front of the bridge, by Richard Wilson, entitled Slice of Reality. Is this all the reality we can bear? </p> <p>The huge open space between this and the Dome is occupied by one sculpture only, a large triple form in glassfibre, looking like a pile of old car wheels, a misshapen spinning-top, a deformed crankshaft, or three piles of dirty dishes. It is perhaps rescued by its plinth, and the space between its components: people love having their photo taken there. </p> <p>As you move indoors, the Faith Zone attracts by having no queue. Some of its presentation is questionable: who is going to read the little scrolls of \"prayers for the millennium\" that children intently write and push into metal waste bins? Who is the woman between Gwynedd and Martin Luther King? She looks like Margaret Thatcher, but is Barbara Castle. Why? The central feature of this zone, however, puts questions to rest: James Turrell's Night Rain, a light space, is like an illuminated walk-in Mark Rothko, and evokes either a contented return to the womb, or contemplation of interstellar space. </p> <p>The adjacent Mind Zone, however, is less focused.

      "bodyText": "Our first sight of a dome in London came as our coach passed the Regents Park mosque - a building with a definite sense of identity. We were heading for a more dubious structure: the Millennium Dome. A special British party to celebrate the year 2000AD? It reminds me of Alan Jackson's short poem, A Young Politician Looks at the Moon: \"What a lovely moon./And it's in the constituency too!\" The home of GMT has no relevance to events in Roman Palestine, yet I was keen to see what form the celebration would take, and how it would treat sculpture. The prospect of a mid-winter break at the four-star Holiday Inn was also persuasive. The Richard Rogers' Dome is a magnificent venue - it harmonises with its surroundings, as do the \"outbuildings\", especially the Pier and the Pavilion. But what is being celebrated seems at first to be nothing more than the British passion for queuing. On the first normal Saturday of the year, all zones that looked even vaguely interesting were queued out of sight. Queues snaked among queues and we spoke to queuers who didn't know what they were queuing to see. I adopted a selective agenda, which you'd be well advised to do since it's impossible to see even half of the Dome in a day. The New Millennium Dome Experience Company should obviously introduce a season ticket. Another obstacle was the lack of clear guidance. The preview leaflet made the cut-away Dome look like a pizza with exotic toppings. And it was about as useful as a pizza for locating things. In fact, walking round the perimeter to see the outdoor sculptures turned out to be the best part of the day in many ways. The riverside is a great location for an event of this kind and, although it hasn't been fully exploited, it could rival Glasgow's Garden Festival site, with more landscaping and planning. The broad swell of the Thames is a superb elemental backdrop. Anthony Gormley's Quantum Cloud erupts like a static explosion, a humanistic totem of angled metal, beside the Pier. According to the Piermaster, many of its sections were assembled the wrong way round, which may explain why the figure within is hard to spot. Its fascination is in the changing shape from each angle, and it is certainly art that people can relate to, even though it's \"abstract\" and challenging. Moored alongside the Dome is what at first appears to be a tanker. You see only the bridge, then as you approach you realise that the bridge is all there is. Or rather, it is a complete section of the boat, top to bottom, sliced straight down through the funnel and in front of the bridge, by Richard Wilson, entitled Slice of Reality. Is this all the reality we can bear? The huge open space between this and the Dome is occupied by one sculpture only, a large triple form in glassfibre, looking like a pile of old car wheels, a misshapen spinning-top, a deformed crankshaft, or three piles of dirty dishes. It is perhaps rescued by its plinth, and the space between its components: people love having their photo taken there. As you move indoors, the Faith Zone attracts by having no queue. Some of its presentation is questionable: who is going to read the little scrolls of \"prayers for the millennium\" that children intently write and push into metal waste bins? Who is the woman between Gwynedd and Martin Luther King? She looks like Margaret Thatcher, but is Barbara Castle. Why? The central feature of this zone, however, puts questions to rest: James Turrell's Night Rain, a light space, is like an illuminated walk-in Mark Rothko, and evokes either a contented return to the womb, or contemplation of interstellar space. The adjacent Mind Zone, however, is less focused. I had been anticipating something special in the Crouching Boy sculpture. He is large and skilfully realistic, with perhaps some feeling and expressiveness. But he is still a let-down. As they passed, some youths made farting noises, unfortunately apt for the squatting posture. The rest of this zone was frustrating. The Richard Deacon overhanging structure - interlinked wooden shapes suggesting the folds of the brain, under the \"largest unsupported cantilever building in Europe\" - show how much effort and expense have been lavished here. Suffocating in spaces crammed with crowds, we escaped via the fire exit. Some of the zone structures could themselves be viewed as sculpture, and are interesting shapes. The cerise stalagmites of Our Town Stage stretch dramatically for the ceiling. The Rest Zone is a simple but effective idea, a rainbow striped vertically. Journey looks exciting, though brutal - a tank, battleship, or space-rocket, with lights flashing the whole length. The remainder are poor: Talk conveys the feeling of a particularly boring office; Timekeepers of the Millennium is literally hellish - a Heath Robinson caged structure where people fight a strange, pointless battle, shuffling through like obedient cannon-fodder, to be bombarded with missiles and inane electronic voices, yet queuing for hours for the privilege. Many zones look anonymous, though they may contain wonders. But you can't escape the Body. Perhaps it's so popular because it's immediately recognisable, and people have heard some of the hype about its contents. As a sculpture, though, it strikes me as more a balloon than a human figure. It is bulbous and pink, a feat of engineering perhaps, but appallingly naff. Maybe ambiguity and split personality were forced on it, but that's no excuse. A strange silver homunculus is trapped in a spinning perspex globe near the breast of the giant. Rays of light emanating from this feature appear comically to make possible erogenous areas of the Body vibrate. An accident, but the only amusing thing about this monstrous overblown figure. Sadly, there is no Erogenous Zone in the Dome. What finally gave us the nearest thing to a Wow Factor were two very different contributions.

The sailor stared out across a narrow waterway.</p> <p> The waterway was dominated by splendid two-storey apartment houses and even more splendid yachts and motor-cruisers. From atop a shopping-mall bandstand, a younger Teresa Gorman-lookalike was earning rapturous murmurs and muffled applause. The local radio station's Wet T-shirt competition was underway by the harbour.

That was of the late Kaiser, a gift from a land whose romantic dreams and nightmares once hugely affected Norway. Wilhelm holidayed in 1/8Alesund.

The monuments are usually women, grouped in socialist-realist style, eyes fixed across sounds, beyond mountains, out to sea; waiting for fishermen to return, waiting for food, waiting through winter darkness for the sun.</p> <p> Steam changed their world completely. In July 1893, Captain Richard With, aboard the Vesteraalen, set off from Trondheim for Hammerfest. The regular Hurtigruten - the Norwegian coastal steamer - was born.

By 1898, the ships were starting from Bergen, by 1914 they had reached as far north as Kirkenes, border of the Russian empire.</p> <p> Eighty-five years later, that was my route, 2,400km, a distance greater than London to Warsaw, on the diesel-powered, computer-guided Polarlys, past towns and villages and settlements, gliding between mountains, past the country's second largest glacier, the Svartisen, into the Arctic Circle and on to Kirkenes, about which I had enjoyed Harry Palmer-style fantasies, but which was to prove an anti-climax.</p> <p> There was a rust-encrusted freighter out of nearby Murmansk in the harbour, a vast and recently-closed open-cast iron-ore mine-cum-wasteland and, at the crossing with Yeltsin's kleptocracy, a poignant sign.

Huge in the 1930s, decimated in the war, booming in the 1950s, by the end of the 1980s it was losing money. From the deck of Polarlys - one of 11 Hurtigruten ships - its problem was evident all along that coast: bridges, splendid, elegant pay-offs from Norway's oil money, wisely, publicly invested by prudent governments (see Thatcher, M). Structures that leap headlands and turn islands into suburbs arc over the Polarlys, and make a coastal drive to Kirkenes a scenic, if seasonal possibility. So, the service was revamped and marketed as 'the world's most beautiful sea voyage'.</p> <p> Bergen is splendid, Trond heim boasts a fine cathedral, the setting of Tromso is magnificent, Saturday night in Henningsvaer in the Lofoten Islands is starkly beautiful with its boulevards of water - if apparently devoid of population - but the Polarlys's schedule meant that the time I spent in any of them was brief.</p> <p> It did not rain all the time.

It's perfect for a weekend break but, if you have more time, head to the desert at Erfoud, where Lawrence of Arabia and The Mummy were filmed among the rippling Merzouga sand dunes. Across a plain criss-crossed by dirt tracks, Chez Michel appears like an oasis, the only colour in a barren landscape. It has a few simple rooms and is frequented by ambassadors to Rabat. A double room at Chez Michel costs \u00a340 per night.<br>Cadogan Holidays 023808 28303<br>Best of Morocco 01380 828533<br>Morocco Made to Measure 0171-235 2110</p> <p><strong>Mexico</strong></p> <p>Fly to Cancun, and try to ignore the eyesore of tourism, great towers of concrete hiding the Caribbean sea. Immediately take the rickety ferry boat to Isla Mujeres and paradise. The small island has been inhabited since pre-Columbian times and still maintains the culture of its Mayan past. It is an excellent base for exploring the Mayan cities of the Yucatan. Stay at the romantic Na Balam Beach hotel, which is small - 31 rooms - but has extensive grounds and a long stretch of private beach with hammocks among the palm trees. A double room costs \u00a385 per night.<br>Trips Worldwide 0117 987 2626</p> <p><strong>Bermuda</strong></p> <p>For a touch of colonial life with moderate temperatures (20C in February) and a flying time of seven hours from Britain, Bermuda offers rural England in the sun. The best accommodation are traditional Bermudan cottages. One of the best is Cambridge Beaches, a remote resort on the western tip of Bermuda attracting couples into serious hedonism. It has the rare combination of stunning private beaches, a state-of-the-art spa and good food. There's tennis, croquet, bicycles, a marina and private dock. For a romantic one-off, this is the place to get out your credit card and don't think about the bill until later. Cambridge Beaches' rooms start at \u00a3280 per night for a garden room including breakfast and dinner for two people.<br>Lotus Supertravel 0171-962 9494<br>Prestige 01425 480400</p> <p><strong>The Canaries</strong></p> <p>Guaranteed sun and favourable prices have made the Canaries the first port of call for Brits who want winter basking. The big tour operators are there en masse with bargain price breaks starting from \u00a3250 or less for seven nights, with half-term being very busy indeed. All the main islands - Lanzarote, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Fuerteventura - offer very different holidays and landscapes. Tenerife, for example, which has some of the least enticing beaches, has the spectacular Mount Teide National Park with stunning scenery and walks. For complete isolation try the small Hotel Punta Grande on El Hierro (00 34 922 559081, \u00a3732 per night for a double room).<br>Virgin Sun 01293 432100<br>Lanzarote Leisure 0181-449 7441</p> <p><strong>Dubai</strong></p> <p>This is the destination for a quick winter fix. Dubai is the land of beach resorts and all-inclusive packages. If you want to play golf and swan around in luxury, the newly-opened Royal Mirage, opposite the Emirates Golf Club, will impress. It was originally an Arabian fortress and has been gutted and remodelled to five-star perfection. A deluxe room at the Royal Mirage costs \u00a3928 per person for five nights, including flights.<br>Elegant Resorts 0870 33 33 390<br> Magic of the Orient 01293 537700.</p>",

It's perfect for a weekend break but, if you have more time, head to the desert at Erfoud, where Lawrence of Arabia and The Mummy were filmed among the rippling Merzouga sand dunes. Across a plain criss-crossed by dirt tracks, Chez Michel appears like an oasis, the only colour in a barren landscape. It has a few simple rooms and is frequented by ambassadors to Rabat.

Immediately take the rickety ferry boat to Isla Mujeres and paradise. The small island has been inhabited since pre-Columbian times and still maintains the culture of its Mayan past. It is an excellent base for exploring the Mayan cities of the Yucatan. Stay at the romantic Na Balam Beach hotel, which is small - 31 rooms - but has extensive grounds and a long stretch of private beach with hammocks among the palm trees. A double room costs \u00a385 per night.

The best accommodation are traditional Bermudan cottages. One of the best is Cambridge Beaches, a remote resort on the western tip of Bermuda attracting couples into serious hedonism. It has the rare combination of stunning private beaches, a state-of-the-art spa and good food. There's tennis, croquet, bicycles, a marina and private dock.

      "body": "<p>We arrived at our hotel, the excellent Villa Real, just after midnight on the Friday. Adela Gooch, the Guardian's Madrid correspondent, had told us that midnight was the perfect time for a grand entrance, since the city was just getting ready for the night's drinking and revelry. Revelry? We were late and tired and totally whacked. So we went to bed and slept through what is, they say, the wildest part of the week in Madrid. </p> <p>The advantage was that we woke up feeling terrific and ready to go to the Prado, possibly the greatest art gallery in the world. Nothing prepares you for the Prado, or for even the length of the queues that snake right round the building on weekends, including at the beginning and start of the day. The received wisdom is that you can't take it all in, and should make several trips, each perhaps devoted to a particular artist - Goya or Vel\u00e1squez, for example. But a 48-hour tripper can't afford all that time, and after waiting half an hour or so in the queue, we plunged on and in, determined to see as much as we could. </p> <p>It's worth the price of admission (a mere 500 pesetas, about \u00a32 a head) for the Black Paintings of Goya alone. They are weird, schizophrenic and terrifying, so surreal it's almost impossible to believe they were created nearly 200 years ago. But, of course, they have the Majas, as well, both naked and clothed, the celebrated Third of May 1808 showing the French executing prisoners in Madrid. (Funny how the Spanish see themselves as an innocent, colonised nation, when, of course, they were one of the most ferocious colonisers.) And there are the portraits - golly, the Spanish royals were so ugly in those days that even Goya's skill could not rescue their features - and those other pictures that linger in the mind, some suitable for chocolate boxes (The Swing) and others from nightmares (Saturn Devouring One of His Children). </p> <p>Onwards we rushed, past Vel\u00e1squez, El Greco, Murillo, Botticelli, Poussin, Rembrandt, Van Dyck and Breugel, then on to the astounding Hieronymus Bosch room, where we were brought to a standstill by the Garden of Earthly Delights, a picture so startling, so resonant, so arresting and somehow so apt for the 21st century that it wouldn't stand a chance of winning the Turner Prize. </p> <p>By now, it was past 2pm, and though early for a Spanish lunch, we dragged our flat and weary feet off to La Trucha, at 6 Calle Nunez de Arce, which is famous for its smoked fish, and where the trout was, as the name of the place would imply, absolutely excellent. The joy of Spanish restaurants is that you don't have to choose the entire meal in advance. You pick and choose from the dishes on the menu, they're brought as and when they're ready, and if you fancy something the next table is eating, you can simply point. </p> <p>Back to the hotel for the siesta. No point in flogging round the city if none of its citizens are. Later, Adela came round - \"we'll meet early,\" she'd said, \"around half past eight.\" The shops were open and packed. We went to Madrid's main department store, El Corte Ingles (\"the English Cut\"; it started life as a tailors). We were on the lookout for a Real Madrid shirt - which cost much the same as it would in the UK - and for other things which might be cheaper. Most were. </p> <p>Next, we popped back to Adela's flat for a bottle of chilled cava, fastened with what appeared to be a rusted chastity belt. She had to take it to her neighbourhood bar to find how to open it (answer: with a small quantity of Semtex). </p> <p>She'd booked us in at the Casa Botin, founded in 1725. By the time we arrived, at about 10.45pm, most of the tourists had gone, and we could enjoy the gorgeous panelled and tiled rooms, the elderly waiters who had clearly spent several lifetimes working there, and the extraordinary aroma of their specialities: roast Aranda lamb, and suckling pigs from both Avila and Segovia. Gourmets can tell the difference. I had a quarter suckling pig from one place or the other. It's a dish that can be tricky for British visitors, since some restaurants like to display the little piglets, lying on the counter like dead corgis. Happily, I conquered any lingering, atavistic distaste, and scarfed down the lot - utterly delicious. And a bunch of students with doublets and stringed instruments came and serenaded us. At home, we would have cringed. There, it worked. Rather like drinking retsina in Greece. The bill for three was an amazingly low \u00a344. </p> <p>By now, it was around 1am and Madrid was waking up for the night. We went bar-hopping. Everyone was full, everywhere was loud, everyone seemed pleasantly pissed but good-humoured, as unlike the West End as it's possible to be. No point in recommending one bar or another; stroll by and try whichever appeals. We sampled a jazz bar, the Caf\u00e9 Pueblo, but there are hundreds of others. </p> <p>Next day, we headed for the celebrated Rastro flea market, which sells everything - clothes, toys, furniture, cookery equipment, knick-knacks of every kind, saddles, even vicious-looking military equipment. By noon, it was almost impossible to move through the crowds, for the most part local people. </p> <p>Next stop was one of the branches of the Museo del Jam\u00f3n which are scattered around the city. The Spanish take their ham with incredible seriousness. These \"museums\" - actually big delis - sell a vast range of hams which hang on great hooks from the ceiling, not unlike a Hieronymus Bosch painting. The cost ranges from about 2,000 pesetas a kilo (about \u00a38) to 12,000 pesetas (\u00a348). The latter are made from small, black-trottered pigs fed on acorns. Only an expert can tell the difference, but the thing to look for are streaks of fat flecking the lean bits. </p> <p>This just left time for a trip to Madrid's superb main square, the Plaza Mayor, where we sipped coffee in the wintry sunshine. Adela had suggested we join her and her friends for a Sunday aperitivo. You meet in a bar, naturally, and since it's pre-lunch drinks and snacks, you meet very early - at 2pm, practically the crack of dawn. Fresh anchovies, grilled prawns, mushrooms with ham, hot asparagus with garlic mayonnaise, meat bruchetas and fried whitebait, were washed down with cold beers, colder manzanilla sherry, and lively chat as people move round the bar as if at a cocktail party. Most tapas come with little paper frills to keep your fingers clean and you drop them on the floor; Madrilenos will stand by the door and rate a bar's food by the depths of white detritus on the floor. By 4pm we felt stuffed to the gills and the other customers were leaving. We asked where - the answer was home for their real Sunday lunch, probably another five courses. </p> <p>By this time, the weekend was beginning to seem like a grand bouffe . And so it was. Guilt alone drove us to Madrid's other great art gallery, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, once a private collection, now open to all. There's an amazingly eclectic range of works, from Italian primitives, through Titian and Caravaggio to Dali, Hopper and Bacon. By the end, I felt a better person, and in urgent need of a nap. </p> <p>That night, we finished by gliding past scores of restaurants and were finally enticed into one by a huge bowl of paella, roughly the size of a cartwheel. It sat by the door, steaming fragrantly. </p> <p>We left first thing the next day having had a fine Madrid weekend, eating too much good food, drinking too much good wine, sleeping too long, and gazing at too much great art. It worked for us. </p> <p><strong>10 of the best </strong></p> <p><strong>Restaurants</strong><br> Prices pounds 20-40pp with wine, unless otherwise stated.</p> <p> 1 Casa Botin Cuchilleros 17.

      "bodyText": "We arrived at our hotel, the excellent Villa Real, just after midnight on the Friday. Adela Gooch, the Guardian's Madrid correspondent, had told us that midnight was the perfect time for a grand entrance, since the city was just getting ready for the night's drinking and revelry. Revelry? We were late and tired and totally whacked. So we went to bed and slept through what is, they say, the wildest part of the week in Madrid. The advantage was that we woke up feeling terrific and ready to go to the Prado, possibly the greatest art gallery in the world. Nothing prepares you for the Prado, or for even the length of the queues that snake right round the building on weekends, including at the beginning and start of the day. The received wisdom is that you can't take it all in, and should make several trips, each perhaps devoted to a particular artist - Goya or Vel\u00e1squez, for example. But a 48-hour tripper can't afford all that time, and after waiting half an hour or so in the queue, we plunged on and in, determined to see as much as we could. It's worth the price of admission (a mere 500 pesetas, about \u00a32 a head) for the Black Paintings of Goya alone. They are weird, schizophrenic and terrifying, so surreal it's almost impossible to believe they were created nearly 200 years ago. But, of course, they have the Majas, as well, both naked and clothed, the celebrated Third of May 1808 showing the French executing prisoners in Madrid. (Funny how the Spanish see themselves as an innocent, colonised nation, when, of course, they were one of the most ferocious colonisers.) And there are the portraits - golly, the Spanish royals were so ugly in those days that even Goya's skill could not rescue their features - and those other pictures that linger in the mind, some suitable for chocolate boxes (The Swing) and others from nightmares (Saturn Devouring One of His Children). Onwards we rushed, past Vel\u00e1squez, El Greco, Murillo, Botticelli, Poussin, Rembrandt, Van Dyck and Breugel, then on to the astounding Hieronymus Bosch room, where we were brought to a standstill by the Garden of Earthly Delights, a picture so startling, so resonant, so arresting and somehow so apt for the 21st century that it wouldn't stand a chance of winning the Turner Prize. By now, it was past 2pm, and though early for a Spanish lunch, we dragged our flat and weary feet off to La Trucha, at 6 Calle Nunez de Arce, which is famous for its smoked fish, and where the trout was, as the name of the place would imply, absolutely excellent. The joy of Spanish restaurants is that you don't have to choose the entire meal in advance. You pick and choose from the dishes on the menu, they're brought as and when they're ready, and if you fancy something the next table is eating, you can simply point. Back to the hotel for the siesta. No point in flogging round the city if none of its citizens are. Later, Adela came round - \"we'll meet early,\" she'd said, \"around half past eight.\" The shops were open and packed. We went to Madrid's main department store, El Corte Ingles (\"the English Cut\"; it started life as a tailors). We were on the lookout for a Real Madrid shirt - which cost much the same as it would in the UK - and for other things which might be cheaper. Most were. Next, we popped back to Adela's flat for a bottle of chilled cava, fastened with what appeared to be a rusted chastity belt. She had to take it to her neighbourhood bar to find how to open it (answer: with a small quantity of Semtex). She'd booked us in at the Casa Botin, founded in 1725. By the time we arrived, at about 10.45pm, most of the tourists had gone, and we could enjoy the gorgeous panelled and tiled rooms, the elderly waiters who had clearly spent several lifetimes working there, and the extraordinary aroma of their specialities: roast Aranda lamb, and suckling pigs from both Avila and Segovia. Gourmets can tell the difference. I had a quarter suckling pig from one place or the other. It's a dish that can be tricky for British visitors, since some restaurants like to display the little piglets, lying on the counter like dead corgis. Happily, I conquered any lingering, atavistic distaste, and scarfed down the lot - utterly delicious. And a bunch of students with doublets and stringed instruments came and serenaded us. At home, we would have cringed. There, it worked. Rather like drinking retsina in Greece. The bill for three was an amazingly low \u00a344. By now, it was around 1am and Madrid was waking up for the night. We went bar-hopping. Everyone was full, everywhere was loud, everyone seemed pleasantly pissed but good-humoured, as unlike the West End as it's possible to be. No point in recommending one bar or another; stroll by and try whichever appeals. We sampled a jazz bar, the Caf\u00e9 Pueblo, but there are hundreds of others. Next day, we headed for the celebrated Rastro flea market, which sells everything - clothes, toys, furniture, cookery equipment, knick-knacks of every kind, saddles, even vicious-looking military equipment. By noon, it was almost impossible to move through the crowds, for the most part local people. Next stop was one of the branches of the Museo del Jam\u00f3n which are scattered around the city. The Spanish take their ham with incredible seriousness. These \"museums\" - actually big delis - sell a vast range of hams which hang on great hooks from the ceiling, not unlike a Hieronymus Bosch painting. The cost ranges from about 2,000 pesetas a kilo (about \u00a38) to 12,000 pesetas (\u00a348). The latter are made from small, black-trottered pigs fed on acorns. Only an expert can tell the difference, but the thing to look for are streaks of fat flecking the lean bits. This just left time for a trip to Madrid's superb main square, the Plaza Mayor, where we sipped coffee in the wintry sunshine. Adela had suggested we join her and her friends for a Sunday aperitivo. You meet in a bar, naturally, and since it's pre-lunch drinks and snacks, you meet very early - at 2pm, practically the crack of dawn. Fresh anchovies, grilled prawns, mushrooms with ham, hot asparagus with garlic mayonnaise, meat bruchetas and fried whitebait, were washed down with cold beers, colder manzanilla sherry, and lively chat as people move round the bar as if at a cocktail party. Most tapas come with little paper frills to keep your fingers clean and you drop them on the floor; Madrilenos will stand by the door and rate a bar's food by the depths of white detritus on the floor. By 4pm we felt stuffed to the gills and the other customers were leaving. We asked where - the answer was home for their real Sunday lunch, probably another five courses. By this time, the weekend was beginning to seem like a grand bouffe . And so it was. Guilt alone drove us to Madrid's other great art gallery, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, once a private collection, now open to all. There's an amazingly eclectic range of works, from Italian primitives, through Titian and Caravaggio to Dali, Hopper and Bacon. By the end, I felt a better person, and in urgent need of a nap. That night, we finished by gliding past scores of restaurants and were finally enticed into one by a huge bowl of paella, roughly the size of a cartwheel. It sat by the door, steaming fragrantly. We left first thing the next day having had a fine Madrid weekend, eating too much good food, drinking too much good wine, sleeping too long, and gazing at too much great art. It worked for us. 10 of the best Restaurants Prices pounds 20-40pp with wine, unless otherwise stated. 1 Casa Botin Cuchilleros 17.

      "body": "<p>It starts at two in the morning. I've been to bed - I'm a visitor, after all, unused to the rigours of Carnival. Perhaps it's because the hands on my body clock are spinning in contrary directions that what follows seems faintly unreal: dancing - \"chipping\" - en masse through Port of Spain in pursuit of a steel band making stately progress to nowhere in particular; smearing and being smeared in mud and paint by muddy, painted devils; limbo dancing badly at sunrise. This is J'Ouvert, the nocturnal orgy that kick-starts the biggest street party in the world. </p> <p>The devils are \"jab-jabs\", one of few remaining traditional Carnival characters. It's a tradition, too, that if you're clean, they'll splatter you with a tankard of goo scooped from tin baths wheeled behind the monolithic sound systems that pass through Port of Spain's avenues ripping the air with dins that rasp \"stampede!\" or \"bacchanal!\" </p> <p>\"Chipping\" is the loose-limbed tramp with which that pageant's disciples give chase. It resembles an exhausted stagger, which is convenient, because even after four hours of \"jumping up\" and downing Carib beer, I don't look out of place. At daybreak, my gyrations - I call it limbo at the risk of besmirching a cornerstone of Trinidadian culture - clumsily denote an epiphany, that moment when dancing and music have eclipsed and express everything. </p> <p>\"Dance!\" novelist Earl Lovelace wrote of calypso and Carnival, \"If the words mourn the death of a neighbour, the music insists that you dance; if it tells the troubles of a brother, the music says dance. Dance to the hurt! It is in dancing that you ward off evil. Dance!\" </p> <p>He is true to his word: I saw him at Carnival, dancing. The breadth of commitment to the event is astonishing: that the literati, like Lovelace, and politicians - last year, finance minister Brian Tung was snapped in wild abandon - should want and are able to muck in speaks of a cultural democracy we can only dream of. Compare and contrast to William Hague at Notting Hill. </p> <p>But Carnival isn't an appendage to Trinidadian life, it is the culmination of Trinidadian life. Here's Lovelace again: \"This is the guts of the people, their blood; this is the self of the people that they screaming out they possess, that they scrimp and save and whore and work and thief to drag out of the hard rockstone and dirt to show the world they is people\". </p> <p>I was struck, reading local papers for a week before Carnival, by its monopoly on the news. Who won the Calypso Monarch title (Singing Sandra), whether Trinidad's very own Miss Universe would sacrifice Fashion Week for Carnival (she did), why Carnival gets the army's goat (revellers in uniform) - the Trinidad Guardian held its front page. </p> <p>You can also gauge the obsession by the preparation: Carnival begins at Christmas. I arrived in Port of Spain at midnight and found the town's social life by cocking my ear to the wind. Follow that tinkling noise to one of many ramshackle panyards; here, the city's numerous steel bands rehearse for Carnival nightly - and all night - to crowds of drinkers and fans. There are plenty of both: the Trinidadian's capacity to enjoy himself is admirable. You know you're in the right place when the keys of your hire car come with bottle-opener attached. </p> <p>The island's steel-band culture resembles football culture in Britain, except - and this is characteristic of Trinidad - it is creative and participatory. Steel bands, like football, sprang from working-class communities, an expression of their identity and - frequently - rage. Flare-ups between bands form Carnival legend: Invaders versus Tokyo in 1950 (nine injured); Desperadoes versus San Juan All Stars in '59 (30 injured). Recent years have seen Carnival's maverick tradition diluted; like our national sport, it's been gentrified and corporatised. Invaders are sponsored by the national airline. \"Play mas\", the billboards say, \"Drink Coca-Cola\". \"Mas\" means masquerade. J'Ouvert is \"dirty mas\", the relic of satirical, subversive Carnivals gone by.</p> <p>At J'Ouvert, the past slings gunk at the present, or \"pretty mas\", which dominates Carnival Tuesday. It's pretty because Carnival has been inherited - some might say hijacked by powerful designers. It costs the price of a costume - industriously produced in mas camps in the months preceding Carnival - to participate; some banks advertise loans for the purpose. In the words of Peter Minshall, mas designer and orchestrator of the opening ceremony at the Barcelona Olympics, \"In most countries, people pay to see others perform; in Trinidad, they pay to perform.\" </p> <p>While there are isolated instances of preposterous sartorial extravagance - 10ft tall costumes, supported by wheels, fashioned to evoke flowers, or witch doctors, or frogs - these are exceptions to the prevailing rule, which states: it's Carnival, wear a bikini. On Tuesday, one phalanx after another of flesh-baring men and many more women charge across a vast stage traversing the Queen's Park Savannah, the city's lung and hub of Carnival. Purple knickers wink and sequinned silver thongs thrust; golden bras bulge and fiery red headgear blooms, tropically. Bands keep passing and colours keep intensifying, until your eyes ache, and still it won't stop. The year before last, the biggest band, Poison, had 10,000 members. They took two hours to cross the stage. </p> <p>I pop outside. Half a mile from the grandstand's cocktail-tinted chaos, I still hear the same incessant tunes. </p> <p>There's a competition (Carnival is a series of contests) for a song to be crowned \"Road March\" - usually soca, which is a mix of soul and calypso driven by a heavy beat. Carnival's soundtrack comprises a handful of insistently catchy refrains, looped, and to even suggest what it's like to be there, I'd have to persuade the Guardian to attach an accompanying CD. The pre-eminence of sound systems, at the expense of steel bands - whose involvement peaks at the Panorama competition two nights before Carnival begins - is a symptom of this event's sometimes painful evolution from home-spun f\u00eate to international post-modern extravaganza. Even calypso is undergoing an identity crisis. </p> <p>Veterans worry that wry reflection is giving way to venom: when, at last year's Carnival, calypsonian Sugar Aloes lyrically ribbed the prime minister's wife, both Sugar Aloes' legendary forebear The Mighty Sparrow and the PM, Basdeo Panday, both leapt to the stricken damsel's defence. </p> <p>By way of personalising that schism between what Trinidad was and is becoming, a local artist named Kathryn Chan - who is curating an exhibition of Carnival artefacts at London's Horniman Museum later this year - introduced me to several neglected figures from Carnival's past. </p> <p>By the candy-coloured shanty towns of suburban Port of Spain, she drove me to the collapsible house - it was held up by a cactus - of Cito Velazquez. He was the Minshall of his day; his work so impressed Dr Eric Williams that the then PM commissioned him to adorn Port of Spain with sculptures to mark independence in 1962. We later met Leighton James, an unheralded grass-roots artist who has carved an incredibly expressive tableau of figurines representing Velazquez's 1959 Carnival presentation, Flowers and Fruits. </p> <p>Both men's work is simultaneously poignant and inspiring. While James's fancy-dressed maquettes depict a Carnival that's more specific than today's \"bacchanal\" to the Caribbean's unique folklore, the circumstances of their creation testify again to Trinidad's trademark: this is a culture that's fearless in the face of creative expression. Its front rooms can be galleries, its backstreet courtyards concert halls, and at its parties, everyone dances. </p> <p><strong>Do</strong></p> <p><strong>Play mas</strong></p> <p>Carnival is for flexing the party muscles, not the eyeballs.</p> <p><strong>Let rip</strong></p> <p>\"If your parents told you not to do it,\" says the guidebook, \"J'Ouvert is an excellent place to try it.\"</p> <p><strong>Drink the rum</strong></p> <p>When in Trinidad, do as the Trinidadians do.</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong></p> <p><strong>Fill your pockets</strong></p> <p>Bags, wallets, jewellery - all are under threat from Carnival's light-fingered brigade.</p> <p><strong>Wear white on J'Ouvert</strong></p> <p>Unless you want to make an invitation of yourself to the mudslingers.</p> <p><strong>Be prudish</strong></p> <p>You'll see things in public that would make you blush in your own bedroom.</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Brian Logan flew to Trinidad with BWIA (<a href=\"http://www.bwee.com\">www.bwee.com</a>), as a guest of the Trinidad and Tobago tourist board, TIDCO (020 83501009, or <a href=\"http://www.visittnt.com\">www.visittnt.com</a>) Flights to Trinidad cost aboput \u00a3450, rising to \u00a3750 during carnival season.

J'Ouvert is \"dirty mas\", the relic of satirical, subversive Carnivals gone by. At J'Ouvert, the past slings gunk at the present, or \"pretty mas\", which dominates Carnival Tuesday. It's pretty because Carnival has been inherited - some might say hijacked by powerful designers. It costs the price of a costume - industriously produced in mas camps in the months preceding Carnival - to participate; some banks advertise loans for the purpose. In the words of Peter Minshall, mas designer and orchestrator of the opening ceremony at the Barcelona Olympics, \"In most countries, people pay to see others perform; in Trinidad, they pay to perform.\" While there are isolated instances of preposterous sartorial extravagance - 10ft tall costumes, supported by wheels, fashioned to evoke flowers, or witch doctors, or frogs - these are exceptions to the prevailing rule, which states: it's Carnival, wear a bikini. On Tuesday, one phalanx after another of flesh-baring men and many more women charge across a vast stage traversing the Queen's Park Savannah, the city's lung and hub of Carnival. Purple knickers wink and sequinned silver thongs thrust; golden bras bulge and fiery red headgear blooms, tropically. Bands keep passing and colours keep intensifying, until your eyes ache, and still it won't stop. The year before last, the biggest band, Poison, had 10,000 members. They took two hours to cross the stage. I pop outside. Half a mile from the grandstand's cocktail-tinted chaos, I still hear the same incessant tunes. There's a competition (Carnival is a series of contests) for a song to be crowned \"Road March\" - usually soca, which is a mix of soul and calypso driven by a heavy beat. Carnival's soundtrack comprises a handful of insistently catchy refrains, looped, and to even suggest what it's like to be there, I'd have to persuade the Guardian to attach an accompanying CD. The pre-eminence of sound systems, at the expense of steel bands - whose involvement peaks at the Panorama competition two nights before Carnival begins - is a symptom of this event's sometimes painful evolution from home-spun f\u00eate to international post-modern extravaganza. Even calypso is undergoing an identity crisis. Veterans worry that wry reflection is giving way to venom: when, at last year's Carnival, calypsonian Sugar Aloes lyrically ribbed the prime minister's wife, both Sugar Aloes' legendary forebear The Mighty Sparrow and the PM, Basdeo Panday, both leapt to the stricken damsel's defence. By way of personalising that schism between what Trinidad was and is becoming, a local artist named Kathryn Chan - who is curating an exhibition of Carnival artefacts at London's Horniman Museum later this year - introduced me to several neglected figures from Carnival's past. By the candy-coloured shanty towns of suburban Port of Spain, she drove me to the collapsible house - it was held up by a cactus - of Cito Velazquez. He was the Minshall of his day; his work so impressed Dr Eric Williams that the then PM commissioned him to adorn Port of Spain with sculptures to mark independence in 1962. We later met Leighton James, an unheralded grass-roots artist who has carved an incredibly expressive tableau of figurines representing Velazquez's 1959 Carnival presentation, Flowers and Fruits. Both men's work is simultaneously poignant and inspiring. While James's fancy-dressed maquettes depict a Carnival that's more specific than today's \"bacchanal\" to the Caribbean's unique folklore, the circumstances of their creation testify again to Trinidad's trademark: this is a culture that's fearless in the face of creative expression. Its front rooms can be galleries, its backstreet courtyards concert halls, and at its parties, everyone dances. Do Play mas Carnival is for flexing the party muscles, not the eyeballs. Let rip \"If your parents told you not to do it,\" says the guidebook, \"J'Ouvert is an excellent place to try it.\" Drink the rum When in Trinidad, do as the Trinidadians do. Don't Fill your pockets Bags, wallets, jewellery - all are under threat from Carnival's light-fingered brigade. Wear white on J'Ouvert Unless you want to make an invitation of yourself to the mudslingers. Be prudish You'll see things in public that would make you blush in your own bedroom.

A luxury: A sarong or a large bath towel so that I could wash easily. Sometimes you have to wash in a public square, but a sarong means you can wash everything underneath it, get nice and clean and sit in the sun drying off. A memento: I don't take good luck charms, but one memento which I really like is a Buddha who is about a foot tall and quite heavy. I brought him back from Katmandu. He is a medicine Buddha and should cure all ills in the house if given the right chat-up line. I'm not a Buddhist, but I like to hedge my bets. If only: I've stopped taking a huge medical kit with me as can usually buy whatever I need in a chemist, but I get very cross when I find that some common-place medicine isn't available in the country I'm visiting, so I would like a book that translates all trade names into generic names so that I can work out related drugs that will do the job just as well. I do take the British National Formularly but it is not all-inclusive. \u0095 Dr Jane Wilson-Howarth will be giving advice and tips on how to stay healthy while travelling at Independent Traveller's World 2000 on Saturday January 29 at 2.30pm in Talk Room 4, part of the Safe Travel 2000 area.",

      "body": "<p>Alle Menschen werden Br\u00fcder - a reasonable sentiment, you might think, for a liberal newspaper to profess, but it would almost certainly be better if we skipped the German of Schiller's An die Freude and expressed our joy, even roughly, in English as, say, \"We are all in this together.\" </p> <p>We like to use foreign words, terms, phrases, but we often get them wrong. We even trip on common names, such as Giuseppe who regularly becomes Guiseppe - Gwee-seppy. </p> <p>Not long ago, to illustrate a point, we introduced a purely fictional Venezuelan maid into a story and called her Consuela. This brought a sharp note from a woman called, like thousands of other women in the Spanish-speaking world, Consuelo. </p> <p>\"I really have had enough of show-off ignoramuses messing up my name. Consuelo is a Spanish abstract noun, masculine, invariable. Pilar and Mercedes are also Spanish female names derived, like Consuelo, from titles of the Virgin Mary.\" It would be equally silly, she said, to stick an \"a\" on them. </p> <p>Names requiring accents seem to pose even greater difficulties. Extreme, and one has to say transparent, efforts are sometimes made to ensure that accents appear in the correct position. Alas, these efforts sometimes fail. They have caused us to refer to the soprano Christine Sch\u00e4fer as Christine Schumlautafer, and a work by Liszt became Funacuteerailles. The latter prompted a witty but wounding one-word rejoinder from a reader, \"Imbacuteeciles!\" </p> <p>Accent-induced anxiety is common among British journalists who find it difficult to understand why anyone should bother with such things. Foreign words that come into the English language bearing accents are stripped of them when the opportunity arises. Thus when I devoted a recent column to the clich\u00e9, you would have found when you picked the paper up on Saturday that I had been writing about the cliche, a deprivation let us concede more acute than grave. The tendency that it represents, although it may be seen by some as betraying our accents, is perhaps a good one. It is intended not as a slight - an act or omission indicating supercilious neglect or indifference (Collins) - aimed at a word's foreign origins, so much as an embrace or friendly adoption. </p> <p>Paradoxically the same anxiety I have mentioned often leads us to use accents like a condiment and to pepper foreign words with them more or less at random, so that readers who know about these things - a large, cosmopolitan and long-suffering congregation - have to ask us to desist. Here are just a couple of examples: The French word for a cluster of racing cyclists is peloton, not p\u00e9l\u00e9ton (It has nothing to do with a famous Brazilian footballer, this reader added, rather unnecessarily); Congratulations on getting L\u00e4nder right, another wrote, but the singular is Land not L\u00e4nd ... and so on. </p> <p>A recent article on French menus was returned marked in red ink by a reader with an indigestible total of more than 30 errors, most of them relating to missing or misplaced accents. </p> <p>We get worse as we move farther from Britain. We sometimes manage the diacritical tilde on Spanish words - ma\u00f1ana, for example - and sometimes not. For instance, a native or inhabitant of Madrid is a madrile\u00f1o/a, not a madrileno. </p> <p>During the World Cup coverage of 1998 a reader wrote to inquire why, since the Germans generally carried their umlauts proudly on to the pitch, and the French sometimes sported their accents, players of almost all other nationalities left theirs in the dressing room. M\u00f8ller was always Moller, the Argentine Ver\u00f3n and the Colombian Rinc\u00f3n stepped similarly naked on to the field. </p> <p> The Czech composers Jan\u00e1cek and Dvor\u00e1k may get their acute accents but the chances of parading the caron, the little v carried above the c and the r respectively, in the pages of the Guardian are practically nil because of technical difficulties. </p> <p>If you are Finnish, then, well, I am tempted to say forget it. We once misspelt the Finnish word for dyslexia (lukih\u00e4iri\u00f6). A few years ago we carried an article in translation from the Finnish daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The article was fine but the byline turned out to be not the name of the author but the Finnish for \"Continued on the next page\". </p> <p>Does any of this really matter? I think it does. I tend to agree with those readers who see it as a kind of parochialism detracting from their view of the Guardian as a paper with an unlimited horizon. Our style guide advises us only to keep all accents on French words and umlauts in German. Beyond that we are on our own. Neglecting to get it right may be due to carelessness. It can look like prejudice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alle Menschen werden Br\u00fcder - a reasonable sentiment, you might think, for a liberal newspaper to profess, but it would almost certainly be better if we skipped the German of Schiller's An die Freude and expressed our joy, even roughly, in English as, say, \"We are all in this together.\" We like to use foreign words, terms, phrases, but we often get them wrong. We even trip on common names, such as Giuseppe who regularly becomes Guiseppe - Gwee-seppy. Not long ago, to illustrate a point, we introduced a purely fictional Venezuelan maid into a story and called her Consuela. This brought a sharp note from a woman called, like thousands of other women in the Spanish-speaking world, Consuelo. \"I really have had enough of show-off ignoramuses messing up my name. Consuelo is a Spanish abstract noun, masculine, invariable. Pilar and Mercedes are also Spanish female names derived, like Consuelo, from titles of the Virgin Mary.\" It would be equally silly, she said, to stick an \"a\" on them. Names requiring accents seem to pose even greater difficulties. Extreme, and one has to say transparent, efforts are sometimes made to ensure that accents appear in the correct position. Alas, these efforts sometimes fail. They have caused us to refer to the soprano Christine Sch\u00e4fer as Christine Schumlautafer, and a work by Liszt became Funacuteerailles. The latter prompted a witty but wounding one-word rejoinder from a reader, \"Imbacuteeciles!\" Accent-induced anxiety is common among British journalists who find it difficult to understand why anyone should bother with such things. Foreign words that come into the English language bearing accents are stripped of them when the opportunity arises. Thus when I devoted a recent column to the clich\u00e9, you would have found when you picked the paper up on Saturday that I had been writing about the cliche, a deprivation let us concede more acute than grave. The tendency that it represents, although it may be seen by some as betraying our accents, is perhaps a good one. It is intended not as a slight - an act or omission indicating supercilious neglect or indifference (Collins) - aimed at a word's foreign origins, so much as an embrace or friendly adoption. Paradoxically the same anxiety I have mentioned often leads us to use accents like a condiment and to pepper foreign words with them more or less at random, so that readers who know about these things - a large, cosmopolitan and long-suffering congregation - have to ask us to desist. Here are just a couple of examples: The French word for a cluster of racing cyclists is peloton, not p\u00e9l\u00e9ton (It has nothing to do with a famous Brazilian footballer, this reader added, rather unnecessarily); Congratulations on getting L\u00e4nder right, another wrote, but the singular is Land not L\u00e4nd ... and so on. A recent article on French menus was returned marked in red ink by a reader with an indigestible total of more than 30 errors, most of them relating to missing or misplaced accents. We get worse as we move farther from Britain. We sometimes manage the diacritical tilde on Spanish words - ma\u00f1ana, for example - and sometimes not. For instance, a native or inhabitant of Madrid is a madrile\u00f1o/a, not a madrileno. During the World Cup coverage of 1998 a reader wrote to inquire why, since the Germans generally carried their umlauts proudly on to the pitch, and the French sometimes sported their accents, players of almost all other nationalities left theirs in the dressing room. M\u00f8ller was always Moller, the Argentine Ver\u00f3n and the Colombian Rinc\u00f3n stepped similarly naked on to the field. The Czech composers Jan\u00e1cek and Dvor\u00e1k may get their acute accents but the chances of parading the caron, the little v carried above the c and the r respectively, in the pages of the Guardian are practically nil because of technical difficulties. If you are Finnish, then, well, I am tempted to say forget it. We once misspelt the Finnish word for dyslexia (lukih\u00e4iri\u00f6). A few years ago we carried an article in translation from the Finnish daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The article was fine but the byline turned out to be not the name of the author but the Finnish for \"Continued on the next page\". Does any of this really matter? I think it does. I tend to agree with those readers who see it as a kind of parochialism detracting from their view of the Guardian as a paper with an unlimited horizon. Our style guide advises us only to keep all accents on French words and umlauts in German. Beyond that we are on our own. Neglecting to get it right may be due to carelessness. It can look like prejudice.",

      "body": "<b>Dear John,</b> <br> I'm sure that you and I agree on one thing: that it's quite wrong for employers to dismiss their employees unfairly, or to discriminate on grounds of race or gender. The system of employment tribunals is a good one and, in many cases, can right situations where employers have breached the rules. So why am I worried about the developments in compensation payouts that are now taking place? <p>Employees already bring many frivolous cases against employers. Taking average figures for recent years, I understand that about 45% of cases are either withdrawn before reaching the tribunal, or fail at the tribunal. In other words, nearly half of all the cases are frivolous, if not capricious. But, whether frivolous or not, the employer has to prepare his or her case, frequently incurring legal costs, in order to defend himself or herself. This can be hugely time-consuming, expensive and damaging, especially for small businesses. And there's no compensation for the employer if he or she \"wins\": today's compensation culture is strictly one-way.</p> <p>Given the explosion in employment regulations, media coverage of huge compensation payments and increasing litigiousness, I fear these frivolous cases will rise dramatically. How are employers - especially small employers - going to cope?</p> <p> Yours sincerely,<br> Ruth Lea<br> Head of Policy<br> Institute of Directors</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> You're right! I do agree that employers should obey the law. You're troubled by the burden on employers of frivolous employment tribunal cases. You have perhaps forgotten that an employment tribunal can and will order the costs of one side to be paid by the other where the latter has acted \"frivolously, vexatiously, abusively disruptively or otherwise unreasonably\". But two things trouble me about the special exemptions granted to employers, especially in the area of unfair dismissal. First, no matter how unfair the dismissal, an employee dismissed within a year of starting work with an employer is barred from bringing an unfair dismissal claim. Second, an employer cannot be obliged to take back an unfairly dismissed employee where a tribunal has ordered it. </p> <p>You refer to \"today's compensation culture\", but surely employers and their insurers must be rejoicing in the government's decision to abolish legal aid for personal injury cases? This will mean that thousands of workers will no longer be able to sue their employers for injury or death caused by breach of health and safety laws. True, unions will take these cases for free - as in the case of the Gypsy site worker who received damages this week - but most workers aren't in unions. Lawyers can do these cases on a no-win, no-fee basis, but they will only take the risk in the very strongest cases.</p> <p>You can rest assured that the courts and tribunals are assiduous in throwing out frivolous cases. The real injustice is not a compensation culture, but a culture in which innocent people suffer injury and loss by lawbreaking employers and yet cannot get compensation for it.</p> <p>Yours,<br> John Hendy QC<br> Institute of Employment Rights</p> <p><b>Dear John,</b><br> I hadn't forgotten that costs can be awarded to employers in some very specific circumstances, but such costs can never meet the damaging disruption to businesses - especially to small businesses - that frivolous cases cause. There is no adequate compensation for such damage. And the fact that tribunals are \"assiduous\" in throwing out frivolous cases does not invalidate this point.</p> <p>But the \"compensation culture\" is all too vigorous. Recent estimates suggest that it costs the country \u00a37.5bn a year, and some recent payouts have been extraordinarily inflated. Moreover, there has been an explosion of tribunal cases faced by employers. In 1998/99 there were 136,000; 31% higher than the previous year. As Acas has acknowledged, the rapid rise reflects increased litigiousness and extended employment rights, and there are more to come. Small employers feel powerless in the face of such an onslaught.</p> <p>As for industrial injuries cases, lawyers can do them on a no-win, no-fee basis, as indeed you say, insofar as public funding has been withdrawn for them. If lawyers believe a case has a good chance of winning then they would surely take it on. If not, it shouldn't go to court. If lawyers are responsible and rational people - and, in my experience, they are - then no innocent person who has suffered injury and loss by a lawbreaking employer should fail to get his or her compensation.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Ruth</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> You accept that tribunals throw out frivolous claims and that employers can get costs orders; remember also that tribunals can strike out vexatious claims at any stage. Employers are well-protected against the costs and disruption of fighting vexatious cases. What you're really seeking, it seems, is the removal of unfair dismissal claims altogether: that would certainly stop vexatious ones, but it would stop justified ones, too.</p> <p>I hope the lawbreaking of employers doesn't cost the country \u00a37.5bn a year! That cost should fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of employers who flout the law. The real significance of this figure - and of the increase in the number of cases fought and won- is that it shows the massive extent of bad employers. And don't forget that because of limits on compensation for unfair dismissal, redundancy, failures to consult and the like, \u00a37.5bn is nowhere near the total financial losses caused to employee victims. What your figure reveals is not a compensation culture, but a culture of lawlessness among employers.</p> <p>As for injury cases - yes, lawyers are rational people: they will not take on cases where they think there is a significant chance of not being paid. So injured people with good but not overwhelming cases - people, that is, with a 50-70% chance of success - will find it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get compensation.</p> <p>Yours,<br> John</p> <p><b>Dear John,</b><br> May I start by repeating that there is no adequate compensation for the damaging disruption caused to businesses, especially small ones, by frivolous tribunal cases. Every case has to be dealt with, and until the tribunal makes a decision, no businessman or woman knows whether or not it will be stopped. Coping with such cases can have huge opportunity costs, and almost cripple small and vulnerable firms. Incidentally, you imply I am seeking the removal of all claims. Not so.</p> <p>Concerning the \u00a37.5bn, I'm afraid you misunderstood the nature of the figure. It refers to the total costs to the country of the compensation culture, and includes \u00a34bn paid by the NHS, emergency services and local government. Legal fees totalled \u00a31bn - a nice little earner! - and less than 20% was attributed to the private sector, hardly a culture of lawlessness among employers.</p> <p>I was surprised, if not amazed, that you implied that only dead cert cases - or near as dammit dead cert - would be handled by lawyers. Such a stance seems quite extraordinarily restrictive and unjust. Some people may think lawyers should adopt a less risk-averse - and more generous - approach.</p> <p>Yours,<br> Ruth</p> <p><b>Dear Ruth,</b><br> You complain of inadequate compensation for employers faced with frivolous cases, but I've spent nearly 30 years doing employment cases and I just do not believe there are many frivolous ones. The fact that many cases are withdrawn before hearing is because settlement is often reached, frequently when the employer agrees to pay because the employee's case is strong. And the disruption caused by claims against employers is nowhere near comparable to the distress caused to employees who are unfairly treated.</p> <p>I don't understand your figure of \u00a37.5bn as the cost of the \"compensation culture\". Compensation is only payable when someone has broken the law; if you break the law and someone else suffers loss, or is injured, why shouldn't you pay compensation? I find it hard to believe that the NHS, emergency services and local government have paid out \u00a34bn in compensation and costs for their own wrongdoing. Maybe you are referring to the cost of attending to accidents in which compensation has later been recovered by victims; if so, I agree that the wrongdoer should compensate those bodies too.</p> <p>In 1994, the health and safety executive estimated that the net cost to individuals of work-related accidents and ill-health was \u00a35bn; the cost to employers \u00a31.5bn. The cost to society was between \u00a311bn and \u00a316bn. It would be much better economics for employers to comply with law than to whinge about frivolous tribunal cases. Many lawyers take many deserving cases in tribunals and courts free of charge, but you can't expect them to run their businesses at a loss. Wasn't your starting point the need to protect small businesses from irrecoverable costs?</p> <p>Yours,<br> John </p> <p><a href=\"http://talk.newsunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee711f2\">Join the debate</a></p>",

In 1994, the health and safety executive estimated that the net cost to individuals of work-related accidents and ill-health was \u00a35bn; the cost to employers \u00a31.5bn. The cost to society was between \u00a311bn and \u00a316bn. It would be much better economics for employers to comply with law than to whinge about frivolous tribunal cases. Many lawyers take many deserving cases in tribunals and courts free of charge, but you can't expect them to run their businesses at a loss. Wasn't your starting point the need to protect small businesses from irrecoverable costs? Yours, John Join the debate",

      "body": "<p>Christopher Eccleston is Eeyore with sex appeal. Famously glum, he's rangy, a Sunday footballer, a marathon runner. He's also thoughtful and intense. Imagine a sports master who is also a keen vegetarian. He's taking a break from filming an episode of a new BBC drama called Clocking Off and he talks cautiously, weighing his words with care. Yet his flies are undone, and he hasn't noticed. And it's a real surprise when he laughs. It's not loud, but his eyes flash. And it's even more of a surprise that he's talking about his work, his family, and himself at all. In fact, it's something of a shock that he's so thoroughly engaging. </p> <p>Buttoned-up, miseryguts Eccleston, the working-class boy from Eccles, has always allowed his bone structure to cast him as moody and broody, and people presume he's like that off screen. He's been drawn towards characters who are in conflict, sometimes dour - even psychotic, such as David, in the homicidal chill of Shallow Grave, one of his early successes. Under Danny Boyle's direction, he created a tension in front of the camera that carried the film beyond the appearance of normality and into terror. It was as if he was acting behind his eyes. </p> <p>As Trevor Hicks, in the 1996 TV docu-drama Hillsborough, by Jimmy McGovern, one of his favourite writers, he showed a man trying to rescue what was left of his life, his marriage and his pride after losing two daughters in the football stadium disaster. Eccleston painted Hicks, one of the leaders of the families' campaign for justice, as an honest man defeated by his own strained pragmatism. There were rages, icy drafts of grief, tears and but precious few laughs. As he says now, \"There was no real room for custard pies.\" Then there was Jude - pale-faced, ardent Jude opposite Kate Winslett in Michael Winterbottom's adaptation of Hardy's novel - the struggling peasant boy trying to better himself. </p> <p>The men in Eccleston's gallery of performances have not been happy. Even DCI Billborough, sidekick to Robbie Coltrane's increasingly eccentric Cracker, lived moodily and died tragically. And Eccleston reached a peak of agonising manhood with probably his best performance to date, Nicky in Our Friends In The North. A zealous idealist, he finds himself, in his 40s, burnt out with a cynicism that was, in the end, created by nothing more basic than an inability to be reconciled with his father. The emptiness in his eyes was disillusion incarnate. </p> <p>So, on screen Eccleston has turned in a powerful line of men in conflict searching for some settlement with their world and their lack of power. And he's appeared to play the part off screen, too, unbending and uncommunicative. Until now. And there's not exactly a confessional torrent, more a quiet, good-humoured, tentative opening of a door to his passions. \"I suppose I've relaxed a bit. Actually, I bloody hate my work. I'm not happy with it. I feel very limited as an actor. And early on I was pigeonholed, so I wouldn't talk about these things.\" And he says - a number of times - \"I've felt a bit lost for a while now. Ever since Hillsborough, I've been doing things, work, that I wouldn't normally have done.\" </p> <p>He won't be specific, but he must be talking about films such as Elizabeth, in which he played the Duke of Norfolk. It's not that he has a problem with doing costume drama - \"I'd have a go at a 19th-century, cross-dressing aristocratic poet if I was asked: I might not pull it off, but I'd learn\" - but in Elizabeth he seemed to be making the most of a part that was written as a one-dimensional villain, lacking any psychological motivation. Eccleston won't amplify, remaining tactfully vague. </p> <p>In his episode of Clocking Off he plays \"a 35-year-old bloke who's shagging his brains out\". Then he meets a single woman with kids and eventually falls...well, you can guess how it goes. It's a bit of a change for him, almost a light romantic role. \"When I read it, I thought it was really good. And also I needed the work,\" he says. \"I also thought it would be nice to be playful, not conflicted. It's good if it confounds a few perceptions of me.\" In the series, written by Paul Abbott (who wrote Cracker after Jimmy McGovern invented it), each programme focuses on the life of one of several people who work in a textile factory. Eccleston agreed to do it because Paul Abbott's writing \"captures the rhythms of working-class people without camping it up\". And so it does. It's the very best of that kind of television. Or if you hate the McGovern/Bleasdale school of TV drama, it's \"self-indulgent sentimentality, revealing the kind of worship of the working class that only writers who are successful and rich enough to have escaped their roots can feel\" - that from a well-known working-class writer, who, for reasons of professional politeness, wished to remain unnamed. </p> <p>Whatever, Eccleston, who is much associated with McGovern, has become the epitome of Conscience in his acting. That is what makes him more than his own assessment of himself as \"a good, middle-range actor\" - and may also drive him into a cul-de-sac of typecasting. For my money, Clocking Off has a sparkling economy in its writing and manages to dignify its characters with a complexity that, in his worst moments, escapes McGovern's maudlin over-romanticism of working-class families. It is also my guess that Eccleston will not remain stuck where he is. He is far too versatile an actor, even if few have bothered to notice. </p> <p> To Eccleston, all this is very important. \"The work I have chosen to do has meant that I have played a lot of conflicted people. That comes out of my conviction that what's on our TV screens should be of value.\" He quotes Hardy later on, from the beginning of Far From The Madding Crowd. \" 'In short he was a man of salt and pepper mixture. On a good day he was a good man and on a bad day he was a bad man.' And I went for that, because it means playing a character with all the contradictions and grey areas, and it has an integrity in the way it is depicted...A lot of my work comes from my responsibility to my family and what we believe in and what I was taught.\" And that - family - is the crux of it. His attitude to his work was born with his first screen job in the late 80s, playing Derek Bentley - the teenager who, in the 50s, was hanged for killing a policeman, and now pardoned - in a film called Let Him Have It. </p> <p>\"I was very naive, and I had done only a couple of theatre jobs and I got this telly job because I was a nobody. And there was a big fuss about it, of course, with my friends and family. But in the middle of shooting, I started to listen to the dialogue and how the characters were being made to talk and relate to each other by the director. At the same time, I had researched learning disability and epilepsy - which was Derek Bentley's problem - and I had some instincts about how that should be presented. I found myself growing very uncomfortable with the way I was being asked to portray the learning disability...specifically romanticised chirpy, cheekie cockney. Really ladling on the pathos. I was surprised how much it upset me. I remember it making me very angry, because I thought it's not like that. They're not just telling lies about people whom I know but they're making value judgments about their audience.\" He is warming up now. \"Okay, Bentley was retarded, but it ain't sweet. Does it feel sweet to the person themself to have a learning disability? I saw two very clear paths. The blue-eyed pathos thing, very lovable and cute, or the other road, which is being truthful. And I took that road.\" </p> <p>Why didn't he just take the money and shut up? Why did he choose to be so challenging on set. \"I didn't feel I was making a choice. It was a compulsion. I did think, 'Why not keep your mouth shut, kid?' I mean, I was an absolute nobody from nowhere. But I said, 'No, I'm not doing it.'\" So who, or what, taught him to be like that? His parents? Pause. Temporary shut-down. Prodded, he starts to talk. \"What my dad taught me was whatever job you do, do the best that you can, and for me that means giving a character their dignity, even if it's undignified. Give them their truth. It all comes from my parents. My inability to keep my mouth shut and take the money all comes from my parents.\" </p> <p>Eccleston was born in 1964, near Manchester. He's one of three boys, the youngest by eight years. The other two are a builder and an upholsterer, who both now work in television and film. \"They were,\" Eccleston says, \"both manually very accomplished.\" He, on the other hand, was hopeless. \"Every time I look at a piece of machinery, it blows up.\" He often makes a comparison between his work and theirs. \"My brother makes very good furniture, and I want to see if I can make very good performances.\" Someone once said to his father, 70 this year, \"You must be very proud of your son.\" And his dad replied, vehemently, \"I'm very proud of all my sons.\" </p> <p>\"That's the kind of fairness I was brought up with,\" says Eccleston. As a child, he played a lot of sports, \"and when I got fouled and the referee didn't call it, I'd go wild and I'd get myself involved in monster fights. I'd get out of the showers and they'd be there waiting. Because there was something to tussle over. I suppose I've always been like that.\" Although later, he also says, \"I've never really been a bad boy. I can't fight my way out of a paper bag.\" It was ever thus with the youngest - especially boys with older brothers - they talk big, but they're soft as butter. </p> <p>His mother and father were both manual workers. \"I used to watch my mum and dad go out at 8am and then come home at six and go out again at eight in the morning. That was one of the things that made me want to be an actor, to avoid routine, the routine that I saw grind my mum and dad down a bit. I think they feel that, intellectually and emotionally, they've been under-used by the jobs they have done. And it all got poured into us, the family, which was great for us. In fact, a lot of the men on the estate, not just my dad, were in repetitive work, not very demanding...\" he checks himself \"...though not to undervalue what they did.\" Then he pauses. \"I wanted a job that I didn't hate.\" Half-an-hour before, he had said, with such finality, \"At the moment, I bloody hate my work.\" He smiles wryly. </p> <p>He left school without any qualifications because he was \"a lazy bugger and didn't apply myself\". So he went to sixth-form college in Eccles to re-sit all his exams, and failed them all again. But it was a very different atmosphere, \"because everybody wanted to learn. And I came out of myself and turned into a bit of a loon.\" Then he went to Salford Tech, and someone put him in a play. \"I think they just needed a big lad. Although,\" he says quite rightly, \"I think, if I'm honest, what I always had was a physical presence.\" </p> <p>The play was Lock Up Your Daughters, and he was completely miscast as a romantic lead. \"All my energy went like that,\" he says, indicating a tight, rolled-up ball, \"because I was terrified.\" The play was not particularly important, but Mrs Sorah was. She was the English teacher. \"A few of them thought she was a bit of a cow. But she wasn't afraid to show her feelings about the things that we read. I took her on, in a way. She taught with a passion. And she taught us about Sassoon and the other war poets. And his journey, his act of conscience, was very striking to me. He started writing poetry that was a call to arms, published in the Daily Telegraph. And then, two years later (1917), he was writing Blighters, about the return to England and sitting in a music hall watching them do a sketch about the war.\" </p> <p> I'd like to see a Tank come down the stalls, </p> <p>Lurching to rag-time tunes, or 'Home Sweet Home', - </p> <p>And there'd be no more jokes in Music-halls </p> <p>To mock the riddled corpses round Bapaume. </p> <p>\"Poetry and classical music had always seemed rather frivolous, but these were poems, art, that had come out of something very essential and that captured my imagination. These blokes went to war and they felt compelled to write about their experiences.\" </p> <p>After Salford Tech, much to everyone's surprise, he got a place at Central School Of Speech And Drama. But, after graduating, he didn't really work for three years until Let Him Have It. Since then, he has been most noticeably in the business of portraying working-class men with a sense of truthfulness. \"I remember being transfixed by the opening shots of Kes. It looked like our street, the same light as when you were doing your paper round.\" His desire for truth seems to come not from anger about his roots, quite the reverse. \"I saw a value in our life,\" he says, \"I was just very loved, really. You'd have to ask them if they think of me as different. But I feel a lot closer to them when something like Hillsborough gets a response because I think it's probably important to my mum and dad and brothers that I'm not pissing about doing No\u00ebl Coward. It's probably important to them that people tell them they saw Hillsborough last night...that it was something of value.\" </p> <p>He also grew up with that generation of dramatists - Alan Bleasdale, Alan Clarke, Ken Loach - on his TV screen, who made it their life's work to show the reality of the lives of \"the many not the few\". And he's aware of how the impact of performances ripples out far more from TV than from theatre. Despite the excitement it might generate, he has never - at least until now - engaged with the idea that theatre could be interesting as a future direction for him. \"I was an usher at the National Theatre, when I was a student, and I wanted to borrow Siegfried Sassoon's tank and roll right over the audience.\" This is said with not the slightest levity. And it kick-starts an outburst about ticket prices, preaching to the converted, how Shakespeare should be banned for a while and all the money given to theatre-in-education groups to tour the regions, etc, punctuated only by a brief shared memory of Michael Gambon's towering performance as Eddie Carbone in Alan Ayckbourn's production of Arthur Miller's View From The Bridge at the National Theatre in 1987. \"I remember the young girl first walking into Eddie's house, and this huge man registering his desire by jumping up and sitting on the sideboard like an adolescent.\" He says, admiringly, \"Gambon has an extraordinary emotional range.\" Even if he'd like to firebomb the National, Eccleston can't help revealing, as he says later, that he is \"fascinated by acting...absolutely fascinated by it\". </p> <p> And he will have the opportunity to put his doubts and suspicions about theatre to the test in February, when he will play Jean in a West End production of a new translation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, by Frank McGinnis. \"Well, the pressure's on now,\" he says laughing. \"And it's totally hypocritical of me, really, after all the abuse I've given theatre in the past. But I'm doing this for myself. The kind of people who watch Jimmy McGovern's stuff on telly won't be coming, and the tickets at the Theatre Royal will be expensive. But it will give me a chance to rehearse a character for four weeks, not go to work until 7.30pm every day, and not have someone shout 'cut' every two minutes.\" </p> <p>And the intensity of Strindberg will suit his style. In Jean, he gets to play a working-class butler, who \"shags the head of the house\" and drives her to suicide in order to protect himself. Eccleston used to think Strindberg melodramatic, until he met some friends of an old girlfriend. \"They were a married couple who had a real relationship of complete mutual dependency and mutual hatred.\" So, despite this being in the West End, maybe it will be another bit of Eccleston's truthful realism, rather than standard posh theatre. </p> <p>Anyway, theatre for him is less about theatre than it is about what he wants to see on TV. \"I hope that someone from a council estate like me watches what I and others do and says, 'That's my life; that's my accent; I have those problems with my dad or my mates.' Jimmy McGovern writes for the telly because he doesn't see his audience in the theatre.\" Eccleston wants to be part of \"a revolution on British television that went back to the Monday Play and Play For Today that created the impressions that I got as a youngster. It would be great to get back to quality drama on TV and away from formulaic, star-driven stuff. Rather than what can we put x, y or z in, it should be, 'What does Jimmy McGovern want to write about?'\" Eccleston even says, a little whimsically, \"Sometimes, when I have sat at home feeling under-used as an actor, I've thought that I should contact Channel 4 and try and create a rep system of actors and writers and bring back Play For Today. Maybe not as an actor, but as a producer.\" He probably won't do it, because actors are actors and producers are producers, and they are, by and large, very different animals. But what he has to say is more than a whinge. It is a passion. </p> <p>Eccleston has had time for these thoughts because, over the past year or so, he has sat at home quite a lot; he admits to having taken several jobs \"just to get me out of the house\". He didn't work for nine months until August 1998. Then he had seven weeks on a film and didn't work again until May of last year, when he did another film, this time with Michael Winterbottom, the director of Jude, called With Or Without You. \"Not working for so long was the worst time of my life.\" To add to that he has recently had a major disappointment: he and a well-known French director called it a day on a project he's passionate about. \"I want this more than anything I ever wanted.\" This from a man who doesn't speak hyperbole, even as a second language. </p> <p>But he's not exactly either poor or forgotten, even if, at the moment, few projects measure up to his vision of what he'd like to do. And three years ago he moved back to Eccles and bought a house. He did it on impulse. He had ended a relationship and realised that, as he got older, he wanted to be near his family again. They are \"pretty realistic about unemployment\". And he never really worked in London anyway. </p> <p>Over recent months he has been working on an American indie film called Invisible Circus, with Cameron Diaz, whom he describes as \"a really truthful actor who really does just go off wherever she is taken... totally generous\", and a television project called Killing Time, which was broadcast on New Year's Day. It was a collaboration with Simon Armitage, the poet from Yorkshire, and a director called Brian Hill, who's from Rochdale. Aah, the comfort of fellow northerners. \"Brian and I started off with one of those 'my council estate is rougher than your council estate' kind of conversations, and then we just got on with it.\" It was a two-handed documentary, linked with a poem by Armitage, in which Eccleston and Hermione Norris - \"the blonde one in Cold Feet\" - played Millennium Man and Millennium Woman. They went around the country, speaking to people who then gave them objects for a Millennium Bonfire. </p> <p>It was, he says, a \"genuine piece of collaboration. We shaped it together. This one woman, who had just had a child, gave away a cocktail dress to symbolise the end of that part of her life. And a farmer, who'd had to sell up his farm because of BSE, gave me a rib of beef. I was off-script when we weren't doing the poem, and I loved it. I spent a lot of the time being me. It was a lot more exposing because it wasn't a character. It was my way of speaking, my interests.\" And it wasn't moody, either. Perhaps, some teenager in a council estate in Eccles saw it, and it will change their life. Like telly changed Eccleston's. But I wonder what his family thought. Because that's what really seems to matter the most </p> <p>\u0095 Clocking Off begins on BBC1 on January 23.

And early on I was pigeonholed, so I wouldn't talk about these things.\" And he says - a number of times - \"I've felt a bit lost for a while now. Ever since Hillsborough, I've been doing things, work, that I wouldn't normally have done.\" He won't be specific, but he must be talking about films such as Elizabeth, in which he played the Duke of Norfolk. It's not that he has a problem with doing costume drama - \"I'd have a go at a 19th-century, cross-dressing aristocratic poet if I was asked: I might not pull it off, but I'd learn\" - but in Elizabeth he seemed to be making the most of a part that was written as a one-dimensional villain, lacking any psychological motivation. Eccleston won't amplify, remaining tactfully vague. In his episode of Clocking Off he plays \"a 35-year-old bloke who's shagging his brains out\". Then he meets a single woman with kids and eventually falls...well, you can guess how it goes. It's a bit of a change for him, almost a light romantic role. \"When I read it, I thought it was really good. And also I needed the work,\" he says. \"I also thought it would be nice to be playful, not conflicted. It's good if it confounds a few perceptions of me.\" In the series, written by Paul Abbott (who wrote Cracker after Jimmy McGovern invented it), each programme focuses on the life of one of several people who work in a textile factory. Eccleston agreed to do it because Paul Abbott's writing \"captures the rhythms of working-class people without camping it up\". And so it does. It's the very best of that kind of television. Or if you hate the McGovern/Bleasdale school of TV drama, it's \"self-indulgent sentimentality, revealing the kind of worship of the working class that only writers who are successful and rich enough to have escaped their roots can feel\" - that from a well-known working-class writer, who, for reasons of professional politeness, wished to remain unnamed. Whatever, Eccleston, who is much associated with McGovern, has become the epitome of Conscience in his acting. That is what makes him more than his own assessment of himself as \"a good, middle-range actor\" - and may also drive him into a cul-de-sac of typecasting. For my money, Clocking Off has a sparkling economy in its writing and manages to dignify its characters with a complexity that, in his worst moments, escapes McGovern's maudlin over-romanticism of working-class families. It is also my guess that Eccleston will not remain stuck where he is. He is far too versatile an actor, even if few have bothered to notice. To Eccleston, all this is very important. \"The work I have chosen to do has meant that I have played a lot of conflicted people. That comes out of my conviction that what's on our TV screens should be of value.\" He quotes Hardy later on, from the beginning of Far From The Madding Crowd. \" 'In short he was a man of salt and pepper mixture. On a good day he was a good man and on a bad day he was a bad man.' And I went for that, because it means playing a character with all the contradictions and grey areas, and it has an integrity in the way it is depicted...A lot of my work comes from my responsibility to my family and what we believe in and what I was taught.\" And that - family - is the crux of it. His attitude to his work was born with his first screen job in the late 80s, playing Derek Bentley - the teenager who, in the 50s, was hanged for killing a policeman, and now pardoned - in a film called Let Him Have It. \"I was very naive, and I had done only a couple of theatre jobs and I got this telly job because I was a nobody. And there was a big fuss about it, of course, with my friends and family. But in the middle of shooting, I started to listen to the dialogue and how the characters were being made to talk and relate to each other by the director. At the same time, I had researched learning disability and epilepsy - which was Derek Bentley's problem - and I had some instincts about how that should be presented. I found myself growing very uncomfortable with the way I was being asked to portray the learning disability...specifically romanticised chirpy, cheekie cockney. Really ladling on the pathos. I was surprised how much it upset me. I remember it making me very angry, because I thought it's not like that. They're not just telling lies about people whom I know but they're making value judgments about their audience.\" He is warming up now. \"Okay, Bentley was retarded, but it ain't sweet. Does it feel sweet to the person themself to have a learning disability? I saw two very clear paths. The blue-eyed pathos thing, very lovable and cute, or the other road, which is being truthful. And I took that road.\" Why didn't he just take the money and shut up? Why did he choose to be so challenging on set. \"I didn't feel I was making a choice. It was a compulsion. I did think, 'Why not keep your mouth shut, kid?' I mean, I was an absolute nobody from nowhere. But I said, 'No, I'm not doing it.'\" So who, or what, taught him to be like that? His parents? Pause. Temporary shut-down. Prodded, he starts to talk. \"What my dad taught me was whatever job you do, do the best that you can, and for me that means giving a character their dignity, even if it's undignified. Give them their truth. It all comes from my parents. My inability to keep my mouth shut and take the money all comes from my parents.\" Eccleston was born in 1964, near Manchester. He's one of three boys, the youngest by eight years. The other two are a builder and an upholsterer, who both now work in television and film. \"They were,\" Eccleston says, \"both manually very accomplished.\" He, on the other hand, was hopeless. \"Every time I look at a piece of machinery, it blows up.\" He often makes a comparison between his work and theirs. \"My brother makes very good furniture, and I want to see if I can make very good performances.\" Someone once said to his father, 70 this year, \"You must be very proud of your son.\" And his dad replied, vehemently, \"I'm very proud of all my sons.\" \"That's the kind of fairness I was brought up with,\" says Eccleston. As a child, he played a lot of sports, \"and when I got fouled and the referee didn't call it, I'd go wild and I'd get myself involved in monster fights. I'd get out of the showers and they'd be there waiting. Because there was something to tussle over. I suppose I've always been like that.\" Although later, he also says, \"I've never really been a bad boy. I can't fight my way out of a paper bag.\" It was ever thus with the youngest - especially boys with older brothers - they talk big, but they're soft as butter. His mother and father were both manual workers. \"I used to watch my mum and dad go out at 8am and then come home at six and go out again at eight in the morning. That was one of the things that made me want to be an actor, to avoid routine, the routine that I saw grind my mum and dad down a bit. I think they feel that, intellectually and emotionally, they've been under-used by the jobs they have done. And it all got poured into us, the family, which was great for us. In fact, a lot of the men on the estate, not just my dad, were in repetitive work, not very demanding...\" he checks himself \"...though not to undervalue what they did.\" Then he pauses. \"I wanted a job that I didn't hate.\" Half-an-hour before, he had said, with such finality, \"At the moment, I bloody hate my work.\" He smiles wryly. He left school without any qualifications because he was \"a lazy bugger and didn't apply myself\". So he went to sixth-form college in Eccles to re-sit all his exams, and failed them all again. But it was a very different atmosphere, \"because everybody wanted to learn. And I came out of myself and turned into a bit of a loon.\" Then he went to Salford Tech, and someone put him in a play. \"I think they just needed a big lad. Although,\" he says quite rightly, \"I think, if I'm honest, what I always had was a physical presence.\" The play was Lock Up Your Daughters, and he was completely miscast as a romantic lead. \"All my energy went like that,\" he says, indicating a tight, rolled-up ball, \"because I was terrified.\" The play was not particularly important, but Mrs Sorah was. She was the English teacher. \"A few of them thought she was a bit of a cow. But she wasn't afraid to show her feelings about the things that we read. I took her on, in a way. She taught with a passion. And she taught us about Sassoon and the other war poets. And his journey, his act of conscience, was very striking to me. He started writing poetry that was a call to arms, published in the Daily Telegraph. And then, two years later (1917), he was writing Blighters, about the return to England and sitting in a music hall watching them do a sketch about the war.\" I'd like to see a Tank come down the stalls, Lurching to rag-time tunes, or 'Home Sweet Home', - And there'd be no more jokes in Music-halls To mock the riddled corpses round Bapaume. \"Poetry and classical music had always seemed rather frivolous, but these were poems, art, that had come out of something very essential and that captured my imagination. These blokes went to war and they felt compelled to write about their experiences.\" After Salford Tech, much to everyone's surprise, he got a place at Central School Of Speech And Drama. But, after graduating, he didn't really work for three years until Let Him Have It. Since then, he has been most noticeably in the business of portraying working-class men with a sense of truthfulness. \"I remember being transfixed by the opening shots of Kes. It looked like our street, the same light as when you were doing your paper round.\" His desire for truth seems to come not from anger about his roots, quite the reverse. \"I saw a value in our life,\" he says, \"I was just very loved, really. You'd have to ask them if they think of me as different. But I feel a lot closer to them when something like Hillsborough gets a response because I think it's probably important to my mum and dad and brothers that I'm not pissing about doing No\u00ebl Coward. It's probably important to them that people tell them they saw Hillsborough last night...that it was something of value.\" He also grew up with that generation of dramatists - Alan Bleasdale, Alan Clarke, Ken Loach - on his TV screen, who made it their life's work to show the reality of the lives of \"the many not the few\". And he's aware of how the impact of performances ripples out far more from TV than from theatre. Despite the excitement it might generate, he has never - at least until now - engaged with the idea that theatre could be interesting as a future direction for him. \"I was an usher at the National Theatre, when I was a student, and I wanted to borrow Siegfried Sassoon's tank and roll right over the audience.\" This is said with not the slightest levity. And it kick-starts an outburst about ticket prices, preaching to the converted, how Shakespeare should be banned for a while and all the money given to theatre-in-education groups to tour the regions, etc, punctuated only by a brief shared memory of Michael Gambon's towering performance as Eddie Carbone in Alan Ayckbourn's production of Arthur Miller's View From The Bridge at the National Theatre in 1987. \"I remember the young girl first walking into Eddie's house, and this huge man registering his desire by jumping up and sitting on the sideboard like an adolescent.\" He says, admiringly, \"Gambon has an extraordinary emotional range.\" Even if he'd like to firebomb the National, Eccleston can't help revealing, as he says later, that he is \"fascinated by acting...absolutely fascinated by it\". And he will have the opportunity to put his doubts and suspicions about theatre to the test in February, when he will play Jean in a West End production of a new translation of Strindberg's Miss Julie, by Frank McGinnis. \"Well, the pressure's on now,\" he says laughing. \"And it's totally hypocritical of me, really, after all the abuse I've given theatre in the past. But I'm doing this for myself. The kind of people who watch Jimmy McGovern's stuff on telly won't be coming, and the tickets at the Theatre Royal will be expensive. But it will give me a chance to rehearse a character for four weeks, not go to work until 7.30pm every day, and not have someone shout 'cut' every two minutes.\" And the intensity of Strindberg will suit his style. In Jean, he gets to play a working-class butler, who \"shags the head of the house\" and drives her to suicide in order to protect himself. Eccleston used to think Strindberg melodramatic, until he met some friends of an old girlfriend. \"They were a married couple who had a real relationship of complete mutual dependency and mutual hatred.\" So, despite this being in the West End, maybe it will be another bit of Eccleston's truthful realism, rather than standard posh theatre. Anyway, theatre for him is less about theatre than it is about what he wants to see on TV. \"I hope that someone from a council estate like me watches what I and others do and says, 'That's my life; that's my accent; I have those problems with my dad or my mates.' Jimmy McGovern writes for the telly because he doesn't see his audience in the theatre.\" Eccleston wants to be part of \"a revolution on British television that went back to the Monday Play and Play For Today that created the impressions that I got as a youngster. It would be great to get back to quality drama on TV and away from formulaic, star-driven stuff. Rather than what can we put x, y or z in, it should be, 'What does Jimmy McGovern want to write about?'\" Eccleston even says, a little whimsically, \"Sometimes, when I have sat at home feeling under-used as an actor, I've thought that I should contact Channel 4 and try and create a rep system of actors and writers and bring back Play For Today. Maybe not as an actor, but as a producer.\" He probably won't do it, because actors are actors and producers are producers, and they are, by and large, very different animals. But what he has to say is more than a whinge. It is a passion. Eccleston has had time for these thoughts because, over the past year or so, he has sat at home quite a lot; he admits to having taken several jobs \"just to get me out of the house\". He didn't work for nine months until August 1998. Then he had seven weeks on a film and didn't work again until May of last year, when he did another film, this time with Michael Winterbottom, the director of Jude, called With Or Without You. \"Not working for so long was the worst time of my life.\" To add to that he has recently had a major disappointment: he and a well-known French director called it a day on a project he's passionate about. \"I want this more than anything I ever wanted.\" This from a man who doesn't speak hyperbole, even as a second language. But he's not exactly either poor or forgotten, even if, at the moment, few projects measure up to his vision of what he'd like to do. And three years ago he moved back to Eccles and bought a house. He did it on impulse. He had ended a relationship and realised that, as he got older, he wanted to be near his family again. They are \"pretty realistic about unemployment\". And he never really worked in London anyway. Over recent months he has been working on an American indie film called Invisible Circus, with Cameron Diaz, whom he describes as \"a really truthful actor who really does just go off wherever she is taken... totally generous\", and a television project called Killing Time, which was broadcast on New Year's Day. It was a collaboration with Simon Armitage, the poet from Yorkshire, and a director called Brian Hill, who's from Rochdale. Aah, the comfort of fellow northerners. \"Brian and I started off with one of those 'my council estate is rougher than your council estate' kind of conversations, and then we just got on with it.\" It was a two-handed documentary, linked with a poem by Armitage, in which Eccleston and Hermione Norris - \"the blonde one in Cold Feet\" - played Millennium Man and Millennium Woman. They went around the country, speaking to people who then gave them objects for a Millennium Bonfire. It was, he says, a \"genuine piece of collaboration. We shaped it together. This one woman, who had just had a child, gave away a cocktail dress to symbolise the end of that part of her life. And a farmer, who'd had to sell up his farm because of BSE, gave me a rib of beef. I was off-script when we weren't doing the poem, and I loved it. I spent a lot of the time being me. It was a lot more exposing because it wasn't a character. It was my way of speaking, my interests.\" And it wasn't moody, either. Perhaps, some teenager in a council estate in Eccles saw it, and it will change their life. Like telly changed Eccleston's. But I wonder what his family thought. Because that's what really seems to matter the most \u0095 Clocking Off begins on BBC1 on January 23. Miss Julie is at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, from February 29.

      "body": "<p>When Jack Straw was asked this week if he wasn't having a bit of hard time, he smiled, and replied: \"I have no complaints at all. I sleep well. I eat well and I go to the gym very regularly. Thank you very much.\"</p> <p>As it turned out Mr Straw wasn't in training to take on Mike Tyson but it was certainly a week in which the sheer pace of events left even his heavyweight political act looking slightly frayed at the edges.</p> <p>It started with rows over the home secretary's thoughts on the character of the English and the failings of Hampstead liberals, moved on to the controversy over his decision to allow General Pinochet to return to Chile, before ending in a big battle over his plans for jury trials and the debacle over Tyson's entry to Britain.</p> <p>By his own estimation Jack Straw has just faced his most testing week as home secretary since the publication of the Lawrence inquiry report nearly a year ago. It was the sheer range of issues involved that was so difficult, and which left Radio 4's Today programme sounding like the Jack Straw show.</p> <p>\"Do things ever go well at the home office?,\" sighed a source close to Mr Straw when asked for his verdict on the week.</p> <p>Mr Straw had enjoyed a relatively quiet Christmas and new year break. As one senior home office civil servant put it: \"My heart missed a beat when I turned on the radio and heard there had been a prison breakout, but it turned out that it was in Paraguay.\"</p> <p>The only issue to really trouble Mr Straw over the long break was what to do about Kalejs, the alleged Nazi war criminal, who had been discovered to be living in Britain. That did not go too well with home office sources privately admitting that it would have been better if the police could have been persuaded to hold a press conference explaining exactly what the difficulties were in gathering the evidence against him before he left for Australia under the threat of deportation.</p> <p><b> Fancy footwork</b><br></p> <p>It is not without irony that Mr Straw said that \"with hindsight\" Kalejs's name should have been on the immigration service's 500,000 strong \"suspects' index\" which might have prevented him getting into the country in the first place - although as we now know that is a rule which is applied, at least in the case of heavyweight boxers, with some flexibility.</p> <p>It has been said that being home secretary is the kind of occupation in which you are walking down the street in glorious sunshine and without a cloud in the sky one moment, only to find yourself soaked through and dashing for the shelter of the nearest doorway by the time you reach the first corner.</p> <p>Most politicians find it impossible to cope with these sudden political storms, which is one reason why few home secretaries last more than a year or two in the job. The last Tory government went through four home secretaries in four years, including Ken Baker and David Waddington. But Jack Straw, like his predecessor, Michael Howard, seems to positively thrive on these political confrontations to such a degree that it would not be surprising to learn that he regularly hums Singin' in the Rain in the bath.</p> <p>But this week has underlined one crucial difference between Michael Howard and Jack Straw. Mr Howard, partly driven by ideological determination, would doggedly stick with whatever decision he had made regardless of all the available evidence. Mr Straw, however, has got the speed and fancy footwork needed to undertake the crucial U-turns whenever they are necessary to avert political disaster. His trick is to go around being brutally honest about it and not pretending that he hasn't changed his mind.</p> <p>So we saw a home secretary who, at the beginning of the week could not possibly intervene in the immigration service's decision not to allow Mike Tyson to enter Britain as a convicted rapist, take the \"courageous decision\" on Thursday to let him in because of the \"exceptional circumstances\" that some small traders in Manchester could face bankruptcy and that thousands of boxing fans who had bought tickets would be disappointed.</p> <p>It was, apparently, only when further legal advice arrived on Wednesday at the same time as a 67-page submission from the fight promoter, Frank Warren, that it became clear the home secretary could override the immigration service's view that Tyson would not be allowed in when he arrived.</p> <p>The decision over General Pinochet was in some ways easier for Mr Straw. All he did was follow the procedure set out in the extradition law to the letter.</p> <p>As even Michael Howard conceded this week, Straw was in a political \"lose, lose\" situation over the Pinochet decision as the threat of action by the high court judges was always a more potent factor in his mind than the politics of the Labour party.</p> <p>Those closest to him believe that most of his Labour critics at Westminster accept that the medical reports show that the decision that the former Chilean dictator was unfit to stand trial was the right one.</p> <p><b> Rumblings of anger</b><br></p> <p>But as a couple of Commons early day motions testify, the rumblings of anger continue and not just among the usual suspects of the Labour hard left. As Mr Straw pointed out to his \"liberal left\" critics on Thursday in his speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research: \"Labour home secretaries are always bound to be damned from both sides.\"</p> <p>But as the pace of the week's events got ever faster, some of the footwork started to look distinctly dodgy.

      "bodyText": "When Jack Straw was asked this week if he wasn't having a bit of hard time, he smiled, and replied: \"I have no complaints at all. I sleep well. I eat well and I go to the gym very regularly. Thank you very much.\" As it turned out Mr Straw wasn't in training to take on Mike Tyson but it was certainly a week in which the sheer pace of events left even his heavyweight political act looking slightly frayed at the edges. It started with rows over the home secretary's thoughts on the character of the English and the failings of Hampstead liberals, moved on to the controversy over his decision to allow General Pinochet to return to Chile, before ending in a big battle over his plans for jury trials and the debacle over Tyson's entry to Britain. By his own estimation Jack Straw has just faced his most testing week as home secretary since the publication of the Lawrence inquiry report nearly a year ago. It was the sheer range of issues involved that was so difficult, and which left Radio 4's Today programme sounding like the Jack Straw show. \"Do things ever go well at the home office?,\" sighed a source close to Mr Straw when asked for his verdict on the week. Mr Straw had enjoyed a relatively quiet Christmas and new year break. As one senior home office civil servant put it: \"My heart missed a beat when I turned on the radio and heard there had been a prison breakout, but it turned out that it was in Paraguay.\" The only issue to really trouble Mr Straw over the long break was what to do about Kalejs, the alleged Nazi war criminal, who had been discovered to be living in Britain. That did not go too well with home office sources privately admitting that it would have been better if the police could have been persuaded to hold a press conference explaining exactly what the difficulties were in gathering the evidence against him before he left for Australia under the threat of deportation. Fancy footwork It is not without irony that Mr Straw said that \"with hindsight\" Kalejs's name should have been on the immigration service's 500,000 strong \"suspects' index\" which might have prevented him getting into the country in the first place - although as we now know that is a rule which is applied, at least in the case of heavyweight boxers, with some flexibility. It has been said that being home secretary is the kind of occupation in which you are walking down the street in glorious sunshine and without a cloud in the sky one moment, only to find yourself soaked through and dashing for the shelter of the nearest doorway by the time you reach the first corner. Most politicians find it impossible to cope with these sudden political storms, which is one reason why few home secretaries last more than a year or two in the job. The last Tory government went through four home secretaries in four years, including Ken Baker and David Waddington. But Jack Straw, like his predecessor, Michael Howard, seems to positively thrive on these political confrontations to such a degree that it would not be surprising to learn that he regularly hums Singin' in the Rain in the bath. But this week has underlined one crucial difference between Michael Howard and Jack Straw. Mr Howard, partly driven by ideological determination, would doggedly stick with whatever decision he had made regardless of all the available evidence. Mr Straw, however, has got the speed and fancy footwork needed to undertake the crucial U-turns whenever they are necessary to avert political disaster. His trick is to go around being brutally honest about it and not pretending that he hasn't changed his mind. So we saw a home secretary who, at the beginning of the week could not possibly intervene in the immigration service's decision not to allow Mike Tyson to enter Britain as a convicted rapist, take the \"courageous decision\" on Thursday to let him in because of the \"exceptional circumstances\" that some small traders in Manchester could face bankruptcy and that thousands of boxing fans who had bought tickets would be disappointed. It was, apparently, only when further legal advice arrived on Wednesday at the same time as a 67-page submission from the fight promoter, Frank Warren, that it became clear the home secretary could override the immigration service's view that Tyson would not be allowed in when he arrived. The decision over General Pinochet was in some ways easier for Mr Straw. All he did was follow the procedure set out in the extradition law to the letter. As even Michael Howard conceded this week, Straw was in a political \"lose, lose\" situation over the Pinochet decision as the threat of action by the high court judges was always a more potent factor in his mind than the politics of the Labour party. Those closest to him believe that most of his Labour critics at Westminster accept that the medical reports show that the decision that the former Chilean dictator was unfit to stand trial was the right one. Rumblings of anger But as a couple of Commons early day motions testify, the rumblings of anger continue and not just among the usual suspects of the Labour hard left. As Mr Straw pointed out to his \"liberal left\" critics on Thursday in his speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research: \"Labour home secretaries are always bound to be damned from both sides.\" But as the pace of the week's events got ever faster, some of the footwork started to look distinctly dodgy. An anodyne response to an official inquiry report saying that the Metropolitan police had failed to rise to the challenge of confronting racism in its ranks over the past year was quickly followed by some spurious arguments in defence of his restrictions on the right to jury trial. Those behind the looming House of Lords revolt rightly claimed that the upper house has every right to tear this particular bill to pieces on the firm grounds that it was not a manifesto commitment and Labour actually went into the last election firmly opposed to the very idea. It did nothing, however, to deter Jack Straw. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I accept that I have moved my position on this. The more I have examined the evidence the more it becomes overwhelming and the more the case against change simply dissolves.\" This, apparently, was also the case for the attorney-general, Lord Williams, who before the last election went on record saying the whole scheme was \"madness\". As for the difficulties about not mentioning it in the manifesto, well, Labour might not have said anything explicit but the party had promised to \"modernise the criminal justice system\" and that covered it as far as Mr Straw was concerned. This kind of double talk might just have enabled Mr Straw to keep up to speed with the events of this week but many of his cabinet colleagues were left floundering in his wake. The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, for example, appeared to have only a tenuous grasp of the details of the arguments when he appeared on a home office-dominated Question Time on BBC1. Mr Straw will be able to recuperate watching his beloved Blackburn Rovers this weekend before returning to face another gruelling week as home secretary. What's on the agenda?

      "body": "<p><strong> The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness </strong> by Antonio Damasio 385pp, Heinemann, \u00a320 <br> </p> <p> The nature of consciousness is a traditionally lofty subject, which has long seemed the province of philosophers rather than scientists or doctors. In this book, the eminent neurologist Antonio Damasio tries to show the general reader how consciousness can be explained by experimental science. He guides us through his life's work: to understand not only how the brain forms mental images, but how we have a sense of a self-knowing that we are doing so. </p> <p>Damasio's previous book, Descartes' Error , was named after the Western thinker who is often held responsible for the dualism of mind and body that Damasio challenges. The Feeling of What Happens elaborates upon his theory that \"the part of the mind we call the self\" is grounded on a \"collection of nonconscious neural patterns standing for a part of the organism we call the body proper\". </p> <p> Damasio finds the roots of the singularity of self in the simple observation that we each have one body. This is not a new idea. He finds precedents in Kant, Nietzsche, Freud and Merleau-Ponty, and sees some reassuring efforts in contemporary philosophy to establish a close relationship between cognition and the representation of the body. </p> <p>Scientists tend to be wary of investigating the self-consciousness that is the habitual concern of philosophers. Damasio cites Francis Crick's caution in his The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul that \"there are many forms of consciousness, such as those associated with seeing, thinking, emotion, pain and so on . . . Self-consciousness - that is, the self-referential aspect of consciousness - is probably a special case of consciousness. In our view, it is better left to one side for the moment\". In Damasio's opinion, the omission of self-reference may hamper efforts to understand consciousness as a whole. </p> <p>Behind this book lies an ongoing research project, which aims to devise testable hypotheses regarding the neuroanatomy of consciousness. Until recently, advances in the area of brain function were made by observing peo ple with sites of brain damage called lesions. Damage to circumscribed regions gives rise to particular deficits and behavioural change. A small blockage to an artery feeding part of the brain which organises the production of speech can lead to a person becoming incomprehensible, whilst still able to understand everything around them. It was often necessary to wait until autopsy to fit the symptoms of neurological illness to the cause. In this way, over the years, a large number of brain functions have been traced to specific areas of the brain. </p> <p>In the last 20 years, new techniques in imaging have enabled neurologists to examine 3D pictures of the living brain, while cognitive and/or behavioural tests are performed. The information is displayed on a computer screen. Brain activity levels can be assessed using PET (positron emission tomography) or fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Changes in electrical potentials can be measured from scalp, skin and brain surface and can indicate areas of abnormal brain activity. </p> <p>Damasio is utterly convincing in his contention that there will one day be an anatomy of conscious ness. However, there may not be one site or \"seat\" of consciousness. Damasio divides consciousness into \"core consciousness\" and \"extended consciousness\". Core consciousness is not exclusively human. Its scope is the \"here and now\". Extended consciousness is individual identity, providing a sense of past and future. Extended consciousness can be damaged, without affecting core consciousness, but damage to core consciousness spells disaster for consciousness as a whole. </p> <p>Damasio illustrates this theory with fascinating examples from his clinical work. He describes a man called David, who developed encephalitis at the age of 46, sustaining major damage to his left and right temporal lobes. From this time on, he was unable to learn any new facts. Each time he sees a member of his family, it is as if he is seeing them for the first time, although, once he establishes who they are, he has some knowledge of their names and relationship to him. David manages to keep up with the social conventions of a conversation, but lacks autobiographical memory to inform his social behaviour. His extended consciousness is impaired. Damasio draws two conclusions from this: that factual knowledge is not a prerequisite for core consciousness, and that those regions of David's brain that are damaged cannot be responsible for core consciousness. </p> <p> The link between emotion and consciousness is Damasio's central theme. For him, consciousness develops from emotions, and emotions inform our reasoning and decision-making. Evidence for this is drawn from the investigation of people, who were entirely rational until they sustained neurological damage either by stroke, tumour or head injury. Although logical thinking remained intact, they would make irrational decisions, which were disadvantageous to themselves and others. Damasio suggests that it is the emotional input to the nervous system that affects the mechanism of reasoning. He concludes that a reduction of emotion is as prejudicial to rationality as excessive emotion. Clearly emotions are no substitute for reason, yet reason is curiously handicapped without them. </p> <p>The story of a woman called S shows how a damaged emotional response can affect the very ability to survive. S suffers from a rare condition, Urbach-Wiethe disease, which is characterised by abnormal deposition of calcium in the skin, throat and brain. In the case of S, a part of her brain - the amygdala - was damaged bilaterally. S could learn new facts, had no problems with language or movements and had normal basic intelligence. However, it was as though she were devoid of negative emotions such as fear and anger. She was unable to attribute correctly the emotion of fear in the face of others, or to mimic an expression of fear. If all faces appear trustworthy and approachable, it is hard to appreciate social risks, and this leads to increased vulnerability to environmental dangers. </p> <p> The Feeling of What Happens comes to life when Damasio writes about neurology. The case histories are beautifully crisp and simple. While his explanations will be understood by a variety of readers with a scientific background, some of the more abstract discussions may be difficult, though not impossible, for the general reader to comprehend. While he acknowledges the work of contemporary philosophers of consciousness, it can be hard, without prior knowledge of this area, to see what their arguments are in relation to his own, and thus to assess how radical his own research has been. He relies on a basic knowledge of books like Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained (1994), Thomas Nagel's The View from Nowhere (1986) and John Searle's The Rediscovery of the Mind (1992). Whilst he describes consciousness studies as having been devised \"by a handful of philosophers and scientists, independently, unwittingly and unexpectedly\", in fact he makes this field seem rather clubbable. </p> <p>Yet, daunting though this theme might seem, there are rewards for those who are willing to meet the challenge of reading Damasio's book. There are few more interesting subjects in the world than the source and workings of consciousness and rarely has there been an author better qualified to explain them.</p>",

David manages to keep up with the social conventions of a conversation, but lacks autobiographical memory to inform his social behaviour. His extended consciousness is impaired. Damasio draws two conclusions from this: that factual knowledge is not a prerequisite for core consciousness, and that those regions of David's brain that are damaged cannot be responsible for core consciousness. The link between emotion and consciousness is Damasio's central theme. For him, consciousness develops from emotions, and emotions inform our reasoning and decision-making. Evidence for this is drawn from the investigation of people, who were entirely rational until they sustained neurological damage either by stroke, tumour or head injury. Although logical thinking remained intact, they would make irrational decisions, which were disadvantageous to themselves and others. Damasio suggests that it is the emotional input to the nervous system that affects the mechanism of reasoning. He concludes that a reduction of emotion is as prejudicial to rationality as excessive emotion. Clearly emotions are no substitute for reason, yet reason is curiously handicapped without them. The story of a woman called S shows how a damaged emotional response can affect the very ability to survive. S suffers from a rare condition, Urbach-Wiethe disease, which is characterised by abnormal deposition of calcium in the skin, throat and brain. In the case of S, a part of her brain - the amygdala - was damaged bilaterally. S could learn new facts, had no problems with language or movements and had normal basic intelligence. However, it was as though she were devoid of negative emotions such as fear and anger. She was unable to attribute correctly the emotion of fear in the face of others, or to mimic an expression of fear. If all faces appear trustworthy and approachable, it is hard to appreciate social risks, and this leads to increased vulnerability to environmental dangers. The Feeling of What Happens comes to life when Damasio writes about neurology. The case histories are beautifully crisp and simple. While his explanations will be understood by a variety of readers with a scientific background, some of the more abstract discussions may be difficult, though not impossible, for the general reader to comprehend. While he acknowledges the work of contemporary philosophers of consciousness, it can be hard, without prior knowledge of this area, to see what their arguments are in relation to his own, and thus to assess how radical his own research has been. He relies on a basic knowledge of books like Daniel Dennett's Consciousness Explained (1994), Thomas Nagel's The View from Nowhere (1986) and John Searle's The Rediscovery of the Mind (1992). Whilst he describes consciousness studies as having been devised \"by a handful of philosophers and scientists, independently, unwittingly and unexpectedly\", in fact he makes this field seem rather clubbable. Yet, daunting though this theme might seem, there are rewards for those who are willing to meet the challenge of reading Damasio's book. There are few more interesting subjects in the world than the source and workings of consciousness and rarely has there been an author better qualified to explain them.",

      "body": "<p>Mir, the Russian space station consigned to the flames after 13 extraordinary years in orbit, may be saved after all. An international consortium is quietly negotiating with Russian space chiefs to rescue the doomed ship. </p> <p>There has been nobody aboard Mir since its last crew left in August. Mission controllers said they would let the 140-ton spacecraft sink slowly towards the earth's atmosphere, and then push it into a last, fiery descent this year. </p> <p>This week a spokesman for Energia, the Russian rocket builders, said that they were planning to send a crew for a last mission before it was guided down into the Pacific Ocean. But he also confirmed another possibility - that an international group being formed in the US but almost certainly to be based in Europe could keep Mir alive. At least $7m (about \u00a34.4m) has been paid to the Russians, and a total of $20m could be on the way. </p> <p>There have been several much-publicised attempts to rescue Mir, all of which have swiftly fizzled out. This time, the deal - if it comes off - will be the result of months of negotiation by Rick Tumlinson of the Space Frontier Foundation, a US lobby group, and Jeffrey Manber, for years the manager of Energia's Washington office. </p> <p>\"It will be an international company, located in Europe, backed by people worldwide, and we are not buying Mir. Mir is the property of the Russian government. We are creating a partnership with Energia that will together market and raise funds and enter into corporate partnerships that are appropriate,\" said Mr Manber. \"That's about where we are now. We are expecting to sign with Energia and hold a press conference in a couple of weeks.\" </p> <p>One member of the as-yet-incomplete consortium is a venture capital firm called Golden Appel. Another partner does not wish to be named. Mr Manber keeps stressing that the rescue is not an American effort, that there are sound business reasons for keeping Mir going - and good philosophical reasons too. But the task may still be beyond them. </p> <p>Mir was designed to fly for about five years: in fact, it was occupied for 12 years. During that time, Russian cosmonauts were joined by European and American men and women astronauts, and together over the years they survived fire, an oxygen crisis, computer failure, a crash and even overflowing lavatories. </p> <p>But since the door was slammed on Mir for the last time, there have been new problems. Mir is losing 200 metres of altitude every day. It is also slowly leaking its burden of air. If too much goes, no future crew will be able to occupy it. There is also the huge fuel cost of kicking the spacecraft back into higher orbit, and keeping it there, when cosmonauts return. </p> <p>But the rescuers had an outline for that, too: seven miles of copper wire trailing behind the spacecraft, stealing power for free from the earth's magnetic field. They called it Mets, for Mir electrodynamic tether system. The idea has been tested a number of times in space. A wire drawn through a magnetic field generates electrical power: the longer the wire, the higher the voltage. It was a way of converting spacecraft momentum into kilowatts, which could be used to give the spacecraft more momentum. </p> <p>But, according to Mr Tumlinson, of the not-for-profit Space Frontier Foundation, which campaigns for private enterprise in space, the plan ran into problems with the US state department. </p> <p>\"There is a witch-hunt going on here about tech transfer, even though the air force people say this is not a threatening technology. I can't even have my engineers talk to the Russians about it,\" he said. \"I remember calling up one of my guys early on when we started the process and saying: 'I have just entered Alice Through the Looking Glass here, up is down, black is white, nothing makes sense.' We are doing exactly what the Clinton administration wanted to in space, we are keeping Russians employed, we are bringing part of their space programme out into the west and we are pumping money into their economy and we are going to give them a positive symbol of the free enterprise system.\" </p> <p>So for the time being, Mir drifts steadily down towards the abrasive atmosphere, as it orbits the planet at 17,500mph at an altitude of about 200 miles, going from dawn to dawn every 90 minutes with nobody aboard. </p> <p>The rescuers have problems with Russian bureaucracy, but also with US authorities. Mir was supposed to die, and the Russians were to put all their efforts into Nasa's latest baby, the $40bn international space station which is slowly taking shape. Now, suddenly, Mir might not die. </p> <p>\"Nasa hates this,\" says Mr Tumlinson. \"Imagine you are Nasa, you have spent all these years conning the world into believing that your $40bn space station is going to solve all these problems, and somebody opens up a little shop down the street. That's what's happening here.\" </p> <p><strong>How to put ship to use</strong></p> <p><strong> Growth industries</strong> Proteins, drugs and crystals might all form more perfectly in very low gravity. </p> <p><strong> Observation</strong> Mir could become a platform for sophisticated sensors watching the planet, or the wider solar system </p> <p><strong> Start-up capital</strong> Future space industries such as asteroid mining, or solar power factories, need somewhere to start from. Mir could be an outpost of the future. </p> <p><strong> Age of wonder</strong> To stay in microgravity is to experience bone loss, muscle atrophy and balance problems - the curses of old age. Medics see space as a laboratory. </p> <p><strong> Small hotel</strong> Space, for the super-rich, is the ultimate trip. </p> <p><strong> Shooting stars </strong> To look plausible, space movies need a free-fall location.</p>",

We are expecting to sign with Energia and hold a press conference in a couple of weeks.\" One member of the as-yet-incomplete consortium is a venture capital firm called Golden Appel. Another partner does not wish to be named. Mr Manber keeps stressing that the rescue is not an American effort, that there are sound business reasons for keeping Mir going - and good philosophical reasons too. But the task may still be beyond them. Mir was designed to fly for about five years: in fact, it was occupied for 12 years. During that time, Russian cosmonauts were joined by European and American men and women astronauts, and together over the years they survived fire, an oxygen crisis, computer failure, a crash and even overflowing lavatories. But since the door was slammed on Mir for the last time, there have been new problems. Mir is losing 200 metres of altitude every day. It is also slowly leaking its burden of air. If too much goes, no future crew will be able to occupy it. There is also the huge fuel cost of kicking the spacecraft back into higher orbit, and keeping it there, when cosmonauts return. But the rescuers had an outline for that, too: seven miles of copper wire trailing behind the spacecraft, stealing power for free from the earth's magnetic field. They called it Mets, for Mir electrodynamic tether system. The idea has been tested a number of times in space. A wire drawn through a magnetic field generates electrical power: the longer the wire, the higher the voltage. It was a way of converting spacecraft momentum into kilowatts, which could be used to give the spacecraft more momentum. But, according to Mr Tumlinson, of the not-for-profit Space Frontier Foundation, which campaigns for private enterprise in space, the plan ran into problems with the US state department. \"There is a witch-hunt going on here about tech transfer, even though the air force people say this is not a threatening technology. I can't even have my engineers talk to the Russians about it,\" he said. \"I remember calling up one of my guys early on when we started the process and saying: 'I have just entered Alice Through the Looking Glass here, up is down, black is white, nothing makes sense.' We are doing exactly what the Clinton administration wanted to in space, we are keeping Russians employed, we are bringing part of their space programme out into the west and we are pumping money into their economy and we are going to give them a positive symbol of the free enterprise system.\" So for the time being, Mir drifts steadily down towards the abrasive atmosphere, as it orbits the planet at 17,500mph at an altitude of about 200 miles, going from dawn to dawn every 90 minutes with nobody aboard. The rescuers have problems with Russian bureaucracy, but also with US authorities. Mir was supposed to die, and the Russians were to put all their efforts into Nasa's latest baby, the $40bn international space station which is slowly taking shape. Now, suddenly, Mir might not die. \"Nasa hates this,\" says Mr Tumlinson. \"Imagine you are Nasa, you have spent all these years conning the world into believing that your $40bn space station is going to solve all these problems, and somebody opens up a little shop down the street. That's what's happening here.\" How to put ship to use Growth industries Proteins, drugs and crystals might all form more perfectly in very low gravity. Observation Mir could become a platform for sophisticated sensors watching the planet, or the wider solar system Start-up capital Future space industries such as asteroid mining, or solar power factories, need somewhere to start from. Mir could be an outpost of the future. Age of wonder To stay in microgravity is to experience bone loss, muscle atrophy and balance problems - the curses of old age. Medics see space as a laboratory. Small hotel Space, for the super-rich, is the ultimate trip. Shooting stars To look plausible, space movies need a free-fall location.",

      "body": "<p>Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, yesterday tried to steal a march over its competitors with the offer of a million seats at prices that make a return rail fare from London to Birmingham look like daylight robbery. </p> <p>Travelling with only a suitcase and a small bag, Ryanair's energetic chief executive, Michael O'Leary, spent yesterday revealing his bag of riches. The most ridiculous example is what amounts to a net fare of \u00a34 from Stansted to Dublin, plus the compulsory \u00a320.68 airport taxes, making the fare a snip at \u00a324.99. </p> <p>The return fares are available from Monday either on Ryanair's web site or through travel agents until February 17, and will be valid for travel until April 12. They are offered on 21 of the company's low fare European routes, ranging from \u00a329.99 to Frankfurt and \u00a339.99 to Stockholm. </p> <p>The economics of the operation appear to defy explanation, although Mr O'Leary, dressed as though for summer in an open necked shirt, jeans and boots, says it is very simple. </p> <p>Unlike many other low cost carriers, Ryanair is profitable. Its accounts show that it made profits of more than \u00a340m last year and, according to Mr O'Leary, will make around \u00a350m this year. Not much perhaps, in terms of the airline business, but more profit, for instance, than British Airways will achieve this year. </p> <p>Mr O'Leary has no problems getting personal. \"BA have been going downhill for years. I don't think they have the right management. Bob Ayling has long stopped pulling his weight,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It is ridiculous you have to pay \u00a3200 on a BA flight to have a gin and tonic. It has been overcharging for years. Especially on its overseas flights.\" </p> <p>He is however kinder to another rival, Richard Branson. \"I think Virgin have good PR, but they are a tiny airline with only 2m passengers. Branson got a great deal by selling out [for \u00a3600m] to Singapore.\" </p> <p><strong> Sail trimming</strong><br> </p> <p> There is clear evidence in the industry to show that too many seats are chasing too few customers. Recent traffic growth has been brought about by selling seats well below cost. For the survival of operators, flights have to be trimmed to the numbers of seats required for passengers who are willing to pay sensible prices for their journeys. What marks Ryanair out over its competitors is how many people opt to fly the carrier. </p> <p>BA will make a substantial loss this year and has taken the lead by reducing seat capacity by 12% over the next three years. Among the other large European operators, KLM and SAS are both feeling the financial pinch and among the recent low cost operators, Debonair's insolvency surprised no one. </p> <p>The problem of unwanted capacity is not restricted to operators near home. Perhaps the most significant is the case of Canadian Airlines, which despite a creditable load factor of 76%, is insolvent. Why? For selling seats too cheaply. </p> <p>For the brash and breezy Mr O'Leary, is low fares is the only policy and it is work ing. Some 40% of Ryanair's customers are business travellers, who are not sniffy, and 55% of the company's 7m users originate within the UK. Before Ryanair took a grip, flying from London to Dublin was a big deal. The minimum return fare was \u00a3212 if you booked three months in advance. </p> <p>The profiles of Mr O'Leary describe him as an accountant, but he never finished his accountancy exams. He did join the accountants KPMG in the early 80s, but worked as a tax consultant before setting up on his own. His activities ranged from property development to buying and selling newspapers. He was a born entrepreneur and was about to rescue a small ailing Irish airline. </p> <p>One of his tax clients was Tony Ryan, who had started an airline to compete with Aer Lingus. It had a business class section and served meals, but it charged lower fares than Aer Lingus. The results were disastrous. In the late 1980s, Ryan's company lost copious amounts of money and went through five chief executives in four years. </p> <p>Mr Ryan asked Mr O'Leary what he should do. \"I said close it down. You couldn't give it away.\" </p> <p>But Mr Ryan had another idea. He knew Herb Kelleher, who ran Southwest Air lines in the United States. \"We went to look at Southwest. It was like the road to Damascus. This was the way to make Ryanair work,\" recalls Mr O'Leary. </p> <p>The Southwest formula was to serve no meals, offer no frills and charge the cheapest fares in town. Mr O'Leary tried it at Ryanair, launching low cost services between London and Dublin. He soon discovered that he did not have to lure passengers away from the established airlines. </p> <p>By charging low fares, he could expand the market, selling tickets to people who might not previously have considered flying. The number of passengers flying between Dublin and Stansted has more than quadrupled over the past decade, turning Dublin into one of the most sought after capitals in Europe for weekend breaks. </p> <p><strong> Summer holiday</strong><br> </p> <p> Ryanair has probably managed to cut its overheads even more than other low cost carriers. It serves only drinks, which saves staff clearing up biscuit and crisp crumbs between flights. Turn round is only 25 minutes which means, says Mr O'Leary, that the company's aircraft are 25% more productive than a large carrier or even other low cost airlines. </p> <p>The company is going into the summer season with six new European routes which it has yet to announce. It has ordered five new Boeing 737s, and is carrying more passengers than Aer Lingus and the Belgian carrier, Sabena. Mr O'Leary admits that potential passengers are kept hanging on the telephone for far too long, but argues that booking on the internet will soon remove this problem. </p> <p>Why has Ryanair been so successful? For one thing it refrains from intensive market research. Mr O'Leary produces a Reader's Digest map of Europe and says: \"We look for the signs which show there's an airport somewhere and go and talk with them.\" </p> <p>The company flies only to airports that agree to low landing charges. This usually means avoiding airports used by most other carriers. For Paris, for example, Ryanair flies to the relatively unknown Beauvais airport, rather than Charles de Gaulle or Orly. For Brussels, it flies in to Charleroi, 35 miles south of the city. </p> <p>At 38, Mr O'Leary is the youngest and one of the most engaging of airline tycoons. He is \"depressingly single and living in hope that a woman will find me suf ficiently attractive to settle down.\" </p> <p>Out of work, his main love seems to be his home, a 250-acre farm an hour's drive from Dublin, where he breeds cattle and horses. He is a very wealthy man, but says that his main concern is the well-being of his staff, due to rise from 1,300 to 1,500 later this year. </p> <p>Some of them may regard that as a tongue in cheek remark since he does not recognise trade unions and recently engaged in a bloody dispute with baggage handlers during which he effectively faced them down. But he stresses that he is not anti-union. His staff are all shareholders and have share options varying from \u00a34,000 to \u00a320,000 depending on length of service. </p> <p>He does not count himself as part of the Irish establishment, being currently involved in a tussle with Dublin airport to prevent an increase in its charges. He has also been accused of \"tooth and claw capitalism\" by the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, but laughs it off as a \"political speech made to a trade union audience, so what would you expect?\" </p> <p>There is no sign that the upward surge in Ryanair's fortunes will be dented, since unless some internal catastrophe is waiting, the airline's plans are for development rather than retrenchment. </p> <p>But Mr O'Leary is not convinced that many low cost carriers will be functioning five years from now. He thinks that Go, BA's low cost carrier will be struggling, and wonders whether Easyjet will eventually over-reach itself. He would say that of course. Mr O'Leary's forecast is that by the middle of the decade there will only be two cheap no-frills airlines left. Naturally, Ryanair will be one of them. </p> <p>Useful links: <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.ie\">www.ryanair.ie </a></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are politicians who think politics is a crusade. And there are those who see it as something altogether more subtle, a tale of deal-making and negotiation, cogs and wheels, a human account of personality and circumstance. Conservatives, until Mrs Thatcher mutinied, were traditionally pragmatists captured only occasionally by principle, sea-anchors on the pirate ship of progress. \"Programme?\" as Churchill once said, \"of course we have a programme. It is a sound belief in the British Constitution.\"</p> <p>For most of her reign, Mrs Thatcher's personal sea-anchor was a self-made businessman with a misleadingly modest demeanour. Often obscured by the larger and grander Willie Whitelaw, John (now Lord) Wakeham was her chief whip and later, in a succession of Trollopian-sounding sinecures, lord privy seal and lord president of the council - jobs which left him free to be what amounted to Mrs T's man of business. He squared the party at Westminster, or tricky cabinet ministers, or conflicting policy ambitions, and occasionally warned her that it couldn't be done. Wakeham became a kind of pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter version of Whitelaw.</p> <p>\"My ambition was to make the country run better. I am a facilitator, I make things work. I can take a programme of legislation, with everyone wanting something different, and I can end up delivering something everyone can live with.\"</p> <p>But he had been out of government for the best part of five years and, as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, lost to public view, when Tony Blair recruited him to sort out his growing political difficulties over the future of the Lords. He needed someone to chair the royal commission on reform, someone trusted by all sides who wouldn't push an agenda of their own, someone who would deliver a solution that would work.</p> <p>Reform of the Lords is the last hole in his jigsaw of constitutional reform: Wakeham's job is to make a piece that fits. Next Thursday the report is published and Wakeham will reveal - with no advance notice to Blair, he insists - whether he has pulled it off. \"The test of success,\" says Wakeham, \"will be that people will say, 'well, a bit disappointing, not quite what I wanted, but we can live with it' ... because if it was wonderful for somebody it would be unacceptable to someone else.\"</p> <p>What to some politicians would be a disastrous lack of conviction and fighting instinct, is to Wakeham the supreme virtue. Where others dream of redesigning the economic or social landscape, his dream is simply an engineer's desire to make things work. Trust is the lubricant of the Wakeham machine. \"I don't think there are too many people who can move into one set of politicians or another set of politicians and be trusted enough to do deals with them. People trust me. They know I'll play straight and try to find a solution.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair is not trusting Wakeham on his reputation alone. Less than two years ago, Blair's lord chancellor and his home secretary were at loggerheads over the impact of incorporating the European convention on human rights on press freedom. Lord Irvine argued it would have no effect. Jack Straw was a lot less confident and so was Wakeham. Then, as the legislation went through parliament, Irvine did a U-turn which enabled Jack Straw to change the bill in a way which the Press Complaints Commission is now confident will protect self-regulation. Wakeham is credited with being the key intermediary.</p> <p>He has prospered by cutting deals and troubleshooting for most of his adult life, a skill acquired, his more snobbish critics claim, from his garage-owning father, Walter. But John Wakeham might have been a farmer (he now owns a farm in south west Wales), and a perfect day for him is to get up with the dawn, get the papers from the shop in the Hampshire village where he lives, go down to the Solent and motor his old fishing boat to Osborne Bay where he anchors, reads the papers and makes calls on his mobile. \"I can talk to the people I need to. No one can reach me.\"</p> <p>This is the independence his father, a powerful presence in his son's mind even 30 years after his death, told him to strive for.</p> <p>\"There was only one sort of materialistic ambition my father gave me, and that wasn't to be rich, it was to be independent. He thought you should do things in life which gave you as much freedom to move as possible. That's why I became an accountant. I was never quite sure whether he was a Conservative, but he used to say, 'you've got to give the elected government of the day the benefit of the doubt, until they've been proved wrong'. He was methodical, level-headed, he didn't get too excited. I'm quite methodical, and I don't get too excited.\"</p> <p>Years later, lamenting the damage to political life caused by the antipathy between Margaret Thatcher and Neil Kinnock, a friend remembers John shaking his head sadly, as he said: \"The trouble is they're different ages, different ideologies, different life experiences. Their lives scarcely touch at any point.\" At heart, Wakeham probably believes the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, whoever they are, are united by more than divides them, and that like Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson they should, after a particularly bruising encounter at the despatch box, meet privately for a drink and a bit of mutual backslapping.</p> <p>John Wakeham was born in 1932, the first of three children. His father came back from the war to the family garage in what was then the small market town of Godalming in Surrey, just in time to scrape together the money to send John off to Charterhouse, the nearby public school. Major Wakeham had firm views about education. He believed that 10 years of it was quite enough. That ruled out university. But, through what he regards as his father's sacrifices in sending him to public school, the young John slipped quietly through the conventional life pattern of the professional middle classes, leaving scarcely a ripple: Charterhouse School, the City, Westminster and the Carlton Club.</p> <p>Eric Harrison, a master who taught him chemistry and became a friend, remembers him as \"very receptive, very pleasant to deal with\". Hardly the stuff of greatness. \"No, I wouldn't have predicted great things from him. But it's often the ones who don't stand out at school who go on and do well.\"</p> <p>Wakeham seems to have turned a tendency to anonymity into an asset. No need to airbrush him out of recent history as the Tories struggle to reinvent themselves. No one remembers he was there in the first place. His name is in the indexes of all those fat political memoirs of Mrs Thatcher's ministers but it's hard to find him in the narrative. \"Subtle\" and \"wily\" are the two adjectives most often attached to his name. Yet he was at the top table for many of the major events from the moment he became chief whip in 1983 until he failed to fix it for Thatcher in 1990, not as some Machiavellian string-puller, but as the team mechanic, the man with the oily rag who knew how to make things work.</p> <p>It's said that he endeared himself to Thatcher because he'd passed his accountancy exams - qualifications her son Mark had failed to notch up. It seems more plausible that it was his subsequent business success that marked him out in his prime minister's eyes. He turned his accountancy training into a highly profitable flair for company doctoring, which had made him his first million before he was out of his twenties. Less than 10 years later, as well as a thriving accountancy practice, he had a controlling interests in half a dozen companies. By the time he married his first wife Roberta (they had met at an English Speaking Union party in 1962) and prepared to go into politics, he had 1,000 people working for him.</p> <p>But Tory selection committees are notoriously sceptical of success. Or perhaps it was a lack of ideological zeal, showing through even then. (He is proud to boast that he is one of only three non-voting members of the Fabian society. The others are Sir Geoffrey Howe and John Maynard Keynes. \"I didn't support Labour, I joined because I was interested in politics.\") It took him nearly 10 years to find and win a safe seat: he was finally elected, for Maldon in Essex, in 1974, distinguished from the other new entrants, it's said, only by having his own driver and car phone.</p> <p>\"If you look at the 100 or so of that intake, there were obvious people like Leon Brittan and Nigel Lawson who were going to make it. But me? Not many would have forecast it.\" Not that he went into politics, he claims unconvincingly, to get on. \"I felt I owed it to my father to have wider ambitions than just being an accountant. I felt I had to justify myself.\"</p> <p>Political history is littered with the failed careers of people who, having been stars in their own world, sweep into politics to make a similar success only to lose their way in the arcane, contrary labyrinth of Westminster. Wakeham set out to learn. As soon as he had sorted out his business interests and made himself available for promotion, he was recruited into the whips' office. It didn't take him long to realise that his skills, honed in business, could be applied as usefully to the backstairs of Westminster politics.</p> <p>\"I was absolutely fascinated by how Westminster actually works, the interplay of all the different forces, the smoke-filled rooms, the nods and the winks. As a businessman, I found it more comprehensible than most politicians do. The driving force in my life is how you make things happen, what are the processes which make things move ahead. \"One thing I learnt as chief whip,\" he goes on, \"was the infinite capacity of human beings to absorb flattery. And that the one thing you have to be is trustworthy. If you sell someone a pup once, you'll never be trusted again.\"</p> <p>Trust is Wakeham's secret weapon. \"You could tell him anything, and I mean anything, and know it would never go any further,\" one old colleague reported. \"And people on all sides of the house knew that. And you know where you stand, you always know what basis you're talking to him on, that he's not operating some secret scheme of his own.\" One ex-whip, Andrew Mitchell, remembers being recruited by Wakeham. \"He was amazing. He said, 'I will tell you everything. Don't let me down'. Can you think of a better way of ensuring someone's loyalty? He's remarkably uncynical about people. If he thinks you're a good egg, he'll forgive you the crassest mistakes. If he doesn't, you're in outer darkness.\"</p> <p>For all of Thatcher's second term, Wakeham was her chief whip, her capo di tutti capi, running the team responsible for keeping the leadership in touch with the troops, soothing egos, balancing interests, trying to make sure everyone who mattered got a little of what they wanted. In particular, he was careful to keep the wets, the refuseniks, on board (and out of the then flourishing SDP). Julian Critchley, one of the government's most devastating backbench critics, says he was formidable. \"He was extremely well briefed,\" he says. \"Once, when Francis Pym, who'd been chief whip himself, told him just as a courtesy that he was going to make a speech at the Oxford Union condemning Thatcher and all her works, Wakeham said, 'oh, I know all about that'. And he had part of Pym's speech in front of him on his desk.\"</p> <p>Part of Wakeham's strength was that he was never \"One of Us\", but he and Thatcher remain close. \"I was not impervious to her weaknesses,\" he says. \"But I think she did a tremendous job at the things she had to do for this country. And I could help her. I got things delivered. I didn't go running to her with problems. She never wanted to trim. Sometimes you had to force her to. I used to give her my best advice, but if it was unpalatable I told it to her before a meeting, so that no one else knew and she could play the meeting how she liked; if she wanted to she could ask what I had thought. We achieved a lot of things that way.\"</p> <p>He also had a huge majority. He exploited it to turn the whips' office into a political nursery, a test bed for talent. He was Thatcher's scout, and he spotted John Major, who wrote of him: \"John Wakeham was subtle, reflective, a persuader, a fixer, fascinated by why something happened rather than simply what had happened... he played Mrs Thatcher like a master fisherman landing a prize salmon.\"</p> <p>In 1984, his life was shattered, and his career stalled, when the IRA killed his wife Roberta and very nearly killed him. After seven hours trapped in the wreckage of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, he was left with such terrible crush injuries to his legs that he nearly lost them. \"I can remember most of it... I was very clear that my responsibility was to bring up my sons, who were nine and 11. If I became bitter about it all there was no way I could make a happy home for them, and I had to force myself not to be bitter. You did your crying at night.\"</p> <p>There is an agonising pause as he is suddenly overwhelmed with memories. \"I've never dreamt about it, thank God. One of the most distressing things was when I talked to a girl who is writing a book about the fire brigade, and she played me an interview with the guy who was in charge that night.\" It is the magnitude of the fire chief's horror at his predicament which he finds devastating to hear. \"'There's another guy in there, Wake-somebody...'\" Wakeham breaks off abruptly. \"No, I can't do this, it's not fair.\"</p> <p>His life was put back together by his secretary, Alison Ward. They married in 1985 and, when they had a son together, she also adopted the two boys from his first marriage. They are now grown up: Jonathan is in advertising, but also writes (opera libretti and film scripts); Ben is an estate agent. Alison had worked for Thatcher and is by all accounts a powerful personality. \"It's said of her that on a bad day she can turn milk to yoghurt at 50 paces,\" her husband announces.</p> <p>A close colleague describes Wakeham as \"very, very private. Too private. I doubt that even his wife really knows him. He keeps his own feelings very quiet.\" The bomb is not a part of his life he can easily bring himself to revisit. He refuses to comment on the Northern Ireland peace process and the early release of the bombers. His tone suggests that if he did, it would not necessarily be in a spirit of forgiveness.</p> <p>But Matthew Parris, a friend, agrees that he has succeeded in escaping bitterness. \"Whereas Norman Tebbit grew angrier, it seems to me John Wakeham has grown more mellow.\"</p> <p>He was back in the whips' office, on two sticks but miraculously walking, more quickly than anyone believed possible. By the 1987 elec tion, after four years as chief whip, he wanted a real role to play, his own powerbase, and preferably his own department to run, although he told friends he knew he couldn't take a job which would be too physically demanding. When Nigel Lawson asked him to be his number two as Treasury Chief Secretary, he said no. \"He obviously hoped for something better\", Lawson recorded in his memoirs.</p> <p>But he had had a patchy 1987 election campaign, and Mrs Thatcher put him into another negotiating role, as Leader of the house. It was only after she needed his job for Sir Geoffrey Howe that he finally became secretary of state for energy. It was ideally suited for a businessman-fixer. The biggest and most complex of the privatisations, electricity, was running into the ground under Cecil Parkinson. Wakeham regards it as his finest hour. Stephen Littlechild, the economist who became the privatised industry's first regulator, agrees. \"Much of the conceptual thinking had been done,\" he recalls, \"but it was not clear that privatisation was actually going to go ahead. Wakeham did it, with charm, and without making enemies. He took each party separately, told them he understood their concerns but had to take account of others too. He won respect from all concerned. He put together a package which gave something to all the main players.\"</p> <p>Matthew Parris agrees. \"It is impossible to overrate him as a fixer. He is a master of never adding insult to injury. I don't see him as a political original, like Willie Whitelaw, but if I wanted somebody to break difficult news, or to persuade someone of something difficult to accept, I would go to John Wakeham.\"</p> <p>Just as the climax of electricity privatisation approached in 1990, the crisis of nerve among Tory MPs over Thatcher's leadership reached its own climax, and Sir Geoffrey Howe sank the assassin's dagger between her shoulderblades. When the disastrous results of the first ballot came through, Thatcher turned to Wakeham, to try to rescue her doomed campaign. But he had been too absorbed in the privatisation to be up to speed with the state of mind of the cabinet, never mind the wider party.</p> <p>Fatally, it was his idea that, since she could not stay without cabinet's support, she should ask her ministers for it, individually. Although only the most committed Thatcherites believe it was an act of disloyalty, it was a terminally serious misjudgment about how to play a desperate situation. As they trooped in one by one to tell her she couldn't win, she was left with no option but to resign.</p> <p>At first it seemed he would prosper under the new regime: as chief whip he had, after all, talent-spotted the new prime minister . Instead his influence waned sharply. In 1992 he went to the Lords. \"Cabinet ministers are like football managers. Everyone's endlessly discussing their prospects. When John Major asked me to be leader of the Lords, I said only for two years. That was my way of making sure my political career didn't end in tears.\"</p> <p>But observers thought he looked uncomfortable in the Lords, that the difficulty of dealing with the unpredictable and undisciplined hereditary peers didn't suit his more mechanistic approach to deal-making. \"Government Fixer Needs New Tool Kit\", one headline writer claimed. \"Past his sell-by date\" they wrote when he went.</p> <p>But Wakeham's reputation is built on the ability to see what's round the corner. Through the late 80s and into the 90s, as the details of the Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage came to the lascivious attentions of the tabloids, steam had been building behind demands for laws to control what the papers could print. Mrs Thatcher asked Wakeham to explore ways of making controls work. He reported (by then to John Major) that they couldn't. \"I've always been sympathetic to a free press. It's very high on everyone's list of characteristics of a free society. I persuaded John Major that it was better to try to let self-regulation assert itself and the press took it on, and set up the Press Complaints Commission.\"</p> <p>In 1995, \"by a whole range of coincidences\", Wakeham, newly out of government, became PCC chairman, and for the second time in his life, found the perfect playground for the intuitive negotiator, the man who likes to make things run smoothly. High on his list of priorities were the dire relations between the palace and the press. Wakeham carefully enumerated the areas for negotiation: a balance between the young princes' right to the same treatment as any other children and the press's legitimate interest in the way they were growing up; the palace's failure to find the right moments to present the princes to the press - and the danger of Prince Charles passing on his contempt for the media to his sons.</p> <p>The answer to these problems seems to have been Wakeham's protege Mark Bolland, former director of the PCC but now a senior figure in Prince Charles's entourage and widely credited with transforming the relationship between St James's Palace and Fleet Street.</p> <p>Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, says Wakeham is \"magnificent\". \"He is one of the most adroit and adept managers and fixers I have ever dealt with. One of his great qualities is that he always calms everything down, he stops people acting on the spur of the moment. He makes everyone think they've got the best deal. He's a brilliant manipulator, in the best sense of the word.\"</p> <p>If the royal story looks better though, there are plenty of critics of the PCC's clout in the more run-of-the-mill episodes of press manipulation. The number of complaints has doubled, and only a couple of months ago a tabloid was in the dock again over paying a witness in the Gary Glitter trial. \"It's a complete waste of time,\" said one ex-colleague of Wakeham, not one of his admirers. \"He's got absolutely no vision at all. He only ever asks how instead of why.\"</p> <p>On the other hand, demand for legislation has gone quiet and, Wakeham says darkly, the tabloids have far more intrusive stories they could print and don't. He believes they are behaving more responsibly. You can see that the whole idea of the law being used to resolve disputes is unattractive to him. You go with the flow, he believes, tightening the voluntary code as he did, for example, after Princess Diana's death, when resistance is weakest, and do all you can to avoid challenges on points where you won't carry popular support.</p> <p>But the Wakeham magic is not infallible. In 1996, he stepped into the poisonous brew of British horseracing. He became chairman of the recently-founded British Horseracing Board, set up to try to unite for the first time the diverse interests of bloodstock breeders, owners, trainers and racecourse owners. He was supposed to be using his influence in Whitehall to get some tax concessions. He failed: not only did he not win the concessions but he did not even get an agreed position to present to government.</p> <p>\"He hadn't taken on board how difficult it is to control a collection of sectional interests, some of whom are there only for their own ends,\" says one close student of his progress. \"The BHB's founding principle was that everyone was united in seeking the greater good of the industry. But when it came to the crunch, they all fought like cornered rats for their own interests.\"</p> <p>\"He didn't handle himself very well,\" one of the grander grandees muses. \"For the first time, probably, he found himself in a world without sanctions. He didn't have the authority to make people agree. So he walked out.\" In the view of the old Jockey Club types, he decided to protect his reputation rather than lay it down for the greater good of the sport of kings. Wakeham was bruised by the experience. He doesn't like to fail, even if he thinks it's everyone else who's in the wrong. It undermines his conviction that in the end, anything can be settled by a clever deal.</p> <p>It was one of those deals which got him into racing in the first place. He wanted to sail. His first wife Roberta wanted to go racing. \"So I used to put all those entrance badges you get each time you go racing into a little box on my desk, and every time we went sailing I'd take two out. As long as there were badges in the bowl, I felt it was OK to go sailing.\"</p> <p>Sailing, Wakeham's lifelong passion only recently given up because he feels he's no longer nimble enough, is itself the ultimate negotiation between man and the elements, where your very life can depend on an accurate assessment of external factors and their influence on your chosen course. Of course sailing is much easier if you don't much mind where you make your landfall.</p> <p>Wakeham, whose hero, oddly, is the uncompromising Admiral Nelson, now awaits judgment on what could be the most enduring of deals he has ever worked on, the future of the House of Lords. He has to navigate a course to a second chamber which doesn't challenge the role of the Commons (can't be all elected) or put unacceptable powers of patronage into prime ministerial hands (can't be all appointed) but which does, somehow, find a way of reflecting the constituent parts of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>\"The Lords has got to be complimentary to the Commons: the Commons has the democratic mandate but the Lords has to be the house of authority. And you can argue that part of that authority must come from the people. The politicians have got to have the final say because otherwise the report will just gather dust on the shelves the way royal commission reports do. And, if you're going to make constitutional advance it is infinitely better if you can get as broad a cross-section of support as possible.\"</p> <p>So, don't hold your breath for radical ideas. Like devolution, the new House of Lords is more likely to be a process than an event. But if it's a success, John Wakeham will have built a fine memorial for himself as the man who could make things work.</p> <p>Life at a glace</p> <p><b> John Wakeham, Baron of Maldon in the County of Essex</b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> June 22 1932. <br><b> Education: </b> Charterhouse School; chartered accountancy. <br><b> Married: </b> 1965 Anne Roberta Bailey (died 1984), two sons; 1985 Alison Bridget Ward, one son. <br><b> Political career:</b> <br>MP (Con) Maldon, 1974-1983, Colchester South and Maldon 1983-92; <br>Asst govt whip 1979-81 <br>Parliamentary undersecretary, dept of industry, 1981-2<br> Minister of state, treasury, 1982-3<br> Chief whip, 1983-87<br> Lord Privy Seal, 1987-8<br> Leader of the House of Commons 1987-9 <br>Lord President of the Council, 1988-89 <br>Sec of state for energy, 1989-92 <br>Minister responsible for coordinating the presentation of government policies, 1990-92; <br>Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, 1992-4.</p> <p><b> Other appointments:</b> <br>Chairman, British Horseracing Board, 1996-98<br> Chancellor, Brunel University 1998-.</p> <p><b> Honours:</b> Life peer,1992.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are politicians who think politics is a crusade. And there are those who see it as something altogether more subtle, a tale of deal-making and negotiation, cogs and wheels, a human account of personality and circumstance. Conservatives, until Mrs Thatcher mutinied, were traditionally pragmatists captured only occasionally by principle, sea-anchors on the pirate ship of progress. \"Programme?\" as Churchill once said, \"of course we have a programme. It is a sound belief in the British Constitution.\" For most of her reign, Mrs Thatcher's personal sea-anchor was a self-made businessman with a misleadingly modest demeanour. Often obscured by the larger and grander Willie Whitelaw, John (now Lord) Wakeham was her chief whip and later, in a succession of Trollopian-sounding sinecures, lord privy seal and lord president of the council - jobs which left him free to be what amounted to Mrs T's man of business. He squared the party at Westminster, or tricky cabinet ministers, or conflicting policy ambitions, and occasionally warned her that it couldn't be done. Wakeham became a kind of pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter version of Whitelaw. \"My ambition was to make the country run better. I am a facilitator, I make things work. I can take a programme of legislation, with everyone wanting something different, and I can end up delivering something everyone can live with.\" But he had been out of government for the best part of five years and, as chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, lost to public view, when Tony Blair recruited him to sort out his growing political difficulties over the future of the Lords. He needed someone to chair the royal commission on reform, someone trusted by all sides who wouldn't push an agenda of their own, someone who would deliver a solution that would work. Reform of the Lords is the last hole in his jigsaw of constitutional reform: Wakeham's job is to make a piece that fits. Next Thursday the report is published and Wakeham will reveal - with no advance notice to Blair, he insists - whether he has pulled it off. \"The test of success,\" says Wakeham, \"will be that people will say, 'well, a bit disappointing, not quite what I wanted, but we can live with it' ... because if it was wonderful for somebody it would be unacceptable to someone else.\" What to some politicians would be a disastrous lack of conviction and fighting instinct, is to Wakeham the supreme virtue. Where others dream of redesigning the economic or social landscape, his dream is simply an engineer's desire to make things work. Trust is the lubricant of the Wakeham machine. \"I don't think there are too many people who can move into one set of politicians or another set of politicians and be trusted enough to do deals with them. People trust me. They know I'll play straight and try to find a solution.\" Tony Blair is not trusting Wakeham on his reputation alone. Less than two years ago, Blair's lord chancellor and his home secretary were at loggerheads over the impact of incorporating the European convention on human rights on press freedom. Lord Irvine argued it would have no effect. Jack Straw was a lot less confident and so was Wakeham. Then, as the legislation went through parliament, Irvine did a U-turn which enabled Jack Straw to change the bill in a way which the Press Complaints Commission is now confident will protect self-regulation. Wakeham is credited with being the key intermediary. He has prospered by cutting deals and troubleshooting for most of his adult life, a skill acquired, his more snobbish critics claim, from his garage-owning father, Walter. But John Wakeham might have been a farmer (he now owns a farm in south west Wales), and a perfect day for him is to get up with the dawn, get the papers from the shop in the Hampshire village where he lives, go down to the Solent and motor his old fishing boat to Osborne Bay where he anchors, reads the papers and makes calls on his mobile. \"I can talk to the people I need to. No one can reach me.\" This is the independence his father, a powerful presence in his son's mind even 30 years after his death, told him to strive for. \"There was only one sort of materialistic ambition my father gave me, and that wasn't to be rich, it was to be independent. He thought you should do things in life which gave you as much freedom to move as possible. That's why I became an accountant. I was never quite sure whether he was a Conservative, but he used to say, 'you've got to give the elected government of the day the benefit of the doubt, until they've been proved wrong'.

Their lives scarcely touch at any point.\" At heart, Wakeham probably believes the prime minister and the leader of the opposition, whoever they are, are united by more than divides them, and that like Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson they should, after a particularly bruising encounter at the despatch box, meet privately for a drink and a bit of mutual backslapping. John Wakeham was born in 1932, the first of three children. His father came back from the war to the family garage in what was then the small market town of Godalming in Surrey, just in time to scrape together the money to send John off to Charterhouse, the nearby public school.

But, through what he regards as his father's sacrifices in sending him to public school, the young John slipped quietly through the conventional life pattern of the professional middle classes, leaving scarcely a ripple: Charterhouse School, the City, Westminster and the Carlton Club.

Hardly the stuff of greatness. \"No, I wouldn't have predicted great things from him. But it's often the ones who don't stand out at school who go on and do well.\" Wakeham seems to have turned a tendency to anonymity into an asset. No need to airbrush him out of recent history as the Tories struggle to reinvent themselves. No one remembers he was there in the first place. His name is in the indexes of all those fat political memoirs of Mrs Thatcher's ministers but it's hard to find him in the narrative. \"Subtle\" and \"wily\" are the two adjectives most often attached to his name.

And that the one thing you have to be is trustworthy. If you sell someone a pup once, you'll never be trusted again.\" Trust is Wakeham's secret weapon. \"You could tell him anything, and I mean anything, and know it would never go any further,\" one old colleague reported. \"And people on all sides of the house knew that. And you know where you stand, you always know what basis you're talking to him on, that he's not operating some secret scheme of his own.\" One ex-whip, Andrew Mitchell, remembers being recruited by Wakeham. \"He was amazing. He said, 'I will tell you everything. Don't let me down'. Can you think of a better way of ensuring someone's loyalty? He's remarkably uncynical about people. If he thinks you're a good egg, he'll forgive you the crassest mistakes. If he doesn't, you're in outer darkness.\" For all of Thatcher's second term, Wakeham was her chief whip, her capo di tutti capi, running the team responsible for keeping the leadership in touch with the troops, soothing egos, balancing interests, trying to make sure everyone who mattered got a little of what they wanted. In particular, he was careful to keep the wets, the refuseniks, on board (and out of the then flourishing SDP). Julian Critchley, one of the government's most devastating backbench critics, says he was formidable. \"He was extremely well briefed,\" he says. \"Once, when Francis Pym, who'd been chief whip himself, told him just as a courtesy that he was going to make a speech at the Oxford Union condemning Thatcher and all her works, Wakeham said, 'oh, I know all about that'. And he had part of Pym's speech in front of him on his desk.\" Part of Wakeham's strength was that he was never \"One of Us\", but he and Thatcher remain close. \"I was not impervious to her weaknesses,\" he says. \"But I think she did a tremendous job at the things she had to do for this country. And I could help her. I got things delivered. I didn't go running to her with problems. She never wanted to trim. Sometimes you had to force her to. I used to give her my best advice, but if it was unpalatable I told it to her before a meeting, so that no one else knew and she could play the meeting how she liked; if she wanted to she could ask what I had thought. We achieved a lot of things that way.\" He also had a huge majority. He exploited it to turn the whips' office into a political nursery, a test bed for talent. He was Thatcher's scout, and he spotted John Major, who wrote of him: \"John Wakeham was subtle, reflective, a persuader, a fixer, fascinated by why something happened rather than simply what had happened... he played Mrs Thatcher like a master fisherman landing a prize salmon.\" In 1984, his life was shattered, and his career stalled, when the IRA killed his wife Roberta and very nearly killed him. After seven hours trapped in the wreckage of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, he was left with such terrible crush injuries to his legs that he nearly lost them. \"I can remember most of it... I was very clear that my responsibility was to bring up my sons, who were nine and 11. If I became bitter about it all there was no way I could make a happy home for them, and I had to force myself not to be bitter. You did your crying at night.\" There is an agonising pause as he is suddenly overwhelmed with memories. \"I've never dreamt about it, thank God. One of the most distressing things was when I talked to a girl who is writing a book about the fire brigade, and she played me an interview with the guy who was in charge that night.\" It is the magnitude of the fire chief's horror at his predicament which he finds devastating to hear. \"'There's another guy in there, Wake-somebody...'\" Wakeham breaks off abruptly. \"No, I can't do this, it's not fair.\" His life was put back together by his secretary, Alison Ward. They married in 1985 and, when they had a son together, she also adopted the two boys from his first marriage. They are now grown up: Jonathan is in advertising, but also writes (opera libretti and film scripts); Ben is an estate agent. Alison had worked for Thatcher and is by all accounts a powerful personality. \"It's said of her that on a bad day she can turn milk to yoghurt at 50 paces,\" her husband announces. A close colleague describes Wakeham as \"very, very private. Too private. I doubt that even his wife really knows him. He keeps his own feelings very quiet.\" The bomb is not a part of his life he can easily bring himself to revisit. He refuses to comment on the Northern Ireland peace process and the early release of the bombers. His tone suggests that if he did, it would not necessarily be in a spirit of forgiveness. But Matthew Parris, a friend, agrees that he has succeeded in escaping bitterness. \"Whereas Norman Tebbit grew angrier, it seems to me John Wakeham has grown more mellow.\" He was back in the whips' office, on two sticks but miraculously walking, more quickly than anyone believed possible. By the 1987 elec tion, after four years as chief whip, he wanted a real role to play, his own powerbase, and preferably his own department to run, although he told friends he knew he couldn't take a job which would be too physically demanding. When Nigel Lawson asked him to be his number two as Treasury Chief Secretary, he said no. \"He obviously hoped for something better\", Lawson recorded in his memoirs. But he had had a patchy 1987 election campaign, and Mrs Thatcher put him into another negotiating role, as Leader of the house. It was only after she needed his job for Sir Geoffrey Howe that he finally became secretary of state for energy. It was ideally suited for a businessman-fixer. The biggest and most complex of the privatisations, electricity, was running into the ground under Cecil Parkinson. Wakeham regards it as his finest hour. Stephen Littlechild, the economist who became the privatised industry's first regulator, agrees. \"Much of the conceptual thinking had been done,\" he recalls, \"but it was not clear that privatisation was actually going to go ahead. Wakeham did it, with charm, and without making enemies. He took each party separately, told them he understood their concerns but had to take account of others too. He won respect from all concerned. He put together a package which gave something to all the main players.\" Matthew Parris agrees. \"It is impossible to overrate him as a fixer. He is a master of never adding insult to injury. I don't see him as a political original, like Willie Whitelaw, but if I wanted somebody to break difficult news, or to persuade someone of something difficult to accept, I would go to John Wakeham.\" Just as the climax of electricity privatisation approached in 1990, the crisis of nerve among Tory MPs over Thatcher's leadership reached its own climax, and Sir Geoffrey Howe sank the assassin's dagger between her shoulderblades. When the disastrous results of the first ballot came through, Thatcher turned to Wakeham, to try to rescue her doomed campaign. But he had been too absorbed in the privatisation to be up to speed with the state of mind of the cabinet, never mind the wider party. Fatally, it was his idea that, since she could not stay without cabinet's support, she should ask her ministers for it, individually. Although only the most committed Thatcherites believe it was an act of disloyalty, it was a terminally serious misjudgment about how to play a desperate situation. As they trooped in one by one to tell her she couldn't win, she was left with no option but to resign. At first it seemed he would prosper under the new regime: as chief whip he had, after all, talent-spotted the new prime minister . Instead his influence waned sharply. In 1992 he went to the Lords. \"Cabinet ministers are like football managers. Everyone's endlessly discussing their prospects. When John Major asked me to be leader of the Lords, I said only for two years. That was my way of making sure my political career didn't end in tears.\" But observers thought he looked uncomfortable in the Lords, that the difficulty of dealing with the unpredictable and undisciplined hereditary peers didn't suit his more mechanistic approach to deal-making. \"Government Fixer Needs New Tool Kit\", one headline writer claimed. \"Past his sell-by date\" they wrote when he went. But Wakeham's reputation is built on the ability to see what's round the corner. Through the late 80s and into the 90s, as the details of the Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage came to the lascivious attentions of the tabloids, steam had been building behind demands for laws to control what the papers could print. Mrs Thatcher asked Wakeham to explore ways of making controls work. He reported (by then to John Major) that they couldn't. \"I've always been sympathetic to a free press. It's very high on everyone's list of characteristics of a free society. I persuaded John Major that it was better to try to let self-regulation assert itself and the press took it on, and set up the Press Complaints Commission.\" In 1995, \"by a whole range of coincidences\", Wakeham, newly out of government, became PCC chairman, and for the second time in his life, found the perfect playground for the intuitive negotiator, the man who likes to make things run smoothly. High on his list of priorities were the dire relations between the palace and the press. Wakeham carefully enumerated the areas for negotiation: a balance between the young princes' right to the same treatment as any other children and the press's legitimate interest in the way they were growing up; the palace's failure to find the right moments to present the princes to the press - and the danger of Prince Charles passing on his contempt for the media to his sons. The answer to these problems seems to have been Wakeham's protege Mark Bolland, former director of the PCC but now a senior figure in Prince Charles's entourage and widely credited with transforming the relationship between St James's Palace and Fleet Street. Piers Morgan, editor of the Mirror, says Wakeham is \"magnificent\". \"He is one of the most adroit and adept managers and fixers I have ever dealt with. One of his great qualities is that he always calms everything down, he stops people acting on the spur of the moment. He makes everyone think they've got the best deal. He's a brilliant manipulator, in the best sense of the word.\" If the royal story looks better though, there are plenty of critics of the PCC's clout in the more run-of-the-mill episodes of press manipulation. The number of complaints has doubled, and only a couple of months ago a tabloid was in the dock again over paying a witness in the Gary Glitter trial. \"It's a complete waste of time,\" said one ex-colleague of Wakeham, not one of his admirers. \"He's got absolutely no vision at all. He only ever asks how instead of why.\" On the other hand, demand for legislation has gone quiet and, Wakeham says darkly, the tabloids have far more intrusive stories they could print and don't. He believes they are behaving more responsibly. You can see that the whole idea of the law being used to resolve disputes is unattractive to him. You go with the flow, he believes, tightening the voluntary code as he did, for example, after Princess Diana's death, when resistance is weakest, and do all you can to avoid challenges on points where you won't carry popular support. But the Wakeham magic is not infallible. In 1996, he stepped into the poisonous brew of British horseracing. He became chairman of the recently-founded British Horseracing Board, set up to try to unite for the first time the diverse interests of bloodstock breeders, owners, trainers and racecourse owners. He was supposed to be using his influence in Whitehall to get some tax concessions. He failed: not only did he not win the concessions but he did not even get an agreed position to present to government. \"He hadn't taken on board how difficult it is to control a collection of sectional interests, some of whom are there only for their own ends,\" says one close student of his progress. \"The BHB's founding principle was that everyone was united in seeking the greater good of the industry. But when it came to the crunch, they all fought like cornered rats for their own interests.\" \"He didn't handle himself very well,\" one of the grander grandees muses. \"For the first time, probably, he found himself in a world without sanctions. He didn't have the authority to make people agree. So he walked out.\" In the view of the old Jockey Club types, he decided to protect his reputation rather than lay it down for the greater good of the sport of kings. Wakeham was bruised by the experience. He doesn't like to fail, even if he thinks it's everyone else who's in the wrong. It undermines his conviction that in the end, anything can be settled by a clever deal. It was one of those deals which got him into racing in the first place. He wanted to sail. His first wife Roberta wanted to go racing. \"So I used to put all those entrance badges you get each time you go racing into a little box on my desk, and every time we went sailing I'd take two out. As long as there were badges in the bowl, I felt it was OK to go sailing.\" Sailing, Wakeham's lifelong passion only recently given up because he feels he's no longer nimble enough, is itself the ultimate negotiation between man and the elements, where your very life can depend on an accurate assessment of external factors and their influence on your chosen course. Of course sailing is much easier if you don't much mind where you make your landfall. Wakeham, whose hero, oddly, is the uncompromising Admiral Nelson, now awaits judgment on what could be the most enduring of deals he has ever worked on, the future of the House of Lords. He has to navigate a course to a second chamber which doesn't challenge the role of the Commons (can't be all elected) or put unacceptable powers of patronage into prime ministerial hands (can't be all appointed) but which does, somehow, find a way of reflecting the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. \"The Lords has got to be complimentary to the Commons: the Commons has the democratic mandate but the Lords has to be the house of authority. And you can argue that part of that authority must come from the people. The politicians have got to have the final say because otherwise the report will just gather dust on the shelves the way royal commission reports do. And, if you're going to make constitutional advance it is infinitely better if you can get as broad a cross-section of support as possible.\" So, don't hold your breath for radical ideas. Like devolution, the new House of Lords is more likely to be a process than an event. But if it's a success, John Wakeham will have built a fine memorial for himself as the man who could make things work.

The dropping of some players has clearly benefited them in the long run - Darren Gough in 1996, for instance - but it is the treatment of young players that is most perturbing. If a young player is to be selected for Test cricket, he should surely be given five Tests minimum, barring a bad trot of Rutherfordian proportions.

(And this isn't just a current selectorial problem - Mark Ramprakash was nonsensically omitted from the three Tests in New Zealand in 1991-92, with Dermot Reeve playing his only three Tests instead; as a result, Ramprakash had, up to August 1998, played just one Test against teams other than West Indies, Australia, South Africa and Pakistan.)</p> <p> It seems that England's selectors only discover these newcomers' technical flaws in the Test arena (Chris Read standing up, for example, or Chris Adams outside off stump).

      "bodyText": "Which country will sign up for the euro first, Britain or East Timor? It may be a long shot but the odds are actually swinging towards East Timor. As the country seeks to rebuild its economy after the havoc caused by pro-Jakarta militias that followed East Timor's vote to end two decades of Indonesian rule, the main political grouping - the National Council for East Timorese Resistance - favours adopting the Portuguese escudo. The Indonesian rupiah is still the most widely used currency - ahead of the Australian and US dollars - but is regarded as too unstable to be a viable long-term option. Portugal is the former colonial power and is already offering substantial economic support. International Monetary Fund economist Luis Mendonca argued yesterday that the escudo is a part of the euro and the single currency would make a better option. \"I think the East Timorese themselves consider three currencies for the future - the US dollar, the Australian and the euro.\" The East Timorese will decide which currency to pick at the end of the year. When Britain will make its single currency decision is rather less clear. Yesterday the former European Union commissioner Sir Leon Brittan warned that indecision was damaging Britain's influence in Europe. \"There is no doubt at all there is uncertainty and division, with cabinet ministers taking up contrasting positions in public,\" he said. That was obscuring the government's position which meant \"we lose influence in Europe and any hope of playing a central and indeed a leading role in Europe becomes more and more remote\", Sir Leon said in a Radio 4 interview.",

      "bodyText": "The government's policy on school selection in England and Wales suffered an embarrassing setback yesterday, after the high court ruled that its admissions watchdog had acted unlawfully by ordering a cut in the number of pupils that three London secondary schools could select on the basis of academic ability. The Tory-controlled London borough of Wandsworth, the local authority that challenged the adjudicator's decision last year, declared the ruling \"a victory for the democratic decision-making of local government\". But new rules that came into force last September mean that, in effect, Wandsworth only gets a year's reprieve in which to continue its existing selection policy. Other local education authorities threatened with a similar ruling, such as Barnet in north London, are now considering whether to mount similar legal challenges. In a landmark ruling yesterday, Mr Justice Sullivan said the government's admissions adjudicator, Peter Downes, was wrong to try to stop the three schools \"creaming off\" the brightest pupils. He said the reductions - which were due to come into effect next September - would have resulted in \"a substantial change in the schools' function\" and that the adjudicator had acted outside his powers. Malcolm Grimston, chairman of Wandsworth council's education committee, welcomed the judge's decision, but warned that the amendment in government regulations made last September had given the adjudicator increased powers to restrict partial selection in future years. \"London has been failing its children for years and years because of this leftwing idea that children have to be treated as identical units,\" he said. \"This is a victory for the democratic decision-making of local government which clearly throws into doubt the authority of an unelected adjudicator.\" Of the Wandsworth schools, Graveney and Ernest Bevin, which currently admit 50% of their pupils on academic ability, were told by the adjudicator to reduce that figure to 25%. The third school, Burntwood, faced having to cut back the proportion from 32% to 25%. The adjudicator ordered the cuts last summer after governors of Honeywell infants and junior schools in south-west London, whose pupils are candidates for places, objected to the admissions policy proposed for the three secondary schools for the next academic year. Mr Justice Sullivan said in his ruling that the adjudicator had lacked power under the relevant admissions regulations to either abolish partial selection or reduce the number of pupils chosen by ability if it resulted in \"a substantial change in the schools' function\". The judge said: \"All the indications are to the effect that it would result in such a change, and I am therefore satisfied that all three determinations [for each of the schools] must be quashed.\" He stressed that his decision did not concern the merits of partial selection but was simply concerned with the procedures laid down for altering admission arrangements. Chief adjudicator Sir Peter Newsam said yesterday that the issue decided by the judge no longer applied, as regulations delegating necessary powers to his office had come into force in September. Normally, the objection raised by parents and other local schools could not be considered by his office again for a year, he said, in effect preserving admission arrangements at the schools in question until at least September 2002. The shadow education secretary, Theresa May, said: \"This case was all about Labour's plan to end selection by stealth. We oppose the appointment of unelected adjudicators, who make decisions that fly in the face of local people. Now government policy has been revealed for the sham that it is.\"",

      "body": "<p>ATuesday evening in October. The leadership of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party is on its way to Eton College. The mood in the car is pensive. Nobody says anything. Tonight, Alan Howling Laud Hope - Screaming Lord Sutch's old friend and successor - will address the Shelley Society, Eton's answer to the Oxford Union. He hopes to get his picture taken with Prince William. </p> <p>These are important times for Alan, a chance to prove to the outside world that the Loonies can survive the death of their founder and figurehead. When Screaming Lord Sutch committed suicide in June last year, many of the tributes and the obituaries presumed that his party was gone, too. But the Loonies are determined to survive, with Alan as their new leader. Sutch had his trademark leopard-skin coat. Alan has an elaborate all-white three-piece suit, with a big gold chain, some vast rosettes and an enormous prairie hat. He looks like Boss Hog from the TV show The Dukes Of Hazzard. </p> <p>Alan has brought along two fellow Loonies to Eton. There's Peter Stockton - his softly-spoken electoral agent and \"Minister for Rock and Roll\", and Barry Timmins, the \"Monster Raving Loony Backbench Snorer\". I am undercover, posing as the Loony's chauffeur, which is essentially true, for I am driving them there. They give me a loony chauffeur top-hat. I put it on. I don't consider myself that much of a loony. How will I cope in the event of hijinks? </p> <p>We pull up outside the college library and are soon greeted by two or three Eton boys, the organisers of tonight's lecture. \"Hello!\" they grin. </p> <p>\"Good evening,\" says Peter Stockton, looking at his watch. \"We're exactly on time, but you're actually a few minutes late.\" </p> <p>The boys continue grinning, in expectation of the punchline. But there isn't one. I suddenly feel a weight of responsibility on my shoulders. Not only do I need to maintain my chauffeur cover-story, but I also feel the urge to compensate for the Loonies' palpable absence of lunacy. </p> <p>\"'Ello,\" I say, in a slightly silly voice. \"I'm the chauffeur.\" An awkward silence. We glance at our feet. There is a little time to kill before the lecture begins, so we head for a bite to eat. </p> <p>\"What is the Loony view on Europe?\" the Eton boys ask Alan, in the way that a straight-man feeds a joke to his comedy partner. </p> <p>\"You'll hear my views later,\" he replies. \"But if you don't mind, I don't want to talk them all out now.\" </p> <p>\"Okay,\" say the boys. </p> <p>\"History is going to be made tonight!\" announces Barry, suddenly. \"History, mate!\" </p> <p>It is 8pm, and the Shelley Society is full. Previous guest speakers, such as the Hunt Saboteurs and Tariq Ali, spoke to an audience of around 60. But tonight is a sell-out, the Society's biggest audience ever. There are 200 boys inside and 100 have been turned away at the door. I assume the Eton boys invited the Loonies to speak for much the same reasons that Kermit the Frog was once booked to address the Oxford Union. High jinks are patently envisaged. We walk through the old oak doors of the library and into the venerable wood-panelled interior of the debating hall. The Eton boys, dressed in white bow ties and tails, rise to their feet as one and applaud us thunderously. Alan looks bowled over. It is a spectacular greeting. The scene is an ageless one. We could be looking at a costume drama - gracious children of the ruling class respectfully greeting one into their ranks. </p> <p>Barry, Peter and I take our seats at the front. We glance around for Prince William. We cannot spot him, but, then again, almost every boy in the room looks a little like Prince William. The average age is about 15. Peter is dressed in rock-'n'-roll black leather, with a fur-lined top hat and a lapel covered in guitar- shaped badges. Barry is in leopard-skin. </p> <p>Alan climbs on to the platform and he hushes the boys with his hands. The applause finally subsides. Alan coughs. \"Let me tell you how it all began,\" he says.\"I don't know if any of you ever saw Screaming Lord Sutch play live on stage? Any of you ever been to any of Sutchy's gigs?\" </p> <p>All 200 boys shake their heads. </p> <p>\"You're probably all too young,\" says Alan. \"But he was one of the best rock and rollers of all time. Everyone copied him. He didn't follow anyone. They were queuing up to work with him. Jeff Beck, everyone. I first met Sutchy back in 57. We were introduced to each other by Bob Potter. Do any of you watch the World Darts on TV?\" The Eton boys shake their heads. They look bewildered. </p> <p>\"Well,\" says Alan, \"Bob now owns the place where the World Darts contest is held. He's done all right for himself. Made a bob or two. Anyway . . .\" For the next half-hour, Alan tells of how he and Screaming Lord Sutch came to form the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. </p> <p>\"We first stood in Stratford-upon-Avon,\" he says, \"under the banner of the Teenage Party. The seat became free when Lord Profumo - anyone remember him? - had to resign because he . . . well . . . slept with a prostitute. Sutchy always said that prostitution got him into politics. Any of you related to Lord Profumo? Ha ha!\" </p> <p>I notice one or two of the masters blushing a little and glancing at the floor. What Alan doesn't realise, and we only learn later, is that John Profumo's grandson is actually sitting in the audience. </p> <p>\"We were campaigning for the abolition of the 11-plus,\" continues Alan, \"votes for 18s, all-day pub opening, and the implementation of commercial radio. The BBC had a stranglehold on the radio waves, see, and they didn't play rock and roll. This was back in 1964. Imagine that. A politician at the time - it might have been Alec Douglas-Home - said that our policies were just the rantings of raving loonies.\" </p> <p>Alan scans the room. \"As the years went by, commercial radio, votes for 18s, they all came into being. If those were raving- loony policies, we thought, let's become the Raving Loony Party. We added the word Monster because we genuinely thought we were going to be monster. Huge. If the people who didn't vote for anyone voted for us, we'd win! That's what we thought.\" </p> <p>\"ALL RIGHT!\" yells Barry from the seat next to mine. He is a little worse for wear from his day in the pub. \"TELL IT AS IT IS!\" </p> <p>There are coughs of surprise from the audience. By now, the Eton boys seem to have succumbed to the idea that they aren't in for an evening of lunacy. But Alan's story is unexpectedly fascinating, and he has our attention. \"Take those butter mountains,\" he says. \"What were they doing there? It seemed such a waste. So we said, 'Lets turn them into butter ski-slopes.'\" </p> <p>The children laugh and clap.\"And those beef mountains,\" says Alan. \"We said, 'Let's transport them down to the Sandwich Islands and then we can all have beef sandwiches!'\" </p> <p>The Eton boys cheer. Alan quietens them. </p> <p>\"You know what?\" he says. \"The Government got scared. They started handing back the butter and the milk and the cheese. They got the Sally Army to give them to the pensioners. Just because we made fun of it. See? Just because we highlighted it.\" </p> <p>There is a silence. Alan continues. </p> <p>\"Fifteen years ago we said, 'Let's have passports for pets. Dogs and cats. Don't put them in quarantine. Give them passports'. They laughed at us. Not that crazy, really.\" </p> <p>\"That's right!\" yells Barry, like an inebriated Greek chorus. \"That's RIGHT!\" </p> <p>Then it is time for the question-and- answer session. Those boys who had hoped for something more comedic from the evening take the opportunity to ask questions that might elicit a humorous response. </p> <p>\"Do you think people with beards should be allowed to stand for government?\" asks a boy from the back. There is some laughter. Alan looks baffled. </p> <p>\"Why shouldn't they?\" he replies. \"What's the problem with people with beards? I don't understand. Any other questions? Young boy, third row.\" </p> <p>\"Is your white suit a homage to Martin Bell?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know who Martin Bell is,\" says Alan. \"I'll tell you why I wear this white suit. I wear it as a tribute to Winston Churchill. He's my hero. That's who I copy. He is the only man in my lifetime who died to save us all. That's a fact.\" </p> <p>\"Good point!\" yells Barry. </p> <p>\"Next question?\" says Alan. </p> <p>\"What would you do if you became headmaster of this school?\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" says Alan, \"when I was at school, I got the cane, and I got the ruler. Let me tell you. It didn't do me any harm. What would I do if I was headmaster? I'd do it properly. Next question?\" </p> <p>\"Can I ask the man at the front . . .\" the questioner points at Barry, \". . . why he's a member of the Party?\" </p> <p>Barry blushes. \"Well,\" he says, rising to his feet. \"Alan helps you. See? He helps you rather than doesn't care about you. Could you have a pint with Tony Blair? No!\" </p> <p>Barry sits down. From his chair he hollers, \"We've been misled! We've been misled!\" </p> <p>\"Any more questions?\" asks Alan. </p> <p>\"I hear you're standing against Michael Portillo in the forthcoming Kensington and Chelsea by-election,\" says a boy. \"What are your policies for London?\" </p> <p>\"We're going to clean up the River Thames,\" says Alan. \"Fill it with alligators. You may laugh, but when you see alligator swamps on nature programmes, aren't they clean? So we'll fill the Thames with alligators, and get rid of them when there's no more pollution. Whether it works or not, it'll certainly make the Boat Race more interesting!\" There is a huge laugh and thunderous applause. And the debate is wrapped up. </p> <p> We leave for the journey back to London. Outside the debating hall, however, Alan is surrounded by Eton boys clutching autograph books. Richard Pratt, the social science master, stands to one side, watching this strange event unfold. </p> <p>\"We never get this,\" he says. \"This is even more adulation than Stephen Fry got. And Richard E Grant.\" </p> <p>Alan, encircled by a sea of boys in white bow ties and tails, beams. \"Excuse me,\" says one child, making his way through the crowd. \"I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated your kind words about my great, great grandfather, Winston Churchill.\" </p> <p>Alan appears startled. </p> <p>\"Bloody hell,\" he exclaims. \"Thank you.\" </p> <p>Peter Stockton, the Minister for Rock And Roll, approaches Richard. \"I hear you have a wonderful music room,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" says Richard. \"The facilities are quite extraordinary.\" </p> <p>\"I manage a band,\" says Peter, producing a business card from his pocket. \"They're called The Ravers. Pure rock and roll. How do we go about getting a gig here?\" </p> <p>Richard murmurs something about how Peter should approach the music master. Then he says to the children, \"Okay. Enough. This is a library, not a common room. On your way now.\" The boys dutifully file out. </p> <p>\"See?\" says Barry, putting a cigarette in his mouth. \"That's power you've got. That's real power.\" </p> <p>\"I'm sorry,\" says Richard, anxiously. \"This is a library. You can't smoke.\" </p> <p>\"Ha ha ha!\" says Barry, slapping Richard on the back. \"Fooled you! I do it just so people tell me I can't smoke and then I say, 'I'm not smoking! Look!'\" Barry points to the unlit cigarette. \"Look! I'm not smoking!\" </p> <p>Later on, as I drive the party leadership back on to the M4 towards west London, the mood is reflective. \"There's only one word for the Eton kids,\" says Barry. \"Delightful. They're delightful.\" </p> <p>\"It certainly is a breath of fresh air,\" says Peter. \"Where I come from,\" says Barry, \"the kids just slouch around housing estates telling you to piss off.\" </p> <p>\"It's another world,\" I sigh. \"Another world.\" </p> <p>\"It was a brilliant speech,\" says Barry. \"You spoke to the kids in a language they understand. Kids like that.\" </p> <p>\"When you get a reception like that, how can you fail?\" says Alan. </p> <p>\"Apparently, Prince William was in the audience, at the back,\" says Peter. \"At the end he was ushered out of another door.\" </p> <p>\"I can't believe Winston Churchill's great, great grandson came over to say hello,\" says Alan. \"That was thoughtful. Wasn't it thoughtful?\" </p> <p>The car goes quiet. We contemplate the events of the evening. I look in my rear-view mirror and I can see that Alan is smiling softly to himself. </p> <p>\"Don't vote Portillo! He may end up on your pillow! Don't vote Portillo! He may end up on your pillow!\" </p> <p>It is three weeks later, and the streets of Kensington are ringing to the sound of Monster Raving Loony by-electioneering. Alan and Peter are in a yellow mini-van, topped with a megaphone. Tonight, Alan is standing against Michael Portillo. This will be the Loonies' 60th election, and Alan's first since becoming leader. It is an important night. It will be seen as a barometer of the party's standing in the wake of Sutch's death. </p> <p>We park the car and head off to the Town Hall to collect our passes for the count. Unfortunately, we become lost on the way. We wander the evening streets of Kensington like headless chickens. </p> <p>\"Lost again,\" sighs Peter, ruefully. \"Well, that's Loony for you.\" </p> <p>The gates of a big house open as we walk past it, and a middle-aged black man wanders out. Peter asks him for directions. </p> <p>\"Left and left again,\" he replies. </p> <p>\"Thank you,\" we say. </p> <p>\"Huh!\" tuts Alan.\"Asking a black the way to the Town Hall!\" He mutters to himself in a what's-this-country-coming-to? kind of way. </p> <p>\"Will you stop being racist,\" says Peter, softly. </p> <p>At the Town Hall, a young Middle Eastern family are sitting in the reception, their suitcases piled up before them. \"I bet I know what's going on here,\" says Alan, loud enough for them to hear. \"Looking for a house. Mmm? Looking for a house on the social?\" </p> <p>Peter shoots Alan a look. I glance over at the family, who have obviously heard what Alan said. They seem uncomfortable and remain quiet - as if afraid that an unpleasant situation may arise if they say anything. </p> <p>It is a little shocking to see the chief Loony, in full Loony regalia, behaving in a fashion that one might expect from other loony political factions, but not from his. Coming from a political leader - even a Loony leader - this sort of thing is startling. </p> <p>Some time earlier, Alan had asked me about other stories I'd written, and I mentioned a documentary I made about the Ku-Klux Klan. </p> <p>\"I saw it,\" he said. \"I remember the scene where a bunch of niggers were shouting at some white bloke in a car park.\" </p> <p>There was a silence. </p> <p>\"I'm sorry?\" I said. </p> <p>\"All these niggers were shouting at some bloke,\" said Alan, merrily. Peter Stockton covertly shot Alan a stern glance. But Alan remained oblivious to the aftermath of his casual and unexpected racism. </p> <p> <strong> 'S </strong> o what's all this about you and black people?\" I ask him now. \"It's a joke,\" he says, immediately. \"I'm not racially prejudiced. None of us are. I'm not out to upset anyone. I wouldn't want to run anybody down. We've had some good times together, haven't we?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, we have,\" I say. </p> <p>\"It's just the same as when people make remarks about people who are gay. A joke comes up now and again.\" Alan pauses, anxiously. \"I know that a lot of ethnic people vote for us,\" he says. </p> <p>When I first met the Loonies, on the day of the Eton debate, Alan said a strange thing to me. He said, \"I hope you're sympathetic to our cause.\" I furrowed my brow. I didn't think they had a cause. I thought they just dressed up. But I nodded vaguely. I very much doubted, after all, that I would be unsympathetic. </p> <p>The longer I spend with them, however, the more I understand what Alan stands for. The Loonies portray themselves, essentially, as situationist anarchists. But they are more than that. Their disenfranchisement stems from what they see as the liberal erosion of Olde England. The 1999 Raving Loony newsletter, the Raving Chronicle, has bikini-clad pin-ups, and a parody of a Chinese take-away menu. The restaurant is called the Slitinese, and the joke dishes include \"Kow Pu\", \"Ars Pik\", \"Ho Mo\" and \"Yu Kum Steaming-Hot Custard\". </p> <p>\"What are your views on Britain entering Europe?\" I ask him. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you,\" he replies. \"You'll laugh, but just you wait. Ten or 15 years from now, it'll be government policy. We'll declare Great Britain the off-shore tax haven for all of Europe. We can tell those gnomes of Zurich to sling their fish-hooks. Then Europe will be ruled by London, rather than London ruled by Europe. And we'll have won. See?\" Alan grins. \"We'll have won!\" </p> <p>Back at the pub that the Loonies have made their base - the Churchill - we hook up with other Loonies for some last-minute electioneering. About half-a-dozen have turned up from across the country to offer their support. \"Excuse me!\" they yell at passers-by. \"Have you voted yet?\" \"Oh!\" replies one. \"I thought you were Morris Dancers. I'm glad you're not.\" </p> <p>\"How come you never see a Jewish Morris dancer?\" asks a Loony. \"You'd have to be a complete prick to be a Morris Dancer!\" </p> <p>\"Where's Screaming Lord Sutch?\" asks another passer-by. </p> <p>\"He's dead.\" replies a Loony. </p> <p>\"Oh.\" A pause. \"Sorry.\" </p> <p>\"Excuse me, Miss? Have you voted yet?\" </p> <p>The woman walks on in silence. </p> <p>\"I bet no one's gone down on you for months, love!\" they shout after her. </p> <p>Then a conversation ensues about whether Peter Stockton should, actually, refer to himself as the \"Minister for Rock and Roll\". </p> <p>\"Sutchy told Nick that he was the Minister for Rock and Roll.\" </p> <p>\"No,\" corrects Peter. \"Nick is the Midlands Minister for Rock and Roll.\" </p> <p>This conversation takes place with only a little humour. \"Sutchy gave me that title.\" </p> <p>There is a silence. </p> <p>\"Oh,\" says Peter, with soft finality. \"You can call me the Minister for Boogie Woogie.\" </p> <p>\"How about the Minister Without Portillo?\" suggests someone. </p> <p>\"That's gorgeous!\" </p> <p>\"How about the Minster Without Portaloo?\" </p> <p>\"That's a gem. We should use that one.\" </p> <p>The ghost of Screaming Lord Sutch is forever there. When the Loonies sing an impromptu song in a local pub, Alan yells, \"Three cheers for Screaming Lord Sutch!\" And in the reception of Alan's hotel in Devon (he is a hotelier by trade), there is a bright orange urn that reads, \"Ashes of Screaming Lord Sutch\". Inside are the contents of an old ashtray that was found in Sutch's home after his death. \"He committed suicide on my birthday,\" says Alan. \"Hung himself with a skipping rope. June 16th. Five months ago. I'll never forget that day.\" </p> <p>\"I had no idea he'd do it,\" says Barry. \"I guess his mother's death affected him in a big way. But we don't want him down as a mummy's boy. He had his high days and his low days like we all do. Hopefully you get through the low days. He was never morose in front of me. He was never down. But deep down where he lives . . . you just don't know what goes on down there.\" Barry pauses. \"Fuck me. It's easy to cancel yourself out. Easy to think you're not worth anything.\" </p> <p>\"How did you all hear of his death?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"The Daily Telegraph phoned me,\" says Alan. \"I said, 'It's a bit late to be phoning Monster Raving Loony headquarters, isn't it?' He said, 'You haven't heard the news.'\" Alan pauses. \"I knew straight away. I knew it would happen one day. Still, I said, 'You're not really from the Daily Telegraph.' He said, 'Unfortunately, I am . . .'\" There is a silence. </p> <p>\"I felt bloody annoyed,\" says Alan. \"If he'd been run over by a bus I'd have shed a tear. But there was so much going on for him. He'd just done that breakfast cereal advert, so he had money coming in.\" </p> <p>\"I'll tell you,\" says Peter, \"he'd have wanted that Coco Pops money to go to party funds. But we haven't seen a penny of it.\" </p> <p>\"What sort of man was he?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"He didn't drink and he didn't smoke,\" says Peter. \"He never swore. In all the years I knew him he only swore once.\" Peter pauses, then adds, \"But it wasn't in mixed company.\" </p> <p>\"Where was it?\" </p> <p>\"It was at the Winchester by-election. They didn't like the Loonies standing in Winchester. He just got frustrated. He said, 'bloody'.\" There is a silence. </p> <p>\"But I'm being too open,\" says Peter. </p> <p>In the wake of Sutch's death, a leadership contest was fought at Alan's hotel, the Golden Lion, and Alan was elected party leader, along with his cat, Mandu. </p> <p>A few days after the Eton debate, there was a Monster Raving Loony-related question on the Channel 4 quiz show, Fifteen To One. \"Which political party has a cat as its joint leader?\" </p> <p>\"The bloke didn't know the answer,\" says Alan. \"He said, 'Is it Labour?'\" Alan laughs. \"But you know what that question means, don't you? It means we're there. We're there.\" </p> <p>Now, the party is looking to Alan for direction. Since the earliest days, Alan was always the more sober policy man behind the eccentric figurehead of the Screaming Lord -which is why he's been so keen to promote what he considers the party's genuine contribution to the nation's political landscape. He is also the only Loony candidate to hold political office. He is the current mayor of Ashburton, Devon. \"I never wear the white outfit while I'm undertaking my mayoral duties,\" he says. \"When I'm mayor, I'm Clark Kent. When I wear the white suit, I'm Superman.\" Later that evening, back at the Churchill, some local journalists have assembled to write funny, light-hearted columns about the by-election. Alan reminisces about our time at Eton. </p> <p>\"Weren't those kids great?\" says Alan. \"Just great.\" </p> <p>\"You went to Eton?\" ask the journalists. </p> <p>\"Alan did a lecture on politics,\" explains Peter. \"And Prince William was there.\" </p> <p>\"Really?\" </p> <p>\"You should have seen the reception Alan got,\" says Peter. He looks to me for confirmation. </p> <p>\"Biggest turn out they ever had,\" I nod. \"It was euphoric.\" </p> <p>\"Alan now has very real credibility with the future leaders of Britain,\" says Peter. \"Some serious bridges were built that night.\" </p> <p>Closing time comes - and so we head to Holland Park School for the count. \"What result will you be happy with tonight?\" I ask Alan, on the way out. \"Two-fifty,\" he replies. \"That's my benchmark. I put a bet on myself with William Hill, and if I get 250 or more I'll get the \u00a3500 deposit back.\" </p> <p>\"We'll come fourth,\" says Peter. \"Just you watch.\" </p> <p>\"Fourth or fifth,\" says Alan. </p> <p>\"Definitely fourth,\" says Peter, confidently. \"Who's going to beat us?\" </p> <p>\"I'd like to see the faces of the Pro-Europe Conservative Party when we beat them,\" says Alan. \"We did once. I wonder how they felt to have been beaten by the Monster Raving Loony Party!\" </p> <p>\"Are you excited?\" I ask Alan. </p> <p>\"Oh God, yes,\" he grins, with a boyish enthusiasm. \"I'm so excited underneath it all.\" </p> <p>Although only six Loonies will be admitted to the count, a group of around 40 merry-makers has somehow formed, all of whom expect Peter to get them in to the election hall, past the heavy police security. Some of the new hangers-on - who are not Loonies and have appeared from nowhere - are drunk and aggressive. They decide that Gavan, Weekend Guardian's photographer, is a \"wank-face Tory twat police lackey cunt\" for telling them it is rude to smash beer bottles against the wall. Peter has a complex job on his hands. He must somehow separate the genuine Loonies from the drunken thugs, while averting an all-out fight, which is beginning to brew. </p> <p>\"All the Loonies must cross the road,\" whispers Peter to me, \"and then cross back again. Pass it on to the other Loonies.\" </p> <p>To make matters worse, he is finding it difficult to control some of his own members. We are yards from the school and Peter, a stickler for decorum and protocol, wants Alan to lead the group through the gates. </p> <p>\"Don't jump the gun, darling . . .\" He addresses a Loony woman, the Minister for Pets And Poo-Poo. \"You're charging in like a fucking rhinoceros. Alan is the leader. He must go in first.\" </p> <p>\"Sorry,\" she says. </p> <p>\"We'll put it down to a lack of experience, darling,\" snaps Peter through gritted teeth. </p> <p> Then Alan disappears. He has apparently decided to pop off for a quick sleep in the back of a party member's car. We set about trying to find him, while attempting to distance ourselves from the increasingly angry pub brawlers. In the midst of the mayhem, Peter looks frustrated and upset. I can see how passionately he feels about the party, about observing the proper etiquette. Peter is different from the others. He is upper-middle class, for a start, and has been a successful entrepreneur. He once managed Stringfellows and he co-owned two central London clubs, Lennons and Johnny O'Boogies, with Cynthia Lennon. I wonder how Peter feels about Alan's inopportune racism, which can only be a hindrance to the respectability of the Loonies - something that Peter quite obviously cares deeply about. </p> <p>\"Alan isn't a racist,\" he says. \"Not really. The only thing he eats is curry. And that's Indian food. Maybe he thinks it's funny, this colonial guy in the white suit and a white hat, saying colonial things.\" Peter pauses. \"Don't forget,\" he says, \"we're only the Monster Raving Loony Party. You don't have to be too hard on us. We're not something to be annihilated with AK47s.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, the Loonies, under Alan, are striving for political respectability - Peter himself says they should change their name to the Common Sense Party - and, like all politicians, they should be careful when a Guardian journalist, holding a notepad, is standing next to them writing down everything they say. </p> <p>Alan reappears, awake and ready for action, and we recruit some nearby policemen to help siphon the real Loonies off from the drunks. And then we enter the school. </p> <p>\"Are you planning to say anything to Michael Portillo?\" I ask Alan. </p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" he says. \"I'm going to say 'Hello Mr Port-a-loo. I mean, Hello Mr Port-a-cabin.' Then I'm going to hand him this.\" </p> <p>Alan shows me a brown envelope in which he's carrying a Monster Raving Loony Million Pound Note. This is Alan's stunt against political sleaze. If Portillo takes the gift, the Loonies will issue a press release saying that he has accepted a \u00a31-million Loony bribe in a brown paper envelope. </p> <p>We drink coffee, smoke cigarettes. A few journalists approach Alan. \"I suppose you'll have got some sympathy votes, what with Sutch dying and all,\" suggests one. </p> <p>\"Got any jokes?\" asks the man from the London Evening Standard. </p> <p>\"Jokes or anecdotes?\" asks Alan. </p> <p>\"Anecdotes will do,\" he says, \"as long as they're funny.\" </p> <p>Alan begins a story about how he mislaid his deposit on the way to the Town Hall. We are interrupted by a commotion from down the corridor. Michael Portillo has arrived. The camera crews stampede, and Alan is lost in the hubbub, clutching his Monster Raving Loony Million Pound Note. </p> <p>\"Mr Portillo!\" he yells. But everyone else is yelling \"Mr Portillo\", too, and Alan cannot get within a mile of him. </p> <p>Luckily, however, we have passes for the counting floor, and the other journalists don't. So we follow Portillo inside. Alan nervously approaches him. </p> <p>\"Mr Portillo?\" he says, his hand shaking a little. </p> <p>\"Hello,\" says Michael Portillo, extending his own hand. </p> <p>\"I have a gift for you,\" says Alan. </p> <p>Michael Portillo looks down at the brown envelope. He twigs. \"Not tonight thank you,\" he says. He turns his back. </p> <p>\"Hah!\" says Alan to whoever will listen. \"Michael Portillo has refused a \u00a31 million note!\" But the joke isn't quite as good now. </p> <p>Three hours later, the results. It is now the early hours of the morning. There are 18 candidates - ranging from Rainbow George's Lovebucket Party to the pro- Cannabis Party. Dressed all in white, with his huge hat, Alan is by far the most distinctive of all the candidates. He stands out - a flash of white among the dark colours. </p> <p>\"Alan Hope, Official Monster Raving Loony Party . . . 20.\" </p> <p>Alan punches the air. A small cheer goes up from his supporters, hesitantly, for it is a dreadful result. </p> <p>\"Michael Portillo . . . 11,004.\" </p> <p>When all the results have been announced, we realise the sad news that the Loonies have come an appalling 17th out of 18 candidates. Only the Stop Tobacco Companies From Harming Our Children Party fares worse, with 15 votes. </p> <p>In the long, strange history of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party - 30 years in opposition and 60 constituency elections - this is their worst result ever. </p> <p>Michael Portillo descends from the stage to be congratulated by his entourage, who are dressed from head to toe in blue. The blueness of Portillo's entourage makes them look like they're in costume, too. He shakes their hands briskly and he gives his wife a peck on the cheek. Then he hurries out of the door to a waiting car and is whisked away. </p> <p>\"Twenty votes,\" I say. </p> <p>\"Jesus Christ, that's dreadful,\" agrees Peter. </p> <p>It is 2.30am. The Loonies are the last to leave, along with a few policemen. </p> <p>\"I'm going to demand a recount!\" yells Alan to no one. \"Come back everyone!\" </p> <p>\"How do you feel?\" I ask him. </p> <p>\"Wonderful!\" he says. </p> <p>A few Loonies gather sadly around him in commiseration. We all know how much the party means to him. This is not lunacy for Alan. This is real. He attempts to buoy the Loonies up. \"It's a party record,\" he says. \"Our lowest vote ever! Any record is good.\" The only thing Alan admits being upset about is that he wasn't allowed to make a speech. </p> <p>\"I paid my \u00a3500, too, just like Portillo did,\" he says. \"Why was he allowed a speech and not me? I'm considering making a complaint.\" </p> <p>\"What would you have said?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"I would have said, 'Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and a very special thanks to our spiritual leader, Screaming Lord Sutch.'\" Alan raises his eyes skyward. This is the gesture he would have made. </p> <p>We wander outside into the dark, silent streets of Kensington. </p> <p>\"Twenty votes,\" I murmur. </p> <p>\"A new Loony record,\" says Alan. \"Lowest ever! Don't worry. We'll turn it to our advantage. Uh. We're still looking for that nil points that are very elusive! We're nearly there, but then 20 silly people voted for us! Uh. This is the Loony Party going back to basics . . . Nil points! Ha ha!\" </p> <p>At that, Alan disappears, smiling, into the land of comedy inspiration</p>",

      "bodyText": "ATuesday evening in October. The leadership of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party is on its way to Eton College. The mood in the car is pensive. Nobody says anything. Tonight, Alan Howling Laud Hope - Screaming Lord Sutch's old friend and successor - will address the Shelley Society, Eton's answer to the Oxford Union. He hopes to get his picture taken with Prince William. These are important times for Alan, a chance to prove to the outside world that the Loonies can survive the death of their founder and figurehead. When Screaming Lord Sutch committed suicide in June last year, many of the tributes and the obituaries presumed that his party was gone, too. But the Loonies are determined to survive, with Alan as their new leader. Sutch had his trademark leopard-skin coat. Alan has an elaborate all-white three-piece suit, with a big gold chain, some vast rosettes and an enormous prairie hat. He looks like Boss Hog from the TV show The Dukes Of Hazzard. Alan has brought along two fellow Loonies to Eton. There's Peter Stockton - his softly-spoken electoral agent and \"Minister for Rock and Roll\", and Barry Timmins, the \"Monster Raving Loony Backbench Snorer\". I am undercover, posing as the Loony's chauffeur, which is essentially true, for I am driving them there. They give me a loony chauffeur top-hat. I put it on. I don't consider myself that much of a loony. How will I cope in the event of hijinks? We pull up outside the college library and are soon greeted by two or three Eton boys, the organisers of tonight's lecture. \"Hello!\" they grin. \"Good evening,\" says Peter Stockton, looking at his watch. \"We're exactly on time, but you're actually a few minutes late.\" The boys continue grinning, in expectation of the punchline. But there isn't one. I suddenly feel a weight of responsibility on my shoulders. Not only do I need to maintain my chauffeur cover-story, but I also feel the urge to compensate for the Loonies' palpable absence of lunacy. \"'Ello,\" I say, in a slightly silly voice. \"I'm the chauffeur.\" An awkward silence. We glance at our feet. There is a little time to kill before the lecture begins, so we head for a bite to eat. \"What is the Loony view on Europe?\" the Eton boys ask Alan, in the way that a straight-man feeds a joke to his comedy partner. \"You'll hear my views later,\" he replies. \"But if you don't mind, I don't want to talk them all out now.\" \"Okay,\" say the boys. \"History is going to be made tonight!\" announces Barry, suddenly. \"History, mate!\" It is 8pm, and the Shelley Society is full. Previous guest speakers, such as the Hunt Saboteurs and Tariq Ali, spoke to an audience of around 60. But tonight is a sell-out, the Society's biggest audience ever. There are 200 boys inside and 100 have been turned away at the door. I assume the Eton boys invited the Loonies to speak for much the same reasons that Kermit the Frog was once booked to address the Oxford Union. High jinks are patently envisaged. We walk through the old oak doors of the library and into the venerable wood-panelled interior of the debating hall. The Eton boys, dressed in white bow ties and tails, rise to their feet as one and applaud us thunderously. Alan looks bowled over. It is a spectacular greeting. The scene is an ageless one. We could be looking at a costume drama - gracious children of the ruling class respectfully greeting one into their ranks. Barry, Peter and I take our seats at the front. We glance around for Prince William. We cannot spot him, but, then again, almost every boy in the room looks a little like Prince William. The average age is about 15. Peter is dressed in rock-'n'-roll black leather, with a fur-lined top hat and a lapel covered in guitar- shaped badges. Barry is in leopard-skin. Alan climbs on to the platform and he hushes the boys with his hands. The applause finally subsides. Alan coughs. \"Let me tell you how it all began,\" he says.\"I don't know if any of you ever saw Screaming Lord Sutch play live on stage? Any of you ever been to any of Sutchy's gigs?\" All 200 boys shake their heads. \"You're probably all too young,\" says Alan. \"But he was one of the best rock and rollers of all time. Everyone copied him. He didn't follow anyone. They were queuing up to work with him. Jeff Beck, everyone. I first met Sutchy back in 57. We were introduced to each other by Bob Potter. Do any of you watch the World Darts on TV?\" The Eton boys shake their heads. They look bewildered. \"Well,\" says Alan, \"Bob now owns the place where the World Darts contest is held. He's done all right for himself. Made a bob or two. Anyway . . .\" For the next half-hour, Alan tells of how he and Screaming Lord Sutch came to form the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. \"We first stood in Stratford-upon-Avon,\" he says, \"under the banner of the Teenage Party. The seat became free when Lord Profumo - anyone remember him? - had to resign because he . . . well . . . slept with a prostitute. Sutchy always said that prostitution got him into politics. Any of you related to Lord Profumo? Ha ha!\" I notice one or two of the masters blushing a little and glancing at the floor. What Alan doesn't realise, and we only learn later, is that John Profumo's grandson is actually sitting in the audience. \"We were campaigning for the abolition of the 11-plus,\" continues Alan, \"votes for 18s, all-day pub opening, and the implementation of commercial radio. The BBC had a stranglehold on the radio waves, see, and they didn't play rock and roll. This was back in 1964. Imagine that. A politician at the time - it might have been Alec Douglas-Home - said that our policies were just the rantings of raving loonies.\" Alan scans the room. \"As the years went by, commercial radio, votes for 18s, they all came into being. If those were raving- loony policies, we thought, let's become the Raving Loony Party. We added the word Monster because we genuinely thought we were going to be monster. Huge. If the people who didn't vote for anyone voted for us, we'd win! That's what we thought.\" \"ALL RIGHT!\" yells Barry from the seat next to mine. He is a little worse for wear from his day in the pub. \"TELL IT AS IT IS!\" There are coughs of surprise from the audience. By now, the Eton boys seem to have succumbed to the idea that they aren't in for an evening of lunacy. But Alan's story is unexpectedly fascinating, and he has our attention. \"Take those butter mountains,\" he says. \"What were they doing there? It seemed such a waste. So we said, 'Lets turn them into butter ski-slopes.'\" The children laugh and clap.\"And those beef mountains,\" says Alan. \"We said, 'Let's transport them down to the Sandwich Islands and then we can all have beef sandwiches!'\" The Eton boys cheer. Alan quietens them. \"You know what?\" he says. \"The Government got scared. They started handing back the butter and the milk and the cheese. They got the Sally Army to give them to the pensioners. Just because we made fun of it. See? Just because we highlighted it.\" There is a silence. Alan continues. \"Fifteen years ago we said, 'Let's have passports for pets. Dogs and cats. Don't put them in quarantine. Give them passports'. They laughed at us. Not that crazy, really.\" \"That's right!\" yells Barry, like an inebriated Greek chorus. \"That's RIGHT!\" Then it is time for the question-and- answer session. Those boys who had hoped for something more comedic from the evening take the opportunity to ask questions that might elicit a humorous response. \"Do you think people with beards should be allowed to stand for government?\" asks a boy from the back. There is some laughter. Alan looks baffled. \"Why shouldn't they?\" he replies. \"What's the problem with people with beards? I don't understand. Any other questions? Young boy, third row.\" \"Is your white suit a homage to Martin Bell?\" \"I don't know who Martin Bell is,\" says Alan. \"I'll tell you why I wear this white suit. I wear it as a tribute to Winston Churchill. He's my hero. That's who I copy. He is the only man in my lifetime who died to save us all. That's a fact.\" \"Good point!\" yells Barry. \"Next question?\" says Alan. \"What would you do if you became headmaster of this school?\" \"Well,\" says Alan, \"when I was at school, I got the cane, and I got the ruler. Let me tell you. It didn't do me any harm. What would I do if I was headmaster? I'd do it properly. Next question?\" \"Can I ask the man at the front . . .\" the questioner points at Barry, \". . . why he's a member of the Party?\" Barry blushes. \"Well,\" he says, rising to his feet. \"Alan helps you. See? He helps you rather than doesn't care about you. Could you have a pint with Tony Blair? No!\" Barry sits down. From his chair he hollers, \"We've been misled! We've been misled!\" \"Any more questions?\" asks Alan. \"I hear you're standing against Michael Portillo in the forthcoming Kensington and Chelsea by-election,\" says a boy. \"What are your policies for London?\" \"We're going to clean up the River Thames,\" says Alan. \"Fill it with alligators. You may laugh, but when you see alligator swamps on nature programmes, aren't they clean? So we'll fill the Thames with alligators, and get rid of them when there's no more pollution. Whether it works or not, it'll certainly make the Boat Race more interesting!\" There is a huge laugh and thunderous applause. And the debate is wrapped up. We leave for the journey back to London. Outside the debating hall, however, Alan is surrounded by Eton boys clutching autograph books. Richard Pratt, the social science master, stands to one side, watching this strange event unfold. \"We never get this,\" he says. \"This is even more adulation than Stephen Fry got. And Richard E Grant.\" Alan, encircled by a sea of boys in white bow ties and tails, beams. \"Excuse me,\" says one child, making his way through the crowd. \"I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciated your kind words about my great, great grandfather, Winston Churchill.\" Alan appears startled. \"Bloody hell,\" he exclaims. \"Thank you.\" Peter Stockton, the Minister for Rock And Roll, approaches Richard. \"I hear you have a wonderful music room,\" he says. \"Oh yes,\" says Richard. \"The facilities are quite extraordinary.\" \"I manage a band,\" says Peter, producing a business card from his pocket. \"They're called The Ravers. Pure rock and roll. How do we go about getting a gig here?\" Richard murmurs something about how Peter should approach the music master. Then he says to the children, \"Okay. Enough. This is a library, not a common room. On your way now.\" The boys dutifully file out. \"See?\" says Barry, putting a cigarette in his mouth. \"That's power you've got. That's real power.\" \"I'm sorry,\" says Richard, anxiously. \"This is a library. You can't smoke.\" \"Ha ha ha!\" says Barry, slapping Richard on the back. \"Fooled you! I do it just so people tell me I can't smoke and then I say, 'I'm not smoking! Look!'\" Barry points to the unlit cigarette. \"Look! I'm not smoking!\" Later on, as I drive the party leadership back on to the M4 towards west London, the mood is reflective. \"There's only one word for the Eton kids,\" says Barry. \"Delightful. They're delightful.\" \"It certainly is a breath of fresh air,\" says Peter. \"Where I come from,\" says Barry, \"the kids just slouch around housing estates telling you to piss off.\" \"It's another world,\" I sigh. \"Another world.\" \"It was a brilliant speech,\" says Barry. \"You spoke to the kids in a language they understand. Kids like that.\" \"When you get a reception like that, how can you fail?\" says Alan. \"Apparently, Prince William was in the audience, at the back,\" says Peter. \"At the end he was ushered out of another door.\" \"I can't believe Winston Churchill's great, great grandson came over to say hello,\" says Alan. \"That was thoughtful. Wasn't it thoughtful?\" The car goes quiet. We contemplate the events of the evening. I look in my rear-view mirror and I can see that Alan is smiling softly to himself. \"Don't vote Portillo! He may end up on your pillow! Don't vote Portillo! He may end up on your pillow!\" It is three weeks later, and the streets of Kensington are ringing to the sound of Monster Raving Loony by-electioneering. Alan and Peter are in a yellow mini-van, topped with a megaphone. Tonight, Alan is standing against Michael Portillo. This will be the Loonies' 60th election, and Alan's first since becoming leader. It is an important night. It will be seen as a barometer of the party's standing in the wake of Sutch's death. We park the car and head off to the Town Hall to collect our passes for the count. Unfortunately, we become lost on the way. We wander the evening streets of Kensington like headless chickens. \"Lost again,\" sighs Peter, ruefully. \"Well, that's Loony for you.\" The gates of a big house open as we walk past it, and a middle-aged black man wanders out. Peter asks him for directions. \"Left and left again,\" he replies. \"Thank you,\" we say. \"Huh!\" tuts Alan.\"Asking a black the way to the Town Hall!\" He mutters to himself in a what's-this-country-coming-to? kind of way. \"Will you stop being racist,\" says Peter, softly. At the Town Hall, a young Middle Eastern family are sitting in the reception, their suitcases piled up before them. \"I bet I know what's going on here,\" says Alan, loud enough for them to hear. \"Looking for a house. Mmm? Looking for a house on the social?\" Peter shoots Alan a look. I glance over at the family, who have obviously heard what Alan said. They seem uncomfortable and remain quiet - as if afraid that an unpleasant situation may arise if they say anything. It is a little shocking to see the chief Loony, in full Loony regalia, behaving in a fashion that one might expect from other loony political factions, but not from his. Coming from a political leader - even a Loony leader - this sort of thing is startling. Some time earlier, Alan had asked me about other stories I'd written, and I mentioned a documentary I made about the Ku-Klux Klan. \"I saw it,\" he said. \"I remember the scene where a bunch of niggers were shouting at some white bloke in a car park.\" There was a silence. \"I'm sorry?\" I said. \"All these niggers were shouting at some bloke,\" said Alan, merrily. Peter Stockton covertly shot Alan a stern glance. But Alan remained oblivious to the aftermath of his casual and unexpected racism. 'S o what's all this about you and black people?\" I ask him now. \"It's a joke,\" he says, immediately. \"I'm not racially prejudiced. None of us are. I'm not out to upset anyone. I wouldn't want to run anybody down. We've had some good times together, haven't we?\" \"Yes, we have,\" I say. \"It's just the same as when people make remarks about people who are gay. A joke comes up now and again.\" Alan pauses, anxiously. \"I know that a lot of ethnic people vote for us,\" he says. When I first met the Loonies, on the day of the Eton debate, Alan said a strange thing to me. He said, \"I hope you're sympathetic to our cause.\" I furrowed my brow. I didn't think they had a cause. I thought they just dressed up. But I nodded vaguely. I very much doubted, after all, that I would be unsympathetic. The longer I spend with them, however, the more I understand what Alan stands for. The Loonies portray themselves, essentially, as situationist anarchists. But they are more than that. Their disenfranchisement stems from what they see as the liberal erosion of Olde England. The 1999 Raving Loony newsletter, the Raving Chronicle, has bikini-clad pin-ups, and a parody of a Chinese take-away menu. The restaurant is called the Slitinese, and the joke dishes include \"Kow Pu\", \"Ars Pik\", \"Ho Mo\" and \"Yu Kum Steaming-Hot Custard\". \"What are your views on Britain entering Europe?\" I ask him. \"I'll tell you,\" he replies. \"You'll laugh, but just you wait. Ten or 15 years from now, it'll be government policy. We'll declare Great Britain the off-shore tax haven for all of Europe. We can tell those gnomes of Zurich to sling their fish-hooks. Then Europe will be ruled by London, rather than London ruled by Europe. And we'll have won. See?\" Alan grins. \"We'll have won!\" Back at the pub that the Loonies have made their base - the Churchill - we hook up with other Loonies for some last-minute electioneering. About half-a-dozen have turned up from across the country to offer their support. \"Excuse me!\" they yell at passers-by. \"Have you voted yet?\" \"Oh!\" replies one. \"I thought you were Morris Dancers. I'm glad you're not.\" \"How come you never see a Jewish Morris dancer?\" asks a Loony. \"You'd have to be a complete prick to be a Morris Dancer!\" \"Where's Screaming Lord Sutch?\" asks another passer-by. \"He's dead.\" replies a Loony. \"Oh.\" A pause. \"Sorry.\" \"Excuse me, Miss? Have you voted yet?\" The woman walks on in silence. \"I bet no one's gone down on you for months, love!\" they shout after her. Then a conversation ensues about whether Peter Stockton should, actually, refer to himself as the \"Minister for Rock and Roll\". \"Sutchy told Nick that he was the Minister for Rock and Roll.\" \"No,\" corrects Peter. \"Nick is the Midlands Minister for Rock and Roll.\" This conversation takes place with only a little humour. \"Sutchy gave me that title.\" There is a silence. \"Oh,\" says Peter, with soft finality. \"You can call me the Minister for Boogie Woogie.\" \"How about the Minister Without Portillo?\" suggests someone. \"That's gorgeous!\" \"How about the Minster Without Portaloo?\" \"That's a gem. We should use that one.\" The ghost of Screaming Lord Sutch is forever there. When the Loonies sing an impromptu song in a local pub, Alan yells, \"Three cheers for Screaming Lord Sutch!\" And in the reception of Alan's hotel in Devon (he is a hotelier by trade), there is a bright orange urn that reads, \"Ashes of Screaming Lord Sutch\". Inside are the contents of an old ashtray that was found in Sutch's home after his death. \"He committed suicide on my birthday,\" says Alan. \"Hung himself with a skipping rope. June 16th. Five months ago. I'll never forget that day.\" \"I had no idea he'd do it,\" says Barry. \"I guess his mother's death affected him in a big way. But we don't want him down as a mummy's boy. He had his high days and his low days like we all do. Hopefully you get through the low days. He was never morose in front of me. He was never down. But deep down where he lives . . . you just don't know what goes on down there.\" Barry pauses. \"Fuck me. It's easy to cancel yourself out. Easy to think you're not worth anything.\" \"How did you all hear of his death?\" I ask. \"The Daily Telegraph phoned me,\" says Alan. \"I said, 'It's a bit late to be phoning Monster Raving Loony headquarters, isn't it?' He said, 'You haven't heard the news.'\" Alan pauses. \"I knew straight away. I knew it would happen one day. Still, I said, 'You're not really from the Daily Telegraph.' He said, 'Unfortunately, I am . . .'\" There is a silence. \"I felt bloody annoyed,\" says Alan. \"If he'd been run over by a bus I'd have shed a tear. But there was so much going on for him. He'd just done that breakfast cereal advert, so he had money coming in.\" \"I'll tell you,\" says Peter, \"he'd have wanted that Coco Pops money to go to party funds. But we haven't seen a penny of it.\" \"What sort of man was he?\" I ask. \"He didn't drink and he didn't smoke,\" says Peter. \"He never swore. In all the years I knew him he only swore once.\" Peter pauses, then adds, \"But it wasn't in mixed company.\" \"Where was it?\" \"It was at the Winchester by-election. They didn't like the Loonies standing in Winchester. He just got frustrated. He said, 'bloody'.\" There is a silence. \"But I'm being too open,\" says Peter. In the wake of Sutch's death, a leadership contest was fought at Alan's hotel, the Golden Lion, and Alan was elected party leader, along with his cat, Mandu. A few days after the Eton debate, there was a Monster Raving Loony-related question on the Channel 4 quiz show, Fifteen To One. \"Which political party has a cat as its joint leader?\" \"The bloke didn't know the answer,\" says Alan. \"He said, 'Is it Labour?'\" Alan laughs. \"But you know what that question means, don't you? It means we're there. We're there.\" Now, the party is looking to Alan for direction. Since the earliest days, Alan was always the more sober policy man behind the eccentric figurehead of the Screaming Lord -which is why he's been so keen to promote what he considers the party's genuine contribution to the nation's political landscape. He is also the only Loony candidate to hold political office. He is the current mayor of Ashburton, Devon. \"I never wear the white outfit while I'm undertaking my mayoral duties,\" he says. \"When I'm mayor, I'm Clark Kent. When I wear the white suit, I'm Superman.\" Later that evening, back at the Churchill, some local journalists have assembled to write funny, light-hearted columns about the by-election. Alan reminisces about our time at Eton. \"Weren't those kids great?\" says Alan. \"Just great.\" \"You went to Eton?\" ask the journalists. \"Alan did a lecture on politics,\" explains Peter. \"And Prince William was there.\" \"Really?\" \"You should have seen the reception Alan got,\" says Peter. He looks to me for confirmation. \"Biggest turn out they ever had,\" I nod. \"It was euphoric.\" \"Alan now has very real credibility with the future leaders of Britain,\" says Peter. \"Some serious bridges were built that night.\" Closing time comes - and so we head to Holland Park School for the count. \"What result will you be happy with tonight?\" I ask Alan, on the way out. \"Two-fifty,\" he replies. \"That's my benchmark. I put a bet on myself with William Hill, and if I get 250 or more I'll get the \u00a3500 deposit back.\" \"We'll come fourth,\" says Peter. \"Just you watch.\" \"Fourth or fifth,\" says Alan. \"Definitely fourth,\" says Peter, confidently. \"Who's going to beat us?\" \"I'd like to see the faces of the Pro-Europe Conservative Party when we beat them,\" says Alan. \"We did once. I wonder how they felt to have been beaten by the Monster Raving Loony Party!\" \"Are you excited?\" I ask Alan. \"Oh God, yes,\" he grins, with a boyish enthusiasm. \"I'm so excited underneath it all.\" Although only six Loonies will be admitted to the count, a group of around 40 merry-makers has somehow formed, all of whom expect Peter to get them in to the election hall, past the heavy police security. Some of the new hangers-on - who are not Loonies and have appeared from nowhere - are drunk and aggressive. They decide that Gavan, Weekend Guardian's photographer, is a \"wank-face Tory twat police lackey cunt\" for telling them it is rude to smash beer bottles against the wall. Peter has a complex job on his hands. He must somehow separate the genuine Loonies from the drunken thugs, while averting an all-out fight, which is beginning to brew. \"All the Loonies must cross the road,\" whispers Peter to me, \"and then cross back again. Pass it on to the other Loonies.\" To make matters worse, he is finding it difficult to control some of his own members. We are yards from the school and Peter, a stickler for decorum and protocol, wants Alan to lead the group through the gates. \"Don't jump the gun, darling . . .\" He addresses a Loony woman, the Minister for Pets And Poo-Poo. \"You're charging in like a fucking rhinoceros. Alan is the leader. He must go in first.\" \"Sorry,\" she says. \"We'll put it down to a lack of experience, darling,\" snaps Peter through gritted teeth. Then Alan disappears. He has apparently decided to pop off for a quick sleep in the back of a party member's car. We set about trying to find him, while attempting to distance ourselves from the increasingly angry pub brawlers. In the midst of the mayhem, Peter looks frustrated and upset. I can see how passionately he feels about the party, about observing the proper etiquette. Peter is different from the others. He is upper-middle class, for a start, and has been a successful entrepreneur. He once managed Stringfellows and he co-owned two central London clubs, Lennons and Johnny O'Boogies, with Cynthia Lennon. I wonder how Peter feels about Alan's inopportune racism, which can only be a hindrance to the respectability of the Loonies - something that Peter quite obviously cares deeply about. \"Alan isn't a racist,\" he says. \"Not really. The only thing he eats is curry. And that's Indian food. Maybe he thinks it's funny, this colonial guy in the white suit and a white hat, saying colonial things.\" Peter pauses. \"Don't forget,\" he says, \"we're only the Monster Raving Loony Party. You don't have to be too hard on us. We're not something to be annihilated with AK47s.\" Nonetheless, the Loonies, under Alan, are striving for political respectability - Peter himself says they should change their name to the Common Sense Party - and, like all politicians, they should be careful when a Guardian journalist, holding a notepad, is standing next to them writing down everything they say. Alan reappears, awake and ready for action, and we recruit some nearby policemen to help siphon the real Loonies off from the drunks. And then we enter the school. \"Are you planning to say anything to Michael Portillo?\" I ask Alan. \"Oh yes,\" he says. \"I'm going to say 'Hello Mr Port-a-loo. I mean, Hello Mr Port-a-cabin.' Then I'm going to hand him this.\" Alan shows me a brown envelope in which he's carrying a Monster Raving Loony Million Pound Note. This is Alan's stunt against political sleaze. If Portillo takes the gift, the Loonies will issue a press release saying that he has accepted a \u00a31-million Loony bribe in a brown paper envelope. We drink coffee, smoke cigarettes. A few journalists approach Alan. \"I suppose you'll have got some sympathy votes, what with Sutch dying and all,\" suggests one. \"Got any jokes?\" asks the man from the London Evening Standard. \"Jokes or anecdotes?\" asks Alan. \"Anecdotes will do,\" he says, \"as long as they're funny.\" Alan begins a story about how he mislaid his deposit on the way to the Town Hall. We are interrupted by a commotion from down the corridor. Michael Portillo has arrived. The camera crews stampede, and Alan is lost in the hubbub, clutching his Monster Raving Loony Million Pound Note. \"Mr Portillo!\" he yells. But everyone else is yelling \"Mr Portillo\", too, and Alan cannot get within a mile of him. Luckily, however, we have passes for the counting floor, and the other journalists don't. So we follow Portillo inside. Alan nervously approaches him. \"Mr Portillo?\" he says, his hand shaking a little. \"Hello,\" says Michael Portillo, extending his own hand. \"I have a gift for you,\" says Alan. Michael Portillo looks down at the brown envelope. He twigs. \"Not tonight thank you,\" he says. He turns his back. \"Hah!\" says Alan to whoever will listen. \"Michael Portillo has refused a \u00a31 million note!\" But the joke isn't quite as good now. Three hours later, the results. It is now the early hours of the morning. There are 18 candidates - ranging from Rainbow George's Lovebucket Party to the pro- Cannabis Party. Dressed all in white, with his huge hat, Alan is by far the most distinctive of all the candidates. He stands out - a flash of white among the dark colours. \"Alan Hope, Official Monster Raving Loony Party . . . 20.\" Alan punches the air. A small cheer goes up from his supporters, hesitantly, for it is a dreadful result. \"Michael Portillo . . . 11,004.\" When all the results have been announced, we realise the sad news that the Loonies have come an appalling 17th out of 18 candidates. Only the Stop Tobacco Companies From Harming Our Children Party fares worse, with 15 votes. In the long, strange history of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party - 30 years in opposition and 60 constituency elections - this is their worst result ever. Michael Portillo descends from the stage to be congratulated by his entourage, who are dressed from head to toe in blue. The blueness of Portillo's entourage makes them look like they're in costume, too. He shakes their hands briskly and he gives his wife a peck on the cheek. Then he hurries out of the door to a waiting car and is whisked away. \"Twenty votes,\" I say. \"Jesus Christ, that's dreadful,\" agrees Peter. It is 2.30am. The Loonies are the last to leave, along with a few policemen. \"I'm going to demand a recount!\" yells Alan to no one. \"Come back everyone!\" \"How do you feel?\" I ask him. \"Wonderful!\" he says. A few Loonies gather sadly around him in commiseration. We all know how much the party means to him. This is not lunacy for Alan. This is real. He attempts to buoy the Loonies up. \"It's a party record,\" he says. \"Our lowest vote ever! Any record is good.\" The only thing Alan admits being upset about is that he wasn't allowed to make a speech. \"I paid my \u00a3500, too, just like Portillo did,\" he says. \"Why was he allowed a speech and not me? I'm considering making a complaint.\" \"What would you have said?\" I ask. \"I would have said, 'Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and a very special thanks to our spiritual leader, Screaming Lord Sutch.'\" Alan raises his eyes skyward. This is the gesture he would have made. We wander outside into the dark, silent streets of Kensington. \"Twenty votes,\" I murmur. \"A new Loony record,\" says Alan. \"Lowest ever! Don't worry. We'll turn it to our advantage. Uh. We're still looking for that nil points that are very elusive! We're nearly there, but then 20 silly people voted for us! Uh. This is the Loony Party going back to basics . . . Nil points! Ha ha!\" At that, Alan disappears, smiling, into the land of comedy inspiration",

      "bodyText": "The merry-go-round of technical delays afflicting the Millennium Wheel took another turn last night when fresh doubts were raised about whether it would open next month. The launch of the \u00a335m wheel on London's south bank was stopped on New Year's Eve by health and safety experts, much to the embarrassment of the prime minister, who had turned up to cut the tape. Then a mid-January start was also scrapped and now the trouble-hit attraction is in danger of missing a February 1 deadline. The fault in a clutch mechanism which held up the original opening is now thought to be much more serious than initially thought, and the devices on all 32 capsules will have to be replaced. The clutches, a key safety feature, are supposed to stabilise capsules on the 450ft ride in the event of a power cut of major mechanical fault. British Airways, who sponsor the wheel, which is also known as the BA London Eye, insisted the February 1 deadline would be met and claimed there might even be preview rides before then. \"There is no problem with the design of the clutch,\" a BA spokesman said. \"This has been a manufacturing fault. \"The German makers of the clutches are working as fast as they can with British engineers to rectify the situation.\" He said that if it had been a design fault, it would have been much more serious. \"This is not an insurmountable problem, it's relatively straightforward and quick.\" However, yesterday's issue of New Civil Engineer magazine said remaking, fitting and testing the new parts could take up to a month, without taking teething problems into account. No one at Stromag, the German engineering company which is making a new batch of strengthened clutches, was available for comment. Despite its woes, the wheel is already a much loved feature of the capital's skyline. More than half a million tickets have been sold and BA hopes to carry 2.5m passengers on it in its first 12 months, although independent research indicates that this figure could reach 4m. The 250 competition-winning guests who were due to ride the wheel on December 31 were given a champagne dinner by BA instead and the chance to travel anywhere in the world for free. BA confirmed that when the new clutches are finished the wheel will be tested by John Roberts and his team of three engineers, the safety experts who cancelled the New Year's Eve opening.",

      "body": "<p>A magazine article of 30 years ago famously asked \"What is Princess Margaret for?\" People are now asking the same about the Dome - a much fairer question. Even President Chirac, leader of a nation that has no embarrassment or qualms about great national projects, on being shown a display of models of the Dome in London two years ago asked: \"But what is it for?\"</p> <p>I asked myself the same question the day I accepted the privilege of being involved in the Dome in the summer of 1997. Attempts to answer the question have struggled to be heard. My answer, and the answers of all of us associated with the creative process, have too often been drowned out by other debates, considered more \"newsworthy\", about whether the Dome is not religious enough, or too religious; whether it is too heavily subsidised by commercial sponsorship, or relies too much on Lottery money; whether it is too dumbed-down or too elitist - and even what the precise sex of the Body Zone should be.</p> <p>The controversies along the way have given a lot of people a lot of fun, and provided a lot of newspaper columnists with a lot of material. But they have also sparked off some genuine debate about issues that are rarely aired - our national identity, the role of religion in our society, whether we do things as families any more, and whether we have anything to celebrate.</p> <p>Let me explain our starting point. We have a lot to celebrate. Firstly, I believe that we are the most creative nation in the world - and much of our future prosperity will depend on our ability to turn our ideas into businesses and jobs. So the Dome - as a landmark national exhibition - is very much of its time. Through bringing together a talented team of different architects, designers, artists, musicians, software engineers and performers, it houses under one roof a collection of attractions that are as diverse as the nation itself. There is no single voice in the Dome.</p> <p>Previous great exhibitions in this country have also been of their time. In those days, the great and the good created tableaux and then lifted the curtain for a moment to allow the public to gaze in awe at what their betters had achieved. That was then.</p> <p>The Dome is designed to reflect the current reality of our society at the start of the 21st century. The here and now, a time when individuals are taking more and more responsibility for their own lives. We have therefore created an exhibition that doesn't preach and doesn't offer certainties.</p> <p>Instead, each of the 14 zones covers a different aspect of human life and opens a window on the choices we must make for the future. We have tried to make them all fun and intriguing, and therefore entertaining. It is up to each visitor to decide which of these zones they would like to see, and to take away what they will from the experience. We have to appeal to all peoples of all ages. But the common theme is that our destiny is in our own hands - and that whether this millennium is better or worse than the last is up to all of us individually and collectively.</p> <p>That unifying theme is explored from three starting points: who we are - covered in the Body, Mind, Self Portrait and Faith zones; what we do - in Talk, Journey, Work, Learning, Money, Play, Rest; and where we live - in Living Island, Shared Ground and Home Planet.</p> <p>The zones are ranged around the vast central arena where up to 12,000 people at a time can see the Millennium Show. This is a fable of the human experience told through a spectacular love story with music by Peter Gabriel, in which the performers fly and dance 140ft above the ground.</p> <p>This is the part of the Dome that everyone enjoys together. In an age when so much of what we do is solitary - working at a keyboard, surfing the internet or playing computer games, watching TV in our living rooms - there is still magic in the shared experience. And the Dome is deliberately conceived as a place where people come to learn, to have fun and to be excited - together.</p> <p>T hat is something you can't get out of a book or on the world wide web. When the show starts the audience takes part, sitting and standing amongst the performers as they set up and as the props are put in place. Every zone is not just something you look at - you get inside, you play with toys, you leave your own mark.</p> <p>When I joined the project I assumed that we were in need of a single creative director. The fact that we didn't go down that route has turned out to be a surprise bonus. However, to have entrusted creative custody of the entire project to a single pair of hands would have run counter to everything that we believe the Dome should stand for - namely inclusiveness and plurality. Nobody, no single person, owns the Dome. We've got a much greater variety on offer than would otherwise have been the case and a cacophony of different voices grabbing people's attention.</p> <p>The Dome is a small town of different buildings each with their own colours, shapes and appeal. Zaha Hadid's angular, gravity-defying Mind Zone nestles between the graceful curves of Faith by Eva Jiricna and the Richard Rogers Partnership's Rest Zone, which is a giant technicolour lozenge with a dreamy sound and light show inside.</p> <p>Variety and plurality, not uniformity and predictability, are the Dome's greatest strengths. In the City of London, Richard Rogers and Norman Foster sit side by side with Wren and Hawksmoor, and the Dome would not be of its age if it didn't reflect the diversity of the world we live in.</p> <p>Each poll of visitors who have actually been to the Dome indicates that the exhibiton has relevance, meaning and value for all its visitors, whatever their age or background. The five independent polls so far show overwhelmingly positive reaction, with 80 to 90% of visitors saying they have enjoyed their day and around three-quarters saying they would recommend it to friends.

      "bodyText": "A magazine article of 30 years ago famously asked \"What is Princess Margaret for?\" People are now asking the same about the Dome - a much fairer question. Even President Chirac, leader of a nation that has no embarrassment or qualms about great national projects, on being shown a display of models of the Dome in London two years ago asked: \"But what is it for?\" I asked myself the same question the day I accepted the privilege of being involved in the Dome in the summer of 1997. Attempts to answer the question have struggled to be heard. My answer, and the answers of all of us associated with the creative process, have too often been drowned out by other debates, considered more \"newsworthy\", about whether the Dome is not religious enough, or too religious; whether it is too heavily subsidised by commercial sponsorship, or relies too much on Lottery money; whether it is too dumbed-down or too elitist - and even what the precise sex of the Body Zone should be. The controversies along the way have given a lot of people a lot of fun, and provided a lot of newspaper columnists with a lot of material. But they have also sparked off some genuine debate about issues that are rarely aired - our national identity, the role of religion in our society, whether we do things as families any more, and whether we have anything to celebrate. Let me explain our starting point. We have a lot to celebrate. Firstly, I believe that we are the most creative nation in the world - and much of our future prosperity will depend on our ability to turn our ideas into businesses and jobs. So the Dome - as a landmark national exhibition - is very much of its time. Through bringing together a talented team of different architects, designers, artists, musicians, software engineers and performers, it houses under one roof a collection of attractions that are as diverse as the nation itself. There is no single voice in the Dome. Previous great exhibitions in this country have also been of their time. In those days, the great and the good created tableaux and then lifted the curtain for a moment to allow the public to gaze in awe at what their betters had achieved. That was then. The Dome is designed to reflect the current reality of our society at the start of the 21st century. The here and now, a time when individuals are taking more and more responsibility for their own lives. We have therefore created an exhibition that doesn't preach and doesn't offer certainties. Instead, each of the 14 zones covers a different aspect of human life and opens a window on the choices we must make for the future. We have tried to make them all fun and intriguing, and therefore entertaining. It is up to each visitor to decide which of these zones they would like to see, and to take away what they will from the experience. We have to appeal to all peoples of all ages. But the common theme is that our destiny is in our own hands - and that whether this millennium is better or worse than the last is up to all of us individually and collectively. That unifying theme is explored from three starting points: who we are - covered in the Body, Mind, Self Portrait and Faith zones; what we do - in Talk, Journey, Work, Learning, Money, Play, Rest; and where we live - in Living Island, Shared Ground and Home Planet. The zones are ranged around the vast central arena where up to 12,000 people at a time can see the Millennium Show. This is a fable of the human experience told through a spectacular love story with music by Peter Gabriel, in which the performers fly and dance 140ft above the ground. This is the part of the Dome that everyone enjoys together. In an age when so much of what we do is solitary - working at a keyboard, surfing the internet or playing computer games, watching TV in our living rooms - there is still magic in the shared experience. And the Dome is deliberately conceived as a place where people come to learn, to have fun and to be excited - together. T hat is something you can't get out of a book or on the world wide web. When the show starts the audience takes part, sitting and standing amongst the performers as they set up and as the props are put in place. Every zone is not just something you look at - you get inside, you play with toys, you leave your own mark. When I joined the project I assumed that we were in need of a single creative director. The fact that we didn't go down that route has turned out to be a surprise bonus. However, to have entrusted creative custody of the entire project to a single pair of hands would have run counter to everything that we believe the Dome should stand for - namely inclusiveness and plurality. Nobody, no single person, owns the Dome. We've got a much greater variety on offer than would otherwise have been the case and a cacophony of different voices grabbing people's attention. The Dome is a small town of different buildings each with their own colours, shapes and appeal. Zaha Hadid's angular, gravity-defying Mind Zone nestles between the graceful curves of Faith by Eva Jiricna and the Richard Rogers Partnership's Rest Zone, which is a giant technicolour lozenge with a dreamy sound and light show inside. Variety and plurality, not uniformity and predictability, are the Dome's greatest strengths. In the City of London, Richard Rogers and Norman Foster sit side by side with Wren and Hawksmoor, and the Dome would not be of its age if it didn't reflect the diversity of the world we live in. Each poll of visitors who have actually been to the Dome indicates that the exhibiton has relevance, meaning and value for all its visitors, whatever their age or background. The five independent polls so far show overwhelmingly positive reaction, with 80 to 90% of visitors saying they have enjoyed their day and around three-quarters saying they would recommend it to friends. It looks as if public opinion is one step ahead of the critics and the pundits - and not for the first time. So come with an open mind. I am confident you will find something to savour inside the Dome. This is a new century and an age when the choice is ours - and no longer that of the great and good, the elites and the other self- appointed arbiters of taste who have told us what to like for so long. There may be some who find that idea a touch threatening. Michael Grade is a director of the New Millennium Experience Company.",

Peter Tatchell, spokesman for the gay rights lobby group, OutRage!, accused Mr Souter of using his millions to fan the flames of bigotry and prejudice. \"He is behaving like the business leaders in the deep south of America who funded the 1950s campaign to maintain racial segregation. I hope commuters, trade unionists, churches, politicians and companies that support gay hu man rights will boycott Stagecoach.\" Mr Souter, who is notoriously unwilling to cooperate with the media, was yesterday unavailable for comment. His spokesman, however, denied the Stagecoach boss was homophobic. \"Mr Souter believes that this is an important issue of democracy. It is not homophobic. It is essential that all Scottish parents realise what the implications are of scrapping clause 28 and the kind of explicit material which could then be forced on their children in the classroom.\" Mr Souter, the father of four school-age children, gave the money through his charitable Souter Foundation. His intervention is an embarrassment to the Scottish executive, which last year appointed him to a prestigious \"champion of change\" adviser post on local government. Board members of the association, which represents 84% of Scotland's 2,400 school boards, plan to launch a campaign against the repeal of Section 2a of the local government act 1986 - widely known as clause or section 28 - on Wednesday. \"We view this as an issue of democracy,\" said the treasurer, Alan Smith. \"We're trying to redress the balance and we will use the financial support to highlight what section 28 is about.\" However the SSBA board has been criticised by equality groups for failing to consult members and launching the campaign unilaterally. A spokesman for the Scottish executive said the campaign run by Mr Souter and the SSBA would not change its mind on the issue. Moves to repeal section 28 in the forthcoming ethical standards bill enjoy cross-party support north of the border. The SNP said the clause should be repealed as soon as possible. The Scottish Conservatives were the only party at Holyrood to back Mr Souter's donation. The education spokesman, Brian Monteith, said: \"It is a brave decision in a politically hostile climate.\" Both Childen First, the Scottish arm of the NSPCC, and Childline are in favour of repeal.

(That's in radio; in film, even the second assistant trainee tea-boy gets a credit.) Yet with changing technology and costs, radio drama is no longer primarily made in a studio, from a fixed script. Increasingly it's a multitrack confection, created post-production by the Russell-Paviers of the world. </p> <p>Here, Dryden and Russell-Pavier have created a wondrous soundtrack, with not only a convincing dripping toilet but also the squeak of credit-card transactions, shop doors opening and the panoply of sounds that make up American daily life.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Davos, the hot-air festival (sorry, \"world economic forum\") held annually at the Swiss ski resort, will this year be graced by the first rather than second lord of the treasury. With not a crisis in sight and the world economy a sea of tranquillity, Tony Blair is arriving to participate in a panel discussion on leadership in the 21st century. Computer tycoon Michael Dell will sketch the ideal political leader for the new era, and Mr Blair will do likewise for the ideal business leader. Gordon Brown - possibly repelled by the prospect of all this mutual backscratching - will not be attending, we hear. His boss, meanwhile, will have the chance to meet 29 heads of state and government and, more importantly, 1,200 people representing between 60% and 80% of global industrial production (trade union leaders? No - chief executives, stupid!); </p> <p>\u0095 Back home, Sir George Mathewson, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was spotted this week at London's Savoy with his youthful deputy Fred Goodwin, enjoying dinner after meetings with institutional investors to win backing for the bank's assault on NatWest. Who should arrive but NatWest top brass Sir David Rowland, Ron Sandler and new recruit Gordon Pell, all dining with their wives. Sir David told Sir George he was \"delighted\" to see his attacker, but peace talks did not follow. Meanwhile, Royal Bank's image as a ferocious predator is fast being undermined by its sponsorship department; envelopes printed especially for the bank declare it to be official sponsor of the National Cycle Path. A little herbivorous, surely, for NatWest's would-be savager? </p> <p>\u0095 Peace, meanwhile, has broken out (sort of) on the bloody battlefield of French banking. For years relations between the country's private banks on the one hand and the mutuals and co-operative banks on the other have been sulphurous, with the former's lobby group - the Association Fran\u00e7aise des Banques - demanding an end to covert government backing for the non-commercial outfits. All that, however, belongs to the 20th century. At a dinner on Tuesday, in the presence of new finance minister Christian Sautter, association president Michel Freyche confirmed bankers of different stripes are to merge into the new F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise. The delicate prenuptial negotiations will fall to Mr Freyche's successor, Bernard Morel, whose Marseilles background may help him, er, break any log jams. Agenda item one is the HQ of the federation; gourmands are hoping for the existing association base in rue Lafayette in Paris's ninth district, with its hospitable dining room and agreeable views over the nearby Place de l'Opera; </p> <p>\u0095 Elsewhere in European banking, the union's central bank - issuer of that multi-national Kleenex the euro - seeks translators with the following \"mother tongue\" lan guages: Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish. Is the absence of English another penalty for our euro-exclusion? Not exactly. The successful applicants will work on \"the translation of texts principally from English\"; </p> <p>\u0095 Back home, TransTec, the troubled engineer pushed into receivership last month after the discovery of an undisclosed \u00a312m claim against the firm by customer Ford, did send one of two subliminal signals in its last annual report hinting at what may be to come. Regarding \"payment of creditors, TransTec declared: \"The company does not follow any code or standard on payment practice.\" Too right. In fact, TransTec paid \u00a38m of Ford's claim without telling anyone. Then there is one of TransTec's few exceptions during 1997-98 to the combined code of best practice on corporate governance: \"Until June 12 1998, the audit committee consisted of only two members\", which may explain why the \u00a312m did not show up in the audit. Finally, there is the section on \"internal financial control\", which warns: \"[It] is to be noted that any system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\" How very true; </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, with the Y2K bug expensively squashed underfoot, BT made a flying leap this week into a new century of instant communication. Callers from London to the south coast at 10.20am on Tuesday were greeted with: \"The telephone network is busy at the moment. Please try again later. You have not been charged for this call.\" Overwhelmed by nostalgia for the days of party lines and button B, our caller left it half an hour, only to learn at 10.50am that the entire Sussex network was apparently out of action. Alexander Graham Bell's mobile number, anyone?</p>",

With not a crisis in sight and the world economy a sea of tranquillity, Tony Blair is arriving to participate in a panel discussion on leadership in the 21st century. Computer tycoon Michael Dell will sketch the ideal political leader for the new era, and Mr Blair will do likewise for the ideal business leader. Gordon Brown - possibly repelled by the prospect of all this mutual backscratching - will not be attending, we hear. His boss, meanwhile, will have the chance to meet 29 heads of state and government and, more importantly, 1,200 people representing between 60% and 80% of global industrial production (trade union leaders? No - chief executives, stupid!); \u0095 Back home, Sir George Mathewson, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, was spotted this week at London's Savoy with his youthful deputy Fred Goodwin, enjoying dinner after meetings with institutional investors to win backing for the bank's assault on NatWest. Who should arrive but NatWest top brass Sir David Rowland, Ron Sandler and new recruit Gordon Pell, all dining with their wives. Sir David told Sir George he was \"delighted\" to see his attacker, but peace talks did not follow. Meanwhile, Royal Bank's image as a ferocious predator is fast being undermined by its sponsorship department; envelopes printed especially for the bank declare it to be official sponsor of the National Cycle Path. A little herbivorous, surely, for NatWest's would-be savager? \u0095 Peace, meanwhile, has broken out (sort of) on the bloody battlefield of French banking. For years relations between the country's private banks on the one hand and the mutuals and co-operative banks on the other have been sulphurous, with the former's lobby group - the Association Fran\u00e7aise des Banques - demanding an end to covert government backing for the non-commercial outfits. All that, however, belongs to the 20th century. At a dinner on Tuesday, in the presence of new finance minister Christian Sautter, association president Michel Freyche confirmed bankers of different stripes are to merge into the new F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise. The delicate prenuptial negotiations will fall to Mr Freyche's successor, Bernard Morel, whose Marseilles background may help him, er, break any log jams. Agenda item one is the HQ of the federation; gourmands are hoping for the existing association base in rue Lafayette in Paris's ninth district, with its hospitable dining room and agreeable views over the nearby Place de l'Opera; \u0095 Elsewhere in European banking, the union's central bank - issuer of that multi-national Kleenex the euro - seeks translators with the following \"mother tongue\" lan guages: Danish, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish and Finnish. Is the absence of English another penalty for our euro-exclusion? Not exactly. The successful applicants will work on \"the translation of texts principally from English\"; \u0095 Back home, TransTec, the troubled engineer pushed into receivership last month after the discovery of an undisclosed \u00a312m claim against the firm by customer Ford, did send one of two subliminal signals in its last annual report hinting at what may be to come. Regarding \"payment of creditors, TransTec declared: \"The company does not follow any code or standard on payment practice.\" Too right. In fact, TransTec paid \u00a38m of Ford's claim without telling anyone. Then there is one of TransTec's few exceptions during 1997-98 to the combined code of best practice on corporate governance: \"Until June 12 1998, the audit committee consisted of only two members\", which may explain why the \u00a312m did not show up in the audit. Finally, there is the section on \"internal financial control\", which warns: \"[It] is to be noted that any system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\" How very true; \u0095 Finally, with the Y2K bug expensively squashed underfoot, BT made a flying leap this week into a new century of instant communication. Callers from London to the south coast at 10.20am on Tuesday were greeted with: \"The telephone network is busy at the moment. Please try again later. You have not been charged for this call.\" Overwhelmed by nostalgia for the days of party lines and button B, our caller left it half an hour, only to learn at 10.50am that the entire Sussex network was apparently out of action. Alexander Graham Bell's mobile number, anyone?",

I know that they cannot all be bad or unnatural, for they include a large number of the people of this country - and of the peoples of most other countries, for that matter. But I find capital punishment so abhorrent myself that it is difficult for me to understand how perfectly nice people can be in favour of it. I just have to accept the fact and to believe that they are not worse people as a result. All understanding deserts me, however, when I think about the governors of Texas and Florida, the sons of former president George Bush. George W Bush Jr, who is running for president, and his brother, Jeb, seem to be not just in favour of the death penalty, but in love with it. </p> <p>During his five years as governor of the US's largest state, George W has presided over the executions of 111 men and one woman, far more than the governor of any other state. His policy is to ensure that, with almost no exceptions, death sentences are carried out. The nearest he comes to mercy is to grant a request by one condemned man, as he has just done, that he be put to death on the night of the full moon. Among the seven people due to be executed in Texas this month while George W is away campaigning for the presidency in Iowa and New Hampshire is a man who was only 17 when he committed his crime. </p> <p>George W has achieved his position as America's most prolific executioner by speeding up appeal procedures and running a clemency system that a federal judge has described as excessively secretive and legally unsound. It has also been condemned by Amnesty International as violating international standards of human rights. As governor, George W cannot grant or deny applications for clemency without the agreement of an 18-member parole board, but all the board's members have been appointed by him and have never been known to disagree with him. The board operates without guidelines, does not explain its decisions, and does not even meet to discuss cases. Members review cases on their own and then fax in their votes. George W recently quashed an attempt to get clemency applications heard in public, saying this would only make people \"rant and rail\" and \"emotionalise the process\". He also killed off a bill in the state legislature, which would have banned executions of the mentally retarded. (It will be recalled that George W is not the first state governor running for president who is hard-hearted towards the mentally ill: Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted his presidential campaign in 1992 to approve the execution of a murderer with brain damage.) </p> <p>In Florida, Governor Jeb Bush has been looking on enviously at his elder brother's achievement. Although Florida is the third-ranking state after Virginia in the number of people it executes, it has only managed to kill 44 people in the 23 years since the Supreme Court allowed re-instatement of capital punishment, whereas Texas has killed a magnificent 199. So, last week, Jeb summoned a special session of the state legislature to approve a speeded-up, Texas-style appeals system, which, he says, should reduce from 14 years to five the average time between a murderer's sentencing and his execution. The legislators heard the evidence of a man who spent nine-and-a-half years on Florida's death row before being unconditionally pardoned when another man confessed to the murders of which he was convicted. They were unmoved when he pointed out that, under the new appeals system, he would have been dead long ago. </p> <p> The reform of the appeals system was linked to another piece of legislation that changed Florida's method of execution from the electric chair to lethal injection. This was presented as a humane measure after some horribly bungled electrocutions in which two victims caught fire and one gushed blood from his nose. Its main purpose, however, was to pre-empt a Supreme Court review of whether Florida's use of the electric chair is \"cruel and unusual punishment\", which rather ignores that lethal injection is cruel and unusual, too, especially when administered, as it was in Texas last month, to a man who was saved from an attempted suicide in order to be formally put to death immediately afterwards. During his execution, the man vomited up a black charcoal liquid he had been made to drink to negate the effects of the pills he had swallowed. </p> <p>Apparently, the US electorate can spot no inconsistency between the Bush family's passion for killing people and the \"compassionate conservatism\" with which George W hopes to win the presidency. Alas for that small minority of Americans who oppose the death penalty, there is no one else worth voting for, since there is not a single candidate, Republican or Democrat, who doesn't support it.</p>",

The trouble is, I still don't want to have to write a piece called Why I Love Posh Spice, as several newspapers have suggested I do. Any more than I wanted to pen defences of Sarah Ferguson, Christine Hamilton or Paula Yates in their hour of need. </p> <p>Why should I be expected to stand up for a woman who promised to \"obey\" at her wedding and went on to become a parasite par excellence ? Or a woman who wasted a perfectly good brain playing the eternal rock chick between bouts of writing books telling women that, if they didn't stay at home with their children all the time, they'd ruin their lives? Or a Tory cow whose life's work has been standing by her man? These women, whenever I've been unable to avoid them, have caused me nothing but annoyance but, more important, they all strike me as being the type of women who would recoil in horror at the very mention of the word feminism. Why, in the name of God, should I do the sisterly thing? </p> <p>In the past, I always swore that, all things being equal, I would consistently support a woman against a man - or, in the case of these women, the largely male-controlled media. But there comes a point when doing the \"right\" thing doesn't make you good, just stupid - like those American blacks who supported OJ Simpson just because he was \"one of ours\". </p> <p>Talking of which, I see that Mel G - B as was - will soon be B again. Oh dear! Didn't I predict this less than a year ago? Didn't I say that famous women who take their husband's names are actually working overtime at not wearing the trousers, and that any relationship that needs such petty little gestures is doomed from the start? I bet the breast-feeding didn't help, either. Remember how I was so roundly trounced by the Breast-Feeding Police for suggesting that their touting of the two Spice Girl mothers as great role-models for all new young mothers, simply because they had decided to breast-feed, was a little condescending and shallow? And that such a course of action, undertaken without sufficient thought, might put even more of a strain on women and on a relationship that has already had to make many adjustments? Well, Posh and Becks might still be together, but if she hasn't got an eating disorder, I'll eat my own head. Quite frankly, neither Scary nor Posh seem at all improved by the experience; I look forward to an apology from the BFP. </p> <p>As we go into the next century, certain questions must be asked. Such as: what did happen to the 21st-Century Girls? Are they at this very moment ensconced in a secret billet in Maidenhead working on an image revamp, set to spring on us soon in the guise of 22nd-Century Girls? And did I really say that Wannabe was the greatest pop single ever? </p> <p>Probably, though I can't be bothered to go back and check. (My New Year's Resolution: cut down on the research-heavy pieces. Learn to relax and trust own opinion.) However, I did until quite recently believe that mea culpa was a tapas bar, and, having discovered otherwise, I'm ready to pile in there with the self-accusation. I'll have to build up to Marshal Stalin, but I'll start with the Spice Girls. Why did I ever believe the Spice Girls were any good? I would say in my defence that, along with the above-mentioned Awful Women, I probably wouldn't have gone so overboard if the pop papers - the last bastion, along with the gents clubs, of naked, petulant misogyny - hadn't gone after them with such needless fury. I found it particularly sickening that men, who would recoil in horror from racial insults, seemed to have no such scruples about calling Geri \"fat\", \"old\" and \"ginger\". </p> <p>\"If you wanna be my lover/Gotta get with my friends/Make it last forever/Friendship never ends!\" With those four simple lines, more female hearts and souls jumped with joy than at any time since the publication of de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, or at least since Madonna snogged that girl in that video. (As I said, I'm not prepared to labour over any more research-heavy theses, so forget it.) That video - those knowing, loving, sidelong glances, that hand-holding! It was enough to turn you queer, or post-modernist. Like I Should Be So Lucky and Shy Boy before it, Wannabe personified the optimism of the pop feminine, such a vital, usually absent balance to the morbidity of the pop masculine. (Why are there so many pop songs about men killing women, and so few about women killing men? It's not as though we don't have every provocation, and brute strength isn't really a pre-condition when you're just warbling about it. Could it just be because they've got filthy tempers ?) </p> <p> Despite my vow not to demonise men in this century, I would still say that it has mostly been men and marriage that has ruined the Spice Girls. Pairing off and having darling ickle babies made Scary and Posh into two right greedy, grasping cows, selling their weddings to the highest bidder; while hanging out with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and other such relentless masculinists seems to have confused poor Sporty something rotten. Does she really believe that one can be an Antichrist and record duets with Bryan Adams? </p> <p>As for Geri...well, if she sounds like a game 40-year-old divorcee (me) strutting her stuff at Amateur Night now, what's she going to sound like when she is a game 40-year-old divorcee? Dorothy Squires, probably. Marriage hasn't withered and cheapened Geri as it has Scary and Posh, but she does have male trouble of her own: why is George Michael her best friend? Mr Michael is a lovely man, no doubt, a veritable Titan in his chosen profession, but he's only human. And how many homosexual men of a certain theatrical type would have given their capped teeth to have had a ringside seat at the downfall of Judy Garland? Being bezzies with Geri, he's living the dream. </p> <p>Which leaves us with Baby. Amazingly, only Baby - apparently the naffest of them all - leaves us with any hope for the future, with her habit of doing gorgeous covers with Tin Tin Out and dating black men younger than herself. Let's not forget that Baby's mum is her best friend, and that she herself is a karate black belt! Hmm . . . perhaps we can deconstruct \"Baby\" not as in \"Baby Doll\", but as pre-gender free spirit? \"Baby: God or Demi-Tasse?\" - certainly has a ring to it.

One is the way the current mood of detachment, some say neo-iso lationism, affects the conduct of foreign and defence policy, one area in which the president, as commander-in-chief, always leads. It is now hard to envisage circumstances in which the US would send 500,000 troops half way across the world, as President Bush did during the Gulf crisis in 1990-91.

This trend has been exacerbated by congress's growing propensity to appoint special counsels to probe every aspect of a president's affairs. This phenomenon reached a sort of apogee, or low-point, with Kenneth Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal and Mr Clinton's subsequent impeachment. The paralysing effect, in terms of policy and decision-making, of merciless media scrutiny and relentless opinion polling should not be underestimated.</p> <p>It is no bad thing that the days when John Kennedy could entertain women friends at the White House without fear of exposure have passed; that scams like Iran-contra, executed by Oliver North during the Reagan presidency, are harder to conceal; that presidents are forced to respond to minorities' concerns; that the US is less likely to throw its military weight around; and that domestic consensus-building is now so highly valued by an electorate exasperated by Washington's endless partisan squabbling. The people's message to this year's candidates seems clear. Voters do not want dramatic but empty gestures. They do not want promises that cannot be kept. In Mr Clinton's wake especially, they want a president of good character, who means what he says, who will uphold the nation's interest abroad and speak for its values at home. They want a man who will listen to them but who can take tough decisions. Most of all, they want a man they can trust. It may not sound grand, but the president who can achieve this will be truly powerful.</p>",

This phenomenon reached a sort of apogee, or low-point, with Kenneth Starr's investigation of the Lewinsky scandal and Mr Clinton's subsequent impeachment. The paralysing effect, in terms of policy and decision-making, of merciless media scrutiny and relentless opinion polling should not be underestimated. It is no bad thing that the days when John Kennedy could entertain women friends at the White House without fear of exposure have passed; that scams like Iran-contra, executed by Oliver North during the Reagan presidency, are harder to conceal; that presidents are forced to respond to minorities' concerns; that the US is less likely to throw its military weight around; and that domestic consensus-building is now so highly valued by an electorate exasperated by Washington's endless partisan squabbling. The people's message to this year's candidates seems clear. Voters do not want dramatic but empty gestures. They do not want promises that cannot be kept. In Mr Clinton's wake especially, they want a president of good character, who means what he says, who will uphold the nation's interest abroad and speak for its values at home. They want a man who will listen to them but who can take tough decisions. Most of all, they want a man they can trust. It may not sound grand, but the president who can achieve this will be truly powerful.",

      "body": "<p>There's nothing much worse than itchy feet. But instead of getting stuck in the \"should I stay or go\" dilemma, rejoice in the fact that you care enough about your job and your future to actually question the status quo. </p> <p>Neasa MacErlean, author, says: \"Many people review their lives in the New Year. Questioning what they are doing and how happy they are with that is much better than just staying put.\" </p> <p>However, it's still hard to know when to stay and when to go. Many never stop to think beyond the \"I've been in this job for x time, it's time to move on\" or, \"I'm bored\" to actually think about why they want to leave and where they want to go to. Evidently the danger is the old 'out of the frying pan in to the fire' scenario. </p> <p>A back to basics evaluation of your career wants and needs is then, a good idea. </p> <p>You need to think about what motivates you and what sort of environment you would ideally wish to work in. Think about the skills that you have already acquired and those that you would like to master. </p> <p>This should help you build a picture of your ideal job. From here you can now evaluate how well your current job matches that picture. </p> <p>Dr Peter Hawkins, at the University of Liverpool's Graduates Into Employment Unit, thinks it's all about creating your own opportunities. He says: \"You need to have helicopter mentality. Rising above the clouds allows you to see the bigger picture and spot dead ends. It also gives you the ideal vantage point to swoop down and seize opportunities in your current situation.\" </p> <p>The most important thing is to be positive. Debra Allcock, head of campaigning at the Industrial Society, says: \"Enjoyment of work is 90% attitude and 10% the job.\" </p> <p>If you are positive and enthusiastic then you stand a better chance of growing in your existing job, should you decide to stay. </p> <p>Most bosses are amenable to requests to take on additional responsibilities, learning new skills or secondments.

      "bodyText": "There's nothing much worse than itchy feet. But instead of getting stuck in the \"should I stay or go\" dilemma, rejoice in the fact that you care enough about your job and your future to actually question the status quo. Neasa MacErlean, author, says: \"Many people review their lives in the New Year. Questioning what they are doing and how happy they are with that is much better than just staying put.\" However, it's still hard to know when to stay and when to go. Many never stop to think beyond the \"I've been in this job for x time, it's time to move on\" or, \"I'm bored\" to actually think about why they want to leave and where they want to go to. Evidently the danger is the old 'out of the frying pan in to the fire' scenario. A back to basics evaluation of your career wants and needs is then, a good idea. You need to think about what motivates you and what sort of environment you would ideally wish to work in. Think about the skills that you have already acquired and those that you would like to master. This should help you build a picture of your ideal job. From here you can now evaluate how well your current job matches that picture. Dr Peter Hawkins, at the University of Liverpool's Graduates Into Employment Unit, thinks it's all about creating your own opportunities. He says: \"You need to have helicopter mentality. Rising above the clouds allows you to see the bigger picture and spot dead ends. It also gives you the ideal vantage point to swoop down and seize opportunities in your current situation.\" The most important thing is to be positive. Debra Allcock, head of campaigning at the Industrial Society, says: \"Enjoyment of work is 90% attitude and 10% the job.\" If you are positive and enthusiastic then you stand a better chance of growing in your existing job, should you decide to stay. Most bosses are amenable to requests to take on additional responsibilities, learning new skills or secondments. Employees who make these requests obviously care about their contribution to the company and have taken the time to think about their job rather than just plodding on within their existing role. The basic reasons for wanting to leave a job nearly always resurface though. So make sure that any growth you negotiate within your current job, really does offer new opportunities.

      "body": "<p>You have 16 days left. Unless you return your self-assessment tax form by January 31 the Inland Revenue will hit you with a \u00a3100 penalty plus interest on any unpaid tax. Last year the Revenue earned a neat \u00a374.8m from fining the 748,000 people who failed to meet the deadline - or around one in 12 of the 9m sent the forms. So here are some tips on filling in the return and avoiding throwing money at Hector the tax inspector.</p> <p><b> Filling in the return</b><br></p> <p>Get all your tax records together, such as bank statements, business earnings and expenses. You need documents supporting your income to complete the form, but do not send them in with your tax return. The essentials are your P60, P11D and interest certificates.</p> <p>Don't treat the form as a speed trial. The accompanying Revenue notes are usually clear and helpful. \"Above all, do not try to do the tax return from memory,\" says PricewaterhouseCoopers tax partner John Whiting.</p> <p>Make sure you complete everything. The \u00a3100 penalty will still apply if you beat the deadline but don't fill in all the necessary information. Put in exact figures, although Peter Horsman of accountants Saffrey Champness says: \"If you are uncertain of the figures, one is allowed to put in provisional figures so long as they are stated as provisional and a date is given when actual figures will be supplied.\"</p> <p>Many benefits are taxable, with child benefit the key one that is not. If you are unsure, look at the Revenue's notes on the area.</p> <p>Don't forget about pension income, including the state pension. \"Apart from such awards as pensions for winning the Victoria Cross, pensions are taxable, even the state pension,\" warns Mr Whiting.</p> <p>For dividends and interest, you need to put the net amount (cash actually received), the tax deducted (see the certificate/voucher) and the gross amount. Make sure they add up and that you put the amounts in the right boxes.</p> <p>You have to send in your tax payable along with the tax return. As you have missed the September 30 deadline last year, you cannot elect to have the money deducted at source from your pay through Pay As You Earn.</p> <p>Do not forget to sign the return. \"It has been a common cause of rejection!\" says Mr Whiting. Also take a copy of your return, and use last year's return to review against this year's. \"For example, if rental income has dropped dramatically, explain why in the white space to save an obvious question later from the taxman,\" says Mr Whiting.</p> <p><b> Rejection reasons </b><br></p> <p>A tick has been entered in one of the questions 1 to 9 on page 2 of the return but the supplementary page has not been forwarded with the income tax return.</p> <p>Failure to provide details for a 24-month period where the self-employed activity commenced before 6 April 1994.</p> <p>Failure to fully complete the self-employed pages particularly after boxes 3.70/3.75.</p> <p>Detailing information on separate schedules instead of including it on the self assessment income tax return.</p> <p>Entering manuscript notes on the return eg \"per P60\" and/or \"information to follow\" instead of entering actual figures on the form.</p> <p>Failure to sign and date the return.</p> <p><b> Common queries</b><br></p> <p><b>Do I have to pay more tax under Self-assessment?</b></p> <p>Definitely not, says the Revenue. Self-assessment is \"not a new tax and does not affect the amount of tax you need to pay\" it says. But in reality the government has benefited substantially from self-assessment, as people have come clean on the tax they owe rather than sign a false declaration.</p> <p><b> Must I employ an accountant?</b></p> <p>It's entirely up to you. The majority of self-employed people already use accountants. \"If you didn't use an accountant under the old system, you're unlikely to need one for self-assessment,\" says the Revenue.</p> <p><b> Should I send in accounts with the tax return?</b></p> <p>No. The Revenue says: \"It is our view that accounts are unlikely to provide us with additional information unless your business is particularly large or complex. For this reason we only ask for accounts and computations for partnerships whose turnover is \u00a315m or more.\"</p> <p><b> Do you want my P60 or a copy of my form P11D/P9D?</b></p> <p>No. Just put the details on the tax return, but keep the documents in case there are any queries about your return.</p> <p><b> What do I do if there's information I think you need but I can't find the box?</b></p> <p>The Revenue believes its form and notes should give sufficient guidance. But it says: \"You can send in additional information if you consider that it is relevant to your tax liability, and it cannot be entered in the spaces and boxes provided in the return. We will accept any additional information sent in with the return, but recommend that you provide an explanation of why you think its relevant.\"</p> <p><b> What do I do if I disagree with my employer or bank about the figures?</b></p> <p>The Revenue states firmly that you are responsible for the accuracy of your return. \"If you disagree with the information provided by your employer or bank, you should include the information which you think is correct. You should not delay in sending your return,\" it says.</p> <p><b> Is there an electronic version of the tax return?</b></p> <p>Yes, but it only includes the standard eight-page return and supplementary pages for employment. The electronic version of the tax return can be downloaded at <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk.  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk.</a></p> <p><b> What can I expect after I've sent in the return?</b></p> <p>Not much. You will only know that the Revenue has processed your return when you receive your statement of account, showing the tax due based on the figures you have declared. However, the Revenue will contact you if it has had to correct your return.</p> <p><b>How will I know if you are going to make an inquiry into my return?</b></p> <p>If they are going to probe your return, they will write to you no later than January 31, 2001. If you've heard nothing by then, your return is deemed \"final,\" unless they later discover that you lied.</p> <p><b> What if I realise I've made a mistake after I've sent the return in?</b></p> <p>You have one year from the annual filing date (31 January) to make any changes.</p> <p><b>What happens if I miss the deadline by just one day?</b></p> <p>The final deadline, January 31, falls on a Monday. But the Revenue says that no late filing penalty will be charged where the return is either (a) received in the post at any time on Tuesday February 1, or (b) delivered by hand at any time on Tuesday February 1 or (c) found in the tax office letter box by 7.30am on Wednesday February 2.</p> <p><b> Getting help</b><br></p> <p>The best way to obtain last-minute assistance on filling in the form is to ring the Inland Revenue itself. The self-assessment helpline on 0645-000-444 is open evenings and weekends, with calls charged at local rates.

      "bodyText": "You have 16 days left. Unless you return your self-assessment tax form by January 31 the Inland Revenue will hit you with a \u00a3100 penalty plus interest on any unpaid tax. Last year the Revenue earned a neat \u00a374.8m from fining the 748,000 people who failed to meet the deadline - or around one in 12 of the 9m sent the forms. So here are some tips on filling in the return and avoiding throwing money at Hector the tax inspector. Filling in the return Get all your tax records together, such as bank statements, business earnings and expenses. You need documents supporting your income to complete the form, but do not send them in with your tax return. The essentials are your P60, P11D and interest certificates. Don't treat the form as a speed trial. The accompanying Revenue notes are usually clear and helpful. \"Above all, do not try to do the tax return from memory,\" says PricewaterhouseCoopers tax partner John Whiting. Make sure you complete everything. The \u00a3100 penalty will still apply if you beat the deadline but don't fill in all the necessary information. Put in exact figures, although Peter Horsman of accountants Saffrey Champness says: \"If you are uncertain of the figures, one is allowed to put in provisional figures so long as they are stated as provisional and a date is given when actual figures will be supplied.\" Many benefits are taxable, with child benefit the key one that is not. If you are unsure, look at the Revenue's notes on the area. Don't forget about pension income, including the state pension. \"Apart from such awards as pensions for winning the Victoria Cross, pensions are taxable, even the state pension,\" warns Mr Whiting. For dividends and interest, you need to put the net amount (cash actually received), the tax deducted (see the certificate/voucher) and the gross amount. Make sure they add up and that you put the amounts in the right boxes. You have to send in your tax payable along with the tax return. As you have missed the September 30 deadline last year, you cannot elect to have the money deducted at source from your pay through Pay As You Earn. Do not forget to sign the return. \"It has been a common cause of rejection!\" says Mr Whiting. Also take a copy of your return, and use last year's return to review against this year's. \"For example, if rental income has dropped dramatically, explain why in the white space to save an obvious question later from the taxman,\" says Mr Whiting. Rejection reasons A tick has been entered in one of the questions 1 to 9 on page 2 of the return but the supplementary page has not been forwarded with the income tax return. Failure to provide details for a 24-month period where the self-employed activity commenced before 6 April 1994. Failure to fully complete the self-employed pages particularly after boxes 3.70/3.75. Detailing information on separate schedules instead of including it on the self assessment income tax return. Entering manuscript notes on the return eg \"per P60\" and/or \"information to follow\" instead of entering actual figures on the form. Failure to sign and date the return. Common queries Do I have to pay more tax under Self-assessment? Definitely not, says the Revenue. Self-assessment is \"not a new tax and does not affect the amount of tax you need to pay\" it says. But in reality the government has benefited substantially from self-assessment, as people have come clean on the tax they owe rather than sign a false declaration. Must I employ an accountant? It's entirely up to you. The majority of self-employed people already use accountants. \"If you didn't use an accountant under the old system, you're unlikely to need one for self-assessment,\" says the Revenue. Should I send in accounts with the tax return? No. The Revenue says: \"It is our view that accounts are unlikely to provide us with additional information unless your business is particularly large or complex. For this reason we only ask for accounts and computations for partnerships whose turnover is \u00a315m or more.\" Do you want my P60 or a copy of my form P11D/P9D? No. Just put the details on the tax return, but keep the documents in case there are any queries about your return. What do I do if there's information I think you need but I can't find the box? The Revenue believes its form and notes should give sufficient guidance. But it says: \"You can send in additional information if you consider that it is relevant to your tax liability, and it cannot be entered in the spaces and boxes provided in the return. We will accept any additional information sent in with the return, but recommend that you provide an explanation of why you think its relevant.\" What do I do if I disagree with my employer or bank about the figures? The Revenue states firmly that you are responsible for the accuracy of your return. \"If you disagree with the information provided by your employer or bank, you should include the information which you think is correct. You should not delay in sending your return,\" it says. Is there an electronic version of the tax return? Yes, but it only includes the standard eight-page return and supplementary pages for employment. The electronic version of the tax return can be downloaded at www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk. What can I expect after I've sent in the return? Not much. You will only know that the Revenue has processed your return when you receive your statement of account, showing the tax due based on the figures you have declared. However, the Revenue will contact you if it has had to correct your return. How will I know if you are going to make an inquiry into my return? If they are going to probe your return, they will write to you no later than January 31, 2001. If you've heard nothing by then, your return is deemed \"final,\" unless they later discover that you lied. What if I realise I've made a mistake after I've sent the return in? You have one year from the annual filing date (31 January) to make any changes. What happens if I miss the deadline by just one day? The final deadline, January 31, falls on a Monday. But the Revenue says that no late filing penalty will be charged where the return is either (a) received in the post at any time on Tuesday February 1, or (b) delivered by hand at any time on Tuesday February 1 or (c) found in the tax office letter box by 7.30am on Wednesday February 2. Getting help The best way to obtain last-minute assistance on filling in the form is to ring the Inland Revenue itself. The self-assessment helpline on 0645-000-444 is open evenings and weekends, with calls charged at local rates. You can also ring local Tax Enquiry Centres, listed in the telephone book under Inland Revenue. Most tax offices are open to the public from 8.30am to 4.30pm Monday to Friday. You can also call the Revenue's Orderline on 0645-000-404 for explanatory leaflets and booklets. In addition the Inland Revenue operates an extremely comprehensive and easy to use website containing most of the information in its booklets on www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk. Lots of accountancy firms have also begun offering their services over the internet, and some say that they will still be able to complete your form and get it to the Revenue by the deadline. Fees are either on a fixed basis for simple returns, starting at around \u00a350, rising to \u00a3150-\u00a3200 for more complex returns for the self-employed.

Do they go for a loan based on what we think will happen in the short term, or do they make their decision based on what the experts are predicting will happen later? \"A short-term rate rise, followed by a [predicted] fall, is a tricky one for borrowers to call,\" says Ray Boulger at mortgage brokers John Charcol.</p> <p>Despite the medium- to long-term predictions of rate cuts, some housebuyers, particularly those with tight budgets, will probably still prefer the certainty of a fixed-rate deal, he adds.

Lowest fixed rates include Skipton building society, which is offering those able to stump up a deposit of 20%-plus a loan fixed at 5.45% until March 1 2002 (but you must take their buildings and contents insurance, and there is an early redemption penalty of 3% throughout the fixed period).</p> <p>NatWest has a deal fixed at 5.99% until March 1 2002 which has no redemption penalties and is available to those who can only manage a 5% deposit and Britannia building society, has a mortgage fixed at 6.15% for three years (but the loan is only available to borrowers with a deposit of 25%-plus of the property's value and there are redemption penalties).</p> <p>Tracker mortgages have been popular for some time. But some borrowers will be worried about going for one at a time when rates are rising. In response John Charcol is offering a combined tracker/capped mortgage, where what you pay is set at bank base rate plus 0.95% for the life of the loan, resulting in a current payment rate of 6.7%. The rate is capped at 6.99% for five years, so you won't pay any more than that during that period.</p> <p>And if rates fall, of course, so does what you pay. It's available for house purchases and remortgages up to 90% of the property's value (95% for first-time buyers), but there is a redemption penalty of 180 days' interest during the capped rate period.</p> <p>Perhaps the best deal on the discounted rate front is offered by the Halifax. It gives borrowers 2.25% off its standard variable mortgage rate until January 31 2002. It's available for loans of up to 95% of the property's value and there are no redemption penalties and no fee to pay.</p> <p>Thursday's rate rise was the third in five months. A quarter point rise on a Halifax \u00a360,000 repayment mortgage would mean a \u00a39.18 increase in monthly payments from \u00a3420.26 to \u00a3429.44.</p> <p>Ray Boulger anticipates another 0.25% base rate rise next month or in March, with rates starting to fall come 2001. Economists at HSBC say a further hike at February's meeting \"appears likely,\" with base rates expected to peak at 6.5% by the end of June.</p> <p>Moneyfacts says the typical mortgage rate currently stands at 7.17%, while the typical instant-access savings rate is just 1.21% net. Five years ago the differential was much narrower - the mortgage rate figure was only slightly higher at 8.11% but the typical saver was getting 3.06%, some two-and-a-half times what they are getting now.</p> <p>Many commentators said the rate rise, though unpleasant for homeowners, will help to ensure that housing \"hot spots\" are kept in check. A survey this week from Nationwide building society revealed that these hot spots include the London boroughs of Hackney, Merton and Wandsworth, and Brighton. All four saw house prices shoot up 36%-37% last year. Close behind were Southwark and the East Sussex town of Hastings (both 34%).</p>",

The rate is capped at 6.99% for five years, so you won't pay any more than that during that period. And if rates fall, of course, so does what you pay. It's available for house purchases and remortgages up to 90% of the property's value (95% for first-time buyers), but there is a redemption penalty of 180 days' interest during the capped rate period. Perhaps the best deal on the discounted rate front is offered by the Halifax. It gives borrowers 2.25% off its standard variable mortgage rate until January 31 2002. It's available for loans of up to 95% of the property's value and there are no redemption penalties and no fee to pay. Thursday's rate rise was the third in five months. A quarter point rise on a Halifax \u00a360,000 repayment mortgage would mean a \u00a39.18 increase in monthly payments from \u00a3420.26 to \u00a3429.44. Ray Boulger anticipates another 0.25% base rate rise next month or in March, with rates starting to fall come 2001. Economists at HSBC say a further hike at February's meeting \"appears likely,\" with base rates expected to peak at 6.5% by the end of June. Moneyfacts says the typical mortgage rate currently stands at 7.17%, while the typical instant-access savings rate is just 1.21% net. Five years ago the differential was much narrower - the mortgage rate figure was only slightly higher at 8.11% but the typical saver was getting 3.06%, some two-and-a-half times what they are getting now. Many commentators said the rate rise, though unpleasant for homeowners, will help to ensure that housing \"hot spots\" are kept in check. A survey this week from Nationwide building society revealed that these hot spots include the London boroughs of Hackney, Merton and Wandsworth, and Brighton. All four saw house prices shoot up 36%-37% last year. Close behind were Southwark and the East Sussex town of Hastings (both 34%).",

With a \u00a350,000 mortgage monthly repayments might be \u00a3285 before insurance, leaving \u00a3145 to save or spend. Mr Goff says as long as the property costs less than \u00a3100,000 there is a fair chance of generating a decent capital sum which could be used to pay off debts.</p> <p>Another way to avoid the rent problem is to persuade your parents to take out a buy-to-let mortgage and buy a property for you. Buyers need to put up at least 15% of the purchase price. Ray Boulger, technical director of John Charcol, the UK's largest mortgage broker, says it is best to have all the students in the house as co-signatories on the same tenancy agreement. This puts the onus on the residents to find a replacement for anyone who moves out since they are jointly responsible for the total rent payment.</p> <p>One danger is that some mortgage lenders prefer properties not to be used for investment purposes. So if you do plan to earn extra from the property check the terms of the loan with the product provider first.</p>",

With a \u00a350,000 mortgage monthly repayments might be \u00a3285 before insurance, leaving \u00a3145 to save or spend. Mr Goff says as long as the property costs less than \u00a3100,000 there is a fair chance of generating a decent capital sum which could be used to pay off debts. Another way to avoid the rent problem is to persuade your parents to take out a buy-to-let mortgage and buy a property for you. Buyers need to put up at least 15% of the purchase price. Ray Boulger, technical director of John Charcol, the UK's largest mortgage broker, says it is best to have all the students in the house as co-signatories on the same tenancy agreement. This puts the onus on the residents to find a replacement for anyone who moves out since they are jointly responsible for the total rent payment. One danger is that some mortgage lenders prefer properties not to be used for investment purposes. So if you do plan to earn extra from the property check the terms of the loan with the product provider first.",

Now he's no longer managing the fund (for three months at least), what should investors do?</p> <p>Not only Jupiter investors are worried. Last week Scott McGlashan, Perpetual's Japan guru and the well-regarded manager of its AA-rated \u00a3183m Far Eastern Growth unit trust and \u00a323m Japanese investment trust, announced his resignation. And Hugh Everitt, manager of the \u00a31.4bn CGU's AA-rated PPT Monthly Income Plus fund resigned this week.</p> <p>Andrew Callender, another well respected fund manager who was in charge of Invesco Asset Management's Japan funds - the AA-rated \u00a3124.9m Invesco GT Japan Growth and the the \u00a3210.3 million GT Japan investment trust - is to give up his fund management duties and return to the UK from Tokyo in the next six months. Potentially, this leaves more than 670,000 investors to decide whether a change of manager on their fund is sufficient reason to reinvest elsewhere.</p> <p>The answer depends on two factors: the management style of the company and the replacement manager. Since Peter Young embarrassed Morgan Grenfell with the scandal over his management of the apparently successful European Growth in 1996, management companies have been wary of the star fund manager concept.</p> <p>A few companies still allow particular managers some leeway - Jupiter is one example - but most operate a team-structured strategy. In such companies the loss of a manager may not make much difference.</p> <p>At Jupiter Mr Littlewood's day-to-day duties will be taken over by Prakesh Rajasekaran, his assistant on the fund since 1996. He also manages several specialist pension funds including a private unit trust called the Whitehall Growth unit trust.</p> <p>Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \"It should be remembered that the Jupiter Income trust is a flagship fund for the Jupiter group and we therefore feel that Prakash must be viewed extremely highly within the group to be allowed the day-to-day responsibilities of running what for Jupiter is their most important fund.\"</p> <p>Will Mr Dampier continue recommending the fund? Until he has a chance to meet the new manager face to face, he will reserve judgment about what to do with clients' money. \"As with most changes, be they temporary or permanent, we do like to take time to evaluate the situation before rushing to make any decisions. Our own view at the present is that investors should not panic out.\"</p> <p>Jason Hollands, at independent financial advisers Best Investment, says: \"Our view is to hold on to existing units but not to place new monies into the fund until Mr Littlewood's sabbatical period comes to an end.</p> <p>\"We did meet Mr Littlewood in December and he did indeed look 'exhausted'. The pressures of running such a large trust in a market which places so much emphasis on short-term performance are huge and the last quarter was William Littlewood's worst ever.\"</p> <p>In the 10 years to January 10 the Jupiter Income has grown by 389% compared with only 191% for the UK equity income sector average. But in the last six months Mr Littlewood has slipped, with the fund dropping by 8.4% against an average fall in the sector of only 3.8%.</p> <p>\"The real question is whether or not the three month sabbatical ends up in a fundamental rethink on his career. He is rumoured to have exercised anything up to \u00a320m in his share options which matured in December. Clearly the guy may decide he wants - and can afford to - do something different,\" says Mr Hollands.</p> <p>Little is known about Akira Hiramine, Mr Callender's replacement who joins Invesco from Daiichi Life in Tokyo. But as a new arrival to the company he may lack the familiarity with its style and funds that might reassure investors whose money is now in the hands of Mr Rajasekaran at Jupiter.</p> <p>Mr McGlashan's replacement, Paul Chesson, has a similar advantage as an existing member of the Japanese team. He has been at Perpetual for seven years.</p> <p>Mr Everitt's replacement at CGU is Mark Gull, who has been there for about a year. Before this he managed the Gartmore Corporate Bond fund.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The manager of one of the UK's most popular investment funds, the \u00a31.5bn Jupiter Income, shocked investors and City-watchers by announcing this week that he is to step aside from the day-to-day management because of exhaustion. Many financial advisers have encouraged small investors to buy the Jupiter Income fund largely because of the skills of William Littlewood. Now he's no longer managing the fund (for three months at least), what should investors do? Not only Jupiter investors are worried. Last week Scott McGlashan, Perpetual's Japan guru and the well-regarded manager of its AA-rated \u00a3183m Far Eastern Growth unit trust and \u00a323m Japanese investment trust, announced his resignation. And Hugh Everitt, manager of the \u00a31.4bn CGU's AA-rated PPT Monthly Income Plus fund resigned this week. Andrew Callender, another well respected fund manager who was in charge of Invesco Asset Management's Japan funds - the AA-rated \u00a3124.9m Invesco GT Japan Growth and the the \u00a3210.3 million GT Japan investment trust - is to give up his fund management duties and return to the UK from Tokyo in the next six months. Potentially, this leaves more than 670,000 investors to decide whether a change of manager on their fund is sufficient reason to reinvest elsewhere. The answer depends on two factors: the management style of the company and the replacement manager. Since Peter Young embarrassed Morgan Grenfell with the scandal over his management of the apparently successful European Growth in 1996, management companies have been wary of the star fund manager concept. A few companies still allow particular managers some leeway - Jupiter is one example - but most operate a team-structured strategy. In such companies the loss of a manager may not make much difference. At Jupiter Mr Littlewood's day-to-day duties will be taken over by Prakesh Rajasekaran, his assistant on the fund since 1996. He also manages several specialist pension funds including a private unit trust called the Whitehall Growth unit trust. Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: \"It should be remembered that the Jupiter Income trust is a flagship fund for the Jupiter group and we therefore feel that Prakash must be viewed extremely highly within the group to be allowed the day-to-day responsibilities of running what for Jupiter is their most important fund.\" Will Mr Dampier continue recommending the fund? Until he has a chance to meet the new manager face to face, he will reserve judgment about what to do with clients' money. \"As with most changes, be they temporary or permanent, we do like to take time to evaluate the situation before rushing to make any decisions. Our own view at the present is that investors should not panic out.\" Jason Hollands, at independent financial advisers Best Investment, says: \"Our view is to hold on to existing units but not to place new monies into the fund until Mr Littlewood's sabbatical period comes to an end. \"We did meet Mr Littlewood in December and he did indeed look 'exhausted'. The pressures of running such a large trust in a market which places so much emphasis on short-term performance are huge and the last quarter was William Littlewood's worst ever.\" In the 10 years to January 10 the Jupiter Income has grown by 389% compared with only 191% for the UK equity income sector average. But in the last six months Mr Littlewood has slipped, with the fund dropping by 8.4% against an average fall in the sector of only 3.8%. \"The real question is whether or not the three month sabbatical ends up in a fundamental rethink on his career. He is rumoured to have exercised anything up to \u00a320m in his share options which matured in December. Clearly the guy may decide he wants - and can afford to - do something different,\" says Mr Hollands. Little is known about Akira Hiramine, Mr Callender's replacement who joins Invesco from Daiichi Life in Tokyo. But as a new arrival to the company he may lack the familiarity with its style and funds that might reassure investors whose money is now in the hands of Mr Rajasekaran at Jupiter. Mr McGlashan's replacement, Paul Chesson, has a similar advantage as an existing member of the Japanese team. He has been at Perpetual for seven years. Mr Everitt's replacement at CGU is Mark Gull, who has been there for about a year. Before this he managed the Gartmore Corporate Bond fund.",

      "body": "<p>Last summer, out of a longing I could not express even to myself, I took the family off to Granada, in Spain. I spent long days in the Alhambra, the famous palace overlooking the city that was conquered and ruled with legendary civility by the Moors from 1238 to 1492. Surrounded by exquisitely carved panels, inscriptions, tiles and paintings, I felt deeply restored as I watched my daughter, Leila, playing with the water in the fountains. For us Muslims who are now in the west, though not yet of it, this place offers historical entitlement to call ourselves European (in the face of a white fortress mentality) and tells us that Muslims did not always lead joyless lives thwarted by anger, protest and sterile rules. Apostates appear to draw comfort from this, too. Just read Tariq Ali's Shadows Of The Pomegranate Tree and Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh. On such journeys to a different time and place, we remind ourselves that we were once known for our great art and invention, poetry and elegance.</p> <p>This must be why young British Muslims are flocking to Granada. You see them with their grey hijabs and tight, often self-righteous faces, which visibly flower as they walk around. The record of miserable leadership in our own communities and aggressive western hegemony are jointly responsible for this sense of failure that so many of the one-and-a-half million British Muslims feel today. Even here in Granada, the standard tourist guide (published in 1993) informs us that the Christians had \"artistic sense\" compared with the Moors, who were only capable of \"caprice\".</p> <p>Navid Akhtar, a young British-trained architect and television producer, recalls how his tutors at a London college, who knew nothing about the global importance of Islamic aesthetics, assumed that people such as him were \"uncultured\". \"You hit a brick wall. Architecture and design are white, middle-class professions, I was told not to design a mosque because there was nobody there who could judge it.\" His own people could do little to redress the balance: \"They have no notion of kitsch. People, when they moved here, became disconnected from their living arts. Life was hard. They had little time or money left over. The irony is that young people like myself saw the carpets and various antique objects made by Muslims and saw them belonging to white purveyors at Liberty's. Not for us.\"</p> <p>Muslims rank among the poorest people in Britain today; for years they have had to keep a low profile for fear of racial attack, praying in unmarked shops and warehouses, struggling to survive. It is understandable that escapist Bollywood films rather than high art give them respite. But those Muslims who are rich or powerful show, if anything, even greater indifference to the arts.</p> <p>One of our most successful painters is Libyan-born Ali Omar Ermes, who recently presented to Tony Blair one of his powerfully poetic paintings (which now fetch a fortune, though you wouldn't know this from the modesty of the man and his house in Acton, west London). The work I love best of Ermes is a triptych, with three words painted in dramatic black and red. They are \"No\", \"Yes\" and \"But\" in Arabic. It is a commentary on the chicanery of leaders. He finds the philistinism among fellow Muslims utterly depressing. \"Instead of being producers of beauty, we have become consumers of cheap western replicas. We don't look for inspiration within our own legacy. Instead, we buy mock regency furniture and hang tasteless pictures on the walls.\"</p> <p>Almost suddenly, however, this is all beginning to change. Creative Muslims are striking out. The young Londoner Vaseem Mohammed started off selling his intriguing paintings - which are indisputably Islamic yet executed in a ruthlessly modern style - in Spitalfields market. Now, he has a wide range of admirers. Saleem Arif, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, has won accolades from people such as Sarah Wilson of the Courtauld Institute. He rejects the confines of the square or rectangle and makes his pictures as interlocking shapes on the wall. Every breath he takes, says Wilson, comes from his faith and this is what makes his pictures unique. Women artists are emerging. Zarina Bhimji, whose pieces have been bought by the V&amp;A, creates disturbing, highly-charged, defiant images using unlikely materials such as pubic hair. Erstwhile biologist Soni Zuberi-Shah has set up her own gallery, featuring artists such as Sundus Omar Ali, a British-Iraqi printmaker, and Shaheen Ahmed, whose multi-media work includes computer-generated images.</p> <p>Then there are the architects who are rehabilitating Islamic design. The new King Fahad mosque in Edinburgh uses Scottish stone and slate and has been designed to represent both modern-day Islam and an independent Scottish nation. The Guardian's Jonathan Glancey (who is usually impatient with transplanted onion domes) says this simple, geometric building is not only strikingly beautiful but it gives out the message that it is at home.</p> <p>The playwright and actor Ayub Khan-Din (who is mixed race and wary about being described as a Muslim artist because of all the unwelcome expectations this then imposes on creative life) is now regarded as one of theatre's most exciting new talents. His East Is East, which has recently been made into a highly-praised film, did brilliantly well at London's Royal Court last year. It is a funny, perceptive portrayal of a northern, working-class family in the 60s, where a white woman is married to a Muslim man: he is in conflict with his children who are impatient with traditional ways, such as arranged marriage, yet uncertain of their own identity. The play drew in new audiences; white people who had never been inside Muslim family life, and Muslims who had never before stepped inside a theatre.</p> <p>Ahdaf Soueif, the Egyptian novelist who writes in English, was shortlisted for last year's Booker Prize for an ambitious and gripping novel - her fourth - A Map Of Love. It is a moving exploration of love between Byronic Arab men and western women a century apart, in a world where nothing can ever be simply personal and where politics is the third person in the bed. Her books kick aside the abiding images of an ancient and romantic Egypt portrayed in Hollywood films. Her Egypt struggles with liberation and modernity. Her characters are chaotic, sophisticated, and full of irrepressible desires and sensuality.</p> <p>Razia, an art student in London who makes fabulous blue pots, believes these are the first shoots of a renaissance. \"I did not know the word for what is happening until I went to art school. I think we Muslims have been in a terrible mini dark age, which got even darker when that damned book was burnt in Bradford. Now we are coming through. And I think that, just like the western renaissance period, some of us are churning out fantastic devotional work, while others are questioning what we have been brought up to believe. We have been burning with shame, and so many of us are using art to make some sense of what has happened to us.\"</p> <p>It is not that simple. You cannot invent art out of circumstance, any more than you can invent love. Yet something is definitely in the air. Various national events exploring the theme of British Muslim art have been organised. The British Council, the Arts Council, the V&amp;A and a host of other reputable institutions have made it their business to encourage the process. Prince Charles has embraced the development with the enthusiasm of a convert, perhaps because it provides some succour in the midst of the postmodern jungle he clearly finds trying. The Prince's Institute of Architecture supports Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts (VITA), in which graduate students from around the world produce work grounded in Islamic aesthetics. Professor Keith Critchlow, who runs the institute and is the author of Islamic Patterns: A Cosmological Approach, believes that geometric forms, patterns and colours as manifested in Islamic art embody \"the beauty of the permanent which shines through the world of the transient\" and represent something of \"a more profound order\".</p> <p>Many of the new Muslim artists I met reflect upon this profundity. Narcissism and hedonism are not part of the world they inhabit. They feel a fervent desire to change and challenge and to create a different discourse. I sat for hours on embroidered cushions in various homes, drinking thick sweet coffee (sometimes illicit wine) and hot samosas, and listening to writers, painters, designers and publishers locked in intellectual debate. How does a diasporic artist relate to the home country? Who says \"bloody, stuffed sheep and stinking piss on canvas\" is art? Why did western art move so carelessly from the soul to the senses? What constitutes true and honourable art (alien concepts for those who think that art is one long masturbatory act of self indulgence - although remember that it was Norman Mailer who said that the final purpose of art is to intensify, even exacerbate moral consciousness)? How can artists save the world from environmental destruction and globalisation? Is figurative art blasphemy? How did that hiatus between past glories and present sterility come to be? And why has the history and tradition of Muslim art been lost to memory?</p> <p>Culturally, British Islam and Christian Britain have been inextricably linked, and this is something barely understood by either side. That history is not simply one of mutual and continuous hatred dating back to the Crusades. A fascinating new book, Islam In Britain: 1558-1685, by Nabil Mater, claims that through the Renaissance and beyond \"Muslims and their Arab-Islamic legacy were part of the religious, commercial and military self-definition of England\". In drama and theology, in churches and in fashionable coffee houses (coffee was brought from Turkey and called the Mahometan berry), among merchants, weavers, writers and painters, Islam was ever present and exerted a subliminal influence. It was the fear and fascination epitomised by Othello. The frescoes in the House of Commons and many Mogul miniature paintings reflect the mutual respect felt by two civilisations when they first encountered each other. White collectors loved so much of what they saw in Muslim countries, they took vast amounts of it. The British Library, the V&amp;A and the British Museum between them hold the greatest collections of Islamic manuscripts and paintings in the world.</p> <p>To marvel at Islamic art and design you have only to go to Leighton House in London's Holland Park, where entire rooms are packed out with such loveliness it makes me cry. From Brighton Pavilion to William Morris prints, Islam has inspired those who were supposed to hate it. We are forever grappling with such contradictions. There is what one commentator, William Dalrymple, has called \"a peculiarly British strain of headbanging hostility to Muslims\", yet well-heeled aficionados still flock to sales at Christie's to buy that gold-plated Koran, medieval Persian vase or 15th-century Mamluk brass lamp. Always present, too, is the \"Orientalism\" that Edward Said writes about, by which he means a kind of historical and artistic dread of the east, for its supposed barbarism, violence and lack of culture.</p> <p>Rana Kabbani, in her book, Imperial Fictions, shows how Europeans portrayed Muslims negatively in order to justify their colonial ambitions. Popular painters such as Edwin Long (The Babylonian Slave, 1875), John Faed (Bedouin exchanging a slave for armour, 1857), even Ingres (Le Bain Turc, 1862) did much to promote the idea of the Islamic east as dangerous, lewd and irrational. But bigotry is never the whole story. For their part, the present crop of Muslim artists reject simplistic ideas about the east and west and are also questioning what seems to them a senseless disengagement with anything western. Wijdaan Ali, author of the priceless Modern Islamic Art, shows how a productive exchange - unmarred by prejudice - became possible, and how western aesthetics and art stimulated many Muslim artists.</p> <p>Canvas and paint came into their lives for a start. Egypt opened a school of modern art in 1908, and influential Arab artists publicly condemned the Nazi demonisation of Bauhaus painters such as Paul Klee. Surrealism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism were embraced. Beirut, Baghdad, Tehran and Amman flourished as centres of artistic excellence. Look at the brilliant paintings (Mother and Child, for example) of the Algerian painter, Mohammed Issiakhem, and you can see just how fecund this relationship between the colonised and the colonisers had become in spite of the great inequality between them.</p> <p>But it could not last. The architect Ayub Malik thinks this cross-fertilisation led to \"art in drag\", which was pretending an authenticity it had given away the day it dislocated from a living artistic tradition to become an accessory to the west. \"Art sitting on its bottom in a gallery, painted with paints that no ordinary Muslims would ever be able to afford. Do you call this Islamic art?\" Many artists came to understand that they could never be wholly western or carelessly hybrid. Some felt they had amputated their roots and resented the implications that they were forever in the process of catching up. A void was created that affected British Muslims, too.</p> <p>The oil crisis in the 70s created unimaginable wealth for some Muslims, and new stereotypes emerged of rich, fat Arabs in sunglasses. This deeply affected Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the dashing Saudi spokesperson, who refused to defer to those who thought they owned the world, and so the oil in his country. He set up the Al Furqan Islamic Heritage Centre in south London, which has become an important collection point for Muslim manuscripts, thinkers and critics. Their current project is to salvage the precious ancient Islamic manuscripts, many of which were deliberately damaged by Serb soldiers in Bosnia. The director of the centre is the novelist Ahdaf Soueif herself.</p> <p>The Islamic Arts Foundation was set up in 1981 for similar reasons. It publishes the glossy periodical Arts And The Islamic World. It is not simply about the past, says Jalal Uddin Ahmed, a man steeped in knowledge and a lust for beauty: \"British Muslims cannot ever abscond from their heritage or hide in it. You must transform the past, but you must know it first. And this is happening. Dr Ahmed Moustapha is the world's greatest calligrapher, whose work is in the Vatican. He lives here now. His creations meet a need for a new identity among our young who are still seeking their place. From his great work they learn that, to influence mainstream society, you have to deserve it. Understand, deserve before you desire, that is what I tell those who are searching for that new identity.\"</p> <p>What is fascinating is how this search for an identity is leading to three distinct artistic responses. You have the reclaimers, the rebels, and the people who are trying to make new artistic settlements with their adoptive country.</p> <p>The reclaimers would include Ermes. For him, art is an act of worship. Unfortunately, these days you are as likely to find his pictures in the lobbies of Malaysian hotels as in the British Museum. Of the three Abrahamic faiths, only Christians have broken the holy injunction not to create the image of God or the prophets. And, although others disagree, Ermes believes that any figurative painting is just as wrong: \"We are not in the business of worshipping icons. How can this gift be wasted by painting the face of a queen? We must discover new shapes, new modes of reflecting the spiritual. Why replicate nature which God has made?\"</p> <p>I personally love the idea of art for God's sake. There is something so looming and overwhelming about these artists. At VITA, Claire Cooke, who embroiders shawls (yes it is art, not merely craft) says, \"The sacred has gone out of our society. This is transcendental art. It has a deeper meaning.\" Martin Moller, the Danish glass blower, is transformed by a new sense of spirituality. David Fuerestien, an Anglo-Swiss traditional artist - in the sense that his art is devotional, though modern in style - believes that there is too much ego in modern western art and that \"there is an emptiness. This art - my tiles, my fountain - is bigger than me or you. The complexity of sacred geometry puts you in your place in the universe.\"</p> <p>Others grapple with these bigger questions on a smaller scale. Fatima Zahrah Hassan paints miniatures in the Mogul style, but in order to personify the music she loves or the things she believes in. Her pictures are delicate and unexpectedly insolent, especially if you look at the faces of the women. But they are still part of a lost-and-found tradition.</p> <p>Then there are the rebels, whose art reflects the anger of always having to explain their position to their own as well as those on the outside. But that discontent itself generates a creativity that is edgy, interesting and thankfully devoid of complacency. The rebels do not rate the reclaimers. According to architect Ayub Malik, \"Art should be a moving, traumatic experience. British Muslim art is mostly fossilised in the past, the Prince Charles syndrome. It is being made for the sake of filling a space. Some spaces are better left empty. Only people lacking in self esteem look behind to the Taj or make fake gold domes to impress. We are in a state of formativeness and our art needs to reflect that.\" He is driven towards the future, and you can see this in his designs, which use glass mercilessly and then surrender to tradition with a tiny sculpture.</p> <p>It is that struggle of modernity versus memory that moves the novelist and playwright Ruksana Ahmed, too: \"Even if you have a distant relationship with Islam, your life is embattled by the values. There are lines of conduct. I am an individual, feminist, a writer and you do struggle against the forces which would deny you any of these.\" Yet she knows that everything that is authentic to her comes from that memory of a Muslim life lived once in Pakistan. Her play, River Of Fire, which is the Antigone story set in Mogul India, embodies these tensions. You would put Zarina Bhimji's disturbing work in this bracket. Or the provocative paintings of Farzana Adamjee, a small, strong woman with an unapologetic feminist agenda. She paints women all attempting to subvert their allocated spaces in life, letting their spirits out.

      "bodyText": "Last summer, out of a longing I could not express even to myself, I took the family off to Granada, in Spain. I spent long days in the Alhambra, the famous palace overlooking the city that was conquered and ruled with legendary civility by the Moors from 1238 to 1492. Surrounded by exquisitely carved panels, inscriptions, tiles and paintings, I felt deeply restored as I watched my daughter, Leila, playing with the water in the fountains. For us Muslims who are now in the west, though not yet of it, this place offers historical entitlement to call ourselves European (in the face of a white fortress mentality) and tells us that Muslims did not always lead joyless lives thwarted by anger, protest and sterile rules. Apostates appear to draw comfort from this, too. Just read Tariq Ali's Shadows Of The Pomegranate Tree and Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh. On such journeys to a different time and place, we remind ourselves that we were once known for our great art and invention, poetry and elegance. This must be why young British Muslims are flocking to Granada. You see them with their grey hijabs and tight, often self-righteous faces, which visibly flower as they walk around. The record of miserable leadership in our own communities and aggressive western hegemony are jointly responsible for this sense of failure that so many of the one-and-a-half million British Muslims feel today. Even here in Granada, the standard tourist guide (published in 1993) informs us that the Christians had \"artistic sense\" compared with the Moors, who were only capable of \"caprice\". Navid Akhtar, a young British-trained architect and television producer, recalls how his tutors at a London college, who knew nothing about the global importance of Islamic aesthetics, assumed that people such as him were \"uncultured\". \"You hit a brick wall. Architecture and design are white, middle-class professions, I was told not to design a mosque because there was nobody there who could judge it.\" His own people could do little to redress the balance: \"They have no notion of kitsch. People, when they moved here, became disconnected from their living arts. Life was hard. They had little time or money left over. The irony is that young people like myself saw the carpets and various antique objects made by Muslims and saw them belonging to white purveyors at Liberty's. Not for us.\" Muslims rank among the poorest people in Britain today; for years they have had to keep a low profile for fear of racial attack, praying in unmarked shops and warehouses, struggling to survive. It is understandable that escapist Bollywood films rather than high art give them respite. But those Muslims who are rich or powerful show, if anything, even greater indifference to the arts. One of our most successful painters is Libyan-born Ali Omar Ermes, who recently presented to Tony Blair one of his powerfully poetic paintings (which now fetch a fortune, though you wouldn't know this from the modesty of the man and his house in Acton, west London). The work I love best of Ermes is a triptych, with three words painted in dramatic black and red. They are \"No\", \"Yes\" and \"But\" in Arabic. It is a commentary on the chicanery of leaders. He finds the philistinism among fellow Muslims utterly depressing. \"Instead of being producers of beauty, we have become consumers of cheap western replicas. We don't look for inspiration within our own legacy. Instead, we buy mock regency furniture and hang tasteless pictures on the walls.\" Almost suddenly, however, this is all beginning to change. Creative Muslims are striking out. The young Londoner Vaseem Mohammed started off selling his intriguing paintings - which are indisputably Islamic yet executed in a ruthlessly modern style - in Spitalfields market. Now, he has a wide range of admirers. Saleem Arif, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, has won accolades from people such as Sarah Wilson of the Courtauld Institute. He rejects the confines of the square or rectangle and makes his pictures as interlocking shapes on the wall. Every breath he takes, says Wilson, comes from his faith and this is what makes his pictures unique. Women artists are emerging. Zarina Bhimji, whose pieces have been bought by the V&amp;A, creates disturbing, highly-charged, defiant images using unlikely materials such as pubic hair. Erstwhile biologist Soni Zuberi-Shah has set up her own gallery, featuring artists such as Sundus Omar Ali, a British-Iraqi printmaker, and Shaheen Ahmed, whose multi-media work includes computer-generated images. Then there are the architects who are rehabilitating Islamic design. The new King Fahad mosque in Edinburgh uses Scottish stone and slate and has been designed to represent both modern-day Islam and an independent Scottish nation. The Guardian's Jonathan Glancey (who is usually impatient with transplanted onion domes) says this simple, geometric building is not only strikingly beautiful but it gives out the message that it is at home. The playwright and actor Ayub Khan-Din (who is mixed race and wary about being described as a Muslim artist because of all the unwelcome expectations this then imposes on creative life) is now regarded as one of theatre's most exciting new talents. His East Is East, which has recently been made into a highly-praised film, did brilliantly well at London's Royal Court last year. It is a funny, perceptive portrayal of a northern, working-class family in the 60s, where a white woman is married to a Muslim man: he is in conflict with his children who are impatient with traditional ways, such as arranged marriage, yet uncertain of their own identity. The play drew in new audiences; white people who had never been inside Muslim family life, and Muslims who had never before stepped inside a theatre. Ahdaf Soueif, the Egyptian novelist who writes in English, was shortlisted for last year's Booker Prize for an ambitious and gripping novel - her fourth - A Map Of Love. It is a moving exploration of love between Byronic Arab men and western women a century apart, in a world where nothing can ever be simply personal and where politics is the third person in the bed. Her books kick aside the abiding images of an ancient and romantic Egypt portrayed in Hollywood films. Her Egypt struggles with liberation and modernity. Her characters are chaotic, sophisticated, and full of irrepressible desires and sensuality. Razia, an art student in London who makes fabulous blue pots, believes these are the first shoots of a renaissance. \"I did not know the word for what is happening until I went to art school. I think we Muslims have been in a terrible mini dark age, which got even darker when that damned book was burnt in Bradford. Now we are coming through. And I think that, just like the western renaissance period, some of us are churning out fantastic devotional work, while others are questioning what we have been brought up to believe. We have been burning with shame, and so many of us are using art to make some sense of what has happened to us.\" It is not that simple. You cannot invent art out of circumstance, any more than you can invent love. Yet something is definitely in the air. Various national events exploring the theme of British Muslim art have been organised. The British Council, the Arts Council, the V&amp;A and a host of other reputable institutions have made it their business to encourage the process. Prince Charles has embraced the development with the enthusiasm of a convert, perhaps because it provides some succour in the midst of the postmodern jungle he clearly finds trying. The Prince's Institute of Architecture supports Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts (VITA), in which graduate students from around the world produce work grounded in Islamic aesthetics. Professor Keith Critchlow, who runs the institute and is the author of Islamic Patterns: A Cosmological Approach, believes that geometric forms, patterns and colours as manifested in Islamic art embody \"the beauty of the permanent which shines through the world of the transient\" and represent something of \"a more profound order\". Many of the new Muslim artists I met reflect upon this profundity. Narcissism and hedonism are not part of the world they inhabit. They feel a fervent desire to change and challenge and to create a different discourse. I sat for hours on embroidered cushions in various homes, drinking thick sweet coffee (sometimes illicit wine) and hot samosas, and listening to writers, painters, designers and publishers locked in intellectual debate. How does a diasporic artist relate to the home country? Who says \"bloody, stuffed sheep and stinking piss on canvas\" is art? Why did western art move so carelessly from the soul to the senses? What constitutes true and honourable art (alien concepts for those who think that art is one long masturbatory act of self indulgence - although remember that it was Norman Mailer who said that the final purpose of art is to intensify, even exacerbate moral consciousness)? How can artists save the world from environmental destruction and globalisation? Is figurative art blasphemy? How did that hiatus between past glories and present sterility come to be? And why has the history and tradition of Muslim art been lost to memory? Culturally, British Islam and Christian Britain have been inextricably linked, and this is something barely understood by either side. That history is not simply one of mutual and continuous hatred dating back to the Crusades. A fascinating new book, Islam In Britain: 1558-1685, by Nabil Mater, claims that through the Renaissance and beyond \"Muslims and their Arab-Islamic legacy were part of the religious, commercial and military self-definition of England\". In drama and theology, in churches and in fashionable coffee houses (coffee was brought from Turkey and called the Mahometan berry), among merchants, weavers, writers and painters, Islam was ever present and exerted a subliminal influence. It was the fear and fascination epitomised by Othello. The frescoes in the House of Commons and many Mogul miniature paintings reflect the mutual respect felt by two civilisations when they first encountered each other. White collectors loved so much of what they saw in Muslim countries, they took vast amounts of it. The British Library, the V&amp;A and the British Museum between them hold the greatest collections of Islamic manuscripts and paintings in the world. To marvel at Islamic art and design you have only to go to Leighton House in London's Holland Park, where entire rooms are packed out with such loveliness it makes me cry. From Brighton Pavilion to William Morris prints, Islam has inspired those who were supposed to hate it. We are forever grappling with such contradictions. There is what one commentator, William Dalrymple, has called \"a peculiarly British strain of headbanging hostility to Muslims\", yet well-heeled aficionados still flock to sales at Christie's to buy that gold-plated Koran, medieval Persian vase or 15th-century Mamluk brass lamp. Always present, too, is the \"Orientalism\" that Edward Said writes about, by which he means a kind of historical and artistic dread of the east, for its supposed barbarism, violence and lack of culture. Rana Kabbani, in her book, Imperial Fictions, shows how Europeans portrayed Muslims negatively in order to justify their colonial ambitions. Popular painters such as Edwin Long (The Babylonian Slave, 1875), John Faed (Bedouin exchanging a slave for armour, 1857), even Ingres (Le Bain Turc, 1862) did much to promote the idea of the Islamic east as dangerous, lewd and irrational. But bigotry is never the whole story. For their part, the present crop of Muslim artists reject simplistic ideas about the east and west and are also questioning what seems to them a senseless disengagement with anything western. Wijdaan Ali, author of the priceless Modern Islamic Art, shows how a productive exchange - unmarred by prejudice - became possible, and how western aesthetics and art stimulated many Muslim artists. Canvas and paint came into their lives for a start. Egypt opened a school of modern art in 1908, and influential Arab artists publicly condemned the Nazi demonisation of Bauhaus painters such as Paul Klee. Surrealism, Cubism and Abstract Expressionism were embraced. Beirut, Baghdad, Tehran and Amman flourished as centres of artistic excellence. Look at the brilliant paintings (Mother and Child, for example) of the Algerian painter, Mohammed Issiakhem, and you can see just how fecund this relationship between the colonised and the colonisers had become in spite of the great inequality between them. But it could not last. The architect Ayub Malik thinks this cross-fertilisation led to \"art in drag\", which was pretending an authenticity it had given away the day it dislocated from a living artistic tradition to become an accessory to the west. \"Art sitting on its bottom in a gallery, painted with paints that no ordinary Muslims would ever be able to afford. Do you call this Islamic art?\" Many artists came to understand that they could never be wholly western or carelessly hybrid. Some felt they had amputated their roots and resented the implications that they were forever in the process of catching up. A void was created that affected British Muslims, too. The oil crisis in the 70s created unimaginable wealth for some Muslims, and new stereotypes emerged of rich, fat Arabs in sunglasses. This deeply affected Sheikh Zaki Yamani, the dashing Saudi spokesperson, who refused to defer to those who thought they owned the world, and so the oil in his country. He set up the Al Furqan Islamic Heritage Centre in south London, which has become an important collection point for Muslim manuscripts, thinkers and critics. Their current project is to salvage the precious ancient Islamic manuscripts, many of which were deliberately damaged by Serb soldiers in Bosnia. The director of the centre is the novelist Ahdaf Soueif herself. The Islamic Arts Foundation was set up in 1981 for similar reasons. It publishes the glossy periodical Arts And The Islamic World. It is not simply about the past, says Jalal Uddin Ahmed, a man steeped in knowledge and a lust for beauty: \"British Muslims cannot ever abscond from their heritage or hide in it. You must transform the past, but you must know it first. And this is happening. Dr Ahmed Moustapha is the world's greatest calligrapher, whose work is in the Vatican. He lives here now. His creations meet a need for a new identity among our young who are still seeking their place. From his great work they learn that, to influence mainstream society, you have to deserve it. Understand, deserve before you desire, that is what I tell those who are searching for that new identity.\" What is fascinating is how this search for an identity is leading to three distinct artistic responses. You have the reclaimers, the rebels, and the people who are trying to make new artistic settlements with their adoptive country. The reclaimers would include Ermes. For him, art is an act of worship. Unfortunately, these days you are as likely to find his pictures in the lobbies of Malaysian hotels as in the British Museum. Of the three Abrahamic faiths, only Christians have broken the holy injunction not to create the image of God or the prophets. And, although others disagree, Ermes believes that any figurative painting is just as wrong: \"We are not in the business of worshipping icons. How can this gift be wasted by painting the face of a queen? We must discover new shapes, new modes of reflecting the spiritual. Why replicate nature which God has made?\" I personally love the idea of art for God's sake. There is something so looming and overwhelming about these artists. At VITA, Claire Cooke, who embroiders shawls (yes it is art, not merely craft) says, \"The sacred has gone out of our society. This is transcendental art. It has a deeper meaning.\" Martin Moller, the Danish glass blower, is transformed by a new sense of spirituality. David Fuerestien, an Anglo-Swiss traditional artist - in the sense that his art is devotional, though modern in style - believes that there is too much ego in modern western art and that \"there is an emptiness. This art - my tiles, my fountain - is bigger than me or you. The complexity of sacred geometry puts you in your place in the universe.\" Others grapple with these bigger questions on a smaller scale. Fatima Zahrah Hassan paints miniatures in the Mogul style, but in order to personify the music she loves or the things she believes in. Her pictures are delicate and unexpectedly insolent, especially if you look at the faces of the women. But they are still part of a lost-and-found tradition. Then there are the rebels, whose art reflects the anger of always having to explain their position to their own as well as those on the outside. But that discontent itself generates a creativity that is edgy, interesting and thankfully devoid of complacency. The rebels do not rate the reclaimers. According to architect Ayub Malik, \"Art should be a moving, traumatic experience. British Muslim art is mostly fossilised in the past, the Prince Charles syndrome. It is being made for the sake of filling a space. Some spaces are better left empty. Only people lacking in self esteem look behind to the Taj or make fake gold domes to impress. We are in a state of formativeness and our art needs to reflect that.\" He is driven towards the future, and you can see this in his designs, which use glass mercilessly and then surrender to tradition with a tiny sculpture. It is that struggle of modernity versus memory that moves the novelist and playwright Ruksana Ahmed, too: \"Even if you have a distant relationship with Islam, your life is embattled by the values. There are lines of conduct. I am an individual, feminist, a writer and you do struggle against the forces which would deny you any of these.\" Yet she knows that everything that is authentic to her comes from that memory of a Muslim life lived once in Pakistan. Her play, River Of Fire, which is the Antigone story set in Mogul India, embodies these tensions. You would put Zarina Bhimji's disturbing work in this bracket. Or the provocative paintings of Farzana Adamjee, a small, strong woman with an unapologetic feminist agenda. She paints women all attempting to subvert their allocated spaces in life, letting their spirits out. Benazir Bhutto has just bought one work, a painting of women in chadors, where the garments are painted with such ferocious sensuality that, instead of de-sexing them, the women are turned into powerful temptresses. For some in this group, the responses to Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses have left an indelible mark. Ahmed, for example, says, \"I felt that the reactions against Rushdie were unnecessarily harsh. It made many of us petrified of our communities and the hideous self-censorship which was imposed. The imagination must be free of strictures and I resent what happened.\" You sense that this is what worries playwright Ayub Khan-Din, and so it should. There are those who have been busy gathering up protest against his film. The last group consists of those who feel that something new can be created out of two old traditions. The Al Furquan Centre is one symbol of this. When their building was first acquired, the good people of real England were not well pleased. It was their Jacobean house, albeit run down.

Also at Somerfield (and Kwik Save) is Ctes du Rhne Villages Lucien de Nobleus 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.49), which has a positive adult ripeness with an underlying herby dryness - savoury, plump, layered, with good, rich tannins, this has lovely lingering texture and depth. Somerfield's Riparosso Montepulciano d'Abruzzo 1997 (16 points, \u00a34.99, on offer at \u00a33.99 until February 1), has well-baked fruit that is textured and tending to lushness, but handsomely balanced and dry. It has multi-layered soft fruit and a resounding finish. </p> <p>Waitrose proudly presents Sierra Alta Shiraz Mendoza 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), an Argentine wine that has almost extravagant richness and smoothness, and thus provides plenty to occupy nose and throat. There is a gently throbbing undertone of excitement to this wine. Also at Waitrose is Verdicchio dei Castelli Jesi Moncaro 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.79), an organic wine of stunning flavour and class. It seems inconceivable that a Verdicchio could score so highly, be so concentrated, but there it is, and here it is: a Verdicchio with soul. </p> <p>Asda offers Cono Sur Chardonnay 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), from Chile, and utterly delicious it is, too: iconoclastic, rich, rivetingly fruity and very modern. Booths has Castillo de Almansa 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.99), from Spain, and what presence and charisma this white wine has. It is crisp, clean, collected, consummately dry and delicate. At Booths, there is also Spice Route Abbotsdale Colombard/Chenin 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.99), a superb marriage of grapes from the Cape. The theme is restrained apricots and gooseberries allied to complex yet unfussy acids. Sainsbury, selected branches thereof, has Santa Julia Viognier 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.79), from Argentina, and it is luxuriously textured and apricot-fruited, though subtly so, and has sufficient breadth and depth to tackle food. Also at Sainsbury is Kumala Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from South Africa, whose nuttiness has an attractive Italian fish-food feel to it. This wine offers brilliance without vulgarity and quietness without being dull - as one of Proust's railway passengers remarked of a noblewoman with similar characteristics, is this not the essence of real style?</p>",

Waitrose proudly presents Sierra Alta Shiraz Mendoza 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), an Argentine wine that has almost extravagant richness and smoothness, and thus provides plenty to occupy nose and throat. There is a gently throbbing undertone of excitement to this wine. Also at Waitrose is Verdicchio dei Castelli Jesi Moncaro 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.79), an organic wine of stunning flavour and class. It seems inconceivable that a Verdicchio could score so highly, be so concentrated, but there it is, and here it is: a Verdicchio with soul. Asda offers Cono Sur Chardonnay 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a34.49), from Chile, and utterly delicious it is, too: iconoclastic, rich, rivetingly fruity and very modern. Booths has Castillo de Almansa 1998 (16 points, \u00a33.99), from Spain, and what presence and charisma this white wine has. It is crisp, clean, collected, consummately dry and delicate. At Booths, there is also Spice Route Abbotsdale Colombard/Chenin 1998 (16 points, \u00a34.99), a superb marriage of grapes from the Cape. The theme is restrained apricots and gooseberries allied to complex yet unfussy acids. Sainsbury, selected branches thereof, has Santa Julia Viognier 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.79), from Argentina, and it is luxuriously textured and apricot-fruited, though subtly so, and has sufficient breadth and depth to tackle food. Also at Sainsbury is Kumala Chardonnay 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from South Africa, whose nuttiness has an attractive Italian fish-food feel to it. This wine offers brilliance without vulgarity and quietness without being dull - as one of Proust's railway passengers remarked of a noblewoman with similar characteristics, is this not the essence of real style?",

      "bodyText": "Last-ditch talks are to be held at ITN to avert strikes over changes to shifts which staff say will cause major disruption to their lives. Journalists and technicians will stage a 24-hour walkout on January 27 and a four-hour stoppage on January 31 unless there is a breakthrough during talks at the conciliation service Acas next week. Members of the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and Theatre Union (Bectu) and National Union of Journalists (NUJ) voted by 80% majorities to back industrial action at a mass meeting yesterday. Gerry Morrissey, Bectu's assistant general secretary, said: \"The changes put forward by ITN erode our members' family lives, which is totally unacceptable. The company can afford to introduce family-friendly working practices but refuses to do so.\" Managers want night working for all employees in plans to turn the station into a 24-hour news channel and to service its new contract to provide GMTV with news from next month. ITN said it understood changes would alter the working lives of some individuals. But its primary concern was job security and, to achieve that, it would have to be flexible enough to deliver services demanded by existing customers while branching out into new ones.",

      "bodyText": "A British surgeon yesterday told how he jetted across the Atlantic to take part in a pioneering double arm transplant lasting 17 hours and involving a team of 20 surgeons. Nadey Hakim, 41, had been lecturing in New York on Wednesday when he got a call that the ground-breaking surgery was taking place and immediately caught a flight to France. Within hours of arriving at the Edouard-Herriot hospital in Lyon he joined fellow surgeons, who had been operating since 6am, in the operation to transplant donor arms on to an explosives worker who had his limbs amputated following a factory blast four years ago. A fluent French speaker, Mr Hakim, surgical director of the transplant unit at St Mary's hospital in London, spent two hours operating on the man, who has not been named. \"You can imagine that with 20 people working on a particular body, it is very difficult surgery. You have to co-ordinate the work on both sides,\" he said from the French hospital. \"Whenever you do any operation the patient loses blood, and doing two big operations at the same time you lose twice as much, if not more.\" To reduce the risk of rejection both arms were taken from the same donor, who also has not been named. The team involved in the surgery was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, head of transplant surgery at the Edouard-Herriot hospital. Mr Dubernard said the patient, who took up marathon running after his amputation, was a good candidate for the operation because of his strong personality. The team worked until shortly before midnight on Thursday connecting arteries, veins, nerves, tendons and muscles, as well as setting the new bones. Mr Dubernard led the same team on the world's first arm transplant on New Zealander Clint Hallam two years ago. Mr Hakim, who qualified in Paris in 1983, said that the double transplant on the 33-year-old Frenchman had gone well, and that the patient was now comfortable. \"It is a relief because this is such a risky operation. Anything can go wrong and you can lose the patient at any time,\" the surgeon said. \"It was the same with the first operation but we kept our fingers crossed and it is now 17 or 18 months.\" He had been in New York lecturing on the 1998 transplant on Mr Hallam when he received the call to fly to Lyon to take part in the operation. \"It was incredible. I received the call 20 minutes before I was giving a lecture about the first transplant,\" he said. Mr Hakim added: \"I was very proud to be here as a representative of Britain.\" The team of surgeons had gathered before Christmas to discuss the operation but at the time no donor was available. The surgery to transplant the arms is not without risk and the patient will have to take medication to stop his body from rejecting the new arms, but this also leaves the patient more vulnerable to other diseases. The hospital said yesterday that the transplant patient would undergo a course of powerful drugs, similar to the one given to Mr Hallam. Mr Hallam has experienced no significant signs of rejection of his new hand and forearm, surgeons say.",

And it is this networked future that most analysts expect Gates to focus on in his new role. </p> <p>Ashok Kumar, analyst at stockbrokers Piper Jaffray, said: \"Microsoft will want to develop software for the network.

This means that anything from an individual's diary to contact details and books they want to read on holiday could be filed on to a computer and then downloaded when required. </p> <p>There were signs the $500bn company was changing.

But he wants nothing less than for consumers around the world to access anything they need from the latest movie to the latest Harvard research report from any device all using Microsoft software. While other companies such as Sun Microsystems or Novell have focused on the huge market for business customers, Microsoft is likely to want to use its brand name to offer services to consumers as well as big business. </p> <p>His interest in software has taken him into all sorts of areas. He has talked about a home where Microsoft software can lock your doors and turn off your lights at night. In building his $50m house near the Microsoft campus in Seattle, he attempted to prove that it already could.</p> <p>His other software dreams include an involvement with a university research project at Carnegie Mellon looking at building an electronic model of the human brain.

The company failed to appreciate the impact of Netscape's browser and was overtaken by smaller, hi-tech companies such as AltaVista and Yahoo!. </p> <p>The Seattle-based giant's whole modus operandi has been called into question by the coming of the web. Although Windows has been used on more than 90% of the world's computers for almost a decade, the company was slow to recognise that it would not be enough to control the web. One industry executive said yesterday: \"The days when Microsoft could offer a few shrink-wrapped applications for Windows are gone.\" </p> <p>Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: \"For Gates, I believe that this is about making the internet work for Microsoft. That's where his heart is.\" </p> <p>It has also been clear for some time, perhaps as far back as 1975 when Gates dropped out of Harvard to build an operating system, that his heart is not on business matters. He said this week that his new role will enable him to go home at night and think of \"databases and user interfaces rather than business models and cost structures\". His decision was called a \"wake-up call\" by one industry executive.

He is widely considered to have seriously misjudged his behaviour during the landmark anti-monopoly battle.

      "body": "<p>One in four people over 50 is so wary of new technology that they would refuse to use the internet or telephone advice lines to access public services, research for the government has established.</p> <p>The finding has prompted ministers to qualify their enthusiasm for \"electronic government\", accepting that older people's attitudes may take a long time to change - if at all.</p> <p>Ian McCartney, cabinet office minister overseeing the drive to modernise government, said yesterday: \"We must ensure that the use of new technology to improve our public services does not isolate older people, who may prefer to get their questions answered in person rather than over the phone or through the internet.\"</p> <p>The call for caution on technology comes in response to survey data from the \"people's panel\", the government's sounding board of 5,000 people who are canvassed for views on public services.</p> <p>Analysis of the responses of more than 2,000 panel members aged over 50 has revealed some marked differences from the views of the panel as a whole. In particular, only 34% of the older group said they were optimistic about the effects of new technology, compared with 52% of the entire panel and some 70% of those aged 16-24.</p> <p>A quarter of those over 50 said they would not be prepared to use any form of new technology to get information or advice, buy products or deal with government in any way.</p> <p>All parts of government, national and central, are under instruction to introduce electronic forms of administration. But ministers are conscious that older people represent an increasingly important section of the electorate: by 2031, 41% of the population will be over 50.</p> <p>Moreover, older people are more likely to exercise their vote in elections and traditionally have been less likely to support Labour.</p> <p>Officials believe that older people's resistance to new technology tends to reduce sharply once they have experience of it, however. Four in 10 panel members over 50 said they had no experience of computer or phone services in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>The panel survey, conducted by Mori, also indicated that older people may be growing less tolerant of sub-standard public services.</p> <p>Although it is commonly supposed that people who came through the second world war and post-war rationing continue to be grateful for public services, whatever their quality, only 25% of over-50s surveyed agreed such services were efficient, 29% hard working and 36% friendly.</p> <p>These findings differed hardly at all from those of the panel as a whole. But over-50s did still respond more favourably on most public services when asked about satisfaction with them.</p> <p>The survey results will be used to shape policy decisions affecting older people in the next three-year spending round, now under discussion.</p> <p>\u0095 The North Wales village with the longest name in Britain has set a new world record with the lengthiest address in cyberspace. Internet sites normally have a maximum of 28 letters but the rules have been bent for the Anglesey village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll Llantysiliogogogoch - known locally as Llanfair PG .</p> <p>Visitors to the site can even log on to a sound file to brush up on their pronunciation of the 58-letter name - which when translated means \"St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St Tysilio of the red cave\".</p> <p>According to the website, until the 19th century the village was known as Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll - St Mary's church near the pool by the white hazels. To encourage train travellers to stop, a cobbler came up with the marketing ploy of lengthening the name.</p> <p>But local author John Williams credits a tailor with coining the tongue-twisting name to confuse the English.</p> <p>The website is at: <a href=\"http://llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">http://llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.co.uk/ </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "One in four people over 50 is so wary of new technology that they would refuse to use the internet or telephone advice lines to access public services, research for the government has established. The finding has prompted ministers to qualify their enthusiasm for \"electronic government\", accepting that older people's attitudes may take a long time to change - if at all. Ian McCartney, cabinet office minister overseeing the drive to modernise government, said yesterday: \"We must ensure that the use of new technology to improve our public services does not isolate older people, who may prefer to get their questions answered in person rather than over the phone or through the internet.\" The call for caution on technology comes in response to survey data from the \"people's panel\", the government's sounding board of 5,000 people who are canvassed for views on public services. Analysis of the responses of more than 2,000 panel members aged over 50 has revealed some marked differences from the views of the panel as a whole. In particular, only 34% of the older group said they were optimistic about the effects of new technology, compared with 52% of the entire panel and some 70% of those aged 16-24. A quarter of those over 50 said they would not be prepared to use any form of new technology to get information or advice, buy products or deal with government in any way. All parts of government, national and central, are under instruction to introduce electronic forms of administration. But ministers are conscious that older people represent an increasingly important section of the electorate: by 2031, 41% of the population will be over 50. Moreover, older people are more likely to exercise their vote in elections and traditionally have been less likely to support Labour. Officials believe that older people's resistance to new technology tends to reduce sharply once they have experience of it, however. Four in 10 panel members over 50 said they had no experience of computer or phone services in the previous 12 months. The panel survey, conducted by Mori, also indicated that older people may be growing less tolerant of sub-standard public services. Although it is commonly supposed that people who came through the second world war and post-war rationing continue to be grateful for public services, whatever their quality, only 25% of over-50s surveyed agreed such services were efficient, 29% hard working and 36% friendly. These findings differed hardly at all from those of the panel as a whole. But over-50s did still respond more favourably on most public services when asked about satisfaction with them. The survey results will be used to shape policy decisions affecting older people in the next three-year spending round, now under discussion. \u0095 The North Wales village with the longest name in Britain has set a new world record with the lengthiest address in cyberspace. Internet sites normally have a maximum of 28 letters but the rules have been bent for the Anglesey village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwll Llantysiliogogogoch - known locally as Llanfair PG . Visitors to the site can even log on to a sound file to brush up on their pronunciation of the 58-letter name - which when translated means \"St Mary's church in the hollow of the white hazel near a rapid whirlpool and the Church of St Tysilio of the red cave\". According to the website, until the 19th century the village was known as Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll - St Mary's church near the pool by the white hazels. To encourage train travellers to stop, a cobbler came up with the marketing ploy of lengthening the name. But local author John Williams credits a tailor with coining the tongue-twisting name to confuse the English. The website is at: http://llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.co.uk/",

      "bodyText": "Downing Street yesterday launched a carefully orchestrated operation to discredit the fertility pioneer Lord Winston after he unleashed a devastating attack on the government's handling of the NHS. Amid fury at the disloyalty of the Labour peer, the prime minister's official spokesman held talks with Lord Winston early yesterday. Alastair Campbell sprung into action after the Labour peer accused the government, in a New Statesman interview, of failing to live up to its promises on the NHS and of being \"quite deceitful\" about its desperate state. In a passage that was said to have upset Cherie Blair, Lord Winston disclosed that the prime minister's wife would undergo a caesarean section at a London hospital. As damaging headlines hit the news-stands, Mr Campbell arranged with Lord Winston to issue a statement categorically denying that he had ever discussed Mrs Blair's birth plans. Within an hour of Lord Winston's statement, the New Statesman allowed the BBC to play a tape of his remarks about Mrs Blair on Radio 4's The World at One. The tape was inaudible - Lord Winston was said to have covered the magazine's tape recorder during his interview - but the BBC confirmed that his remarks were on the tape. Armed with evidence that Lord Winston had appeared to break medical convention by discussing the personal details of a patient, ministers then embarked on a media offensive against him. His claims that the NHS had deteriorated since the election, and that ministers were deceiving the public about the state of hospitals, were described as \"fanciful\". Lord Winston, a political novice who failed to realise the impact his remarks would have, also issued a less than convincing statement claiming he had not meant to attack the government. \"I believe that the basic direction of NHS policy is right under this government,\" he said. The Conservatives were scathing about the Downing Street operations against Lord Winston. Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, said: \"The Alastair Campbell press machine seems to be more capable of getting heretics to recant than the Inquisition.\" The Intensive Care Society, which represents 1,500 doctors and nurses, accused the health secretary, Alan Milburn, of misleading the public when he said that more intensive care beds had been provided.

      "body": "<p>During the rush of retrospective programmes that furred up the millennium television schedules, my seven-year-old son caught sight of an apparition. He had been watching a programme about the sporting century and came hurtling upstairs to tell me he had seen the greatest, no question about it. </p> <p>\"This bloke, right,\" he said, \"ran the whole length of the pitch, past everyone, no one could stop him, then he scored. It was brilliant. It was the best goal I've ever seen.\" </p> <p>\"Who was it?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"I think he was called Madonna,\" he said. \"How come I've never heard of him before?\" </p> <p>Good point. As he lies in his hospital bed, pushed to the brink of self-destruction by habits almost as prodigious as his talent, perhaps it is time for the rest of us in this country to put into perspective at last the genius that was Diego Maradona. Only in England do we churlishly belittle the man, only in England (and the United States, but then what do you expect?) was his name absent from lists compiled to celebrate the century's greatest sportsmen, only in England is his awful decline depicted as some sort of divine retribution for having the audacity once to cheat against us. And all because of a sly piece of gamesmanship involving the hand of God. </p> <p>\"You've got to say that was brilliant,\" sighed Barry Davies on the television commentary after Maradona had left Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, Terry Fenwick and Peter Shilton bewildered in his wash that day in 1986, proving he was even more adept with his feet than his hands. And the grudging tone has been evident ever since. When Eric Cantona came to England, his answer to the inevitable question about his greatest footballing hero was always Maradona. Cantona said he was surprised that, whenever he said this, his questioner would raise an eyebrow and look askance as if the choice indicated an awful moral deficiency on his part. </p> <p>In Argentina the population is certainly aware of what Maradona means. Outside the hospital in Buenos Aires in which he is being treated for cocaine-induced heart problems, a large crowd stands vigil. This week one bystander asked English reporters to imagine what the reaction in Britain would be if it was Paul Gascoigne in hospital. </p> <p>Well, not quite. However popular Gazza may once have been, he has never single-handedly taken his country to a World Cup victory, or driven an unfashionable club side to the Italian championship, or roused his battered, shattered limbs to steer his nation to another World Cup final. </p> <p>In England we are happy to deify a teenager who scored a good goal in a defeat in the last-16 stage of the World Cup.

      "bodyText": "During the rush of retrospective programmes that furred up the millennium television schedules, my seven-year-old son caught sight of an apparition. He had been watching a programme about the sporting century and came hurtling upstairs to tell me he had seen the greatest, no question about it. \"This bloke, right,\" he said, \"ran the whole length of the pitch, past everyone, no one could stop him, then he scored. It was brilliant. It was the best goal I've ever seen.\" \"Who was it?\" I asked. \"I think he was called Madonna,\" he said. \"How come I've never heard of him before?\" Good point. As he lies in his hospital bed, pushed to the brink of self-destruction by habits almost as prodigious as his talent, perhaps it is time for the rest of us in this country to put into perspective at last the genius that was Diego Maradona. Only in England do we churlishly belittle the man, only in England (and the United States, but then what do you expect?) was his name absent from lists compiled to celebrate the century's greatest sportsmen, only in England is his awful decline depicted as some sort of divine retribution for having the audacity once to cheat against us. And all because of a sly piece of gamesmanship involving the hand of God. \"You've got to say that was brilliant,\" sighed Barry Davies on the television commentary after Maradona had left Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, Terry Fenwick and Peter Shilton bewildered in his wash that day in 1986, proving he was even more adept with his feet than his hands. And the grudging tone has been evident ever since. When Eric Cantona came to England, his answer to the inevitable question about his greatest footballing hero was always Maradona. Cantona said he was surprised that, whenever he said this, his questioner would raise an eyebrow and look askance as if the choice indicated an awful moral deficiency on his part. In Argentina the population is certainly aware of what Maradona means. Outside the hospital in Buenos Aires in which he is being treated for cocaine-induced heart problems, a large crowd stands vigil. This week one bystander asked English reporters to imagine what the reaction in Britain would be if it was Paul Gascoigne in hospital. Well, not quite. However popular Gazza may once have been, he has never single-handedly taken his country to a World Cup victory, or driven an unfashionable club side to the Italian championship, or roused his battered, shattered limbs to steer his nation to another World Cup final. In England we are happy to deify a teenager who scored a good goal in a defeat in the last-16 stage of the World Cup. Imagine how we would have reacted to a man who brought us what Maradona brought Argentina, the international prestige, the excuse to puff out its collective chest on the global stage, the sheer pleasure of ultimate victory. As everyone else in the world seemed to recognise, Maradona, to achieve what he did, was simply astonishing. Not only did he have more skill in his left foot than the entire Premiership added together, he had guile, balance, strength, courage and the ability to deliver on the big stage.

      "body": "<p>Who is the key influence on modern British theatre? Paradoxically, it is Peter Brook, who left these shores almost 30 years ago. A whole generation of directors - including Declan Donnellan, Simon McBurney, Deborah Warner, Katie Mitchell, Tim Supple and Mick Gordon - perpetuate the Brook principles: a belief in story-telling, in imaginative complicity between actor and audience, in the importance of found spaces. Even a great classical production, such as Michael Boyd's current RSC Midsummer Night's Dream, is a reaction to Brook's landmark version of 1970, despite the fact that hardly anyone involved is old enough to have seen it. </p> <p>Brook, who will be 75 in March, continues his quest for the essence of theatre at the Bouffes du Nord in Paris. Recently he has been fascinated by the mysteries of the human mind: L'Homme Qui was an Oliver Sacks-inspired exploration of neurological disorder; Je Suis un Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne was about the curse of indiscriminate memory. But his latest production, Le Costume, is a poetic South African fable, staged in London in 1995 by Johannesburg's Market Theatre, about a husband's strange revenge on his unfaithful wife. What Brook brings to it is his own brand of evocative simplicity - a delight in the act of theatre as an alternative to the mundane realism of TV and cinema that, in various ways, ran through everything I saw in Paris. </p> <p>Brook creates a definable world on stage, in this case that of 50s Sophiatown, a township in Johannesburg, where Can Themba's original story and Mothobi Mutloatse's adaptation are set. We see vividly coloured rush matting, a pair of suit racks serving as doors and windows, a double bed - the pivot of the action in which Philemon, a young husband, almost discovers his ex-showbiz wife, Matilda, in flagrante. The key trace of the disappearing lover is his grey suit, which Philemon turns into a domestic totem. The suit is fed at meal-times, taken for walks and turned into an honoured guest at a party - a form of silent revenge that eventually destroys Matilda in the manner of Heywood's A Woman Killed with Kindness. </p> <p>Without minimising the story's cruelty, Brook deftly suggests the contradictory festivity of township life. Music dominates the action: at a party, Bakary Sangare's Philemon and two guests do the most elegant soft-shoe shuffle over and around the double bed; Marianne-Jean Baptiste's Matilda is haunted by memories of her showbiz past as she gaily sings My Little Yellow Basket. Even the suit is equivocal - both a reminder of Matilda's guilt and, as she puts her hand through the sleeve to caress her thighs and breast, a symbol of remembered sensual delight. </p> <p> Nothing is overstated. Through the use of vivid primary colours, orange sunsets and exuberant drumming, Brook shows us that domestic tragedy erupts in a world of communal gaiety and that township life is a source of gregarious entrapment. He also reminds us that it takes a lifetime's work to achieve such simplicity. </p> <p>At the opposite end of the scale, Paris is also a source of spectacle, and spectacles don't come much bigger than Robert Hossein's staging of De Gaulle - Celui Qui a Dit Non, which re-creates the general's intransigent wartime belief in a \"Free France\" before 3,000 spectators a night at the vast Palais de Congr\u00e8s. We get film footage of the German occupation and of Marshal P\u00e9tain's Vichy regime. We get tableaux vivants of key moments of the war. We get running battles in the aisles. But beneath the pageantry we get a series of confrontations between Jacques Boudet's imperious De Gaulle and Robert Hardy's growling Churchill. </p> <p>It would be easy to mock the show's kitsch grandeur. But the main story, written by Alain Decaux and Alain Peyrefitte, expresses a central truth, that there was a strange, grudging, symbiotic kinship between De Gaulle and Churchill. As historian Eric Hobsbawm once wrote, the former was a reactionary Catholic who had \" une certaine id\u00e9e de la France \", the latter an imperialist Conservative with a profound sense of England. Even the recent revelations that Churchill was overruled by his wartime Cabinet in seeking to ditch De Gaulle are acknowledged. At one point Churchill actually tells him that \"the worst moment for France was the hour that you were born\". But, spiritually the two men were blood brothers, and I don't think it is mere chauvinism that makes me feel that Hardy's wily, devious and heroically cussed Churchill is every bit as fascinating as Boudet's single-minded, unyielding De Gaulle. It may be spectacle on the scale of the Royal Tournament, but there is something oddly moving about seeing the French turning their wartime history into popular theatre. </p> <p>Paris, in fact, seems to delight in the theatricality of theatre, and you could hardly have a better example than in the work of Ariane Mnouchkine's Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil at the Cartoucherie at Vincennes, in the east of the city. In Britain we have seen only her 1789 at the Roundhouse and Les Atrides in Bradford. But she is one of the great European directors, and her current production of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous's Tambours Sur la Digue is an astonishing amalgam of ideas from Gordon Craig, Bertolt Brecht and Japanese No and bunraku. </p> <p>Cixous has come up with an oriental fable, the story of a patriarchal community faced with a moral dilemma about whether to save the city or the countryside from destruction by rising flood-water. Partly through its own internal power squabbles and partly through structural defects in its dyke, the community ends up totally engulfed. </p> <p>The characters, though played by live actors, are portrayed as marionettes manipulated by the masked, black-garbed figures of bunraku theatre. The result is visually hypnotic and intellectually arresting. It implies that all the characters are in the grip of determining external forces. But it also offers a vivid demonstration of Brechtian alienation: we focus on the story rather than individual psychology, yet we are riveted, even moved, by the technique of the actors. When one of the emperor's daughters, dies prematurely, we watch her stylised physical collapse - all jerks and twitches - and the deep anguish in the veiled eyes of her manipulator. </p> <p>When you add thrilling music on flutes, pipes and gamelans, fever-pitch drumming and expertly choreographed movement, you have a show that knocks the Lion King into several cocked hats and that, as so often in Paris, allies political content to a peculiar joy in the act of creating theatre. </p> <p> Le Costume is at the Bouffes du Nord (00 33 1 46 07 34 50) till January 29.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/authors/author/0,5917,-115,00.html\">Books Unlimited author page</a></p> <p>In January, 1950, small procession of visitors could be seen each afternoon making their way singly and severally through the cheerless north Bloomsbury squares towards University College hospital. Many of them were literary - the immensely tall figure of Stephen Spender with his mop of curly hair, Anthony Powell and Malcolm Muggeridge, both of whom lived in nearby Regent's Park. Others came from the BBC or from left-wing newspapers. Occasionally, a small boy was brought in and allowed to remain for a moment or so before a patient so terrified of communicating the disease from which he suffered, that he would never allow his adopted son to touch him. The most regular visitor was a spectacularly pretty, brown-haired girl with a newly acquired wedding ring gleaming on her finger. </p> <p>By January, 1950, Orwell had been at UCH for nearly four months, and in hospital since the start of the previous year. Two decades of chronic lung trouble had finally produced a diagnosis of tuberculosis. At a sanatorium in Gloucestershire, six months before, he had nearly died, but recovered enough to be transferred to London and the care of the distinguished chest specialist Andrew Morland. Morland, recommended to Orwell by his publisher Fred Warburg, didn't anticipate a cure: but he thought that, with sufficient care and treatment, he might reach the status of \"good chronic\", able to potter about and undertake a few hours' sedentary work a day. Orwell, desperate to pick up his pen once more, was told that he had a \"relatively\" good chance of staying alive. </p> <p>Morland had taken Orwell on as a private patient: little more than a year since its inception, Bevan's NHS had barely begun to exist. Fortunately money, the absence of which had troubled Orwell for most of his adult life, was no longer a problem. Nineteen Eighty-Four, published the previous June, had been a huge success on both sides of the Atlantic. 25,000 copies had already been sold in England. US royalties, fuelled by selection as a Book of the Month Club choice, were rolling in. Orwell was famous and well off. In the last month of his life, the value of his estate was put at around \u00a312,000 (the average weekly wage was well below \u00a310). He was also, despite the rigours of his hospital routine, unexpectedly happy. </p> <p>Orwell had known Sonia Brownell, who had worked on Cyril Connolly's monthly magazine Horizon, for several years. Sixteen years younger than Orwell, with a string of previous lovers that included the artists Lucian Freud and William Coldstream, Sonia looked an unlikely candidate for the role of second Mrs Orwell, a vacancy the widower had seemed anxious to fill during the late 1940s. Her reasons for accepting a desperately sick man, with whom she was fairly obviously not in love, will always be obscure. Subsequent accusations of gold-digging are unfounded. There was no guarantee when she married him that he was about to turn into the titanic figure of literary legend. Anthony Powell always maintained that Sonia married him simply because her mentor, Cyril Connolly, told her to. </p> <p>The marriage took place by special licence in Orwell's room on October 13, 1949. David Astor, proprietor of the Observer and a long-term supporter, gave away the bride in the presence of the hospital chaplain, the Reverend WH Braine, Sonia's friend Janetta Kee, Powell, Muggeridge and one of Orwell's doctors. The guests then went off for a celebratory dinner at the Ritz. The bridegroom remained in bed. Several of his friends noted how much the marriage raised his spirits. According to Powell, it \"immensely cheered him ... In some respects he was in better form than I had ever known.\" Despite his cadaverous state - he had lost so much weight that the doctors had trouble finding enough spare flesh to insert hypodermic needles - Orwell looked unexpectedly perky in it. Sitting up in bed, Powell remembered, he had an \"unaccustomedly epicurean air\". </p> <p>The plan had been that, as soon as Orwell showed faint signs of improvement, he could be sent to a sanatorium in the Swiss Alps to take advantage of the rarefied mountain air. But he remained horribly unwell, losing even more weight and suffering from high temperatures. The new American wonder drug streptomycin had been tried on him the year before, and Fred Warburg had petitioned his US publishers to help in speeding up a delivery of auromycin, but these were early days for TB cures. Among other side-effects, the streptomycin had made Orwell's fingernails fall out - and the prognosis grew worse. </p> <p>Orwell, though, was convinced he would live. Full of ideas for books - a study of Conrad's political fiction and a novella set in the far east, provisionally titled A Smoking-Room Story - he believed that a writer who has a book left in him to write will not die. Despite his poor state, Morland thought that the promise of the Swiss trip would have a beneficial effect and sanctioned it for January. A fishing rod, brought by a friend for his convalescence, lay at the end of the bed. </p> <p>By this stage, few of his visitors expected him to live. Some of the saddest visits were the few allowed to his adopted son, Richard. Orwell was so anxious about passing on the disease to the four-year-old that he pushed the boy away if he came too close. Sonia came every day, looked after his business affairs, and occasionally annoyed people by her assumption of the role of officious nurse. One day, Sonia told Orwell that she had to go to a cocktail party and wouldn't be back that evening. Orwell protested faintly, but she bustled off. Others noticed a progressive deterioration. Arriving with Powell on Christmas Day, Muggeridge found him \"very deathly and wretched, alone, with Christmas decorations all around\". His face looked practically dead, Muggeridge recorded, oddly like a picture he had once seen of Nietzsche on his death-bed. He detected a kind of rage in his friend's expression, as though the approach of death made him furious. They talked about Orwell's exploits in the Home Guard, his time in Spain in the civil war, the prospect of Switzerland, \"and all the while the stench of death was in the air, like autumn in a garden\". </p> <p>The new year came. A departure date had been set for January 25. Orwell's companions on the trip, by privately chartered plane, would be Sonia and Lucian Freud. Visiting again on the 12th, Muggeridge thought him \"more deathly than ever, very miserable,\" complaining that the doctors would not even allow him aspirin. A week later, though, Julian Symons found him eagerly anticipating the Swiss trip, and keen to talk about long-delayed literary schemes. </p> <p>There was a chance that the doctors might let him start writing again, he explained, and he was anxious to get on with the novella and the Conrad book. \"I shall go to Switzerland next Wednesday,\" Symons recalled him saying, laughing as he did so, \"if I don't catch cold.\" Another friend, the anarchist poet Paul Potts, called on him the next afternoon, Friday January 20, bringing a small packet of tea as a present. Looking through the glass square cut into the door, he saw that Orwell was asleep. Judging it best not to disturb him, he left the tea propped up against the lintel and stole away. </p> <p>Sonia spent the evening at a nightclub with Lucian Freud. In the small hours of Saturday Janu ary 21, she was tracked down by telephone to be told that Orwell had died of a massive lung haemorrhage. The news spread throughout the weekend. \"G Orwell is dead and Mrs Orwell, presumably, a rich widow,\" Evelyn Waugh noted in a letter to Nancy Mitford. Muggeridge, told of his friend's death early on the Saturday morning, compared it to the passing of another recent literary casualty, Hugh Kingsmill. </p> <p> Orwell's death was the sadder, however, \"because he passionately wanted to go on living, and there was no sense of peace or relinquishment in him.\" Muggeridge, then working on the Daily Telegraph, wrote a couple of memorial paragraphs for the Peterborough column. \"Thought of him, as of Graham [Greene], that popular writers always express in an intense form some romantic longing...\" </p> <p>The dead man turned out to have made a will three days before his death, in the presence of Sonia and his first wife's sister, Gwen O'Shaughnessy. Materially, it transferred his literary estate to Sonia. A substantial life insurance policy would provide for his adopted son, Richard, then being looked after by his aunt, Orwell's sister Avril. Orwell directed that he should be buried according to the rites of the Church of England and his body interred (not cremated) in the nearest convenient cemetery. The task of arranging all this fell to Powell and Muggeridge. A Warren Street undertaker was quickly brought on board. </p> <p>Then the two tried to engage the services of the Rev Rose, Vicar of Christ Church, Albany Street NWI. Astor influence secured a plot in the graveyard of All Saints church at Sutton Courteney in Oxfordshire. Muggeridge noted in his diary the fact of Orwell dying on Lenin's birthday and being buried by the Astors, \"which seems to me to cover the full range of his life\". </p> <p>The funeral was set for Thursday January 26. The evening before, Powell and his wife, Lady Violet, called in at the Muggeridges after supper, bringing Sonia with them, \"obviously in a poor way\". On their last meeting, the day after Orwell's death, Sonia had been overcome with grief. Muggeridge decided that he would \"always love her for her true tears...\" He left a detailed account of the next day's events: Fred Warburg greeting the mourners at the church door, the chilly atmosphere, the congregation \"largely Jewish and almost entirely unbelievers\" who had difficulty following the Anglican liturgy. Powell chose the hymns - \"All people that on earth do dwell,\" \"Guide me, 0 thou great Redeemer\" and \"Ten thousand times ten thousand\" (\"Why, I can't remember,\" Powell later wrote, \"perhaps Orwell himself had talked of the hymn, or because he was, in his way, a sort of saint, even if not one in sparkling raiment bright.\") </p> <p>Both Powell and Muggeridge found the occasion hugely distressing. Muggeridge, in particular, was deeply moved by the lesson, chosen by Powell from the Book of Ecclesiastes: \"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to the God who gave it.\" </p> <p>He went back to his house near Regent's Park to read through the sheaf of obituaries filed by, among others, Symons, VS Pritchett and Arthur Koestler, seeing in them already \"how the legend of a human being is created\".</p>",

Full of ideas for books - a study of Conrad's political fiction and a novella set in the far east, provisionally titled A Smoking-Room Story - he believed that a writer who has a book left in him to write will not die. Despite his poor state, Morland thought that the promise of the Swiss trip would have a beneficial effect and sanctioned it for January. A fishing rod, brought by a friend for his convalescence, lay at the end of the bed. By this stage, few of his visitors expected him to live. Some of the saddest visits were the few allowed to his adopted son, Richard. Orwell was so anxious about passing on the disease to the four-year-old that he pushed the boy away if he came too close. Sonia came every day, looked after his business affairs, and occasionally annoyed people by her assumption of the role of officious nurse. One day, Sonia told Orwell that she had to go to a cocktail party and wouldn't be back that evening. Orwell protested faintly, but she bustled off. Others noticed a progressive deterioration. Arriving with Powell on Christmas Day, Muggeridge found him \"very deathly and wretched, alone, with Christmas decorations all around\". His face looked practically dead, Muggeridge recorded, oddly like a picture he had once seen of Nietzsche on his death-bed. He detected a kind of rage in his friend's expression, as though the approach of death made him furious. They talked about Orwell's exploits in the Home Guard, his time in Spain in the civil war, the prospect of Switzerland, \"and all the while the stench of death was in the air, like autumn in a garden\". The new year came. A departure date had been set for January 25. Orwell's companions on the trip, by privately chartered plane, would be Sonia and Lucian Freud. Visiting again on the 12th, Muggeridge thought him \"more deathly than ever, very miserable,\" complaining that the doctors would not even allow him aspirin. A week later, though, Julian Symons found him eagerly anticipating the Swiss trip, and keen to talk about long-delayed literary schemes. There was a chance that the doctors might let him start writing again, he explained, and he was anxious to get on with the novella and the Conrad book. \"I shall go to Switzerland next Wednesday,\" Symons recalled him saying, laughing as he did so, \"if I don't catch cold.\" Another friend, the anarchist poet Paul Potts, called on him the next afternoon, Friday January 20, bringing a small packet of tea as a present. Looking through the glass square cut into the door, he saw that Orwell was asleep. Judging it best not to disturb him, he left the tea propped up against the lintel and stole away. Sonia spent the evening at a nightclub with Lucian Freud. In the small hours of Saturday Janu ary 21, she was tracked down by telephone to be told that Orwell had died of a massive lung haemorrhage. The news spread throughout the weekend. \"G Orwell is dead and Mrs Orwell, presumably, a rich widow,\" Evelyn Waugh noted in a letter to Nancy Mitford. Muggeridge, told of his friend's death early on the Saturday morning, compared it to the passing of another recent literary casualty, Hugh Kingsmill. Orwell's death was the sadder, however, \"because he passionately wanted to go on living, and there was no sense of peace or relinquishment in him.\" Muggeridge, then working on the Daily Telegraph, wrote a couple of memorial paragraphs for the Peterborough column. \"Thought of him, as of Graham [Greene], that popular writers always express in an intense form some romantic longing...\" The dead man turned out to have made a will three days before his death, in the presence of Sonia and his first wife's sister, Gwen O'Shaughnessy. Materially, it transferred his literary estate to Sonia. A substantial life insurance policy would provide for his adopted son, Richard, then being looked after by his aunt, Orwell's sister Avril. Orwell directed that he should be buried according to the rites of the Church of England and his body interred (not cremated) in the nearest convenient cemetery. The task of arranging all this fell to Powell and Muggeridge. A Warren Street undertaker was quickly brought on board. Then the two tried to engage the services of the Rev Rose, Vicar of Christ Church, Albany Street NWI. Astor influence secured a plot in the graveyard of All Saints church at Sutton Courteney in Oxfordshire. Muggeridge noted in his diary the fact of Orwell dying on Lenin's birthday and being buried by the Astors, \"which seems to me to cover the full range of his life\". The funeral was set for Thursday January 26. The evening before, Powell and his wife, Lady Violet, called in at the Muggeridges after supper, bringing Sonia with them, \"obviously in a poor way\". On their last meeting, the day after Orwell's death, Sonia had been overcome with grief. Muggeridge decided that he would \"always love her for her true tears...\" He left a detailed account of the next day's events: Fred Warburg greeting the mourners at the church door, the chilly atmosphere, the congregation \"largely Jewish and almost entirely unbelievers\" who had difficulty following the Anglican liturgy. Powell chose the hymns - \"All people that on earth do dwell,\" \"Guide me, 0 thou great Redeemer\" and \"Ten thousand times ten thousand\" (\"Why, I can't remember,\" Powell later wrote, \"perhaps Orwell himself had talked of the hymn, or because he was, in his way, a sort of saint, even if not one in sparkling raiment bright.\") Both Powell and Muggeridge found the occasion hugely distressing. Muggeridge, in particular, was deeply moved by the lesson, chosen by Powell from the Book of Ecclesiastes: \"Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to the God who gave it.\" He went back to his house near Regent's Park to read through the sheaf of obituaries filed by, among others, Symons, VS Pritchett and Arthur Koestler, seeing in them already \"how the legend of a human being is created\".",

      "body": "<p><strong> Dear John,</strong></p> <p> I'm sure that you and I agree on one thing: that it's quite wrong for employers to dismiss their employees unfairly, or to discriminate on grounds of race or gender. The system of employment tribunals is a good one and, in many cases, can right situations where employers have breached the rules. So why am I worried about the developments in compensation payouts that are now taking place? </p> <p>Employees already bring many frivolous cases against employers. Taking average figures for recent years, I understand that about 45% of cases are either withdrawn before reaching the tribunal, or fail at the tribunal. In other words, nearly half of all the cases are frivolous, if not capricious. But, whether frivolous or not, the employer has to prepare his or her case, frequently incurring legal costs, in order to defend himself or herself. This can be hugely time-consuming, expensive and damaging, especially for small businesses. And there's no compensation for the employer if he or she \"wins\": today's compensation culture is strictly one-way. </p> <p>Given the explosion in employment regulations, media coverage of huge compensation payments and increasing litigiousness, I fear these frivolous cases will rise dramatically. How are employers - especially small employers - going to cope? </p> <p>Yours sincerely, </p> <p>Ruth Lea <br>Head of Policy, <br>Institute of Directors </p> <p><strong> Dear Ruth,</strong></p> <p> You're right! I do agree that employers should obey the law. You're troubled by the burden on employers of frivolous employment tribunal cases. You have perhaps forgotten that an employment tribunal can and will order the costs of one side to be paid by the other where the latter has acted \"frivolously, vexatiously, abusively disruptively or otherwise unreasonably\". </p> <p>But two things trouble me about the special exemptions granted to employers, especially in the area of unfair dismissal. First, no matter how unfair the dismissal, an employee dismissed within a year of starting work with an employer is barred from bringing an unfair dismissal claim. Second, an employer cannot be obliged to take back an unfairly dismissed employee where a tribunal has ordered it. </p> <p>You refer to \"today's compensation culture\", but surely employers and their insurers must be rejoicing in the government's decision to abolish legal aid for personal injury cases? This will mean that thousands of workers will no longer be able to sue their employers for injury or death caused by breach of health and safety laws. True, unions will take these cases for free - as in the case of the gipsy site worker who received damages this week - but most workers aren't in unions. Lawyers can do these cases on a no-win, no-fee basis, but they will only take the risk in the very strongest cases. </p> <p>You can rest assured that the courts and tribunals are assiduous in throwing out frivolous cases. The real injustice is not a compensation culture, but a culture in which innocent people suffer injury and loss by lawbreaking employers and yet cannot get compensation for it. </p> <p>Yours, </p> <p>John Hendy QC <br>Institute of Employment Rights </p> <p><strong> Dear John,</strong></p> <p> I hadn't forgotten that costs can be awarded to employers in some very specific circumstances, but such costs can never meet the damaging disruption to businesses - especially to small businesses - that frivolous cases cause. There is no adequate compensation for such damage. And the fact that tribunals are \"assiduous\" in throwing out frivolous cases does not invalidate this point. </p> <p>But the \"compensation culture\" is all too vigorous. Recent estimates suggest that it costs the country \u00a37.5bn a year, and some recent payouts have been extraordinarily inflated. Moreover, there has been an explosion of tribunal cases faced by employers. In 1998/99 there were 136,000; 31% higher than the previous year. As Acas has acknowledged, the rapid rise reflects increased litigiousness and extended employment rights, and there are more to come. Small employers feel powerless in the face of such an onslaught. </p> <p>As for industrial injuries cases, lawyers can do them on a no-win, no-fee basis, as indeed you say, insofar as public funding has been withdrawn for them. If lawyers believe a case has a good chance of winning then they would surely take it on. If not, it shouldn't go to court. If lawyers are responsible and rational people - and, in my experience, they are - then no innocent person who has suffered injury and loss by a lawbreaking employer should fail to get his or her compensation. </p> <p>Yours sincerely, </p> <p>Ruth </p> <p><strong> Dear Ruth,</strong></p> <p> You accept that tribunals throw out frivolous claims and that employers can get costs orders; remember also that tribunals can strike out vexatious claims at any stage. Employers are well-protected against the costs and disruption of fighting vexatious cases. What you're really seeking, it seems, is the removal of unfair dismissal claims altogether: that would certainly stop vexatious ones, but it would stop justified ones, too. </p> <p>I hope the lawbreaking of employers doesn't cost the country \u00a37.5bn a year! That cost should fall fairly and squarely on the shoulders of employers who flout the law. The real significance of this figure - and of the increase in the number of cases fought and won - is that it shows the massive extent of bad employers. And don't forget that because of limits on compensation for unfair dismissal, redundancy, failures to consult and the like, \u00a37.5bn is nowhere near the total financial losses caused to employee victims. What your figure reveals is not a compensation culture, but a culture of lawlessness among employers. </p> <p>As for injury cases - yes, lawyers are rational people: they will not take on cases where they think there is a significant chance of not being paid. So injured people with good but not overwhelming cases - people, that is, with a 50-70% chance of success - will find it difficult, and in some cases impossible, to get compensation. </p> <p>Yours, </p> <p>John </p> <p><strong>Dear John, </strong></p> <p> May I start by repeating that there is no adequate compensation for the damaging disruption caused to businesses, especially small ones, by frivolous tribunal cases. Every case has to be dealt with, and until the tribunal makes a decision, no businessman or woman knows whether or not it will be stopped. Coping with such cases can have huge opportunity costs, and almost cripple small and vulnerable firms. Incidentally, you imply I am seeking the removal of all claims. Not so. </p> <p>Concerning the \u00a37.5bn, I'm afraid you misunderstood the nature of the figure. It refers to the total costs to the country of the compensation culture, and includes \u00a34bn paid by the NHS, emergency services and local government. Legal fees totalled \u00a31bn - a nice little earner! - and less than 20% was attributed to the private sector, hardly a culture of lawlessness among employers. </p> <p>I was surprised, if not amazed, that you implied that only dead cert cases - or near as dammit dead cert - would be handled by lawyers. Such a stance seems quite extraordinarily restrictive and unjust. Some people may think lawyers should adopt a less risk-averse - and more generous - approach. </p> <p>Yours, </p> <p>Ruth </p> <p><strong> Dear Ruth,</strong></p> <p> You complain of inadequate compensation for employers faced with frivolous cases, but I've spent nearly 30 years doing employment cases and I just do not believe there are many frivolous ones. The fact that many cases are withdrawn before hearing is because settlement is often reached, frequently when the employer agrees to pay because the employee's case is strong. And the disruption caused by claims against employers is nowhere near comparable to the distress caused to employees who are unfairly treated. </p> <p>I don't understand your figure of \u00a37.5bn as the cost of the \"compensation culture\". Compensation is only payable when someone has broken the law; if you break the law and someone else suffers loss, or is injured, why shouldn't you pay compensation? I find it hard to believe that the NHS, emergency services and local government have paid out \u00a34bn in compensation and costs for their own wrongdoing. Maybe you are referring to the cost of attending to accidents in which compensation has later been recovered by victims; if so, I agree that the wrongdoer should compensate those bodies too. </p> <p>In 1994, the health and safety executive estimated that the net cost to individuals of work-related accidents and ill-health was \u00a35bn; the cost to employers \u00a31.5bn. The cost to society was between \u00a311bn and \u00a316bn. It would be much better economics for employers to comply with law than to whinge about frivolous tribunal cases. Many lawyers take many deserving cases in tribunals and courts free of charge, but you can't expect them to run their businesses at a loss. Wasn't your starting point the need to protect small businesses from irrecoverable costs? </p> <p>Yours, </p> <p>John </p> <p>Join the debate at <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/debate/\">www.newsunlimited.co.uk/debate/</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Oh my God. Oh. My. God. <strong> Friends</strong> is back on Sky 1, and the only thing that has changed is that David Schwimmer's goo-goo eyes have got even more goo-goo. When Ross pouts at Rachel, why doesn't she just sock him on the jaw and then kick him repeatedly when he's down? Why? </p> <p>Don't tell me women don't do that kind of thing. They do on US TV. And it can only be a matter of time before they do it here, though probably not on Hetty Wainthropp Investigates. In the new <strong> ER</strong> (Sky 1), for instance, some guy triggers the fire alarm just because he can't get any treatment for his palpitating bonce and gets thumped as a result. The irresponsibility! The white coats are flapping around trying to deal with the carnage after a truck collides with a gourmet coffee shop and he's worried about a headache! </p> <p>The cafe crash had indeed produced some horrible injuries: \"What's that burn look like to you, Dr Benton?\" \"Er, that's a double double mocha burn, Dr Ramano.\" \"Lucky I'm here then isn't it, Peter? That's a skinny vanilla latte burn. Nurse, prep him. We're going inside. Now, cue up some fast-paced house music while I make the incision.\" This is the kind of dialogue they never have in ER, but I'm quite prepared to write more along these lines for the right fee. Quite prepared. </p> <p>So the woman nurse flattened the guy who nixed the fire alarm. No matter that he was built like Beachy Head and she like a Princess Di figurine. This confirms two things: one, that in ER the medical profession are gods, and that mortals should delay them never; two, that it's OK, perhaps even empowering and sexy, for women to hit men on TV. </p> <p>And during the pilot for <strong> The West Wing</strong> (Sky 1), a drama series set in the White House, Mandy, a senator's assistant and full-on hardass (I don't really know what this amounts to in practical life, but I won't be inviting her round for tea and pressing her to a cucumber sandwich any time soon), said to a former lover: \"I want you at your fighting weight when I start bitch-slapping you around the Beltway.\" </p> <p>Bitch-slapping. That's no way to carry on. When women fought in the bar of Cheers (as often as not over Sam Malone's cunningly combed piece ), Norm would attract Cliff's attention with an excitable \"Cat fight! Cat fight!\" Cliff, wiping froth from his moustache, would assess the situation more coolly. \"Kitten fight,\" he would say, before returning to his beer. Men love to see women fighting - it comes second only to lesbian sex scenes in the canon of the male heterosexual's voyeuristic delights. Bitch slapping, I fear, will never have such appeal. </p> <p>American men run in terror of symbolic castration. In The West Wing, for instance, when Mandy told Josh that she was dating her senator boss, he immediately had to claim his rival was gay. \"He's very athletic. Plenty masculine,\" retorted Mandy, plenty defensively. \"I think he's a woman,\" said Josh, mucho aggressively. </p> <p>The West Wing promises much, particularly from its writing. The press corps stood waiting for a briefing to begin: \"They're holding four column inches above the fold,\" said one. \"They're going to be wrong,\" sneered another. I, as you can see, don't get out of bed for four inches above or below the fold, no doubt because I too fear symbolic castration. The West Wing is every bit as well-written and morally engaging as LA Law or Murder One. </p> <p>I'll be returning to it in future weeks. And to Friends, too, since the latest series is the culmination of a journey from sitcom to unwitting dramatic critique of celebrity incestuousness. No one was good enough for the Friends to have relationships with except the Friends themselves. In the new series, the writers have taken this truth to its conclusion: Ross and Rachel are married; Monica and Chandler have plighted something. It only remains for Phoebe to plump Joey's barrel chest seductively for the unwholesome sixsome to be conjugally felicitated. As if to confirm that life imitates art, the actors who play Ross and Monica (brother and sister in the series) have wedded. \"For Courteney and David, who did get married,\" read the caption at the end. For one horrible moment I thought it was to each other. Oh my God. Oh. My. God.</p>",

In the new ER (Sky 1), for instance, some guy triggers the fire alarm just because he can't get any treatment for his palpitating bonce and gets thumped as a result. The irresponsibility! The white coats are flapping around trying to deal with the carnage after a truck collides with a gourmet coffee shop and he's worried about a headache! The cafe crash had indeed produced some horrible injuries: \"What's that burn look like to you, Dr Benton?\" \"Er, that's a double double mocha burn, Dr Ramano.\" \"Lucky I'm here then isn't it, Peter? That's a skinny vanilla latte burn. Nurse, prep him. We're going inside. Now, cue up some fast-paced house music while I make the incision.\" This is the kind of dialogue they never have in ER, but I'm quite prepared to write more along these lines for the right fee. Quite prepared. So the woman nurse flattened the guy who nixed the fire alarm. No matter that he was built like Beachy Head and she like a Princess Di figurine. This confirms two things: one, that in ER the medical profession are gods, and that mortals should delay them never; two, that it's OK, perhaps even empowering and sexy, for women to hit men on TV. And during the pilot for The West Wing (Sky 1), a drama series set in the White House, Mandy, a senator's assistant and full-on hardass (I don't really know what this amounts to in practical life, but I won't be inviting her round for tea and pressing her to a cucumber sandwich any time soon), said to a former lover: \"I want you at your fighting weight when I start bitch-slapping you around the Beltway.\" Bitch-slapping. That's no way to carry on. When women fought in the bar of Cheers (as often as not over Sam Malone's cunningly combed piece ), Norm would attract Cliff's attention with an excitable \"Cat fight! Cat fight!\" Cliff, wiping froth from his moustache, would assess the situation more coolly. \"Kitten fight,\" he would say, before returning to his beer. Men love to see women fighting - it comes second only to lesbian sex scenes in the canon of the male heterosexual's voyeuristic delights. Bitch slapping, I fear, will never have such appeal. American men run in terror of symbolic castration. In The West Wing, for instance, when Mandy told Josh that she was dating her senator boss, he immediately had to claim his rival was gay. \"He's very athletic. Plenty masculine,\" retorted Mandy, plenty defensively. \"I think he's a woman,\" said Josh, mucho aggressively. The West Wing promises much, particularly from its writing. The press corps stood waiting for a briefing to begin: \"They're holding four column inches above the fold,\" said one. \"They're going to be wrong,\" sneered another. I, as you can see, don't get out of bed for four inches above or below the fold, no doubt because I too fear symbolic castration. The West Wing is every bit as well-written and morally engaging as LA Law or Murder One. I'll be returning to it in future weeks. And to Friends, too, since the latest series is the culmination of a journey from sitcom to unwitting dramatic critique of celebrity incestuousness. No one was good enough for the Friends to have relationships with except the Friends themselves. In the new series, the writers have taken this truth to its conclusion: Ross and Rachel are married; Monica and Chandler have plighted something. It only remains for Phoebe to plump Joey's barrel chest seductively for the unwholesome sixsome to be conjugally felicitated. As if to confirm that life imitates art, the actors who play Ross and Monica (brother and sister in the series) have wedded. \"For Courteney and David, who did get married,\" read the caption at the end. For one horrible moment I thought it was to each other. Oh my God. Oh. My. God.",

Now the RA has grabbed the trophies back and forced the best to smile politely at the worst in a ceremony where everyone gets an award. </p> <p>You can almost feel C\u00e9zanne grit his teeth as he watches the award for Most Kinky Painting of Bathers go to mediocre British artist (and Royal Academician) Henry Scott Tuke, who specialised in painting naked young men in ways that were innocent to the untutored, more suggestive to the initiated, and, to us, are entertainingly erotic. Ho ho ho, we chuckle, and walk past a small, obscure painting of bodies glimpsed through a pixillated visual field by C\u00e9zanne. </p> <p>The only reassuring thing about an event like the Oscars, or any institutional event that glorifies mediocrities and ignores the brilliant subversives, is that it doesn't really matter. The only judge of art is time. But what happens if we go back in time, in an art nouveau time machine, to the official salon art of 1900? This is what the RA has done with 1900: Art at the Crossroads - a partial reconstruction of the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in the spring and summer of 1900. This was a huge event celebrating electricity, empire and art nouveau, but the part of the Exposition that the RA is interested in is the international exhibition of painting and sculpture. The exhibition did not include any of the modernist artists at work in the city, though a separate show of impressionism was held in a centennial exhibition of French art. This \"official\" painting was the last gasp of 19th-century naturalism and romanticism, a hypocritical, conservative art of harems and sentimentalised workers. These painters did all they could to keep the modernist upstarts down. </p> <p>Now they're back, their paintings retrieved from cellars all over the world. No one could bear an undiluted show of conservative official art from 1900 though, so the RA has displayed a selection of Exposition Universelle paintings alongside work by their modernist contemporaries. The curators claim it will make us see the art of 1900 in a new way, and so it does. </p> <p>It must have taken a real effort for the curators to persuade themselves that these Modern masters were really not that special - that when you look at C\u00e9zanne, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, Matisse and the teenage Picasso next to the bloated establishment artists of the late 19th century what you see are equally valid ways of making art. </p> <p>If the Exposition Universelle sanctified the fin-de-si\u00e8cle establishment, this exhibition is the reductio ad absurdum of deconstructive art history. Since the 80s art historians have been chipping away at the canon of Modern art. You can see this as necessarily subversive and disruptive, but there are limits. \"Are there ways of seeing oil-and-water contemporaries like Bouguereau and C\u00e9zanne that might bridge the gap between them?\" asks art historian and co-curator Robert Rosenblum in his catalogue essay. Only if you look through academic glasses that stop you seeing what's in front of your eyes. Bouguereau's paintings, which had pride of place in the Exposition Universelle, are enjoyed today as greeting-card images. At the RA you can smile at his Admiration (1897), a coy soft-porn painting of nymphs with semi-revealed breasts around a wicked little cupid. Ugh. </p> <p>And then look at C\u00e9zanne, Degas, Munch, Rodin, Gauguin, Matisse and Klimt - who showed the one great modernist painting that slipped into the Exposition, his dionysian Pallas Athene - and you're in another world. Our world. Bouguereau belongs to a weird, fruity past. The modernists of 1900 belong to our time. The historian of science Thomas Kuhn argues that revolutions in knowledge are not evolutionary but seismic - and that's how modernism looks in this exhibition. Because perversely, this is a great celebration of Modern art. By forcing Modern masters to share wall space with the likes of Alma-Tadema, it does modernism an accidental favour. The Modern masterpieces - about 50 paintings out of 250 in the exhibition - are like oases in the desert. Content, narrative, genre - these are the props they kick away. It doesn't matter whether Munch is painting a portrait or a landscape; what you get is his visionary shattering of the world. When you see Degas's bronze of a woman drying herself in the bath, the beautiful awk wardness of it, the bath as a clumsy physical presence, breaks out of the elegant fin-de-si\u00e8cle into a brutal modernist physicality. </p> <p>Did the artists in this exhibition see themselves at a \"crossroads\", able to choose between what co-curator MaryAnne Stevens calls \"options\"? I doubt if any good artist ever sees art as a matters of options. In any case, the crossroads had been passed back in the middle of the 19th century. The modern world was up and running in 1900, cities exploding, anarchists throwing bombs, middle-class culture disintegrating. When the official artists of 1900 painted society portraits and cloying religious scenes (check out Bouguereau's Regina Angelorum, 1900) they were reasserting the order of things against revolution. </p> <p>The Modern artists were single-minded about the revolution they were making. They had a world to imagine, as you see from their hyper-intense, troubled self-portraits - Matisse in colours of his mind; the German expressionist Emil Nolde disappearing in darkness. The terrible thing about this exhibition is that lots of people will enjoy it. It's amusing and easy to look at Bouguereau. It's hard to look at C\u00e9zanne. But it's not the art of 1900 that is being judged here, it's us. The desire to muddy the waters of art history, to level the Modern masters with mediocre contemporaries, suggests an anxiety about our own time. We have plenty of good, interesting artists. But how do we compare with 1900? How do we compare with Picasso, Matisse, C\u00e9zanne, Degas? I suppose it's tempting to knock when you're scared you can't measure up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alfred Nzo, who has died aged 74, was a veteran of the African National Congress. He had impeccable struggle credentials, starting as a 20-year-old member of the militant new ANC Youth League (founded by Nelson Mandela and others) and serving as ANC secretary-general from 1969-91; but he never had star quality, he was solid rather than sparkling. He was one of a family of five children, from Benoni, east Witwatersrand, where his father was a clerical worker for a gold mine. He went through the (officially-suspect) missionary education in the eastern Cape (certificate at Catholic school, matriculation at Healdtown missionary institute), before enrolling at that breeding ground for black activists, Fort Hare university college, where he dropped out in 1946, in his second year of a science degree. Nzo was such a low-profile figure that in his (not very scholarly) history of the ANC, Francis Meli scarcely mentions him. Yet without Nzo to do the spade work, the ANC, struggling to resist apartheid, would not have notched up early spectacular strikes and boycotts. Nzo concentrated his activities on Alexandra township, north of Johannesburg, becoming secretary of the bus boycott, which lasted from January to March 1957 and shook the city's white establishment.

Both are likely to appeal against any ruling. If so, the final act of this case could still be a long way off.</p>",

Although the case is seen as a landmark in the internet age, the legal action has its roots in an investigation by the federal trade commission in 1991, years before the significance of the internet was realised. The commission began investigating after rivals complained that Microsoft was using its stranglehold on world operating systems to shut them out of the software market. The investigation resulted in Microsoft signing a so-called consent decree for the government in 1995. This narrowly focused document tried to stop the company using its licensing agreements to bully computer manufacturers, but two years later, the justice department charged Microsoft with violating the decree. The company's relationship with the regulatory authorities has been increasingly acrimonious ever since. When Netscape, the upstart web browser company, wrote to the trustbusters complaining about Microsoft, government lawyers again found Microsoft unyielding - setting the tone of legal battles that followed the decision to prosecute in 1998. Unless Bill Gates's new job really does lead to a different stance, few observers believe the two sides will be able to reach a settlement. Both are likely to appeal against any ruling. If so, the final act of this case could still be a long way off.",

      "body": "<p>For two weeks they had been living on a diet of rotting vegetables, using a bucket as a lavatory and lying entombed in vomit in the darkness of a ship's container as they set sail for the brave new world. And for three seekers of the American dream, the result this week was a slow and painful death on the high seas.</p> <p>China may have got the green light to join the World Trade Organisation to secure a larger market for their goods but, for the past two months, its most publicised export to the west has been human beings.</p> <p>Immigration officials on the North American coast from Long Beach, California, to Vancouver, Canada, have been stunned by the extent of the recent human smuggling explosion. In the past two months, they have seized eight container-loads of Chinese stowaways, including the tragic cargo on board the Cape May at Seattle this week. Between 4,000 and 5,000 Chinese are now attempting to enter the US illegally every year.</p> <p>\"They have an image of America, of the American dream,\" said Anna Ip of China Outreach in Los Angeles. \"They have heard that everything is so good, everyone is so well off. But they only have half the picture.\"</p> <p>Many of the would-be immigrants, she said, had little idea of what awaited them when they signed on with the smugglers in their home province of Fujian, on the south coast of China.</p> <p>The stowaways from Fujian believe in the popular local saying that \"one person goes abroad; the whole family makes money\".</p> <p><b> Tales of untold wealth</b></p> <p>The \"snakeheads\" who organise the trips beguile them with stories of untold wealth in the US. And in Fujian's villages they can see the evidence: families with a member abroad have tiled balconies, walled patios and satellite television, those who do not often live in relative squalor.</p> <p>The stowaways will pay around 6,000 renminbi (\u00a3440), a year's wages, as a down payment and will agree to pay back a further fee of between $30,000 to $60,000 in indentured labour on their arrival.</p> <p>\"Those who organise for them to come over get them to work in sweatshops to pay off those fees,\" said Ms Ip. She said that even when they have paid off their fare, stowaways face problems finding legal work. \"They may try to get a fake green card from downtown or work in restaurants as black market labour,\" she said.</p> <p>Rumours sweep the villages about the best destinations. There was a brief vogue for Guam as a good stepping stone to the US and currently there is the belief that Australia would be a good choice because it is thought everyone is guaranteed a job at this year's Sydney Olympics.</p> <p>Last week, Xinhua, China's official news agency, reported the repatriation of 246 stowaways from the US to Fujian's provincial capital, Fuzhou, but there has been little coverage of the human interest side of the story, merely reports of tough actions taken against would-be migrants.</p> <p><b> Increased penalties</b></p> <p>China's public security ministry said that 2,975 defectors had been arrested attempting to leave the mainland in the first four months of last year. An increase in penalties for such attempts has also been announced and official slogans painted on the walls call on local authorities to \"crack down on illegal emigration\".</p> <p>The three deaths on the Cape May are the first the US immigration and naturalisation nervice (INS) knows of, but it accepts that others may have happened; the traffic shows little sign of abating.</p> <p>The day after the fatal discovery, 19 more young men were found aboard the Hanjin Yokohama, which had sailed, as the Cape May had, from Hong Kong.</p> <p>The conditions for the journey vary. The 18 Cape May stowaways - 15 survivors are being treated in Seattle - shared a space 12 metres (40ft) long by 2 metres (7ft) wide, and their only light came from torches.</p> <p>The three who died are thought to have perished at least three days before they reached the shore, probably from dehydration.

      "bodyText": "For two weeks they had been living on a diet of rotting vegetables, using a bucket as a lavatory and lying entombed in vomit in the darkness of a ship's container as they set sail for the brave new world. And for three seekers of the American dream, the result this week was a slow and painful death on the high seas. China may have got the green light to join the World Trade Organisation to secure a larger market for their goods but, for the past two months, its most publicised export to the west has been human beings. Immigration officials on the North American coast from Long Beach, California, to Vancouver, Canada, have been stunned by the extent of the recent human smuggling explosion. In the past two months, they have seized eight container-loads of Chinese stowaways, including the tragic cargo on board the Cape May at Seattle this week. Between 4,000 and 5,000 Chinese are now attempting to enter the US illegally every year. \"They have an image of America, of the American dream,\" said Anna Ip of China Outreach in Los Angeles. \"They have heard that everything is so good, everyone is so well off. But they only have half the picture.\" Many of the would-be immigrants, she said, had little idea of what awaited them when they signed on with the smugglers in their home province of Fujian, on the south coast of China. The stowaways from Fujian believe in the popular local saying that \"one person goes abroad; the whole family makes money\". Tales of untold wealth The \"snakeheads\" who organise the trips beguile them with stories of untold wealth in the US. And in Fujian's villages they can see the evidence: families with a member abroad have tiled balconies, walled patios and satellite television, those who do not often live in relative squalor. The stowaways will pay around 6,000 renminbi (\u00a3440), a year's wages, as a down payment and will agree to pay back a further fee of between $30,000 to $60,000 in indentured labour on their arrival. \"Those who organise for them to come over get them to work in sweatshops to pay off those fees,\" said Ms Ip. She said that even when they have paid off their fare, stowaways face problems finding legal work. \"They may try to get a fake green card from downtown or work in restaurants as black market labour,\" she said. Rumours sweep the villages about the best destinations. There was a brief vogue for Guam as a good stepping stone to the US and currently there is the belief that Australia would be a good choice because it is thought everyone is guaranteed a job at this year's Sydney Olympics. Last week, Xinhua, China's official news agency, reported the repatriation of 246 stowaways from the US to Fujian's provincial capital, Fuzhou, but there has been little coverage of the human interest side of the story, merely reports of tough actions taken against would-be migrants. Increased penalties China's public security ministry said that 2,975 defectors had been arrested attempting to leave the mainland in the first four months of last year. An increase in penalties for such attempts has also been announced and official slogans painted on the walls call on local authorities to \"crack down on illegal emigration\". The three deaths on the Cape May are the first the US immigration and naturalisation nervice (INS) knows of, but it accepts that others may have happened; the traffic shows little sign of abating. The day after the fatal discovery, 19 more young men were found aboard the Hanjin Yokohama, which had sailed, as the Cape May had, from Hong Kong. The conditions for the journey vary. The 18 Cape May stowaways - 15 survivors are being treated in Seattle - shared a space 12 metres (40ft) long by 2 metres (7ft) wide, and their only light came from torches. The three who died are thought to have perished at least three days before they reached the shore, probably from dehydration. They had to wait for a number of days before being loaded on to the ship that left Hong Kong, and endured a very rough crossing during which many of them vomited frequently. This would have made them more vulnerable to dehydration when their water ran out. Some containers have holes punched in their tarpaulin tops for air and may even have furniture and lighting, but immigration officials are on the lookout. Virginia Kice of the INS said that the first discovery of a container smuggling humans was in April 1998 and there has been a steady increase since. She said that pictures of stowaways arriving neatly dressed and with mobile phones were misleading: \"The ones who died were in a container under four others. They were virtually entombed.\" Immigration officials who had received a tip-off from Hong Kong had to shift 35 containers to find the Cape May stowaways. Some freighters can carry as many as 5,000 containers, making the search for human beings almost impossible even with the use of well-trained sniffer dogs. Those fortunate enough to reach the US shore are entitled to an asylum hearing. \"Many of them have been coached and they know the kind of things to say,\" said Ms Kice. \"But we want to err on the side of caution because we have a human rights tradition in this country.\" The Hong Kong government has promised to try to crack down on the human smuggling trade. They have tipped off immigration officials in the US and Canada when they have information of container-loads of stowaways, although the amount of container traffic from the port is enormous: around 15m containers moved over its cranes last year. Yesterday, under the afternoon sun in Long Beach, hundreds of containers from China were being unloaded. Near by, as if as a reminder to aspiring stowaways, is Terminal Island, where illegal immigrants are held when they are caught. Immigration officials are on high alert now for the new cargo and 143 have been found in the past year at the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles. However, some arrivals from China will always be welcome. Legislation passed in 1991 granted legal immigrants status to any foreigner prepared to invest $1m in a business that would create full-time jobs, and hundreds of Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong have taken advantage of this. However, their arrival tends to be in a first-class cabin rather than lying starving in darkness beside a dying friend.",

      "bodyText": "Evidence of direct Belgian government complicity in the execution of the Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba must be made public and those implicated questioned, a historian demanded yesterday. Lugo de Witte, a Flemish expert on Africa, called for a parliamentary commission of inquiry to hear testimony under oath from former officials involved in the 1961 killing of one of Africa's most charismatic post-colonial leaders. His 400-page book, just published in French, throws new light on one of the darkest chapters in Belgium's long and rapacious relationship with Congo, and establishes clear state responsibility for a brutal political murder. Lumumba - popular, articulate and a hero of the anti-colonial struggle - was just 36 when he became the first prime minister of the inde pendent Congo in June 1960. But within a month a civil war erupted, provoked by the attempted secession of the copper-rich Katanga province, led by Moise Tshombe. Tshombe recruited Belgian, French and South African mercenaries to fight the government. United Nations forces intervened in the biggest peacekeeping operation the UN had mounted since being founded, but they did little more than maintain the status quo. Lumumba was deposed and an unknown colonel called Joseph-Desire Mobutu took control of country, which he renamed Zaire, and remained a faithful friend of the west until his overthrow in May 1997. The United States saw the militant nationalist Lumumba as a communist sympathiser; CIA involvement in plans to kill him has been long established by senate hearings and declassified documents. But Mr De Witte's research showed that by the time Lumumba was killed Washington had little ability to operate on the ground in Congo and had given way to Brussels. \"Belgian officers had direct resposibility for his assassination,\" he insisted yesterday. A document signed by the then Belgian minister for Africa, Harold Aspremont Lynden, in October 1960, said explicitly: \"The main objective to pursue, in the interests of the Congo, Katanga and Belgium, is clearly the final elimination of Lumumba.\" On January 17 1961, Lumumba, under arrest by Mobutu's forces, was transferred to Katanga on a Sabena plane on the orders of Aspremont Lynden and the Belgian foreign minister, Pierre Wigny.

On the run for more than a year, charged along with her manager, Sergio Andrade, of corrupting young girls as part of an itinerant sex cult, the couple were arrested with another woman, Maria Portillo, in the Rio flat late on Thursday. Trevi, known as the \"Mexican Madonna\" for her sexually provocative stage persona, disappeared in 1998 shortly before allegations surfaced that, along with Andrade, she kidnapped and sexually enslaved young singers. Interpol last year issued an international search warrant, which raised the stakes in a scandal that had burned hot for months in Central America, exposing a darker side of the Latin entertainment industry. Trevi, Andrade and Portillo are being held in custody as Mexico begins extradition proceedings against them for the corruption of minors, aggravated rape and kidnapping. The three deny the charges. Brazilian police said they were asked by Mexico to investigate the singer when The Guardian published a story in September last year that she might have fled to Brazil.

From all the information I gathered it was a [drug] peddler,\" said Carlos Alvarez, a cardiologist. The intruder escaped after being discovered by staff at the Sacred Heart clinic in Buenos Aires, where Maradona, 39, has been convalescing after collapsing in Uruguay 10 days ago, suffering from hypertension and an irregular heart beat. \"His sickness is caused by cocaine. This is like giving kilos of salt to a hypertense person so he has a cardiovascular attack,\" said Mr Alvarez. This week doctors said the Argentine star, an admitted cocaine addict, had flirted with death by taking such a quantity of drugs that his heart rate was reduced to 38% of capacity. The unmasking of the drug dealer had prompted a decision to tighten security around Maradona by transferring him to a neuropsychiatric institute \"as soon as possible\".

      "bodyText": "In the wake of the deadly floods and mudslides that rocked Venezuela last month, human rights groups have now uncovered a series of executions and beatings allegedly carried out by the Venezuelan military in an attempt to stop widespread looting. Eyewitness reports from the coastal state of Vargas have been compiled by human rights groups and investigators for the Venezuelan government are now reluctantly conceding that about 60 people were killed between December 17 and 30. According to the reports, the majority of the murders were carried out with rifles equipped with silencers, or with blunt instruments. The use of blunt instruments is thought to have allowed the corpses to mix with the mass of mangled bodies created by the worst natural disaster in Venezuelan history. Roger Cedeno, the state ombudsman, told a news agency: \"Since December 17, we have received estimates that more than 60 people died in mass executions.\" He said that various branches of the armed forces were involved in \"grave excesses\", and added that \"the worst were committed by the army's soldiers\". The issue is particularly delicate as the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, a former paratrooper who has been involved in more than one military uprising, is reluctant to criticise any of his former colleagues. When the respected Venezuelan human rights group, Provea (Venezuelan Programme for Action on Human Rights), first made the allegations in early January, Mr Chavez lambasted the group as \"irresponsible and superficial\". Since then, however, Mr Chavez has been forced to back down, especially after the Catholic church weighed in with the opinion that Provea was a \"credible organisation\" and called for an investigation of the charges. The foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, later conceded: \"I think [Provea's charges] should be investigated - if there are human rights violations, they should be punished with the full weight of the law.\" General Francisco Rangel, Mr Chavez's chief of staff, met human rights groups at the presidential palace on Monday and, in a token gesture, the Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional reported this week that Mr Chavez had expelled three soldiers from the national guard on charges that they had participated, not in executions, but looting. \"I will not lower my head\" before the human rights issues, Mr Chavez said, while still insisting that thus far there was \"nothing that can be considered proof\" of the military's involvement in the alleged executions. It is estimated that 10,000 to 20,000 people died in last month's torrential rains and the subsequent mudslides that devastated the capital Caracas and Vargas state, the regions worst hit by the floods.",

      "body": "<p>It began in a northern seaside town, with a young entrepreneur, a \u00a31,000 overdraft and a man making motorcycle sidecars. Today it is Formula One racing, has a showcase in Detroit in the heartland of the global automotive industry and an ambition to turn out 200,000 cars a year. Oh, and there is the small matter of its own woodland of walnut trees in the new National Forest in the Midlands. </p> <p>Roll out Jaguar - long a by-word for British engineering chic, now owned by a company whose founder once said his customers could have any colour of car they wanted - provided it was black. </p> <p>But back to Blackpool, famous for its tower but also rather less well known as the starting place for the business career of a young man in a hurry. Indeed, William Lyons was in such a hurry that the Swallow Sidecar Company was formed on his 21st birthday. </p> <p>Swallow - Lyons in partnership with another William (Walmsley) - quickly took off. The break into the car business, however, had to wait until 1927 when another legend of the British motor industry, Herbert Austin, launched the Austin Seven, the baby Austin. </p> <p>In a move which foreshadowed today's industry obsession with more models on fewer platforms Lyons decided his firm could build a stylish two-seater body to sit on the Austin seven chassis. The resulting Austin Seven Swallow sold for \u00a3175 and or \u00a3185 for the hard-top version. </p> <p>Swallow quickly began fitting its tops to others bottoms, from the Morris Cowley to the Wolseley Hornet; then and soon moved to Coventry in the heartland of British motor manufacturing. </p> <p>Three years later, in 1931, Swallow took space at the London Motor Show to unveil the company's own car (albeit with a chassis built by the Standard Motor Company) to Swallow design - the SS1. It had a low slung look and long bonnet that characterised Lyons approach to design. Four years on, and a year after Walmsley had bowed out at Swallow - Lyons introduced a brand new four-door car and, reluctantly, he allowed himself to be persuaded by the com pany's advertising agency that it should be called the Jaguar. </p> <p>The rest, as they say, is history. The company emerged from the second world war with expertise in aeronautics, an understandable desire to drop the SS tag and not much by way of new model development. But within five years Jaguar - it was adopted as the corporate name in 1945 - was heading for Le Mans. In 1951 it clocked up the first of seven victories there. </p> <p> It was not until the start of the next decade, however, that Jaguar launched what is arguably its most famous model, the E-type, symbolic of the playboy end of the swinging sixties. </p> <p>Though the cars retained the trademark Jaguar look, behind the scenes times were changing. In 1966 Jaguar joined up with BMC and then with Leyland. By the end of 1968, Jaguar had become part of a group that included Austin, Daimler, MG, Riley, Rover, Triumph and Wolseley. </p> <p>The extended BL family arrangement was not an altogether happy experience. By the time Jaguar was floated on the stock market in 1984 it had already been operating semi-autonomously within BL for some time. Though the initial post-flotation period was promising, recession and a strong pound meant that by the end of the decade Jaguar was again looking for a partner. Ford, on the look-out for a top marque, fitted the bill. </p> <p>A decade on Jaguar is setting new sales records, joining Formula One where it will face old rivals like Ferrari and Mercedes, and is set to boost its model range, perhaps with its sporty F-type concept unveiled at Detroit this week and certainly with the X400, the so-called baby Jag which is due to be launched next year and which Jaguar hopes will spearhead the push to the 200,000 sales mark. It will cost more than the baby Austin. </p> <p>And the woodland? The company is spending \u00a3150,000 on the development of its bit of the 200 square mile national forest. A special variety - the Jaguar walnut is being developed - as the company, along with other car makers, seeks to demonstrate environmental credentials. And in a few years time it should have a handy supply of the raw material for its dashboards, too. </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jaguarcars.com/\">http://www.jaguarcars.com/</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ford.com/\">http://www.ford.com/</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It began in a northern seaside town, with a young entrepreneur, a \u00a31,000 overdraft and a man making motorcycle sidecars. Today it is Formula One racing, has a showcase in Detroit in the heartland of the global automotive industry and an ambition to turn out 200,000 cars a year. Oh, and there is the small matter of its own woodland of walnut trees in the new National Forest in the Midlands. Roll out Jaguar - long a by-word for British engineering chic, now owned by a company whose founder once said his customers could have any colour of car they wanted - provided it was black. But back to Blackpool, famous for its tower but also rather less well known as the starting place for the business career of a young man in a hurry. Indeed, William Lyons was in such a hurry that the Swallow Sidecar Company was formed on his 21st birthday. Swallow - Lyons in partnership with another William (Walmsley) - quickly took off. The break into the car business, however, had to wait until 1927 when another legend of the British motor industry, Herbert Austin, launched the Austin Seven, the baby Austin. In a move which foreshadowed today's industry obsession with more models on fewer platforms Lyons decided his firm could build a stylish two-seater body to sit on the Austin seven chassis. The resulting Austin Seven Swallow sold for \u00a3175 and or \u00a3185 for the hard-top version. Swallow quickly began fitting its tops to others bottoms, from the Morris Cowley to the Wolseley Hornet; then and soon moved to Coventry in the heartland of British motor manufacturing. Three years later, in 1931, Swallow took space at the London Motor Show to unveil the company's own car (albeit with a chassis built by the Standard Motor Company) to Swallow design - the SS1. It had a low slung look and long bonnet that characterised Lyons approach to design. Four years on, and a year after Walmsley had bowed out at Swallow - Lyons introduced a brand new four-door car and, reluctantly, he allowed himself to be persuaded by the com pany's advertising agency that it should be called the Jaguar. The rest, as they say, is history. The company emerged from the second world war with expertise in aeronautics, an understandable desire to drop the SS tag and not much by way of new model development. But within five years Jaguar - it was adopted as the corporate name in 1945 - was heading for Le Mans. In 1951 it clocked up the first of seven victories there. It was not until the start of the next decade, however, that Jaguar launched what is arguably its most famous model, the E-type, symbolic of the playboy end of the swinging sixties. Though the cars retained the trademark Jaguar look, behind the scenes times were changing. In 1966 Jaguar joined up with BMC and then with Leyland. By the end of 1968, Jaguar had become part of a group that included Austin, Daimler, MG, Riley, Rover, Triumph and Wolseley. The extended BL family arrangement was not an altogether happy experience. By the time Jaguar was floated on the stock market in 1984 it had already been operating semi-autonomously within BL for some time. Though the initial post-flotation period was promising, recession and a strong pound meant that by the end of the decade Jaguar was again looking for a partner. Ford, on the look-out for a top marque, fitted the bill. A decade on Jaguar is setting new sales records, joining Formula One where it will face old rivals like Ferrari and Mercedes, and is set to boost its model range, perhaps with its sporty F-type concept unveiled at Detroit this week and certainly with the X400, the so-called baby Jag which is due to be launched next year and which Jaguar hopes will spearhead the push to the 200,000 sales mark. It will cost more than the baby Austin. And the woodland? The company is spending \u00a3150,000 on the development of its bit of the 200 square mile national forest. A special variety - the Jaguar walnut is being developed - as the company, along with other car makers, seeks to demonstrate environmental credentials. And in a few years time it should have a handy supply of the raw material for its dashboards, too. Useful links http://www.jaguarcars.com/ http://www.ford.com/",

Mr Davis arrived at the Pru with a controversial background.

He left with what was then regarded as as record golden handshake in corporate UK of about \u00a32.8m. But his boardroom dust-up was a mere echo of an earlier fracas when he had failed to secure the top job at Sainsbury's where he had been an outstanding marketing director but the interests of the founding family meant no outsider was likely to secure the position of chief executive. Despite that boardroom setback - and Mr Davis's involvement in the decision to buy Shaw's in the US as well as establishing the DIY business Homebase in Britain - he and his wife are still dedicated shoppers at their local branch of Sainsbury's in Stevenage. A bon viveur as well as an opera and ballet fan, Mr Davis boasts an enviable track record in terms of share price performance. During the 10 years in which he was marketing director, Sainsbury's enjoyed a period of supremacy in the UK grocery sector; when he was running Reed Elsevier it became a global publishing force, although it probably failed to react adequately to the impact of the internet.

      "body": "<p>There is something sad about the fact that, when a man who has played a pivotal role in shaping the way the developed world lives and works announces he is hanging up his executive boots, the knee jerk response is \"oh, yeah?\" The immediate assumption is that Bill Gates' move from chief executive officer at Microsoft to the freshly-fashioned post of chief software architect has something to do with the anti-trust case and splitting the company into two or three, or the competi tive threat posed by the transposition of the internet into the wireless world, or both at the same time. The debate is about who or what this company is planning to crush, rather than the moment being used to reflect on what Mr Gates and his colleagues have created so far. </p> <p>So what is the man up to? There is no evidence that he is attempting to do anything out of the ordinary. Mr Gates wants to see off all possible threats to Microsoft's existing business and become a leader (or even dominate) every other sector it feels it can attack successfully. </p> <p>Leaving the anti-trust case aside, Microsoft is facing substantial competition, certainly the biggest threat since Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen created the Netscape web browser five years ago and added a fourth dimension to desktop computing. </p> <p>On that occasion Microsoft's response was two-pronged. On the one hand, Mr Gates moved back into the software lab and marshalled the creation of a rival product, Internet Explorer. And at the same time (it was alleged during the Department of Justice hearings) Microsoft executives flew down to see Netscape and threatened to flatten the company unless Microsoft was allowed to buy a piece of the action. </p> <p>So Mr Gates is now back in the lab to oversee what is being slated as Next Generation Windows Services. Microsoft is losing its grip in the operating system market and is also in serious danger of failing to get a handle on the computing at the heart of the new wave of mobile applications. It has to respond. </p> <p>Although, this time around, we can safely assume that the temptation to send corporate heavies simultaneously flying round the world threatening to flatten someone has been avoided. Microsoft is, after all, still awaiting sentencing at the hands of the American state. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the company does not want to be broken up and Steven Ballmer, Mr Gates's successor at the helm, is still labelling any attempt to do so as \"absolutely reckless and irresponsible\". But its attempts to avoid this have, to date, amounted to little more than a few bits of crass PR involving the Gates charitable foundation and a few software-tools-for-schools initiatives. </p> <p>Microsoft and its founder are missing the obvious trick. A break-up should be welcomed and willingly instigated by the company.

      "bodyText": "There is something sad about the fact that, when a man who has played a pivotal role in shaping the way the developed world lives and works announces he is hanging up his executive boots, the knee jerk response is \"oh, yeah?\" The immediate assumption is that Bill Gates' move from chief executive officer at Microsoft to the freshly-fashioned post of chief software architect has something to do with the anti-trust case and splitting the company into two or three, or the competi tive threat posed by the transposition of the internet into the wireless world, or both at the same time. The debate is about who or what this company is planning to crush, rather than the moment being used to reflect on what Mr Gates and his colleagues have created so far. So what is the man up to? There is no evidence that he is attempting to do anything out of the ordinary. Mr Gates wants to see off all possible threats to Microsoft's existing business and become a leader (or even dominate) every other sector it feels it can attack successfully. Leaving the anti-trust case aside, Microsoft is facing substantial competition, certainly the biggest threat since Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen created the Netscape web browser five years ago and added a fourth dimension to desktop computing. On that occasion Microsoft's response was two-pronged. On the one hand, Mr Gates moved back into the software lab and marshalled the creation of a rival product, Internet Explorer. And at the same time (it was alleged during the Department of Justice hearings) Microsoft executives flew down to see Netscape and threatened to flatten the company unless Microsoft was allowed to buy a piece of the action. So Mr Gates is now back in the lab to oversee what is being slated as Next Generation Windows Services. Microsoft is losing its grip in the operating system market and is also in serious danger of failing to get a handle on the computing at the heart of the new wave of mobile applications. It has to respond. Although, this time around, we can safely assume that the temptation to send corporate heavies simultaneously flying round the world threatening to flatten someone has been avoided. Microsoft is, after all, still awaiting sentencing at the hands of the American state. Unsurprisingly, the company does not want to be broken up and Steven Ballmer, Mr Gates's successor at the helm, is still labelling any attempt to do so as \"absolutely reckless and irresponsible\". But its attempts to avoid this have, to date, amounted to little more than a few bits of crass PR involving the Gates charitable foundation and a few software-tools-for-schools initiatives. Microsoft and its founder are missing the obvious trick. A break-up should be welcomed and willingly instigated by the company. Then Mr Gates really could step back into the lab and leave others to recount a great source of good. Touch of humour Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser at least managed to prove one point yesterday. Despite the imprudent comments made by Vodafone-AirTouch chief executive Chris Gent in a South African cricket commentary box over Christmas, he does have a sense of humour. Vodafone places much value on its global proposition but how valuable are Fiji, Malta or Uganda? he asked. Mannesmann would like to go to them for a holiday but would prefer to make money in Europe. Yet Mr Esser managed to prove very little else and the market is now almost treating this as a done deal. When Vodafone-AirTouch launched its bid for Mannesmann at the end of last year, the German company's shares were trading at a 26% discount to the offer price. Yesterday the differential was 9.6%, where it has been for a number of weeks. Much of the Mannesmann defence is based on distracting sideshows -whether they be fears of regulatory problems or arguments that Vodafone is two years behind with its internet strat egy. Mannesmann's mobile internet access is unlikely to launch before year end. As such, much comes down to who you choose to believe. Mr Esser argues that Mannesmann's growth will be 39% and combined with Vodafone will come down to 24%. As some of Mannesmann's fixed line businesses are immature the growth will be faster but it would seem unlikely that the core mobile phone divisions of both groups would be growing at substantially differing rates. The crux though is that Mr Esser again failed to address the longer term received wisdom of both the industry and investors that in telecoms and the internet scale is essential. Further down the line the likes of Vodafone and Mannesmann will not only face each other, but also the likes of AOL Time Warner as competition.",

The next biggest player is Novartis and Merck with 4.2%. A merged company would be on a par with Pfizer if it manages to scoop up Warner-Lambert. Although Sir Richard is expected to become chairman of the combined company in the short term, he is tipped to return to academic science shortly. That would leave Jean-Pierre Garnier at the helm with John Coombe and James Niedel as directors of finance and research. A history by prescription Glaxo was founded in 1873 as a general trading company in New Zealand by Joseph Nathan. Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Company was established in 1880 in London by two American pharmacists. In 1936 Sir Henry Wellcome left sole ownership of The Wellcome Foundation to a UK medical research charity, now called The Wellcome Trust. The two companies came together in 1995 when Glaxo took over Wellcome in a \u00a39bn deal. It currently employs 59,000 people worldwide, including 13,400 in the UK In 1998 it made pre-tax profits of \u00a32.67bn on sales of \u00a37.98bn. Its drugs include cold-sore treatment Zovirax, asthma drug Ventolin and Aids treatments Retrovir and Epivir . SmithKline Beecham's earnings growth has been better than GlaxoWellcome's since the original merger talks, partly thanks to the success of its new Avandia drug for diabetes. Its biggest business is prescription medicines, but the company also makes Panadol, and Aquafresh and Macleans toothpastes, and Nicorette anti-smoking patches In its last full year it made pre-tax profits of \u00a3902m against turnover of \u00a38bn. It employs 47,000 staff worldwide, with 8,200 workers in the UK at 10 sites.",

A borrower with a \u00a350,000 repayment loan will now pay an extra \u00a37.36 a month bringing the total up to \u00a3339.92, while an interest only borrower with the same size mortgage will suffer a \u00a39.79 increase to \u00a3272.21. </p> <p>Halifax followed swiftly with news that it will raise its rates from 7.24% to 7.49%. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which handles the mortgage busi ness for Lloyds TSB, the UK's third largest lender, will also lift rates by 0.25% to 7.49% But Northern Rock, another lender in the top ten by mortgage assets, bucked the trend by leaving mortgage rates pegged at 7.29%.Homebuyers suffered further misery yesterday as a top endowments company revealed sharply lower returns on its with-profits policies which back thousands of mortgages. </p> <p>And experts say there is worse to come with policy payouts likely to fall further over the next years - adding to the woes of endowment mortgage holders, many of whom have already been told to boost monthly premiums if their policies are to pay off their loans in full. The falls will impact on future pay-outs whose levels depend on present and past bonuses. </p> <p>Life insurer Norwich Union announced yesterday that it had cut bonus rates on with- profits policies for the fourth consecutive year. The downward moves echo Friends Provident's falling bonus rates announced earlier this week and are set to be followed by other big endowment names. </p> <p>Despite last year's big stockmarket advances, payments to holders of Norwich Union's maturing 25-year endowment policies - frequently used for home loan repayments - fell by 8.7%. A \u00a350-a-month policy taken out by a 29-year-old man in January 1975 is now worth \u00a389,518; a similar plan, started in 1974 and maturing 12 months ago, \u00a398,037. </p> <p>Holders of \u00a350-a-month ten- year endowments - often used for savings plans - saw their final payouts fall by 4.5% to \u00a39,479. The annual endowment bonus fell from 2% to 1.5% of the sum assured while the bonus paid on past bonuses dropped from 3.25% to 2.75%. Bonuses on newer style \"unitised\" with profits policies are also lower.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The largest mortgage lender and the largest building society were the first to inflict 0.25% increases on their standard variable mortgage rates yesterday, in line with this week's Bank of England base rate increase. Nationwide, the largest remaining building society, was first to announce an increase for mortgage customers to 6.95%, coupled with the same rise for holders of Nationwide savings accounts. A borrower with a \u00a350,000 repayment loan will now pay an extra \u00a37.36 a month bringing the total up to \u00a3339.92, while an interest only borrower with the same size mortgage will suffer a \u00a39.79 increase to \u00a3272.21. Halifax followed swiftly with news that it will raise its rates from 7.24% to 7.49%. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, which handles the mortgage busi ness for Lloyds TSB, the UK's third largest lender, will also lift rates by 0.25% to 7.49% But Northern Rock, another lender in the top ten by mortgage assets, bucked the trend by leaving mortgage rates pegged at 7.29%.Homebuyers suffered further misery yesterday as a top endowments company revealed sharply lower returns on its with-profits policies which back thousands of mortgages. And experts say there is worse to come with policy payouts likely to fall further over the next years - adding to the woes of endowment mortgage holders, many of whom have already been told to boost monthly premiums if their policies are to pay off their loans in full. The falls will impact on future pay-outs whose levels depend on present and past bonuses. Life insurer Norwich Union announced yesterday that it had cut bonus rates on with- profits policies for the fourth consecutive year. The downward moves echo Friends Provident's falling bonus rates announced earlier this week and are set to be followed by other big endowment names. Despite last year's big stockmarket advances, payments to holders of Norwich Union's maturing 25-year endowment policies - frequently used for home loan repayments - fell by 8.7%. A \u00a350-a-month policy taken out by a 29-year-old man in January 1975 is now worth \u00a389,518; a similar plan, started in 1974 and maturing 12 months ago, \u00a398,037. Holders of \u00a350-a-month ten- year endowments - often used for savings plans - saw their final payouts fall by 4.5% to \u00a39,479. The annual endowment bonus fell from 2% to 1.5% of the sum assured while the bonus paid on past bonuses dropped from 3.25% to 2.75%. Bonuses on newer style \"unitised\" with profits policies are also lower.",
