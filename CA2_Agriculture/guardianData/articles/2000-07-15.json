      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Mortgages that tie you down</strong> </p> <p>From fixed rates to capped and discounted rates, most attractive deals come with a price: you cannot ditch them in the first year or two without paying a hefty penalty. </p> <p>It may be reasonable to expect borrowers to be committed to a deal for as long as the favourable initial rate holds, but one that has you in chains for years after the offer finishes is a bad idea. </p> <p>The rate you have to pay after the honeymoon could well be 2 per cent higher than discounted deals then available. On a \u00a360,000 loan, this adds up to an extra \u00a31,200 a year in interest. </p> <p><strong> Poor-value annuities</strong> </p> <p>If you save in a personal pension, your provider will, when you retire, offer you an annuity - an income for life, that you buy with your fund. </p> <p>But independent financial advisers (IFAs) say this is unlikely to be the best value available. You have the right to shop around. </p> <p>Dan Kemp of IFA Holden Meehan says: 'The difference between the lowest rate and the highest is huge.' </p> <p><strong> Miserly current accounts</strong> </p> <p>Most traditional high street banks pay a pittance in interest on current account credit balances, even if they average more than \u00a31,500. Lloyds TSB and Barclays pay only 0.1 per cent, even on more than \u00a35,000. </p> <p>Internet users should consider switching to a web-based bank, such as Smile or Cahoot. These pay 4.85 per cent and 3 per cent respectively on current account balances from only \u00a31. Or you could use your present balance to save interest on your home loan by taking a current account mortgage, such as Virgin One. </p> <p><strong> Endowment mortgages</strong> </p> <p>These loans - now fading in popularity - use endowment policies to repay the loan, rather than the traditional repayment method. </p> <p>Endowments are inflexible and often perform poorly as investments. Many homebuyers taking endowment mortgage have recently been told that their investment may not pay off the amount they have borrowed. They have to make up the shortfall another way. </p> <p>Philippa Gee of independent financial adviser Gee and Company says: 'If you want to be sure your mortgage will be paid off at the end of the term, choose a repayment mortgage.' </p> <p><strong> Expensive store cards</strong> </p> <p>Department store account cards are tempting when you are paying for a big purchase. By opening one you often get a discount on that day's shopping bill. But if you go on using the card and pay off what you owe gradually, you will be charged very high interest rates. </p> <p>Annual rates for cards at Monsoon, Russell &amp; Bromley and Country Casuals are 30.7 per cent after 56 interest-free days. </p> <p>Using a lower-interest credit card is better. Egg, for example, charges 13.2 per cent, and the rate with Smile is 12.9 per cent. Better still, settle your balance monthly. </p> <p><strong> National Savings</strong> </p> <p>Savers pay for the rock-like safety of Government-backed National Savings products by accepting uncompetitive interest rates. </p> <p>Money in a National Savings Ordinary account, earns only 1.75 per cent. Legal &amp; General Bank pays 6.28 per cent on \u00a31 or more in its Tracker account. </p> <p><strong> Obsolete accounts</strong> </p> <p>For every new account paying interest of more than 6 per cent, there are others yielding less than 2 per cent, and occasionally half of that. </p> <p>In many cases these are obsolete accounts, which banks or building societies no longer offer to new customers. NatWest pays just 2.6 per cent on balances of less than \u00a310,000 in its First Reserve instant access account. Barclays' Instant Savings account pays as little as 1.25 per cent. </p> <p>Make regular checks on the interest paid on your savings, and change accounts if it falls significantly below the competition. </p> <p><strong> Unnecessary insurance</strong> </p> <p>Salesmen play on our fears, such as our children being left penniless if we died. People often succumb and buy insurance they do not need. </p> <p>Anyone who is single and has no one who would lose financially if they died is not likely to need life insurance. Yet a 19-year-old receptionist who was single and had no dependants was sold a policy when her main need was for a savings account. </p> <p>The Personal Investment Authority Ombudsman's office said: 'The initial sum insured of over \u00a312,000 was excessive...' It was supposed to pay possible funeral expenses set higher than even 'the wildest assumptions about inflation'. </p> <p>The watchdog ruled that her premiums should be returned with interest, plus \u00a3100 for distress and inconvenience. </p> <p>Bank staff, too, are now keen to sell their customers insurance. Remember, they are salespeople, and most no longer fit the old image of the paternalistic bank manager. </p> <p><strong> High-start pension fees</strong> </p> <p>Most personal pension firms are anticipating the launch next year of the Government-backed stakeholder schemes by offering similar plans themselves. Broadly, this means flexibility and charges no higher than 1 per cent a year. (See Money Writes, page 18). </p> <p>But many schemes still levy high charges in the early years. Ask what the transfer value of your pension would be in the first five years, and compare this with what you would have paid in contributions. If it is less, be cautious. </p> <p><strong> Notice accounts</strong> </p> <p>Savings accounts that tie up your money for a set period don't always pay extra. </p> <p>Fierce competition among instant access accounts means that some of the best rates are paid on accounts where you can get at your cash quickly. </p> <p>Financial database Moneyfacts says Bristol &amp; West pays 7.05 per cent on balances of more than \u00a310,000 in its 'save.it' internet account. </p> <p>This week, the best rate for the same amount in a notice account is also 7.05 per cent, with Scarborough building society. And for that you have to give 90 days' notice to get at your money. </p> <p><strong>Golden rules for your money</strong></p> <p> \u0095 Avoid high street banks; they rarely offer the best deals for current accounts, credit cards, savings or investments. The best current accounts are from converted building societies and new internet banks </p> <p>\u0095 Consider switching at least some of your borrowing and saving to a building society. These are generally better than the high street banks. </p> <p>\u0095 Keep investments separate from other financial needs. Products such as endowment mortgages - mixing investment with borrowing - are usually bettered by alternatives such as a cheap mortgage plus an Isa. </p> <p>\u0095 Borrow as sparingly as possible on credit cards. Sign up for a card with a low rate and pay it off as quickly as you can. Try not to run up a bill on the card again </p> <p>\u0095 Don't keep large amounts on deposit if you also have debts. You get high risk-free returns from paying off mortgage and credit card debt. Most people will need some money in a savings account, but it does not pay to keep accumulating cash deposits while you have debt. If you don't expect to have to touch your savings for five years, look at investing in the stock market through - in this order - Isas, unit or investment trusts, and shares. </p> <p>\u0095 Check in the financial press occasionally that your current account, credit cards and savings are competitive. </p> <p>\u0095 Get alternative quotes when renewing house and car insurance. Motor premiums are rising sharply, but the AA says it should still be possible to reduce premiums 30 per cent or so by shopping around. It may also be worth checking for a better deal on life insurance: premiums have dropped sharply in recent years; a contract taken out some time ago may now be expensive. Don't cancel a policy before confirming cover with a new insurer. </p> <p>\u0095 Be wary of products demanding long-term commitment. This may be a mortgage with redemption penalties that last beyond the discount or fixed rate, or a personal loan with repayment penalties. Endowment savings plans - similar to those used for mortgages but usually sold on a 10-year term - carry early cash-in penalties. You may not get back as much as you paid in the early years. </p> <p>\u0095 Beware borrowing to pay off debt. This can work if you are careful: a cheap introductory rate on a credit card to clear short-term debt, or a personal loan to cut the cost of assorted debts. But it can be a disaster if you add to the debt you have consolidated. Look first at whether you can budget your way out of debt. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are tempted by a new product aiming to revolutionise the way your organise your finances, ask yourself whether you could achieve the same result by taking a DIY approach. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember that you can't have your cake and eat it. For example, investment products that aim to give a stock market-linked return, but guarantee to pay back your original investment may work out a worse deal than if you simply kept some money on deposit and invested separately in shares.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you are thinking of buying an investment bond, you are most certainly not alone. Nearly 2 million people say they may buy one of these products in the next 12 months, according to researcher Mintel. </p> <p>You are likely to be over 45, and could well be newly retired, says Mintel in Bonds , a report published last week. You are probably a taxpayer, quite possibly at the higher rate. You have a lump sum to invest - perhaps redundancy money, an inheritance, or savings you want to work more effectively. You are prepared to take some risk with your investment return, but the security of your capital is very important to you. </p> <p>You are also twice as likely - according to the consumer research - to be married or cohabiting than living alone. </p> <p>Mintel believes demand for these bonds will grow as more people look for a relatively conservative investment vehicle combined with attractive tax benefits. Many people who buy them are transferring money from deposit accounts - tired of getting poor returns in our low interest-rate environment. </p> <p>Charles Levett-Scrivener of financial adviser Towry Law is a fan of these bonds in the right conditions. 'They have wide investment powers, so you can get a good degree of diversification even if you are just investing \u00a35,000. The companies also make it relatively easy for large investors to get enhanced terms, which is something you don't get on unit trusts, where the standard charges apply to everybody.' </p> <p>But if there is a fly in your ointment, it is the difficulty many have in understanding exactly what an investment bond is and how it works. </p> <p> <strong> Investment choices</strong> </p> <p> The most popular type of investment bond invests in an insurance company's with-profits fund. Although this type of fund is vulnerable to the fluctuating values of the assets it invests in - principally in the stock, fixed-interest and property markets - it uses a smooth ing effect to protect investors from fluctuations. Each year, the amount of your investment is increased as you receive your 'annual bonus'. </p> <p>A with-profits bond is safer than a unit-linked bond because you cannot lose the value of your annual bonus once it has been allocated to you. </p> <p>A with-profits bond can only ever increase in value, while a unit-linked bond can go up and down depending on the daily valuations of the assets it is invested in. </p> <p> Distribution bonds are aimed at cautious investors who want income on a regular basis. The insurers try hard to ensure that the capital value does not fall by taking a rather conservative investment strategy. </p> <p>Investors who want a predetermined return may prefer a guaranteed bond - either guaranteed equity or guaranteed income. This type of bond will typically guarantee you a fixed return on your capital if UK or other European stock markets rise by a given amount, stated by the insurer. Guaranteed income bonds are higher-risk. </p> <p> <strong> Tax</strong> </p> <p> An important reason for buying investment bonds is the beneficial tax treatment. If you are a basic-rate taxpayer and your withdrawals are less than 5 per cent of your original capital investment each year, you do not have to pay any tax on that income. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, income tax liability is capped at 18 per cent of the income - the difference between the 40 per cent higher rate and 22 per cent basic. This is because the insurance company is treated as the bond's owner, so it pays tax on income earned at the basic rate. </p> <p>Similarly, there is usually no personal liability to capital gains tax since the insurance company is seen as the fund owner and so discharges any CGT debts. (In some cases, however, there can be CGT - particularly with guaranteed equity bonds. Product innovation and rapid responses by the Inland Revenue have created a cat-and-mouse game on some tax liabilities.) </p> <p> <strong> Length of investment</strong> </p> <p> This depends on the type of bond you have invested in. Guaranteed bonds usually have a fixed term - you will either face hefty penalties if you withdraw money early or will simply be unable to access your cash. </p> <p>With all the other types of bond you should not consider investing unless you are prepared to leave your capital in place for at least five years, preferably longer. You may face exit penalties before the fifth anniversary. </p> <p>With-profits bond investors may also be subject to a 'market value adjustor', a downwards valuation, if they withdraw money after or during a market crash. </p> <p>\u0095 For a free copy of the 'Chartwell Guide to Distribution Bonds' phone 01225 321710 or write to Chartwell, 9 Kingsmead Square, Bath, BA1 2AB.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you are thinking of buying an investment bond, you are most certainly not alone. Nearly 2 million people say they may buy one of these products in the next 12 months, according to researcher Mintel. You are likely to be over 45, and could well be newly retired, says Mintel in Bonds , a report published last week. You are probably a taxpayer, quite possibly at the higher rate. You have a lump sum to invest - perhaps redundancy money, an inheritance, or savings you want to work more effectively. You are prepared to take some risk with your investment return, but the security of your capital is very important to you. You are also twice as likely - according to the consumer research - to be married or cohabiting than living alone. Mintel believes demand for these bonds will grow as more people look for a relatively conservative investment vehicle combined with attractive tax benefits. Many people who buy them are transferring money from deposit accounts - tired of getting poor returns in our low interest-rate environment. Charles Levett-Scrivener of financial adviser Towry Law is a fan of these bonds in the right conditions. 'They have wide investment powers, so you can get a good degree of diversification even if you are just investing \u00a35,000. The companies also make it relatively easy for large investors to get enhanced terms, which is something you don't get on unit trusts, where the standard charges apply to everybody.' But if there is a fly in your ointment, it is the difficulty many have in understanding exactly what an investment bond is and how it works. Investment choices The most popular type of investment bond invests in an insurance company's with-profits fund. Although this type of fund is vulnerable to the fluctuating values of the assets it invests in - principally in the stock, fixed-interest and property markets - it uses a smooth ing effect to protect investors from fluctuations. Each year, the amount of your investment is increased as you receive your 'annual bonus'. A with-profits bond is safer than a unit-linked bond because you cannot lose the value of your annual bonus once it has been allocated to you. A with-profits bond can only ever increase in value, while a unit-linked bond can go up and down depending on the daily valuations of the assets it is invested in. Distribution bonds are aimed at cautious investors who want income on a regular basis. The insurers try hard to ensure that the capital value does not fall by taking a rather conservative investment strategy. Investors who want a predetermined return may prefer a guaranteed bond - either guaranteed equity or guaranteed income. This type of bond will typically guarantee you a fixed return on your capital if UK or other European stock markets rise by a given amount, stated by the insurer. Guaranteed income bonds are higher-risk. Tax An important reason for buying investment bonds is the beneficial tax treatment. If you are a basic-rate taxpayer and your withdrawals are less than 5 per cent of your original capital investment each year, you do not have to pay any tax on that income. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, income tax liability is capped at 18 per cent of the income - the difference between the 40 per cent higher rate and 22 per cent basic. This is because the insurance company is treated as the bond's owner, so it pays tax on income earned at the basic rate. Similarly, there is usually no personal liability to capital gains tax since the insurance company is seen as the fund owner and so discharges any CGT debts. (In some cases, however, there can be CGT - particularly with guaranteed equity bonds. Product innovation and rapid responses by the Inland Revenue have created a cat-and-mouse game on some tax liabilities.) Length of investment This depends on the type of bond you have invested in. Guaranteed bonds usually have a fixed term - you will either face hefty penalties if you withdraw money early or will simply be unable to access your cash. With all the other types of bond you should not consider investing unless you are prepared to leave your capital in place for at least five years, preferably longer. You may face exit penalties before the fifth anniversary. With-profits bond investors may also be subject to a 'market value adjustor', a downwards valuation, if they withdraw money after or during a market crash. \u0095 For a free copy of the 'Chartwell Guide to Distribution Bonds' phone 01225 321710 or write to Chartwell, 9 Kingsmead Square, Bath, BA1 2AB.",

Without becoming an anorak on the subject, how can you avoid landing on an investment product that will blow up in your face? </p> <p>Ideally you should research every deal on the market to make sure you choose the best value. But if you can't choose the best, you can at least avoid the worst. In the past 10 years the financial services industry has made great strides in giving customers better value, with new products such as current account mortgages which let you offset savings and current account balances against mortgage borrowing, potentially saving you thousands in interest. And fierce competition in the savings market has spawned accounts that pay so much interest the institutions lose money on the deal. </p> <p>But venturing into an industry with a history of rip-offs and scandals is nerve-racking, and choosing a new mortgage or savings product lacks the excitement associated with buying a new car, CD player or wardrobe. If you do not want to adopt personal finance as a hobby, but have the uncomfortable feeling you could be doing better with your money, one way to approach the problem is to become aware of the types of products to avoid. You can also improve your prospects by occasionally checking that the financial products you have are still offering a reasonable deal. Financial institutions make millions through customer inertia. Once in an investment plan, or stuck in the slow process of paying off a mortgage, customers happily forget the whole thing. </p> <p>Despite the emergence of competitive products, many old-fashioned low-interest and inflexible deposit accounts still lurk in the shadows. Some even pay interest at below inflation, so in real terms your money is shrinking. Halifax has two accounts paying pitifully low rates. Its Card Cash account pays just 0.25 per cent, while the questionably named Liquid Gold account pays a maximum of 2.2 per cent, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. Who would let their cash languish in those accounts when at the same institution another instant access account pays 5 per cent? </p> <p>You might. Once savings are tucked away in a deposit account, it's tempting to put the passbook in a drawer and forget about the account until the money is needed. To make the most of your money it is vital to keep an eye on the rate of interest your account pays. Once an institution stops actively marketing a certain type of account, it often lets the rate fall behind the competition; instead it showers rewards on its latest savings head-turner. Dan Kemp of independent financial adviser Holden Meehan says many homeowners spend years paying their mortgage lenders interest at the standard variable rate, even though competitors offer discounted rates way below this. 'People get attracted to the lenders because of the rates in the first two or three years, and then they just stick around,' he says. 'Whenever a deal ends, be it fixed or discounted, people should always look at what others are prepared to lend them.' </p> <p>The perceived cost of shifting a mortgage to another lender might put you off, but a number of mortgage providers now offer to pay not only the legal expenses of the move but also the property valuation. This may mean no cost for you at all. </p> <p>It can be equally damaging to your wallet to choose a good-value product which happens to be unsuitable for you. Many people are sold life insurance when they have no dependants or anyone else who would suffer financially if they died. Or a self-employed person may take out payment protection insurance with a personal loan, even though the policy may cover employees only. </p> <p>Philippa Gee, independent financial adviser at Shrewsbury-based firm Gee &amp; Company, says: 'For someone who is willing to sacrifice higher rates of interest for security of capital, National Savings may be a suitable product, but for someone willing to take a bit more risk, it may not.

Lake says he is continually surprised at the number of poor investment decisions people make. These have included leaving large sums in low-earning accounts, or more than necessary on instant access, and failing to use available tax breaks. </p> <p>'Even if you leave all your money in high-earning accounts, over a long period they are a financial graveyard, because there can be no real income growth, no capital growth and no tax breaks to speak of.' He says people should be looking at stock market-based investments wherever possible. </p> <p>Simply taking advice is no guarantee that you will manage to avoid poor money deals. While a good independent financial adviser should always point you in the right direction, one who is too easily tempted by those products which pay high levels of commission to advisers may not. </p> <p>And many advisers, most notably bank and building society employees, are tied agents. They can only talk about or recommend products from a particular provider.

Instead, he would pretend the books already existed, and write fictions around them. As a cunning footnoted allusion in this novel to Borges's story \"Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote\" reveals, Mark Danielewski has stolen the idea and built an enormous, scholarly-gothic fiction around a non-existent film. </p> <p>The film, The Navidson Record, is a documentary made by Will Navidson, a photojournalist who has forsaken war zones in order to repair his marriage. Together with his wife Karen and their two children, Navidson moves into a pretty house in the country and sets up Hi-8 cameras in every room, thinking to make a homely family record. But everything is not as it seems. While working on the house one day, Navidson discovers that it measures three quarters of an inch longer on the inside than on the outside. </p> <p>Navidson calls friends and borrows tools to try to eliminate the illusion, but it persists. And then, between two adjoining rooms, there opens up an impossible 10-foot hallway, black and icy. There is something very wrong. The Navidson Record becomes a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 horror film as Will and his friends try to explore the anomalous space, which rearranges itself periodically with a roar, and expands into terrifying volumes of darkness. </p> <p>The main text of House of Leaves is written by an old man, Zampan\u00f2, who became obsessed with the film on its limited public release. As well as a long exegesis of the film's narrative, Zampan\u00f2 conducts a thorough synthesis of the mountain of scholarly and critical material that has grown up around the film, making use of published interviews with the surviving protagonists and carefully considering feminist, post-structuralist, Freudian, Jungian, deconstructionist and purely cin\u00e9aste-aesthetic readings of The Navidson Record.</p> <p>Danielewski thus weaves around his brutally efficient and genuinely chilling story a delightful and often very funny satire of academic criticism. In one way, and after the manner of Moby-Dick, the novel is its own Leviathan commentary (Danielewski even collects a Melvillean encyclopaedia of quotations about houses in one of the book's voluminous appendices). Every possible mythological and literary analysis of the story of Navidson's house is already provided in the text, but the house's impossibly vast, dark interior spaces, like the White Whale, finally shrug off all projected interpretation. Yet even that is not enough: Danielewski piles on even more narrative frames, ultimately to the novel's detriment. </p> <p>Writing footnotes to Zampan\u00f2's footnotes is a young apprentice LA tattooist called Johnny Truant, who finds the old man's box of papers after he dies and decides to turn them into a publishable book (occasionally Truant's own words are mediated through a final scholarly lens, that of \"The Editors\"). Truant notes the baffling fact that since Zampan\u00f2 (like Borges) was blind, he could never have seen The Navidson Record himself.</p> <p>But Truant himself is an unlikeable, feckless character: he continually interrupts the text to harangue us about his mad mother, his cloying love for a stripper called Thumper, and, since he began work on Zampan\u00f2's papers, his increasing, disabling fear - all in such a raggedly purple style that he quickly becomes very annoying. He is in the end one narrator too many. </p> <p>House of Leaves, even so, is a superbly inventive creation. It is not mere genre fiction, because the author so gleefully ignores the conventions of horror: no finally unmasked monster, no ghosts, no malign extraterrestrials. There is only the house. A diabolic architectural analogue of Borges's universal library, the house perturbs the reader's imagination because space - the dispensation of walls and floors, the certainty of relative topography - is normally the one thing we can rely on absolutely. The thousands of miles of pitchy corridors, vast vaulted caverns and spiral staircases opening up within the house are an affront not just to reason but to that pre-rational, hard-wired faith that enables us to move at all. Will Navidson eventually returns to the house because he has decided that it is God. </p> <p>In its meditation on the fragility of space the novel includes its own textual layout. A labyrinthine chapter prints boxed paragraphs extruded from other paragraphs, lists running backwards or upside down; at other times, the reader finds a series of pages with just one or two lines on them, and turns rapidly; at yet others, one is made to slow down by rotating the whole book at an angle. Every derangement of the page-space deftly mimes the current derangement of the house-space in the narrative.</p> <p>Further delicious textual mysteries include the fact that the word \"house\" itself, whether in English, German or French, is always printed in grey and baseline-shifted upwards, as if bashed out on a dodgy old typewriter; and that every reference to the myth of the Minotaur by Zampan\u00f2 has been violently struck through. </p> <p>It is not often that a reviewer devours a 700-page novel at one sitting; but I did, recklessly ignoring slimmer volumes that had more urgent claims upon my attention. House of Leaves is partly hobbled by the invasive, unconvincing voice of Johnny Truant, but it is nonetheless a rare debut: genuinely exciting in its technical and literary exuberance. If The Blair Witch Project were a true documentary, and there were a tireless new Borges around to analyse it, the result might be something like this deeply interesting book.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Rebellion</strong><br>Joseph Roth, translated by Michael Hofmann <br>(Granta, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502317267,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Congratulations to Granta, who have, with this, now made all Joseph Roth's completed novels available in English for the first time. Roth is one of those writers perhaps more heard of than read (his novel The Legend of the Holy Drinker was made into a fine film, starring Rutger Hauer, in 1988); now is your chance to catch up on him. </p> <p>This isn't a representative Roth novel, it has to be said. Roth - alcoholic yet industrious; journalist and novelist; a pacifist with a military bearing - was a bundle of contradictions at the best of times, not that there were, for him, many good times at all. Growing up poor, with no father, he was intelligent enough to be sceptical about the Austro-Hungarian Empire that nurtured him, yet at the same time under no illusions about any of the political alternatives that came to be offered after the first world war.</p> <p>As Michael Hofmann points out in his excellent introduction, he went to Soviet Russia in 1926 - two years after Rebellion - as an idealist and came back, as Walter Benjamin disappointedly noted, a royalist. He came to view the Empire with a strange, bleak kind of nostalgia, like someone who has lost his religion and then half-found it again. </p> <p>And this is one of the interesting things about Roth: he seems to treat the State as if it were God, and God as if he were some kind of bureaucratic arm of the State.

      "bodyText": "Rebellion Joseph Roth, translated by Michael Hofmann (Granta, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Congratulations to Granta, who have, with this, now made all Joseph Roth's completed novels available in English for the first time. Roth is one of those writers perhaps more heard of than read (his novel The Legend of the Holy Drinker was made into a fine film, starring Rutger Hauer, in 1988); now is your chance to catch up on him. This isn't a representative Roth novel, it has to be said. Roth - alcoholic yet industrious; journalist and novelist; a pacifist with a military bearing - was a bundle of contradictions at the best of times, not that there were, for him, many good times at all. Growing up poor, with no father, he was intelligent enough to be sceptical about the Austro-Hungarian Empire that nurtured him, yet at the same time under no illusions about any of the political alternatives that came to be offered after the first world war. As Michael Hofmann points out in his excellent introduction, he went to Soviet Russia in 1926 - two years after Rebellion - as an idealist and came back, as Walter Benjamin disappointedly noted, a royalist. He came to view the Empire with a strange, bleak kind of nostalgia, like someone who has lost his religion and then half-found it again. And this is one of the interesting things about Roth: he seems to treat the State as if it were God, and God as if he were some kind of bureaucratic arm of the State. In Rebellion he writes: \"The government is something that overlies man like the sky overlies the earth. What comes from it may be good or ill, but it cannot be other than great and all-powerful, unknowable and mysterious, even though on occasion it may be understood by an ordinary person.\" Those, neatly ventriloquized, are the thoughts of the ordinary person at the heart and centre-stage of Rebellion: Andreas Pum, a war veteran who has lost a leg but has a permit to play the hurdy-gurdy on the street. Pum is, frankly, an idiot; and whether his government-worship is a function of his cretinism, or the other way round, is something that Roth leaves for us to decide for ourselves. Pum thinks of criminals and malcontents as \"heathens\", until one day he falls foul of the law. Imprisoned for six weeks, he undergoes an overwhelming change of body and heart, and, reduced to both senility and the position of a lavatory attendant, becomes himself one of those malcontents he used to loathe. Roth's tale has that very European, straightforward, fairy-tale logic that makes everything both inevitable yet strangely nightmarish. You wouldn't be far wrong to think of Roth as occupying the fourth corner of a square whose other apices are Kafka, Musil and Stefan Zweig. But Roth's position was mutable. Here, in his second acknowledged novel (he disowned his first), he is still the angry left-winger, an almost didactic fabulist. You can already tell, though, that he's more than just a polemicist.

Most Orthodox clergy everywhere believe that the Nato bombing of Kosovo was part of that same demonic plot. As the author again and again encounters such ideas and attitudes, the reader shares her disappointment, especially when a cleric had initially seemed engaging or impressive, or both. </p> <p>And yet churches, like men, are not all of a piece. Archbishop Christodoulos of Greece, whose slogan is \"Orthodoxy is cool\", is presently wasting his prestige in a foolish campaign over the removal of religious affiliation from those same identity cards.

Their coexistence with democracy, in most cases, has only just begun, and their engagement with secular values has yet to acquire the complexity that marks Christian life and belief in the west. </p> <p>One question that the nature of her journey does not allow Clark to explore is how influential the Orthodox churches and their clergy actually are in the different Orthodox countries.

Tragedy deprived him of his parents and made him his brother's keeper; it also gave him his story, the heartbreaking story that called forth his staggering genius. What would he have done without it? </p> <p>The easy answer is that he would have done what he does now (now that he has turned 30 and published a bestselling memoir), which is to edit <a href=\"http://www.mcsweeneys.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">McSweeney's</a>, a delightful and unclassifiable publication, supposedly quarterly, that has appeared four times since the fall of 1998.</p> <p>Eggers has gathered a smart group of contributors, mostly young, a few known to the novel-reading public (David Foster Wallace, Rick Moody, Jonathan Lethem) and many of them living in Brooklyn, New York. Like filigree around the assembled short stories, essays, spoofs and prose experiments, Eggers editorialises in manic fine print. A maze of text and diagram, the magazine is witty, self-conscious, eclectic, casually postmodern, eager to please, not bothered about giving offence - and endlessly ironic. </p> <p>If you want the flavour of McSweeney's, open A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and take a look at the \"Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of this Book\" (in which he allows that the first 109 pages \"are all some of you might want to bother with... The book thereafter is kind of uneven\"), the \"Preface to this Edition\" (\"For all the author's bluster elsewhere, this is not, actually, a work of pure non-fiction. Many parts have been fictionalised in varying degrees, for various purposes\") and the \"Acknowledgments\" (\"The author would like to acknowledge that he does not look good in red... Further, the author, and those behind the making of this book, would like to acknowledge that yes, there are perhaps too many memoir-sorts of books being written at this juncture\") - in all, nearly 40 pages of clever throat-clearing before you get to chapter one, where the heartbreak begins. </p> <p>Before McSweeney's there was Might, a satirical magazine for twentysomethings. Its motto was \"Screw Those Idiots\". The \"kind of uneven\" last two thirds of A Heartbreaking Work tell the story of how Eggers and a few friends launched, laboured over and eventually abandoned Might. But though Might had its moment and McSweeney's has acquired a chic cult following, editing quarterlies is a slow path to stardom, and Eggers craves fame. In the five months since the US publication of his Heartbreaking Work, following an avalanche of rave reviews, he has allowed his diva temperament to blossom. </p> <p>I suspect he would have liked to be a pop star, or a professional athlete. After the trauma of his parents' death (the father's sudden, the mother's lingering, and achingly evoked), Eggers and his little brother, Toph, headed west from the posh Chicago suburb where they were raised; in California, driving to the beach, they sing. \"There are times when I'm concerned about Toph's expression when I'm really singing, with vibrato and all, singing the guitar parts and everything - an expression that to the untrained eye might look like abject terror, or revulsion - but I know well enough that it is awe.\" It's an exhilarating scene, youth's escape from the sickroom, and when they reach the beach, there's more exhilaration. They play frisbee: \"Oh, we are good. He's only eight but together we are spectacular.\" </p> <p>Eggers tried hard to break into television - he wanted a part in MTV's Real World. He documents his audition and turns it into a postmodern commentary on his own self-conscious self-promotion. It's not normally a star-making profession, but Eggers could have become a book reviewer. I can't think of a single complaint about his book (and I have many, including sloppiness, solipsism and triteness) that the author hasn't already generously pointed out. \"He too is well aware of all of the book's flaws and shortcomings, whatever you consider them to be, and... tips his hat to you for noticing them.\" Preempting criticism doesn't necessarily make it go away, but it does inhibit the poor critic. </p> <p>Of course, without tragedy Eggers might have become a novelist. His prose is loose-jointed, colloquial, relaxed-looking but capable of piercing accuracy. When he drops the gimmicks, he can be hilarious and devastating - sometimes both at once. Of course, he knows this. He tells the MTV executive, \"I can do it funny, or maudlin, or just straight, uninflected - anything. You tell me. I can do it sad, or inspirational, or angry.\"</p> <p>The first chapter, about his parents' decline, is a kind of terminal-patient slapstick, a queasy, improbable routine that works: \"You should see the area where her stomach was. It's grown like a pumpkin. Round, bloated. It's odd - they removed the stomach, and some of the surrounding area if I remember correctly, but even with the removal of so much thereabouts, she looks pregnant. You can see it, the bulge, even under the blanket. I'm assuming it's the cancer, but I haven't asked my mother... Was it the bloating of the starving child? I don't know. I don't ask questions. Before, when I said I asked questions, I lied.\" </p> <p>Eggers has talent as a writer - but his true genius is for PR. He'd make a great circus barker. \"I want everyone to witness my youth,\" he declares. \"I am an orphan of America.\" His Heartbreaking Work is a mannerist flourish; it marks an especially self-conscious moment in the ongoing proliferation of those \"memoir-sorts of books\". Only sporadically is the reader wholly engaged as one is by an achieved work of art. Curious and at times compelling, this book is more like an artifact, a bright and blaring sign of the times.</p> <p>\u0095 Adam Begley is books editor of The New York Observer.</p>",

At the V&amp;A, Amanda Foreman married a man whose nickname, apparently, is Reg, on account of the number of women who have given him the push (or \"rejected\" him, geddit?). We can only assume that this means an end to Ms Foreman's career as a nude model, and indeed to the devil-may-care approach that the Loafer detected when the historian was shortlisted for the Whitbread Prize. \"Bill\", as she is puzzlingly known, was overheard in the ladies uttering the terrifying phrase \"Let's cruise!\" to a chum. \u0095 The nation's poets have momentarily taken their minds off free booze and comely young women to see if they have appeared on the shortlist for the Forward Prize. The lucky few in line for \u00a310,000 include John Burnside, Michael Donaghy, Kathleen Jamie, Douglas Dunn and Matthew Sweeney. The winner is not announced until 4 October, to coincide with National Poetry Day, so the Loafer suggests a small digestif to calm the nerves.",

And it is always a pleasure to find Proust on the same page as a Walloon proverb, or Mrs Thatcher - where she belongs - alongside Oscar Wilde. </p> <p>This wonderful range, however, reveals a depressing fact. There is nothing to say about words, it seems, that has not already been said, several times, and better, before. Stephen Fry, for example, may be surprised to discover that he is neither as funny nor as clever when it comes to writing about clich\u00e9s as Ambrose Bierce, Hazlitt or Miguel de Unamuno. The truly memorable, original and startling insights - such as Chomsky's paraphrase illustrating generative grammar, \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" - are few and far between. </p> <p>For a subject with no apparent beginning, no middle and no end, writing about language appears merely to repeat itself, with minor variations. This may be because language is a closed system: we can never quite say what we mean, or mean what we say, and so we circle, like flies around a rotting corpse. The most important times in our lives are in fact those when we break out of language - those moments when words are few: birth, sex, death, doing the washing-up. It's often silence that makes us beautiful, and words that make us sad. Indeed, words, one suspects, like people, hide a secret desire and sorrow: that they are not other words, or not words at all. </p> <p>In their lovely, limpid, hopeful introduction, the Crystals invite proposals for inclusion in a possible second edition of the book.

Despite an impressive ability to create and manage a range of atmospheres - the noir thriller, establishing itself in subterranean oyster bars and echoing apartments; the father-and-son drama, patiently unfolding in diners and on campsites; even the comic possibilities presented by a grief management workshop - Paling never quite succeeds in pulling all the elements of his novel together. </p> <p>His narrative, which proceeds by flashback, digression, half-remembered incidents and meandering meditation, apes his hero's incoherence just that little bit too much to keep the reader involved.

Inexplicable tragedy is precisely that; but the novelist needs to go some way towards suggesting explanations, if only to reject them. </p> <p>That said, Paling is a great thing among British writers: a largely unsung talent who keeps on experimenting and refuses to write an easy book.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> The Government's Annual Report</strong> <br>The Stationery Office, \u00a32.99, 65pp</p> <p>At one point in Scottish drug addict Alexander Trocchi's notorious novel Cain's Book, he writes: \"Loose ends, things unrelated, shifts, nightmare journeys, cities arrived at and left, meetings, desertions, betrayals, all manner of unions, adulteries, triumphs, defeats... These are facts.\" </p> <p>How strange then to find the same words in the introduction to the government's annual report: \"These are the facts. People can make their own judgement on them. But my assessment is that most of the key measures are going in the right direction. And for those that are not we are putting in place plans to turn them round.\" </p> <p>In Trocchi's case, the illusion of factuality is grist to his fictional mill. In a government report, one hopes for something less tricksy, although there has long been an intriguing relationship between political documents and more traditional forms of literature. In the days before Hansard, Samuel Johnson himself used to write up versions of parliamentary proceedings for a journal called the Gentleman's Magazine. It was against the law to report verbatim parliamentary debates, so Johnson did it in a thinly fictionalised form. </p> <p>Although the usual run of government material makes for dull reading (the Pink Books and the Red Books and the Blue, the Green and White Papers), some is fascinating, as the Stationery Office realised when it decided to publish its Uncovered Editions series. This offers official but far from dusty accounts of events in history and politics. Never before made available to the reading public, the titles in the series (see below) are drawn from the Controller's Library, a unique archive of official government publications. </p> <p>One doubts that this report will ever be republished in such a way, even though it too is a Stationery Office publication - one that makes you think that once august organisation, formerly HMSO, lost some gravity when it was privatised in 1996 after 200 years in the public sector. </p> <p>The authorship of the report is mysterious. Although the Prime Minister is said to have written the introduction, a coda points to a body called the Annual Reports Desk at 10 Downing Street. The first two reports on the Blair administration were greeted as, at best, Labour Party manifestos produced at taxpayers' expense, at worst blatant propaganda. Many argued that rather than do it itself, the government should allow the National Audit Office independently to audit its manifesto pledges and its delivery of public services. </p> <p>For all that, this is an interesting document. The introduction is the section that repays the most study. Mr Blair, if it be he, continues thus: \"Only by laying down the foundations, dealing with debt, sorting out the public finances, cutting down on fraud and abuse, could we begin to make real investment and improvements in public services.\" </p> <p>It has an odd conditionality, that \"could\", doesn't it? There is an uneasy tentativeness about its use in this context, as if conceding that these mighty innovations are not yet under way. There is also something of the housewife under siege in the paragraph, as if the Prime Minister were Hyacinth Bouquet: What are you thinking of? How could I possibly even begin to do the dusting when there is a tank on my drive? </p> <p>An annual report in most contexts would be perceived as a document of fact. This has very much the feel of a document of assertion: it even needs to assert that it is factual, reminding one of those Rider Haggard novels with a bogus framing device in which the discovered narrative is purported to be genuine. </p> <p>Assertion tends to be a forward-thrusting, even aggressive mode. There is plenty of thrusting here, the kind of bullet-point, clause-avoiding Anglo-Saxon clarity that we have grown used to in the Labour rhetoric. Tough on crime and its causes is back, as is another favourite old refrain, albeit splendidly deflated by the sentence after it: \"We said education, education, education. The spending review will confirm our commitment.\" </p> <p>Opposite the introduction, in one of the red sound-bite paragraphs that pepper the document, comes another assertion, one that has very weird deixis, as grammarians call the process by which writers suggest a present atmosphere. The foundations of the novelist's art, deictic words - words such as now, here, this, or next week - suggest the temporal and geographic context in which they are used. \"This,\" it says with a nod at Will Hutton and John Motson, \"is the state of play.\" </p> <p>In other words, the game is not over. Some people (and I write as Labour voter) think it's up. As Mr Hague remarked in parliament, there is a lot of \"getting there\" in this text: over 150 transitional verbs in a 65-page document. </p> <p>In some ways, this willingness to concede that there is still much to be done is modest and attractive. In other ways, it conjures up a vision of an awful, eternal, imperfect present. One gets the impression that, like Sisyphus, politicians and civil servants are endlessly rolling the executive and administrative rock up the mountains of amelioration and contingency. \"We have a long way to go to meet our goal...\" says Tony glumly at one point. </p> <p>Perhaps the most striking image of this type comes in a sentence referring to the NHS: \"Unnecessary red tape is being cut,\" it states baldly. While one is grateful for any situation in which a clich\u00e9 is given an injection of semantic life, it is hard to banish the thought that, right now, someone is hard at work with the scissors.</p> <p>Further on in the introduction, in a rare figurative flourish, comes the image of government as a taxi driver with a defective steering lock: \"Few things have been harder than turning round our transport system.\" After all that surreal transitionary self-consciousness, it is relief to find what one might expect to be the mainstay of such a document, an honest-to-goodness perfect tense: \"More than one million children have been lifted out of poverty.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's introduction is followed by separate sections describing \"promises made becoming promises kept\": they include devolution, the economy, work and welfare, Europe, education, health, environment, crime and housing. Each one is followed by v\u00e9rit\u00e9 snippets in which we learn of the success of particular ventures related to the topic in hand - small business in Devon, a benefit office in Milton Keynes. There are pictures, too. </p> <p>The main body of the report is far better written, clearer and more useful than the introduction, which reads like the work of diverse hands. Generally, the vibe is good - but don't hold your breath for utopia. As a section called \"prosperity for all\" puts it: \"The Government's vision of a fair and inclusive society will take time to become a reality.\" </p> <p>Alas, as TS Eliot pointed out in Four Quartets, \"human kind cannot bear very much reality\". Perhaps this is why it was thought necessary to include a gelded section called \"more out of this life\". Here the Government's belief in the beneficial effects of artistic and sporting creativity is, well, not exactly spelled out. \"In culture and sport, as in education or health, the Government believes in supporting excellence - but also excellence for the many, not the few.\" Athletics, the Lottery, the Media (new and old), Millennium Celebrations (\"while the Dome remains controversial...\") and football are the key notes sounded. Literature, music (neither pop nor classical), and the theatre are noticeable only through their absence. </p> <p>Overall, this report is to applauded for its insistence on what emerges as a major underlying theme - the reduction of poverty - and to be deplored for its insistence on presenting government achievements as \"work in progress\" rather than telling us exactly what has and hasn't been done; rather than, in other words, giving it to us straight.</p> <p><strong> Blue Book</strong> </p> <p> The report of a House of Commons Select Committee or a Royal Commission, etc. </p> <p> <strong> Pink Book</strong> </p> <p> The annual analysis of Britain's balance of payments. </p> <p> <strong> White Paper</strong> </p> <p> A statement of government policy and proposed legislation on a particular topic. </p> <p> <strong> Green Paper</strong> </p> <p> A statement by the government not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. </p> <p> <strong> Red Book</strong> </p> <p> The Chancellor's Financial Statement and Budget Report, containing analyses of public spending and a report on medium-term financial strategy. The oldest of the books, it first appeared in 1230 as the Liber ruber Scaccarii, or the Red Book of the Exchequer. </p> <p> <strong> Hansard</strong> </p> <p> In 1809 William Cobbett turned to printer TC Hansard to print his records of parliamentary proceedings. Hansard later came under the control of Horatio Bottomley, one of the 19th century's most infamous conmen. From 1866 the publication came under the control of parliament itself. </p> <p> <strong> Any other business</strong> </p> <p> The Scarman (the Brixton riots) and Scott (arms to Iraq) reports were judicial rather than government documents. Official documents published in the Stationery Office Uncovered Editions series include: John Profumo and Christine Keeler, The Loss of the Titanic, The Judgement of Nuremberg, and UFOs in the House of Lords, a debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p> <p>\u0095 Giles Foden is the author of two novels, Ladysmith and The Last King of Scotland.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Government's Annual Report The Stationery Office, \u00a32.99, 65pp At one point in Scottish drug addict Alexander Trocchi's notorious novel Cain's Book, he writes: \"Loose ends, things unrelated, shifts, nightmare journeys, cities arrived at and left, meetings, desertions, betrayals, all manner of unions, adulteries, triumphs, defeats... These are facts.\" How strange then to find the same words in the introduction to the government's annual report: \"These are the facts. People can make their own judgement on them. But my assessment is that most of the key measures are going in the right direction. And for those that are not we are putting in place plans to turn them round.\" In Trocchi's case, the illusion of factuality is grist to his fictional mill. In a government report, one hopes for something less tricksy, although there has long been an intriguing relationship between political documents and more traditional forms of literature. In the days before Hansard, Samuel Johnson himself used to write up versions of parliamentary proceedings for a journal called the Gentleman's Magazine. It was against the law to report verbatim parliamentary debates, so Johnson did it in a thinly fictionalised form. Although the usual run of government material makes for dull reading (the Pink Books and the Red Books and the Blue, the Green and White Papers), some is fascinating, as the Stationery Office realised when it decided to publish its Uncovered Editions series. This offers official but far from dusty accounts of events in history and politics. Never before made available to the reading public, the titles in the series (see below) are drawn from the Controller's Library, a unique archive of official government publications. One doubts that this report will ever be republished in such a way, even though it too is a Stationery Office publication - one that makes you think that once august organisation, formerly HMSO, lost some gravity when it was privatised in 1996 after 200 years in the public sector. The authorship of the report is mysterious. Although the Prime Minister is said to have written the introduction, a coda points to a body called the Annual Reports Desk at 10 Downing Street. The first two reports on the Blair administration were greeted as, at best, Labour Party manifestos produced at taxpayers' expense, at worst blatant propaganda. Many argued that rather than do it itself, the government should allow the National Audit Office independently to audit its manifesto pledges and its delivery of public services. For all that, this is an interesting document. The introduction is the section that repays the most study. Mr Blair, if it be he, continues thus: \"Only by laying down the foundations, dealing with debt, sorting out the public finances, cutting down on fraud and abuse, could we begin to make real investment and improvements in public services.\" It has an odd conditionality, that \"could\", doesn't it? There is an uneasy tentativeness about its use in this context, as if conceding that these mighty innovations are not yet under way. There is also something of the housewife under siege in the paragraph, as if the Prime Minister were Hyacinth Bouquet: What are you thinking of? How could I possibly even begin to do the dusting when there is a tank on my drive? An annual report in most contexts would be perceived as a document of fact. This has very much the feel of a document of assertion: it even needs to assert that it is factual, reminding one of those Rider Haggard novels with a bogus framing device in which the discovered narrative is purported to be genuine. Assertion tends to be a forward-thrusting, even aggressive mode. There is plenty of thrusting here, the kind of bullet-point, clause-avoiding Anglo-Saxon clarity that we have grown used to in the Labour rhetoric. Tough on crime and its causes is back, as is another favourite old refrain, albeit splendidly deflated by the sentence after it: \"We said education, education, education. The spending review will confirm our commitment.\" Opposite the introduction, in one of the red sound-bite paragraphs that pepper the document, comes another assertion, one that has very weird deixis, as grammarians call the process by which writers suggest a present atmosphere. The foundations of the novelist's art, deictic words - words such as now, here, this, or next week - suggest the temporal and geographic context in which they are used. \"This,\" it says with a nod at Will Hutton and John Motson, \"is the state of play.\" In other words, the game is not over. Some people (and I write as Labour voter) think it's up. As Mr Hague remarked in parliament, there is a lot of \"getting there\" in this text: over 150 transitional verbs in a 65-page document. In some ways, this willingness to concede that there is still much to be done is modest and attractive. In other ways, it conjures up a vision of an awful, eternal, imperfect present. One gets the impression that, like Sisyphus, politicians and civil servants are endlessly rolling the executive and administrative rock up the mountains of amelioration and contingency. \"We have a long way to go to meet our goal...\" says Tony glumly at one point. Perhaps the most striking image of this type comes in a sentence referring to the NHS: \"Unnecessary red tape is being cut,\" it states baldly. While one is grateful for any situation in which a clich\u00e9 is given an injection of semantic life, it is hard to banish the thought that, right now, someone is hard at work with the scissors. Further on in the introduction, in a rare figurative flourish, comes the image of government as a taxi driver with a defective steering lock: \"Few things have been harder than turning round our transport system.\" After all that surreal transitionary self-consciousness, it is relief to find what one might expect to be the mainstay of such a document, an honest-to-goodness perfect tense: \"More than one million children have been lifted out of poverty.\" Mr Blair's introduction is followed by separate sections describing \"promises made becoming promises kept\": they include devolution, the economy, work and welfare, Europe, education, health, environment, crime and housing. Each one is followed by v\u00e9rit\u00e9 snippets in which we learn of the success of particular ventures related to the topic in hand - small business in Devon, a benefit office in Milton Keynes. There are pictures, too. The main body of the report is far better written, clearer and more useful than the introduction, which reads like the work of diverse hands. Generally, the vibe is good - but don't hold your breath for utopia. As a section called \"prosperity for all\" puts it: \"The Government's vision of a fair and inclusive society will take time to become a reality.\" Alas, as TS Eliot pointed out in Four Quartets, \"human kind cannot bear very much reality\". Perhaps this is why it was thought necessary to include a gelded section called \"more out of this life\". Here the Government's belief in the beneficial effects of artistic and sporting creativity is, well, not exactly spelled out. \"In culture and sport, as in education or health, the Government believes in supporting excellence - but also excellence for the many, not the few.\" Athletics, the Lottery, the Media (new and old), Millennium Celebrations (\"while the Dome remains controversial...\") and football are the key notes sounded. Literature, music (neither pop nor classical), and the theatre are noticeable only through their absence. Overall, this report is to applauded for its insistence on what emerges as a major underlying theme - the reduction of poverty - and to be deplored for its insistence on presenting government achievements as \"work in progress\" rather than telling us exactly what has and hasn't been done; rather than, in other words, giving it to us straight. Blue Book The report of a House of Commons Select Committee or a Royal Commission, etc. Pink Book The annual analysis of Britain's balance of payments. White Paper A statement of government policy and proposed legislation on a particular topic. Green Paper A statement by the government not of policy already determined, but of propositions put before the whole nation for discussion. Red Book The Chancellor's Financial Statement and Budget Report, containing analyses of public spending and a report on medium-term financial strategy. The oldest of the books, it first appeared in 1230 as the Liber ruber Scaccarii, or the Red Book of the Exchequer. Hansard In 1809 William Cobbett turned to printer TC Hansard to print his records of parliamentary proceedings. Hansard later came under the control of Horatio Bottomley, one of the 19th century's most infamous conmen. From 1866 the publication came under the control of parliament itself. Any other business The Scarman (the Brixton riots) and Scott (arms to Iraq) reports were judicial rather than government documents. Official documents published in the Stationery Office Uncovered Editions series include: John Profumo and Christine Keeler, The Loss of the Titanic, The Judgement of Nuremberg, and UFOs in the House of Lords, a debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life. \u0095 Giles Foden is the author of two novels, Ladysmith and The Last King of Scotland.",

Sometimes her poetry has the insistence of urgently whispered advice. </p> <p>Like another post-war Polish poet, Rosewicz, she doubts the efficacy of poetry while at the same time devoting herself to it. Such refinement can be hard work. \"First, it is a struggle,\" says Szymborska, \"because, obviously, at the very core of every poem, there is emotion. What you have to do is fight against this emotion. If you were to use emotions only it would be enough to say: 'I love you. Full stop. Don't leave me. What shall I do without you? Oh my poor country!

After all, she says, ruefully, \"Sadness is a beautiful category.\" </p> <p>Szymborska's quest for simplicity explains why this delightful poet loathes to play the poet's role. She just can't understand why people still want to interview her. \"For the last few years my favourite phrase has been 'I don't know'. I've reached the age of self-knowledge, so I don't know anything. People who claim that they know something are responsible for most of the fuss in the world.\" </p> <p>But surely the Nobel Prize is a recognition of her wisdom? Even here she has a story to counter such a claim. \"It all happened because of a friend in the States. It's all because of his sofa.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown is expected to announce a huge and unexpected boost for school sport on Tuesday in a move mirroring a decision taken by Charles de Gaulle 40 years ago that led to the revival of France as a world sporting power. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, who made school sport the top priority in his spending bid, is said to have won a huge increase in funding from the chancellor, who once described himself as \"sports crazy\". The bid for \u00a3200m - five times the present Treasury funding for Sport England - is understood to have been largely met but will be split between Mr Smith's department and the Department for Education and Employment. Ministers are said to have been influenced in deciding to give more money by England's poor showing in Euro 2000, Wimbledon, the cricket World Cup, and the last Olympics. A Sport England survey also showed a huge decline in primary school children taking physical education lessons - from 32% to 11% between 1994 and 1999. Teenagers, too, usually stop playing sport as soon as they leave school. The figures are said to have alarmed ministers who are already concerned about the failure of the UK to produce new sporting heroes - particularly with Premiership football clubs relying ever more on foreign players. The new funding is to be split into two parts - a revolutionary national scheme involving professional coaches to back teachers in schools, and a new investment programme in school and community sports facilities. The main argument behind Mr Smith's bid is that teachers are under unprecedented pressure to meet the continually changing demands of the national curriculum and the call for higher academic standards. Mr Smith wants schools to be able to employ professional coaches to train and inspire schoolchildren to play sport - and also give support to teachers who cannot spare the time to train youngsters. The scheme will build on projects already being run by Sport England to encourage coaches and sporting stars to teach at schools and youth centres. Sport England has had trouble persuading the celebrities to attend as all it can offer is to pay their fares. Mr Smith is said to want to launch a national scheme so that primary and secondary schools can benefit and have the money to employ professional coaches in football, rugby, swimming, cricket, tennis and athletics. He would also like some of Britain's former world class athletes - who benefitted from public funds - to participate. Sport England receives only \u00a340m a year from the Treasury and only a small proportion of the money goes to schools. It receives far more from the national lottery, but this is dropping every year and was down from \u00a3300m to \u00a3200m a year over the past three years. The other part of the sports bid would be funded through the education department and would involve a big increase in the school building programme to pay for all-weather pitches, gyms and swimming pools.

      "byline": "Stephen Cook",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you move to the country and get a dog, there's no alternative to plenty of walking. For novelist Fiona Walker, it's meant the discovery and exploration of a half-lost, little-changed English landscape where the river Evenlode winds among rolling hills and honey-coloured villages. </p> <p>On the map it's a kind of no-man's land where the borders of Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire are knotted together, but on the ground it's a succession of quiet delights: old manor houses, ancient churches, beautiful views, changing weather and the kind of pubs it's difficult to pass. </p> <p>Her favourite walk starts in the village of Adlestrop, where an express train made an unplanned stop early last century and prompted Edward Thomas to write his famous poem (\"What I saw / Was Adlestrop - only the name / And willows, willow-herb and grass / And meadowsweet and haycocks dry...\") </p> <p>The station has been dismantled, but you can see its old sign in the village before setting off north past the big house. It's uphill, giving Walker the perspective she likes so much: \"Almost every view has one or two villages in it, and on a good day you can count about five church spires and three or four grand country houses.\" </p> <p>From this hill, the main house you see is Chastleton, one of the country's best- preserved Jacobean buildings. It dates from 1612, and has recently had six years' restoration by the National Trust. It has weird garden topiary and claims to be the place where the rules of modern croquet were codified in 1865. </p> <p>Walker, often with friends in tow and a pub lunch in prospect, presses on past Peasewell Wood, over the iron-age Chastleton Barrow and down the hill to Cornwell, where the architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis refurbished the old village houses in the 1930s. </p> <p>\"It's just exquisite, nestled in a crease of the wolds where different slopes meet, and you feel like you've walked into a different time zone,\" she says. \"Unfortunately, there's no pub there, although you might find an ice-cream van sailing past if you're lucky.\" </p> <p>From here it's another climb to skirt the wall of Daylesford House, take in more views, then drop to cross the railway and the winding Evenlode: Walker's Jack Russell terrier, Jelly, sometimes takes a swim and can't climb back up the steep banks. </p> <p>The Fox at Lower Oddington, with its pints of Hook Norton bitter, is beckoning hard now, but you can delay the moment with a glimpse of hell: the village church of St Nicholas has a macabre 14th-century \"doom painting\" which shows a good man being hauled up a heavenly tower by an angel, a damned soul dangling from a gibbet, and the large, richly-dressed figure of Pride being dragged into the mouth of Hell. It dates from the 15th century, was whitewashed over in the 17th, and rediscovered in 1912. </p> <p>The move from the image to the word after the Reformation led to the covering of most church wall paintings, and many were lost for good when Victorians hacked off plaster to expose what they considered to be the beautiful stonework. </p> <p>But the paintings in St Nicholas were saved by their location: by Victorian times, the population had shifted to Upper Oddington, a new church was built there, and St Nicholas fell into the neglect, which preserved its pictures for 20th-century rediscovery. It now stands isolated to the south-east of the village. </p> <p>\"Personally, I'm for getting to the pub first, which is pretty much the end of the walk, and perhaps coming back to look at the picture afterwards,\" says Walker. \"By this time you'll have done about seven miles and spent up to about four hours on it, so lunch at the end is a good thing. </p> <p>Walker's books are sometimes described as \"bonkbusters\", with a recurring character called at one point \"her much-neglected love bud\". On shorter daily walks with just the dog for company, she works on the plots, tries bits of dialogue out loud, and occasionally frightens other walkers. </p> <p>One example was when the dog disappeared and she hid in a ditch - a standard ploy for getting him back: \"After a while, I heard panting and the jingling of an identity tag, so I leapt out of the ditch and yelled: 'There you are, you bugger!' And it was this bloke with a spaniel. He just ran, white-faced. </p> <p>\"I went after him shouting I was sorry, but it was no good. I suppose it was one in the eye for men who terrify women occasionally, but I must have come across like the mad woman of the Cotswolds.\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>For general information and places to stay, phone the Tourist Information Office at Stow-on-the-Wold (01451 831082) or Chipping Norton (01608 644 379) or visit <a href=\"http://www.visit-glos.org.uk\">www.visit-glos.org.uk</a>.

      "bodyText": "If you move to the country and get a dog, there's no alternative to plenty of walking. For novelist Fiona Walker, it's meant the discovery and exploration of a half-lost, little-changed English landscape where the river Evenlode winds among rolling hills and honey-coloured villages. On the map it's a kind of no-man's land where the borders of Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Gloucestershire are knotted together, but on the ground it's a succession of quiet delights: old manor houses, ancient churches, beautiful views, changing weather and the kind of pubs it's difficult to pass. Her favourite walk starts in the village of Adlestrop, where an express train made an unplanned stop early last century and prompted Edward Thomas to write his famous poem (\"What I saw / Was Adlestrop - only the name / And willows, willow-herb and grass / And meadowsweet and haycocks dry...\") The station has been dismantled, but you can see its old sign in the village before setting off north past the big house. It's uphill, giving Walker the perspective she likes so much: \"Almost every view has one or two villages in it, and on a good day you can count about five church spires and three or four grand country houses.\" From this hill, the main house you see is Chastleton, one of the country's best- preserved Jacobean buildings. It dates from 1612, and has recently had six years' restoration by the National Trust. It has weird garden topiary and claims to be the place where the rules of modern croquet were codified in 1865. Walker, often with friends in tow and a pub lunch in prospect, presses on past Peasewell Wood, over the iron-age Chastleton Barrow and down the hill to Cornwell, where the architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis refurbished the old village houses in the 1930s. \"It's just exquisite, nestled in a crease of the wolds where different slopes meet, and you feel like you've walked into a different time zone,\" she says. \"Unfortunately, there's no pub there, although you might find an ice-cream van sailing past if you're lucky.\" From here it's another climb to skirt the wall of Daylesford House, take in more views, then drop to cross the railway and the winding Evenlode: Walker's Jack Russell terrier, Jelly, sometimes takes a swim and can't climb back up the steep banks. The Fox at Lower Oddington, with its pints of Hook Norton bitter, is beckoning hard now, but you can delay the moment with a glimpse of hell: the village church of St Nicholas has a macabre 14th-century \"doom painting\" which shows a good man being hauled up a heavenly tower by an angel, a damned soul dangling from a gibbet, and the large, richly-dressed figure of Pride being dragged into the mouth of Hell. It dates from the 15th century, was whitewashed over in the 17th, and rediscovered in 1912. The move from the image to the word after the Reformation led to the covering of most church wall paintings, and many were lost for good when Victorians hacked off plaster to expose what they considered to be the beautiful stonework. But the paintings in St Nicholas were saved by their location: by Victorian times, the population had shifted to Upper Oddington, a new church was built there, and St Nicholas fell into the neglect, which preserved its pictures for 20th-century rediscovery. It now stands isolated to the south-east of the village. \"Personally, I'm for getting to the pub first, which is pretty much the end of the walk, and perhaps coming back to look at the picture afterwards,\" says Walker. \"By this time you'll have done about seven miles and spent up to about four hours on it, so lunch at the end is a good thing. Walker's books are sometimes described as \"bonkbusters\", with a recurring character called at one point \"her much-neglected love bud\". On shorter daily walks with just the dog for company, she works on the plots, tries bits of dialogue out loud, and occasionally frightens other walkers. One example was when the dog disappeared and she hid in a ditch - a standard ploy for getting him back: \"After a while, I heard panting and the jingling of an identity tag, so I leapt out of the ditch and yelled: 'There you are, you bugger!' And it was this bloke with a spaniel. He just ran, white-faced. \"I went after him shouting I was sorry, but it was no good. I suppose it was one in the eye for men who terrify women occasionally, but I must have come across like the mad woman of the Cotswolds.\" The practicals For general information and places to stay, phone the Tourist Information Office at Stow-on-the-Wold (01451 831082) or Chipping Norton (01608 644 379) or visit www.visit-glos.org.uk.

For in Scotland, the game is much more open than in the rest of the world, with a few dishonourable exceptions. The whole of Scotland is teeming with golf courses - about 540 of them - and most of them are open to the golf-playing public. Some are great, some more humble and often, if you pass one and you have your clubs in the back of the car, it will be worth enquiring whether you can have a round. </p> <p>But if you want a guide to some of the best, here, in no particular order, is a top 10. </p> <p><strong> St Andrews</strong><br> Not everybody realises that the most famous golf course in the world, the Old, is public and that anyone can play it. In theory, that is. In practice, it takes more than a little organisation (see below), but whatever it takes it is worth it. This is how golf began, with all the idiosyncrasies of those early courses still perfectly preserved and still, amazingly, offering a serious and correct challenge to the modern golfer. Everything about St Andrews, the town and the 99 holes of golf offered, is unique and it is every professional golfer's wish to win here. When Nick Faldo won in 1990, he averaged 67.5 strokes per round which, as Steve Isaac, a Royal and Ancient agronomist observed, was \"not murdering the course: a mild mugging perhaps\". </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 24 for men, 36 for women. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> \u00a380 a round. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Links clubhouse open from 6am. Also lots of pubs and hotels nearby. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01334 466666. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Put in your request at least a year in advance. Applications are acknowledged and held on file until October/November when they are processed in order of receipt for the following year. A request for a time in high season (April 1-October 31) must be accom panied by a request for a time on one of the St Andrews Links Trust's other courses (there are five: the New, Jubilee, Eden, Strathtyrum and Balgove, which is nine holes). Or you can take pot luck in the ballot. Every day except Sunday (the Old Course is closed on Sundays), there is a draw for a number of times the following day. The Saturday draw is for play on Monday. You have to enter by phone or in person the morning before you wish to play and the ballot is drawn after 2pm. The results are announced on <a href=\"http://www.golfagent.com\">www.golfagent.com</a> and, after 4pm, they are posted at the Links clubhouse, the starters' boxes, the caddie manager's office, local golf clubs and the tourist information centre.

Certainly, it has one of the all-time great tees in golf, the ninth, which has the sea crash ing around on three sides and presents a fearsome carry over waves, rocks and cliff edge to the fairway. The 10th is a beauty, too, curving around a driftwood- and seaweed-strewn bay, with magnificent views out to the huge rock of Ailsa Craig. The course hosted perhaps the greatest major championship of them all, the 1977 Open confrontation between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus. Nicklaus, having birdied the last hole - only for Watson to do so also and win - was as gracious as ever in defeat. Wrapping an arm round his conqueror's shoulder, he said: \"You have seen my best - and you've beaten it.\" </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> There's no rule that says you even have to have a handicap. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> Weekdays \u00a3120 a round, weekends \u00a3150 a round (for non-residents). <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Restaurant/grill/bar at clubhouse. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01655 331000 and ask for pro's shop. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Hard to get a time.

One of the best stories came courtesy of the late Payne Stewart, at the time the US Open champion and in Scotland on vacation. A friend rang to see if Stewart could come and play but the assistant, catching only the fairly common Scottish surname, did not connect it with the American champion and explained that the course was full that week. When the tabloids inevitably got hold of it, it was \"Toffs Snub Champ\" all over the place. You can play if you pull the right levers, and wonderfully rewarding it is, too. Jack Nicklaus loved it so much he named his own course in Ohio after it, Muirfield Village, and he considered it to be the fairest of all the courses on the Open rota. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 18 for men, 24 for women.

It is a magnificent test of golf, hard by the Moray Firth, with a glut of great holes. Because it is fairly exposed, it is subject to - and is the better for - a wind, that can blow severely. Nairn needs only a few more yards to be worthy of an Open. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 28 for men, 36 for women. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> Weekdays \u00a360 a round, weekends \u00a365 a round. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Full catering. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01667 453208. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Members' times 9am-9.30am.

It is the most northerly championship course in the world, on the same latitude as Hudson Bay and Labrador. But, as the Michelin guides say, it is worth a detour as two players who arrived singly and were introduced on the first tee discovered. One had flown from New York to London to Inverness and then taxied to Dornoch; the other had driven from Birmingham and both had taken 10 hours. But they discovered a course that is a delight, wandering around the whins, the heather and the gorse in full accord with its surroundings. Tom Watson said of it: \"I have played none finer, a natural masterpiece.\" </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 24 for men, 39 for women. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> Weekdays \u00a357 a round, weekends \u00a367 a round.

Blocks of times for visitors but very busy mid-May to early October. <br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \u00a31.60-ish. <br> <strong> Address: </strong> Royal Dornoch, Golf Road, Dornoch IV25 3LW. <br> <strong> E-mail: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.royaldornoch.com\">www.royaldornoch.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Carnoustie</strong><br> This might have been purpose-built for the masochists of the golfing world. It is 7,371 yards long from the back tees and has a par of, wait for it, 71. It can be the hardest golf course in the world. Carnoustie is a brutal test even on a nice day and when, as so often occurs, the weather draws its great grey curtains, the bleakness of the surroundings can be overwhelming. The daunting nature of the course can be summed up in one word, and was when the comedian and singer Danny Kaye made the following entrance in the vistors' book: \"Murder,\" he wrote. The local council lost the plot in the 1970s and 80s, allowing the course to become a milked-out cash cow in clapped-out condition. It is restored now, so go and be proud if you get within five of your handicap. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 28 for men, 36 for women. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> \u00a370 all the time. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Golf club or the hotel. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01241 853789. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Weekends more difficult. After 2pm on Saturday, 11.30am on Sunday.<br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \u00a31.40-\u00a31.80. <br> <strong> Address: </strong> Carnoustie Golf Links, Links Parade, Carnoustie, Angus DD7 7JE. <br> <strong> Website: </strong> <a href=\"http://www.carnoustie.org/golf\">www.carnoustie.org/golf</a> </p> <p><strong> Royal Troon</strong><br> \"Royal\" was added to its name quite recently despite the fact that 50% of the world's population are not allowed on to the championship course. Women are expressly forbidden from playing there, presumably because they might strain themselves, poor dears. This barmy ban apart, Troon is a great place to play golf. The course runs out-and-back in the classical manner and, if the wind is from the north, the homeward half becomes monstrous. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 20 for men, 30 for women (on the Portland course). <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> \u00a3125 a day, includes coffee/lunch and a round on both the Old and the Portland courses (women excepted). \u00a385 a day includes coffee/lunch and two rounds on the Portland course. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Full catering, including Ailsa lounge, where you don't need to change and soft spikes (not hard) are permitted. In the dining room and smoke room, jacket and tie required. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01292 311555. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Old 9.30am-11am and 2.30pm-4pm; Portland 9am-10.30am and 2.30pm-4pm. Women and players under 18 can play the Portland course. Women are not allowed to play the championship course but are permitted to \"accompany and look decorative\". Are they allowed in the clubhouse? Doubtless, on special occasions, under armed guard. <br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \u00a31.73. <br> <strong> Address: </strong> Royal Troon Golf Club, Craigend Road, Troon, Ayshire KA10 3EP. <br> <strong> E-mail: </strong> <a href=\"mailto:bookings@royaltroon.com\">bookings@royaltroon.com</a> </p> <p><strong> North Berwick</strong><br> Another old Scottish course that is laid out seemingly in the only way possible - following precisely the contours of the land, which happen to be just perfect for golf. It has a famous last hole, a drivable par four, which features a green raised rather like a cake tin, throwing any ball not perfectly struck off into the grassy swales that surround the green. This natural outcrop has been copied by designers worldwide, mostly inappropriately. There is not enough room on the course for large crowds to follow play, so although an Open is out of the question, one of the final qualifying rounds is always played there when the Open goes to Muirfield. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> 24 for men, 34 for women. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> Weekdays \u00a336 a round, \u00a354 a day, weekends \u00a354 a round, \u00a372 a day. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Full catering. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01620 892135 from 11am on. If no answer or engaged, try the pro's shop on 01620 893233. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Can't get out before 10am. <br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \u00a31.65. <br> <strong> Address: </strong> The Glen Golf Club, Tantallon Terrace, North Berwick EH39 4LE. </p> <p><strong> Machrihanish</strong><br> Mention this one to an aficionado and they'll start drooling at once, picturing a wild, windswept landscape and a links to die for. It's remote enough, even these days, situated on the Mull of Kintyre, near Campbelltown, but few who've been there moan about a wasted journey. If you take the car, it takes a long time to get there - about three hours from Glasgow - but it's only 25 minutes by air and, either way, you'll enjoy some stunning scenery. It's not advis able to rush on to the first tee without warming up. The view of the bay and the beach is fantastic but the drive is daunting, tempting the brave, or foolhardy, to take too direct a line over the sea. Old Tom Morris, a pioneer of the game, said the Almighty had designed Machrihanish for playing golf. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> None, just as long as you can play. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> \u00a328 a round, \u00a345 a day, except Saturday, \u00a335 a round, \u00a355 a day. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Catering available 11am-3pm, 6pm on. Also rolls, soup etc. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01586 810213. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Not many. Pretty easy going. Tee times from 9am on. <br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \u00a31.75. <br> <strong> Address: </strong> Machrihanish Golf Club, Machrihanish, Campbeltown, Argyll PA28 6PT. </p> <p><strong> Boat of Garten</strong><br> It's not a great course - Tiger Woods would probably consider it a pitch and putt, with only four holes longer than 400 yards - but that's not a problem for most of us. The Boat is a great place to be and to play and that's what stays in the memory. It's the sort of course that will still be a favourite 30 years after your only visit. It's a handful of miles north of Aviemore, so there's the river Spey, the Cairngorms, pine trees, perhaps the odd osprey and enough undulations and variety to test your shot-making. A gem and a delight. </p> <p> <strong> Handicap certificate: </strong> Should have a handicap but no certificate necessary. <br> <strong> Green fees: </strong> Weekdays \u00a323 a round, \u00a328 a day. Weekends \u00a328 a round, \u00a333 a day. <br> <strong> Eating: </strong> Catering 9am-8pm. <br> <strong> Booking: </strong> 01479 831282. <br> <strong> Restrictions: </strong> Booking system, otherwise not many. <br> <strong> Pint of lager: </strong> \"Haven't a clue, Never look at prices when I buy a drink.

Handicap certificate: 18 for men, 24 for women. Must be members of a recognised golf club. Green fees: \u00a380 a round, \u00a3105 a day. Eating: Gentleman can, ladies can't (in the clubhouse). Booking: 01620 842123. Restrictions: Tuesdays and Thursdays only. Probably have to book a year ahead. Books for 2001 opened on May 1, phone has hardly stopped ringing since. Women must play with men, one each (ie can't have three women and one man). Pint of lager: \u00a31.65. Address: Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, Muirfield, Gullane, East Lothian EH31 2EG. E-mail: hceg@btinternet.com Nairn This is one of those gems that until relatively recently has been unrecognised by the various championships. It is a magnificent test of golf, hard by the Moray Firth, with a glut of great holes. Because it is fairly exposed, it is subject to - and is the better for - a wind, that can blow severely. Nairn needs only a few more yards to be worthy of an Open. Handicap certificate: 28 for men, 36 for women. Green fees: Weekdays \u00a360 a round, weekends \u00a365 a round. Eating: Full catering. Booking: 01667 453208. Restrictions: Members' times 9am-9.30am. Four-balls after 9.30am. Some at weekends. Pint of lager: \u00a31.80-\u00a31.90. Address: The Nairn Golf Club, Seabank Road, Nairn IV12 4HB. Website: www.nairngolfclub.co.uk Royal Dornoch This is a place of pilgrimage, a long way even from Edinburgh or Glasgow. It is the most northerly championship course in the world, on the same latitude as Hudson Bay and Labrador. But, as the Michelin guides say, it is worth a detour as two players who arrived singly and were introduced on the first tee discovered. One had flown from New York to London to Inverness and then taxied to Dornoch; the other had driven from Birmingham and both had taken 10 hours. But they discovered a course that is a delight, wandering around the whins, the heather and the gorse in full accord with its surroundings. Tom Watson said of it: \"I have played none finer, a natural masterpiece.\" Handicap certificate: 24 for men, 39 for women. Green fees: Weekdays \u00a357 a round, weekends \u00a367 a round. Weekdays combination ticket \u00a362 for both courses. Eating: Full catering. Booking: 01862 810219. Restrictions: Saturday morning members only. Blocks of times for visitors but very busy mid-May to early October. Pint of lager: \u00a31.60-ish. Address: Royal Dornoch, Golf Road, Dornoch IV25 3LW. E-mail: www.royaldornoch.com Carnoustie This might have been purpose-built for the masochists of the golfing world. It is 7,371 yards long from the back tees and has a par of, wait for it, 71. It can be the hardest golf course in the world. Carnoustie is a brutal test even on a nice day and when, as so often occurs, the weather draws its great grey curtains, the bleakness of the surroundings can be overwhelming. The daunting nature of the course can be summed up in one word, and was when the comedian and singer Danny Kaye made the following entrance in the vistors' book: \"Murder,\" he wrote. The local council lost the plot in the 1970s and 80s, allowing the course to become a milked-out cash cow in clapped-out condition. It is restored now, so go and be proud if you get within five of your handicap. Handicap certificate: 28 for men, 36 for women. Green fees: \u00a370 all the time. Eating: Golf club or the hotel. Booking: 01241 853789. Restrictions: Weekends more difficult. After 2pm on Saturday, 11.30am on Sunday. Pint of lager: \u00a31.40-\u00a31.80. Address: Carnoustie Golf Links, Links Parade, Carnoustie, Angus DD7 7JE. Website: www.carnoustie.org/golf Royal Troon \"Royal\" was added to its name quite recently despite the fact that 50% of the world's population are not allowed on to the championship course. Women are expressly forbidden from playing there, presumably because they might strain themselves, poor dears. This barmy ban apart, Troon is a great place to play golf. The course runs out-and-back in the classical manner and, if the wind is from the north, the homeward half becomes monstrous. Handicap certificate: 20 for men, 30 for women (on the Portland course). Green fees: \u00a3125 a day, includes coffee/lunch and a round on both the Old and the Portland courses (women excepted). \u00a385 a day includes coffee/lunch and two rounds on the Portland course. Eating: Full catering, including Ailsa lounge, where you don't need to change and soft spikes (not hard) are permitted. In the dining room and smoke room, jacket and tie required. Booking: 01292 311555. Restrictions: Old 9.30am-11am and 2.30pm-4pm; Portland 9am-10.30am and 2.30pm-4pm. Women and players under 18 can play the Portland course. Women are not allowed to play the championship course but are permitted to \"accompany and look decorative\". Are they allowed in the clubhouse? Doubtless, on special occasions, under armed guard. Pint of lager: \u00a31.73. Address: Royal Troon Golf Club, Craigend Road, Troon, Ayshire KA10 3EP. E-mail: bookings@royaltroon.com North Berwick Another old Scottish course that is laid out seemingly in the only way possible - following precisely the contours of the land, which happen to be just perfect for golf. It has a famous last hole, a drivable par four, which features a green raised rather like a cake tin, throwing any ball not perfectly struck off into the grassy swales that surround the green. This natural outcrop has been copied by designers worldwide, mostly inappropriately. There is not enough room on the course for large crowds to follow play, so although an Open is out of the question, one of the final qualifying rounds is always played there when the Open goes to Muirfield. Handicap certificate: 24 for men, 34 for women. Green fees: Weekdays \u00a336 a round, \u00a354 a day, weekends \u00a354 a round, \u00a372 a day. Eating: Full catering. Booking: 01620 892135 from 11am on. If no answer or engaged, try the pro's shop on 01620 893233. Restrictions: Can't get out before 10am. Pint of lager: \u00a31.65. Address: The Glen Golf Club, Tantallon Terrace, North Berwick EH39 4LE. Machrihanish Mention this one to an aficionado and they'll start drooling at once, picturing a wild, windswept landscape and a links to die for. It's remote enough, even these days, situated on the Mull of Kintyre, near Campbelltown, but few who've been there moan about a wasted journey. If you take the car, it takes a long time to get there - about three hours from Glasgow - but it's only 25 minutes by air and, either way, you'll enjoy some stunning scenery. It's not advis able to rush on to the first tee without warming up. The view of the bay and the beach is fantastic but the drive is daunting, tempting the brave, or foolhardy, to take too direct a line over the sea. Old Tom Morris, a pioneer of the game, said the Almighty had designed Machrihanish for playing golf. Handicap certificate: None, just as long as you can play. Green fees: \u00a328 a round, \u00a345 a day, except Saturday, \u00a335 a round, \u00a355 a day. Eating: Catering available 11am-3pm, 6pm on. Also rolls, soup etc. Booking: 01586 810213. Restrictions: Not many. Pretty easy going. Tee times from 9am on. Pint of lager: \u00a31.75. Address: Machrihanish Golf Club, Machrihanish, Campbeltown, Argyll PA28 6PT. Boat of Garten It's not a great course - Tiger Woods would probably consider it a pitch and putt, with only four holes longer than 400 yards - but that's not a problem for most of us. The Boat is a great place to be and to play and that's what stays in the memory. It's the sort of course that will still be a favourite 30 years after your only visit. It's a handful of miles north of Aviemore, so there's the river Spey, the Cairngorms, pine trees, perhaps the odd osprey and enough undulations and variety to test your shot-making. A gem and a delight. Handicap certificate: Should have a handicap but no certificate necessary. Green fees: Weekdays \u00a323 a round, \u00a328 a day. Weekends \u00a328 a round, \u00a333 a day. Eating: Catering 9am-8pm. Booking: 01479 831282. Restrictions: Booking system, otherwise not many. Pint of lager: \"Haven't a clue, Never look at prices when I buy a drink. Club prices,\" said the steward. Address: Boat of Garten Golf and Tennis Club, Inverness-shire PH24 3BQ. Website: www.boatgolf.com \u0095 The Open Championship is on July 20-23.

      "body": "<p>The tourist officer looks uncomfortable. We are standing on the steps of her office, preparing to enter a pavilion where you can taste 10 different types of spring water, some fizzy, some still, some warm and smelling of rotten eggs, all constituted to neutralise bugs in your system. It is the town's chief attraction and has been pulling in consumptive pilgrims since Roman times. </p> <p>But Fran\u00e7oise is looking grim, because eschewing the water angle, I've asked her about the town's history as a base for Marshal P\u00e9tain's collaborationist government during the second world war. Given the scale of interest in the period, you'd expect coach-loads of A-level history students to be backed up all the way to Nice. </p> <p>\"Yes, the government buildings were here,\" she says, wearily indicating the tourist office behind us, \"and P\u00e9tain's private quarters were at the end of the block.\" </p> <p>Bit of an oversight by the tourist office, isn't it? No plaque? No museum? No wall of remembrance where you can lay a wreath to the victims of the Vichy regime? </p> <p>\"It's not a period we want to remember,\" she says and, looking suitably tortured, clips off across the road towards the curly white ironwork of the pavilion. </p> <p>The town's reluctance to put its more recent history to commercial or even educative use means that what you will find is a beautifully-manicured spa town with landscaped parks, perfectly-restored architecture and not a single reference to the war. </p> <p>Vichy is remarkable for being a town in which there appear to be no ugly bits. It is like a feature on a wedding cake, clean and sparkly, the beneficiary of 500 years' worth of investment by wealthy hypochondriacs. Napoleon III loved it and had two houses built there during the 1860s. The buildings are a mixture of art deco, gothic and baroque, with a 19th-century copy of the Venetian Gustinian building tucked away in a side-street, as if it was any other ordinary semi. </p> <p>One third of the town is made up of parkland, exquisite belle-\u00e9poque lawns dotted with old-fashioned iron gazebos and trees waving in the wind. </p> <p>While bigger centres in the region, such as Clermont Ferrand, boast nothing higher than three-star hotels, Vichy has a four-star stunner - Les C\u00e9lestins - with a rooftop swimming pool curled like an intestine so that half of it is inside and half out, with candy-striped sun loungers parked at the edge. </p> <p>For a hotel more in keeping with the style of the town, the Aletti Palace Hotel, built in 1911, has the understated chic of the Titanic. The reception, in the shadow of a terrifying crystal chandelier, is decorated in heavy red velour with a grand staircase whisking up from it like a tornado, and wooden panelling adorning the walls. </p> <p>Beautiful, airbrushed Vichy is in the Auvergne region of central France, an area characterised by 88 dormant volcanoes that give it a skyline more redolent of Costa Rica than somewhere within 90 minutes' flying time of London. Seen from the vantage point of a hot-air balloon, it is full of densely- vegetated lacunae and bleached stone villages with dinky steeples - a vista worth getting up for at 4am and parting with \u00a3150. </p> <p>For those who enjoy a more leisurely approach to taking in the scenery, a car-ride around the Auvergne will still get your heart rate up. It takes an hour to drive from Vichy to Clermont Ferrand, and another hour to hit the deep, soft countryside. But towards the small towns of Brioude and Langeac, you come across a perfect picture-postcard rendition of France - an avenue lined with plane trees. </p> <p>The village of Lavote-Chilhac perches on a rock with an 11th-century church, a fantastic restaurant - Le Prieur\u00e9, about \u00a310 a head - and two-star accommodation overlooking a stone bridge over the Gorge. It is a spot of such weird perfection that it is worth going out of your way for. </p> <p>Half-an-hour to the east is Le Puy en Velay, a larger-scale version of that same, ancient splendour. The cathedral, with its 13th-century fresco of the Crucifixion, made it the Lourdes of the middle ages, and it is still a major destination for pilgrimages. The winding streets are like something out of Shakespeare, since the authorities long ago stopped giving planning permission for anything modern looking. Three stars are as high as the hotels go, but luxurious accommodation seems less important with countryside this stunning. </p> <p><strong>Action in the Auvergne</strong></p> <p>From a terrestrial viewpoint, the best way to penetrate the Auvergne countryside is to book for some off-road activities. A day's mountain biking will cost \u00a313 (including bike hire), horse riding is from \u00a321 for half a day, and white-water rafting in the Gorges du Haut-Allier is \u00a329 for the day, or \u00a315 for the afternoon. </p> <p>At the Ecuries du Breuil, I was given Paddy,a brown and very docile horse. The 30km trek went along wooded tracks, across hills and streams, from which I could see endless scooped out mountains and rippling fields. </p> <p>The riding was idyllic: better than walking because you can see over the hedgerows; better than driving because there is no sound of an engine. The trips are tailored to experience and have a maximum of 15 people. </p> <p>Mountain biking was provided by Dome VTT, run by Eric Gire, who leads groups of around 10 on complicated routes through the Parc des Volcans. These involve skidding down steep, wooded inclines on an earth and shale track, doing BMX-style jumps over tree roots and stopping for breath in a valley surrounded by the husks of dead volcanoes, with red gravel slopes and towering pine trees of a kind regularly featured in the Fortean Times as likely spots for UFO sitings. </p> <p>To complete the set of activities, I attempted white-water rafting with the Tonic Adventure company. We were given wetsuits and paddles and told to sit on both sides of the squat yellow dingy and row. As we bombed through the white water, the scenery on either side of the rapids rose up like Montana's finest. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">Ryanair</a> (0870 333 1231) flies from Stansted to St Etienne from \u00a390 return.</p> <p><strong> Hotels:</strong> Les C\u00e9lestins, 111 Boulevard des Etats-Unis, Vichy (00 33 4 70 30 82 00) from \u00a3120 a night.

For those who enjoy a more leisurely approach to taking in the scenery, a car-ride around the Auvergne will still get your heart rate up. It takes an hour to drive from Vichy to Clermont Ferrand, and another hour to hit the deep, soft countryside. But towards the small towns of Brioude and Langeac, you come across a perfect picture-postcard rendition of France - an avenue lined with plane trees. The village of Lavote-Chilhac perches on a rock with an 11th-century church, a fantastic restaurant - Le Prieur\u00e9, about \u00a310 a head - and two-star accommodation overlooking a stone bridge over the Gorge. It is a spot of such weird perfection that it is worth going out of your way for. Half-an-hour to the east is Le Puy en Velay, a larger-scale version of that same, ancient splendour. The cathedral, with its 13th-century fresco of the Crucifixion, made it the Lourdes of the middle ages, and it is still a major destination for pilgrimages. The winding streets are like something out of Shakespeare, since the authorities long ago stopped giving planning permission for anything modern looking. Three stars are as high as the hotels go, but luxurious accommodation seems less important with countryside this stunning. Action in the Auvergne From a terrestrial viewpoint, the best way to penetrate the Auvergne countryside is to book for some off-road activities. A day's mountain biking will cost \u00a313 (including bike hire), horse riding is from \u00a321 for half a day, and white-water rafting in the Gorges du Haut-Allier is \u00a329 for the day, or \u00a315 for the afternoon. At the Ecuries du Breuil, I was given Paddy,a brown and very docile horse. The 30km trek went along wooded tracks, across hills and streams, from which I could see endless scooped out mountains and rippling fields. The riding was idyllic: better than walking because you can see over the hedgerows; better than driving because there is no sound of an engine. The trips are tailored to experience and have a maximum of 15 people. Mountain biking was provided by Dome VTT, run by Eric Gire, who leads groups of around 10 on complicated routes through the Parc des Volcans. These involve skidding down steep, wooded inclines on an earth and shale track, doing BMX-style jumps over tree roots and stopping for breath in a valley surrounded by the husks of dead volcanoes, with red gravel slopes and towering pine trees of a kind regularly featured in the Fortean Times as likely spots for UFO sitings. To complete the set of activities, I attempted white-water rafting with the Tonic Adventure company. We were given wetsuits and paddles and told to sit on both sides of the squat yellow dingy and row. As we bombed through the white water, the scenery on either side of the rapids rose up like Montana's finest.

      "body": "<p>Locals like to call Cairo \"the Mother of the World\", but in fact the city is a whirlpool of life and culture on the edge of many worlds - Upper and Lower Egypt, Asia and arid north Africa, the Mediterranean and tropical Africa, the desert and the sown. You can peel layers off the city's history like an onion skin, for almost anyone who was anyone in the business of conquest has been here at some time or another. </p> <p>The fortress-city of Al-Qahira was built by a heretical Arab clan called the Fatimids in 969AD, but millennia earlier the area had been a centre for pharaonic civilisation. Heliopolis - a suburb of modern Cairo - was the headquarters of the mysterious Ra brotherhood, who were the secret power behind the ancient Egyptian throne, while the Giza plateau, with its pyramids and Great Sphinx, was their most sacred site. </p> <p>The Persians arrived in 525BC, bringing the hitherto unknown camel with them, followed by Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs, Mamluks, Turks, French and British. Each band of newcomers has added new ingredients to the heady stockpot of history still simmering alongside the modern office blocks, bridges and flyovers. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> Tahrir Square is the centre of Downtown Cairo, and the site of one of the city's greatest attractions, the Egyptian Museum - an Edwardian baroque palace in red sandstone housing the best exhibition of ancient Egyptian relics anywhere in the world. It really requires more than one visit to do it justice, but for those with a limited time the Tutankhamen treasures are probably the principal highlight. Discovered by Howard Carter in 1921, the three golden catafalques, solid gold death-mask, ceremonial gilded couches and chariots, jewellery, scarabs, diadems, weapons, statues and more than 1,600 other items were buried with an 18th-dynasty boy-king. </p> <p>The museum houses more than 100,000 relics and is open every day (9am-4.45pm) except for a two-hour break for prayers (noon-2pm) on Friday. The admission fee of about \u00a33.50 is good value, and students pay only \u00a31.75, though admission to the royal mummies room is an extra \u00a37. </p> <p><strong> The pyramids</strong><br> </p> <p> No one visits Cairo without seeing the pyramids at Giza, of course, and no matter how many times you have seen them in films and pictures, at close hand these colossal structures remain stunningly impressive. There are three giant pyramids at Giza, built with a precision that even today is the envy of engineers. </p> <p>No one knows for certain when the pyramids and Sphinx were built, nor what their purpose was. But with visitors to Egypt now back to almost two million a year, and most of them paying \u00a33.50 for admission to the Giza necropolis and a further \u00a33.50 to enter each of the three pyramids, one wonders if the original builders weren't inspired by an entrepreneurial genius that was millennia ahead of its time. </p> <p><strong> Shopping and how to haggle</strong><br> </p> <p> Visit the warren of bazaars of Khan al-Khalili and you will have stepped into the One Thousand and One Nights. The bazaar grew up organically around a caravanserai built to serve camel-caravans from Persia and China in the 14th century, and many of its buildings and gateways still date from that era. Within the maze of winding, narrow alleys, you can find brassware, Bedouin jewellery, carpets, gold, glass, incense, leatherwork, perfumes, papyrus, silver, precious stones, spices and textiles. </p> <p>Although some shops display \"fixed price\" signs, haggling has always been the true order of things in the bazaar. Most merchants enjoy the cut-and-thrust of bargaining and have scant respect for anyone who promptly pays what is asked. </p> <p>As a general rule, offer about two-thirds of the original asking price and end up paying somewhere half way between the merchant's first price and your own. Don't be afraid to walk away - there is plenty of competition and you may always get the same thing cheaper elsewhere. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> All of the more expensive hotels have good restaurants, but for something more local there is Felfela's (392 2751) - walking distance from the Nile Hilton, on Hoda Shaarawi street - which offers traditional Egyptian dishes such as stuffed vine-leaves, fuul beans, roast pigeon, grilled aubergines with olive oil. Dinner with beer or wine can cost as little as \u00a35. </p> <p><strong> What to do out of town</strong><br> </p> <p> The Cairo camel market at Birqash, about 35km northwest of the city centre, is reachable by taxi. The market - probably the largest camel souq in the world - symbolises the secret world of the desert, hidden behind the luxuriance of the Nile Valley. Egypt has few camels of its own, and virtually all the animals you will see at Birqash are brought on the hoof from the Sudan - more than 1,000 miles across the desert - by an ancient caravan route known as the Forty Days Road. The market flourishes most in the early mornings, and admission is about 20p per person, 10p for a camera and about \u00a32.50 for a video camera. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> Many of Cairo's hotels are part of the city's rich historical fabric. </p> <p>Standing almost in the shadow of the pyramids, the <strong> Mena Palace Oberoi</strong> (383 3444) at Giza is where Winston Churchill, Lawrence of Arabia and others met in 1920 to decide the future of the Middle East. Originally an early 19th-century hunting lodge, it was converted into a hotel by an eccentric British couple, Hugh and Ethel Locke-King, who also created the famous golf course where crowned heads of Europe once practised their strokes. In 1915, the then Prince of Wales is said to have driven a golf ball on to one of its greens from the top of the second pyramid nearby. Single rooms cost about \u00a3146, doubles about \u00a3120pp including breakfast. </p> <p>Shepheard's is another famous name - used as an HQ by Napoleon himself, and later the unofficial officers' mess of British forces in both the first and second world wars. The present <strong> Helnan Shepheard</strong> (355 3800), standing on the Nile Corniche near Tahrir Square, is not on the original site, but still conjures up something of the atmosphere of Victorian Cairo. Singles cost about \u00a395 a night, doubles at \u00a375pp. </p> <p>The <strong> Semiramis InterContinental </strong> (355 3020) next door is a late 20th-century incarnation of another famous turn-of-the-century hotel that stood on the same site, but which now gives precedence to comfort rather than character. Rated as one of the city's top watering places, it is currently offering an excellent value weekend saver package at \u00a375pp. </p> <p>A little further up the Corniche is one of the best known of Cairo's modern inns, the <strong> Nile Hilton</strong> (578 0444), standing where the notoriously flea-ridden British barracks of Qasr an-Nil once stood, and offering somewhat more salubrious accommodation at \u00a3188 for singles, \u00a3135pp for doubles. The Hilton's coffee-shop terrace is one of the most pleasant places in the city to smoke a shisha , or waterpipe, and to drink a coffee or a beer, though it has a minimum charge of \u00a34.50 per person. The hotel also boasts an excellent restaurant, Da Mario, offering pasta dishes at around \u00a33.50. </p> <p>The blade-shaped tower of the <strong> Ramses Hilton</strong> (574 4400) was designed so that every room has a breath-taking view over the city. Single rooms cost about \u00a3114, doubles about \u00a377pp. </p> <p>More basic but full of character is the <strong> Garden City House </strong> (354 4969). Rooms range from about \u00a311-\u00a318 with shared bathroom, and about \u00a313-\u00a320 with bath, including breakfast and dinner. </p> <p>For something really downmarket, there is the <strong> Dahab Hotel</strong> (579 4400) in Mahmoud Bassiouni street, which offers huts on a rooftop, Arab-style floor cushions and bamboo screens. Doubles with private showers cost about \u00a37. </p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong><br> </p> <p> If you book before the end of this month, Trailfinders (020-7938 3939) offers Lufthansa return flights via Frankfurt for \u00a3236. British Airways (0845 7733377) offers direct scheduled flights from Heathrow for \u00a3352.10 inc tax.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Asher's new Cairo-based thriller, Firebird, is published on Monday by HarperCollins at \u00a316.99.</p>",

Singles cost about \u00a395 a night, doubles at \u00a375pp. The Semiramis InterContinental (355 3020) next door is a late 20th-century incarnation of another famous turn-of-the-century hotel that stood on the same site, but which now gives precedence to comfort rather than character. Rated as one of the city's top watering places, it is currently offering an excellent value weekend saver package at \u00a375pp. A little further up the Corniche is one of the best known of Cairo's modern inns, the Nile Hilton (578 0444), standing where the notoriously flea-ridden British barracks of Qasr an-Nil once stood, and offering somewhat more salubrious accommodation at \u00a3188 for singles, \u00a3135pp for doubles. The Hilton's coffee-shop terrace is one of the most pleasant places in the city to smoke a shisha , or waterpipe, and to drink a coffee or a beer, though it has a minimum charge of \u00a34.50 per person. The hotel also boasts an excellent restaurant, Da Mario, offering pasta dishes at around \u00a33.50. The blade-shaped tower of the Ramses Hilton (574 4400) was designed so that every room has a breath-taking view over the city. Single rooms cost about \u00a3114, doubles about \u00a377pp. More basic but full of character is the Garden City House (354 4969). Rooms range from about \u00a311-\u00a318 with shared bathroom, and about \u00a313-\u00a320 with bath, including breakfast and dinner. For something really downmarket, there is the Dahab Hotel (579 4400) in Mahmoud Bassiouni street, which offers huts on a rooftop, Arab-style floor cushions and bamboo screens. Doubles with private showers cost about \u00a37. How to get there If you book before the end of this month, Trailfinders (020-7938 3939) offers Lufthansa return flights via Frankfurt for \u00a3236. British Airways (0845 7733377) offers direct scheduled flights from Heathrow for \u00a3352.10 inc tax. \u00b7 Michael Asher's new Cairo-based thriller, Firebird, is published on Monday by HarperCollins at \u00a316.99.",

We declare the number of coupons assessed for every company in every category: the scoring system and the thresholds are made clear. Nothing is hidden or disguised. Just less than 17,000 questionnaires were completed. Readers were asked to name the companies they travelled with and to rate the quality of the service they received by ticking one of four boxes: excellent, good, fair or poor. We scored these results giving three points for excellent, two for good and one for fair - poor was zero-rated. Each total score was divided by the number of coupons received for that company and this fi Best Travel Company The tranquillity of the smaller Greek islands as delivered by Laskarina continues to hold Observer and Guardian readers in its thrall. This is the fifth year that this family-run Derbyshire-based company has won the main title with astonishingly high satisfaction scores (no fewer than 112 of the 126 Laskarina clients who completed coupons rated their holiday as excellent).

Simple, unfussy layout, excellent price panels with minimum of supplements. Clean, with a rare example of clear symbols. We liked especially the \"meatless &amp; fancy free in Paris\" symbol. A little gem. Commended: Magic Cities Also short-listed: Abercrombie &amp; Kent Weekends and Beyond, Marriott Leisure Breaks and Simply Cities. Long haul Winner: Sunsail Yes, it does have some British and European holidays but it is a new worldwide brochure. Good index page and interesting use of the layout grid. It gave a real sense of the holiday experience: clearly run by people who understand sailing. Also short-listed: Cazenove &amp; Loyd, Cox &amp; Kings, Exodus and Seasons in the Sun. Skiing Winner: Mark Warner Great feel of place from the images. The resort details were good and came with piste maps. An unfortunate cover with little impact but the open ing spreads gave a clear feel of the type of holiday being sold. The pricing was clear. Non-skiing families would also feel confident that this company knew what it was doing. Understated branding - perhaps rightly banking on the strength of the brand. Also short-listed: Flexiski, Meriski, Ski Safari and the Ski Company. Special interest Winner: High Places The recycled paper was just right for this brochure - and yet the images came out nicely. Wonderful fit of design and content on a budget. It worked to a grid but managed to vary the pattern. The testimonials were all the better for being attributed. A lot of ground is covered without complication thanks to the clear navigation. Also short-listed: Bloomfield Rainforest Lodge, Dragoman, Hebridean Princess and Yes Iceland. Summer Winner: Eurocamp Brilliant cover that skips straight into the theme of family holidays. The early pages explain the concept, leaving no doubt about what is being sold. Children will love the symbols and it is they who will force the holiday decision for camping. The gatefold is a superb tool for adults planning a self-drive holiday. Exciting. Also short-listed: Mark Hammerton's Family Camping in France, The Greek Islands (Greek Sun), Tapestry Turkey and VFB's Cottage Holidays in France. Mass market Winner: Kuoni Tropical Sun It dared to be different from the usual Kuoni approach. Also ready to break the design mould with pictures on right and text on left. Clich\u00e9d, but aimed at target audience. An easier job than the big summer \"bible\" brochures but a job well done. Also short-listed: Cadogan Collection, JMC Summer Sun, Thomson's Just and Unijet Summer Sun. Website Winner: www.visitbritain.com This was a site designed directly for the web with a unique search engine. The British Tourist Authority must be commended for seizing the opportunity to use the new medium to spread its message. The links were good but the search engine was slow on home lines. The design was clean and the messages clear. The foreign language translations were sometimes schoolboyish but a great attempt that can only get better. Also short-listed: www.leski.co.uk, www.markhammerton.com, www.regal-diving.co.uk, www.wallacearnold.co.uk",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is the Caribbean and the English countryside, Antarctica and California, Sydney and Gleneagles all rolled into one. It is the department store of holidays, promising everything you could want under one, clear sky. </p> <p>Like any good store, some of the lines are tried and trusted and none more so than the brochure's promise to transport tourists back to the England of the 1950s. For years, the clich\u00e9d view of New Zealand was that the green hills and polite, provincial manners combined to provide a kind of heritage themepark for the nostalgic Brit. </p> <p>Go-ahead, modern Kiwis - particularly those on the North Island - loathe that idea, of course. They insist NZ has become a cool, Pacific nation looking forward towards Asia rather than back to the old country. They're mostly right, but the British influence has not vanished completely. The South Island still boasts towns called Middlemarch, Cromwell and Palmerston, while Christchurch might have been prised out of the Home Counties and air-dropped from the sky. </p> <p>Even the trendier North Island has reminders of the first settlers' country of origin. Head east out of Auckland, around the Firth of Thames and into the Coromandel Peninsula, and you'll see enough hills, valleys and sheep to remind you of the Scotland or Wales that the pioneers left behind. </p> <p>In Auckland itself, you can sample a taste of home by bedding down at the Aachen House, a boutique hotel built in Edwardian style in 1913 for an English doctor. The chintzy bedrooms, sunny conservatory and warm hospitality will remind you of the best of Blighty. </p> <p>But nostalgia-travel is not what it used to be, at least as far as being the top-selling product in the NZ holiday-shop. In the past decade, the country has cultivated an altogether different lure for a new generation of traveller, becoming the number-one playground for danger-junkies. On the backpacker circuit, Queenstown on the South Island has become an essential stop - the place where gap-year daredevils try their hand at paragliding, tandem-parachuting or extreme sports that promise a face-to-face encounter with the Grim Reaper. </p> <p>A special badge of honour is reserved for those who have notched up the Awesome Foursome: bungee jumping, skydiving, whitewater rafting and zorbing. (For the uninitiated, to zorb involves being strapped inside a giant plastic ball and rolled down a hill, hurtling at such breakneck speeds that gravity plasters your body against the sides.) </p> <p>For those who don't fancy the taste of their own heart between their teeth as they careen in a jet-powered boat through an inches-wide canyon, NZ has often seemed like an afterthought, a bolt-on extra to Australia, only worth visiting if there's time. </p> <p>But that is to forget the country's role as the variety pack of holiday destinations, with a little bit for everyone. If a beach vacation is your thing, for example, look no further. NZ, with its long, thin, banana shape, has just short of 10,000 miles of coastline - shared between just 3.8 million people. The result is a land of empty, pristine beaches, a place where you can find a stretch of fine sand and clear water, spread out your towel - and not see a soul all day. </p> <p>And the beaches are not all the same. In the Coromandel, you can leave behind the tourists on Waihi beach, take a half-hour walk high up in the mountain bush and descend on to Orokawa, site of an ancient gold mine where the sea crashes and curls with white surf, as if in a sound-and-light display. </p> <p>Or you can head in the opposite direction and see the shore from a whole new angle - from the top of a horse. An hour's drive west out of Auckland takes you to Muriwai Beach, where a couple of gentle mares can be yours for a morning's canter, courtesy of the local riding centre. Don't worry if you're new in the saddle: the horses are blessed with an intuitive gearbox that makes them amble along at strolling speed - if that's what you want. Once you are ready to pick up the pace, they will sense it - galloping through the surf and racing over the flats of black sand that glitter in the daylight, as if embedded with precious jewels. </p> <p>A couple of hours are exhilarating, not just for the thighs but also on the eyes. Close by Muriwai Beach is a gannet colony and a famed stretch of surfing water: whichever exotic creature you enjoy watching, there's a perfect view from here. </p> <p>But no self-respecting beach-hunters will ever forgive themselves if they leave it at that. They'll want to take the coastal road a tad further south and make for Karekare. It may be on the other side of the world, but you would recognise it immediately. For Karekare was the location of perhaps the most memorable movie beach scene since Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr rolled around in From Here to Eternity. It was here that Holly Hunter was washed up, along with child and beloved instrument, in The Piano. </p> <p>You can see why New Zealand-born director Jane Campion dragged her entire cast and crew down the tiny, windy roads and sharp hillsides to reach Karekare. The beach is impossibly wide and almost absurdly beautiful - not in a picture-postcard way, but with a rugged, austere grandeur. The sand is dark and stretches the length of a football pitch before it touches the ocean. The cliffs are sheer and stark, the rocks bold and craggy - one curve forms a natural bay that the locals call The Cauldron, where the surf crashes and roars like hellfire. Visit here in early January, the height of the summer season, and you will be able to run, whirl and even dance on the sand without embarrassment because you will have the whole, magical place to yourselves. </p> <p>If that does not satisfy the appetite for sun and sea, South Island has some jewels of its own. Most Kiwis rarely take the short flight between the two islands, so the south is more roomy and unspoiled. For an absolute pearl, the destination ought to be the Abel Tasman National Park. </p> <p>This corner of the coast has been entirely preserved from development, some of its bays and inlets accessible only on foot or by boat. The result is an area that, if it were anywhere else in the world, would have been over-run long ago with hotels, nightclubs and beachside restaurants - but which is virginally untouched. You can spend a day sea-kayaking from one natural lagoon to another, or hiking along the bush trail, encountering no sign of tourism other than your own good self. </p> <p>Now a clutch of eco-friendly tour operators arrange three- or five-day trips through the Abel Tasman park - with guides who will show a novice couple how to steer and paddle a two-person canoe in the ocean or simply navigate your path through the thick, dense bush. Either option is magnificent, whether it is the satisfaction of docking the boat on a deserted beachside or scaling a hillside crowded with silver ferns before reaching a perfect view. </p> <p>A spot such as Torrent Bay would look quite at home in a Caribbean brochure of paradise island beaches, complete as it is with turquoise blue water and bone-white sand. </p> <p>To add to the appeal for the non-backpacker, the family-run Abel Tasman National Park Enterprises has a string of ultra-comfortable lodges along the coast - so you can unwind with a glass of New Zealand chardonnay while a first-rate chef rustles up dinner. Like NZ itself, Abel Tasman offers two kinds of holiday - adventure and luxury - in one. </p> <p>The choice does not end there. If a California-style trip is your thing, NZ has it covered. Outside Auckland, whose wharfside fish restaurants and sushi bars would not be out of place in San Diego, there are plenty of towns such as Titirangi - funky, granola communities where the organic caf\u00e9s jostle for space with the new age health stores. On South Island, you can stroll down Nelson's Trafalgar Street which, despite the name, owes more to San Francisco than to SW1. Here the vegetarian eateries, stripy sweaters and green awareness meetings would make any Californian feel at home. NZ even has its own Pacific Coast Highway - not quite the same as Route 1 from LA, but with views of pelican colonies and native wildlife that are just as spectacular. </p> <p>But perhaps the closest connection with California is the wine. Like South Africa or Australia, NZ has a thriving wine industry specialising in the light, warm taste of the new world. For a tourist, there can be few more joyful ways to pass a day than with a visit to, say, the Neudorf vineyard outside Nelson. Anyone is welcome to take a table in the garden, spread out a picnic and turn their face toward the sun - and their nostrils toward the grapes ripening all around. It is an idyllic spot, matched only by the prospect of dinner around the corner in Mapua - at a local legend of a restaurant called Nature Smoke, right on the water. There, naturally, smoked fish and seafood served with fresh vegetables are washed down with local wines. Get there early, to guarantee a table and enjoy the sunshine. </p> <p>If it is mountains that you're after, South Island has a range larger than the French, Austrian and Swiss Alps combined, while the North has its very own volcanic region (to say nothing of the geysers and hot springs of Rotorua). Add to that the fjords, glaciers, lakes and rainforests, and you should always have plenty to admire. </p> <p>Even the political tourist has reason to visit New Zealand: the country now has a radical left-wing, pro-republican government that is fulfilling all its promises while remaining popular. Now that, surely, is worth travelling across the world to see.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.purenz.com\">Tourism New Zealand</a>: The best time to visit is during the British winter.</p> <p>Air New Zealand (02087412299) offers return flights from Heathrow to Auckland or Christchurch, via Los Angeles, with optional stop-over, costs from \u00a3718 inc tax.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.neudorf.co.nz\">Neudorf Vineyards</a>, Neudorf Road, Upper Moutere, Nelson (tel: 64 3 543 2643)<br> Muriwai Beach Riding Centre, Muriwai Beach (tel: 64 9 411 8480).<br> Abel Tasman National Park Enterprises, PO Box 351, Motueka, Nelson (tel: 64 3 5287801).</p> <p>Aachen House hotel, 39 Market Road, Remuera, Auckland (tel: 64 9 520 2329), rooms from NZ$150<br><a href=\"http://www.rutherfordhotel.co.nz\">Copthorne Rutherford Hotel</a>, Trafalgar Square, Nelson (tel:64 3 5482299) rooms from $122.</p>",

Head east out of Auckland, around the Firth of Thames and into the Coromandel Peninsula, and you'll see enough hills, valleys and sheep to remind you of the Scotland or Wales that the pioneers left behind. In Auckland itself, you can sample a taste of home by bedding down at the Aachen House, a boutique hotel built in Edwardian style in 1913 for an English doctor. The chintzy bedrooms, sunny conservatory and warm hospitality will remind you of the best of Blighty. But nostalgia-travel is not what it used to be, at least as far as being the top-selling product in the NZ holiday-shop. In the past decade, the country has cultivated an altogether different lure for a new generation of traveller, becoming the number-one playground for danger-junkies. On the backpacker circuit, Queenstown on the South Island has become an essential stop - the place where gap-year daredevils try their hand at paragliding, tandem-parachuting or extreme sports that promise a face-to-face encounter with the Grim Reaper. A special badge of honour is reserved for those who have notched up the Awesome Foursome: bungee jumping, skydiving, whitewater rafting and zorbing. (For the uninitiated, to zorb involves being strapped inside a giant plastic ball and rolled down a hill, hurtling at such breakneck speeds that gravity plasters your body against the sides.) For those who don't fancy the taste of their own heart between their teeth as they careen in a jet-powered boat through an inches-wide canyon, NZ has often seemed like an afterthought, a bolt-on extra to Australia, only worth visiting if there's time. But that is to forget the country's role as the variety pack of holiday destinations, with a little bit for everyone. If a beach vacation is your thing, for example, look no further. NZ, with its long, thin, banana shape, has just short of 10,000 miles of coastline - shared between just 3.8 million people. The result is a land of empty, pristine beaches, a place where you can find a stretch of fine sand and clear water, spread out your towel - and not see a soul all day. And the beaches are not all the same. In the Coromandel, you can leave behind the tourists on Waihi beach, take a half-hour walk high up in the mountain bush and descend on to Orokawa, site of an ancient gold mine where the sea crashes and curls with white surf, as if in a sound-and-light display. Or you can head in the opposite direction and see the shore from a whole new angle - from the top of a horse. An hour's drive west out of Auckland takes you to Muriwai Beach, where a couple of gentle mares can be yours for a morning's canter, courtesy of the local riding centre. Don't worry if you're new in the saddle: the horses are blessed with an intuitive gearbox that makes them amble along at strolling speed - if that's what you want. Once you are ready to pick up the pace, they will sense it - galloping through the surf and racing over the flats of black sand that glitter in the daylight, as if embedded with precious jewels. A couple of hours are exhilarating, not just for the thighs but also on the eyes. Close by Muriwai Beach is a gannet colony and a famed stretch of surfing water: whichever exotic creature you enjoy watching, there's a perfect view from here. But no self-respecting beach-hunters will ever forgive themselves if they leave it at that. They'll want to take the coastal road a tad further south and make for Karekare. It may be on the other side of the world, but you would recognise it immediately. For Karekare was the location of perhaps the most memorable movie beach scene since Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr rolled around in From Here to Eternity. It was here that Holly Hunter was washed up, along with child and beloved instrument, in The Piano. You can see why New Zealand-born director Jane Campion dragged her entire cast and crew down the tiny, windy roads and sharp hillsides to reach Karekare. The beach is impossibly wide and almost absurdly beautiful - not in a picture-postcard way, but with a rugged, austere grandeur. The sand is dark and stretches the length of a football pitch before it touches the ocean. The cliffs are sheer and stark, the rocks bold and craggy - one curve forms a natural bay that the locals call The Cauldron, where the surf crashes and roars like hellfire. Visit here in early January, the height of the summer season, and you will be able to run, whirl and even dance on the sand without embarrassment because you will have the whole, magical place to yourselves. If that does not satisfy the appetite for sun and sea, South Island has some jewels of its own. Most Kiwis rarely take the short flight between the two islands, so the south is more roomy and unspoiled. For an absolute pearl, the destination ought to be the Abel Tasman National Park. This corner of the coast has been entirely preserved from development, some of its bays and inlets accessible only on foot or by boat. The result is an area that, if it were anywhere else in the world, would have been over-run long ago with hotels, nightclubs and beachside restaurants - but which is virginally untouched. You can spend a day sea-kayaking from one natural lagoon to another, or hiking along the bush trail, encountering no sign of tourism other than your own good self. Now a clutch of eco-friendly tour operators arrange three- or five-day trips through the Abel Tasman park - with guides who will show a novice couple how to steer and paddle a two-person canoe in the ocean or simply navigate your path through the thick, dense bush. Either option is magnificent, whether it is the satisfaction of docking the boat on a deserted beachside or scaling a hillside crowded with silver ferns before reaching a perfect view. A spot such as Torrent Bay would look quite at home in a Caribbean brochure of paradise island beaches, complete as it is with turquoise blue water and bone-white sand. To add to the appeal for the non-backpacker, the family-run Abel Tasman National Park Enterprises has a string of ultra-comfortable lodges along the coast - so you can unwind with a glass of New Zealand chardonnay while a first-rate chef rustles up dinner. Like NZ itself, Abel Tasman offers two kinds of holiday - adventure and luxury - in one. The choice does not end there. If a California-style trip is your thing, NZ has it covered. Outside Auckland, whose wharfside fish restaurants and sushi bars would not be out of place in San Diego, there are plenty of towns such as Titirangi - funky, granola communities where the organic caf\u00e9s jostle for space with the new age health stores. On South Island, you can stroll down Nelson's Trafalgar Street which, despite the name, owes more to San Francisco than to SW1. Here the vegetarian eateries, stripy sweaters and green awareness meetings would make any Californian feel at home. NZ even has its own Pacific Coast Highway - not quite the same as Route 1 from LA, but with views of pelican colonies and native wildlife that are just as spectacular. But perhaps the closest connection with California is the wine. Like South Africa or Australia, NZ has a thriving wine industry specialising in the light, warm taste of the new world. For a tourist, there can be few more joyful ways to pass a day than with a visit to, say, the Neudorf vineyard outside Nelson. Anyone is welcome to take a table in the garden, spread out a picnic and turn their face toward the sun - and their nostrils toward the grapes ripening all around. It is an idyllic spot, matched only by the prospect of dinner around the corner in Mapua - at a local legend of a restaurant called Nature Smoke, right on the water. There, naturally, smoked fish and seafood served with fresh vegetables are washed down with local wines. Get there early, to guarantee a table and enjoy the sunshine. If it is mountains that you're after, South Island has a range larger than the French, Austrian and Swiss Alps combined, while the North has its very own volcanic region (to say nothing of the geysers and hot springs of Rotorua). Add to that the fjords, glaciers, lakes and rainforests, and you should always have plenty to admire. Even the political tourist has reason to visit New Zealand: the country now has a radical left-wing, pro-republican government that is fulfilling all its promises while remaining popular. Now that, surely, is worth travelling across the world to see. The practicals Tourism New Zealand: The best time to visit is during the British winter.

Synthetic rather than down insulation keeps the price low. So it's the coming thing? Retailers say they're walking out of the shops. What else is new? Baffles. Top-of-the-range bags from Rab, Mountain Equipment and Mountain Hardware have variously-shaped baffles, which keep the goose down well spread out. Lots of \"fillpower\" and \"loft\" . Stop showing off. Fillpower measures the height of one ounce of down - 450 is about average, but the best bags have 700-plus. And loft? Loft means nice and puffy: it's the height off the floor when you pull it out of its stuffsack and lay it out. How much do the top ones knock you back? Between \u00a3300 and \u00a3370. But they keep you warm at 30 degrees below. I'm only going to Cornwall for the summer. Then pick a good all-rounder for about \u00a3100. Where do I get one? Specialist outdoor shops and chains: Cotswold and Field and Trek. Visit also www.snowandrock.com, www.rab.uk.com, www.sierra-designs.com, www.mountain-equipment.co.uk and www.mountainhardward.com. What's the alternative? A couple of blankets; a touch of hypothermia.",

      "body": "<p>A girl who looks no older than 15 stands on a street corner waiting for her next client. She is dressed in tight jeans and a skimpy top and wears heavy eyeliner and bright lipstick. No doubt, her pimp lurks nearby, ready to take the money she earns and in exchange to supply her with the drugs she craves. </p> <p>Not an uncommon sight in deprived inner cities across Britain. But this is no notorious red light district in London, Birmingham or Glasgow. The girl is working the streets of Swindon, one of Britain's most prosperous towns and a firm favourite with market researchers because it is perceived as home to a well-to-do Mr and Mrs Average, a place which reflects changing trends and attitudes. </p> <p>Beneath the Wiltshire town's comfortable exterior lies a serious and growing social problem. New figures reveal that the number of hard drug users in Swindon is on the increase. </p> <p>The price of heroin, in particular, has dropped sharply because so many dealers have descended on the town, realising it has a population with money to spend. And the sidelines which dealers inevitably have - such as drawing vulnerable teenagers into prostitution - are inevitably on the increase. </p> <p>It is because Swindon is perceived as an accurate gauge of prosperous Britain that the drugs problem there is so relevant. The trade in hard drugs and the associated social issues are no longer only an inner city problem but one which is facing communities across the country. One drugs worker said: \"Swindon is seen as a microcosm of the country, so if it is happening here, it is happening everywhere.\" </p> <p><strong> Disturbing trend</strong><br> </p> <p>The annual report of the Druglink, a Swindon charity which is often the first port of call for drug abusers, makes disturbing reading. It dealt with 2,500 \"clients\" last year, an increase of 600, or 30%, over the previous 12 months. </p> <p>Heroin was easily the most common drug new clients were taking, followed by amphetamines and then cannabis. The majority of younger users, Druglink found, were injecting rather than smoking heroin. And, perhaps most tellingly, of these new clients only one in five were homeless or lived in \"insecure\" accommodation. Most were from relatively secure homes. Michael Robinson, team leader of the community and drug and alcohol services in Swindon, has had experience of working with addicts in some of Britain's most challenging areas, including King's Cross and Brixton in London. On his arrival in Swindon a year ago, he discovered a contrasting, but no less worrying, picture. </p> <p>\"Swindon has very different drug problems,\" he said. \"There is nearly full employment and there are a lot of new housing estates. Many people we deal with here have jobs, homes and families. They may be working in factories or in the car industry. They have quite a lot of money and find that heroin is cheap and available - it is something to do.\" </p> <p>Over the past 10 years, business has boomed in Swindon. Blue chip firms flocked to the town, taking advantage of its transport links and forward-thinking local authority. Smart new estates continue to spring up, to house a growing and affluent populace, while the vibrant town centre bustles with shoppers with money to spend. Innovations such as eye recognition cash machines have been tested in the town because it is seen as so typical - albeit that some residents complain at being labelled average. In short, Swindon has come to stand as a symbol of prosperous New Britain. </p> <p>An examination of the town's relatively low crime figures supports the idea that a different type of drug user is to be found in Swindon. There are, for example, only two domestic burglaries per night in a community of some 200,000 people. </p> <p>Many of Swindon's drug users, or so it appears, do not need to commit crime to feed their habit because they already have the funds to buy drugs. </p> <p>Dave, 20, is one such. He works in a local car factory and lives with his girlfriend on one of the new estates in the west of the town. </p> <p>He said: \"I didn't really come across heroin when I was at school though there were other drugs we dabbled in - cannabis mainly, and ecstasy. </p> <p>\"It was after I had left and started work that myself and a group of friends began experimenting with it. I only smoked it, but some of the others began injecting. We would get it from a man in a pub. Everybody knew where to go. </p> <p>\"I was lucky that I never really took to it but some of my friends are in real trouble now. I know people who have lost everything because they have got into heroin. I came to realise that it could wreck my job, my relationships, my whole life, and managed to get out.\" </p> <p>Ten years ago, there was relatively little heroin in Swindon. Traditionally, amphetamines were the drug of choice, with the trade often overseen by motorcycle gangs. Fashions change and heroin use across the country is up. </p> <p>At the same time, competition continues to push the price of the drug down. Detective Inspector Bob Walton, of Swindon's crime reduction unit, says that five years ago, a 10th of a gram - one hit - cost up to \u00a315. Now the same amount can be bought for \u00a310. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, dealers have become more sophisticated. Gone are the days of huge heroin busts. Now dealers or couriers tend to make several journeys a week to cities such as Bristol or London and to pick up small amounts of heroin. </p> <p><strong> Transport links</strong><br> </p> <p>The dealers know that if they are caught, they are likely to face much shorter jail terms if they have only a small amount of the drug. It is, perhaps, ironic that one of the main reasons for heroin taking such a hold in Swindon is the town's transport links - a key factor in the rise in prosperity of the town's legitimate businesses. </p> <p>The human suffering which the drugs trade creates is starkly illustrated by the teenage girls lured into drug-taking and then prostitution by pimps and dealers. </p> <p>Druglink's report revealed that 11% of new female clients were under 18, and at the charity's annual conference last week, project manager Glenys Armstrong described how over the past year she had dealt with six young women aged between 14 and 17 who were working as prostitutes to fund drug habits. A representative of the charity Barnado's estimated at the conference that there could be 100 such young women working the streets of Swindon. </p> <p>Ms Armstrong said a typical scenario was that a teenager would fall out with her family - whether over friends, clothes, money or school work - and begin playing truant. She would be spotted hanging around the town by a drug-using pimp, who would impress her by taking her to pubs and clubs and buying her gifts - and drugs. The pimp would then, perhaps, say he owed money for the drugs he had supplied to her and coerce her into sleeping with someone to repay the supposed debt. </p> <p>Ms Armstrong said: \"By that stage she is isolated from her family and friends and dependent on drugs. If the girl tried to break away from the pimp, he threatened to tell her family what she had become involved in.\" </p> <p>There are few places in Swindon for young women - and others drawn into the world of drugs - to meet to receive support and help. One organisation at the sharp end is the Stepping Forward project, run with the help of national lottery funds from St John's church hall in Park North in the east of the town. </p> <p>Caroline Kelly, a specialist outreach worker at the project, began working as a volunteer with young drug users after discovering that her son was taking heroin. She was amazed to find that users had to wait months for treatment - last year some drug users in Swindon who had asked for help were waiting several months to be assessed for counselling and treatment - and then had nowhere to meet as they tried to piece their lives back together. </p> <p>Stepping Forward officially opened at the start of this year and it now caters for 60 youngsters aged 14 to 25 every week. They can spend their time playing pool or table tennis and they have access to computers. Those who need it can receive tutoring in reading and writing and other skills from visiting teachers. All receive counselling and support as they try to find a way back into society. </p> <p>The project is visited by youngsters from all sorts of backgrounds and with different problems. Some are from prosperous, stable families, while others, inevitably, have had more troubled upbringings and are hampered by lack of qualifications and life skills. Even in prosperous Swindon, some fall through the net. </p> <p>Peter, 24, for instance, describes how he has taken heroin and crack cocaine since the age of 15. Then, there were only one or two dealers on the streets. Now, he says, there are so many that they are fighting over their patches. They carry knives, and, he says, will soon be carrying guns. </p> <p>Peter, who is now on the heroin substitute methadone, says he had no idea what he was becoming involved in when he first took heroin. \"I used to smoke blow [cannabis] with a group of friends and then one day someone said, 'Try this brown stuff'. I thought it was another type of cannabis. When I realised that it was smack, it was too late - I was hooked.\" </p> <p><strong> Kicking the habit</strong><br> </p> <p>Since then he has been in and out of prison but is now determined to kick the drug habit. He shows how the needle tracks in his arms have healed. </p> <p>At Stepping Forward he is trying his hand at being a DJ on the centre's turn tables, which boom out dance music at deafening levels. The music and the optimism of the centre's visitors and inspirational staff make Stepping Out a welcoming place for the outsider. </p> <p>But the atmosphere changes subtly when a couple of teenage girls walk into the centre. Keeping their eyes to the ground, they speak quietly to a volunteer, then join friends tapping away at a computer. Tidy and fresh-faced, they look as if they should be worrying about homework or giggling with schoolmates about boyfriends. In fact, they are prostitutes. If market researchers are correct to tap into Swindon as an indicator of trends across the country, then its drugs problem is probably hitting, or is about to hit, other towns nationwide.</p>",

Peter, who is now on the heroin substitute methadone, says he had no idea what he was becoming involved in when he first took heroin. \"I used to smoke blow [cannabis] with a group of friends and then one day someone said, 'Try this brown stuff'. I thought it was another type of cannabis. When I realised that it was smack, it was too late - I was hooked.\" Kicking the habit Since then he has been in and out of prison but is now determined to kick the drug habit. He shows how the needle tracks in his arms have healed. At Stepping Forward he is trying his hand at being a DJ on the centre's turn tables, which boom out dance music at deafening levels. The music and the optimism of the centre's visitors and inspirational staff make Stepping Out a welcoming place for the outsider. But the atmosphere changes subtly when a couple of teenage girls walk into the centre. Keeping their eyes to the ground, they speak quietly to a volunteer, then join friends tapping away at a computer. Tidy and fresh-faced, they look as if they should be worrying about homework or giggling with schoolmates about boyfriends. In fact, they are prostitutes. If market researchers are correct to tap into Swindon as an indicator of trends across the country, then its drugs problem is probably hitting, or is about to hit, other towns nationwide.",

We reached the World Cup final in 1987 and 1992 and would regularly beat the likes of West Indies and Australia in the Texaco Trophy before getting slaughtered in the Tests. </p> <p>Back then we almost took our one-day success for granted, but now we are arguably even worse in the limited-overs format of the game than we are over five days. This is frustrating, particularly as we have the players to achieve success, at least on seaming wickets. There are plenty of excuses, but our continuing and baffling inability to select anything resembling our best side is driving me to breaking point. </p> <p>During the World Cup last year we consistently picked a side with five batsmen, four bowlers and two \"allrounders\". The idea of this was to create depth in the batting down to No. 7 and to give the captain the option of six bowlers. In practice it gives you a tail that starts at No. 6 and two bowlers that concede about seven an over. Despite the clear evidence that we do not have the players to pursue this tactic, the selectors persisted to pick these allrounders throughout the winter. </p> <p>The selectors also find it hard to grasp the fact that we patently do not have a spinner capable of succeeding in one-day cricket. Robert Croft had an initial honeymoon period as England's main spinner, but since '98 he has been carved around almost every time he has bowled. Ashley Giles is probably our best one-day spinner, but has yet to convince that he can bowl as tightly against world-class batsmen as proven seamers like Alan Mullally or Mark Ealham are able to do. As the next World Cup is in South Africa, where the wickets suit seam bowling, why do we need a spinner at all when the evidence suggests an all-seam attack would be more effective?</p> <p> We must surely play a team of specialists, with six batsmen and five seamers, rather than picking bits-and-pieces players like Adam Hollioake and Craig White who are simply inadequate with both bat and ball. Ealham has proved to be effective as a stock bowler, and can at least contribute from No.7 (he averages about 18). </p> <p> In order to play a team with six batsmen and five bowlers we must pick a wicketkeeper/batsman and, despite his age, Stewart is the only one we've got (resting him at the end of a gruelling winter tour would have been a good idea; dropping him was idiotic). He'll be 40 by the next World Cup, and we must pray he can continue until then. </p> <p>We must then decide who has done enough over the last 12 months to justify automatic selection. In the batting, probably Graeme Hick, Nick Knight and Nasser Hussain; of the bowlers, Darren Gough, Mullally and Andy Caddick have been consistent. </p> <p>So far, that's eight players who should be automatic selections.</p> <p>Although Graham Thorpe has been lacking form, passion and urgency of late, we can't afford not to select a player with his international record. Marcus Trescothick has been the most impressive one-day batsman in county cricket this year and has earned an opportunity. Finally Dominic Cork, who surely must be retained from the Test side after single-handedly defeating the West Indies, is at his best a proven high-class seamer who can score important runs. </p> <p>Of the five bowlers - Gough, Caddick, Mullally, Ealham and Cork - it is hard to imagine any of them getting smashed around. Indeed, the bowling has been our main (or only) strength over the last couple of years. The main weakness is the batting, particularly the middle/lower-middle order. With Stewart, Knight and Trescothick you have three natural openers who all have attacking games. You can then delay Hussain, Hick and Thorpe until Nos 4,5 and 6 to keep the momentum of the innings going. These three are also the best players of spin in the side and should reduce the extent of England's problem playing slow bowlers. </p> <p>If you compare my team with the current side, it is hard to believe that they wouldn't be far more effective in both departments, although we may have to accept we are behind other countries in terms of fielding. It is not a side picked around an idealistic vision of the perfect one-day team, but a selection that acknowledges the weaknesses of our players in certain areas and attempts to counter that with genuine ability by selecting the 11 best players. </p> <p> But then I am only a supporter, so what do I know?</p> <p> <strong>Nick Ryder's England one-day XI</strong></p> <p>Stewart (wk)<br> Knight <br> Trescothick <br> Hussain (c)<br> Hick <br> Thorpe <br> Ealham <br> Cork <br> Caddick <br> Gough <br> Mullally</p> <p><em>Nick Ryder, 22, is an IT network administrator from Chingford</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "QXL or Quicksell? What does it stand for? Good question. It used to be pronounced Quicksell, but the public didn't catch on. So you can call it Queue Ex Ell. Why are you blinking? I've been assailed by a sinus-inducing field of orange. \"HOT! HOT! HOT!\" shouts the headline. \"MOSCOW: 2 nights - The Spy Game - Mastertour - Heathrow - 22 September - \u00a3141.\" What does it all mean? QXL would like you to bid more than \u00a3141 for an autumn package trip to Moscow. This is an auction site for holidays and flights. The reserve price is reasonably low, but anyone can outbid you - if they do, QXL can send you an SMS message on your mobile to let you know - but if they don't, you may have a bargain. Before bidding, you have to entrust QXL with your credit card number and become a member. Any notable bargains? Disappointingly few, but there are hundreds of deals on offer. And you may spot something that has gone unnoticed by everyone else, particularly since many offers attract no bids at all. Will I get carried away? That depends on how susceptible you are. QXL relies on creating a sense of urgency among users. Once a bid is made, a legally-binding agreement is formed, so you can't change your mind. Oddity of the week Fielding's DangerFinder Dominated by a cackling skull, DangerFinder warns you of the dangers lying in wait for travellers to Peru, Uganda, Algeria and similarly troubled locations. It's all rather perverse and about as sincere as the skeleton's warnings at the entrance to a ghost train, but as a corrective to the rose-tinted delusions of the tourist industry, it deserves a look. \u0095 Nominate a travel oddity on the web by e-mailing: ros.taylor@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>There is a discreet reek of money and horse manure about the lanes into Lambourne. This is racing country. Stables, rides, thoroughbreds are all tucked away among the rolling acres of the Berkshire Downs. And chickens - chickens, cattle and sheep, to be exact, all as organic as can be, scratching, munching and meandering over Sheepdrove Organic Farm (01488 71659). Sheepdrove is the creation of erstwhile publishers Peter and Juliet Kindersley and their team, headed by Charles Maclean. Sheepdrove wasn't organic when they took it over; it has taken five years of hard work, setting about crop rotation to fix the nitrogen, dealing with blackweed and other botanical pests, and bringing the land into a natural state of health. </p> <p>And healthy it looks: rich, glossy, not manicured, but well cared for, well used. The secret, it seems, is to keep animals and crops on the move: monoculture doesn't suit the land in the long term. So here, for the time being, are the chickens, all 6,000 of them; 1,000 per state-of-the- free-range-poultry-art mobile barn, a crowd of white-feather-dusters fossicking around in the grass surrounding their homes. These are Rosscobs, says Maclean, who wears the kind of moustache you last saw in that Kevin Costner film about Wyatt Earp. Rosscobs, he says, are the racehorses of the poultry world, bred to put on weight rapidly and for flavour. </p> <p>The only trouble with them, however, is that they are nervy creatures, given to dying in numbers that can affect the farm's profitability. And, yes, Sheepdrove has to make money. There's no point in having a farm that is not run as a commercial enterprise; organic farming isn't just for posing. And he rattles off a battery of statistics, the general drift of which is to show that, while the yields and densities of crops and animals may be marginally lower and the pay-bill rather higher, the fact that he doesn't have to nuke the 1,850 acres, 130 suckler cows, 1,400 sheep and 6,000 chickens with a battery of chemicals means that he can achieve the same level of profitability as a conventional farm. </p> <p>But having chickens die on him doesn't help, so he's changing to Shavers. By the time they have been nurtured the organic way, he says, there won't be a discernible difference in quality, and he won't have so many unwanted carcasses on his hands. They don't deal in eggs at Sheepdrove, so they buy in day-old chicks, at which stage they are not organic - there isn't yet the supply of organic chicks available in this country - but, with the Soil Association's blessing, they will become organic by the time they leave the farm, plucked, trussed and packed. </p> <p>And here they are, 1,000 little fluffy balls hurtling around their nice warm, glassed-in room, just a few days old, just starting out on their 12 weeks of life - which, in case you're feeling sorry for them, is more than twice the life-expectancy of a broiler, whose span is a mere 35 days, and those spent in the most hideous of conditions. This lot are coddled. No debeaking here, or routine dosing with antibiotics. Organic feed, too. </p> <p>In a few days, these little chaps will be moved on to a less warm room, to make way, after the room has been cleaned and left for a week to reduce any risk of disease, for the next 1,000 lunches. Then, over 21 days or so, the warmth is reduced to acclimatise them to the temperatures outside. They're funny things, hens, you see - they like being outside. In fact, the colder it is, the better they like it. Give them a warm summer's day, and they lie around in the shade. Give them a good fall of snow, and they dash outside like small children. </p> <p>They are fairly carefully guarded against foxes by electric fences, but Maclean puts his faith more in what he calls the dominant-vixen system. Briefly, it goes like this. You let a vixen settle on your land. If she's happy, she'll keep her mate in order and scare off other foxes. All you have to do is bung her a few dead chickens every so often, so that she knows how well off she is. Not so long ago, Maclean was shooting half-a-dozen foxes a season - well, you would, if they kept going through your poultry shed like the plague. Now, he doesn't shoot any. That's called being in balance with nature. </p> <p>So, the chickens will enjoy these carefree conditions for around 81 days, until they weigh in at around 1.8-2.5kg, and then, at night, when they are all warm and sleepy, they are rounded up, popped into individual boxes to minimise stress and injury, kept in the dark for the same reason and, before they know what's happening to them, dispatched, bled, plucked and eviscerated in an ultra-modern unit and then hung up to get a bit of flavour into them. </p> <p>Actually, most of them aren't hung. Supermarkets aren't really in favour of too much flavour. More to the point, they think we aren't. But we should be. What is the point of a chicken, particularly an organic one, that doesn't taste of anything? </p> <p>So, here I have one in front of me, a fine fellow of 2kg or more. The breast is a bit longer than what you usually see in the chiller cabinet, and less, well, bust-like. The legs are longer, too, with the well-muscled look of the outdoor athlete.

      "bodyText": "There is a discreet reek of money and horse manure about the lanes into Lambourne. This is racing country. Stables, rides, thoroughbreds are all tucked away among the rolling acres of the Berkshire Downs. And chickens - chickens, cattle and sheep, to be exact, all as organic as can be, scratching, munching and meandering over Sheepdrove Organic Farm (01488 71659). Sheepdrove is the creation of erstwhile publishers Peter and Juliet Kindersley and their team, headed by Charles Maclean. Sheepdrove wasn't organic when they took it over; it has taken five years of hard work, setting about crop rotation to fix the nitrogen, dealing with blackweed and other botanical pests, and bringing the land into a natural state of health. And healthy it looks: rich, glossy, not manicured, but well cared for, well used. The secret, it seems, is to keep animals and crops on the move: monoculture doesn't suit the land in the long term. So here, for the time being, are the chickens, all 6,000 of them; 1,000 per state-of-the- free-range-poultry-art mobile barn, a crowd of white-feather-dusters fossicking around in the grass surrounding their homes. These are Rosscobs, says Maclean, who wears the kind of moustache you last saw in that Kevin Costner film about Wyatt Earp. Rosscobs, he says, are the racehorses of the poultry world, bred to put on weight rapidly and for flavour. The only trouble with them, however, is that they are nervy creatures, given to dying in numbers that can affect the farm's profitability. And, yes, Sheepdrove has to make money. There's no point in having a farm that is not run as a commercial enterprise; organic farming isn't just for posing. And he rattles off a battery of statistics, the general drift of which is to show that, while the yields and densities of crops and animals may be marginally lower and the pay-bill rather higher, the fact that he doesn't have to nuke the 1,850 acres, 130 suckler cows, 1,400 sheep and 6,000 chickens with a battery of chemicals means that he can achieve the same level of profitability as a conventional farm. But having chickens die on him doesn't help, so he's changing to Shavers. By the time they have been nurtured the organic way, he says, there won't be a discernible difference in quality, and he won't have so many unwanted carcasses on his hands. They don't deal in eggs at Sheepdrove, so they buy in day-old chicks, at which stage they are not organic - there isn't yet the supply of organic chicks available in this country - but, with the Soil Association's blessing, they will become organic by the time they leave the farm, plucked, trussed and packed. And here they are, 1,000 little fluffy balls hurtling around their nice warm, glassed-in room, just a few days old, just starting out on their 12 weeks of life - which, in case you're feeling sorry for them, is more than twice the life-expectancy of a broiler, whose span is a mere 35 days, and those spent in the most hideous of conditions.

This is one of the pleasures I get from visiting Scotland, quite apart from seeing old friends and making new ones. </p> <p>I have, in the past, stated that Iris reticulata is not a good species for growing to display in a pan because, even if the bulbs are fresh, a number are apt to come blind, which creates a spotty effect overall. A gardener near Edinburgh tells me that she succeeds by growing the bulbs in the same container (she uses big pans for impact) over a number of years. In this way, the bulbs increase and, if some are blind, which they will be, there'll be plenty of others to make up for them. </p> <p>\"Do you feed them?\" I asked, anticipating that the compost (I would recommend a soil-based compost) would become impoverished. She does, now and again, with Phostrogen, when the foliage is active after flowering. You can also do a bit of surreptitious soil replacement, when the bulbs become dormant, by teasing out some of it from the surface, without actually disturbing the bulbs; then top-dressing with fresh. </p> <p>I have often seen examples of a meadow area being broken up by dotting shrub rose bushes around it. More often than not, this is a failure, the bushes being starved by the turf and becoming unsightly scrags. However, I have recently seen examples where the roses throve, and in Scotland this was particularly the case with the so-called Scotch roses, varieties of Rosa pimpinellifolia, which do so well there. R. rugosa is another winner, being sometimes planted into broad roadside verges. These need to be on their own roots and will then sucker true to type. </p> <p>I have been seeing quite numerous beautiful examples of the Katsura tree, Cercidiphyllum japonicum. With its neat, rounded leaves arranged along an elegant branch system, it is most satisfying all summer, without depending on spring freshness or autumn glow. The latter, incidentally, varies a lot, being minimal in some, but with luck it is warm apricot - wonderful when you are close to a tree with sunshine setting it alight. </p> <p>This tree has quite a reputation for smelling deliciously of caramel, when the leaves are falling. A friend tells me that he catches the same aroma after young foliage has been clobbered by a spring frost. I got a good whiff of it from a friend's unprovoked tree in June, when it was in full leaf. </p> <p>Katsuras naturally make upwards of a dozen trunks, flaring outwards from the base. This suits them, and they should not be forcibly limited to a single stem. Buy yours young, and let it grow naturally. An exposed position will make it sulk. The shelter of other trees, fairly but not too close at hand, will be a great help. </p> <p>One of the hostas that I normally dislike most is 'Frances Williams', which has large, corrugated leaves of rounded outline. It commands our attention with a broad, marginal yellow rim, framing a glaucous centre. Unfortunately, the rim makes quite a practice of scorching to brown, even early in the season - look at yours now and see if I'm not right. In Scotland, this defect is less marked and it was less marked still in one example, where the hosta was quite closely set around with other perennials, notably cranesbeills (Geranium sylvaticum was one of them), sometimes even poking through its leaves. This effectively diluted their knock-me-down impact. </p> <p>It amazed me that in the walled garden at Inverewe, in north-west Scotland, I saw a very wide range of vegetables being grown to greater perfection than I have ever seen them in my life. And they were well on their way to maturity, despite the cool climate and high latitude. </p> <p>Will Soos, the young man growing them, practises the device of raising a great many kinds in modules under glass, so as to promote good growth early on. They are, of course, hardened off before planting out. This treatment gets them off to a flying start. </p> <p>There was, on June 22, Florence fennel, almost ready to cut from a March sowing. Then, mouth-wateringly tender-looking kohl-rabi, just right for eating. Will says that, besides steaming them in the usual way, they are also excellent thinly sliced into salads. I can imagine it. </p> <p>He also grows many flowers in this way, including hardy annuals. Direct sowing could never produce as good results. If each plant is given individual treatment from the moment it can be handled, it will be a primadonna. Large plants have far more staying power than small, and only one tenth the number will be needed. </p> <p>\"What a lot of trouble!\" will be the natural reaction, but what a lot of satisfaction, too. This is not a question of producing prize blooms or vegetables for the showbench, but for your own personal enjoyment in garden and kitchen. Neither is there the slightest need or desirability to use artificial fertilisers. I should add that an asset at Inverewe, unavailable to most of us, is fresh seaweed, washed up on the beach at certain times of the year. Without any weathering or other treatment, it can be used immediately, either dug in or as a surface mulch. I have met the same ancient practice in Cornwall.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood so routinely butchers everyone's favourite books that when it manages to get things even half right, it should be cause for universal celebration, perhaps even wild rejoicing in the streets. This thought is occasioned by the release of High Fidelity, a movie that isn't quite as good as the book, but is still very, very entertaining. Get out the noisemakers now.</p> <p>Unlike last year's The End Of The Affair, which inexplicably sabotaged the Catholic under-pinnings of Graham Greene's great novel, or The Talented Mr Ripley, which foolishly jettisoned Patricia Highsmith's calculating psychopath in favour of Matt Damon's petulant nerd, High Fidelity is religiously faithful to the spirit of Nick Hornby's wonderful novel, even though the setting has shifted from London to Chicago. It falls very much into the same class as The English Patient, Housekeeping and The Remains Of The Day: well-made, thoroughly appealing movies that show it is possible to take one beautiful thing and make another beautiful thing out of it. Nothing in the entertainment industry is more miraculous than a great book that does not get turned into an unwatchable movie. It is almost enough to restore one's faith in a caring, loving God. Almost.</p> <p>For people who are not familiar with Hornby's novel - and you should all be ashamed of yourselves - High Fidelity tells the story of a loveable London loser who is having trouble letting go of his fading youth. The owner of an unprofitable record shop that specialises in rarities, bootlegs and the types of little-known recordings whose ownership identifies one as a high priest of the counter-cultural elect, Rob is the sort of ageing adolescent who can never forgive his girlfriend for deliberately, pre-meditatedly listening to Art Garfunkel records, and worse, actually professing to like them. </p> <p>While it is true that listening to Art Garfunkel records is one of the worst cultural transgressions for which a human being can be held accountable, it's not on a par with murdering innocent women or children or putting cats in the microwave or even listening to Billy Joel records, so gradually Rob has to face up to the fact that his endless list-making and star-ranking and trotting out of rock arcana is a tad juvenile. Moreover, he has to realise that his determination to remain a ranking member of a microscopic cabal of male rock cognoscenti (his employees, a few pathetic customers) is severely hampering his social life.</p> <p>Seeking to come to terms with his myriad personality disorders, Rob sets out to reconstruct all of the relationships he has had in his adult life, hoping to pinpoint why each of them went wrong. Ultimately he must come to accept that it is possible to fall in love with a woman who cannot tell Neil Young from Neil Sedaka, and to recognise that endlessly dreaming up new ways to organise his record collection is not the most direct route to developing human potential. In short, while it's nice to know when Nick Drake died, and even who Nick Drake was, it's better to have a girlfriend. </p> <p>High Fidelity is faithful to the twin strands that run through Hornby's novel. As in the book, the funniest parts of the movie deal with music, the least funny parts with women. This could be because rock'n'roll is inherently easier to laugh at than women, though here I am only guessing. John Cusack, as Rob, spends a good portion of the movie talking to the camera, laboriously explaining his obsessions, his fixations, his failures as a lover. One of the film industry's most persistently entertaining performers, Cusack perfectly captures the plight of the thirtysomething hipster who belatedly realises that collecting obscure Solomon Burke records and limited-edition Dutch EPs by The Cure makes a good hobby but a bad lifestyle.</p> <p>When he is in the shop, trading rock trivia with his two employees, the results are very comic indeed. Todd Louiso plays a timid, mega-geeky music aficionado with an almost monastic devotion to obscure rock bands, while Jack Black plays a pudgy, acid-tongued social misfit with an encyclopedic knowledge of rock's dimly lit undergrowth. Unlike Cusack, who has trouble hanging onto his dates, these two have trouble getting dates. None the less, they do have an oddly pathetic charm. Or perhaps they are simply charmingly pathetic.</p> <p>Not all of the casting is equally successful. Catherine Zeta Jones is out of her element as a funky predatoress Rob met in college; though the movie transpires in Chicago's bohemian district of Wicker Park, Zeta Jones seems too bellicosely glamorous to have ever insinuated herself into Cusack's life, much less Wicker Park. Iben Hjejle, who plays Laura, the love of his life, is adequate in the role of the long-suffering wife-to-be, but no more. The ubiquitous indie stalwart Lili Taylor is seaworthy as a ship Cusack passes in the night, Tim Robbins, as a pony-tailed rival for Laura's affections, is, as always, superb. </p> <p>If High Fidelity has any failing, it is a sense that the subculture Cusack inhabits is more a British one than an American one, that people are much more likely to encounter arrested-development vinyl-philes like Rob in London than America's great midwest. The same can be said of La Cage Aux Folles, whose transplantation from France to Miami in The Bird Cage was not 100% successful. But, like The Bird Cage, the transplant works well enough. High Fidelity is not the funniest American movie of the past year - Being John Malkovich is. But it is the second funniest film and, like Being John Malkovich, it stars John Cusack. John Cusack must be doing something right. Everything, in fact.</p>",

The owner of an unprofitable record shop that specialises in rarities, bootlegs and the types of little-known recordings whose ownership identifies one as a high priest of the counter-cultural elect, Rob is the sort of ageing adolescent who can never forgive his girlfriend for deliberately, pre-meditatedly listening to Art Garfunkel records, and worse, actually professing to like them. While it is true that listening to Art Garfunkel records is one of the worst cultural transgressions for which a human being can be held accountable, it's not on a par with murdering innocent women or children or putting cats in the microwave or even listening to Billy Joel records, so gradually Rob has to face up to the fact that his endless list-making and star-ranking and trotting out of rock arcana is a tad juvenile. Moreover, he has to realise that his determination to remain a ranking member of a microscopic cabal of male rock cognoscenti (his employees, a few pathetic customers) is severely hampering his social life. Seeking to come to terms with his myriad personality disorders, Rob sets out to reconstruct all of the relationships he has had in his adult life, hoping to pinpoint why each of them went wrong. Ultimately he must come to accept that it is possible to fall in love with a woman who cannot tell Neil Young from Neil Sedaka, and to recognise that endlessly dreaming up new ways to organise his record collection is not the most direct route to developing human potential. In short, while it's nice to know when Nick Drake died, and even who Nick Drake was, it's better to have a girlfriend. High Fidelity is faithful to the twin strands that run through Hornby's novel. As in the book, the funniest parts of the movie deal with music, the least funny parts with women. This could be because rock'n'roll is inherently easier to laugh at than women, though here I am only guessing. John Cusack, as Rob, spends a good portion of the movie talking to the camera, laboriously explaining his obsessions, his fixations, his failures as a lover. One of the film industry's most persistently entertaining performers, Cusack perfectly captures the plight of the thirtysomething hipster who belatedly realises that collecting obscure Solomon Burke records and limited-edition Dutch EPs by The Cure makes a good hobby but a bad lifestyle. When he is in the shop, trading rock trivia with his two employees, the results are very comic indeed. Todd Louiso plays a timid, mega-geeky music aficionado with an almost monastic devotion to obscure rock bands, while Jack Black plays a pudgy, acid-tongued social misfit with an encyclopedic knowledge of rock's dimly lit undergrowth. Unlike Cusack, who has trouble hanging onto his dates, these two have trouble getting dates. None the less, they do have an oddly pathetic charm. Or perhaps they are simply charmingly pathetic. Not all of the casting is equally successful. Catherine Zeta Jones is out of her element as a funky predatoress Rob met in college; though the movie transpires in Chicago's bohemian district of Wicker Park, Zeta Jones seems too bellicosely glamorous to have ever insinuated herself into Cusack's life, much less Wicker Park. Iben Hjejle, who plays Laura, the love of his life, is adequate in the role of the long-suffering wife-to-be, but no more. The ubiquitous indie stalwart Lili Taylor is seaworthy as a ship Cusack passes in the night, Tim Robbins, as a pony-tailed rival for Laura's affections, is, as always, superb. If High Fidelity has any failing, it is a sense that the subculture Cusack inhabits is more a British one than an American one, that people are much more likely to encounter arrested-development vinyl-philes like Rob in London than America's great midwest. The same can be said of La Cage Aux Folles, whose transplantation from France to Miami in The Bird Cage was not 100% successful. But, like The Bird Cage, the transplant works well enough. High Fidelity is not the funniest American movie of the past year - Being John Malkovich is. But it is the second funniest film and, like Being John Malkovich, it stars John Cusack. John Cusack must be doing something right. Everything, in fact.",

That bad perm, for example, will eventually grow out, while your rash purchase of Celine Dion's greatest hits can always be given to a charity shop or jumble sale. But, \"Oops, I've done the wrong degree\"? What happens if you've spent three years at university studying something you weren't remotely interested in? </p> <p>It's more common than you might think. David Gilmour went to Portsmouth Polytechnic (now Portsmouth University) in the 80s to study quantity surveying. Within a few weeks, he wished he'd never applied in the first place. \"I hated Portsmouth, I hated university and I hated the course,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I never knew what I wanted to do when I left school but I was good at DIY so someone suggested surveying. I got the idea it would get me out of the office and that I'd spend my time going round building sites doing practical things.

I'd known right from the start that I had no intention of working as a surveyor.\" </p> <p>There are several reasons why people do the 'wrong' degree, says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. Some, like Gilmour, find the subject doesn't live up to their expectations. Others, he says, are restricted by their choice of A-levels or didn't know enough about all the other options open to them before they decided which course to study. </p> <p>\"You also change as a person when you go to university,\" Mr Cooper continues. \"Often, as a young person, you're influenced by your parents. You want to please them and 'buy' their dream for you, so you go to college to study law or medicine or whatever. </p> <p>\"But when you start the course, you develop interests in lots of things and you meet new people. You may start to realise that you don't want to be a doctor or a lawyer after all.\" </p> <p>The good news, says Cooper, is that it often doesn't matter what subjects you studied when it comes to finding a job, so your wrong degree may be alright after all. \"People shouldn't think of a degree as vocational training,\" he asserts. \"What it teaches you is how to learn and gives you a framework to do that. You learn that there is more than one answer and more than one textbook. You learn to use your own resources. </p> <p>\"What employers are trying to recruit is talent, analytical ability and self-confidence,\" he points out. </p> <p>\"The top five accountancy firms, for example, recruit graduates from any discipline. In fact, I would estimate that about 50% of graduates end up doing something totally different to what they studied at university.\" </p> <p>David Gilmour agrees. After Eastbourne, he spent two years in Spain teaching English where he learned to speak Spanish fluently. Back in the UK, his language skills, coupled with the fact that he had a degree, secured him a job with a travel agent. From there, he and a colleague set up their own specialist travel company, South American Experience which, 13 years later, has a healthy turnover and employs eight staff. </p> <p>\"I felt for a long time that I'd wasted three years at university,\" he admits, \"but in retrospect I think that getting a degree was important, no matter what it was in.

The first thing, says Mr Connolly, is to recognise the triggers of your anger and anxiety. He describes five: Thinking 'Shoulds': Where what you think should happen and what does happen is diametrically opposed. Reading Minds: Where you not only get annoyed about someone's behaviour but also what you perceive to be its intention. Collecting Straws: Where you collect the little incidents that ultimately break the camel's back. Suppressing Feelings: Where you deny anything negative only to have it implode later on. Criticising Yourself: Where you push yourself to meet unreasonable goals. </p> <p>Once you've identified your stress buttons, the next thing to do is realise that you have a choice about whether or not you allow them to get pushed. So, as things build up, and build up, and build up until you can't take any more, try, Mr Connolly says, to remember that you can choose how to react. The secret to keeping calm lies in \"accepting you won't always win everything\". </p> <p>There will \"always be people, things and circumstances that just won't go your way and you need to accept they never will go your way.

      "body": "<p>Twenty-two-year old Lynne Miles is one of the feted top 10% that all the big cheeses in graduate recruitment want to woo. On track for a 2:1 and with an impressive 40 A-level points, this Warwick finalist is a great communicator with a good range of work experience and the kind of track record in student societies that gives good CV. </p> <p>And while her career aspirations have yet to be formulated further than a vague interest in merchant banking, Lynne knows exactly what she wants from her future employer. </p> <p>\"Money,\" she says flatly. \"We students are poor - and mine is the first year who'll graduate with debts from paying tuition fees as well. My friends and I are looking for a salary between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000. At \u00a330,000, the wow factor sets in.\" </p> <p>According to 'human asset measurement organisation' Saratoga Europe, companies spend on average \u00a37,179 recruiting each of their graduate intake. So it must be disheartening to hear that at least one of their target students can be swayed by something as simple as a pay cheque. </p> <p>Human resources departments have long been keen to highlight their \"competitive\" salaries, yet for them this is a single shot in the propaganda war. From a juggernaut visiting your campus to bananas in your pigeonhole, recruiters have ways of making you join. </p> <p>Today's students are bombarded with corporate information from the moment they matriculate. Faced with university careers services overflowing with glossy company brochures, it is unsurprising that this sophisticated audience treats many of them with cynicism. </p> <p>\"The message we get from students is tell it how it is,\" says Davina Clapham, who works in graduate communications at consultancy Park Human Resources. </p> <p>\"They switch off when a firm uses corporate speak, talks about its chairman and how long it's been around. They want honesty - and someone who's done it.\" </p> <p>Case studies in brochures are popular - although she acknowledges that students are unlikely to warm to a \"starry-eyed recruit talking about how her time in Chicago has enriched her life\". </p> <p>\"If those brochures are too slick they become unrealistic,\" she adds. \"I remember a brochure for Boots in which one of the case studies admitted that Boots wasn't her first choice employer - but that the job has worked out well and she enjoyed what she did.

      "bodyText": "Twenty-two-year old Lynne Miles is one of the feted top 10% that all the big cheeses in graduate recruitment want to woo. On track for a 2:1 and with an impressive 40 A-level points, this Warwick finalist is a great communicator with a good range of work experience and the kind of track record in student societies that gives good CV. And while her career aspirations have yet to be formulated further than a vague interest in merchant banking, Lynne knows exactly what she wants from her future employer. \"Money,\" she says flatly. \"We students are poor - and mine is the first year who'll graduate with debts from paying tuition fees as well. My friends and I are looking for a salary between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000. At \u00a330,000, the wow factor sets in.\" According to 'human asset measurement organisation' Saratoga Europe, companies spend on average \u00a37,179 recruiting each of their graduate intake. So it must be disheartening to hear that at least one of their target students can be swayed by something as simple as a pay cheque. Human resources departments have long been keen to highlight their \"competitive\" salaries, yet for them this is a single shot in the propaganda war. From a juggernaut visiting your campus to bananas in your pigeonhole, recruiters have ways of making you join. Today's students are bombarded with corporate information from the moment they matriculate. Faced with university careers services overflowing with glossy company brochures, it is unsurprising that this sophisticated audience treats many of them with cynicism. \"The message we get from students is tell it how it is,\" says Davina Clapham, who works in graduate communications at consultancy Park Human Resources. \"They switch off when a firm uses corporate speak, talks about its chairman and how long it's been around. They want honesty - and someone who's done it.\" Case studies in brochures are popular - although she acknowledges that students are unlikely to warm to a \"starry-eyed recruit talking about how her time in Chicago has enriched her life\". \"If those brochures are too slick they become unrealistic,\" she adds. \"I remember a brochure for Boots in which one of the case studies admitted that Boots wasn't her first choice employer - but that the job has worked out well and she enjoyed what she did. It was a refreshing and honest approach.\" The Naked Truth, the highly praised Asda recruitment video that takes a documentary-style approach to a graduate's lot, is in a similar vein. Shot by their graduate intake for the next generation of potential recruits, it communicates the upsides, downsides and fast pace of the Asda work environment. \"We've actually had a downturn in applications from 8,000 to 2,000 since we started producing a video,\" says Asda's Andrea Vowles. \"It's great for us, because it acts as a natural filter and ensures that the people who do apply have an understanding of our working culture and know what they're letting themselves in for.

      "body": "<p>If you happened to find yourself two Saturdays ago in the village of Badia Agnano near Arezzo in southern Tuscany, you would have witnessed an improbable scene of young men of the village parading in all the uniforms of the second world war. They were dressed as Italian Fascists and German Nazis, as American GIs and British Tommies, all marching along together in cheerful comradeship. Onlookers cheered them as they went by, but the warmest applause was reserved for a marcher who wasn't in uniform at all, but was casually dressed in cotton trousers and an open-neck shirt. Women ran from the side of the street to embrace him; children waved little flags at him. And the flags they were waving were Union Jacks, for this tall and unassuming man was the only genuine war veteran in the parade. He was 78-year-old former British Army private Ted Doyle, from Ellesmere Port on the Mersey, who in July 1944 entered Badia Agnano in the wake of the retreating Germans. </p> <p>Badia Agnano is a small place with a population of maybe 1,000. It is neither architecturally nor historically distinguished. Most of its buildings are of post-war construction. Nevertheless, a few years ago, a group of its citizens started a society called \"Come eravamo una volta\" - \"How we once were\" - to cultivate an interest in its past. They have since been organising exhibitions of old photographs and forgotten agricultural implements to evoke the village of yesteryear. They have even organised historical lectures and debates. But this year they put on their most ambitious festival yet. They staged a weekend of exhibitions and parades, focusing for the first time on the second world war. </p> <p>As everyone knows, the Italians had an immensely complicated war, from which they failed to emerge with much glory. Allied first of all with the Germans, they were subsequently occupied and brutally treated by them. Three villages close to Badia Agnano were the scenes of massacres on June 29, 1944, in which well over 200 people were shot dead in Nazi reprisals for the killing of two German soldiers by partisans. The British arrived in the area two weeks later, as part of the conquering allied advance, and discovered and investigated the massacres. Rumours still persist that the Germans were aided and abetted in these atrocities by Italians still loyal to the Nazi cause, though there is no conclusive evidence to prove it. Despite all these complications and sensitivities, exacerbated by the fact that there are now far more Germans than British with holiday homes in the area, Badia Agnano decided to celebrate its liberation by the British in 1944 by inviting one of its liberators to attend this month's festivities. </p> <p>It approached the British ambassador to Rome, Sir Tom Richardson, who happens to have a holiday cottage only a mile or two away, and the research he set in train produced Ted Doyle, who is one of the very few surviving British war-time visitors to Badia Agnano, and practically the only one who met the villagers' condition of actually remembering something about it. </p> <p>They struck gold in Ted. Although he couldn't remember a great deal about the village - he was there for only a few days, the Germans having abandoned the place before the British arrived - he could at least remember the desperation of its inhabitants at the time, with their lack of food and their ruined homes. He was moving in recalling these things, and they were moving in return. They not only paid the air fares of Ted and his son, Michael, and put them up for several days in a hotel; they wined them and dined them without a break while they were there, and they never stopped thanking Ted for his part in expelling the Germans from Italy. Ted played a big part in this. Although he was involved in no fighting at Badia Agnano itself, he subsequently lost a lung and several fingers in a battle on the Adriatic coast and was invalided back to Britain with the Military Medal. </p> <p>Now he is a remarkably fit and sprightly man, whom one would hesitate to describe as old. The \"Meeting with Ted\", as one of the events in the village was billed in ubiquitous posters, was a truly touching occasion, full of genuine emotion. Ted's affection for the people of Badia Agnano was matched by their affection for him. </p> <p>One of the depressing consequences of British debate about the European Union, about whether or not we should join the euro, is the way it embitters our attitude to other European countries and makes us forget how much we share. We do not even believe that there are people on the continent who are grateful to us for what we did for them in the war. But, as Ted proved, there definitely still are.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Burnt out by the dot.com shake-out? If the chatrooms are any guide, the new breed of internet-based share traders are now plunging down often murky mineshafts or punting on dubious derricks in far distant oil fields. </p> <p>Natural resources - gold, diamonds, oil and gas - are the new dot.coms as the punters look for the next \"tenbacker\", a share that multiplies 10 times in double quick time. But investors lured in by potential huge gains could be literally pouring their cash into a bottomless hole in the ground. </p> <p>Only a minority of \"junior\" mining and oil exploration companies - the small fry quoted on the alternative investment market, or in overseas markets such as Ireland or Australia - ever find what they are looking for. And even fewer make economically viable discoveries. Many just keep raising money from hapless investors to finance yet more exploration. </p> <p>But that doesn't stop chat room devotees in their search for a quick route to riches - or for an escape route from a poor performer - by convincing others to buy. </p> <p>Take Bula Resources, a Dublin based \"black gold\" play. It has been around for years, looking for oil in both Siberia and Libya. Earlier this week one investor, 'Jupiter's Lover' posted on iii: \"I bought more today as I'm hearing that the announcement is now about to come - the offices in Libya have been moved into and the ceremony is either this week or next. Get into these as there is a lot of interest brewing.\" </p> <p>But 'Sospanfawr' is a bit more down to earth. \"Do you have any ideas what they are likely to go up to? I've been holding them for seven years (after a hot tip!!!).\" </p> <p>Bula predates the internet. Back in 1994, an anonymous Bula investor (who came from Guildford) faxed newspapers with fanciful stories about directors pretending to fly to see interests in Siberia while changing planes in Frankfurt and heading to secret deals in Libya. </p> <p>The shares have been as high as 7p and as low as 0.75p - the latter following Irish fraud squad action and a disappearing director in 1998. And while Bula's latest statement (the company has gone through a complete change of management) is full of bull points such as higher oil prices, a better political situation in Libya and the \"enhancement of our asset acquisition strategy\", there are no words about earning any money from oil. </p> <p>Alternative investment market listed Pan Andean Resources is also a chat room favourite. The shares have multiplied five times to 50p so far this year. \"BUY, BUY, BUY!\" enthuses 'Tom Bear' on iii. \"I have done a lot of research, emailed the company etc. The risks aren't as big as some people reckon. The upside is massive and the price is cheap.\" </p> <p>The anonymous \"Citytipsters\" reckon it will go to 500p, based partly on enthusiastic quotes from a director who saw plenty of oil activity from a helicopter flight over the jungle. </p> <p>Some online punters are backing MinMet, in the hope that unsubstantiated rumours on the net that some unidentified person may have found a diamond as big as a cricket ball in a terrain not too far away from the company's own concession, turn out to be true. </p> <p>A year ago <a href=\"http://www.minesite.com\">www.minesite.com</a>, a free service paid for by exploration companies eager to post their latest statements, set up with only a few hits a day. Now it counts 5,000 . </p> <p>Its co-owner Robert Tyerman says \"interest is poised to be as big as dot.com mania. We could be at fever pitch by Christmas. There are literally hundreds of stocks for the punters but few are going to make it.\" But he warns against punters promising \"target\" share prices and advises finding out about promoters - some are serial fraudsters. </p> <p>Jeremy Batstone at NatWest Stockbrokers pours cold water over mines mania. \"The reality is that concern for interest rates and an economic slowdown is bad news for all natural resources shares. They are just geared plays on commodity prices and these could fall. Smaller companies will be hit hardest - they have nowhere to go.\" </p> <p>And for those still getting overexcited, there is always the example of Bre-X, the Indonesian gold mine which was quoted in Vancouver. It attracted huge investor interest. But after a director fell out of a helicopter, it was revealed that its claimed biggest precious metal find ever was just a massive hole in the ground.</p>",

Natural resources - gold, diamonds, oil and gas - are the new dot.coms as the punters look for the next \"tenbacker\", a share that multiplies 10 times in double quick time. But investors lured in by potential huge gains could be literally pouring their cash into a bottomless hole in the ground. Only a minority of \"junior\" mining and oil exploration companies - the small fry quoted on the alternative investment market, or in overseas markets such as Ireland or Australia - ever find what they are looking for. And even fewer make economically viable discoveries. Many just keep raising money from hapless investors to finance yet more exploration. But that doesn't stop chat room devotees in their search for a quick route to riches - or for an escape route from a poor performer - by convincing others to buy. Take Bula Resources, a Dublin based \"black gold\" play. It has been around for years, looking for oil in both Siberia and Libya. Earlier this week one investor, 'Jupiter's Lover' posted on iii: \"I bought more today as I'm hearing that the announcement is now about to come - the offices in Libya have been moved into and the ceremony is either this week or next. Get into these as there is a lot of interest brewing.\" But 'Sospanfawr' is a bit more down to earth. \"Do you have any ideas what they are likely to go up to? I've been holding them for seven years (after a hot tip!!!).\" Bula predates the internet. Back in 1994, an anonymous Bula investor (who came from Guildford) faxed newspapers with fanciful stories about directors pretending to fly to see interests in Siberia while changing planes in Frankfurt and heading to secret deals in Libya. The shares have been as high as 7p and as low as 0.75p - the latter following Irish fraud squad action and a disappearing director in 1998. And while Bula's latest statement (the company has gone through a complete change of management) is full of bull points such as higher oil prices, a better political situation in Libya and the \"enhancement of our asset acquisition strategy\", there are no words about earning any money from oil. Alternative investment market listed Pan Andean Resources is also a chat room favourite. The shares have multiplied five times to 50p so far this year. \"BUY, BUY, BUY!\" enthuses 'Tom Bear' on iii. \"I have done a lot of research, emailed the company etc. The risks aren't as big as some people reckon. The upside is massive and the price is cheap.\" The anonymous \"Citytipsters\" reckon it will go to 500p, based partly on enthusiastic quotes from a director who saw plenty of oil activity from a helicopter flight over the jungle. Some online punters are backing MinMet, in the hope that unsubstantiated rumours on the net that some unidentified person may have found a diamond as big as a cricket ball in a terrain not too far away from the company's own concession, turn out to be true. A year ago www.minesite.com, a free service paid for by exploration companies eager to post their latest statements, set up with only a few hits a day. Now it counts 5,000 . Its co-owner Robert Tyerman says \"interest is poised to be as big as dot.com mania. We could be at fever pitch by Christmas. There are literally hundreds of stocks for the punters but few are going to make it.\" But he warns against punters promising \"target\" share prices and advises finding out about promoters - some are serial fraudsters. Jeremy Batstone at NatWest Stockbrokers pours cold water over mines mania. \"The reality is that concern for interest rates and an economic slowdown is bad news for all natural resources shares. They are just geared plays on commodity prices and these could fall. Smaller companies will be hit hardest - they have nowhere to go.\" And for those still getting overexcited, there is always the example of Bre-X, the Indonesian gold mine which was quoted in Vancouver. It attracted huge investor interest. But after a director fell out of a helicopter, it was revealed that its claimed biggest precious metal find ever was just a massive hole in the ground.",

Yet Rice went on to do what the great Garfield could not, namely lead the club to a pot or two, and now that he, as manager, and Reiffel are in harness, a double promotion could be in the offing. </p> <p>With the Victorian's unbeaten 45 off 56 balls capitalising on the revival begun by Usman Afzaal, run out 14 shy of his third century of the summer, Notts, leaders of the National League Second Division, led <strong> Worcestershire</strong> by 74, then whipped out half the side and trail by just 79. </p> <p><strong> Sussex</strong> were buoyed by Michael Bevan, Reiffel's World Cup final colleague, whose unbeaten century earned a 231-run advantage over <strong> Essex</strong>. Depending on events at New Road, there might well be Martlets chirping at the top of the Second Division tonight. </p> <p>In the tussle for the wooden spoon, Jack Russell kept <strong> Gloucestershire</strong> afloat against <strong> Northamptonshire</strong> with a typically cussed 72 not out, a season's best. As it is, with 152 runs required to avoid an innings defeat and only two wickets standing, they are going down for the third time. </p> <p>Graeme Swann, an England off-spinner in the winter but paying 40 runs per victim prior to this game, claimed his first \"five-fer\" since September. </p> <p>Dropping Romesh Kaluwitharana, whose hell-for-leathering helped win the 1996 World Cup, has evidently done little to dim the spark at the top of the <strong> Sri Lanka</strong> order. In the Singer Cup final in Colombo, Sanath Jayasuriya and Avishka Gunawardene swatted 84 in 12 overs en route to setting <strong> South Africa</strong> 295. </p> <p>They fell 30 short after Muthiah Muralitharan (five for 44) had done unto them much as Alastair Campbell has been doing unto the British public, albeit rather more successfully.</p>",

Last month's hurried replacement of Shoaib Akhtar by Paul Reiffel - at 34 the new elder statesman of the overseas contingent, not to mention the 13th Australian - doubtless struck many Nottinghamshire followers as the most anti-climactic acquisition since Clive Rice succeeded Gary Sobers. Yet Rice went on to do what the great Garfield could not, namely lead the club to a pot or two, and now that he, as manager, and Reiffel are in harness, a double promotion could be in the offing. With the Victorian's unbeaten 45 off 56 balls capitalising on the revival begun by Usman Afzaal, run out 14 shy of his third century of the summer, Notts, leaders of the National League Second Division, led Worcestershire by 74, then whipped out half the side and trail by just 79. Sussex were buoyed by Michael Bevan, Reiffel's World Cup final colleague, whose unbeaten century earned a 231-run advantage over Essex. Depending on events at New Road, there might well be Martlets chirping at the top of the Second Division tonight. In the tussle for the wooden spoon, Jack Russell kept Gloucestershire afloat against Northamptonshire with a typically cussed 72 not out, a season's best. As it is, with 152 runs required to avoid an innings defeat and only two wickets standing, they are going down for the third time. Graeme Swann, an England off-spinner in the winter but paying 40 runs per victim prior to this game, claimed his first \"five-fer\" since September. Dropping Romesh Kaluwitharana, whose hell-for-leathering helped win the 1996 World Cup, has evidently done little to dim the spark at the top of the Sri Lanka order. In the Singer Cup final in Colombo, Sanath Jayasuriya and Avishka Gunawardene swatted 84 in 12 overs en route to setting South Africa 295. They fell 30 short after Muthiah Muralitharan (five for 44) had done unto them much as Alastair Campbell has been doing unto the British public, albeit rather more successfully.",

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3).

      "body": "<p>As Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff applied all 17st 12lb of heft to hoik the ball deep over long-on at Old Trafford on Thursday, there was one man watching events unfold with a keen personal interest. </p> <p>\"There's 10,000 people in the stadium, and 3,000 of them will be overweight,\" said Andrew Chandler, as the ball eventually returned from orbit and landed somewhere in the stand. \"Freddie's become a role model for them, proof of what you can do. They call me Chubby by the way. I'm 19 stone, so I should know what I'm talking about.\" </p> <p>Chubby is no ordinary fat fan of the outsized Flintoff. He is the player's agent and has been at the Lancashire lad's sizeable side throughout the most traumatic week of his career, a week in which he became embroiled in the first recorded instance of kiss-and-tell involving bathroom scales, with intimate details of his weight all over the back pages. </p> <p>\"By the way, it's not fair,\" said Chandler of his client's substantial reputation. \"He's not fat. He's heavy.\" Whatever the semantics, the implication of Flintoff's week has been the same: that his affection for fast food and ale are indicative of an ill-disciplined squandering of the enormous potential within him. It is a criticism that is stark, forthright and painful. </p> <p>\"Freddie's been embarrassed by it all to be honest, it's hurt,\" revealed Chandler. \"I can assure you it is not nice to be ridiculed in the press every day.\" </p> <p>But is the criticism not justified? After all, until Thursday, Flintoff had hardly put his sizeable shoulder to the England cause, failing frequently and succumbing to regular injury. </p> <p>\"I'd say the criticism was warranted, but not the way it was done,\" Chandler reckoned. \"A couple of weeks ago I was approached by the England management and warned about Freddie's weight, told that if action wasn't taken he'd be getting a letter. I agreed he was a stone too heavy and we'd do something. We put him on the Hay diet - not mixing protein and carbohydrate. </p> <p>\"But before it had any chance to work, the management leaked the story to the press. You have to wonder why.\" </p> <p>Well, why? </p> <p>\"It's always the way with England. When there's an inherent problem, find a scapegoat. It happened with Cork and Caddick, now it's Freddie. In Australia, they'd have taken a 22-year-old lad to one side, arm round the shoulder and sorted it out quietly. Here he's hung out to dry.\" </p> <p>For an agent, the scandal represented a challenge somewhat different from the one faced by the unhappy sportsman at the centre of it. </p> <p>\"He needed support, to be shown that somebody does care,\" Chandler said. \"But my heart didn't sink when I saw the story. Actually, now I come to think of it, it was the Guardian that started all this. But it wasn't 'Flintoff seen in brothel'. This was a human-interest story.\" </p> <p>And a human-interest story with which this agent was well equipped to cope. As well as Flintoff, the comfortably contoured Chandler also represents the golfers Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood. Chandler only needs to sign up Gazza and the Quinnell brothers to corner the market in luxuriantly waisted sportsmen. Experience suggests when it comes to applying positive spin on a \"too-tubby-to-play\" story, Chandler is in the Max Clifford class. </p> <p>\"We also represent Neil Fairbrother and Chris Schofield,\" he said in defence of his client list. \"And no one would describe them as overweight.\" Nevertheless, after Chandler had reassured Flintoff that he of all people could empathise with his predicament, the agent was quick to sense that the human-interest yarn might yield wider dividends. Within hours of the story breaking, his phone was ringing hot. </p> <p>\"We're in negotiations right now with three slimming companies looking to sponsor Freddie,\" he explained. \"You can't deny a week like this raises a player's profile. There's girls in my office with no interest in cricket who now know all about Fat Freddie. The other England lads have been asking him what deals [he'd] signed on the back of this. But profile is only any good if it comes with delivery on the pitch. There's no long-term commercial future in just having a profile. So if he's had a good knock on Thursday and the papers are full of how successful he is, then it's an absolutely fantastic week.\" </p> <p>And no doubt a copy of the back page of yesterday's Sun has already been sent to the framers ready to adorn Chandler's office wall, complete with the highly appropriate headline: Praise the lard.</p>",
