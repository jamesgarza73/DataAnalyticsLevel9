      "body": "<p>So, after weeks of preparation, I've finally experienced my first week as a traveller. I've only got one thing to say about it - it's fantastic. Whoever you are, whatever you're doing, I would so recommend you go and see a bit of the world. I promise you won't regret it.</p> <p>One of my biggest worries was that I'd be travelling on my own, and I'd be all alone in a strange country. This couldn't be further from the truth. I first met someone on the plane on the way over - a Scottish guy who'd decided to leave home only two days before. We got into conversation and ended up spending the next couple of days together while we both found our feet.</p> <p>My first couple of nights were booked at Global Village Backpackers, which is an absolutely central hostel. My first impression was that it was pretty basic, but as I got to know it, I discovered that it is the best hostel in the city. There is a great atmosphere, and you're guaranteed to meet a friendly face.</p> <p>I have to admit, the first two days I felt a bit homesick and overwhelmed by the city. Vancouver is an incredibly stunning city - just around the corner from the skyrise buildings, snow-topped mountains poke through.</p> <p>However, the size was a bit daunting at first. We went for a walk round the city, and down the incredibly trendy Robson Street, but after that I didn't really know what to do with myself. The best way to start seemed to be by going out drinking for the night. I just regret that my drinking partner was a Scot who believed I could keep up with him. One tip - all Vancouver's bars and restaurants are non-smoking. For me this was brilliant but smokers may find it frustrating.</p> <p>On Saturday, I had arranged to go out with Trish, one of the first people to send me advice. She and her boyfriend took me down to Stevenston, to the Fraser river south of Vancouver. It was a gorgeous day and seeing a couple of friendly faces and getting fish and chips really made me start to feel good about the whole trip. They were really hospitable and filled me in about the Vancouvan way of living. We passed loads of film crews - apparently loads of American films are set here because of the low taxes and the incredible similarity of Vancouver to some parts of suburban America.</p> <p>That night, I met a really nice group of people at the hostel and we arranged to hire a van and drive to Whistler the next day. That's the great thing about travelling - if you keep an open mind and don't have any fixed plans, so many opportunities are open to you.</p> <p>Hiring a van turned out to be an absolute bargain and meant we had freedom to stop at the gorgeous scenic spots en route. We had a mixed van of Aussies, Kiwis and pommies, and it turned out to be a brilliant day. The size of the lakes and mountains is incredible and it was nice to see some real snow. At a place called Squamish, we stopped to watch bald eagles soaring over huge, snowy mountains which, as one guy said, made you feel pretty insignificant.</p> <p>That evening we all headed to Malone's, where the beer is cheap. In general, beer in Vancouver is pricey so it made a nice change. We ended up having piggy-back races along the streets of Vancouver back to the hostel, which shows you the kind of high spirits present in nearly everyone you meet.</p> <p>Two days after that, after a day of thinking it over, I decided to head east with four others to try living in Banff for a bit. We hired a van for a week, again to give us freedom, and set off. As someone else in the hostel said, where else do people sit down, say \"Let's go to Banff,\" and the next day it's done? It's probably a little more expense than I thought I'd need for the Canada part of my trip, but then I thought what does it matter? My money's only there to be spent, and I really want to try some decent skiing.</p> <p>I hope to return to Vancouver in a week to finish (or start) exploring it. So far I have only really been to Stanley Park in the city itself. Stanley Park is beautiful - a wildlife haven smack in the middle of the city. After four hours of walking, I saw only a fraction of it.</p> <p>Last night I was contemplating staying in Canada for Christmas. I'm having such a good time I just don't want to leave. This diary barely scratches the surface of the fun and experiences I'm having and it's only been a week. Roll on the next eight months.</p>",

The best way to start seemed to be by going out drinking for the night. I just regret that my drinking partner was a Scot who believed I could keep up with him. One tip - all Vancouver's bars and restaurants are non-smoking. For me this was brilliant but smokers may find it frustrating. On Saturday, I had arranged to go out with Trish, one of the first people to send me advice. She and her boyfriend took me down to Stevenston, to the Fraser river south of Vancouver. It was a gorgeous day and seeing a couple of friendly faces and getting fish and chips really made me start to feel good about the whole trip. They were really hospitable and filled me in about the Vancouvan way of living. We passed loads of film crews - apparently loads of American films are set here because of the low taxes and the incredible similarity of Vancouver to some parts of suburban America. That night, I met a really nice group of people at the hostel and we arranged to hire a van and drive to Whistler the next day. That's the great thing about travelling - if you keep an open mind and don't have any fixed plans, so many opportunities are open to you. Hiring a van turned out to be an absolute bargain and meant we had freedom to stop at the gorgeous scenic spots en route. We had a mixed van of Aussies, Kiwis and pommies, and it turned out to be a brilliant day. The size of the lakes and mountains is incredible and it was nice to see some real snow. At a place called Squamish, we stopped to watch bald eagles soaring over huge, snowy mountains which, as one guy said, made you feel pretty insignificant. That evening we all headed to Malone's, where the beer is cheap. In general, beer in Vancouver is pricey so it made a nice change. We ended up having piggy-back races along the streets of Vancouver back to the hostel, which shows you the kind of high spirits present in nearly everyone you meet. Two days after that, after a day of thinking it over, I decided to head east with four others to try living in Banff for a bit. We hired a van for a week, again to give us freedom, and set off. As someone else in the hostel said, where else do people sit down, say \"Let's go to Banff,\" and the next day it's done? It's probably a little more expense than I thought I'd need for the Canada part of my trip, but then I thought what does it matter? My money's only there to be spent, and I really want to try some decent skiing. I hope to return to Vancouver in a week to finish (or start) exploring it. So far I have only really been to Stanley Park in the city itself. Stanley Park is beautiful - a wildlife haven smack in the middle of the city. After four hours of walking, I saw only a fraction of it. Last night I was contemplating staying in Canada for Christmas. I'm having such a good time I just don't want to leave. This diary barely scratches the surface of the fun and experiences I'm having and it's only been a week. Roll on the next eight months.",

But he revealed that auditors would had refused to give the service's annual accounts a clean bill of health this year because of \"minor\" discrepancies at a single health authority. \"I am confident that for the first time in many years, the NHS overall will achieve financial balance,\" said Mr Reeves. However, some health bodies will record overspends at the end of the financial year in April. In 1999-2000 the NHS reported a \u00a3220m overspend. But a \u00a3660m cash injection last spring has rejuvenated this year's health service finances, dampening earlier fears that the NHS could run up debts of about \u00a3500m. The NHS failed to extend its five-year record of \"unqualified\" accounts by the closest of margins because a health authority has received a qualified opinion from auditors on its accounts for 1999-2000. It ends a five-year run in which the accounts of all health authorities and trusts have remained unqualified, a feat seen as the direct result of the introduction of corporate governance arrangements to tighten financial controls. \"The accounts of one health authority received a minor qualification, which is a great shame. But let us keep it in perspective. Over the last six years, one set of accounts out of a total of 3,115 has been qualified - that is not a bad record,\" said Mr Reeves. Mr Reeves, who is stepping down as NHS finance director in February after nearly seven years in the job, also claimed that this year's major injection of cash into the health service was enough to start delivering the NHS plan. NHS funding is increasing by more than \u00a316bn in England over the four years from April 2000, a rise that is claimed to be the most substantial increase in the service's 50-year history. Even taking account of the rising costs of pay and prescribing, Mr Reeves said this still represented a \"massive injection of resources\". In November the NHS executive announced an 8.5% increase in allocations to health authorities for next year. \"We believe that if efficiency can increase by about 2%, then about 5% will be needed to respond to the various cost pressures such as activity, prescribing, pay, prices and pensions,\" he said. \"This leaves us with about 3%, or approximately \u00a31bn, for implementing the NHS plan in areas such as waiting, coronary heart disease and cancer.

Only the city of Nottingham has overall results below the average in 1997 and 1998 - fuel to the government's claim that the improvements in literacy and numeracy are percolating to all parts.</p> <p>The government looks on course to hit its target of 80% reaching level four in English and 75% in maths by 2002. This year 75% achieved the required level in English and 72% in maths. In science, 85% achieved level four.</p> <p>The National Association of Head Teachers said the performance tables should start including results for the higher level five, which about a quar ter of pupils achieve, and lower levels.</p> <p>David Blunkett, who threatened to resign if the level four targets were not met, said results in the 25 education action zones were improving by more than the national average.</p> <p>The education secretary said: \"These results are very good and show how well the government's literacy and numeracy strategies have been working.

      "bodyText": "Outstanding performances in surprising places illuminate the government's performance tables for primary schools in England, published in the Guardian today. The most dramatic year-on-year improvement in test scores was at Cleeve primary in the notorious Bransholme district of Hull, the biggest council estate in Europe. And the government's list of most improved schools, which measures increases in national test scores in English, maths and science from 1997-2000, is headed by two schools in deprived parts of Rotherham, Dalton Foljambe school and St Joseph's Catholic primary school. It is a measure of the improvements that all local education authorities have better results overall, by some distance, than the average in 1996. Only the city of Nottingham has overall results below the average in 1997 and 1998 - fuel to the government's claim that the improvements in literacy and numeracy are percolating to all parts. The government looks on course to hit its target of 80% reaching level four in English and 75% in maths by 2002. This year 75% achieved the required level in English and 72% in maths. In science, 85% achieved level four. The National Association of Head Teachers said the performance tables should start including results for the higher level five, which about a quar ter of pupils achieve, and lower levels. David Blunkett, who threatened to resign if the level four targets were not met, said results in the 25 education action zones were improving by more than the national average. The education secretary said: \"These results are very good and show how well the government's literacy and numeracy strategies have been working. The decision to introduce phonics, grammar and whole class maths teaching to all schools was not without opposition, but the challenge has been embraced by teachers and schools across the country.\" Based on primary school results, the best-performing local education authority is Richmond-upon-Thames in London, followed by Rutland, Wokingham, Surrey, and the Isles of Scilly. Nottingham has the worst overall results and the poorest results in English and science. The London borough of Hackney, and Bradford (which has the worst maths results), are respectively the second and third worst performing LEAs.

Shenington C of E primary in Banbury, Oxfordshire, maintained its record of achieving 100% in all subjects every year since the tests began.

Next year she expects to have only nine children taking the tests, which would mean she would not have to report her results. \"I'll be glad to take the opportunity to drop out of this silly contest,\" she said. Hutton Rudby school in North Yorkshire got 100% for the fourth year running. Of all schools to achieve 100%, Yeadon Westfield junior, on the edge of Leeds, achieved it with the greatest number of pupils taking the exam, 54 - making it arguably the top primary school in England. \"I don't feel the best,\" said headteacher Phil Metcalf. Mr Metcalf, who also marks science papers, said exams had become more predictable. \"There is a limited number of ways you can frame a question. You can tell - it's a very small curriculum in science.\" Wandle primary school in Earlsfield, south-west London, achieved the lowest overall score, with just six of its 29 pupils achieving level four in English and three in maths and science. Paul Larkey, the headteacher, said 38% of the pupils had joined part way through the year. The school is surrounded by prosperous homeowners but itself serves the difficult Henry Prince estate. More than half the children speak English as a second language and 60% are on free school meals.

Patients would own their record and be able to sell it to private companies \u0095 Much hospital based care will be carried out at home, using internet-based advice, with care and advice provided by community pharmacists, and lay health advocates But the report admits that NHS is not currently geared up to properly exploit the possibilities of technology. \"It is widely recognised that the organisation is at least a decade behind the commercial sector in information technology and its uses.\" The panel was chaired by Sir Michael Peckham, of University College London's school of public policy. Sir Michael is a former head of NHS research and development. The report says that within two decades, most NHS services and health service research and development, may be carried out by licensed non-public service providers. \"It is conceivable that the NHS in 20 years time will concentrate on the developmental aspects of health care and on the use of its brand name to permit a range of carefully chosen organisations to provide specific services to explicit quality standards,\" says the report. But the report, which builds up a picture of UK healthcare in 2020, also believes the essential principles of the NHS - of universal care free at the point of delivery - will survive, not least because of because its value to the UK economy. \"The opportunities for society in terms of physical, mental and economic health offered by comprehensive health care are clear,\" the report adds. \"A comprehensive national system with universal coverage and registration such as the NHS offers great potential advantages, particularly in terms of access to health care and equity of outcome. \"This will be increasingly important as new growth areas, such as genomics and informatics, risk exacerbating disparities between individuals and groups in society.\"",

But you know that it counts for nothing without love and respect. Love for one another whatever colour we are, whether we are African or Caribbean - yes, that too.\"</p> <p>Fighting back tears, he said that these were the values Mr Taylor and his family had taught Damilola. \"I hope and pray you can teach us too.\"</p> <p>He added: \"God bless Damilola, God keep his family and God help us find again those values of respect and love.\"</p> <p>The Rev Joel Edwards, general director of the million-strong Evangelical Alliance of which the church is a part, told the congregation that Damilola's death was an \"absolute catastrophe\".</p> <p>\"All of us must do all we can for the rhetoric and the publicity to ensure that we work together for a better community.\"</p> <p>He said the police, politicians and the churches could not solve the problems of crime and community alone. But he said the greatest \"desecration\" of Damilola's memory would be to let the publicity and political reaction obscure the pain of his death.</p> <p>Damilola's father Richard, 55, put his arm round the boy's mother, Gloria, 49, as they arrived with Tunde at the church in Old Kent Road.</p> <p>It is the church Damilola had attended three times a week with his family since they arrived in Britain from Nigeria four months ago.</p> <p>Today's service replaces what should have been a celebration of the boy's 11th birthday. His father said Damilola had planned to mark the day by taking treats to school and sharing them with his friends.</p> <p>The service was conducted by Pastor Olukayode Owolabi, who knew Damilola personally as the schoolboy used to attend Sunday school at the Pentecostal church.</p> <p>Two Bible readings were taken from the Old Testament Book of Genesis, recounting the story of Joseph, who was bullied, thrown down a pit by his brothers and cast out of society, but who later recovered and prospered.</p> <p>Hymns sung at the service were Rock of Ages, Abide with Me and Blessed Assurance, with three more special songs being sung by children of the church's choir.</p> <p>Earlier a small group of Damilola's Sunday school friends sang a moving tribute to him entitled Thank You Lord. One said it had been a \"privilege\" to know Damilola. Damilola's father wept as a short piece of saxophone music was played.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police were represented at the service at a very high level by Commander Joe Kay. The borough commander, Acting Chief Superintendent Rod Jarman, could not attend because he was deeply involved in the murder investigation.</p> <p>Organisers of the memorial service, which was put together in less than 48 hours, today received apologies for absence from the Prince of Wales, the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, and the home secretary, Jack Straw.</p> <p><b>Related story</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,406540,00.html\">Police in Damilola inquiry seek gang of youths</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/\">Policing crime</a></p> <p><b>In pictures</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery./0,8542,406632,00.html\">Damilola Taylor's last journey</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police</a><br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">London borough of Southwark</a><br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Local media: South London online</a></p>",

Mr Boateng paid tribute to Damilola as a \"bright rising star\". \"Respect and love were at the heart of Damilola's life,\" he said. \"Respect for his parents, respect for his big brother, respect for his teachers and respect for authority.\" He urged people with information about the killing to come forward. \"Speak, speak, tell the police what you saw.\" Mr Boateng also indicated that there should be more police officers, saying that we need \"new faces on the beat\". \"We know that, we respect that and we are determined that you will have that. But you know that it counts for nothing without love and respect. Love for one another whatever colour we are, whether we are African or Caribbean - yes, that too.\" Fighting back tears, he said that these were the values Mr Taylor and his family had taught Damilola. \"I hope and pray you can teach us too.\" He added: \"God bless Damilola, God keep his family and God help us find again those values of respect and love.\" The Rev Joel Edwards, general director of the million-strong Evangelical Alliance of which the church is a part, told the congregation that Damilola's death was an \"absolute catastrophe\". \"All of us must do all we can for the rhetoric and the publicity to ensure that we work together for a better community.\" He said the police, politicians and the churches could not solve the problems of crime and community alone. But he said the greatest \"desecration\" of Damilola's memory would be to let the publicity and political reaction obscure the pain of his death. Damilola's father Richard, 55, put his arm round the boy's mother, Gloria, 49, as they arrived with Tunde at the church in Old Kent Road. It is the church Damilola had attended three times a week with his family since they arrived in Britain from Nigeria four months ago. Today's service replaces what should have been a celebration of the boy's 11th birthday. His father said Damilola had planned to mark the day by taking treats to school and sharing them with his friends. The service was conducted by Pastor Olukayode Owolabi, who knew Damilola personally as the schoolboy used to attend Sunday school at the Pentecostal church. Two Bible readings were taken from the Old Testament Book of Genesis, recounting the story of Joseph, who was bullied, thrown down a pit by his brothers and cast out of society, but who later recovered and prospered. Hymns sung at the service were Rock of Ages, Abide with Me and Blessed Assurance, with three more special songs being sung by children of the church's choir. Earlier a small group of Damilola's Sunday school friends sang a moving tribute to him entitled Thank You Lord. One said it had been a \"privilege\" to know Damilola. Damilola's father wept as a short piece of saxophone music was played. The Metropolitan Police were represented at the service at a very high level by Commander Joe Kay. The borough commander, Acting Chief Superintendent Rod Jarman, could not attend because he was deeply involved in the murder investigation. Organisers of the memorial service, which was put together in less than 48 hours, today received apologies for absence from the Prince of Wales, the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, and the home secretary, Jack Straw.

      "bodyText": "Riot police fought pitched battles with anti-capitalism protesters today as the opening of the EU summit in Nice descended into mayhem. Teargas grenades were used on protesters and acrid clouds of the gas hung outside the conference centre in the south of France as the 15 heads of state and government prepared to meet leaders of applicant countries wanting full European Union status. And as the prime minister, Tony Blair, flew into the Mediterranean resort for what is likely to prove the most challenging EU summit of his premiership, his predecessor John Major urged the European commission to show it did not want to create a European superstate. Mr Blair is facing pressure to give up the British veto on taxation and border controls - something he has vowed to resist - as part of the drive to streamline the swollen EU procedures ahead of enlargement. Meanwhile Mr Major called on commissioners to end speculation about a federal Europe by publishing a clear draft statement setting out how far they wanted to see EU powers grow. The EU foreign affairs commissioner Chris Patten, a former Tory party chairman, insisted that the threat of a federal Europe was \"about as likely as the discovery that the moon is made of cheese\". But the Tory leader, William Hague, accused Mr Blair of losing control of the situation in Europe and warned that he would concede too much to Britain's EU partners. Over the three day summit, the EU is likely to give final approval for a strategy of intensified negotiations that could see the top candidates from the 13 applicant eastern European nations joining the EU by 2004. Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, Poland's minister for European affairs, said: \"The Europe of today has to take the opportunity offered by the courageous changes in Eastern Europe to unite the continent.\" Poland is among the leading group of candidates, along with Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus and the Czech Republic. In Nice, what the French had hoped would be a dignified summit ending with an historic treaty, began with running battles between hundreds of anti-globalisation demonstrators and police. Protesters hurled fireworks and furniture at the police, who responded with volleys of teargas grenades and what sounded at times like stun grenades. Up to 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets and there was alarm in diplomatic circles that they had come so close to the main conference venue. A pall of choking teargas greeted the dignitaries as they arrived at the Acropolis centre in the heart of this normally tranquil Riviera city, popular with French retirees and sun-seekers. The French president, Jacques Chirac, who is hosting the summit, sneezed as he entered the mammoth, concrete building. A fragmented group of several hundred Spanish anarchists, radical trade unionists, Basque and Corsican separatists fought pitched battles with the police as they sought to break through the ring of steel encircling the Acropolis. On one occasion, the demonstrators fought their way to within 100m of the centre's main entrance. A crowd attacked the car of a motorist who had collided with several protesters. Using sticks and pipes, they smashed the windows and forced the driver to flee in reverse. Undeterred, he again scattered demonstrators like dominoes. Two blocks from the Acropolis, a bank was set on fire, and protesters, some masked, attacked the fire engine that came to extinguish the flames. But the blaze was quickly put out. Protesters then turned on a real estate agency, smashing windows as terrified staff fled to an inner courtyard. Owner Luc Mercier said, \"I feel discouraged and disgusted.

The new web retailer, which has \u00a335m of funding from Waitrose, the John Lewis-owned supermarket, plans to launch next year. Ms Jobling, 40, took the helm at Liberty after the store in the wake of a boardroom bust-up. She was credited with restoring some of the lost cachet of the Liberty brand before the store was sold earlier this year. She previously worked at B&amp;Q, Sainsbury's and Tesco. Rob Anderson, previous head of the M&amp;S children's wear business, left in the summer. Mr King and Ms Jobling will both report to Roger Holmes, the former Kingfisher executive who is to join M&amp;S as managing director of UK retail in January. Mr Holmes' appointment has not been universally welcomed by City analysts, who claim that he lacks crucial experience in the food and fashion sectors. Chairman Luc Vandevelde said: \"Our aim has been to recruit the highest calibre candidates for these two key positions. We are delighted to increase the breadth of experience within the UK retail business.\" Before the arrival of Mr Vandevelde, M&amp;S rarely appointed from outside the organisation.",

But the traditional dot.com start-ups - a handful of nerds working in a trendy inner city loft - are likely to remain an uphill struggle for union organisers, who complain of an \"anti-union culture\". Richer pickings are to be had in the internet spinoffs and extensions of long-established businesses, in finance or the media, where unions are well-established and dot.com union agreements have already been signed. The other main areas targeted for unionisation are those where, as in the Amazon case, a traditional service is being delivered online, backed up by armies of staff in warehouses and call centres. \"We've got our hands full,\" one organiser remarks.",

Here are the four questions most often asked about handheld computers. </p> <p> <strong> 1. Do I need a desktop PC too?</strong> </p> <p> Yes, if you want your mobile to be more than a personal organiser. Link up with a PC and you can copy documents and work on them while you are out, then upload them when you return. The two devices \"talk\" to each other (\"synchronise\") when you connect them with a cable or via a docking cradle. Check before you buy that your PC has the right type of socket (USB or serial) to fit the mobile, and that the system requirements match your PC. A mobile computer with an infrared (IR) port can \"talk\" to any compatible device that also has an IR port. </p> <p> <strong> 2. How do you input information?</strong> </p> <p> With handhelds, you type in information via a small keyboard, and tap icons and menus on the screen with a stylus to select functions. This can be frustrating because the keyboards are so small. On palmtops, the screen is divided into a writing area and the display; you use the stylus to either tap the keys of an on-screen graphic keyboard or write on the touch-sensitive screen, which converts your handwriting into text. Both methods can be time-consuming and tricky if you have less than perfect vision. With some models, writing by hand involves following special rules, which takes a bit of getting used to. Palm and Handspring sell fold-up full-size keyboards that can be connected to their palmtops. </p> <p> <strong> 3. How much memory will I need?</strong> </p> <p> Go for as much as you can afford. Consider what you want to store - storing pictures and music from the net will use up a lot of memory. Most mobile PCs have optional extra memory cards. </p> <p> <strong> 4. Which operating system is best?</strong> </p> <p> There are four main systems - EPOC, Palm OS, Windows CE and Pocket PC. Palm OS is the simplest - adequate if you just want an organiser. The other three are useful if you want word processing and spreadsheet facilities. The OS determines what the screen looks like and which applications it offers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Just occasionally, we are challenged to rethink some of our basic premises about what we do and how we do it. The process is an uncomfortable one, but it can also be very rewarding. I have spent the last year as a member of an independent Commission on Poverty, Participation and Power, established by the UK Coalition on Poverty. Our remit was to identify the barriers faced by people experiencing poverty who want to participate in decision-making that affects their lives, and to propose ways forward. </p> <p>The commission emerged from a national \"grassroots\" consultation exercise, Voices for Change. What also made the commission different was that it was made up not just of the usual \"great and the good\", but also people with direct experience of poverty. It has convinced me of the value of the expertise borne of experience.</p> <p>The commission's report - published today - has important implications for welfare professionals as well as politicians (local and national). Participation and user-involvement increasingly are buzz words in government but the reality, as experienced by many people living in poverty, is rather different. The message that came across loud and clear from our consultations was that people in poverty are neither listened to nor respected. </p> <p>Voices for Change in south-west England told us of a meeting they'd organised: \"We invited so many councillors and council officials and they are not here. The leader of the council and the MP made their speeches and then scarpered. One councillor said he had to go to another meeting in the council house. They were discussing 'citizenship and democracy'! They should have been discussing it with us, here.\"</p> <p>Even where officials \"talk the participation talk\", all too often they fail to \"walk the walk\". Phoney participation, we were told, is experienced as the ultimate disrespect. If, for example, it involves incomprehensible forms, or the outcomes are not fed back, it can lead to cynicism and disillusionment. </p> <p>Professionals and officials act as important gatekeepers.

      "bodyText": "Just occasionally, we are challenged to rethink some of our basic premises about what we do and how we do it. The process is an uncomfortable one, but it can also be very rewarding. I have spent the last year as a member of an independent Commission on Poverty, Participation and Power, established by the UK Coalition on Poverty. Our remit was to identify the barriers faced by people experiencing poverty who want to participate in decision-making that affects their lives, and to propose ways forward. The commission emerged from a national \"grassroots\" consultation exercise, Voices for Change. What also made the commission different was that it was made up not just of the usual \"great and the good\", but also people with direct experience of poverty. It has convinced me of the value of the expertise borne of experience. The commission's report - published today - has important implications for welfare professionals as well as politicians (local and national). Participation and user-involvement increasingly are buzz words in government but the reality, as experienced by many people living in poverty, is rather different. The message that came across loud and clear from our consultations was that people in poverty are neither listened to nor respected. Voices for Change in south-west England told us of a meeting they'd organised: \"We invited so many councillors and council officials and they are not here. The leader of the council and the MP made their speeches and then scarpered. One councillor said he had to go to another meeting in the council house. They were discussing 'citizenship and democracy'! They should have been discussing it with us, here.\" Even where officials \"talk the participation talk\", all too often they fail to \"walk the walk\". Phoney participation, we were told, is experienced as the ultimate disrespect. If, for example, it involves incomprehensible forms, or the outcomes are not fed back, it can lead to cynicism and disillusionment. Professionals and officials act as important gatekeepers. They can use their position to keep people at arms length or they can facilitate their participation. Using plain English rather than jargon is critical. Yet few professionals are trained to work in a participatory way, nor do their organisations recognise and reward attempts to do so. Genuine participation also takes time. It also means addressing the kind of practical barriers that the Commission was told about, including: \u0095 lack of money; \u0095 fear that benefit will be withdrawn if participation is deemed as affecting availability for employment; \u0095 transport and childcare difficulties; \u0095 not having the right clothes. The report ends with a set of recommendations and principles for participation. They are premised on the central proposition that \"participation in the decision-making process of people with experience of living in poverty must be recognised as a basic human right\". Among the principles of particular relevance to welfare professionals are: \u0095 we must all be prepared to change how we think and act to make participation genuine and effective; \u0095 participation should be a strategy, not a device, and should take place throughout the process - from first steps to evaluation; \u0095 people who hold power must learn to listen properly to the voices of people living in poverty, to understand, to communicate in ways that everyone can understand, to respect people's contributions, and to act on their voices; \u0095 louder voices must not be allowed to drown out the weaker or more marginalised ones. No-one promised that participation would be easy, as we learned on the commission.

      "bodyText": "Radio Times editor Sue Robinson has quit after an incredible 20 years at the TV listings magazine. In a decision that has shocked the magazine's owners, she is quitting to take over at the helm of Sainsbury's magazine. Ms Robinson has been editor of the BBC-owned magazine for the past four years and is believed to have agonised over the decision to leave one of the biggest and most prestigious jobs in consumer magazines. Today BBC Worldwide was playing down her departure. A Radio Times spokesman said that BBC Worldwide doesn't want to rush the appointment of \"the biggest job in magazine publishing\". She will be replaced in the short-term by her predecessor, Nicholas Brett, head of the Radio Times arts and factuals group. Ms Robinson, who joined the Radio Times in 1980 as a subeditor, won the British Society of Magazine Editors' award for best magazine editor in 1999 and 2000. The award recognised that she has presided over stiff challenges to the 77-year-old magazine, with increased competition after the deregulation of the TV listings market. More recently, the Radio Times has come under pressure from multi-channel television and the growth of the electronic programme guide, and has recently signed deals with personal video recorder manufacturer Tivo and broadcaster ONdigital. Although Radio Times is now outsold by IPC Media's What's On TV?, which sells 1,707,815 copies, it comes a close second at 1,250,134. More importantly, according to BBC Worldwide, it is the most profitable magazine in the UK. In 1999, it generated \u00a332m in advertising revenue and \u00a356m in copy sales. A BBC spokesman said she went \"with the goodwill of all\" at Worldwide.",

It was officially launched in February 1998. The key organisation is the City Forum, which meets four times a year with a membership drawn from 25 strategic partner bodies.</p> <p>The forum agreed a set of general priorities - to create more jobs, to tackle crime, to combat poverty, to invest in young people, to create an exciting city centre and to meet the needs and aspirations of older people. It then set up six programme delivery groups charged with developing more detailed action programmes that would help deliver the objectives set out in the community plan.</p> <p>For policy and planning manager Peter Strachan, the plan plays a vital function in identifying community priorities. The latest newsletter will highlight a list of 32 targets set by the City Forum but he still believes there is room for greater public awareness of its role.</p> <p>\"We did succeed in getting a high level of involvement by working closely with our partner organisation when the scheme was first launched, but there is room for improvement so that people feel more involved and have greater ownership.

Councils do not yet know exactly how to use this landmark power to promote the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of their areas, since all they have to go on is draft guidance published in June. But in practice, many have been hard at work developing community plans for several years. The law currently requires councils to prepare community strategies that identify the needs of their areas. Though ministers have allowed considerable room for manoeuvre, authorities are obliged to work closely with other local organisations such as business, voluntary groups, residents, and other public agencies such as doctors or police to establish local priorities. This emphasis on public consultation and the involvement of partner organisations is a major step towards modernising local government. It gives councils a key leadership role because they are made up of elected community representatives. The objectives that emerge from the community planning process are also expected to inform the best value review process by encouraging councils to address \"cross-cutting issues\". These include community safety and sustainable development that are beyond the reach of conventional service delivery. It is easy to see how this approach can be extended to give councils a more prominent role, where they work with local health authorities to identify and develop policies to tackle health inequalities or forge strategic partnerships to promote neighbourhood renewal or economic development. Brian Pote-Hunt, strategic head of regeneration and partnership for Sutton council, says that its first attempt at a community plan provided the council with a list of priorities that ranged from reducing crime and creating a safer environment, to caring for the elderly and more vulnerable people. \"It was very much a list of general aspirations,\" explains Mr Pote-Hunt. \"Work has already started on a second plan. We learned a lot from the experience the first time around and expect to build on that by setting more specific targets and addressing some of the wider community issues.\" Sutton Borough Forum is the key agency for bringing together all the local organisations and Brian describes this as a \"partnership of partnerships\". The forum, rather than the council, has \"ownership\" of the community plan, according to Mr Pote-Hunt. In Coventry, the city council began work on its first community plan in 1997. It was officially launched in February 1998. The key organisation is the City Forum, which meets four times a year with a membership drawn from 25 strategic partner bodies. The forum agreed a set of general priorities - to create more jobs, to tackle crime, to combat poverty, to invest in young people, to create an exciting city centre and to meet the needs and aspirations of older people. It then set up six programme delivery groups charged with developing more detailed action programmes that would help deliver the objectives set out in the community plan. For policy and planning manager Peter Strachan, the plan plays a vital function in identifying community priorities. The latest newsletter will highlight a list of 32 targets set by the City Forum but he still believes there is room for greater public awareness of its role. \"We did succeed in getting a high level of involvement by working closely with our partner organisation when the scheme was first launched, but there is room for improvement so that people feel more involved and have greater ownership. In the end the plans to belong to their communities,\" he says.",

But even if the contest is finally resolved in the next few days, precious time and focus has been lost in managing the changeover.</p> <p>Although President Bill Clinton has promised to devote the remaining 50 days or so of his incumbency to foreign policy issues, particularly the Middle East, his influence is much diminished. In truth, his effectiveness has been circumscribed for months by the perception of him as a \"lame duck\" president. Any actions he may take between now and inauguration day on January 20, such as his visit to Ireland next week, will perforce be largely symbolic.</p> <p>The impact of the drift in Washington is far-reaching.

In Iraq, Saddam Hussein is deftly exploiting the hiatus to chip away at UN sanctions and unsettle international oil markets, with the active connivance of many Arab states. The US has been reduced to looking on helplessly.</p> <p>In Yugoslavia, the new government of Vojislav Kostunica is facing renewed, low-level conflict on Serbia's border with Kosovo and an attempted political comeback in next month's elections by the deposed Slobodan Milosevic. No progress has been made since the Belgrade revolution in delivering Mr Milosevic to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</p> <p>Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, has been busy exploiting the situation, too. To great American alarm, Russia has quietly resumed arms exports to Iran - a country that the US has attempted to isolate for the past eight years. Moscow has also increased its weapons dealing with China, identified as the biggest 21st-century security threat to the US, and stepped up its contacts with the \"rogue state\" North Korea. Mr Putin recently visited Pyongyang and - provocatively - will soon travel to another traditional US foe, Fidel Castro's Cuba.</p> <p>On the bigger question of international arms control agreements, the confusion is palpable. Mr Putin has offered deep cuts in Russia's nuclear weapons arsenal - but only if the US drops plans to deploy a new national missile defence (NMD) system known as \"son of Star Wars\".</p> <p>This proposal has merely added to American embarrassment. Nobody can say if and when NMD will go ahead. Mr Putin is left looking like a responsible and serious international leader while the US looks\u0085 well, embarrassed.</p> <p>Meanwhile a distracted Washington has fallen foul of the European Union on two fronts. Apparently uncertain of the future or limitations of its own policy, American negotiators clashed disastrously with EU countries at the recent climate change talks in the Hague. The result was the collapse of the delicate Kyoto process to combat global warming.</p> <p>And this week, the outgoing US defence secretary, William Cohen, threw an unexpected spanner in the works of the EU's nascent rapid reaction force, claiming that it could destroy the Nato alliance. Mr Cohen's statement was at odds with previous pronouncements by the state department and the White House - a sure sign that, increasingly, nobody is really in charge in Washington.</p> <p>Some of these logjams may ease if, say, George W Bush is confirmed as US president-elect. He is firmly committed, for example, to NMD and does not believe in global warming.

What does Mr Bush make of the possible collapse of democratic government in Indonesia? What might he do if faced by the failure of the UN peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone? What is his view on the still dangerous Indo-Pakistan confrontation over Kashmir? What will he do if terrorists again attack US targets in the Middle East?</p> <p>Despite his lame duck status, President Clinton may still have a few surprises up his sleeve. Once the presidential succession is settled, watch out for increased US diplomatic and military pressure on terrorists in Afghanistan whom the FBI has linked to the bomb attack in Aden on the USS Cole. This week the Washington Post, house journal of American government, called for a tough US riposte.</p> <p>In 1992, after losing the presidential election to Mr Clinton, former president George Bush Sr looked around for one last big gesture.

      "bodyText": "Mounting concerns over a global slump in advertising revenue have hit shares in Financial Times owner Pearson, after an American rival posted a profits warning. Pearson saw its stock fall 3%, or 50p, to 1595p in early trading after Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said fourth quarter earnings would fall below analysts' expectations. Dow Jones attributed the shortfall to a decline in financial advertising at its flagship publication, with November ad volumes down 12% compared with the previous year. A softening in the US economy has had a trickle-down effect, with fewer flotations leading to fewer advertisements from banks announcing their participation in initial public offerings. Analysts said Dow's figures were no surprise, given the high advertising revenue the same time last year. But they said the signs could be ominous for Pearson. Simon Baker, analyst at SG Securities, said: \"There is the possibility of a knock-on effect, in that other IPO markets could begin to weaken as well. \"Although Pearson's short-term figures might remain intact, perhaps next year there could be some weakening in figures and down-grading pressure.\" A Pearson spokesman said advertising revenue at the Financial Times for the first six months of the year was up 40% compared with the same period last year, and that circulation was also increasing. However, the media sector is currently experiencing an across-the-board slump in advertising revenue, with analysts predicting a decline in revenue growth to 2%. Big media stocks such as Walt Disney and News Corporation have been savaged on the back of concerns of a decline in advertising revenue, and UK companies Granada Media and Carlton have experienced similar problems. But shifts in the advertising scene are benefiting some companies. Analysts predict that roster consolidation will see a 12%-17% growth in advertising billings in 2001 for sector giants Aegis, Havas, Publicis and WPP.",

Her excoriating letter to Mr Desmond comes the day two more senior editorial staff quit the paper - award-winning home affairs editor David Taylor and veteran columnist Peter Hitchens. Ms Boycott registered her dismay at the way 60 staff, including a pregnant woman and a disabled man, learned they were made redundant yesterday. \"I understand that Sharon Harte, seven months' pregnant, was asked to distribute 'in' and 'out' letters round the floor,\" she said. \"She took the two bundles and then discovered that her name was on the list to go.\" Ms Boycott also complained about the way one of the paper's strategic researchers was cruelly dispensed, without any regard to the paper's commitment to him following a car crash. She says she fears contracts will not be honoured and many more editorial staff will walk in protest at the management team used by Mr Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell. \"There are human and inhuman ways of dealing with people whose services are no longer required,\" she writes. \"The journalists on the Express are - to a man and woman - good and honourable people, who will not stand easily by and watch colleagues lives being trashed by heavy handed management techniques.\" Mr Hitchens leaves the paper after 24 years, while Mr Taylor has been head-hunted by the Evening Standard where he was once a reporter. Editor Max Hastings has created a new post for Mr Taylor as home affairs editor. The letter underlines the increasingly bitter relations between Ms Boycott and Mr Desmond, who bought the Express titles two weeks ago as part of a \u00a3125m deal with United News &amp; Media boss Lord Hollick. She has already been forced to write to staff about \u00a340,000 bonuses that Lord Hollick sent to 25 apparently arbitrarily selected staff.

The latest in this line is Peter Hitchens,a formidable columnist who has been on the paper for 24 years. </p> <p>His weekly mail bag is the largest of any columnist on the Express.

She took the two bundles and then discovered that her name was on the list to go. Furthermore, two other pregnant women are on the 'out' list. Furthermore, I understand you are also considering dismissing Simon White, who has worked for the company for 21 years. Fourteen years ago, Simon was hit by a car and left with a speech impediment, a limp and a disabled arm. He is a strategic researcher in business development and, according to all his colleagues, \"excellent at his job\". But the real point is that following his accident, Simon was guaranteed a job for life with Express Newspapers as his disabilities mean it is virtually impossible for him to find other employment. Now he is in danger of being unemployed and faces never working again. I am concerned that the contracts of people leaving the company may not be fully honoured and would appreciate being told just how these people are being compensated for the loss of their jobs. If my information is incorrect, then please tell me. Everyone understands that any new management will want new teams. But there are human and inhuman ways of dealing with people whose services are no longer required. You might say: \"What has this got to do with editorial?\" The answer is a great deal. I have put enormous effort into building trust and relationships between departments: by treating people like this you just destroy all this work and good feeling. Furthermore, the journalists on the Express are - to a man and woman - good and honourable people, who will not stand easily by and watch colleagues lives being trashed by heavy-handed management techniques. As you are probably aware, many people are leaving the editorial floor because they are not happy to work for Northern and Shell. This type of behaviour will only hasten the exodus. The latest in this line is Peter Hitchens,a formidable columnist who has been on the paper for 24 years. His weekly mail bag is the largest of any columnist on the Express. He joins the Mail on Sunday early in 2001. David Taylor, our excellent Home Affairs Editor, has also resigned today. Rosie Boycott",

After 22 years, this salary goes up to a maximum of $70,000 (\u00a348,500) for a classroom teacher.</p> <p>Among other public servants, at least the police have the satisfaction of being dubbed The Finest in the popular newspapers. It's just as well that they receive this recogition in return for their no-win jobs, because their starting pay is $31,305 a year, again below that for those new to the uniform in some of the doziest nooks in nearby Long Island.</p> <p>Five years later, assuming they have managed to avoid shooting someone dead without good reason, they will be on $51,987. But unless they acquire a more elevated rank, they can go no higher than $54,978 after 20 years.</p> <p>The Bravest - that would be the firefighters - start on $32,724 and move up to $49,023 after six years. And garbage collectors - amazingly known as The Strongest - start on $27,842 and hit the heights with $44,441 after five years, about $4,000 less than a teacher or a policeman.</p> <p>Of the other caring professions, social workers start on up to $34,000 and can hope for about $55,000 by the time they are supervisors, about eight years later. Their employers say that, due to the rewarding, vocational nature of their work, it can be almost impossible to get social workers to go home at night; or maybe it's because they can't face the long journey now that the average two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan costs about $750,000.</p> <p>The designer Calvin Klein would probably concede that his, too, is a rewarding calling, irrespective of his consideration of $21.5m a year.

      "bodyText": "Some people will sidle up at a party and tell you about their liposuction before they ever let slip their name. Bob Dole, the defeated presidential candidate four years ago, is always on the television, telling you what Viagra has done for him (Al Gore should be keeping an eye on this one). And the daytime talk shows, it seems, will never exhaust the reservoir of otherwise bland individuals competing to outdo each other with the gaudiness of their confessions. But ask any of these exactly how much it is that they are paid for their trouble and they will look at you as though you have left the house with your dog, but without the means to cover the animal's tracks. New Yorkers might conform to many of the stereotypes attached to them and throw around tips so large as to suggest that money means nothing, but it does not follow that they will let you know what they have left in their back pockets as a result. The city's teachers are trying to get a decent settlement from the administration and have been offered a merit pay system, three weeks without wages and more time in the classroom. These suggestions have been embraced with all the variety of outrage that might be expected, but that does not mean that anyone would do anything so gauche as to disclose what they are paid or what they want. In fact, a teacher with a BA starting out in the city makes $31,910 (about \u00a322,000) a year, or nearly $8,000 less than many in the same position in the suburbs where, it is fair to surmise, many of the inquiring young minds in the beginner's charge will not be quite so challenging. After 22 years, this salary goes up to a maximum of $70,000 (\u00a348,500) for a classroom teacher. Among other public servants, at least the police have the satisfaction of being dubbed The Finest in the popular newspapers. It's just as well that they receive this recogition in return for their no-win jobs, because their starting pay is $31,305 a year, again below that for those new to the uniform in some of the doziest nooks in nearby Long Island. Five years later, assuming they have managed to avoid shooting someone dead without good reason, they will be on $51,987. But unless they acquire a more elevated rank, they can go no higher than $54,978 after 20 years. The Bravest - that would be the firefighters - start on $32,724 and move up to $49,023 after six years. And garbage collectors - amazingly known as The Strongest - start on $27,842 and hit the heights with $44,441 after five years, about $4,000 less than a teacher or a policeman. Of the other caring professions, social workers start on up to $34,000 and can hope for about $55,000 by the time they are supervisors, about eight years later. Their employers say that, due to the rewarding, vocational nature of their work, it can be almost impossible to get social workers to go home at night; or maybe it's because they can't face the long journey now that the average two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan costs about $750,000. The designer Calvin Klein would probably concede that his, too, is a rewarding calling, irrespective of his consideration of $21.5m a year. The same goes for Tommy Hilfiger and his $26.9m. Compensation for aesthetic services comes in all shapes and sizes in New York, as elsewhere. The soprano Renee Fleming receives $14,000 for a performance at the Metropolitan Opera, or just $900 below what the average actor makes in a year. The weekly minimum on a Broadway stage is $1,215 and in the orchestra pit $1,220. Apparently doctors believe that people have a warped notion of their earning power; but then it turns out that they would be hard-pushed to start on under $115,000 a year (and even more in other parts of the country, where there are fewer of them). Of course, this is nothing alongside the few who get to practise the closest thing there is to cerebral celebrity: evening television news show anchors on about $7m; financiers (name your millions); or successful real estate brokers (standard commission for residential properties 6%). But perhaps the reason most relatively normal people will say nothing about their salaries is because they just aren't quite as big as you'd like to believe.

The French have 'l'exception fran\u00e7aise'. The Germans have 'der deutsche Sonderweg'. The English, on the other hand, have no equivalent catchphrase: it seems they take their exceptionality so much for granted that they don't even bother putting a name to it. Does such a thing as 'Englishness' really exist? Most current thinking on national identities suggests that it doesn't. Apparently innate and immutable national characteristics, the argument goes, are mere illusion and representation, a funhouse mirror which shows observers nothing but distorted images of their own desires, fears and preconceptions. To think of these characteristics as 'real' is to indulge in the deadliest of present-day academic sins, 'essentialism', patriarchal godfather to racism, sexism and all other noxious 'isms'.</p> <p>This view is easy to ridicule. Even the most sternly post-modern cultural studies professor is likely to lapse into essentialism when confronting a rude Parisian shopkeeper, or a lazy Italian bureaucrat. Yet however obvious national differences appear at first glance, attempting to document them usually ends up looking silly as well. Take the recent scientific study, summarised in the Independent, which attempted to rank nations as more or less neurotic by measuring rates of suicide, crime, divorce and the consumption of alcohol and caffeine. The UK came out as the world's eighth most stable, extroverted nation (just ahead of Germany), while Hungary and France ranked as the most neurotic and introverted. The fact that the US came out as the nation in the best psychological health should perhaps have raised some doubts in the authors' minds about their methods.</p> <p>Given the empirical difficulty and political incorrectness involved in measuring national differences, it's no surprise that most historians have long since turned to studying the representations and stereotypes themselves. On one level, these have served to demonise and dehumanise foreigners, and to exclude unwanted groups from the national community. On another, they have promoted national unity and pride. Instilling the people with properly national characteristics has been a central preoccupation for educators, artists and scholars.</p> <p>There is a shoal of new cultural history books about such matters. They tend to proceed from the assumption that visions of national character are by nature multiple, variable and competing. Paul Langford begs to differ. In Englishness Identified, he admits that stereotypes of the English have often contradicted each other. The island race has been seen as alternately lazy and industrious, honest and hypocritical, polite and uncouth, taciturn and bombastic. He nonetheless insists that between the mid-17th and mid-19th centuries, these characterisations fell into distinctive patterns. The themes he identifies are energy, candour, decency, taciturnity, reserve and, of course, eccentricity. He does not go so far as to say that the themes reflected actual traits present in the English population. Rather, \"stereotypes resemble a kind of solera, to which each new pen adds but a drop.\" Observers saw, in other words, what they had been led to see, and helped others to see the same thing. The result was a recognisably English collection of traits.</p> <p>Langford sets out to prove his case in a robust, no-nonsense, thoroughly empirical manner (typically English, one might almost say). He has assembled a large database of descriptions of the English, above all by foreigners, analysed it and found his six common themes. He has further divided each theme into four to seven sub-themes, so that candour, for instance, is broken down into plainness, openness, separateness, domesticity, honesty and humbug. He has written up chapters and sub-chapters with these headings, illustrated them with a thousand illustrative quotations and paraphrases, thrown in a brief introduction and conclusion, and voil\u00e0 !</p> <p>His focus on England and Englishness, as opposed to Britain and Britishness, is timely. Earlier this summer, a leader in the Times attacked Tom Nairn, Eric Hobsbawm and especially Linda Colley for supplying a tendentious, politicised justification for the break-up of Britain. Citing a recent article by JCD Clark, the Times claimed that Britain and Britishness, far from being 'forged' largely in the 18th century as Colley claims, have deeper historical roots. Devolution, and the concurrent resurgence of 'English' nationalism are not therefore inevitable steps on the road to a decentralised, Europeanised Britain, but perverse attempts to cut against the grain of history. Langford's evidence, however, shows that the undeniable success 'Britain' enjoyed as a political concept never carried over very strongly into the realm of ethnic and cultural identification. \"It is difficult to discover any alleged British characteristic that does not in practice coincide with an alleged English characteristic,\" he observes, and adds that the word 'Britishness' did not appear until the late 19th century. The label 'Britain' applied to the state far more than it did to the people, who remained, for the most part, firmly Scots, Welsh, Irish or English. From this point of view, one of Colley's central arguments seems correct: as the religious and imperial justifications for having a powerful British state have faded away, what more natural than for the component pieces of the UK to reassert their individual identity?</p> <p>Langford has found some real gems in his vast mine of material. I learned, for example, that the word 'eccentricity' only entered into common circulation in the 1790s, and that 'silence is golden,' which I thought to be a quintessentially English proverb, is actually Swiss in origin (it was popularised in England by Carlyle). In 18th-century France, Langford has discovered, 'une conversation \u00e0 l'anglaise' was slang for a long silence. He also tells the story of the poet Samuel Rogers who, in 1815, asked a passerby on the streets of Paris, \"Are you an Englishman?\" and received the reply: \"Thank God I am, Sir.\" He quotes Washington Irving's wonderful description of the English traveller in Italy who had his servant prepare and serve his meals in his carriage: beefsteak, \"ketchup and soy, and Cayenne pepper, and Harvey sauce, and a bottle of port wine, from that warehouse the carriage, in which his master seemed desirous of carrying England about the world with him.\" In the 18th century, typical English cooking did not involve conscientiously boiling something to remove all traces of taste, but rather over-spicing it. We learn, too, about the French traveller Joseph Fi\u00e9v\u00e9e, who thought English women hypocritical for not receiving visitors in their bedrooms in the name of modesty, while rushing to their windows without shame to watch half-naked boxers. And there is Lord Castlereagh's reply to Mme de Stael's complaint that the English language had no equivalent for the French word sentiment: \"No, there is no English word, but the Irish have one that corresponds exactly - 'blarney'.\" Langford himself has a pleasantly dry wit, as in this comment on the supposed English aversion to kissing: \"Perhaps English men could sleep more secure in their beds when they were assured that the sexual sensibility of wives had not been precociously stimulated by frequent kissing in adolescence.\"</p> <p>Another favourite of mine is the story of the two Englishmen who, every day, at the same hour, adjourned to neighbouring 'shades', or stalls, alongside the Thames, to rest from their labours. For 27 years they did not exchange a single word. Then, one day, one of the men lifted his voice and said \"Sir, you and I have sat here with a board between us now for 27 years. May I venture to ask your name?\" The reply from the other side of the board was: \"Sir, you're a very impertinent fellow.\" The ingredients are good enough, but the finished product puts one in mind of a tasty bread made without enough yeast. Langford's style is fluid but all too unvarying. He tends to begin a paragraph by paraphrasing some commonly held view of the English: \"Removing the lower-class Englishman from his own environment evidently had the effect of loosening his moral moorings\"; \"The English were proud of their lack of vindictiveness\"; 'For the English the most savage war seemed a kind of patriotic game\"; \"There was a sense in which the English did not seem neglectful of their past.\" He provides a short discussion, four or five quotations, and then moves on to the next point. \"The majesty of English law also owed much to this sense of decency\"; \"English dress sense lacked flair and panache, but had a kind of solidity\"; \"The traditional image of the English was of excess and exhibitionism\"; \"The decency of Englishwomen had much to do with sexual mores.\"</p> <p>After a hundred pages or so of such relentless generalisation, the six themes flow into each other like watercolours under a shower (particularly taciturnity and reserve - half the quotations adduced for the one could serve the other equally well). Langford doesn't help matters by doing so little to put his source material in context. Joseph Fi\u00e9v\u00e9e, for instance, was a French hack journalist and intellectual, of elastic political loyalties, who might have walked out of the pages of Balzac's Lost Illusions. Here, however, he's left as a disembodied voice talking about the English, and Langford does the same with nearly all his other sources. It would no doubt have inflated the book beyond reasonable measure to deal adequately even with the French, and the rich brew of jealousy, admiration, distaste and resentment which fed into their collective attitudes towards England, to say nothing of their individual biases and passions. The French historian Edmond Dziembowski's excellent monograph, Un nouveau patriotisme fran\u00e7ais (not cited by Langford) takes over five hundred pages to discuss French attitudes towards Britain during the period 1750-70 alone. But Langford hardly deals with his sources' national contexts at all, and misses some of the best French material altogether (such as Robert Martin Lesuire's corrosively funny 1760 novel Les Sauvages de l'Europe, a virtual catalogue of anti-English stereotypes). And without contextualisation, the observers, like the observed, blend together into a homogeneous mass.</p> <p>This problem undermines Langford's general conclusions. He has worked hard to uncover the broad outlines of 'Englishness', but at the expense of identifying the changes which, in the end, are of greatest interest. At the start, he suggests a general shift in a typical Englishman from barbaric fanatic at the time of Charles I's execution to vigorous, civilised entrepreneur two hundred years later. He also makes the (not entirely surprising) assertion that images of the English as lazy became less frequent during the Industrial Revolution. Yet he never follows up on these remarks in any systematic manner, and undercuts them by juxtaposing quotations from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In the end, 'Englishness' emerges from the book as curiously static, despite the fact that between 1650 and 1850 England changed from a predominantly rural, isolated, heavily religious country dominated by the aristocracy into a quasi-democratic, increasingly urban and secular industrial society, and the centre of a worldwide empire. Langford has little to say about these transformations, especially the last. His European and American sources have observed the English in their native habitat, and as tourists abroad, but not as soldiers, sailors and imperial bureaucrats, the capacities in which most of the world knew them.</p> <p>Similarly, Langford has relatively little to say about disagreements over Englishness, and what was at stake in them. He says he prefers to quote foreigners because of \"the likelihood that if their testimony is not objective, it is at least disengaged\". But it is hard to think of French observers, for example, as particularly disengaged, given how much of the period they spent at war with Britain. Even in peacetime, memories of multiple defeats and other aspects of the perennial rivalry indelibly coloured their perceptions. But Langford deals as little with international conflict as he does with empire. Otherwise he might have remarked that the exchange \"Are you an Englishman?\" - \"Thank God, I am, Sir!\" would have been more telling had it taken place in Copenhagen in 1820, rather than in Paris in the year of Waterloo. His preference for amusing and quotable observations, as opposed to angry or ideological ones, obscures the extent to which Englishness was a contested terrain. Many foreigners - the Highlanders after Culloden, or the Mahrattas after Assaye, for example - did not actually perceive the English as attractively John Mortimerish compounds of energy, candour and decency, but as something altogether less benign.</p> <p>It is instructive to compare Englishness Identified with Ian Buruma's recent book, Voltaire's Coconuts, to which an American publisher has given the more bland but descriptive title Anglomania. Buruma did only a small fraction of Langford's research and his impressionistic, personal survey of admiring attitudes towards England, from Voltaire's France to Major's England, lacks Langford's scholarly rigour. But he has a keen eye for the sort of anecdote which reveals more than a long page of quotations and he gives a strong, clear sense of his sources' backgrounds and outlook. Most important, he evokes how these men and women, including his own parents' Dutch and Jewish families, responded to England as a model and as a refuge. He also provides a savage account of the 'young fogies' who gathered around Charles Moore's Spectator in the 1980s, trying and succeeding to become walking parodies of the most blimpishly insular sort of Englishman. I can think of few better illustrations of the way national stereotypes are shaped and reinforced.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

From this point of view, one of Colley's central arguments seems correct: as the religious and imperial justifications for having a powerful British state have faded away, what more natural than for the component pieces of the UK to reassert their individual identity? Langford has found some real gems in his vast mine of material. I learned, for example, that the word 'eccentricity' only entered into common circulation in the 1790s, and that 'silence is golden,' which I thought to be a quintessentially English proverb, is actually Swiss in origin (it was popularised in England by Carlyle). In 18th-century France, Langford has discovered, 'une conversation \u00e0 l'anglaise' was slang for a long silence. He also tells the story of the poet Samuel Rogers who, in 1815, asked a passerby on the streets of Paris, \"Are you an Englishman?\" and received the reply: \"Thank God I am, Sir.\" He quotes Washington Irving's wonderful description of the English traveller in Italy who had his servant prepare and serve his meals in his carriage: beefsteak, \"ketchup and soy, and Cayenne pepper, and Harvey sauce, and a bottle of port wine, from that warehouse the carriage, in which his master seemed desirous of carrying England about the world with him.\" In the 18th century, typical English cooking did not involve conscientiously boiling something to remove all traces of taste, but rather over-spicing it. We learn, too, about the French traveller Joseph Fi\u00e9v\u00e9e, who thought English women hypocritical for not receiving visitors in their bedrooms in the name of modesty, while rushing to their windows without shame to watch half-naked boxers. And there is Lord Castlereagh's reply to Mme de Stael's complaint that the English language had no equivalent for the French word sentiment: \"No, there is no English word, but the Irish have one that corresponds exactly - 'blarney'.\" Langford himself has a pleasantly dry wit, as in this comment on the supposed English aversion to kissing: \"Perhaps English men could sleep more secure in their beds when they were assured that the sexual sensibility of wives had not been precociously stimulated by frequent kissing in adolescence.\" Another favourite of mine is the story of the two Englishmen who, every day, at the same hour, adjourned to neighbouring 'shades', or stalls, alongside the Thames, to rest from their labours. For 27 years they did not exchange a single word. Then, one day, one of the men lifted his voice and said \"Sir, you and I have sat here with a board between us now for 27 years. May I venture to ask your name?\" The reply from the other side of the board was: \"Sir, you're a very impertinent fellow.\" The ingredients are good enough, but the finished product puts one in mind of a tasty bread made without enough yeast. Langford's style is fluid but all too unvarying. He tends to begin a paragraph by paraphrasing some commonly held view of the English: \"Removing the lower-class Englishman from his own environment evidently had the effect of loosening his moral moorings\"; \"The English were proud of their lack of vindictiveness\"; 'For the English the most savage war seemed a kind of patriotic game\"; \"There was a sense in which the English did not seem neglectful of their past.\" He provides a short discussion, four or five quotations, and then moves on to the next point. \"The majesty of English law also owed much to this sense of decency\"; \"English dress sense lacked flair and panache, but had a kind of solidity\"; \"The traditional image of the English was of excess and exhibitionism\"; \"The decency of Englishwomen had much to do with sexual mores.\" After a hundred pages or so of such relentless generalisation, the six themes flow into each other like watercolours under a shower (particularly taciturnity and reserve - half the quotations adduced for the one could serve the other equally well). Langford doesn't help matters by doing so little to put his source material in context. Joseph Fi\u00e9v\u00e9e, for instance, was a French hack journalist and intellectual, of elastic political loyalties, who might have walked out of the pages of Balzac's Lost Illusions. Here, however, he's left as a disembodied voice talking about the English, and Langford does the same with nearly all his other sources. It would no doubt have inflated the book beyond reasonable measure to deal adequately even with the French, and the rich brew of jealousy, admiration, distaste and resentment which fed into their collective attitudes towards England, to say nothing of their individual biases and passions. The French historian Edmond Dziembowski's excellent monograph, Un nouveau patriotisme fran\u00e7ais (not cited by Langford) takes over five hundred pages to discuss French attitudes towards Britain during the period 1750-70 alone. But Langford hardly deals with his sources' national contexts at all, and misses some of the best French material altogether (such as Robert Martin Lesuire's corrosively funny 1760 novel Les Sauvages de l'Europe, a virtual catalogue of anti-English stereotypes). And without contextualisation, the observers, like the observed, blend together into a homogeneous mass. This problem undermines Langford's general conclusions. He has worked hard to uncover the broad outlines of 'Englishness', but at the expense of identifying the changes which, in the end, are of greatest interest. At the start, he suggests a general shift in a typical Englishman from barbaric fanatic at the time of Charles I's execution to vigorous, civilised entrepreneur two hundred years later. He also makes the (not entirely surprising) assertion that images of the English as lazy became less frequent during the Industrial Revolution. Yet he never follows up on these remarks in any systematic manner, and undercuts them by juxtaposing quotations from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. In the end, 'Englishness' emerges from the book as curiously static, despite the fact that between 1650 and 1850 England changed from a predominantly rural, isolated, heavily religious country dominated by the aristocracy into a quasi-democratic, increasingly urban and secular industrial society, and the centre of a worldwide empire. Langford has little to say about these transformations, especially the last. His European and American sources have observed the English in their native habitat, and as tourists abroad, but not as soldiers, sailors and imperial bureaucrats, the capacities in which most of the world knew them. Similarly, Langford has relatively little to say about disagreements over Englishness, and what was at stake in them. He says he prefers to quote foreigners because of \"the likelihood that if their testimony is not objective, it is at least disengaged\". But it is hard to think of French observers, for example, as particularly disengaged, given how much of the period they spent at war with Britain. Even in peacetime, memories of multiple defeats and other aspects of the perennial rivalry indelibly coloured their perceptions. But Langford deals as little with international conflict as he does with empire. Otherwise he might have remarked that the exchange \"Are you an Englishman?\" - \"Thank God, I am, Sir!\" would have been more telling had it taken place in Copenhagen in 1820, rather than in Paris in the year of Waterloo. His preference for amusing and quotable observations, as opposed to angry or ideological ones, obscures the extent to which Englishness was a contested terrain. Many foreigners - the Highlanders after Culloden, or the Mahrattas after Assaye, for example - did not actually perceive the English as attractively John Mortimerish compounds of energy, candour and decency, but as something altogether less benign. It is instructive to compare Englishness Identified with Ian Buruma's recent book, Voltaire's Coconuts, to which an American publisher has given the more bland but descriptive title Anglomania. Buruma did only a small fraction of Langford's research and his impressionistic, personal survey of admiring attitudes towards England, from Voltaire's France to Major's England, lacks Langford's scholarly rigour. But he has a keen eye for the sort of anecdote which reveals more than a long page of quotations and he gives a strong, clear sense of his sources' backgrounds and outlook. Most important, he evokes how these men and women, including his own parents' Dutch and Jewish families, responded to England as a model and as a refuge. He also provides a savage account of the 'young fogies' who gathered around Charles Moore's Spectator in the 1980s, trying and succeeding to become walking parodies of the most blimpishly insular sort of Englishman. I can think of few better illustrations of the way national stereotypes are shaped and reinforced. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

The drums!\" Now the drums have come rather closer to home but still the beleaguered adventurer is crying: \"It's the drums I can't stand!\"</p> <p>The location this time is Venice, the sea-side playground of Los Angeles, which at weekends is the home of probably a wider variety of races, ages, sexes, sexual persuasions, sizes, colours, fashions, belief systems, tattoos and artistic notions regularly assembled anywhere in the world.</p> <p>Along the walkway is everyone from Peruvian singers to Chinese masseuses, Nevadan weight-lifters to Indian mystics with a smattering of LA gang style kings, out-of-state-tourists, sexologists, musclemen, stand-up comedians, preachers, psychics, psychos and sidekicks.</p> <p>One enduring feature for the last 40 years has been the drum circle which is open to all comers who want to play or listen and keeps up its beat throughout the weekend days until the sun dips down over the Pacific.</p> <p>But now the drums are under threat. Some beachfront residents have started to complain that the noise is so great that they have to move off their decks and entertain their guests inside their beachfront houses. Others claim that it is just a damn cacophony and much too close to residential areas.</p> <p>At the heart of the problem is that, as Venice becomes more fashionable, people are moving in from other areas in the city and do not always like what they see or, in this case, hear. Matters reached a head when the police were approached last month by a small group of residents who suggested that the drummers were in breach of a city noise ordinance and should be moved from their current site.</p> <p>The drummers are fighting back. \"The enemy is not the city officials and the police per se,\" says the circle's website which is put together by Sandra Tatum, \"but the narrow-minded uncompromising attitude of some individuals who think they can dictate their own selfish agendas against the wishes of the whole community they purportedly belong to.</p> <p>\"If the character of the community is not to your liking, it's time to rent a u-haul truck...These people will not stop complaining. We are a nation of complainers - people who abuse their freedom, unable to enjoy life, and make others' lives miserable.\"</p> <p>The residents who have complained say that they do not want to close the circle, as it were, merely move it down the beach and away from the houses. But the drummers say that the whole point of the circle is to have it where it can be seen and heard and joined by passers-by.</p> <p>The drummers and their supporters have responded to the challenge by getting together a petition of 10,000 signatures. Compromise may yet be reached and this weekend will be a test of whether the drums are to be silenced.</p> <p>The police, who patrol the area on bicycles, wearing nifty shorts and cycle helmets, are far from anxious to have another confrontation to add to all their current problems. And the last people they want to take on are surely those who march to the beat of a different drum.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:duncan.campbell@theguardian.com\"> duncan.campbell@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/0,2759,376727,00.html\">US election race</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usguns/0,2759,182056,00.html\">Gun violence in America</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28duncan+campbell%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=duncan+campbell&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Duncan Campbell</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.laweekly.com/\" target=\"_new\">LA Weekly</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dailynewslosangeles.com/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Daily News</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cityofla.org/\" target=\"_new\">City authority site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.Channel2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">KCBS Los Angeles TV</a><br><a href=\"http://www.lapdonline.org/\" target=\"_new\">Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hollywood.com/\" target=\"_new\">Hollywood.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the great old film cliches that Hollywood gave the world was that famous cry from beleaguered white explorers in Africa: \"It's the drums I can't stand! The drums!\" Now the drums have come rather closer to home but still the beleaguered adventurer is crying: \"It's the drums I can't stand!\" The location this time is Venice, the sea-side playground of Los Angeles, which at weekends is the home of probably a wider variety of races, ages, sexes, sexual persuasions, sizes, colours, fashions, belief systems, tattoos and artistic notions regularly assembled anywhere in the world. Along the walkway is everyone from Peruvian singers to Chinese masseuses, Nevadan weight-lifters to Indian mystics with a smattering of LA gang style kings, out-of-state-tourists, sexologists, musclemen, stand-up comedians, preachers, psychics, psychos and sidekicks. One enduring feature for the last 40 years has been the drum circle which is open to all comers who want to play or listen and keeps up its beat throughout the weekend days until the sun dips down over the Pacific. But now the drums are under threat. Some beachfront residents have started to complain that the noise is so great that they have to move off their decks and entertain their guests inside their beachfront houses. Others claim that it is just a damn cacophony and much too close to residential areas. At the heart of the problem is that, as Venice becomes more fashionable, people are moving in from other areas in the city and do not always like what they see or, in this case, hear. Matters reached a head when the police were approached last month by a small group of residents who suggested that the drummers were in breach of a city noise ordinance and should be moved from their current site. The drummers are fighting back. \"The enemy is not the city officials and the police per se,\" says the circle's website which is put together by Sandra Tatum, \"but the narrow-minded uncompromising attitude of some individuals who think they can dictate their own selfish agendas against the wishes of the whole community they purportedly belong to. \"If the character of the community is not to your liking, it's time to rent a u-haul truck...These people will not stop complaining. We are a nation of complainers - people who abuse their freedom, unable to enjoy life, and make others' lives miserable.\" The residents who have complained say that they do not want to close the circle, as it were, merely move it down the beach and away from the houses. But the drummers say that the whole point of the circle is to have it where it can be seen and heard and joined by passers-by. The drummers and their supporters have responded to the challenge by getting together a petition of 10,000 signatures. Compromise may yet be reached and this weekend will be a test of whether the drums are to be silenced. The police, who patrol the area on bicycles, wearing nifty shorts and cycle helmets, are far from anxious to have another confrontation to add to all their current problems. And the last people they want to take on are surely those who march to the beat of a different drum.

      "body": "<p>Father Christmas isn't noted for being particularly gadget-savvy. He's obviously well up on the socks and underpants market, but not so hot on MP3 players and digital cameras. </p> <p>To help you point him in the right direction we have created our very own virtual stocking crammed with hi-tech toys. </p> <p>It includes what we believe to be the year's best gadgets. Some are great value products that will last years. Others will be gathering dust in your loft by this time next year. But however you use them, they are guaranteed to give you much more fun this Christmas than another bottle of dodgy after-shave. </p> <p><strong> Mobile phones</strong><br> Throughout 2000, the major phone companies paraded futuristic-looking concept mobiles designed to make the most of the forthcoming super-fast 3G networks. </p> <p>Arguably a more honest glimpse of the future was provided by an actual product launched in late Summer. Ericsson's \u00a3300 R-380 smart phone married the Symbian operating system to a clever touch-screen and at a stroke made many of its rivals seem a tad old fashioned. For once a phone that promised simple to operate email, web browsing and PDA functionality lived up to its billing. </p> <p>Next year Nokia will attempt to re-capture lost ground with the latest version of its Communicator phones. The 9210 keeps its predecessor's keyboard, but adds a colour screen, Symbian's Epoc operating system, and, if you are using the Orange network's High Speed Circuit Switch Data (HSCSD) system, faster download times than standard GSM. </p> <p>2000 was also the year that the Japanese finally made good their promise to take a serious crack at the world's mobile phone market. Sony unveiled two innovative and stylish models, one of which, the \u00a330 CMD-J5, is arguably the most sensibly designed out of the basic Wap models. However, Panasonic's GD-93 phone is our Wap model of the year. It is stylish, sports a large screen, and has a fun selection of ring-tones (you can also record your own). Best of all, it lets you access your existing email account rather than be lumbered with a new one offered by your network. Motorola's newly launched \u00a3100 Timeport Ti250 and Philips' \u00a3100 Xenium 9@9 Wap, which uses voice activation to fire up its web browser, also merit further attention. </p> <p><strong> MP3</strong></p> <p> 2000 was the year that MP3 personal audio players went from being the preserve of PC geeks to a serious option for any discerning music fan. </p> <p>This year's best-sounding model was undoubtedly the long-awaited Sony Memory Stick Walkman, the \u00a3300 NW-MS7. However, its daft copyright protection software, which almost makes you feel as though you are committing a minor crime every time you use it, prevents it from receiving a warmer recommendation. Our favourite player is the \u00a3230 Samsung YP-Neu 64, a dinky little number wrapped in an I-Mac-style translucent finish which paired a quality performance with 64MB of embedded memory. Other models worth listening to include the \u00a3220 Philips Rush, LG's \u00a3180 MF-PD360 and the \u00a3160 Rio 600. </p> <p>Next year look out for units with MP3 encoders like the \u00a3300 Aiwa MM-FX500 that can record directly from CDs with no need to use a PC. </p> <p><strong> Personal audio </strong><br> Since the summer, the UK has been flooded with personal audio players touting mini hard disks that promise to store half of your CD collection in one brick-like box. Some, like the \u00a3350 Neo 25 which boasts an enormous 12 gigabyte hard drive, work reasonably well. Others are so flaky that getting them to play back any kind of music seems like a major achievement. </p> <p>An easier and cheaper solution is to invest in a personal CD player that also plays CD-Roms with MP3 files, such as the \u00a3200 eXpanium from Philips. You can burn up to 850MB of music (over 200 average length tunes on MP3) on one \u00a31.50 CD-R disc. Even the Argos-friendly Goodmans has got in on the act. Its CDMP-350 plays MP3-loaded CD-roms yet retails for around \u00a380. </p> <p><strong> Digital cameras</strong><br> The digital camera world appears to be splintering between serious mega-pixel fixated photographers and gadget-fans out to impress their more gullible friends. However, both groups gave an enormous thumbs up to the \u00a3600 Canon Digital Ixus which, in spite of its lovely chrome finish and pocketable size, is actually capable of high resolution images. </p> <p>Almost as sexy is Fuji's \u00a3700 Finepix 4700 Zoom, which integrated an excellent quality camera into the kind of gadget you'd imagine James Bond touting in the 60s. </p> <p>Serious camera enthusiasts will probably prefer the \u00a3800 Olympus C-3030Z - a digital model with the look, feel and many of the features of an analogue SLR. </p> <p>2000 was also the year the digital camera crashed through the \u00a3100 price barrier with companies such as Jenoptik, Kodak and Agfa unveiling web-friendly budget models. Samung's \u00a3250 SDC-80 is another camera sure to feature on many Christmas wishlists. It may only be modestly specified, but with its funky translucent orange finish it sure is cute. </p> <p><strong> Consumer electronics</strong><br> In the CE world 2000 will be remembered as the year that the TiVo personal video recorder arrived in the UK. Yet despite the amazing tricks, including a highly intelligent programme guide which among other things guesses what you want to watch and records it for you, the TiVo system has not exactly had people queuing in the rain outside Dixons. </p> <p>Perhaps its \u00a3600 price tag has something to do with it. </p> <p>Don't expect the hard disk/personal video system technology to go away though. Next year Pace will launch a Sky Digital decoder which offers both an intelligent hard disk recording system and two tuners (for watching one channel while recording another). </p> <p>JVC is also set to bring its hard disk/S-VHS combi recorder to the UK, while home cinema fans dream of the day Toshiba's hard disk/DVD-ram recorder lands on these shores. </p> <p><strong> DVD</strong><br> Undoubtedly this year's success story, sales of both players and discs have gone stratospheric - apparently the DVD movie of Gladiator sold more last week than the number one CD single by Destiny's Child. </p> <p>Among our favourites is the \u00a3400 Toshiba SD-200E courtesy of an excellent performance, a comprehensive roll call of facilities, and a very sensible price. </p> <p>If you are feeling naughty, consider the Chinese-made \u00a3180 Mico DVD-A980 from <a href=\"http://www.unbeatable.co.uk\">www.unbeatable.co.uk</a>. Not only will it play back imported American \"Region Two\" discs as well as standard European ones, it can also spin MP3-laden CD-roms. </p> <p>The hi-fi fraternity has been drooling over the performance of the \u00a3800 British-made Arcam DV88, while for gadget-fans there's little to rival the DVD personal and mini screen of the \u00a3800 Sony DVP-FX1. </p> <p><strong> Gadgets</strong><br> 2000 was tipped as being the year of the watch with companies promising mobile phones, personal organisers and even music players integrated into a timepiece. The one company that delivered was Casio, whose amazing MP3 watch (the \u00a3280 WMP-1 ) and digital camera watch (the \u00a3200 WQV-1) were among the year's grooviest gadgets. </p> <p>Even more fun than the camera watch was the Spypen, an \u00a380 ballpoint-shaped digital camera from <a href=\"http://www.plawa.de\">Plawa</a>, which is sure to get a great deal of use in the next few weeks capturing Christmas parties shenanigans. </p> <p>Two internet-friendly gadgets also caught the eye. Ricoh's \u00a31,000 RDC-1700, a top-end digital camera with a cool 70s styling that allows you to peruse web pages via its 3.5inch LCD screen and instantly email images, would be a must were it not so pricey. More of a bargain is Bush's Net TV, which at \u00a3180 a set is sure to bring the wonders of the web to many new homes this Christmas.</p>",

Others are so flaky that getting them to play back any kind of music seems like a major achievement. An easier and cheaper solution is to invest in a personal CD player that also plays CD-Roms with MP3 files, such as the \u00a3200 eXpanium from Philips. You can burn up to 850MB of music (over 200 average length tunes on MP3) on one \u00a31.50 CD-R disc. Even the Argos-friendly Goodmans has got in on the act. Its CDMP-350 plays MP3-loaded CD-roms yet retails for around \u00a380. Digital cameras The digital camera world appears to be splintering between serious mega-pixel fixated photographers and gadget-fans out to impress their more gullible friends. However, both groups gave an enormous thumbs up to the \u00a3600 Canon Digital Ixus which, in spite of its lovely chrome finish and pocketable size, is actually capable of high resolution images. Almost as sexy is Fuji's \u00a3700 Finepix 4700 Zoom, which integrated an excellent quality camera into the kind of gadget you'd imagine James Bond touting in the 60s. Serious camera enthusiasts will probably prefer the \u00a3800 Olympus C-3030Z - a digital model with the look, feel and many of the features of an analogue SLR. 2000 was also the year the digital camera crashed through the \u00a3100 price barrier with companies such as Jenoptik, Kodak and Agfa unveiling web-friendly budget models. Samung's \u00a3250 SDC-80 is another camera sure to feature on many Christmas wishlists. It may only be modestly specified, but with its funky translucent orange finish it sure is cute. Consumer electronics In the CE world 2000 will be remembered as the year that the TiVo personal video recorder arrived in the UK. Yet despite the amazing tricks, including a highly intelligent programme guide which among other things guesses what you want to watch and records it for you, the TiVo system has not exactly had people queuing in the rain outside Dixons. Perhaps its \u00a3600 price tag has something to do with it. Don't expect the hard disk/personal video system technology to go away though. Next year Pace will launch a Sky Digital decoder which offers both an intelligent hard disk recording system and two tuners (for watching one channel while recording another). JVC is also set to bring its hard disk/S-VHS combi recorder to the UK, while home cinema fans dream of the day Toshiba's hard disk/DVD-ram recorder lands on these shores. DVD Undoubtedly this year's success story, sales of both players and discs have gone stratospheric - apparently the DVD movie of Gladiator sold more last week than the number one CD single by Destiny's Child. Among our favourites is the \u00a3400 Toshiba SD-200E courtesy of an excellent performance, a comprehensive roll call of facilities, and a very sensible price. If you are feeling naughty, consider the Chinese-made \u00a3180 Mico DVD-A980 from www.unbeatable.co.uk. Not only will it play back imported American \"Region Two\" discs as well as standard European ones, it can also spin MP3-laden CD-roms. The hi-fi fraternity has been drooling over the performance of the \u00a3800 British-made Arcam DV88, while for gadget-fans there's little to rival the DVD personal and mini screen of the \u00a3800 Sony DVP-FX1. Gadgets 2000 was tipped as being the year of the watch with companies promising mobile phones, personal organisers and even music players integrated into a timepiece. The one company that delivered was Casio, whose amazing MP3 watch (the \u00a3280 WMP-1 ) and digital camera watch (the \u00a3200 WQV-1) were among the year's grooviest gadgets. Even more fun than the camera watch was the Spypen, an \u00a380 ballpoint-shaped digital camera from Plawa, which is sure to get a great deal of use in the next few weeks capturing Christmas parties shenanigans. Two internet-friendly gadgets also caught the eye. Ricoh's \u00a31,000 RDC-1700, a top-end digital camera with a cool 70s styling that allows you to peruse web pages via its 3.5inch LCD screen and instantly email images, would be a must were it not so pricey. More of a bargain is Bush's Net TV, which at \u00a3180 a set is sure to bring the wonders of the web to many new homes this Christmas.",

      "body": "<p>Last weekend my boyfriend and I took a wrong turning in a major department store and found ourselves in the toy department - for about five seconds. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. </p> <p>Children were screaming, shouting, and waving toys around. The adults weren't much better. My boyfriend has now vowed to do all his Christmas shopping online. And this set me thinking, can you celebrate Christmas on the internet without having to go out and face the crowds, or indeed unwanted relatives? </p> <p>The answer, happily, is yes. You will never have to elbow your way to the front of the queue again, or sit next to the man who is tone deaf during a carol service. </p> <p>Shopping is the first hurdle to get over. According to a new survey from BlueCarrots, three quarters of internet users will shop online this Christmas, compared with a third last year. The difference, apparently, is that we're no longer scared of someone making off with our Barclaycard number and running up a huge bill with it. </p> <p>So where do you go for Christmas goodies? Father Christmas of course. At <a href=\"http://www.santa.claus.com\">www.santa.claus.com</a> you'll find six floors of gifts, toys, games, sweets and decorations. These include stocking fillers such as gold, frankincense and myrrh or essential oils for \u00a312.99, through to a fake white Colorado Christmas tree for \u00a319.99 and a five-piece Santa suit for \u00a324.99. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.christmas.co.uk\">www.christmas.co.uk</a>, you can email Santa asking him to phone your child with a special Christmas message, just for \u00a35. Or, if you want to be particularly mean, Santa can be recruited to play Scrooge, placing an unseasonal call to your boss. If you've had a hard year at work, this may seem like \u00a35 well spent. </p> <p>While in a Lapland frame of mind, book a sleigh ride (though obviously, you'll have to leave the house for the real thing). <a href=\"http://www.sleighrides.com\">www.sleighrides.com</a> provides a 40-minute sleigh ride with a stop for hot chocolate for about \u00a353 per person. If your taste runs to something a tad speedier than a reindeer, then you could try a four-hour snowmobile ride (including lunch) for around \u00a3110. However, to take advantage of this offer you will first have to get to the Adirondack mountains in New York State. </p> <p>Back indoors, it's time to decorate your house. At <a href=\"http://www.sun-sentinel.com\">www.sun-sentinel.com</a>, the Bossack Family will sell you the dream Christmas tree and deliver it to your home. A 6ft Douglas fir will set you back \u00a363. </p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.hillier.hants.gov.uk\">www.hillier.hants.gov.uk</a>, you can check out Christmas decoration and wreath making workshops over the next fortnight, costing \u00a327.50. </p> <p>And of course, there's endless scope for Christmas kitsch. My particular favourites come from <a href=\"http://www.bronners.com\">www.bronners.com</a>, which sells a 14 inch fibre optic angel for \u00a340 and a fibre optic red poinsettia, which is unbelievably nasty, for \u00a334. </p> <p>What about Christmas lunch? My boyfriend tells me that he likes a slow-cooked giant ham and roast beef. The thought of stinking the house out with these is too much. So, I turn to <a href=\"http://www.balduccis.com\">www.balduccis.com</a>, which will bring Christmas dinner to the door. You get the full works for a family of four (except the Christmas pudding) for \u00a385. This is excellent for meat eaters, but there is no vegetarian option. </p> <p>Does the internet provide an opportunity to go to church without having to enter a cold, dimly-lit building? From this week it does, in the shape of <a href=\"http://www.church.co.uk\">www.church.co.uk</a>, founded by TV vicar, Steve Chalke. </p> <p>The site, shaped like a house (the house of God, get it?) currently includes Bible readings, prayers, a talk about how to cope with the stress of Christmas, a post-Christmas work out with Rosemary Conley, and even advice on how to stuff a turkey. </p> <p>And according to Chalke, events are being planned around the UK for web lovers to attend Christmas celebrations \"in pubs and clubs\". Online events are also planned for the festive season. And all of the cyber vicar's sermons are up for debate by those visiting the site, which is less embarrassing than picking an argument with a priest in a pulpit. </p> <p>Chalke says: \" <a href=\"http://www.church.co.uk\">www.church.co.uk</a> is for people who are searching spiritually, but they don't think that the church down the road has the answers, though they will explore the net. </p> <p>\"It helps people because they are anonymous. No one will want to invite you for tea in a cracked cup and shake your hand. </p> <p>\"There's nobody under 30 who doesn't think in terms of spirituality. We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.\" </p> <p>So that's my Christmas fixed up. At least it would have been if I hadn't already bought most of my presents and been invited out for several meals. Next year I'll have my Christmas on the net.</p>",

My boyfriend has now vowed to do all his Christmas shopping online. And this set me thinking, can you celebrate Christmas on the internet without having to go out and face the crowds, or indeed unwanted relatives? The answer, happily, is yes. You will never have to elbow your way to the front of the queue again, or sit next to the man who is tone deaf during a carol service. Shopping is the first hurdle to get over. According to a new survey from BlueCarrots, three quarters of internet users will shop online this Christmas, compared with a third last year. The difference, apparently, is that we're no longer scared of someone making off with our Barclaycard number and running up a huge bill with it. So where do you go for Christmas goodies? Father Christmas of course. At www.santa.claus.com you'll find six floors of gifts, toys, games, sweets and decorations. These include stocking fillers such as gold, frankincense and myrrh or essential oils for \u00a312.99, through to a fake white Colorado Christmas tree for \u00a319.99 and a five-piece Santa suit for \u00a324.99. At www.christmas.co.uk, you can email Santa asking him to phone your child with a special Christmas message, just for \u00a35. Or, if you want to be particularly mean, Santa can be recruited to play Scrooge, placing an unseasonal call to your boss. If you've had a hard year at work, this may seem like \u00a35 well spent. While in a Lapland frame of mind, book a sleigh ride (though obviously, you'll have to leave the house for the real thing). www.sleighrides.com provides a 40-minute sleigh ride with a stop for hot chocolate for about \u00a353 per person. If your taste runs to something a tad speedier than a reindeer, then you could try a four-hour snowmobile ride (including lunch) for around \u00a3110. However, to take advantage of this offer you will first have to get to the Adirondack mountains in New York State. Back indoors, it's time to decorate your house. At www.sun-sentinel.com, the Bossack Family will sell you the dream Christmas tree and deliver it to your home. A 6ft Douglas fir will set you back \u00a363. At www.hillier.hants.gov.uk, you can check out Christmas decoration and wreath making workshops over the next fortnight, costing \u00a327.50. And of course, there's endless scope for Christmas kitsch. My particular favourites come from www.bronners.com, which sells a 14 inch fibre optic angel for \u00a340 and a fibre optic red poinsettia, which is unbelievably nasty, for \u00a334. What about Christmas lunch? My boyfriend tells me that he likes a slow-cooked giant ham and roast beef. The thought of stinking the house out with these is too much. So, I turn to www.balduccis.com, which will bring Christmas dinner to the door. You get the full works for a family of four (except the Christmas pudding) for \u00a385. This is excellent for meat eaters, but there is no vegetarian option. Does the internet provide an opportunity to go to church without having to enter a cold, dimly-lit building? From this week it does, in the shape of www.church.co.uk, founded by TV vicar, Steve Chalke. The site, shaped like a house (the house of God, get it?) currently includes Bible readings, prayers, a talk about how to cope with the stress of Christmas, a post-Christmas work out with Rosemary Conley, and even advice on how to stuff a turkey. And according to Chalke, events are being planned around the UK for web lovers to attend Christmas celebrations \"in pubs and clubs\". Online events are also planned for the festive season. And all of the cyber vicar's sermons are up for debate by those visiting the site, which is less embarrassing than picking an argument with a priest in a pulpit. Chalke says: \" www.church.co.uk is for people who are searching spiritually, but they don't think that the church down the road has the answers, though they will explore the net. \"It helps people because they are anonymous. No one will want to invite you for tea in a cracked cup and shake your hand. \"There's nobody under 30 who doesn't think in terms of spirituality. We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience.\" So that's my Christmas fixed up. At least it would have been if I hadn't already bought most of my presents and been invited out for several meals. Next year I'll have my Christmas on the net.",

The judge, Peter Salmon, dismissed MoD claims that the book, Soldier 5, being published in New Zealand by a New Zealander who uses the pseudonym Mike Coburn, could jeopardise the security of future SAS operations. His ruling, like the Spycatcher affair, has widespread implications for the writers of other books on the security and intelligence agencies, not least Stella Rimington, the former head of MI5. TheMoD, with MI6, has led the attack on Dame Stella for her decision to write her memoirs, citing the precedent it would give former SAS soldiers. She has agreed to redraft some passages but insists she has the right under the Human Rights Act to publish a personal memoir. \"The Ministry of Defence has used its power to issue orders for the improper purpose of restricting the defendant's right to freedom of speech and expression,\" said Mr Justice Salmon in Auckland. He ruled that Mr Coburn was subjected to \"illegitimate\" economic pressure to sign a confidentiality agreement, after the MoD threatened to force him out of the SAS, and relinquish its special pay scales, if he refused to sign the lifetime ban. During the hearing, much of it held behind closed doors, MoD witnesses, including the head of the SAS, warned that the publication of Soldier 5 could jeopardise the integrity of its confidentiality clause. The botched Bravo Two Zero mission has already inspired two bestselling accounts, by patrol leader Andy McNab and another member, Chris Ryan, the only one of the eight man team to have escaped. Both soldiers had left the force by the time the MoD introduced a confidentiality agreement for special forces soldiers in 1996, designed to prevent the publication of further accounts of undercover missions without the permission of senior officers. A spate of earlier books by former SAS soldiers were written after the authors voluntarily submitted manuscripts to the MoD for vetting. During open sessions in court, Mr Coburn, 36, accused senior officers of issuing the Bravo Two Zero patrol with faulty equipment, dropping it too close to enemy lines, and delaying a rescue attempt because the men were \"expendable\". He said he wanted to restore the reputation of Vince Phillips, a member of the SAS patrol whose suitability for the task has been criticised by one of the patrol team as well as in a leaked SAS report. The New Zealand ruling also has significant implications for the MoD's attempts to suppress books about undercover operations in Northern Ireland.

In a sense, writing theory and making films is one and the same thing for me.\" Still, that's Assayas for you. Wispy post modern fancy or sprawling modernist epic. Writing about films or making them. The man offers living proof that you can do the lot.",

      "body": "<p>For all their omnipotence in the Premiership and the carefree abandon with which they are strutting towards their seventh title in nine years, Manchester United have waited a long time for this moment. </p> <p>Unspectacular yet effective, Sir Alex Ferguson's team rediscovered the winning formula in Europe here last night, bolstering their challenge for a fifth successive Champions League quarter-final with their first victory on foreign soil for nine months. </p> <p>They are now two points clear in Group A courtesy of a goal in each half from Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs - in the type of controlled performance that seemed to have deserted them on recent Continental excursions. </p> <p>The Austrian champions had not lost in Graz in a European match since United plundered a 3-0 win here 15 months ago, while Ferguson's team arrived in Styria without a win on the Continent since beating Bordeaux in March. It was a sequence, Ferguson privately conceded, that was threatening to sap morale. </p> <p>United's foreign problems had long perplexed the United manager but now, with last year's runners-up Valencia drawing 0-0 at Panathinaikos last night, his side will resume European duties in February as the overwhelming favourites to progress. </p> <p>Realistically, they need only four points from their remaining four games to book a place in the last eight and, as Ferguson was at pains to emphasise, their chances will be enhanced by the return from injury of Jaap Stam and Andy Cole. </p> <p>\"We've got a 100% record going into the two-month break and when we come back I think our double-header against Valencia will have a bearing on who wins the group,\" said Ferguson. \"This was a good win for us but the result in Greece was exactly what we wanted, too. I'm more than satisfied.\" </p> <p>Graz have reserved their best performances for the Champions League this season, but United soon assumed an air of authority and their first serious attack on 17 minutes saw an opening goal that was exquisite in its creation and clinical in its execution. </p> <p>Dwight Yorke started the move with an incisive pass to the fringe of the Graz penalty area but it was Teddy Sheringham's sublime flick back that did the damage. Scholes timed his run to perfection before expertly lifting the ball over the oncoming goalkeeper Kaz imierz Sidorczuk for United's first goal in open play on the Continent for seven hours and 53 minutes. </p> <p>That took Scholes level with Denis Law, at least in the European Cup, with 14 goals, three behind Cole. \"It was a wonderful goal,\" eulogised Ferguson. \"Paul has always been a good finisher since he was a kid and it's incredible how many he scores from midfield.\" </p> <p>Graz seemed to be engulfed by an inferiority complex for the rest of an opening half in which Fabien Barthez had to make only one save, diving to his right to keep out Ivica Vastic's 25-yard free-kick. </p> <p>The second half was not so comfortable, with Tomica Kocijan hitting the United crossbar with a rasping drive and only the brilliance of Barthez sparing what would have been a spectacular headed own-goal by Roy Keane. </p> <p>But as the temperature dropped so did the heads of the Graz players and, after Sheringham had had a goal ruled out for offside, much to the irritation of Ferguson, Giggs sealed victory with an emphatic left-foot drive beneath Sidorczuk's body eight minutes after replacing Nicky Butt. Mission accomplished. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Milan and Galatasaray went joint top of Group B after 1-0 victories last night,</strong> the Italians winning at the Spanish league leaders Deportivo La Coruna when the Denmark midfielder Thomas Helveg struck from 20 yards out in first-half injury-time.

      "bodyText": "For all their omnipotence in the Premiership and the carefree abandon with which they are strutting towards their seventh title in nine years, Manchester United have waited a long time for this moment. Unspectacular yet effective, Sir Alex Ferguson's team rediscovered the winning formula in Europe here last night, bolstering their challenge for a fifth successive Champions League quarter-final with their first victory on foreign soil for nine months. They are now two points clear in Group A courtesy of a goal in each half from Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs - in the type of controlled performance that seemed to have deserted them on recent Continental excursions. The Austrian champions had not lost in Graz in a European match since United plundered a 3-0 win here 15 months ago, while Ferguson's team arrived in Styria without a win on the Continent since beating Bordeaux in March. It was a sequence, Ferguson privately conceded, that was threatening to sap morale. United's foreign problems had long perplexed the United manager but now, with last year's runners-up Valencia drawing 0-0 at Panathinaikos last night, his side will resume European duties in February as the overwhelming favourites to progress. Realistically, they need only four points from their remaining four games to book a place in the last eight and, as Ferguson was at pains to emphasise, their chances will be enhanced by the return from injury of Jaap Stam and Andy Cole. \"We've got a 100% record going into the two-month break and when we come back I think our double-header against Valencia will have a bearing on who wins the group,\" said Ferguson. \"This was a good win for us but the result in Greece was exactly what we wanted, too. I'm more than satisfied.\" Graz have reserved their best performances for the Champions League this season, but United soon assumed an air of authority and their first serious attack on 17 minutes saw an opening goal that was exquisite in its creation and clinical in its execution. Dwight Yorke started the move with an incisive pass to the fringe of the Graz penalty area but it was Teddy Sheringham's sublime flick back that did the damage. Scholes timed his run to perfection before expertly lifting the ball over the oncoming goalkeeper Kaz imierz Sidorczuk for United's first goal in open play on the Continent for seven hours and 53 minutes. That took Scholes level with Denis Law, at least in the European Cup, with 14 goals, three behind Cole. \"It was a wonderful goal,\" eulogised Ferguson. \"Paul has always been a good finisher since he was a kid and it's incredible how many he scores from midfield.\" Graz seemed to be engulfed by an inferiority complex for the rest of an opening half in which Fabien Barthez had to make only one save, diving to his right to keep out Ivica Vastic's 25-yard free-kick. The second half was not so comfortable, with Tomica Kocijan hitting the United crossbar with a rasping drive and only the brilliance of Barthez sparing what would have been a spectacular headed own-goal by Roy Keane. But as the temperature dropped so did the heads of the Graz players and, after Sheringham had had a goal ruled out for offside, much to the irritation of Ferguson, Giggs sealed victory with an emphatic left-foot drive beneath Sidorczuk's body eight minutes after replacing Nicky Butt. Mission accomplished. \u0095 Milan and Galatasaray went joint top of Group B after 1-0 victories last night, the Italians winning at the Spanish league leaders Deportivo La Coruna when the Denmark midfielder Thomas Helveg struck from 20 yards out in first-half injury-time. In Istanbul, Galatasaray beat Paris St-Germain thanks to Umit Davala's 51st-minute penalty, which means PSG have now gone nine matches without a win - and without the injured Nicolas Anelka as a starter. Sturm Graz (3-5-1-1): Sidorczuk; Prilasnig, Popovic, Neukirchner (Strafner, 81min); Schopp, Fleurquin, Mamedov (Mahlich, 85), Korsos (Reinmayr, 70), Minavand; Vastic; Kocijan. Manchester United (4-4-2): Barthez; Irwin (P Neville, 89), Brown, G Neville, Silvestre; Beckham, Butt (Giggs, 80), Keane, Scholes; Sheringham, Yorke (Solskjaer, 89). Referee: A Frisk (Sweden).",

The text message boom is showing no sign of ending since the first short message service (SMS) signal was sent in 1992. The monthly figures are increasing 1,000% year-on-year, bringing a considerable boost to the coffers of mobile phone companies. Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company, earns 5% of its revenue from SMS services. Teenage use of text message has boosted traffic for all phone companies, many of which are now advertising the \"hip\" aspect of text messaging instead of straight-forward phone conversations. Text messaging is also being pioneered in shopping centres as a means of relaying news about in-store promotions and discounts. The IDC survey added that about 8.6bn messages will be sent in the UK this year, which translates to around 24m each day. A further survey by internet giant AOL showed that one in five teenagers aged between 13 and 16 only use their phone for text messages. The soaring figures for SMS products will boost companies' hopes that data services will become a big money-spinner for mobile phones in the future.",

      "bodyText": "Forty of the world's leading players, including the world champion Mark Williams, Ronnie 0'Sullivan and Stephen Hendry, are to support a 10-tournament tour to rival the existing world-ranking events. A new internet company, The Sportsmasters Network (TSN), is behind the plan which will spark the biggest shake-up in the 75-year history of professional snooker and directly challenges the authority of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association which has governed the game since 1971. The move means that next spring's Embassy world championship in Sheffield will be the last in which all the leading players will compete. That will be greeted with dismay by the BBC, which has recently signed a six-year deal reported to be worth \u00a323m. Snooker's dependence on tobacco companies for sponsorship has been a key element in the TSN decision to go it alone. George Smith, TSN's chief executive, said: \"Over the last decade, snooker has found it impossible to attract new sponsors who are concerned that their own brands would suffer from indirect association with tobacco, while legislation has also severely limited broadcast opportunities. \"For all these reasons, TSN will be working to attract a new range of global sponsors to the sport, also pre-empting the legislation for a complete ban on tobacco sponsorship scheduled for 2003.\" Tobacco sponsorship covers three of the current eight world-ranking events, and Benson and Hedges sponsor the game's most prestigious invitation event, the Masters at Wembley. Four of next season's world-ranking events have no sponsor. Links with tobacco are not the only reason why WPBSA has failed to attract backers. The business and sponsorship worlds have become increasingly reluctant to deal with an organisation perceived to lack commercial experience. TSN, which received a \u00a310m investment from the City finance house Warburg Pincus last May, spent last summer on the brink of a three-year deal which would have given the governing body \u00a33.3m in exchange for the title sponsorships of four events: the Champions Cup (ITV), British Open (Sky), Grand Prix (BBC) and Nations Cup (ITV). In addition, TSN would have become WPBSA's internet partners, bearing the costs of that operation but giving the association 45% of any profit. Having already concluded a 10-year \u00a36m deal with the International Billiards and Snooker Federation, which has 60 national associations affiliated to it, TSN has simply decided to go head-to-head with the governing body. TSN's five-man board is chaired by Ian Doyle,who manages Williams, Hendry, O'Sullivan and 20 others. The key to the deal is the internet product. TSN's information website is attracting 3.5m hits per month from 110 countries. But to make any real money, not immediately but a couple of years down the road, it needs moving pictures of important tournaments. For October's Regal Scottish Masters, the only event Doyle promotes, TSN obtained permission from BBC Scotland TV to show its pictures live on the internet. This was supported by TSN's own studio coverage. The response was immense from established snooker nations, particularly China when Marco Fu made his 147, and unexpectedly positive from Brunei, Mongolia, Nepal, Lebanon, Uruguay, Saudi Arabia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Tonga, hitherto unconsidered as hotbeds of snooker.",

Emap's relegation from the flagship FTSE 100 index has intensified rumours within the company that talks are under way with Reed Elsevier or Wilmington about a possible sale. Analysts believe the sale of the division would be worth \u00a3750m. Emap would use the cash to strengthen its presence abroad and boost its consumer publishing arm, as the company's plunging stock has ruled out the use of shares as an acquisition currency. The publishing and broadcast company was kicked out of the FTSE after seeing its share price crash from a year-high of nearly 1800p to last night's 774p. A debt mountain of \u00a3650m, combined with demotion from the FTSE, will make fund-raising difficult in an already fractious market. Emap's most recent results showed a dip in advertising growth and flat profits, although revenues at the communications division rose 8%.

Ministers expect this first private finance initiative in primary health care to generate \u00a31bn to renovate up to 3,000 of England's 10,000 family doctor premises by 2004. They hope to attract a bank or pension fund as a partner. Long-term returns would come from rents from GPs, pharmacists, opticians and non-medical commercial outlets that would be clustered in newly-built or modernised high street premises. The government expects the scheme to be less controversial than other recent private partnerships because GPs already lease premises from private landlords, often in unsatisfactory buildings with upkeep problems. The scheme will be run by an \"equity stake company\" to be called the NHS Local Improvement Finance Trust (NHS Lift). Over the next four years it will get \u00a3175m from the Department of Health, \u00a3175m from the Treasury's equity stake initiative Partnership UK, and a similar amount from a commercial partner. The equity fund will be used to support borrowing from other financial institutions to raise \u00a31 bn over four years. A Department of Health spokesman said the company's priority would be to invest in parts of the country, such as inner cities, where primary care services were most in need of expansion. The initiative would assist regeneration and relieve GPs from the commercial risk of developing premises in the run-down areas where they were most needed. Leases would be made available to GPs whether they were salaried, independent or working in partnerships. The terms would make it easier for a GP to move after a few years and pass the practice to a successor. The British Medical Association said it could not tell whether the scheme would work until the government gave more details. \"Nonetheless, the intention to improve GP premises, particularly in inner cities, is clearly one we would support,\" said John Chisholm, chairman of the association's general practitioners committee.

The bill will also: \u0095 Give more prescribing rights to nurses, chiropodists, physiotherapists and pharmacists. \u0095 Encourage health authorities and local councils to integrate NHS and social services by merging their powers under \"care trusts\" - with a reserve power for ministers to require this. \u0095 Make the NHS responsible for paying for nursing care in homes for older people, but not personal care as a royal commission recommended. A second health bill will ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco. Ministers wanted this to be done through an EU directive, but that was struck down by the European court. Gordon McVie, director general of the Cancer Research Campaign, said the legislation was \"the beginning of the end for the tobacco industry in Britain\". He congratulated the government on ignoring \"the persistent bleatings of the tobacco manufacturers, who even now refuse to accept responsibility for the needless deaths of millions of people worldwide\". Yvette Cooper, the public health minister, said the advertising ban would save up to 3,000 lives a year. The brands most heavily advertised were those most heavily smoked by children, she said.",

      "body": "<p>There is a remarkably close similarity between Labour's Queen's speech yesterday and John Major's last legislative programme in 1996-7. Both programmes were designed as a shameless, populist appeal to the swing voters in marginal seats.</p> <p>For the single-minded focus of those who assemble a government's final legislative programme is middle England, and their enemies - drunks, drug pushers, benefit fraudsters, car thieves, kerb crawlers, teenage yobs, and liberal judges.</p> <p>Thus, in the autumn of 1996 Mr Major published no less than five law and order bills, beating Mr Straw's current four. Michael Howard, the then home secretary, described his programme \"as the most radical attack on crime this century\", highlighting plans to impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted more than once for drug trafficking or burglary. Like Labour yesterday, Mr Major also added a social security fraud bill and introduced measures to give councils powers to confiscate alcohol being consumed by anyone under-18 in public places, a theme to which Mr Straw has returned with his anti-yobs package.</p> <p>The Conservatives' hope in 1996 was that Tony Blair's \"tough on crime\" message could be punctured by manoeuvring Labour into opposing sentencing measures that had outraged the judiciary. Mr Blair saw a political trap and declined to oppose any of it. It was left to the appeal court judge Lord Bridge to fulminate against \"the Satanic pact between the two main political parties to see that this ill-considered legislation is forced through\".</p> <p>Mr Blair even urged Mr Howard to introduce extra measures to hit paedophiles and stalkers. Fearing he was being outbid in an anti-crime auction, Mr Howard hastily tabled the measures.</p> <p>Four years later, Mr Blair has now returned to the same auction with his own package. The message was supplemented last night with an anti-crime TV political broadcast advertising the Crimestoppers number.</p> <p>Mr Blair has been prompted by a stream of eloquent messages from his pollster, Philip Gould, in the spring that William Hague was gaining ground on crime. Fear of crime is on the rise.</p> <p>Labour strategists also concede that the overall drop in police numbers in this parliament could be its achilles heel in the election. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, certainly intends to cite the figures in every TV studio in the country right through the election campaign. As to the bills themselves, Miss Widdecombe will not oppose them - just dismiss them.</p> <p>Labour clearly hopes that the headline measures, such as fixed penalty fines and extended curfews, will reassure its doubters. Most Labour MPs yesterday swallowed the anti-crime gimmickry as a necessary evil. But they fear overall that the speech looks too thin and too obviously constructed with a spring election in mind. The relative thinness is, in part, because Labour struggled with its previous legislative programme, due to its lack of overall majority in the Lords.</p> <p>Again a comparison with the 1997 election run-in is instructive. In the run-up to the May 1997 election, the house started meeting from October 23 to March 21 with 86 sitting days over 718 hours. The late start to this session, the latest for decades, leaves only 14 weeks before Mr Blair will fire the election starting pistol.</p> <p>But Labour strategists insist there is enough to keep the New Labour coalition together.

      "bodyText": "There is a remarkably close similarity between Labour's Queen's speech yesterday and John Major's last legislative programme in 1996-7. Both programmes were designed as a shameless, populist appeal to the swing voters in marginal seats. For the single-minded focus of those who assemble a government's final legislative programme is middle England, and their enemies - drunks, drug pushers, benefit fraudsters, car thieves, kerb crawlers, teenage yobs, and liberal judges. Thus, in the autumn of 1996 Mr Major published no less than five law and order bills, beating Mr Straw's current four. Michael Howard, the then home secretary, described his programme \"as the most radical attack on crime this century\", highlighting plans to impose mandatory minimum sentences on people convicted more than once for drug trafficking or burglary. Like Labour yesterday, Mr Major also added a social security fraud bill and introduced measures to give councils powers to confiscate alcohol being consumed by anyone under-18 in public places, a theme to which Mr Straw has returned with his anti-yobs package. The Conservatives' hope in 1996 was that Tony Blair's \"tough on crime\" message could be punctured by manoeuvring Labour into opposing sentencing measures that had outraged the judiciary. Mr Blair saw a political trap and declined to oppose any of it. It was left to the appeal court judge Lord Bridge to fulminate against \"the Satanic pact between the two main political parties to see that this ill-considered legislation is forced through\". Mr Blair even urged Mr Howard to introduce extra measures to hit paedophiles and stalkers. Fearing he was being outbid in an anti-crime auction, Mr Howard hastily tabled the measures. Four years later, Mr Blair has now returned to the same auction with his own package. The message was supplemented last night with an anti-crime TV political broadcast advertising the Crimestoppers number. Mr Blair has been prompted by a stream of eloquent messages from his pollster, Philip Gould, in the spring that William Hague was gaining ground on crime. Fear of crime is on the rise. Labour strategists also concede that the overall drop in police numbers in this parliament could be its achilles heel in the election. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, certainly intends to cite the figures in every TV studio in the country right through the election campaign. As to the bills themselves, Miss Widdecombe will not oppose them - just dismiss them. Labour clearly hopes that the headline measures, such as fixed penalty fines and extended curfews, will reassure its doubters. Most Labour MPs yesterday swallowed the anti-crime gimmickry as a necessary evil. But they fear overall that the speech looks too thin and too obviously constructed with a spring election in mind. The relative thinness is, in part, because Labour struggled with its previous legislative programme, due to its lack of overall majority in the Lords. Again a comparison with the 1997 election run-in is instructive. In the run-up to the May 1997 election, the house started meeting from October 23 to March 21 with 86 sitting days over 718 hours. The late start to this session, the latest for decades, leaves only 14 weeks before Mr Blair will fire the election starting pistol. But Labour strategists insist there is enough to keep the New Labour coalition together. There is a nod to Labour activists through the fox hunting measure, even if Mr Straw does not expect the bill reaches the statute book. Human rights activists may be mollified by jam tomorrow on arms exports. The laws needed to impose the NHS plan may be obscure, but they are a sign of intent, along with the shedloads of cash for the NHS in the summer spending review. And in the end it will be the economy and the state of public services which will determine this election. Bills in brief Education Children with disabilities and special educational needs will have greater rights to be educated in mainstream schools under the terms of a bill unveiled in the Queen's speech. Schools, colleges, universities and local authorities in England and Wales would have to ensure they do not treat disabled pupils less favourably than non-disabled children. Northern Ireland A radical overhaul of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland is planned in the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland (Draft) Bill, which seeks to put in place a raft of recommendations of a review group set up under the Good Friday agreement. The draft bill, which will be published in April 2001, will seek to implement the review's conclusions - which range from banning the practice of saying: \"God save the Queen\" when a judge enters a court, to setting up a commission for the appointment of judges, to ending the RUC's role in prosecuting 30,000 minor offences each year. Armed forces Military law will be updated to bring it in line with civilian law in the armed forces bill, which is introduced every five years to iron out anomalies. Procedures for investigating offences committed by service personnel will be altered, to bring them in line with the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Child protection The powers of the children's commissioner in Wales - a post introduced this year in the wake of the Waterhouse report - will be greatly extended ensuring the as-yet-unappointed commissioner can review and monitor arrangements for complaints and advocacy on behalf of children in schools and NHS hospitals, not just those in the care of local authorities.

British service chiefs drove home the point yesterday, say ing there would be no separate European command structure. They no longer describe the proposed body of up to 60,000 troops to carry out joint peacekeeping and humanitarian operations as a \"rapid reaction force\", let alone a \"standing European army\", but talk of \"a pool of national forces\". Nato officials say that French obstruction is blocking a key agreement on how the EU and Nato would cooperate on military matters. \"How will Nato speak to the EU?\" a Nato source said. \"We need permanent arrangements to lock Nato in.\" Britain and France are acting from very different motives. An influential body of French opinion wants an autonomous EU military role, as distant from Nato as possible. To Britain, military affairs is one area of EU activity in which it has the capacity to lead. A further consideration was expressed by a senior UK military commander. \"The Americans are going to do less, and if Europe does not do more, [they] are going to do much less. Can we blame them?\"",

      "bodyText": "The African National Congress has been stung by a significant drop in support, which cost it control of one of South Africa's most important cities in yesterday's municipal elections. Backing for the main opposition party surged in some parts of the country. The ANC took four of the six new \"megacities\", which bring the old white cities and their surrounding black townships into single administrations. But it lost Cape Town, after failing in a vigorous attempt to win over the mixed-race or \"coloured\" vote. It was also unable to secure an outright majority in Durban, despite a collapse in support for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. With most of the votes counted, the ANC had taken about 60% of the popular vote, down 7% on last year's national elections. The drop in support was significantly more marked in cities such as Johannesburg. The main beneficiary was the Democratic Alliance, which increased by more than 6% the combined totals of the Democratic and National parties, which merged to form the alliance earlier this year. \"These elections signal a very significant victory for the DA, in particular in some of the metropolitan areas where it increased the percentage of its vote by as much as 20%,\" David Pottie of the Electoral Institute in Johannesburg said. \"They will certainly hail this as a vindication of their campaign effort as well as maintaining the momentum of building an effective opposition. They've been very tenacious in building themselves up in the minds of voters as the official opposition, even though that concept does not really exist in a proportional representation system.\" The alliance's rise is all the more significant given that, as the former Democratic party, it picked up just 2% of the vote in South Africa's first free elections in 1994. Now it commands more than a quarter of the ballot. In part this is because in absorbing the old National party, which gave South Africa the nightmare of full-blown apartheid, it acquired many Afrikaner and \"coloured\" votes. But although it is technically a joint venture, no one is in any doubt that the Democratic party element of the coalition is dominant and driving the surge in support. The alliance has also built on the collapse of support for the Inkatha Freedom party in its former stronghold KwaZulu-Natal, where it lost about a quarter of its vote compared with last year's ballot. The alliance took the bulk of Inkatha's loss, the rest going to the ANC. But while the elections entrench the alliance as the real opposition to President Thabo Mbeki's government, the party has little prospect of gaining power nationally without a big increase in support from black people. Because the breakdown of the vote will not be available until today, it is not immediately clear whether the alliance picked up many black votes from the ANC - which would prepare the ground for it to become a broad church rather than the voice of disaffected minorities - or the fall in ANC support reflected a failure to vote rather than a shift in the voting pattern. Fewer than half the potential voters bothered to cast their ballot. The ANC attributed that to apathy, but Mr Pottie is sceptical. \"I think that they should be worried by voter turnout,\" he said. \"What is so worrying is that so much effort has been put into trumpeting the allure of strong local government that it is possible to connect the low voter turnout to dissatisfaction with the way things are being run.\"",

Since the clashes with the Palestinians broke out more than nine weeks ago, the boycott campaign has become stronger than ever.</p> <p>Even the state-run television has recently allowed opposition figures to call openly for boycotts of US and Israeli products, disregarding the fact that Egypt has been a key ally of Washington in the region since the late 1970s.</p> <p>The latest influential figure to join the boycott call was the Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Nasser Farid Wassel, the country's highest Islamic religious authority. He was quoted by local newspapers as saying that buying US and Israeli products at this stage was haram (forbidden) because of the killing of Palestinians.</p> <p>Meanwhile, warnings by local businessmen that thousands of Egyptians would lose their jobs if companies like Sainsbury's closed have fallen on deaf ears.</p> <p>Mustafa Bakri, the editor of a local opposition weekly and an Arab nationalist, said: \"These warnings should not scare us or discourage us from continuing our campaign.

Now, Sainsbury's says it may pull out of Egypt altogether, though no final decision has been announced. A spokeswoman said yesterday that its Egyptian arm generated sales of \u00a340.5m and an operating loss of \u00a310.2m in the first half of this year. \"Losses were higher than expected as a result of delayed store openings due to local licensing difficulties and, more recently, through a deterioration of the trading environment in the Middle East,\" the spokeswoman said. Since 1979 - when Egypt became the first Arab country to sign a peace agreement with Israel - opponents of the deal, mainly leftwingers and political Islamic groups, have been leading a campaign to boycott Israeli products and institutions. Since the clashes with the Palestinians broke out more than nine weeks ago, the boycott campaign has become stronger than ever. Even the state-run television has recently allowed opposition figures to call openly for boycotts of US and Israeli products, disregarding the fact that Egypt has been a key ally of Washington in the region since the late 1970s. The latest influential figure to join the boycott call was the Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Nasser Farid Wassel, the country's highest Islamic religious authority. He was quoted by local newspapers as saying that buying US and Israeli products at this stage was haram (forbidden) because of the killing of Palestinians. Meanwhile, warnings by local businessmen that thousands of Egyptians would lose their jobs if companies like Sainsbury's closed have fallen on deaf ears. Mustafa Bakri, the editor of a local opposition weekly and an Arab nationalist, said: \"These warnings should not scare us or discourage us from continuing our campaign. Many businessmen support us, and if a few hundred workers were fired, they should be able to offer them jobs.\"",

      "bodyText": "In an attempt to get to grips with the flagging popularity of sumo, the governing body of Japan's national sport has announced a new set of winning moves for the first time in 40 years. Currently, wrestlers have a choice of 70 ways of throwing, pushing, tripping or slapping their opponents on to the floor or out of the elevated clay ring for a victory. But under the new rules the behemoths will be allowed to use 12 new techniques including the tokkuri-nage - gripping an opponent's head or neck in both hands and twisting him down to the ground - and the ushiro-motage , in which the opponent is spun round and lifted out of the ring like a giant bag of rice. The Japan sumo association says the change reflects the new styles of wrestlers who are faster and more powerful than their predecessors who were in the ring when the rules were last altered in 1960. Many observers, however, say the change is also aimed at reviving a sport that has lost a lot of its sheen, both inside and outside the ring. \"Too many bouts in recent times have concluded in a very uninteresting fashion with the bigger guy merely pushing his opponent out,\" said Gen Iida, a sumo reporter for the Nikkan Sports News.

But alongside the cosy rhetoric of \"bipartisan\" politics, he and his fellow Republican leaders are pressing ahead with a drive to force their conservative agenda through a divided political system. Mr Bush campaigned as \"a uniter not a divider\", and the election results on November 7 - in which not just the presidency but also both houses of the US Congress ended finely balanced -have increased the pressure on all American politicians to talk of the need for cooperation \"across the aisle\". In an interview with CBS television on Tuesday night, Mr Bush again struck a conciliatory note in tune with the current mood. \"We're all Americans,\" he said. \"There's a unique opportunity to say to the country and to future generations, we proved the sceptics wrong, that we can work together, that there is a spirit of coopartion, that it's possible to have a spirit of cooperation in Washington DC.\" But remarks like this are strongly at odds with the private mood among Republican members of the two houses of Congress. Republicans control the House of Representatives 221-212, and their potential vice-president, Dick Cheney, would have the casting vote in the Senate, which is divided 50-50. And with Mr Bush in the White House, many Republicans are determined to make the most of their opportunity, whatever the Democrats may say. \"Someone's got to be in the majority,\" Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a conservative, said yesterday. \"Someone's got to set the agenda. I've been waiting all my life to have a Republican president and a Republican Congress.\" Mr Bush's actions in the past week underline this aim. Last weekend he spoke on the telephone to Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, about the possibility of a job in his administration. The conversation was portrayed by the Bush camp as proof of their man's willingness to reach out to conservative \"Blue Dog\" Democrats. But there is an important subtext to any attempt to recruit Mr Breaux. If he took a government job he would lose his seat, and the Louisiana governor Mike Foster, a Republican, would then be able to nominate a successor. That would swing the Senate 51-49 to the Republicans, taking some of the pressure off Mr Cheney. There was little or no evidence this week of any new spirit of cooperation by either party in the Senate. Democrats have lost little time in proposing a \"power-sharing arrangement\" in which the two parties have equal budgets, equal representation on committees, and a division of committee chairmanships. \"We will not be satisfied with anything less than a 50-50 split in the responsibilities and opportunities,\" the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, said. But Republicans quickly dismissed the proposal. \"We've got to deal with the realm of possibility, not fondest dream,\" the Republican leader, Senator Trent Lott, responded. \"Somebody has to be in charge, and we will be very clear about what we will do here.\" \"Because we have such a small margin of control, I don't want to give away what little power we have,\" said Senator Don Nickles, another key Republican. Though Mr Lott has lost a number of important senate allies as a result of the elections, his conservative wing managed to retain control of the Republican senate caucus this week. An ally of Mr Lott, Larry Craig, held on to the policy committee chairmanship in a 26-24 split with Pete Domenici, who was supported by the moderates. Another conservative senator, Rick Santorum, defeated the more moderate Kit Bond for the vacant chairmanship of the Republican Senate conference. Republican conservatives are even more firmly entrenched in the House of Representatives, where the Speaker, Dennis Hastert, a pragmatic conservative, rules in alliance with the implacably partisan Republican whip, Congressman Tom DeLay. Mr DeLay, another Texan, is widely predicted to be the key Republican legislative leader in a Bush administration. He made his intentions clear this week by refusing to support a compromise with the Clinton administration over outstanding federal budget spending bills, which have still not been agreed, even though the US fiscal year is more than two months old.

      "body": "<p>Before beginning, a quick review of the performance of those stocks promoted to the FTSE 100 yesterday. </p> <p> <strong> Rolls-Royce</strong> fell 17p to 197p, <strong> AB Foods</strong> lost 16p to 481.25p, <strong> Safeway</strong> shed 12p to 306p, <strong> Smiths Group</strong> was off 4p at 815p, while <strong> Autonomy</strong> rose 314p to \u00a331. </p> <p>Further proof that stocks promoted to blue-chip index tend to underperform and stocks demoted tend to outperform. A point further illustrated by the performance of optical components maker <strong> Bookham</strong> - up 230p, or 21.5%, at \u00a313. </p> <p>In the case of Bookham, there are probably other factors at work. First, there was what dealers were calling the Nokia effect - a reference to Tuesday's prediction by the Finnish handset company that there will could 1bn mobile phone subscribers by the first half of 2002. </p> <p>Then, there was some speculative froth. Early in the session there were reports that Bookham's chief executive, Andrew Rickman, had been spotted entering the Fleet Street offices of Goldman Sachs - the company's financial adviser. Had Mr Rickman popped into for a bit advice on that takeover approach from its biggest customer <strong> Nortel</strong>, brokers asked themselves? </p> <p>Well, it seemed a bit far fetched and as the morning wore on it became clear that it was. Mr Rickman was indeed visiting a Sachs but not a Goldman.

      "bodyText": "Before beginning, a quick review of the performance of those stocks promoted to the FTSE 100 yesterday. Rolls-Royce fell 17p to 197p, AB Foods lost 16p to 481.25p, Safeway shed 12p to 306p, Smiths Group was off 4p at 815p, while Autonomy rose 314p to \u00a331. Further proof that stocks promoted to blue-chip index tend to underperform and stocks demoted tend to outperform. A point further illustrated by the performance of optical components maker Bookham - up 230p, or 21.5%, at \u00a313. In the case of Bookham, there are probably other factors at work. First, there was what dealers were calling the Nokia effect - a reference to Tuesday's prediction by the Finnish handset company that there will could 1bn mobile phone subscribers by the first half of 2002. Then, there was some speculative froth. Early in the session there were reports that Bookham's chief executive, Andrew Rickman, had been spotted entering the Fleet Street offices of Goldman Sachs - the company's financial adviser. Had Mr Rickman popped into for a bit advice on that takeover approach from its biggest customer Nortel, brokers asked themselves? Well, it seemed a bit far fetched and as the morning wore on it became clear that it was. Mr Rickman was indeed visiting a Sachs but not a Goldman. He was in fact with Sachs Associates, who were hosting a major international investor conference over at the Le Meridien Grosvenor Hotel in the West End. Whatever was being said at the bash - which had the catchy title of the Second European Forum For Emerging Growth Technology Companies, and cost \u00a3410 for entry - was obviously worth listening to.

Over in the banking sector, the conspiracy theorists were working overtime on the Abbey National, down 33p to \u00a311.23, Bank of Scotland, unchanged at 690, Lloyds TSB, off 15p to 627, takeover saga.

B'Tselem, which is calling for a commission of inquiry into the violence, claims that Israel has not adopted a policy of restraint in the occupied territories. The 40-page report, which includes interviews with serving soldiers, concludes that the rules on when soldiers are permitted to open fire are inconsistent. \"We could not get a clear understanding as to why over one quarter of the deaths, caused by Israeli soldiers were Palestinian children under the age of 17,\" the report's author, Yael Stein, said. Almost 300 people have been killed, most of them Palestinians, in 10 weeks of violence. A soldier on reserve duty told B'Tselem: \"The original open-fire regulations that we received were that, if someone throws stones or a Molotov cocktail at you, but does not threaten you, don't fire. \"After the lynching [of 2 Israeli soldiers], the orders were changed and they said that, if a soldier feels in danger from the throwing of stones or Molotov cocktails, he is authorised to fire at the legs, even without consulting with the commander. \"I asked the soldiers with me and they understood that, in effect, they were allowing us - with a wink - to fire wherever we want.\" A sniper doing compulsory service in the army said: \"The term 'actual threat' changes from sector to sector and from period to period. \"If, for example, the sector was calm for a few days, then we try not to kill so as not to heat up the sector.\" B'Tselem's report criticised the army for failing to develop non-lethal methods of dispersing demonstrations. \"As a result, soldiers only had at their disposal rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition, which caused many Palestinian casualties and many injuries to medical teams and journalists,\" it said.",

And just as religious faith defies the light of reason, so we are reluctant to examine the monarchy with anything more than an irritated shrug: well, who would you want as head of state, Paddy Ashdown?

With the death of Diana we saw an outpouring of passion that wasn't just the apotheosis of the Hello! syndrome nor was it the mourning for a fallen demi-goddess dying in the under(pass)world. For the thousands of people who threw flowers on the hearse, who streamed towards the shrines at Kensington and Buckingham palaces in the early morning, who bore banners such as \"Diana of love\", \"When Irish eyes are crying\" and \"Diana, fairy godmother of the needy Colombians in mourning\", it was some thing more: it was religious ecstasy. Some people described it as a revolt against the monarchy, but it wasn't: the new religion replaced the old, it was evolution not revolution.</p> <p>When the heat of religious passion died down, we slipped back into our habitually tepid faith, curated by a priesthood of civil servants, constitutional historians, politicians, public figures and broadcasters who agonise about ritual, protocol and precedent and live in fear of lese majest\u00e9, while the blessing, the royal \"appellation\", is invoked on all our public institutions, our lifeboat service, ambulances, hospitals, academies, charities, concert halls, and theatres, in order that they can serve as the rivets of our theocratic state.

MSN (Microsoft Network), which hosted the concert, says the webcast easily eclipsed Paul McCartney's concert from Liverpool's Cavern Club last year, which attracted three million viewers. Madonna's concert might have lasted only 29 minutes and contained some six songs (five of them off her new album), but it generated as much fuss as the Nasdaq crash. </p> <p>It all started about four months ago when Madonna first approached MSN with the idea of producing a small webcast to promote her new album, Music. Initially the plan was to do two or three songs on a small stage using no more than three of four cameras - something akin to McCartney's Cavern gig. But MSN realised it could be the biggest event so far on the internet. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.MSN.co.uk\">MSN.co.uk</a>, the UK arm of the Microsoft Network, hosted the event. MSN claims that no money changed hands for the gig, despite rumours that both Apple and AOL offered Madonna \u00a32m for the rights to the concert. One week after the event, official figures are still to be released, but MSN says it is expecting nearly 20 million visits by the time the site is taken down. </p> <p>The event was produced by Done and Dusted, a two-year-old company that specialises in televising large concerts and festivals. The Madonna gig is by far the biggest audience it has attempted to reach. Done and Dusted arrived in Brixton four days before to prepare for the 2 3/4 hour show. Done and Dusted employed a crew of 120, including 20 camera operators and 25 sound technicians - roughly the same as for a Robbie Williams gig it produced in Slaine Castle in Dublin. Although that time the audience pushed 100,000 - more than 30 times the number who were at the Academy last Tuesday night. </p> <p>Paul Morrison, managing director of Done and Dusted, says: \"The majority of people will have watched the concert on a 56k modem at home. But what we have realised is that the audience for this medium is not my generation leaning back on the couch with a beer, but a younger generation leaning into their PCs saying 'engage with me'. </p> <p>\"In the past, people have been negative about web broadcasting because of the quality of the picture,\" explains Morrison. \"But the whole point is that it is not TV. Television comes in just one direction. The web is all about creating communities and opening up a two-way dialogue.\" </p> <p>MSN launched a huge scale promotional campaign to support the event. In its biggest ever net promotion for any artist, the gig was promoted to the 75 million users of MSN Hotmail in 17 languages and homepage promotions on more than 30 sites worldwide. </p> <p>Throughout the event the MSN sites worldwide stayed online and claim that they were more than able to handle the enormous amount of internet traffic. However, many users in the UK and abroad experienced delays and some were even shut out midway through the gig. MSN says that this was because of the sheer weight of demand coupled with pressure from local ISPs. And anyway, such is the nature of the webcasting beast. </p> <p>\"We streamed at very high bandwidths, and because the concert happened during the day in the US, which we didn't anticipate, this meant that a lot of people were still in the office and had access to high-speed connections,\" says Kathleen Flinn, MSN's website producer of the concert. \"Not that that is a bad thing, but we will have to take it into account in the future.\" </p> <p>Other users may also have experienced temporary delays - or buffering - as they queued to access the video and audio streams. This is because most dial-up connections cannot download the images fast enough. So the Media Player stores up screen information (or buffers) so that the picture remains constant. However, this can cause the screen to freeze for anything up to 30 seconds. </p> <p>But by the time Madonna went live shortly after 10pm, MSN claims it was able to re-route the majority of its troubled users to different servers around the world where demand was less intense - such as Australia where most of its users were asleep. </p> <p>\"No one has ever attempted anything on this scale before,\" says Tracy Blacher, marketing manager at MSN. \"We gave people the chance to see and hear Madonna's fantastic return to the stage and witness the first online live performance for free.\" </p> <p>The MSN website itself, the very hub of the night's events, was situated on the top deck of a double decker bus parked just outside the Academy. Here, a small team updated the website, tested the streams, and communicated with their partners around the world. And the concert was also seen on six massive screens in cities - including New York and Paris and at a special party in London's Brick Lane. </p> <p>Done and Dusted's future plans for webcasts include allowing users to select not only which camera angle to watch, but also to let them become virtual camera operators. The company will be filming The Corrs for Sky TV later this month and wants to offer the same interactive TV technology used for Premiership football. At next year's T in the Park in Glasgow, it plans to have cameras that people can direct themselves from their own PC. </p> <p>So after months of preparation, with a crew of 120, \u00a31m was spent on transforming Brixton Academy into a Wild West bonanza courtesy of Dolce and Gabbana, and a legion of stars to rival the best Oscar night party or the Douglas-Zeta Jones wedding turned out for the occasion. </p> <p>The connection to the internet was operated by Mediawave. It encoded the pictures provided by Done and Dusted into a digital format suitable for the Windows Media Player needed to view the concert. And also - crucially - uploading the footage to the internet backbone via ISDN and satellite. </p> <p>Oddly, the responsibility of reaching millions in 33 different countries boiled down to just three people in the back of a transit van.

At the same time the union denounced unpaid overtime, the lack of a wage scale, of an organisation chart and of information, criterias for recruitment, the multiplicity of short-term working periods and inequality between men and women. </p> <p>Lefebvre imagined a Ubi Soft employee creed: \"I am under 26.

      "body": "<p>'T he car is the next big platform in the evolution of the internet,\" says Ken Enders, the vice president of marketing at Mercedes Benz USA. He is looking forward to a world where ad hoc networks let you chat with or play games against people in other cars, in \"communities of like-minded commuters who happen to be stuck in the same traffic jam.\" And of course, when you drive by a supermarket, the car will tell you what you need. \"If your refrigerator knows you're out of milk, your car could know that too,\" he says. </p> <p>The internet is just one of the technologies being adapted for four wheels. Others include global positioning satellite (GPS) systems, vehicle tracking, mobile telephony, voice-activated controls, radar, and a wide range of entertainment systems from MP3 players to back-seat DVD movie theatres. </p> <p>People have stopped talking about \"in car computing\" - a hot topic a couple of years ago - and now refer to telematics, which covers everything from \"fly by wire\" steering systems to \"virtual companions\" such as <a href=\"http://www.mecel.se/autopc/html/mcmate.htm\">Mecel's McMate</a>, which will tell jokes and reel off DYKs (Did You Know...?). </p> <p>All this is starting to happen now. Pat Kerrigan, marketing manager of Intel's US-based in-car group, has been saying for years that \"it's not if but when? But it's not a question of when any more. Ford and General Motors will have telematics in all their cars by 2004-5, and by 2008 it will be in the rest of the world\", he says. </p> <p>In mainland Europe, you can already buy a Citroen fitted with an AutoPC. It looks like an audio CD player, is voice controlled, and can read out your SMS messages and email. </p> <p>In the UK and elsewhere you can buy a Jaguar with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): this lets the driver set the speed and distance from the car in front, so if someone pulls out in front of you, the car slows down all by itself. A similar radar-controlled system is fitted to some Mercedes-Benz cars, and the company already has a prototype that allows \"hands free\" autobahn driving. </p> <p>In the US, General Motors sells cars with the OnStar system, which puts a human operator on call, and is adding internet access to more than half its models. Ford and Qualcomm, a mobile phone company, are developing a rival service provisionally called Wingcast. If you lose your way in a car park, Wingcast will let you call the car on your mobile and honk the horn. And if the airbags inflate, Wingcast will assume you have been involved in an accident, call the emergency services, and tell them where you are. </p> <p>In Finland, tyre-maker Nokian Renkaat is developing \"smart tyres\" that use chips in each wheel to monitor pressure, temperature, wear and so on. If something goes wrong, they will be able to call the driver's Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone to report the problem. </p> <p>Last year when Ford unveiled its 24.7 concept car, which has an entirely \"soft\" (user-definable) dashboard, chief executive Jacques Nasser said: \"This is where the market is headed. It wasn't that we woke up one morning and said, 'Let's do this'. It's because that's where customers are headed.\" </p> <p>Facilities people have at home and in offices, they now want in their cars. </p> <p>Hardly anyone is promoting the idea of accessing websites on the move. \"It's not to do with using the internet per se,\" says Kerrigan, \"it's about the services you can render, whether it's information, or entertainment, or security and peace of mind.\" </p> <p>Jeremy Schwarz of US-based Forrester Research, who has just produced a report called Cars Get Wired, says safety is the number one concern for US consumers. The key services, he believes, are roadside assistance, stolen vehicle tracking, remote door unlocking, and emergency calls when airbags inflate. He expects the number of new cars fitted with security systems to grow from 800,000 today to a cumulative 30.4 million in 2005. </p> <p>The key entertainment features, says Schwarz, are computer games and movies on DVD for the family in the rear seats, plus internet and satellite radio and music downloads for everyone. He expects the number of cars fitted with these entertainment systems to grow from 200,000 today to a cumulative 28 million in 2005, with about half being supplied with new cars and half being fitted later. </p> <p>The number of cars with navigation systems will grow to 25.1 million by 2005, and the number with information systems to 16.1 million, with the majority being bought on the after-market in both cases. Schwarz says the key features include turn-by-turn navigation, real-time traffic rerouting, tourist information and location-based advertising, ticket reservations and restaurant bookings, email, news, share prices, weather reports, and diary functions. </p> <p>These features vary in their attractiveness. In an online survey, Forrester Research found that 52% of potential buyers were interested in navigation systems but only 9% in email. The most popular feature, at 58%, was a hands-free mobile phone. </p> <p>Ken Hale from Ford says hands-free telephony will be offered in the Ford Focus in the next 12 months, along with GPS navigation and a Traveller Assist service. </p> <p>Ken McConomy from Jaguar says voice activation is already available in the F type, \"so you can say 'phone home' or tell the radio 'volume up' or 'volume down'.\" Julian Leyton from Citroen was enthusiastic about the AutoPC fitted to a Xsara prototype that he drove for a month. \"With voice control you can adjust all the controls for the CD and radio, and it can read out your SMS messages. After a few days I was besotted with it.\" </p> <p>Leyton thinks this kind of thing is going to catch on, like central locking. \"Even if customers are not saying 'I must have this technology', once they've lived with it for a few weeks, they're not going to want to do without it.\" </p> <p>Safety features also have good sales prospects. When Enders explains how Mercedes-Benz customers are trusting the company with their lives, and how seriously that trust is taken, you can easily forget he's also flogging you a very expensive car. Another advantage of this sales pitch is that the cost is inseparable from the price of the car: it is not an option. </p> <p>But less important services may be harder to sell, which may be unfortunate for the many companies hoping to make money out of them. </p> <p>The car manufacturers are attracted to the idea of information and entertainment services because they could provide a regular income. OnStar users, for example, pay from $200 to $400 a year. However, as Schwarz points out, content providers, wireless network providers and hardware vendors also want a slice of the pie. He thinks most consumers are unlikely to pay for much beyond basic navigation services, so the rest will have to be financed on a pay-per-use model or by advertising. </p> <p>The prospects for this depend on usage, which is vast in the US. America has 135 million registered vehicles - \"more cars and trucks than homes,\" says Enders - and people typically spend 90 minutes a day in their cars. Indeed, rather than trying to escape from their little tin boxes, Americans also use drive-in restaurants, banks and cinemas. If they won't buy in-car services, who will? </p> <p>There is another side to the story, which is that drivers may be exposing more of their lifestyles than they would like. The advantages of a sophisticated GPS-based information system could mean a reduction in traffic jams (because drivers will be routed away from them), and a better chance of finding a parking space (because cars can be directed only to areas where car parks have room for them). </p> <p> But it also allows a car's movements to be monitored, and will certainly make road charging schemes easier to implement. </p> <p>Smart cars that learn their driver's habits and preferences may also enable their driving habits to be analysed - and for the analysis to have a direct effect on their insurance premiums. </p> <p>And radar-based safety systems that prevent cars from running into one another could eventually take over most of the driving, though researchers on the Path (Partners for Advanced Transit and Highways) project at the University of California at Berkeley suggest that is still a decade away. </p> <p>The idea behind Path is to enable cars to talk to one another so that they can synchronise their movements. This will lead to more even speeds, a reduction in emissions, fewer traffic jams, and better use of existing roads.

The adaptive cruise control systems fitted to some Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz cars speed up and slow down without the driver's intervention, replacing for the first time the eye-to-foot reflex with a computer-based controller. </p> <p>Leyton says: \"The technology exists to run cars electronically locked together down the fast lane of the motorway.

      "bodyText": "'T he car is the next big platform in the evolution of the internet,\" says Ken Enders, the vice president of marketing at Mercedes Benz USA. He is looking forward to a world where ad hoc networks let you chat with or play games against people in other cars, in \"communities of like-minded commuters who happen to be stuck in the same traffic jam.\" And of course, when you drive by a supermarket, the car will tell you what you need. \"If your refrigerator knows you're out of milk, your car could know that too,\" he says. The internet is just one of the technologies being adapted for four wheels. Others include global positioning satellite (GPS) systems, vehicle tracking, mobile telephony, voice-activated controls, radar, and a wide range of entertainment systems from MP3 players to back-seat DVD movie theatres. People have stopped talking about \"in car computing\" - a hot topic a couple of years ago - and now refer to telematics, which covers everything from \"fly by wire\" steering systems to \"virtual companions\" such as Mecel's McMate, which will tell jokes and reel off DYKs (Did You Know...?). All this is starting to happen now. Pat Kerrigan, marketing manager of Intel's US-based in-car group, has been saying for years that \"it's not if but when? But it's not a question of when any more. Ford and General Motors will have telematics in all their cars by 2004-5, and by 2008 it will be in the rest of the world\", he says. In mainland Europe, you can already buy a Citroen fitted with an AutoPC. It looks like an audio CD player, is voice controlled, and can read out your SMS messages and email. In the UK and elsewhere you can buy a Jaguar with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): this lets the driver set the speed and distance from the car in front, so if someone pulls out in front of you, the car slows down all by itself. A similar radar-controlled system is fitted to some Mercedes-Benz cars, and the company already has a prototype that allows \"hands free\" autobahn driving. In the US, General Motors sells cars with the OnStar system, which puts a human operator on call, and is adding internet access to more than half its models. Ford and Qualcomm, a mobile phone company, are developing a rival service provisionally called Wingcast. If you lose your way in a car park, Wingcast will let you call the car on your mobile and honk the horn. And if the airbags inflate, Wingcast will assume you have been involved in an accident, call the emergency services, and tell them where you are. In Finland, tyre-maker Nokian Renkaat is developing \"smart tyres\" that use chips in each wheel to monitor pressure, temperature, wear and so on. If something goes wrong, they will be able to call the driver's Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone to report the problem. Last year when Ford unveiled its 24.7 concept car, which has an entirely \"soft\" (user-definable) dashboard, chief executive Jacques Nasser said: \"This is where the market is headed. It wasn't that we woke up one morning and said, 'Let's do this'. It's because that's where customers are headed.\" Facilities people have at home and in offices, they now want in their cars. Hardly anyone is promoting the idea of accessing websites on the move. \"It's not to do with using the internet per se,\" says Kerrigan, \"it's about the services you can render, whether it's information, or entertainment, or security and peace of mind.\" Jeremy Schwarz of US-based Forrester Research, who has just produced a report called Cars Get Wired, says safety is the number one concern for US consumers.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a visit to London after the second world war, the \"hardbitten\" movie star Edward G Robinson - in reality a sensitive art lover with a substantial collection of paintings - saw a picture of himself in an art dealer's shop. It was a menacing image, focusing on the luridly lit, sepia-toned faces of Robinson and co-star Joan Blondell in the 1936 film Bullets or Ballots, in which he played a goodie for a change. </p> <p>But the painting by Walter Sickert, famous for his dark impressions of women in lonely London rooms, makes Robinson look evil, his narrow-eyed face monstrously dominating the canvas. Robinson bought it at once; you can now see it in the National Portrait Gallery's Painting the Century show. </p> <p>Cinema holds a fatal attraction for painting. In the 20th century Hollywood created a new mythology, a new Olympus of gods and goddesses, and a new hell. Painters found the mythic narratives they had once taken from classical legends and the Bible remade, larger than life, in the dream world of cinema. At the same time Hollywood was the enemy, the Babylon of cheap popular entertainment - the kingdom of kitsch, according to critic Clement Greenberg, champion of high abstract art in the 1940s. </p> <p>Painting and cinema are still handcuffed together on a one-way ticket to the morgue. When artists appropriate images from film they always seem to be drawn to the melancholy underside of the tinsel factory. This week painter Mario Rossi's fascinating series of 100 pictures, The End/Untitled, goes on show at the windswept, modernist 1930s De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea. </p> <p>They depict the moment the words \"The End\" appear in 100 films. To see so many ends is hypnotically sad. Here are the two words written - in black and red, in gothic letters, in straight capitals - across terminal scenes you may or may not recognise: the car being pulled out of the swamp in Psycho; the assassins standing with their guns in The Killers; a man dead at the centre of a hammer and sickle in Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment. </p> <p>It doesn't matter whether or not you recognise the film. In each case there's a suggestive juxtaposition of word and image, inviting the viewer to complete the circle, to hypothesise a narrative. A plane flies over a landing strip; The End, say bold white letters superimposed over the screen. Two cigarettes smoulder in an ashtray; The End, say florid pink letters. An ocean liner sails against a spectacular sunset; The End, reads the ornately painted text. </p> <p>When did films stop saying The End? Except for the odd self-consciously camp exception (Rossi thinks the most recent in his collection is from Strictly Ballroom) the practice seems to have disappeared. Today films conclude with an interminable list of credits, but once they concluded properly with those magic words that tie up a story and give the weight of finality to a death or an embrace. </p> <p>Rossi's method is simply to use his video recorder to grab the final few moments of films, which he then paints in acrylics. He shows the paintings without labels, as a single large grid. The films in his collection are almost all classics, and part of the pleasure is recognising the last moments of some great movies: Cape Fear (the original), True Grit, The Big Sleep, Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz, The Rise and Fall of Louis XIV and, ahem, Ice Station Zebra and Live and Let Die. </p> <p>Painting and cinema both create fictional spaces, but the space of painting is static. So when a moment in a film is snatched and turned into a painting, it becomes deathly: you might call it painting noir. Painting takes a living, moving image and slows it down, making a monument to that which otherwise flits before our eyes. The movement of cinema is, of course, illusory. Painting kills the movement, reveals the stillness of the separate frames that underlie cinema, reveals death in the heart of life. The End. </p> <p>No wonder Edward G Robinson, who in the 1940s and 1950s appeared in such film noirs as Double Indemnity and The Woman in the Window, responded to the morbid, shadowy sensibility of Sickert's painting. It's a classic noir painting. So is another great cinema painting from the period, Edward Hopper's New York Movie (1939), set inside a 1930s cinema with palatial architecture. </p> <p>We only catch a glimpse, at the far left, of the silver screen and the backs of the heads of moviegoers, sitting alone as if they have gone by themselves to a matinee on a wet afternoon. The painting has panned back, away from the screen, to focus on an usherette standing at the side of the theatre under a yellow electric light, in front of a red-curtained exit. She's lost in misery and boredom, hand on chin, with no interest in the movie, and we are invited to imagine her story, a New York movie, a tale of solitude and loneliness. </p> <p>Hopper's sensibility influenced the look of film noir; his vision of solitary people in an all-night diner, Nighthawks, might be a storyboard painting for Robert Siodmak's The Killers, or Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past. When Hitchcock filmed the darkness at the edge of town in Psycho he based the gothic Bates mansion partly on Hopper's House by the Railroad. </p> <p>Mario Rossi's paintings are funny, charming but noirish too, because whether the characters are killers or lovers, their final destination is always The End. Even without those two words, the end of a film is an oddly destitute moment. </p> <p>All that light, all that action, all that absorption in a fictional world is gone. The words - the great, static final scenes - in these paintings mark the passing of the film; the cinematic equivalent of a gravestone. They are a cemetery of cinema and have the same romantic appeal as an overgrown Victorian graveyard or those Hollywood tours that show you where the stars died horrid deaths. </p> <p>The artist who used painting to make the deathliness of cinema explicit was Andy Warhol. Beginning with his portraits of Marilyn Monroe shortly after her death in 1962, Warhol froze the faces of screen icons and spectacular, cinematic moments from real life (a car crash with bodies thrown about, as in James Dean's death) in silkscreen paintings that dwell on mortality. Warhol took a film noir aesthetic and applied it, as Hopper did in Nighthawks, to everyday life. In Warhol's art The End is never far away. An electric chair waits to be used in a room with a sign that says Silence. A suicide throws herself out of a window. </p> <p>These are the images of everyday life on which Warhol fixated, moments that don't need the words The End for us to recognise their terminal nature. In an extraordinary series of noirish photographic works he made in the 1970s, to be seen shortly in the exhibition I Am a Camera at the Saatchi Gallery, Warhol records a world in which all the people seem to have disappeared, as in some 1950s sci-fi film, leaving only traces of themselves everywhere. </p> <p>In one picture a suitcase sits menacingly on a chair, perhaps containing the means of universal destruction, like the case the characters fight over in the film noir Kiss Me Deadly. In another monochrome shot, taken in a hairdressing salon and repeated melancholically four times, two overhead hairdryers hang above two empty chairs. To great emotional effect, one of the hairdryers is twisted round the face the other, as if the women had disappeared, dematerialised, in the middle of a gossipy chat. It makes you think of the casts of bodies at Pompeii. </p> <p>Mario Rossi's paintings are more optimistic because they look back to a Hollywood where The End came with due pomp, at the right time. For Warhol it doesn't come with a sign that says The End. </p> <p>Painting and making underground films at the end of the Hollywood studio era, Warhol captured the way The End interrupts the action just when you don't expect it, leaving everything in a mess, without finality, without a gravestone, without credits. Perhaps the reason cinema has abandoned those words The End is that we don't believe things are all tied up any more. But as Rossi's paintings ask, we can dream, can't we? </p> <p>\u0095 Mario Rossi: The End/Untitled is at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea (01424 787900), from Saturday to February 5.

In the 20th century Hollywood created a new mythology, a new Olympus of gods and goddesses, and a new hell. Painters found the mythic narratives they had once taken from classical legends and the Bible remade, larger than life, in the dream world of cinema. At the same time Hollywood was the enemy, the Babylon of cheap popular entertainment - the kingdom of kitsch, according to critic Clement Greenberg, champion of high abstract art in the 1940s. Painting and cinema are still handcuffed together on a one-way ticket to the morgue. When artists appropriate images from film they always seem to be drawn to the melancholy underside of the tinsel factory. This week painter Mario Rossi's fascinating series of 100 pictures, The End/Untitled, goes on show at the windswept, modernist 1930s De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea. They depict the moment the words \"The End\" appear in 100 films. To see so many ends is hypnotically sad. Here are the two words written - in black and red, in gothic letters, in straight capitals - across terminal scenes you may or may not recognise: the car being pulled out of the swamp in Psycho; the assassins standing with their guns in The Killers; a man dead at the centre of a hammer and sickle in Morgan: A Suitable Case for Treatment. It doesn't matter whether or not you recognise the film. In each case there's a suggestive juxtaposition of word and image, inviting the viewer to complete the circle, to hypothesise a narrative. A plane flies over a landing strip; The End, say bold white letters superimposed over the screen. Two cigarettes smoulder in an ashtray; The End, say florid pink letters. An ocean liner sails against a spectacular sunset; The End, reads the ornately painted text. When did films stop saying The End? Except for the odd self-consciously camp exception (Rossi thinks the most recent in his collection is from Strictly Ballroom) the practice seems to have disappeared. Today films conclude with an interminable list of credits, but once they concluded properly with those magic words that tie up a story and give the weight of finality to a death or an embrace. Rossi's method is simply to use his video recorder to grab the final few moments of films, which he then paints in acrylics. He shows the paintings without labels, as a single large grid. The films in his collection are almost all classics, and part of the pleasure is recognising the last moments of some great movies: Cape Fear (the original), True Grit, The Big Sleep, Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz, The Rise and Fall of Louis XIV and, ahem, Ice Station Zebra and Live and Let Die. Painting and cinema both create fictional spaces, but the space of painting is static. So when a moment in a film is snatched and turned into a painting, it becomes deathly: you might call it painting noir. Painting takes a living, moving image and slows it down, making a monument to that which otherwise flits before our eyes. The movement of cinema is, of course, illusory. Painting kills the movement, reveals the stillness of the separate frames that underlie cinema, reveals death in the heart of life. The End. No wonder Edward G Robinson, who in the 1940s and 1950s appeared in such film noirs as Double Indemnity and The Woman in the Window, responded to the morbid, shadowy sensibility of Sickert's painting. It's a classic noir painting. So is another great cinema painting from the period, Edward Hopper's New York Movie (1939), set inside a 1930s cinema with palatial architecture. We only catch a glimpse, at the far left, of the silver screen and the backs of the heads of moviegoers, sitting alone as if they have gone by themselves to a matinee on a wet afternoon. The painting has panned back, away from the screen, to focus on an usherette standing at the side of the theatre under a yellow electric light, in front of a red-curtained exit. She's lost in misery and boredom, hand on chin, with no interest in the movie, and we are invited to imagine her story, a New York movie, a tale of solitude and loneliness. Hopper's sensibility influenced the look of film noir; his vision of solitary people in an all-night diner, Nighthawks, might be a storyboard painting for Robert Siodmak's The Killers, or Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past. When Hitchcock filmed the darkness at the edge of town in Psycho he based the gothic Bates mansion partly on Hopper's House by the Railroad. Mario Rossi's paintings are funny, charming but noirish too, because whether the characters are killers or lovers, their final destination is always The End. Even without those two words, the end of a film is an oddly destitute moment. All that light, all that action, all that absorption in a fictional world is gone. The words - the great, static final scenes - in these paintings mark the passing of the film; the cinematic equivalent of a gravestone. They are a cemetery of cinema and have the same romantic appeal as an overgrown Victorian graveyard or those Hollywood tours that show you where the stars died horrid deaths. The artist who used painting to make the deathliness of cinema explicit was Andy Warhol. Beginning with his portraits of Marilyn Monroe shortly after her death in 1962, Warhol froze the faces of screen icons and spectacular, cinematic moments from real life (a car crash with bodies thrown about, as in James Dean's death) in silkscreen paintings that dwell on mortality. Warhol took a film noir aesthetic and applied it, as Hopper did in Nighthawks, to everyday life. In Warhol's art The End is never far away. An electric chair waits to be used in a room with a sign that says Silence. A suicide throws herself out of a window. These are the images of everyday life on which Warhol fixated, moments that don't need the words The End for us to recognise their terminal nature. In an extraordinary series of noirish photographic works he made in the 1970s, to be seen shortly in the exhibition I Am a Camera at the Saatchi Gallery, Warhol records a world in which all the people seem to have disappeared, as in some 1950s sci-fi film, leaving only traces of themselves everywhere. In one picture a suitcase sits menacingly on a chair, perhaps containing the means of universal destruction, like the case the characters fight over in the film noir Kiss Me Deadly. In another monochrome shot, taken in a hairdressing salon and repeated melancholically four times, two overhead hairdryers hang above two empty chairs. To great emotional effect, one of the hairdryers is twisted round the face the other, as if the women had disappeared, dematerialised, in the middle of a gossipy chat. It makes you think of the casts of bodies at Pompeii. Mario Rossi's paintings are more optimistic because they look back to a Hollywood where The End came with due pomp, at the right time. For Warhol it doesn't come with a sign that says The End. Painting and making underground films at the end of the Hollywood studio era, Warhol captured the way The End interrupts the action just when you don't expect it, leaving everything in a mess, without finality, without a gravestone, without credits. Perhaps the reason cinema has abandoned those words The End is that we don't believe things are all tied up any more. But as Rossi's paintings ask, we can dream, can't we? \u0095 Mario Rossi: The End/Untitled is at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea (01424 787900), from Saturday to February 5.

She is a passionate European and a devoted Labourite, and public service, she says, \"runs in her blood\". But she finds herself adrift and she is not alone - a fact pointed up by a new report into women in public life.</p> <p>Eighteen months ago, Tongue unexpectedly lost her seat as the Labour MEP for London East. Thus ended two decades of working for the European Union, first as an employee and then, for 15 years, as a politician. Now, as Nice gets under way and the talk is of vetos, Euro-armies and the EU as a British curse, Tongue, 45, paints a far more positive, feminised portrait of Europe. One in which, for instance, the loss of cultural identity is about as likely as a revival of the ducking stool for suspected witchcraft.</p> <p>Tongue says she would enjoy a role \"making Britain more European in outlook\". She wishes the government would \"proselytise and extol\", and go more on the offensive. She points out that, however flawed, much of the legislation that has made an impact on women's lives in the UK originated in Strasbourg: sex discrimination, equal pay for work of equal value, pro rata rights for part-timers.</p> <p>Focus groups conducted by the women's campaigning group the Fawcett Society reveal, however, that many women lack basic information about Europe. Labour may have female voices at Westminster happy to make the positive case - but when are they allowed to be heard?</p> <p>Tongue, who speaks English, French and German fluently, was born in Lausanne; her parents divorced and her father married a Hungarian. Now, in her north London home, between frequent dives into her bag for yet more fags, she talks enthusiastically of the way in which the EU, for example, is trying to dismantle the class divide in culture. She speaks in short bursts, leaving long pauses - a habit presumably gained in Strasbourg, working to the rhythm of interpreters.</p> <p>During her years as an MEP, she concentrated first on regeneration, helping to secure over \u00a3150m in European funding in east London over a two-year period. Then, in 1994, she was elected socialist group coordinator for the EC's culture, youth, education and media committee, becoming the European Parliament spokesperson on public service broadcasting. She continues to be one of its fiercest defenders.</p> <p>She is involved now in a project called Cybercinema which, she says, is a striking example of what a Pan-European perspective can achieve. The aim is to create a network of digital cinema \"spaces\", reaching disadvantaged areas here and across Europe. Dubbed films will be offered each week, mostly European, with an opportunity for interactive links between audiences. World cinema, Tongue says, makes up only 1% of the UK market; American films swallow 75-90% of European distribution. Cybercinema will offer an alternative.</p> <p>\"If you don't give people the images that carry within them the clues to the identity of others,\" Tongue says, \"how can we expect the citizens of tomorrow to feel an empathy with those in neighbouring countries? If you give children the audiovisual equivalent of a hamburger, then how can they appreciate diversity?\"</p> <p>Tongue patently does not share New Labour's delight in all things American. She was strongly critical of Murdoch's anti-European views when Blair was wooing the Sun and has always supported proportional representation - the system that ousted her from her seat.</p> <p>Others say these streaks of independence were the reason she was placed fifth on the party list in the last European election - and joined the growing band of women undervalued by the party. In modernised, transparent Britain, the panel who made the selection was not required to make its reasoning known. \"Such is life in politics,\" is Tongue's guarded comment.</p> <p>Later, when Tongue was offered a second chance, she decided against returning to the EC. As a divorced parent, she says her daughter, aged seven, needs her at home more. She has co-founded a consultancy but would also like to move into public service - an ambition that brings her up against another hard place.</p> <p>Last month, Public Service Week was held, designed to raise awareness, particularly among women and ethnic minorities, of the establishment's need for people to sit on quangos, such as NHS trusts, boards of museums and health and safety committees. Tongue is one of a number of women, black, brown and white, who have not found it easy to break into this world. She is a trustee of several organisations and an international speaker - but none of this adds up to the cv of the individual most favoured for a quango: a middle-aged man in a senior position in industry.</p> <p>Ten years ago, the Hansard Society published Women on Top, an investigation into why women were invisible in the higher ranks. Next week comes an updated report. Over the decade, targets have been introduced and the post of public appointments commissioner was created to act as a watchdog but, overall, according to Dr Karen Ross of Coventry University, author of the new report, progress has been slow. The proportion of women public appointees stood at 23% in 1991 and 30% in 1995, but since then there has been an increase of only 3%. Exceptions exist. At the Department of Health, for instance, 44% of public appointees are women.</p> <p>The 1990 report indicated that a major hurdle was attitudinal and Ross says the problem remains. The public appointments unit, which finds suitable candidates for significant appointments, has increased the number of searches it has made for women candidates by 75% over the past five years, yet the number of placements is static (105 in 1995, 104 in 1999-2000). Women are now at the top of the queue but still failing to find a seat on the bus.</p> <p>\"The rhetoric has improved but not the reality,\" Ross says. \"The previous report believed that as half the professions were recruiting females, more and more would filter up to the top. Well, it's 10 years on and they haven't.\"</p> <p>Tongue was only 28 when, in 1984, she stood for selection for London East. \"Fired up by mother's part-time work experience,\" she said, \"[I argued] that working people must unite across frontiers to achieve common goals of social justice, economic prosperity and a sustainable environment in a multinational economy.\" That's not so scary, is it?

Then, regarding audience response, I think of Carl Andre's celebrated bricks: \"Is that it?\" \"Yes.\" \"But there's not much of it?\" \"It's minimalist.\" I won't even start with Waiting for Godot in which virtually every line seems apposite: \"I can't go on like this.\" \"That's what you think.\" Or: \"You want me to pull off my trousers?\" \"Pull on your trousers.\" It's all so true. And, come to think of it, I do play a woman's body like a violin, but then you haven't heard me play the violin. \u0095 Catherine Bennett is away.",

This year, the charade of the Queen's Speech matched reality with a precision that was more offensive. For the reality this time is itself largely a pretence. The joke was a double-take. The tabards and the ermine and the backwards-walking and the doffing and crawling, all accompanied by the reverential commentary of David Dimbleby, disguised a new kind of story. Instead of being witnesses to a comical disjunction between roseate myth and gritty reality, these people were stage extras in a masquerade, whereby the Gracious Speech was converted from a government statement into an election address.</p> <p>It was followed by earnest assessments of what, in the legislative programme, was most significant, what interesting directions the government was taking, how its proposed assaults on delinquency, now the epicentre of the third way project, might work. But few of these things will come to pass. Every conversation I've had in government circles assumes, with revealing incaution, that the election will of course be next May. That means a dissolution in March. It is clear that very few laws will be passed by Commons and Lords before then. So what we heard yesterday was something new: pre-election monarchical soundbites put to the service of the Labour party, in a theatre where the empress has all too many clothes.</p> <p>At the heart of this is a kind of theft of democracy which could do with more attention. In 1997, the people gave Labour a five-year mandate which, it's now taken for granted, can gratuitously be reduced to four. That, after all, was what the Thatcher government did in 1983 and 1987. But yesterday's performance makes one see more clearly how unacceptable such manipulations are. No need of state presses the case for an election next year. No parliamentary or political crisis is in the wings, demanding therapeutic closure by the people. The product of the queenly charade will either be no laws, or else, in the few cases to which priority time is given, bad laws hustled through without proper scrutiny to meet the artificial deadline of a premature election.</p> <p>The case for fixed parliaments, disallowing such blatant exploitation, is perhaps less urgent than it was before the Bank of England took control of monetary policy. That shift removed from chancellors one of the tools with which they have often organised economic policy to fit short-term electoral needs, and to hell with long-term effects. But Gordon Brown is demonstrating that budgetary policy can serve a similar purpose. Timing the disgorgement of billions on public services has been finely calculated. It's partly because of fears for an economic downturn later in 2001 that ministers are keen to get the election out of the way as soon as possible.</p> <p>Fixed-term parliaments, of four or five years, would not be easy to run. There would need to be a mechanism to accommodate a government's loss of a confidence vote. Germany, a parliamentary system where the fixed-term principle applies, has a let-out clause requiring a dissolution if a confidence vote is lost. In 1972 and 1983, incumbent governments that wanted a dissolution manoeuvred to lose their own confidence votes, and thus precipitate an election. But since then the constitutional court has stepped in to prevent such finagling. If Britain adopted a similar rule, the no-confidence problem could be dealt with - Ferdinand Mount, a former Thatcher adviser, suggested this in his book, The British Constitution Now - by enlisting the judicial committee of the Privy Council to advise the monarch, who now has exclusive dissolving power, on whether the objective conditions for a dissolution had really been met. Updated, this can be Young's contribution to the Guardian campaign to down-scale the monarchy, though I'm not for abolition.</p> <p>The case for fixed terms is that the summoning of parliaments should be beyond the manipulation of monarch, faction or prime minister. The system should enhance citizenship not subjecthood. \"The fixed periodicity dignifies the people's choice,\" writes Mount, meaning that \"the result of the election is the outcome of a regular constitutional process, instead of, as at present, a more or less successful confidence trick by the prime minister\". A firm framework of election dates would make life more predictable, in one respect at least, for the interests that now have to wait on the whim of the prime minister.</p> <p>Fixed-term government, it's true, produces a fixed-term build-up of campaigning. No sooner will George W Bush have been installed as president than Al Gore and a clutch of Democrat rivals will start preparing for the 2004 election. There's no escaping, in modern times, the sense of the permanent campaign. But when the timing is orchestrated by one leader, it seems quite excessive to mobilise the state landau, and the Australian coach, and the whole trotting throng of Horse Guards and Life Guards, together with processions of heralds and bishops and judges, to help him arrange it to maximum advantage a year ahead of time.</p> <p>We now face four months of incessant election campaigning. That's the only thing government will be about. It won't produce better laws or wiser long-term decisions. Not only will the anti-crime laws be a series of hasty knee-jerks, but consider how different Britain's conduct of this week's negotiations at Nice might be if Blair wasn't tied to an election in May. With 18 months rather than four to go, he would be less conscious of the Sun's noxious fumes coursing down his neck. As it is, boxed in by his own decision to prepare everything for going early, he's pushed all the time to talk something like the same language of veto and national sovereignty as John Major.</p> <p>That, too, may be a given of modern political life. The power of the British media tends to ensure that the government thinks it has to be campaigning for survival all the time. But the scenes in the throne-room of the Lords yesterday were especially unhappy. Somehow they debased both the government and the Queen. Ministers embrace the flummery with evident pleasure, but also with calculation. The Queen, unvoted and unvoting, is their electoral creature. And in six months' time, the Lord Great Chamberlain will be hoisting on the ermine all over again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

It seemed prudent to consult the two greatest living desert travellers, the other being Wilfred Thesiger, who over lunch at the Travellers' Club, made it plain he thought I was engaged in a stunt which had little hope of success. Monod - who knew far more about the Sahara - encouraged me from the start: in correspondence, where his utterly practical advice was seeded with quotations from Edward Lear; at his country retreat at Colomieres where we spent hours poring over maps while Th\u00e9o suggested possible routes; and at his Paris apartment where we would discuss the impenetrable topicality of Giles cartoons and the relative merits of the English and the French prismatic compasses. Everything he said was designed to make me believe that I might become the first man to complete that crossing alone. (I didn't, having to give up through illness after 2,000 miles). His last piece of advice was: \"Take plenty of string. It's always very useful.\" When my account of the journey was published, Th\u00e9o wrote to say how pleased he was that it had been reviewed in Paris together with one of his own titles that had just been reprinted. He sent me a copy of M\u00e9har\u00e9es and inscribed it \"To my fellow m\u00e9harist\". I was, and am, very proud of that. Geoffrey Moorhouse",

      "body": "<p>The literary career of Gwendolyn Brooks, who has died aged 83, was distinguished enough to be coveted by any writer but it is also axiomatic that, being black and a woman, she achieved more than her fair share of \"firsts\" in a vocation that spanned eight decades. The first African-American to win the Pulitzer Prize (1950) and to be appointed to the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1976), she became poet laureate of Illinois in 1968.</p> <p>She was born in her grand mother's home of Topeka, Kansas, the first child of David Brooks - son of a runaway slave - and Keziah Brooks. The month-old Gwendolyn was taken by her parents to Chicago and remained a \"Chicagoan\" all her life. A shy, bookish child, she developed an early passion for poetry and in 1930 her first published verse appeared in American Childhood magazine. By the age of 17 Brooks was submitting work to the weekly poetry column of the Chicago Defender, in which she published almost a hundred poems.</p> <p>Graduating from college during the Depression, she did secretarial work, then in 1939 married Henry Blakely, also an aspiring writer. They divorced in 1969 but were reunited four years later. Her first collection of poetry, A Street in Bronzeville (1945) depicted everyday black life on Chicago's South Side, peopled with memorable characters. In 1946 she won a Guggenheim fellowship, as well as a $1000 award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p> <p>It was for her second collection, Annie Allen (1949), that she was awarded the Pulitzer. A sequence of poems about a black girl growing up in Chicago, it won particular praise for Brooks' innovation in poetic technique, the sonnet-ballad. A poetic oeuvre grew to include more than a dozen books, including Bronzeville Boys and Girls (1956), The Bean Eaters (1960), Selected Poems (1963) and In the Mecca (1968), nominated for a National Book Award.</p> <p>Her reputation as a poet somewhat overshadowed her only novel, Maud Martha (1953), which is, in many ways, a significant precursor of more recent fiction by African-American women. Written with an affecting precision that details the process by which the young woman protagonist gradually matures, Brooks acknowledged its similarities to the trajectory, if not the specifics, of her own life: \"There's fact-meat in the soup, among the chunks of fancy.\"</p> <p>More specific autobiogra phy was included in her 1972 book, Report From Part One - a medley of reminiscences, interviews, photographs and vignettes, in which Brooks tellingly writes: \"Are you aware of a fact-that-should-be startling about the High Days of my youth? All were Europe-rooted or America-rooted. Not one celebration in my black household or in any black household that I knew featured any black glory or greatness or grandeur. A capricious bunch of entries and responses has brought me to my present understanding of fertile facts. Know-nows: I know now that I am essentially an essential African, in occupancy here because of an indeed 'peculiar' institution. I know that the black emphasis must be, not against white, but FOR black .\"</p> <p>Though she had become an established and respected talent after starting out as a \"literary integrationist\", Brooks might have been marginalised by more strident black writings of the civil rights era, had she not been open to change and development in herself. She was clear about the moment that she rediscovered awareness of her blackness: it was in 1967 at a Fisk University writers' conference addressed by an angry LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka). Thereafter she was increasingly concerned with accessibility: \"My aim, in the next future, is to write poems that will somehow successfully 'call' all black people: black people in taverns, black people in alleys, black people in gutters, schools, offices, factories, prisons, the consulate; I wish to reach black people in pulpits, black people in mines, on farms, on thrones; not always to 'teach' - I shall wish often to entertain, to illumine.\"</p> <p>Her increasing concern for accessibility and affordable pricing led her to move publishers, to small local presses such as the black imprint Broadside Press - with whom she published the chapbooks Riot (1969) and Family Pictures (1970). She also established her own outlet, the David Company (named for her father). She also produced many works of non-fiction, works for children, essays and reviews. Her idealism was untarnished by age and she was almost 80 when Report From Part Two appeared in 1995.</p> <p>Her commitment remained steadfast - \"I am interested in telling my particular truth as I have seen it\" - yet her tone was gently insistent rather than dogmatic. Typically, she wrote in Corners of the Curving Sky:</p> <p>Our earth is round, and, among other things</p> <p>That means that you and I can hold</p> <p>Completely different</p> <p>Points of view and both be right.</p> <p>The difference of our positions will show</p> <p>Stars in your window I cannot even imagine.</p> <p>Your sky may burn with light,</p> <p>While mine, at the same moment,</p> <p>Spreads beautiful to darkness.</p> <p>Still, we must choose how we separately corner</p> <p>The circling universe of our experience.</p> <p>Once chosen, our cornering will determine</p> <p>The message of any star and darkness we encounter.</p> <p>She is survived by a daughter and a son. <br><br>Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks, writer, born June 7 1917; died December 3 2000</p>",

A poetic oeuvre grew to include more than a dozen books, including Bronzeville Boys and Girls (1956), The Bean Eaters (1960), Selected Poems (1963) and In the Mecca (1968), nominated for a National Book Award. Her reputation as a poet somewhat overshadowed her only novel, Maud Martha (1953), which is, in many ways, a significant precursor of more recent fiction by African-American women. Written with an affecting precision that details the process by which the young woman protagonist gradually matures, Brooks acknowledged its similarities to the trajectory, if not the specifics, of her own life: \"There's fact-meat in the soup, among the chunks of fancy.\" More specific autobiogra phy was included in her 1972 book, Report From Part One - a medley of reminiscences, interviews, photographs and vignettes, in which Brooks tellingly writes: \"Are you aware of a fact-that-should-be startling about the High Days of my youth? All were Europe-rooted or America-rooted. Not one celebration in my black household or in any black household that I knew featured any black glory or greatness or grandeur. A capricious bunch of entries and responses has brought me to my present understanding of fertile facts. Know-nows: I know now that I am essentially an essential African, in occupancy here because of an indeed 'peculiar' institution. I know that the black emphasis must be, not against white, but FOR black .\" Though she had become an established and respected talent after starting out as a \"literary integrationist\", Brooks might have been marginalised by more strident black writings of the civil rights era, had she not been open to change and development in herself. She was clear about the moment that she rediscovered awareness of her blackness: it was in 1967 at a Fisk University writers' conference addressed by an angry LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka). Thereafter she was increasingly concerned with accessibility: \"My aim, in the next future, is to write poems that will somehow successfully 'call' all black people: black people in taverns, black people in alleys, black people in gutters, schools, offices, factories, prisons, the consulate; I wish to reach black people in pulpits, black people in mines, on farms, on thrones; not always to 'teach' - I shall wish often to entertain, to illumine.\" Her increasing concern for accessibility and affordable pricing led her to move publishers, to small local presses such as the black imprint Broadside Press - with whom she published the chapbooks Riot (1969) and Family Pictures (1970). She also established her own outlet, the David Company (named for her father). She also produced many works of non-fiction, works for children, essays and reviews. Her idealism was untarnished by age and she was almost 80 when Report From Part Two appeared in 1995. Her commitment remained steadfast - \"I am interested in telling my particular truth as I have seen it\" - yet her tone was gently insistent rather than dogmatic. Typically, she wrote in Corners of the Curving Sky: Our earth is round, and, among other things That means that you and I can hold Completely different Points of view and both be right. The difference of our positions will show Stars in your window I cannot even imagine. Your sky may burn with light, While mine, at the same moment, Spreads beautiful to darkness. Still, we must choose how we separately corner The circling universe of our experience. Once chosen, our cornering will determine The message of any star and darkness we encounter. She is survived by a daughter and a son. Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks, writer, born June 7 1917; died December 3 2000",

It is easy to see how consumers took against GM soyabean which offered no benefit to anyone except Monsanto, but when a cure for cancer is at stake - one in three dies of the disease - biotechnology will no longer be seen as a playground for multinationals but as a vital hope to relieve suffering.",

      "body": "<p>As any visitor to Winnie The Pooh's Hundred-Acre Wood will tell you, Tiggers Don't Climb Trees. Dinosaurs, however, might not have had such scruples. Today's Nature contains a report of a new and very small feathered dinosaur that could have made its home in the Six Pine Trees. </p> <p>From a distance, Microraptor zhaoianus would have looked like a bedraggled blackbird. Indeed, we might have had a hard time telling the difference between microraptor and birds. </p> <p>And this would have been a nice conundrum - for microraptor was much more closely related to ground-living predators such as velociraptor than to early birds such as the magpie-sized archaeopteryx. </p> <p>As Xing Xu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleonthropology in Beijing and his colleagues report, microraptor is the first, full-grown dinosaur to be found that is smaller than archaeopteryx, the canonical first bird. As such, microraptor - from the 125-million-year-old rocks in north-east China that have yielded many fossils of birds and feathered dinosaurs - crosses the palaeontological rubicon. </p> <p>Here's why. Most palaeontologists accept that birds evolved from somewhere within a large group of two- legged predators, the theropods. Conventional wisdom has it that these creatures kept both feet firmly on the ground, while the first birds took off from it. However, the evolution of birds was accompanied by a general diminution, so that the earliest known bird, 150-million-year-old archaeopteryx, could have alighted on your shoulder - unlike a Tyrannosaurus rex. A small and vociferous group of researchers has argued that birds and dinosaurs are not close relatives at all, that archaeopteryx evolved from a tree-like creature, which took off from branches rather than from the ground. </p> <p>Although few would now seriously doubt the close relationship between birds and theropod dinosaurs, the difference between the two camps has been marked by the assumption that if birds and theropods were closely related, then the ancestors of birds would have taken off from the ground, not from trees. But evidence of relationship - deduced by close study of the anatomy of living and fossil creatures - need say little about how those creatures behaved. For example, goats, unlike Tiggers, are excellent tree-climbers, even if their anatomy suggests a ground-living lifestyle. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina (a leading critic of the bird-dinosaur consensus) has shown how the claws of archaeopteryx look more like those of modern perching birds than ground-living birds. </p> <p>This influential study might say something about the habits of birds, but less about archaeopteryx, but nothing at all about bird-dinosaur relationships. Even so, the value of this comparative study has been lessened by the presumption that the behaviour of ancestral birds is a clue to relationships, and the assumption of Feduccia's critics that the ancestors of birds were ground-living runners anyway. </p> <p>Enter tiny, feathered microraptor, a midget version of velociraptor with a long tail, a head the size of a thumbnail and an incomplete trunk thought to be less than two inches long. Xu and colleagues, strong advocates of the bird-dinosaur consensus, are in no doubt that microraptor is a dinosaur, and a member of a group of otherwise ground-living theropods that were close cousins (if not the ancestors) of birds. Nevertheless, in a significant nod to Feduccia, they show that the claws of microraptor are stronglysuggestive of a life spent in the trees rather than on the ground. \"The theropod ancestors of birds may have passed through an arboreal phase\", the researchers suggest. Although the legs, tail and skull are well-preserved, little remains of the trunk or arms, so the researchers have no idea if microraptor could have flown, as archaeopteryx is believed to have done. If microraptor were a flyer, it would be the first case of a dinosaur, other than birds themselves, taking to the skies. </p> <p>The line between birds and dinosaurs was challenged by the discovery of archaeopteryx in 1861. But it has become dangerously thin since the discovery of a series of feathered dinosaurs from China and elsewhere in the 1990s. With microraptor, in 2000, the line has vanished. </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.</p>",

As Xing Xu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleonthropology in Beijing and his colleagues report, microraptor is the first, full-grown dinosaur to be found that is smaller than archaeopteryx, the canonical first bird. As such, microraptor - from the 125-million-year-old rocks in north-east China that have yielded many fossils of birds and feathered dinosaurs - crosses the palaeontological rubicon. Here's why. Most palaeontologists accept that birds evolved from somewhere within a large group of two- legged predators, the theropods. Conventional wisdom has it that these creatures kept both feet firmly on the ground, while the first birds took off from it. However, the evolution of birds was accompanied by a general diminution, so that the earliest known bird, 150-million-year-old archaeopteryx, could have alighted on your shoulder - unlike a Tyrannosaurus rex. A small and vociferous group of researchers has argued that birds and dinosaurs are not close relatives at all, that archaeopteryx evolved from a tree-like creature, which took off from branches rather than from the ground. Although few would now seriously doubt the close relationship between birds and theropod dinosaurs, the difference between the two camps has been marked by the assumption that if birds and theropods were closely related, then the ancestors of birds would have taken off from the ground, not from trees. But evidence of relationship - deduced by close study of the anatomy of living and fossil creatures - need say little about how those creatures behaved. For example, goats, unlike Tiggers, are excellent tree-climbers, even if their anatomy suggests a ground-living lifestyle. Nevertheless, Alan Feduccia of the University of North Carolina (a leading critic of the bird-dinosaur consensus) has shown how the claws of archaeopteryx look more like those of modern perching birds than ground-living birds. This influential study might say something about the habits of birds, but less about archaeopteryx, but nothing at all about bird-dinosaur relationships. Even so, the value of this comparative study has been lessened by the presumption that the behaviour of ancestral birds is a clue to relationships, and the assumption of Feduccia's critics that the ancestors of birds were ground-living runners anyway. Enter tiny, feathered microraptor, a midget version of velociraptor with a long tail, a head the size of a thumbnail and an incomplete trunk thought to be less than two inches long. Xu and colleagues, strong advocates of the bird-dinosaur consensus, are in no doubt that microraptor is a dinosaur, and a member of a group of otherwise ground-living theropods that were close cousins (if not the ancestors) of birds. Nevertheless, in a significant nod to Feduccia, they show that the claws of microraptor are stronglysuggestive of a life spent in the trees rather than on the ground. \"The theropod ancestors of birds may have passed through an arboreal phase\", the researchers suggest. Although the legs, tail and skull are well-preserved, little remains of the trunk or arms, so the researchers have no idea if microraptor could have flown, as archaeopteryx is believed to have done. If microraptor were a flyer, it would be the first case of a dinosaur, other than birds themselves, taking to the skies. The line between birds and dinosaurs was challenged by the discovery of archaeopteryx in 1861. But it has become dangerously thin since the discovery of a series of feathered dinosaurs from China and elsewhere in the 1990s. With microraptor, in 2000, the line has vanished. \u0095 Henry Gee is a senior editor of Nature.",

Family rows can easily erupt over anything from the numbers on your guest list to who keeps an eye on granny's gin-drinking at the reception. But David Lethbridge, co-founder of Confetti, the UK's leading wedding site, believes the web can help to substantially reduce the traditional tensions. </p> <p>Chat rooms on <a href=\"http://www.confetti.co.uk \" target=\"_new\">Confetti's</a> site let brides-to-be pour out their frustrations to one another and they can also confide in Betti, the site's online wedding agony aunt. \"They want advice and they want to discuss friends and family,\" Lethbridge says. \"Their normal network is a problem. Having an independent network is very powerful.\" </p> <p> As well as helping its customers to tie the knot, Confetti has been busy over the last couple of months seeking new partners for itself. In September, Confetti snapped up its two arch-rivals, Wedding GuideUK.com and WebWeddings.co.uk and at a stroke became the major UK online player in a market which Forrester analysts estimate is worth about \u00a37.6 billion annually when you take into account wedding advertising, gifts and honeymoons. </p> <p> Coupled with its French site and two sister sites in Germany, Confetti is shaping up to become a major European player and appears to be advancing swiftly towards its goal of becoming an indispensable resource for people organising weddings. On the site, you can chat to online vicars, plan your budget, book limos, prepare speeches, hire venues and buy wedding dresses. </p> <p> \"We are doing more than 10 million page impressions across Europe a month. Six million of those are in the UK,\" boasts Lethbridge. But he knows that page impressions by themselves are not worth much to hard-nosed investors unless they are generating serious amounts of revenue. </p> <p> Having expanded ambitiously into Europe at a time when grabbing land was the mantra of most VCs, Confetti is now consolidating and focusing on making its UK operation profitable. They hope to generate substantial revenue as the result of a major e-commerce deal which has recently been struck with the wedding list business, Burley House. </p> <p> The deal gives Confetti access to a wide selection of gift products produced by a range of well-known retail partners including Jasper Conran. Another key leading gift service provider will be Marks and Spencer who have agreed to cross promote Confetti's services to their own customers. </p> <p> But most significantly, the agreement with Burley House means that Confetti now owns a personalised fulfilment service which is being run out of Bradford in Yorkshire. Lethbridge can barely conceal his delight. \"It's going to be a killer service,\" he says, adding that Confetti will have the capability to deliver wedding gifts all in one go to a bride's address rather than in dribs and drabs when they are bought from the list. </p> <p> On the surface, Burley House does look like the perfect match for Confetti but analysts point out that there could be problems negotiating with the different retailers before the service goes live in January next year. </p> <p> \"Getting the e-commerce up and running is their next big challenge,\" says Forrester analyst, Rebecca Ulph. She points out that Marks and Spencer's gift offering might not be the ideal choice for all couples who often like to place their lists with different shops. Furthermore, with retailers replicating each other's gift products, Confetti faces difficult negotiations with them to agree which of their products will actually make it onto the final online list. </p> <p> To generate repeat business from newly weds, Confetti plans to extend its business beyond weddings. Lethbridge says: \"We believe we can keep people longer by using us for special occasions.\" </p> <p>However analysts think the decision to diversify into special occasions such as anniversaries and birthdays needs to be carefully managed otherwise Confetti could dilute its brand and drift into potentially damaging competition with the likes of LastMinute and Expedia. </p> <p> With its main UK competitors in the bag and considering the deals with Marks and Spencer and Burley House, Lethbridge believes Confetti is now virtually impregnable against any rival onslaughts. \"I would not want to launch against us.There will always be niche competition but I think we will have the core share of the business.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.alafolie.com \" target=\"_new\">Alafolie</a>, the French-owned wedding organisation portal, begs to differ.

It is a pretty big wedding market and there is high internet penetration.\" </p> <p> Alafolie has already tried to court Confetti and at one stage there were rumours of a merger. But Alafolie's advances were spurned and now the French-owned e-business is in discussions with several potential strategic partners to try to sweep Confetti out of its primary position in the wedding marketplace . \"If we take on Confetti on their own turf, we're going to have to be clever,\" says Shetty, who likes to portray his portal as more upmarket and far more \"tasteful\" than Confetti's. </p> <p> Shetty rejects suggestions that a French-owned site will have difficulties shaping its content to match the customs and traditions of the UK wedding market and points out that Alafolie is already providing services to brides- to- be in Germany and Italy. </p> <p> A s the online wedding market consolidates in the UK and continental players weigh up their chances of success, analysts are questioning the impact that interactive wedding sites will have on traditional UK wedding magazines. \"I don't think a website will ever replace a bridal magazine.

      "body": "<p>In the 1940s Dr. William Grey Walter built some of the first artificial animals. More than half a century later, these first robots are providing the inspiration for a new race of mechanical creatures. </p> <p>Walter called his machines tortoises, after the tortoise in Alice in Wonderland. The mock turtle explains to Alice that \"we went to school in the sea. The Master was an old turtle, we used to call him Tortoise.\" Alice interrupts to ask why he called him tortoise if he wasn't one. \"We called him tortoise because he taught us,\" replies the mock turtle angrily. </p> <p>Walter was one of the most distinguished neurophysiologists of his day. He developed these robot tortoises to help him understand how the brain functions. The first two, Elmer and Elsie, were cannibalised to create another six tortoises with the help of his technician, \"Bunny\" Warren. </p> <p>Two were destroyed in a house fire in Australia, others were turned into scrap metal, or lost in transit between museums; fortunately one, possibly two, survived. Before his death, Walter passed a tortoise on to his son Nicholas, who kept it safe until Brunel University decided to repair it and use it for an exhibition in 1985. Some time later, Nicholas Walter discovered that it was about to be thrown out and rescued it; the last tortoise languished in his basement in Islington until 1995. </p> <p>Then Owen Holland, from the University of the West of England, restored it to Bristol where Walter lived and worked. Holland, senior technician Ian Horsfield, and Bunny Warren, restored the turtle to working order and have built replicas. </p> <p>What Walter's tortoise did was travel towards a light. He called the creature Machina speculatrix because, \"it explores its environment actively, persistently, systematically, as most animals do\". Most of the time the robot behaved as expected, but when put in front of a mirror, it began \"flickering, twittering and jigging like a clumsy narcissus,\" wrote Walter. </p> <p>He argued that this behaviour was evidence of self-awareness. Most scientists today do not believe robots can show self-awareness, but as Holland says, \"Walter wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells produces very rich behaviour.\" Few of Walter's theories about neurophysiology and the brain are respected today, but his work on the artificial animals has taken on new life. Even more importantly, the tortoises helped scientists to realise that complex behaviour can be generated by using just a few components, and that biological principles can be applied to the field of robotics. </p> <p>These lessons have been taken to heart by the intelligent autonomous systems laboratory at the University of the West of England where a replica of Walter's tortoise is housed in its original hutch. The first thing one sees when one walks into the robotics laboratory, is a large arena full of robots bumbling around, carrying out seemingly purposeless tasks. These U-bots, as they're called, have no eyes, they can't count, they don't know who they are, and they're not aware of anyone or anything else, yet they manage to sort coloured plates into piles of the correct colour. It takes them hours, but they get there in the end. </p> <p>They are an example of an intelligent robot according to Dr Chris Melhuish, a director of the lab. They are \"doing the right thing an adequate amount of times,\" he says, which is his current definition of intelligence. Strangely, for the director of a robotics department, he doesn't seem to know what a robot is. The definition he eventually settles on is that robots are \"a collection of technologies, probably mobile, hopefully autonomous, capable of acting on the environment in a seemingly goal oriented way.\" By trial and error, Melhuish and his team came up with four very simple rules which enabled the U-bots to carry out their task adequately. </p> <p>According to him, the robots behave like ants. \"Ants are a miracle of evolution and engineering,\" he says. \"An individual isn't very sophisticated and isn't capable of doing very much on its own, but put 20 million army ants together and watch out! They're capable of work scheduling, seeking their own energy, building homes and looking after the brood. They carry out everything that goes on in a city, and yet no single ant has the blue-print for their workload.\" In Antz, the movie, the queen constantly issued instructions, but this is not what happens in an ant colony. \"Ant colonies are actually examples of a wonderful de- centralised intelligence,\" says Melhuish, \"without consciousness and self-awareness. They are our inspiration.\" </p> <p>The lab also houses a small group of robots; Jason Welsby, the PhD student who created them, was inspired, not by ants, but by birds. The robots themselves look neither like birds nor even vaguely like robots. Called Blimps, they're small helium balloons with propellers and a battery slung beneath. They float in small silver flocks round the lab. Each one uses ultrasound to determine how far away the floor and the ceiling are. They keep track of each other with infrared transmitters and receivers and they follow three very simple rules: (1) Keep together; (2) Head in the same general direction and (3) Don't stay too close to other individuals. It sounds like a motto for the office. </p> <p>\"The hardware is not particularly useful because it's very vulnerable. The robots can't travel outside,\" says Welsby, \"but the software could be useful.\" He envisages more robust robots being sent to disaster areas to sweep paths looking for survivors. He adds: \"They could also be used in space exploration. You could send 50 together - it doesn't matter that some will die.\" </p> <p>Animal behaviourist Professor David McFarland has recently joined the lab from Oxford University. He says: \"My main aim is to make self-sufficient robots that do real things in the real world. They'll get their energy from somewhere, they'll make decisions outside of human control, and they'll be able to travel in the ocean, in space, in nuclear reactors - all those places where people don't want to go.\" McFarland is working on an undersea robot project. These robots will shoal like fish: they will dive into the sea, communicate with each other, collect data on salinity, temperature, tidal currents, etc, and send their data back to researchers via satellites. He imagines they will get their energy from tidal currents. </p> <p>There is another way of making self-sufficient robots: these would actually ingest food just as animals do. For instance, the undersea robots might feed on plankton. Melhuish, McFarland and researcher Dr Ian Kelly are in the process of creating a Slugbot which will obtain its energy by eating slugs. This is the theory, but they admit progress is somewhat slow: the Slugbot has yet to take as much as a nibble out of a garden pest. </p> <p>A little further down the line of munching robots is the Gastrobot, created by Dr Stuart Wilkinson from the University of South Florida, Tampa. His robots convert carbohydrates found in food into an electrical form.

      "bodyText": "In the 1940s Dr. William Grey Walter built some of the first artificial animals. More than half a century later, these first robots are providing the inspiration for a new race of mechanical creatures. Walter called his machines tortoises, after the tortoise in Alice in Wonderland. The mock turtle explains to Alice that \"we went to school in the sea. The Master was an old turtle, we used to call him Tortoise.\" Alice interrupts to ask why he called him tortoise if he wasn't one. \"We called him tortoise because he taught us,\" replies the mock turtle angrily. Walter was one of the most distinguished neurophysiologists of his day. He developed these robot tortoises to help him understand how the brain functions. The first two, Elmer and Elsie, were cannibalised to create another six tortoises with the help of his technician, \"Bunny\" Warren. Two were destroyed in a house fire in Australia, others were turned into scrap metal, or lost in transit between museums; fortunately one, possibly two, survived. Before his death, Walter passed a tortoise on to his son Nicholas, who kept it safe until Brunel University decided to repair it and use it for an exhibition in 1985. Some time later, Nicholas Walter discovered that it was about to be thrown out and rescued it; the last tortoise languished in his basement in Islington until 1995. Then Owen Holland, from the University of the West of England, restored it to Bristol where Walter lived and worked. Holland, senior technician Ian Horsfield, and Bunny Warren, restored the turtle to working order and have built replicas. What Walter's tortoise did was travel towards a light. He called the creature Machina speculatrix because, \"it explores its environment actively, persistently, systematically, as most animals do\". Most of the time the robot behaved as expected, but when put in front of a mirror, it began \"flickering, twittering and jigging like a clumsy narcissus,\" wrote Walter. He argued that this behaviour was evidence of self-awareness. Most scientists today do not believe robots can show self-awareness, but as Holland says, \"Walter wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells produces very rich behaviour.\" Few of Walter's theories about neurophysiology and the brain are respected today, but his work on the artificial animals has taken on new life. Even more importantly, the tortoises helped scientists to realise that complex behaviour can be generated by using just a few components, and that biological principles can be applied to the field of robotics. These lessons have been taken to heart by the intelligent autonomous systems laboratory at the University of the West of England where a replica of Walter's tortoise is housed in its original hutch. The first thing one sees when one walks into the robotics laboratory, is a large arena full of robots bumbling around, carrying out seemingly purposeless tasks. These U-bots, as they're called, have no eyes, they can't count, they don't know who they are, and they're not aware of anyone or anything else, yet they manage to sort coloured plates into piles of the correct colour. It takes them hours, but they get there in the end. They are an example of an intelligent robot according to Dr Chris Melhuish, a director of the lab. They are \"doing the right thing an adequate amount of times,\" he says, which is his current definition of intelligence. Strangely, for the director of a robotics department, he doesn't seem to know what a robot is. The definition he eventually settles on is that robots are \"a collection of technologies, probably mobile, hopefully autonomous, capable of acting on the environment in a seemingly goal oriented way.\" By trial and error, Melhuish and his team came up with four very simple rules which enabled the U-bots to carry out their task adequately. According to him, the robots behave like ants. \"Ants are a miracle of evolution and engineering,\" he says. \"An individual isn't very sophisticated and isn't capable of doing very much on its own, but put 20 million army ants together and watch out! They're capable of work scheduling, seeking their own energy, building homes and looking after the brood. They carry out everything that goes on in a city, and yet no single ant has the blue-print for their workload.\" In Antz, the movie, the queen constantly issued instructions, but this is not what happens in an ant colony. \"Ant colonies are actually examples of a wonderful de- centralised intelligence,\" says Melhuish, \"without consciousness and self-awareness. They are our inspiration.\" The lab also houses a small group of robots; Jason Welsby, the PhD student who created them, was inspired, not by ants, but by birds. The robots themselves look neither like birds nor even vaguely like robots. Called Blimps, they're small helium balloons with propellers and a battery slung beneath. They float in small silver flocks round the lab. Each one uses ultrasound to determine how far away the floor and the ceiling are. They keep track of each other with infrared transmitters and receivers and they follow three very simple rules: (1) Keep together; (2) Head in the same general direction and (3) Don't stay too close to other individuals. It sounds like a motto for the office. \"The hardware is not particularly useful because it's very vulnerable. The robots can't travel outside,\" says Welsby, \"but the software could be useful.\" He envisages more robust robots being sent to disaster areas to sweep paths looking for survivors. He adds: \"They could also be used in space exploration. You could send 50 together - it doesn't matter that some will die.\" Animal behaviourist Professor David McFarland has recently joined the lab from Oxford University. He says: \"My main aim is to make self-sufficient robots that do real things in the real world. They'll get their energy from somewhere, they'll make decisions outside of human control, and they'll be able to travel in the ocean, in space, in nuclear reactors - all those places where people don't want to go.\" McFarland is working on an undersea robot project. These robots will shoal like fish: they will dive into the sea, communicate with each other, collect data on salinity, temperature, tidal currents, etc, and send their data back to researchers via satellites. He imagines they will get their energy from tidal currents. There is another way of making self-sufficient robots: these would actually ingest food just as animals do. For instance, the undersea robots might feed on plankton. Melhuish, McFarland and researcher Dr Ian Kelly are in the process of creating a Slugbot which will obtain its energy by eating slugs. This is the theory, but they admit progress is somewhat slow: the Slugbot has yet to take as much as a nibble out of a garden pest. A little further down the line of munching robots is the Gastrobot, created by Dr Stuart Wilkinson from the University of South Florida, Tampa. His robots convert carbohydrates found in food into an electrical form. They do this by exploiting the metabolising power of micro-organisms, such as bacteria or yeast. \"Bio-electro chemical processes are harnessed in a device called a microbial fuel cell containing selected microbes. Such a living battery can be made self- sustaining with just an input of food, water and air,\" says Wilkinson. However, like a small horse, the researchers have to feed it sugar lumps. \"What we're interested in is a robot predator,\" says Melhuish, \"robots that go out and find their own energy like wild animals.\" Eventually he and his team hope to create working flocks or shoals of robots, not particularly intelligent, but certainly \"small, cheap, cheerful, replenishable, mass produced and homogenous\". One of his ideas is to develop a type of electrically activated polymer, a substance that would act almost like muscle. Melhuish envisages teams of worm-like robots, cleaning out escalators for instance. In the dark they would burrow about randomly eating grime. If someone shone a light into the escalator's innards, they would move towards it where they could be relieved of their dirt, or thrown away while new creatures are added.",

The prime minister doggedly refused to plead guilty.</p> <p>So short is the time now available for reforming legislation that the speech read from the throne contained only 15 bills and four draft bills, which will not be enacted unless unexpected calamity forces Labour election strategists to postpone their bid for a second full term until October or - the 11th hour - spring 2002.</p> <p>But, if the speech itself contained no content that had not been heavily trailed in advance, Mr Blair did surprise some MPs - in boisterous election mood on both sides - by the contempt he showed for the Conservative leader and his advisers.</p> <p>\"Good jokes, lousy judgment,\" Mr Blair explained, in contrast to his own earnest appeal to the electorate to transcend narrow self-interest. With voter apathy and cynicism leaving ministers worried that their biggest enemy is stay-at-home voters - not the Tories - Mr Blair set out what aides call chapter four of Labour's campaign \"narrative\" and coupled it with an appeal for responsibility.</p> <p>After putting the economy on a stable path, tackling hard-core unemployment via Gordon Brown's welfare-to-work schemes and what he called \"mending our schools\", this fourth Queen's speech package was about crime and health: five bills on everything from car crime to social security fraud, plus a wide-ranging health and social care bill to implement last summer' s ambitious NHS plan.</p> <p>In his keynote message Mr Blair told MPs: \"Across all these areas there is a clear narrative to what we have achieved. Laying the foundations of economic stability, getting people off welfare and into work, investing in public services, all of it designed to build opportunity.</p> <p>\"What this Queen's speech does is then, in return for that opportunity, [demand] responsibility. We are giving the police the powers they need, and we are giving the people the support they need to win back their communities,\" he claimed.</p> <p>To Mr Hague, in a long but witty speech, that was simply more hot air. In a crucial counterblast, later hammered home by the shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe, he complained: \"Police numbers have been cut, offences are up and 20,000 criminals have been realised early to offend again.\"</p> <p>\"Without adequate police numbers all this will come to nothing,\" the shadow home secretary predicted on Channel 4 as ministers spoke of community involvement in fighting crime and antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>The Conservative leader accused Mr Blair personally of routinely abandoning everything he has claimed to believe in over 20 years in public life and said that the government's executive arrogance was responsible for \"the least considered legislation in the history of the country\". NHS waiting lists, transport \"chaos\" and the storm clouds over this weekend's EU summit in Nice all provided Mr Hague with targets. \"It is designed to produce better headlines, not better public services,\" he said of yesterday's package.</p> <p>But his failure to address seriously either the economy or alternative Tory policies allowed Mr Blair to puncture him without much difficulty. Mocking Mr Hague's tax-and-spend package he quipped: \"If they want to save \u00a31 bn on fraud they should start with their own programme.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair rattled off details of the Conservative legacy after 18 years in power - from \"cock-eyed\" rail privatisation to 15% mortgages and leaking school roofs - and predicted: \"We will not forget. More important, neither will the country.\"</p> <p>Focus group findings and opinion polls, which have seen Labour bounce back to a 10% lead - according to an ICMGuardian survey last week - after the Tory bounce during the fuel crisis, suggest he is right. Labour and Tory MPs are starting to wonder if Mr Blair may increase his 179-seat majority in 1997.</p> <p>While Tory MPs on both left and right brace themselves for a second hammering at the polls, Labour strategists are puzzled by Mr Hague's failure to make a serious impact on public opinion. \"His combination of 19th parliamentarian and 21st century management consultant should have been ideal,\" conceded one. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/pollreviews.htm\" target=\"_new\">Latest ICM polls</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Official British monarchy website</a> <br><a href=\"http://members.tripod.co.uk/moveagainstmon\" target=\"_new\">Movement Against the Monarchy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.worldfreeinternet.net/parliament/settlement.htm?\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the Act (from American parliament campaign)</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday defended his government's legislative programme from accusations of blatant electioneering by challenging voters to demonstrate the \"individual responsibility\" needed to make Labour's vision of the good society become a reality. During brutal exchanges across the Commons dispatch box after the ritual pomp and flummery of the annual Queen's speech ceremonies, both the prime minister and William Hague provided abundantly clear outlines of the campaigns they plan to run once the date of the coming general election is fixed - probably for May 3. The government's emphasis on fighting \"yob culture\" - notably public drunkenness - on NHS reforms, and another attack on welfare fraud, prompted an immediate charge that ministers are obsessed with \"clearing the decks\", their eyes fixed firmly on the Middle England segment of Labour's winning 1997 coalition of voters. The Conservative leader, who repeatedly accused Mr Blair of being \"all spin and no delivery\" and wasting \u00a325bn worth of extra taxes, joked that it was \"very good of her majesty to come down here and deliver\" her speech, considering how \"thin\" it was. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, echoed Mr Hague's complaint that the speech was \"unambitious\" in terms of the most urgent problems facing voters - crumbling schools, hospitals, transport and police services. The prime minister doggedly refused to plead guilty. So short is the time now available for reforming legislation that the speech read from the throne contained only 15 bills and four draft bills, which will not be enacted unless unexpected calamity forces Labour election strategists to postpone their bid for a second full term until October or - the 11th hour - spring 2002. But, if the speech itself contained no content that had not been heavily trailed in advance, Mr Blair did surprise some MPs - in boisterous election mood on both sides - by the contempt he showed for the Conservative leader and his advisers. \"Good jokes, lousy judgment,\" Mr Blair explained, in contrast to his own earnest appeal to the electorate to transcend narrow self-interest. With voter apathy and cynicism leaving ministers worried that their biggest enemy is stay-at-home voters - not the Tories - Mr Blair set out what aides call chapter four of Labour's campaign \"narrative\" and coupled it with an appeal for responsibility. After putting the economy on a stable path, tackling hard-core unemployment via Gordon Brown's welfare-to-work schemes and what he called \"mending our schools\", this fourth Queen's speech package was about crime and health: five bills on everything from car crime to social security fraud, plus a wide-ranging health and social care bill to implement last summer' s ambitious NHS plan. In his keynote message Mr Blair told MPs: \"Across all these areas there is a clear narrative to what we have achieved. Laying the foundations of economic stability, getting people off welfare and into work, investing in public services, all of it designed to build opportunity. \"What this Queen's speech does is then, in return for that opportunity, [demand] responsibility. We are giving the police the powers they need, and we are giving the people the support they need to win back their communities,\" he claimed. To Mr Hague, in a long but witty speech, that was simply more hot air. In a crucial counterblast, later hammered home by the shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe, he complained: \"Police numbers have been cut, offences are up and 20,000 criminals have been realised early to offend again.\" \"Without adequate police numbers all this will come to nothing,\" the shadow home secretary predicted on Channel 4 as ministers spoke of community involvement in fighting crime and antisocial behaviour. The Conservative leader accused Mr Blair personally of routinely abandoning everything he has claimed to believe in over 20 years in public life and said that the government's executive arrogance was responsible for \"the least considered legislation in the history of the country\". NHS waiting lists, transport \"chaos\" and the storm clouds over this weekend's EU summit in Nice all provided Mr Hague with targets. \"It is designed to produce better headlines, not better public services,\" he said of yesterday's package. But his failure to address seriously either the economy or alternative Tory policies allowed Mr Blair to puncture him without much difficulty. Mocking Mr Hague's tax-and-spend package he quipped: \"If they want to save \u00a31 bn on fraud they should start with their own programme.\" Mr Blair rattled off details of the Conservative legacy after 18 years in power - from \"cock-eyed\" rail privatisation to 15% mortgages and leaking school roofs - and predicted: \"We will not forget. More important, neither will the country.\" Focus group findings and opinion polls, which have seen Labour bounce back to a 10% lead - according to an ICMGuardian survey last week - after the Tory bounce during the fuel crisis, suggest he is right. Labour and Tory MPs are starting to wonder if Mr Blair may increase his 179-seat majority in 1997. While Tory MPs on both left and right brace themselves for a second hammering at the polls, Labour strategists are puzzled by Mr Hague's failure to make a serious impact on public opinion. \"His combination of 19th parliamentarian and 21st century management consultant should have been ideal,\" conceded one.

That could in turn pave the way to the first black archbishop - there is at least one potential candidate from withing the Church of England - though not the first woman as the church, unlike some Anglican congregations overseas, has not yet got round to appointing female bishops. The proposals were outlined yesterday in a consultation paper drawn up by a committee headed by the Conservative former foreign secretary Lord Hurd, set up this year to review the Archbishop of Canterbury's workload and make recommendations about how it could be eased. Beside being Primate of All England, the archbishop is also diocesan bishop of Canterbury, metropolitan of the southern province of the Church of England and leader of the worldwide Anglican communion. Although previous archbishops have periodically considered reforming their role, the Hurd committee is the first systematic review. George Carey, the current incumbent, said: \"This document is a necessary first step along the road... it will be right to await the considered conclusions and recommendations in due course. \"I set up this review because I judged it was an opportune moment to take a measured look at the future development of the office of archbishop of Canterbury in a changing world.\" The consultation paper said that the church might consider reducing the archbishop's burden by delegating more responsibilities to other senior bishops such as London and Winchester or by splitting the two provinces of England into three more equal parts. Lord Hurd's committee is calling for responses from church members by the end of February and is due to firm up its recommendations in a final report next summer.",

If the leaders at Nice defer an issue as key as voting weights on the council of ministers, however, the summit will be open to the accusation that after much fanfare it ended with important matters unresolved, as did the Amsterdam summit in 1997. Downing Street is trying to portray itself almost as a bystander in an essentially Franco-German row over voting rights on the council of ministers, the senior body of political decision-makers from EU member states. The Germans are seeking more seats than the French on the council, on grounds of population. Paris regards this as a threat to the whole post-war Franco-German settlement. The Germans and the Italians are pressing for another round of reform in 2004. Downing Street believes a further inter-governmental conference - the rolling process through which structural reform is negotiated in the EU - can be used to project the British agenda of an end to further integration. In the short term, Mr Blair goes to what is being billed as potentially the longest and most difficult summit in the turbulent history of the EU determined to defend the British veto in key areas on which the council of ministers votes. He believes he can return home without having done political damage to him or Labour. Britain's prime minister will insist that any reform agenda after the Nice summit must be formulated in a way that does not delay the enlargement of the EU to formerly communist countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He will argue that further negotiations can start only once the likes of Poland have joined, though perhaps before their membership has passed the long ratification process. The British will resist demands by Germany, Italy and other integrationist-minded countries for the EU's charter of fundamental rights to be incorporated in a future treaty. The charter, watered down to remove significant social or economic rights after a long offensive spearheaded by Britain, is signed in Nice today. As thousands of banner-waving protesters converged on the Cote d'Azur, speculation mounted about a deal under which Germany and France would retain an equal number of votes in the council of ministers in return for agreement that a future inter-governmental conference will undertake more changes. Diplomats said it might be politically impossible for President Jacques Chirac to give Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der even a symbolic margin of votes in ministerial councils, despite Germany having added 20m people since reunification a decade ago. Mr Schr\u00f6der's key political aim in any new negotiations over changes to EU structures would be to put clear bound aries around EU institutional competences, so it is clear how power is distributed between the council of ministers, the nation-state and the region. The Nice summit is likely to go into the small hours of Sunday morning. No agreement is expected until the last minute on the three stickiest items: vote reweighting, the size of the European commission and extension of qualified majority voting. Writing in today's Guardian, Romano Prodi, president of the commission, insists he does not seek majority voting on tax in sensitive areas. \"I understand how sensitive taxation policy is some countries.

A safety bill is to be drafted which will take in the recommendations of Lord Cullen's inquiry into rail safety in the wake of the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. But the inquiry is not expected to report back until after the election - ensuring the bill cannot go through parliament before then and leading the Tories to accuse the government of missing an opportunity to crack on. The draft bill also aims to align controls on drug and alcohol use by cabin crew, air traffic controllers and shipping personnel with those in place on the railways and roads. Blood alcohol limits will be introduced for staff in civil aviation and shipping and police will be able to test those they suspect of drinking, as well as conducting tests for drugs. Police powers will also be extended so that on the roads they can test drivers they suspect of drug abuse. Increased penalties for road traffic offences are also promised, though the final details have not yet been worked out. On the seas and in harbours, the safety standards will be improved, while fire authorities will be able to recover costs when fighting fires on boats. The bill also aims to \"revitalise\" health and safety at work, bringing in more stringent penalties and ensuring public bodies are no longer exempt from being prosecuted if an accident occurs on their premises. Last night, the proposed bill was welcomed by the Rail Maritime and Transport union, while the train drivers' union Aslef stressed it hoped it would include provision for the widespread introduction of the automatic train protection system.

But we are not saying now.\" Buckingham Palace reacted diplomatically yesterday, noting that the Queen had had a busy day, with the state opening of parliament in the morning and a function at the British Museum in the evening. But a source at the palace, asked if the Queen had read the Guardian, replied: \"Everybody here has read it.\" Stressing that the Queen was a constitutional monarch, a spokesman said: \"A lot of points made are not actually for Buckingham Palace to answer but are for the government and other organisations to consider.\" By other organisations, the Palace meant the Church of England. He added: \"Buckingham Palace will follow this debate with interest.\" The Scottish National party put down a motion in the Scottish parliament yesterday expressing regret that Westminster had not followed Holyrood's lead last December in calling for removal of \"institutionalised discrimination\". Mike Russell, an SNP member of the Scottish parliament, said: \"The time for talk on this matter is surely over, and the time for action is now.\" In the Commons, as MPs were summoned by Black Rod to hear the Queen deliver her speech in the Lords, Dennis Skinner, the Labour left-winger, quipped: \"Tell her to read the Guardian.\" Another Labour MP, Norman Godman, a mainstream Labour MP who is a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said he was likely to sign today's motion. There was no place for discrimination: \"It needs a vigorous assault or the government will meander along with a system that is out of kilter with the 21st century.\" The Liberal Democrats' leader, Charles Kennedy, came out in support of change. The Conservatives, while reluctant to be seen as backing the act, suggested it would be best to leave things alone. But the party's view is far from unanimous. The debate created as much of a dilemma for the right-wing, monarchy-supporting media as it did in the Conservative party. The editor of the Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore, a strong royalist, said on the BBC World Service when asked to justify legislation that allowed only Protestants to be the monarch, he did not feel any offence, even though he was a Catholic. He saw the issue as Church of England reform. In sign of the muddle that the issue has created, he said: \"I think that a Catholic or a Jew or a Muslim could, in fact, be the supreme commander of the Church of England.\" The Archbishop of Canterbury's press secretary said: \"We are very aware of the human rights issue, but that is by no means the only factor.\" The editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, last night wrote to the attorney general challenging him to prosecute him under the Treason Felony Act of 1848 for supporting a republican government.

He is also entitled to free accommodation, a car, a chauffeur, a bodyguard and two secretaries.</p> <p><b> United States</b></p> <p>The President of the United States is elected every four years and can serve for two terms. His chief duty is to protect the constitution, enforce the laws made by Congress, and head the armed forces. Presidents can recommend legislation, call special sessions of Congress, veto bills, appoint federal judges, heads of federal departments, and ambassadors, conduct official business with foreign countries and grant pardons for offences against the US.</p> <p>The current salary is \u00a3147,000 a year (fixed since 1969), plus up to \u00a337,000 for expenses and \u00a373,500, tax-free, for travel and official entertainment. Proposals to double presidential pay from next year were recently thrown out by Congress.</p> <p>When he leaves office in January, Mr Clinton will draw an annual pension of $151,800 (\u00a3111,617) plus a similar amount for staff. Mrs Clinton will receive a pension of $20,000 (\u00a314,705).</p> <p><b> Japan</b></p> <p>The emperor has no powers related to government and po litical activity is forbidden: though he appoints the prime minister and chief justice, they are first designated by the Diet (parliament) and the cabinet. Only members of the imperial family retain princely titles - Emperor Akihito's sisters, daughters of Hirohito, no longer have titles.</p> <p>The emperor lives in a walled, moated 62-room palace, rebuilt in 1968, with 285 acres of grounds in the middle of Tokyo. There are 1,150 imperial employees costing \u00a3142m a year. An annual tax-free salary of \u00a31,764,705 also pays for some personal staff members and the living expenses for the empress and their immediate family.</p> <p><b> Denmark</b></p> <p>In a monarchy modelled on British lines, the popular Queen Margrethe II has weekly briefings from the prime minister and foreign minister and is required to sign all legislation, which is only valid if counter-signed by a minister.</p> <p>The royal family has a small palace, the Amalienborg, in the middle of Copenhagen, and a larger palace for official duties - the Christiansborg - elsewhere in the city. They also have a palace at Marselisborg near Arhus and often spend winter at the Fredensborg Palace.</p> <p><b> Spain</b></p> <p>The Spanish monarchy conforms to standard rules these days in having the King Juan Carlos I as head of state but not politically involved. The constitution says he \"arbitrates and moderates the regular working of the institutions, assumes the highest representation of the Spanish state in international relations ... and performs the functions expressly conferred on him by the constitution and the law.\"</p> <p>The royal family has the use of eight palaces, mostly in and around Madrid - though there's also one on Majorca and one in the Canaries.</p> <p><b> Belgium</b></p> <p>King Albert II's income is index-linked to a civil service list. The family has a formal palace in the middle of Brussels and a more modest Victorian mansion where they live a few miles away in the suburbs at Laeken.</p> <p>The Belgian monarch has wide powers. Although on succession he must be approved by parliament, the king has the nominal right to nominate the government and to dissolve parliament.</p> <p>He signs all laws and is responsible for executing them. No action of the monarch has any consequence, however, without a ministerial counter-signature. <br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/pollreviews.htm\" target=\"_new\">Latest ICM polls</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Official British monarchy website</a> <br><a href=\"http://members.tripod.co.uk/moveagainstmon\" target=\"_new\">Movement Against the Monarchy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.worldfreeinternet.net/parliament/settlement.htm?\" target=\"_new\">Full text of the Act (from American parliament campaign)</a></p>",

His chief duty is to protect the constitution, enforce the laws made by Congress, and head the armed forces. Presidents can recommend legislation, call special sessions of Congress, veto bills, appoint federal judges, heads of federal departments, and ambassadors, conduct official business with foreign countries and grant pardons for offences against the US. The current salary is \u00a3147,000 a year (fixed since 1969), plus up to \u00a337,000 for expenses and \u00a373,500, tax-free, for travel and official entertainment. Proposals to double presidential pay from next year were recently thrown out by Congress. When he leaves office in January, Mr Clinton will draw an annual pension of $151,800 (\u00a3111,617) plus a similar amount for staff. Mrs Clinton will receive a pension of $20,000 (\u00a314,705). Japan The emperor has no powers related to government and po litical activity is forbidden: though he appoints the prime minister and chief justice, they are first designated by the Diet (parliament) and the cabinet. Only members of the imperial family retain princely titles - Emperor Akihito's sisters, daughters of Hirohito, no longer have titles. The emperor lives in a walled, moated 62-room palace, rebuilt in 1968, with 285 acres of grounds in the middle of Tokyo. There are 1,150 imperial employees costing \u00a3142m a year. An annual tax-free salary of \u00a31,764,705 also pays for some personal staff members and the living expenses for the empress and their immediate family. Denmark In a monarchy modelled on British lines, the popular Queen Margrethe II has weekly briefings from the prime minister and foreign minister and is required to sign all legislation, which is only valid if counter-signed by a minister. The royal family has a small palace, the Amalienborg, in the middle of Copenhagen, and a larger palace for official duties - the Christiansborg - elsewhere in the city. They also have a palace at Marselisborg near Arhus and often spend winter at the Fredensborg Palace. Spain The Spanish monarchy conforms to standard rules these days in having the King Juan Carlos I as head of state but not politically involved. The constitution says he \"arbitrates and moderates the regular working of the institutions, assumes the highest representation of the Spanish state in international relations ... and performs the functions expressly conferred on him by the constitution and the law.\" The royal family has the use of eight palaces, mostly in and around Madrid - though there's also one on Majorca and one in the Canaries. Belgium King Albert II's income is index-linked to a civil service list. The family has a formal palace in the middle of Brussels and a more modest Victorian mansion where they live a few miles away in the suburbs at Laeken. The Belgian monarch has wide powers. Although on succession he must be approved by parliament, the king has the nominal right to nominate the government and to dissolve parliament. He signs all laws and is responsible for executing them. No action of the monarch has any consequence, however, without a ministerial counter-signature.

      "bodyText": "Fears of a fresh outbreak of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland were growing last night after two men were shot dead and another was seriously injured in Belfast in the space of 24 hours. A Catholic workman was gunned down as he carried out building work on the predominantly loyalist Monkstown estate on the northern outskirts of Belfast just before 4pm yesterday. A few minutes later a Catholic taxi driver was shot and seriously injured outside the depot where he worked on the Old Park Road in north Belfast. The killings followed the shooting of a Protestant taxi driver, Trevor Kell, just before midnight on Tuesday as he sat in his cab waiting for what appears to have been a bogus fare. Superintendent Campbell Dixon, the man in charge of the Monkstown investigation, described the attack as \"a naked sectarian murder carried out by loyalist paramilitaries\" He said the 30-year-old man, from the Dungiven area of Co Londonderry, was approached by two men and shot several times in the head and body. He died instantly. The killers made off on foot through the housing estate. The man injured in the Old Park shooting was shot outside a taxi office by a gunman on the pillion seat of a motorcycle. The RUC said the bike nearly collided with a car as it sped off. Gerry Kelly, the Sinn Fein assembly member for Belfast North, said the shooting had \"all the hallmarks of a loyalist attack on Catholics\". He said the victim was sitting in a car outside a taxi firm just on the Catholic side of the interface with the loyalist area when he was shot. Earlier yesterday detectives investigating the murder of Mr Kell said they did not believe the shooting had a sectarian motive. However loyalist paramilitaries banded together to investigate the murder. They said they were convinced his death had nothing to do with the feud between the groups which has claimed seven lives since August. In a statement the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando said: \"The three major loyalist paramilitary organisations are investigating the tragic death of Trevor Kell. \"We are convinced that Mr Kell's death has nothing to do with the so-called loyalist feud. \"Acts between the three groups are at an advanced stage and the hope is that there will be an early resolution to our differences.\" Alban Maginness, SDLP assembly member for the area, said the attacks must be \"unreservedly condemned\". \"No one is the winner at the end of the day and the real losers are the people of north Belfast and the families of those who have lost their lives. \"As a society in Northern Ireland we must leave this barbarism behind us.\" The Democratic Unionist assembly member for north Belfast, Nigel Dodds, said the spate of shootings and killings in the area marked a \"terrible deterioration\" in the security situation. He said that those who have been demanding a reduction in security cover and the emasculation of the RUC \"can now see the foolishness of their calls\". Mr Kell's widow, Margaret, said her husband, who had only started working full time for the taxi firm on Monday night, was an innocent man and she did not know why he had been targeted. \"The ones who did this are scum.

The doctors involved in the children's care are also interviewed. </p> <p>The programme has caused controversy because Granada TV agreed to pay the parents, from the Mediterranean island of Gozo, about \u00a3150,000 for the interview. The broadcaster pointed out that the money will go into a trust fund for Jodie's care, but pro-life groups have branded the payment unethical. </p> <p>In the hour-long documentary Mr and Mrs Attard say they were devastated at the death of Mary, who depended upon Jodie's heart and lungs for life. \"Even though we were prepared, it was a shock. We didn't accept that it was going to happen. Sometimes you just can't believe that she is dead, but you have to accept that she is,\" Mr Attard says. </p> <p>Mrs Attard, 29, tells the interviewer, Martin Bashir, how she held Mary after the operation on November 6. \"I wanted to see her straight away. I lifted her and I cuddled her. She was dead, but I was happy that I was holding her.\" Her husband, who is 44, adds: \"It was good to hold her. It was the first time we could cuddle her. Although she was dead, she was free at that time.\" </p> <p>The twins were born on August 8 at St Mary's hospital in Manchester. Doctors told the couple that if their children were not separated, both would die. If a separation was successful, Jodie could survive. Mr and Mrs Attard, who are Roman Catholics refused to give permission for the operation. They could not give their consent to an act that would kill one of their children, and wanted God's will to take its course instead. </p> <p>Doctors, wishing to save Jodie, went to the high court to overrule the parents' wishes. A judge said the operation should go ahead, and three appeal judges - who heard representations from the Catholic church and the ProLife Alliance - later agreed. Eventually, the parents gave up their legal fight. </p> <p>During the case, a court order had prevented the media from revealing the identity of the parents and their children. For the interview to go ahead, Mr and Mrs Attard had to ask for the order to be revised. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the family division at the high court in London, agreed yesterday that they could be identified, along with the doctors involved. But a ban on approaching the hospital where the operation took place remains in force, as does the injunction which protects the identity of Jodie. </p> <p>In tonight's programme, to be screened at 10pm, Mrs Attard says that Jodie has been progressing well since the separation. \"Although she was full of pipes and monitors and tubes ... she did not seem as if she was coming out from such a major operation. She looked settled. </p> <p>\"When we saw her for those two days [after the operation] she didn't smile and we were afraid something might have happened. But when they stopped the morphine she was back to normal again so we were very happy.\" </p> <p>Three doctors, Adrian Bianchi, Mike Maresh and Alan Dickson, also appear in the documentary. They say the Jodie is making good progress. </p> <p>Mrs Attard describes her feelings at being able to be close to Jodie. \"She started holding our hands. She might notice that something has been separated from her so she's holding our hands much, much stronger. </p> <p>\"We are very happy because she likes to try to talk with us and she smiles at people and us.

That, too, was carried out by Martin Bashir, who came to prominence when he interviewed with Princess Diana for BBC's Panorama. </p> <p>Panorama is understood to have been in discussions with the twins' parents, and offered a similar sum. </p> <p>Mr Attard tells Mr Bashir that the couple hope eventually to take their child back home to Gozo. \"We don't think too much ahead.

      "bodyText": "The government is to reintroduce a bill curbing the right to jury trial which has twice been thrown out by peers. The controversial Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill will abolish the right of some 18,000 defendants a year who are charged with one of a range of middle-ranking offences to choose between a jury trial and trial by magistrates. Under the bill, magistrates would take the decision whether to try the case themselves or send it to the crown court. The reintroduction of the bill was attacked yesterday by civil liberties groups, lawyers and the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe. John Wadham, director of Liberty, said the government was confusing being tough on crime with being tough on human rights. Ms Widdecombe said the re-introduction of the bill demonstrated the government's \"enormous arrogance\". She added: \"It has been dismissed twice and the government won't take the verdict of the democratic process. I hope it will now be thrown out again.\" Mr Wadham said: \"The right to jury trial is a crucial safeguard at the heart of our criminal justice system. Juries ensure that the criminal justice system is not dominated by professionals. Instead, ordinary people decide on guilt or innocence. \"The absence of sufficient numbers of magistrates from ethnic minorities also makes the cultural mix on most juries an important safeguard for black people who are often faced with courts who are otherwise made up entirely of white professionals.\" The Law Society said the plans to \"bulldoze through\" the Bill were wrong. Its president, Michael Napier, said: \"This Bill destroys the cornerstone of a fair justice system. \"Taking away the right to a trial by jury for certain offences risks increasing miscarriages of justice.\" He said there was no evidence the bill would speed up the court process or cut costs. The Home Office estimates the bill could save around \u00a3128 million, based on transferring around 14,000 cases currently heard in crown courts to magistrates. Last year, the number of cases where defendants chose jury trial rose by 2.6%. International criminal court A surprise element in the bill to introduce an international criminal court is expected to bring substantial changes to the present immunity enjoyed by diplomats. The court is to be established to try those accused of crimes against humanity. Twenty-three countries have so far ratified it and a total of 60 are needed for it to come into being. Britain is pushing ahead with the bill in spite of resistance from the US, which does not want its citizens to be subjected to an international court. It is expected to be established in about two years. The bill will enable the law-enforcement authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland to identify, arrest and transfer war crimes suspects to The Hague once the ICC is established. It will also give the domestic courts powers to try UK nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. Separate legislation for Scotland will be introduced in the Scottish Parliament. The bill is expected to be introduced in the Lords before Christmas. Save the Children and other organisations had expressed grave concern that diplomats involved in war crimes would be exempt. The government has since hinted that the bill will end that immunity. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"The international criminal court bill will enable us to achieve our target of becoming a founding member of the court and send a clear message to the world's tyrants that Britain wants them to face international justice.\" \"We took the lead in the negotiations to agree the treaty on the international criminal court.

Not only is it hosting the world premiere of Sam Shepard's play The Late Henry Moss, but the show brings together some of the biggest names in Hollywood. Shepard himself directs a cast that includes Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Unsurprisingly, the public has rushed to buy tickets for the five-week run; what is a revelation is how poor an evening awaits them. </p> <p>In one sense, The Late Henry Moss is a culmination of Shepard's playwriting. There are the warring siblings of True West, the hidden family secrets and wounds of Buried Child, the symbolism of A Lie of the Mind and the themes of the frontier's end, the damage fathers do to sons and all the macho-mythic desperation and attempted poeticism that exist in so many of his works. </p> <p>But Shepard doesn't enlarge these themes; he isn't exploring anything original or insightful. It's as if a college student completed an assignment to write in the style of the playwright. Shepard is half-heartedly cribbing from himself, and it makes for a very long evening. </p> <p>The show opens with a quiet, funny malevolence. After a preliminary tango across the stage by veteran character actor James Gammon (who plays Henry Moss) and Sheila Tousey (as his native American girlfriend, Conchala), we see Henry's son Earl (Nolte) sitting at a table in a New Mexico house, drinking bourbon and smoking while his younger brother, Ray (Penn), stands with his back to the audience, swinging a wrench, its clicking ratchet the only noise. He's gazing at a corpse wrapped in a sheet on a bed - their father. </p> <p>The brothers haven't seen each other in many years: Earl fled the family long ago after a drunken rampage in which Henry terrorised and battered his wife and broke the windows of their home. But there's something fishy in Earl's description of Henry's death. He tells Ray that Henry's neighbour, Esteban (Cheech Marin), had called him when Henry left the house in a taxi and didn't come back for a while. </p> <p>Earl flew in to discover Henry already dead. Esteban, later making his usual delivery of soup for Henry, unaware that he has died, supports Earl's story about the phone call, though it's clear he's covering something up for Earl. Esteban explains that Henry, who went and got drunk after receiving a cheque, called a taxi to take him and Conchala on a fishing trip. Ray subsequently interviews the cab driver (Harrelson), who relates a somewhat different narrative. </p> <p>There are several extended flashback sequences that get us to the \"truth\" of the matter. We watch Earl grapple with his guilt over abandoning his mother and brother, while Ray wrestles with his anger and sorrow. </p> <p>There are stretches of ironic, banal dialogue. (Ray to the cab driver: \"You're nothin'. Just like me.\" Henry to Earl: \"You know me, Earl - I was never one to live in the past.\") These are occasionally interrupted by desert-heartland poetry. (Earl to Ray: \"You jump all over him like a cold sweat.\" Earl to Esteban: \"I am nothing like the old man: We're as different as chalk and cheese.\") </p> <p>Plus, there's Conchala, Shepard's woman-myth character. In one flashback we find out that when she and Henry first met, in the jail drunk- tank, she pronounced Henry dead: \"Dead for 20 years, a dead man living in a dead house.\" Shepard's telling us that women define men, even holding the power of life and death over them. Henry and Conchala return from the fishing trip with one tiny, four-inch catch. Conchala strips down to a slip, takes a bath and puts the fish between her legs. It comes back to life; she puts it in her mouth and swallows it whole. Gosh! </p> <p>Nolte and Penn don't embarrass themselves, but the roles and dialogue limit them and prevent them from projecting. There's no sense of life, just generic abuse-survivor self-loathing and recrimination. Penn has a nice moment in the first act fighting back tears over his father's death, but you won't see it from the balcony. Nolte matches his bristly bourbon voice to Gammon's whisky growl, underlying their shared history. The secrets that get exposed are surprisingly anti-climactic, though; you get the Sturm und Drang of melodrama without the kick, and the brothers have nowhere to go, dramatically. </p> <p>Marin is funny for a time as the obsequious neighbour who cooked for Henry and sometimes borrowed his woman, but as the evening wears on, he starts to resemble the stereotypical Mexican cook in a western. Gammon, in the flashbacks, bellows all his lines at the same pitch, and his make-up, for some unfathomable reason, is smeared on like mud. </p> <p>In Shepard's direction of the play, you can see where compromises have been made. Characters who are not in a flashback sequence exit from the front of the stage, fully lit, violating the boundaries of theatrical space. Props and sets which are shifted during the various recollection scenes are dealt with awkwardly when the present-day action is returned to. The show is heavily amplified, but the voice levels shift depending on how close the actor is to one of the many mikes. </p> <p>There's also no real rhythm to the production, as if the actors worked on their parts separately and were thrown together only as the opening night approached. Shepard discordantly slapsticks around with two funeral-home attendants as if they were Keystone Kops - they sport black suits and sunglasses, peek out insanely from the bedroom curtain and drop the corpse on the floor. </p> <p>The one bright spot is Harrelson as the unnamed taxi driver. Saddled with the sometimes dangerous traits of being both hyper-friendly and a wimp (leading him to prolong relationships he should flee), Harrelson's cabbie is constantly in motion. His arms never hang at his side; his hands keep fluttering up as if he's afraid they might cause offence if they ever landed anywhere. He shifts from foot to foot, prattling on about his dreamland - the lucrative midnight pizza-delivery runs in Norman, Oklahoma, where every university-dorm door is opened by a Miss America student who wants to screw you. Throughout, Harrelson glows with an actor's love of his craft. </p> <p>Despite the press's excitement, The Late Henry Moss is no triumph. But Harrelson's funny, sexy performance gives off a heat not otherwise found in Shepard's dim desert tale.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first thing you wonder is, what's a 36-year-old man, shot down in a Tornado fighter, ejected at 200mph into the skies over Iraq, tortured by his captors, a true British war hero, doing in a place like this?</p> <p>We are in Hertfordshire, land of stud farms and signposts that all seem to end in either \"green\", \"pond\" or \"private\"; a Thunderbirds house, all plate glass and balconies, in a little village. A place where John Nichol makes a rather good living out of \"the most humiliating moment\" of his life.</p> <p>Although he chucked the airforce in 1994, Nichol is still the hunky-chunky military type. His fifth book, Decisive Measures (Mercenaries, diamonds and a bit of old-fashioned British loving in Sierra Leone) is just out. And next month he'll be all over the papers again, as the 10th anniversary of his greatest hour looms.</p> <p>On the back of his Boys' Own/Gulf war fame he has built a life as novelist, after-dinner corporate speaker and media pundit on things military: want to know about the Chinook disaster? Gulf war syndrome? How high pilots flew in Kosovo? Ask Nichol. And he is almost through a lucrative multi-book deal with Hodder and Stoughton.</p> <p>He once said that he owed it all to \"Some poor Iraqi conscript who probably got paid 10p a week with a missile that cost \u00a3750 on the black market shooting down my \u00a320m Tornado.\" But that's not quite it. Nichol is a man of enterprise. After being bound, beaten and burned, his torturer told him he was going to appear on TV as one of Saddam Hussein's hostages. He obediently combed his hair as instructed, then when he got the chance, ruffled it up so that he looked even more beaten up than he was.</p> <p>His books are a bit like him. They are stories about nice guys with names like Rudi and Jack. Decent men who get into big adventures around the world. More recently there are women in them. Is it difficult having to write sex into his books? \"It's the formula,\" says Nichol, \"the formula the publishers want.\"</p> <p>But his love scenes are gentle, written by the kind of guy who would worry about doing it right: \"A moment later she was in my arms. I pulled her closer and kissed her. She stiffened for a second, then leaned into me, holding my face in her hands, staring into my eyes.\"</p> <p>Nothing too revelatory, but it is the insider's knowledge of military matters that is more interesting in his books - the insights of the people who normally never talk, but seem delighted to talk to him.</p> <p>Decisive Measures has the advantage of the inside track. (\"I didn't go there myself. I thought it was marginally too dangerous.\") Instead he talked to those who had been there: military intelligence officers, mercenaries, SAS insiders. You can see how he carries it off. \"Hi, my name's John Nichol, you probably don't remember, but I was one of the Tornado crew shot down in Iraq during the Gulf war. Look, would you have a moment, I'm writing a book about . . .\" And wham, he has them eating out of his hand.</p> <p>On the after-dinner circuit he earns \u00a32,500 to \u00a35,000 for a one-hour presentation with a distinct feel of M People's \"'Reach For the Hero Inside Yourself\". BT has engaged him for another year to give corporate talks. Doesn't he find it boring? Giving the same speech about Iraq and the torture? Nichol cringes. \"I get well paid for it. It would be churlish to say I find it boring.\" But it is very clear he's been there. \"I can't speak about it in any kind of detail.\"</p> <p>It's not the torture that seems to bother him: \"Classic stuff, sleep deprivation, mindless beating, burning tissue paper stuffed down your neck,\" but the fact that he talked. \"I always hesitate to use the word torture. People have their fingernails cut out and hot irons shoved up their arse.\" So why didn't they do that to him? \"Probably because I gave in before they got there.\"</p> <p>They beat him up regularly, and badly. The worst part was listening to the screams down the corridor and knowing that he was next. \"I knew I would give in. I knew some stuff, like what target we were supposed to be hitting the next day, but nothing that mattered to anybody or would change the price of butter. I realised pretty quickly that the Iraqis weren't really sure what to ask us. They captured us, thought they should probably torture us, but to what end?

      "bodyText": "The first thing you wonder is, what's a 36-year-old man, shot down in a Tornado fighter, ejected at 200mph into the skies over Iraq, tortured by his captors, a true British war hero, doing in a place like this? We are in Hertfordshire, land of stud farms and signposts that all seem to end in either \"green\", \"pond\" or \"private\"; a Thunderbirds house, all plate glass and balconies, in a little village. A place where John Nichol makes a rather good living out of \"the most humiliating moment\" of his life. Although he chucked the airforce in 1994, Nichol is still the hunky-chunky military type. His fifth book, Decisive Measures (Mercenaries, diamonds and a bit of old-fashioned British loving in Sierra Leone) is just out. And next month he'll be all over the papers again, as the 10th anniversary of his greatest hour looms. On the back of his Boys' Own/Gulf war fame he has built a life as novelist, after-dinner corporate speaker and media pundit on things military: want to know about the Chinook disaster? Gulf war syndrome? How high pilots flew in Kosovo? Ask Nichol. And he is almost through a lucrative multi-book deal with Hodder and Stoughton. He once said that he owed it all to \"Some poor Iraqi conscript who probably got paid 10p a week with a missile that cost \u00a3750 on the black market shooting down my \u00a320m Tornado.\" But that's not quite it. Nichol is a man of enterprise. After being bound, beaten and burned, his torturer told him he was going to appear on TV as one of Saddam Hussein's hostages. He obediently combed his hair as instructed, then when he got the chance, ruffled it up so that he looked even more beaten up than he was. His books are a bit like him. They are stories about nice guys with names like Rudi and Jack. Decent men who get into big adventures around the world. More recently there are women in them. Is it difficult having to write sex into his books? \"It's the formula,\" says Nichol, \"the formula the publishers want.\" But his love scenes are gentle, written by the kind of guy who would worry about doing it right: \"A moment later she was in my arms. I pulled her closer and kissed her. She stiffened for a second, then leaned into me, holding my face in her hands, staring into my eyes.\" Nothing too revelatory, but it is the insider's knowledge of military matters that is more interesting in his books - the insights of the people who normally never talk, but seem delighted to talk to him. Decisive Measures has the advantage of the inside track. (\"I didn't go there myself. I thought it was marginally too dangerous.\") Instead he talked to those who had been there: military intelligence officers, mercenaries, SAS insiders. You can see how he carries it off. \"Hi, my name's John Nichol, you probably don't remember, but I was one of the Tornado crew shot down in Iraq during the Gulf war. Look, would you have a moment, I'm writing a book about . . .\" And wham, he has them eating out of his hand. On the after-dinner circuit he earns \u00a32,500 to \u00a35,000 for a one-hour presentation with a distinct feel of M People's \"'Reach For the Hero Inside Yourself\". BT has engaged him for another year to give corporate talks. Doesn't he find it boring? Giving the same speech about Iraq and the torture? Nichol cringes. \"I get well paid for it. It would be churlish to say I find it boring.\" But it is very clear he's been there. \"I can't speak about it in any kind of detail.\" It's not the torture that seems to bother him: \"Classic stuff, sleep deprivation, mindless beating, burning tissue paper stuffed down your neck,\" but the fact that he talked. \"I always hesitate to use the word torture. People have their fingernails cut out and hot irons shoved up their arse.\" So why didn't they do that to him? \"Probably because I gave in before they got there.\" They beat him up regularly, and badly. The worst part was listening to the screams down the corridor and knowing that he was next. \"I knew I would give in. I knew some stuff, like what target we were supposed to be hitting the next day, but nothing that mattered to anybody or would change the price of butter. I realised pretty quickly that the Iraqis weren't really sure what to ask us. They captured us, thought they should probably torture us, but to what end? It was important to try and hold out for a while. If you broke first they could lean on you really hard.\" So one day, facing beatings, burning newspaper down his back once again - and as electric shock treatment made its way down the corridor - he decided to tell them about the price of butter. One of the nice things about Nichol is his honesty (or could it be another marketing ploy - \"Nichol tells it how it is\"?). He has made a documentary, and campaigned with the fathers of the two pilots blamed for crashing a helicopter in the Mull of Kintyre in 1994, killing 29 people including top intelligence officers. Nichol believes the pilots will not be exonerated because the airforce he served for almost 20 years \"doesn't say sorry\". He left the airforce after Bosnia, because its role there had been \"a joke\". \"We were supposed to be monitoring the no-fly zone. But we were being ignored and were left flying around in circles watching helicopters landing and then villages burning and pretending it wasn't happening. Putting our lives at risk so the politicians back home could make it look like our men and women in Bosnia were doing something.\" On the subject of flying high, he doesn't support the view that if pilots had flown lower during the Kosovan war they wouldn't have hit and killed civilians: \"At 600 miles an hour it doesn't matter if you're flying at 30 feet or 30,000 feet - you can't see anything out the window anyway.\" The plans for a European army also get the refreshing Nichol treatment: \"All the pilots are chatting about it on the internet. It doesn't mean that much in the military, because we've already been flying alongside Dutch, French, American, whoever.\" This year, apart from the book, he has completed a series called Air-shows of the World; he has another TV series interviewing people about life-changing experiences; and three months ago he started on a 10th anniversary documentary, Going Back. It was dropped by the BBC, so he went back courtesy of the Daily Mirror. There is plenty of \"meeting with the enemy/we're just ordinary guys caught up in a lousy war\" stuff. He visited a prison but scrapped plans to revisit the jail where he was tortured. The experience proved to be too much for the man whose idea of therapy on his return from captivity was 15 pints and a chicken vindaloo. When I tentatively suggest we might hold this interview over until the 10th anniversary, I incur the clipped professional wrath of Nichol.

Instead, he found an international audience late in life, recording with other Buena Vista artists, and touring the world with their companion band, the Afro-Cuban All Stars. This September he sang with them at the Sydney Opera House, in October they toured Japan, and in November, just three weeks before his death, he gave his final show with the All Stars in Las Vegas.</p> <p>It was a fitting farewell for a man who had started his career singing in the brash Havana clubs, in the years before Castro's revolution. In 1945 he joined trumpeter Julio Cueva's Orchestra, one of the most popular bands in Cuba during the war years. Here he earned his lifelong nickname \"Puntillita\", from the song Son De La Puntillita, that he sang with the band. From the start, he was known as a singer who matched power, clarity and perfect intonation - qualities he retained throughout his career.</p> <p>In the 50s he was one of the soloists with the celebrated and long-established orchestra La Sonora Matancera, later made even more famous as the backing band for Celia Cruz, the \"Queen of Salsa\". \"Puntillita\" also sang alongside Cuba's greatest male singer, Beny Mor\u00e9, the bandleader known as \"the wizard of rhythm\" and the finest performer in Cuban history. Unlike Celia Cruz and others who left Cuba at the time of the revolution, seeking fame and fortune in the United States and elsewhere, \"Puntillita\" refused to become an exile, though his appearances were limited to Cuba and the communist world.</p> <p>It wasn't until the mid-90s that Cuban singer and band-leader Juan De Marcos Gonzalez, then the leader of the Sierra Maestra group, decided to try to revive the \"golden age\" of Cuban music of the 50s, and set out to discover how many of the former stars from that era were still living in Cuba, willing and able to keep playing and singing. \"Puntillita\" was one of those cheerfully coaxed back from retirement. He sang with De Marcos on the first album for his revivalist Afro-Cuban All Stars, A Todo Cuba Le Gusta, opening with Amor Verdadero - a song he performed with the All Stars on all their tours.</p> <p>He was also invited to take part in a second project, the massively successful Buena Vista Social Club Presents . . . , performing alongside Ry Cooder, who produced the set. On the Buena Vista album he sings with Ibrahim Ferrer and guitarist Eliades Ochoa on the bawdy El Cuarta De Tula and leads on La Bayamesa, a patriotic Cuban song from the mid-19th century.</p> <p>The sessions for both albums were recorded in just a few days in Havana in 1996, and have enjoyed quite extraordinary sales. Along with the subsequent solo albums by members of the Buena Vista team, they have now sold more than 7m copies worldwide, transforming the lives of all the elderly musicians involved, who were plucked from near-obscurity to enjoy four years of touring concert halls and festivals around the world.</p> <p>The Buena Vista project produced three veteran superstars, pianist Rub\u00e9n Gonzalez and singers Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, who all went on to record and tour as soloists. \"Puntillita\" Licea never had the chance to branch out like that, though he made further appearances on Ferrer's album, and on the second album by the Afro Cuban All Stars, entitled Distinto Diferente.</p> <p>His funeral in Havana was attended by members of the Afro-Cuban All Stars and the Buena Vista Social Club.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair yesterday defended his government's legislative programme from accusations of blatant electioneering by challenging voters to demonstrate the \"individual responsibility\" needed to make Labour's vision of the good society become a reality.</p> <p>During brutal exchanges across the Commons dispatch box after the ritual pomp and flummery of the annual Queen's speech ceremonies, both the prime minister and William Hague provided abundantly clear outlines of the campaigns they plan to run once the date of the coming general election is fixed - probably for May 3.</p> <p>The government's emphasis on fighting \"yob culture\" - notably public drunkenness - on NHS reforms, and another attack on welfare fraud, prompted an immediate charge that ministers are obsessed with \"clearing the decks\", their eyes fixed firmly on the Middle England segment of Labour's winning 1997 coalition of voters.</p> <p>The Conservative leader, who repeatedly accused Mr Blair of being \"all spin and no delivery\" and wasting \u00a325bn worth of extra taxes, joked that it was \"very good of her majesty to come down here and deliver\" her speech, considering how \"thin\" it was.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, echoed Mr Hague's complaint that the speech was \"unambitious\" in terms of the most urgent problems facing voters - crumbling schools, hospitals, transport and police services. The prime minister doggedly refused to plead guilty.</p> <p>So short is the time now available for reforming legislation that the speech read from the throne contained only 15 bills and four draft bills, which will not be enacted unless unexpected calamity forces Labour election strategists to postpone their bid for a second full term until October or - the 11th hour - spring 2002.</p> <p>But, if the speech itself contained no content that had not been heavily trailed in advance, Mr Blair did surprise some MPs - in boisterous election mood on both sides - by the contempt he showed for the Conservative leader and his advisers.</p> <p>\"Good jokes, lousy judgment,\" Mr Blair explained, in contrast to his own earnest appeal to the electorate to transcend narrow self-interest. With voter apathy and cynicism leaving ministers worried that their biggest enemy is stay-at-home voters - not the Tories - Mr Blair set out what aides call chapter four of Labour's campaign \"narrative\" and coupled it with an appeal for responsibility.</p> <p>After putting the economy on a stable path, tackling hard-core unemployment via Gordon Brown's welfare-to-work schemes and what he called \"mending our schools\", this fourth Queen's speech package was about crime and health: five bills on everything from car crime to social security fraud, plus a wide-ranging health and social care bill to implement last summer's ambitious NHS plan.</p> <p>In his keynote message Mr Blair told MPs: \"Across all these areas there is a clear narrative to what we have achieved. Laying the foundations of economic stability, getting people off welfare and into work, investing in public services, all of it designed to build opportunity.</p> <p>\"What this Queen's speech does is then, in return for that opportunity, [demand] responsibility. We are giving the police the powers they need, and we are giving the people the support they need to win back their communities,\" he claimed.</p> <p>To Mr Hague, in a long but witty speech, that was simply more hot air. In a crucial counterblast, later hammered home by the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, he complained: \"Police numbers have been cut, offences are up and 20,000 criminals have been released early to offend again.\"</p> <p>\"Without adequate police numbers all this will come to nothing,\" the shadow home secretary predicted on Channel 4 as ministers spoke of community involvement in fighting crime and antisocial behaviour.</p> <p>The Conservative leader accused Mr Blair personally of routinely abandoning everything he has claimed to believe in over 20 years in public life and said that the government's executive arrogance was responsible for \"the least considered legislation in the history of the country\". NHS waiting lists, transport \"chaos\" and the storm clouds over this weekend's EU summit in Nice all provided Mr Hague with targets. \"It is designed to produce better headlines, not better public services,\" he said of yesterday's package.</p> <p>But his failure to address seriously either the economy or alternative Tory policies allowed Mr Blair to puncture him without much difficulty. Mocking Mr Hague's tax-and-spend package he quipped: \"If they want to save \u00a31bn on fraud they should start with their own programme.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair rattled off details of the Conservative legacy after 18 years in power - from \"cockeyed\" rail privatisation to mortgage rates of 15% and leaking school roofs - and predicted: \"We will not forget. More important, neither will the country.\"</p> <p>Focus group findings and opinion polls, which have seen Labour bounce back to a 10% lead - according to an ICMGuardian survey last week - after the Tory bounce during the fuel crisis, suggest he is right. Labour and Tory MPs are starting to wonder if Mr Blair may increase his 179-seat majority in 1997.</p> <p>While Tory MPs on both left and right brace themselves for a second hammering at the polls, Labour strategists are puzzled by Mr Hague's failure to make a serious impact on public opinion. \"His combination of 19th parliamentarian and 21st century management consultant should have been ideal,\" conceded one.</p>",

The Conservative leader, who repeatedly accused Mr Blair of being \"all spin and no delivery\" and wasting \u00a325bn worth of extra taxes, joked that it was \"very good of her majesty to come down here and deliver\" her speech, considering how \"thin\" it was. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, echoed Mr Hague's complaint that the speech was \"unambitious\" in terms of the most urgent problems facing voters - crumbling schools, hospitals, transport and police services. The prime minister doggedly refused to plead guilty. So short is the time now available for reforming legislation that the speech read from the throne contained only 15 bills and four draft bills, which will not be enacted unless unexpected calamity forces Labour election strategists to postpone their bid for a second full term until October or - the 11th hour - spring 2002. But, if the speech itself contained no content that had not been heavily trailed in advance, Mr Blair did surprise some MPs - in boisterous election mood on both sides - by the contempt he showed for the Conservative leader and his advisers. \"Good jokes, lousy judgment,\" Mr Blair explained, in contrast to his own earnest appeal to the electorate to transcend narrow self-interest. With voter apathy and cynicism leaving ministers worried that their biggest enemy is stay-at-home voters - not the Tories - Mr Blair set out what aides call chapter four of Labour's campaign \"narrative\" and coupled it with an appeal for responsibility. After putting the economy on a stable path, tackling hard-core unemployment via Gordon Brown's welfare-to-work schemes and what he called \"mending our schools\", this fourth Queen's speech package was about crime and health: five bills on everything from car crime to social security fraud, plus a wide-ranging health and social care bill to implement last summer's ambitious NHS plan. In his keynote message Mr Blair told MPs: \"Across all these areas there is a clear narrative to what we have achieved. Laying the foundations of economic stability, getting people off welfare and into work, investing in public services, all of it designed to build opportunity. \"What this Queen's speech does is then, in return for that opportunity, [demand] responsibility. We are giving the police the powers they need, and we are giving the people the support they need to win back their communities,\" he claimed. To Mr Hague, in a long but witty speech, that was simply more hot air. In a crucial counterblast, later hammered home by the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, he complained: \"Police numbers have been cut, offences are up and 20,000 criminals have been released early to offend again.\" \"Without adequate police numbers all this will come to nothing,\" the shadow home secretary predicted on Channel 4 as ministers spoke of community involvement in fighting crime and antisocial behaviour. The Conservative leader accused Mr Blair personally of routinely abandoning everything he has claimed to believe in over 20 years in public life and said that the government's executive arrogance was responsible for \"the least considered legislation in the history of the country\". NHS waiting lists, transport \"chaos\" and the storm clouds over this weekend's EU summit in Nice all provided Mr Hague with targets. \"It is designed to produce better headlines, not better public services,\" he said of yesterday's package. But his failure to address seriously either the economy or alternative Tory policies allowed Mr Blair to puncture him without much difficulty. Mocking Mr Hague's tax-and-spend package he quipped: \"If they want to save \u00a31bn on fraud they should start with their own programme.\" Mr Blair rattled off details of the Conservative legacy after 18 years in power - from \"cockeyed\" rail privatisation to mortgage rates of 15% and leaking school roofs - and predicted: \"We will not forget. More important, neither will the country.\" Focus group findings and opinion polls, which have seen Labour bounce back to a 10% lead - according to an ICMGuardian survey last week - after the Tory bounce during the fuel crisis, suggest he is right. Labour and Tory MPs are starting to wonder if Mr Blair may increase his 179-seat majority in 1997. While Tory MPs on both left and right brace themselves for a second hammering at the polls, Labour strategists are puzzled by Mr Hague's failure to make a serious impact on public opinion. \"His combination of 19th parliamentarian and 21st century management consultant should have been ideal,\" conceded one.",

The decision to not to change marks the longest period of static interest rates in 10 years and, according to market commentators, is evidence of a slow-down in the British economy spurred by weak industrial production and a sluggish retail sector.

Every performance is finely grained, each gesture is made to count. As portrayed by Ian Storey, this Lieutenant Pinkerton - bourbon-swilling, physically dominating and aggressive enough actually to push Butterfly's uncle, the Bonze, away from the house when he renounces her - is not just unthinkingly impulsive and finally callous, but also cruelly cynical. Before his marriage to Butterfly he not only tells Sharpless (Jason Howard) that he will eventually take an American wife, but also shows him a picture, presumably of the woman he is already committed to. And when Butterfly's family gather for the wedding, half of them arrive in western clothes, indicating that she is not the first among them to become embroiled with American culture. </p> <p>The emotional ratchet is given further turns in the second act. Natalia Dercho's tiny, fragile Butterfly waits for Pinkerton's return in Miss Havisham style, wearing the dress he gave her on their wedding day. And as she drives out Goro the marriage broker, her son, astonishingly well played by Sam Aschavir, also attacks him - with his teddy bear. Goro himself (Peter Van Hulle) takes on a more usually sinister dimension; he even reappears with Pinkerton and his new American wife in the final scene, looking for yet another financial cut of the action. </p> <p>Musically, it is just as enthralling. Guido Ajmone-Marsan's conducting is robust, never over-sweet; an occasional rough patch apart, the orchestral playing is fervent. Both Dercho and Storey are first rate - she with seemingly boundless reserves of compelling, well-focused tone, he matching his burly physicality with singing of equal forcefulness - while Jane Irwin's Suzuki is beautifully modulated.

A more considered verdict might be that, as the play's author, he is also culpable of taking West End theatre back about 50 years by creating a cardboard courtroom drama. </p> <p>Agatha Christie, you might say, lives on, except she did trial drama better in Witness for the Prosecution: there was even an American 1920s play, Trial of Mary Dugan, with alternative endings depending on how a selected audience jury voted. Undeterred, Archer resuscitates an old form in which we are presented with conflicting evidence about the accused cardiac surgeon. Did he poison his wife with potassium chloride in order to claim her life insurance? Or is he being framed by a vindictive nurse with whom he may or may not have had an affair? Only those who desperately care need hasten to the Haymarket. </p> <p>It would take a Freudian analyst, however, to work out what Archer is really up to in this musty museum piece. On one level, the play is naked self-display: the accused is called Sherwood - and Sherwood Forest was famed for its archers - and is not only an heroic war veteran but is described as having \"a brilliant and subtle mind\". Yet the play also feels like a self-accusatory ritual: without giving the game away, one can reveal that if the fictional protagonist Archer plays had admitted to the lesser sin of adultery he might have escaped on the more serious charge. Make of that what you will. </p> <p>What one can say is that, as drama, the piece takes an age to get going and is full of plonking exit lines and musty forensic trickery. An illiterate porter, who has provided damning evidence for the prosecution, cries out: \"I only told them what you told me to say.\" And the credibility of the nurse hinges on the fact that she writes with her left hand while claiming to be dexterous. I had the sensation of watching a conjurer pulling some very dead rabbits out of some very old hats. </p> <p>The suspense, such as it is, rests on how Lord Archer will perform when it is his turn to act. To be fair, he inflicts cruel and unusual punishment on himself by being forced to witness his own play in virtual silence for the first two acts. But, in the third act, he takes the stand and delivers his lines with the over-rehearsed sing-song of a man apparently reading from an invisible autocue. Real acting is about creating a sense of spontaneity: Archer gives the impression he is studying to be an amateur. </p> <p>Michael Feast and Edward Petherbridge as the opposing counsels show how these things should be done by investing their ponderous lines with measured irony. But the clunkiness of Val May's production is symbolised by Old Bailey chimes that come in too early and by pieces falling off the set. By the end the audience collapsed into laughter not, I fear, in sympathy but in sheer disbelief at the solemn ineptitude of the spectacle they had witnessed. </p> <p> Until March 3.
