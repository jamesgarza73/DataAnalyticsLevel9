For more than a month, they have churned out their daily quota of opinion larded with the occasional fact.</p> <p>Now, some of them have clearly had enough. Will Durst of the <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com\" target=\"_new\">San Francisco Examiner</a>, for example, has an acid, witty, sidelong look at the process.</p> <p>Al Gore, he concedes, cannot be blamed for refusing to concede: \"This isn't a contest for junior high school hall monitor, this is for president of the United States of America. Leader of the free world.</p> <p>\"We're talking king of the planet here. Power. Domination. Babes. Think Leonardo DiCaprio with a nuclear football. Besides, it doesn't really matter who wins, they won't be able to govern.</p> <p>\"No mandate to speak of. Deadlocked senate. 'I don't have to listen to you. You're not the REAL president. You are not the boss of me'.</p> <p>\"Less effectual than a compass in an electro magnetic power plant.\"</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Washington Post</a>, columnist EJ Dionne indignantly examines the double standards of the Republicans:</p> <p>\"As I write, we await decisions from the Florida supreme court and the two absentee ballot cases. If the courts go against Gore, the pressure on him to quit will be enormous.</p> <p>\"As for Bush, he's above the courts, above the vote counts, above inconvenient questions about whether he really won the election.</p> <p>\"If the courts rule against Bush, he'll just keep going until January. Will anyone say a word? Heads Bush wins, tails Gore loses.\"</p> <p>Coming at it from the other side of the argument, Linda Chavez chucks a column of vitriol over the vice president in the <a href=\"http://www.chicago.tribune.com\" target=\"_new\">Chicago Tribune</a>.</p> <p>\"No one will ever convince Al Gore that he lost the election. If he had his way, no doubt he would personally count every one of the 6m votes cast in Florida to satisfy himself that he won after all.</p> <p>\"He has already hinted that he or his allies will file suit under Florida's freedom of information laws to do so.</p> <p>\"Let him believe what he wishes.

      "bodyText": "It is a golden mini-era for commentators and pundits. Every political nook and cranny has been explored, every angle covered. For more than a month, they have churned out their daily quota of opinion larded with the occasional fact. Now, some of them have clearly had enough. Will Durst of the San Francisco Examiner, for example, has an acid, witty, sidelong look at the process. Al Gore, he concedes, cannot be blamed for refusing to concede: \"This isn't a contest for junior high school hall monitor, this is for president of the United States of America. Leader of the free world. \"We're talking king of the planet here. Power. Domination. Babes. Think Leonardo DiCaprio with a nuclear football. Besides, it doesn't really matter who wins, they won't be able to govern. \"No mandate to speak of. Deadlocked senate. 'I don't have to listen to you. You're not the REAL president. You are not the boss of me'. \"Less effectual than a compass in an electro magnetic power plant.\" In the Washington Post, columnist EJ Dionne indignantly examines the double standards of the Republicans: \"As I write, we await decisions from the Florida supreme court and the two absentee ballot cases. If the courts go against Gore, the pressure on him to quit will be enormous. \"As for Bush, he's above the courts, above the vote counts, above inconvenient questions about whether he really won the election. \"If the courts rule against Bush, he'll just keep going until January. Will anyone say a word? Heads Bush wins, tails Gore loses.\" Coming at it from the other side of the argument, Linda Chavez chucks a column of vitriol over the vice president in the Chicago Tribune. \"No one will ever convince Al Gore that he lost the election. If he had his way, no doubt he would personally count every one of the 6m votes cast in Florida to satisfy himself that he won after all. \"He has already hinted that he or his allies will file suit under Florida's freedom of information laws to do so. \"Let him believe what he wishes. If he insists on deluding himself that he won, it will only make him an increasingly bitter and unhappy man. \"But the country should be allowed to move forward without the Gore legal team trying to block the way.\" The leader writer of the Miami Herald comes up with a vivid analogy. \"Like expectant parents, we must pace the waiting room knowing that nothing more can be added to the debate.\" The column goes on to undermine that opening premise, by arguing that, whatever the ruling of the state supreme court, there should be further action against the Republican activists who blatantly meddled with thousands of applications for postal votes. The Dallas Morning News points out the increasingly serious implications of the court cases for a smooth transition of power next month. It highlights the complex system of congressional approval for the new presidential cabinet members, and chides the Clinton administration for not doing more to help the rival candidates form their putative administrations. \"It would be foolhardy to predict the rulings in the various courts considering interrelated issues this week, but all sides should be moving with dispatch. \"This litigation must end. Soon. In the meantime, the Clinton administration should do more to help with transition. Now.\" The Boston Globe believes that, 30 days after the elections, both candidates should abide by the imminent decision of the Florida supreme court, and drop all other legal moves. \"The courts may never be able to provide a perfect outcome for what is so clearly an imperfect election. But they can confer a sense of fairness and propriety. \"Both candidates and all Americans should find a way to accept their verdict.\" At the heart of the legal action in the Florida state capital, the Tallahassee Democrat offers an interesting sidebar on the political junkies following the intricate arguments. Among them, it discovers a Briton in a bit of a pickle: \"Peter Spiegel of the Financial Times of London shivered in his blazer as he stood near the front of the line as he had since 6am. 'My hands don't work any more,' said the reporter, who is based in Washington DC. 'I didn't bring any warm clothes. I flew down originally to West Palm Beach (in early November) and I haven't been home since'.\"",

Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium all want to increase their voting power.</p> <p>But, however you look at it, the problem always comes back to that odd couple, France and Germany, the historical axis around which the European Community was founded back in 1957. Parity worked fine then, but since reunification, 82m Germans have had the same number of votes as 59m French citizens.</p> <p>So everyone in Nice is agog: will Chirac agree to give Gerhard Schr\u00f6der even a symbolic edge? According to one view, the issue has become so complex that France no longer considers a small concession on votes a taboo - if that is the only way to get an overall agreement on streamlining the EU\u00cds workings to prepare for enlargement.</p> <p>But others argue that it is politically impossible for the Gaullist president to do this. And anyway, Germany might be prepared to stick with parity in return for agreement on a new intergovernmental conference in 2004 to review future constitutional arrangements, vital for Berlin because of pressure from the provincial governments or L\u00e4nder.</p> <p>If the outcome turns out to be simpler reweighting, the large states would have 30 votes, with Germany getting a token one to three more to reflect its far larger population. If that happened, the broader spread would leave more room to differentiate between medium and smaller countries.</p> <p>Germany had originally supported a so-called double majority, in which any decision would need both a majority of country votes and a majority of the EU\u00cds 350m- plus population to pass.</p> <p>These issues are so complex that even veteran experts and euro-bores - and there are many here in Nice - have trouble following them. But the end result would be to ensure that France retained as much influence as possible while finally accepting Germany\u00cds post-unity status.</p> <p>While pushing for a more faithful reflection of its added stature, Schr\u00f6der has insisted the vote question is a \"political issue, not a mathematical one\". Intriguing stuff, though no one yet knows how it will all end.</p> <p>The only certainty is that by the small hours of Sunday morning, some solution will miraculously emerge. \"When you get to 11 or 12 o\u00cdclock at night on the last night, then suddenly everything that is not resolved becomes tradeable,\" said one veteran negotiator.</p> <p>And if all else fails, sleep deprivation and lack of other basic needs may do the trick: veterans of the 1997 Amsterdam summit remember one expedient that worked wonders in the last crucial stretch.

According to one view, the issue has become so complex that France no longer considers a small concession on votes a taboo - if that is the only way to get an overall agreement on streamlining the EU\u00cds workings to prepare for enlargement. But others argue that it is politically impossible for the Gaullist president to do this. And anyway, Germany might be prepared to stick with parity in return for agreement on a new intergovernmental conference in 2004 to review future constitutional arrangements, vital for Berlin because of pressure from the provincial governments or L\u00e4nder. If the outcome turns out to be simpler reweighting, the large states would have 30 votes, with Germany getting a token one to three more to reflect its far larger population. If that happened, the broader spread would leave more room to differentiate between medium and smaller countries. Germany had originally supported a so-called double majority, in which any decision would need both a majority of country votes and a majority of the EU\u00cds 350m- plus population to pass. These issues are so complex that even veteran experts and euro-bores - and there are many here in Nice - have trouble following them. But the end result would be to ensure that France retained as much influence as possible while finally accepting Germany\u00cds post-unity status. While pushing for a more faithful reflection of its added stature, Schr\u00f6der has insisted the vote question is a \"political issue, not a mathematical one\". Intriguing stuff, though no one yet knows how it will all end. The only certainty is that by the small hours of Sunday morning, some solution will miraculously emerge. \"When you get to 11 or 12 o\u00cdclock at night on the last night, then suddenly everything that is not resolved becomes tradeable,\" said one veteran negotiator. And if all else fails, sleep deprivation and lack of other basic needs may do the trick: veterans of the 1997 Amsterdam summit remember one expedient that worked wonders in the last crucial stretch. The caterers ran out of food and a deal swiftly followed.

On the other, it recognises the importance of government intervention to address persistent market failures concerning issues such as equity, redistribution and the internalisation of social and environmental costs.</p> <p>Commissioned and funded by Action Aid, CAFOD, the RSPB, UK Food Group (UKFG) and World Wildlife Fund, the following extract from the report pinpoints some of the key assumptions and battlegrounds behind the white paper.</p> <p><b>Globalisation - a fact of life?</b></p> <p>According to one department for international development (DIFD) official, \"Globalisation is an unstoppable process involving information technology and the globalisation of markets - globalisation is with us.\"</p> <p>While it is true that part of the globalisation process involves technological change (e.g. improved communications and transport technology) it is also clear that other globalisation processes, such as increasing international mergers and acquisitions, increasing fluidity of capital and increasing interdependence of markets are critically influenced by government policy. Whether or not globalisation is unstoppable is a moot point - but to control the way in which it shapes our lives lies within the power of governments.</p> <p><b>Should growth come before environmental protection?</b></p> <p>According to one DETR official: \"There is a respectable argument that states that countries have to reach a certain stage of development before they can seriously devote much in the way of resources to environmental protection.\"</p> <p>This statement suggests that growth is the path to environmental improvement. It does not, however, account for the interaction between growth and environmental degradation. Growth - as we currently measure it - has environmental implications as this necessarily entails increased consumption and resource use. The Government has recognised the consumption problem saying that, \"Most environmental degradation is underpinned by the consumption patterns of middle and upper income groups and the large, increasingly, globalised production system that meets and shapes their needs.\" This sits uneasily with advocacy of a growth leads to environmental improvement strategy.</p> <p>For example, UNEP figures estimate the number of motor vehicles per person in North America is 0.75, 30 times that of Africa (0.025 vehicles per capita). Coincidentally, North American per capita fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are among the highest in the world. If North American consumption levels were achieved worldwide, the total number of vehicles would reach some 4,500 million - a massive increase from the 676 million vehicles in 1996.</p> <p>The government needs to recognise that developed countries, despite efficiency improvements, have not reduced their absolute reliance on natural resources (merely their share in GDP), that their absolute consumption rate of such resources continues to increase, and that imported natural resources are crucial to industrialised economies.</p> <p><b>Trade liberalisation - to what end?</b></p> <p>According to one DFID official, \"Clare Short has identified trade liberalisation as beneficial and a fact of life.\" That said, some government documents, and indeed Clare Short, have indicated that liberalisation can adversely affect some people and that such people should be helped with appropriate safety nets.</p> <p>However, even the safety nets approach may not be an adequate response. Investment bank Salomon Smith Barney estimates that the concessions to reform China has made in bilateral deals negotiated with the USA, EU, Canada and Japan in order to join the world trade organisation could work out at the loss of some 40 million jobs, or 3% of China's population. This is the same, proportionately, as if the UK implemented economic reforms costing 1.85 million jobs. It is unlikely that a big enough safety net exists for this kind of massive social disruption.</p> <p>There is insufficient recognition in government thinking that, in some circumstances, the social and/or environmental adjustment costs of liberalisation may be too high. Rarely, if ever, does the government recognise that in some situations, liberalisation is simply the wrong policy or that effective social and environmental measures should be in place before liberalisation is pursued.</p> <p>On the impacts of trade on the environment, according to a ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food (MAFF) official, \"The answer lies not in preventing trade but in ensuring that mechanisms are in place to address externalities - trade is not a part of production therefore environmental degradation is not a part of trade - policy frameworks need to be in place to address externalities while generating trade.\"</p> <p>Trade does have one important direct environmental impact - the greenhouse gas emissions from freight transport that contributes to climate change. The social and environmental costs of international freight transport are currently not internalised into prices meaning that the cost of long distance transport is distorted. As the MAFF official mentions, addressing such externalities is important but the crucial issue is when and how.</p> <p>It is also important to recognise the interaction between trade liberalisation, increasing reliance on international markets, the desire to be competitive and the impact this can have on attempts to improve social and environmental standards.</p> <p>On trade, agriculture and development, the government largely promotes an approach in which all countries should liberalise to similar degrees. Yet, according to a DFID official, \"In some cases food security is best achieved by producing at home. In other cases by generating income so that food can be purchased. The challenge at the moment is dumping of Western produce. There are certain circumstances when national food self-sufficiency will be appropriate.\" This suggests that there may be cases where protecting domestic agriculture is an important and appropriate policy option. It does not sit well with the one-size-fits-all approach to liberalisation normally advocated.</p> <p><b>Growth, equity and redistribution</b></p> <p>A certain amount of confusion exists over how to address growth and equity. According to a DFID paper: \"Growth will depend on a continuation of market friendly policies which promote investment in the context of low inflation and effective macro-economic management. For many governments this will mean continued commitment to programmes of economic reform and market liberalisation.\"</p> <p>Economic growth through expanded trade and investment flows is seen as the best means of alleviating poverty and increasing welfare.</p> <p>This is tempered to some extent by a recognition that, according to one DFID official, \"Intervention is necessary to prevent anti-poor growth and to facilitate pro-poor growth.\" That said, the official goes on to state that, \"This should not be redistributionist since growth would then be inhibited - it should take the form of safety nets, etc. - assisting vulnerable groups to cope with trade policy change is important.\"</p> <p>The DFID document, on the other hand, states that \"More equal countries are able to convert a given level of growth into greater poverty reduction. There is also evidence that reduced inequality is good for growth.\" (DFID, International Development Target Strategy Paper on Economic Wellbeing).</p> <p>So where should the government stand on growth and equity? A range of research has shown that economic growth is just one aspect of poverty reduction and that underlying issues of access to resources, education, health care etc. are just as, if not more, important.</p> <p>One important policy measure identified in the report is land reform; an issue recognised by one DFID official who states that, \"There is beginning to be a realisation of the importance of agriculture in economic growth - this has not been on the agenda for the last ten years and is beginning to come back again. Agriculture is important not only for improving livelihoods of people in rural areas but also as an engine for economic growth. Agrarian reform is coming back on the agenda. It is present in the Economic Wellbeing paper and beginning to come back in World Bank discussions.\"</p> <p>The economic wellbeing paper mentioned above does indeed talk of land reform, stating that, \"Some direct measures are possible to improve income distribution, notably through land tenure reform and pro-poor public expenditure strategies.\" The paper goes on to say that, \"The thrust of the paper, however, is that, for long-term and sustainable poverty reduction, poor people must contribute more effectively to growth\" (DFID, International Development Target Strategy Paper on Economic Wellbeing). Such an emphasis results in a failure to put forward concrete policy proposals on redistributing assets (for example, promoting land reform) as well as redistributing opportunity.</p> <p>Past experience shows that land reform is unlikely to be successful without supporting policies to help poor, marginal farmers take advantage of it. The government should encourage such complementary measures.</p> <p><b>Who are the key influences?</b></p> <p>It is difficult to get a completely accurate picture on the range of influences on government thinking concerning globalisation issues. However, the research suggests that, from the UK, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), Institute for Development Studies (IDS) and International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) are influential. The World Bank and the World Resources Institute (WRI) are two of the most respected international institutions. According to one DFID official, \"The Dollar and Kraay paper [a World Bank document] on economic growth has been particularly influential recently.\"</p> <p>Notable by their absence are UN bodies such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Also seemingly absent are organisations and institutions from the developing world.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Government thinking on globalisation is characterised by contradictions. There is tension between a focus on free market and deregulatory policies and a focus on government intervention to promote more equitable and sustainable ways of improving the quality of life.</p> <p>In the past few years, there has been no shortage of calls for, and opportunities to implement, a new way of managing globalisation. UNDP, World Bank and UNEP reports have all called for a different approach from governments. The key test then, for the globalisation white paper, is where it will place its emphasis.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/research/growth/pdfiles/growthgoodforpoor.pdf \" target=\"_new\">The World Bank's Dollar and Kraay paper on growth</a><br><a href=\"http://www.oneworld.org/iied/\" target=\"_new\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a><br><a href=\"http://www.igc.org/wri/\" target=\"_new\">World Resources Institute</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Institute for Development Studies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Overseas Development Institute</a></p> <p><b>Notes</b></p> <p>The key texts employed as a basis for deriving principal assumptions underlying government thinking were: Eliminating World Poverty: A Challenge for the 21st Century (DFID, 1997); International Development Target Strategy Paper on Economic Well-being (DFID, 1999); Strategies for Achieving the International Development Targets - Environmental Sustainability and Eliminating Poverty (DFID, 2000); Consultation Draft of White Paper on International Development - Globalisation and Development (DFID, 2000); Making the Next Trade Round Work for the World's Poor (DFID, 1999); Future Multilateral Trade Negotiations - a 'Development Round'?

On the other, it recognises the importance of government intervention to address persistent market failures concerning issues such as equity, redistribution and the internalisation of social and environmental costs. Commissioned and funded by Action Aid, CAFOD, the RSPB, UK Food Group (UKFG) and World Wildlife Fund, the following extract from the report pinpoints some of the key assumptions and battlegrounds behind the white paper. Globalisation - a fact of life? According to one department for international development (DIFD) official, \"Globalisation is an unstoppable process involving information technology and the globalisation of markets - globalisation is with us.\" While it is true that part of the globalisation process involves technological change (e.g. improved communications and transport technology) it is also clear that other globalisation processes, such as increasing international mergers and acquisitions, increasing fluidity of capital and increasing interdependence of markets are critically influenced by government policy.

But he insisted that although the 60,000-strong force would co-ordinate with Nato command, it had to be \"independent\" from its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.</p> <p>Given the historic French hostility to the US domination of Nato, President Chirac's comments set alarm bells ringing as EU leaders gathered for a summit designed to smooth the entry of former Soviet bloc states, some of which are already Nato members.</p> <p>Spokesmen for Mr Blair, already under fire from Eurosceptics at home over the alleged threat to Nato, told reporters that the French leader was fully committed to the project. It is designed to let European peacekeepers act in the EU's own backyard in future crises similar to the Kosovo drama which exposed the EU's military impotence.</p> <p>\"The important thing is that the military planning capability rests with Nato,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>Detailed documents to be approved by all 15 leaders today formally declare the EU's support for the 50-year-old Nato alliance. They state explicitly that the rapid reaction force \"does not involve the establishment of a European army\" - the emotive phrase whose use by Tory tabloids has enraged Downing Street.</p> <p>But the timing of the incident is unfortunate for Mr Blair at the start of what promises to be a bruising summit where vital institutional reforms have to be agreed to facilitate decision-making after the EU moves to 15 to an eventual 27 members.</p> <p>Iain Duncan-Smith, shadow defence secretary, jumped into the row in London. \"Tony Blair's cynical attempt to cosy up to the French by betraying Nato is in ruins,\" he said last night. \"The French president has now made clear that the price of the Euro army is the exclusion of the Americans from an alliance which has kept the peace in western Europe for more than 50 years.\"</p> <p>With a UK election expected next spring, Mr Blair knows he must defend Britain's red lines -vetoes on tax and social security. Yesterday his Tory predecessor, John Major, warned him to leave \"plenty of fat\" around his negotiating position to protect those core issues from too much pressure between now and what may prove a deadlocked summit that staggers into Sunday.</p> <p>The Nato spat comes days after a warning from the outgoing US defence secretary, William Cohen, that the alliance could become a \"relic of history\" if the EU does not do more to share its burdens - as Mr Blair wishes - and protect the cohesion of Nato's command structure.</p> <p>In Brussels, Nato officials are expressing concern about France's refusal to commit itself to close cooperation between Nato and the EU on military planning.</p> <p>\"They are refusing to be tied down to an EU-Nato agreement,\" one official said.</p> <p>Britain insists that the main role of the EU's proposed military staff, of some 100 personnel, must be to liaise with Nato.

      "bodyText": "Jacques Chirac, the French host of the crucial EU summit in Nice which opened yesterday, was last night accused of playing domestic politics with European defence policy after insisting that Nato must be kept at arm's length on key military issues. In remarks that irritated Tony Blair, President Chirac used his first summit appearance to underline his long-standing wish to minimise the alliance's role in the new rapid reaction force. The French president, whose police had earlier been forced to dispel anti- summit protesters with teargas, insisted that he had no intention of seeking to weaken Nato. But he insisted that although the 60,000-strong force would co-ordinate with Nato command, it had to be \"independent\" from its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. Given the historic French hostility to the US domination of Nato, President Chirac's comments set alarm bells ringing as EU leaders gathered for a summit designed to smooth the entry of former Soviet bloc states, some of which are already Nato members. Spokesmen for Mr Blair, already under fire from Eurosceptics at home over the alleged threat to Nato, told reporters that the French leader was fully committed to the project. It is designed to let European peacekeepers act in the EU's own backyard in future crises similar to the Kosovo drama which exposed the EU's military impotence. \"The important thing is that the military planning capability rests with Nato,\" the prime minister said. Detailed documents to be approved by all 15 leaders today formally declare the EU's support for the 50-year-old Nato alliance. They state explicitly that the rapid reaction force \"does not involve the establishment of a European army\" - the emotive phrase whose use by Tory tabloids has enraged Downing Street. But the timing of the incident is unfortunate for Mr Blair at the start of what promises to be a bruising summit where vital institutional reforms have to be agreed to facilitate decision-making after the EU moves to 15 to an eventual 27 members. Iain Duncan-Smith, shadow defence secretary, jumped into the row in London. \"Tony Blair's cynical attempt to cosy up to the French by betraying Nato is in ruins,\" he said last night. \"The French president has now made clear that the price of the Euro army is the exclusion of the Americans from an alliance which has kept the peace in western Europe for more than 50 years.\" With a UK election expected next spring, Mr Blair knows he must defend Britain's red lines -vetoes on tax and social security. Yesterday his Tory predecessor, John Major, warned him to leave \"plenty of fat\" around his negotiating position to protect those core issues from too much pressure between now and what may prove a deadlocked summit that staggers into Sunday. The Nato spat comes days after a warning from the outgoing US defence secretary, William Cohen, that the alliance could become a \"relic of history\" if the EU does not do more to share its burdens - as Mr Blair wishes - and protect the cohesion of Nato's command structure. In Brussels, Nato officials are expressing concern about France's refusal to commit itself to close cooperation between Nato and the EU on military planning. \"They are refusing to be tied down to an EU-Nato agreement,\" one official said. Britain insists that the main role of the EU's proposed military staff, of some 100 personnel, must be to liaise with Nato. Though it could have an advisory role, it must not lead to a separate EU command and control structure, says Britain. This is also the position of the US. France is continuing to block arrangements that would automatically and permanently \"lock in\" the EU with Nato, say Nato officials. But diplomats said the French statement was intended largely for domestic political purposes after similar remarks by the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, Mr Chirac's likely rival for the presidency in 2002. Both put on a united front last night. Mr Blair flew to the summit declaring he would defy fellow leaders who want him to surrender Britain's veto in crucial areas as part of the reform of EU decision-making. \"The British position on tax is quite clear,\" he said. \"Every country has got its clear no-go areas and on the issue of tax there is no way we are going to yield up the veto.\" Hot agenda items at the summit are how to reduce the size of the 20-strong European Commission, to extend qualified majority voting into new areas and to re-weight votes in the European Council to give big countries, including Britain, a bigger voice. At the start of the summit , French riot police fought pitched battles with protesters a few hundred yards from the main venue, firing volleys of teargas as fireworks and furniture were hurled towards them. A group of several hundred Spanish anarchists, radical trade unionists and Basque and Corsican separatists were thought to be orchestrating the protests.",

      "body": "<p>Any Buddhist monks making a pilgrimage to the Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat two weeks ago would have been greeted by an unexpected sight: a strikingly pretty, superbly toned young woman engaged in unarmed combat with a group of masked marauders, watched by a full-scale Hollywood production crew. For this sacred site is one of the chief locations used in the filming of Tomb Raider, the first big-screen outing for Eidos's phenomenally successful cyberbabe, Lara Croft. </p> <p>Lara, in the shape of Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie, was looking exceptionally lithe in a jet-black catsuit; the result, apparently, of several months spent bungee jumping, motorbike riding and martial-arts training. Closer examination proved impossible, alas: bystanders who strayed too close to the set were scared off by cries of \"Oi, you! Keep back!\" from a pack of hulking British minders. </p> <p>A few hours later, a group of daytrippers visiting the Bayon temple asked what all the trucks and cameras were for. The temple guide explained that they were filming a \"love story\". Had they been allowed closer to the set, the tourists would have witnessed something rather different: a grim-faced Lara expertly power-sliding her Land Rover through a morass of mud and water for the cameras. </p> <p>For director Simon West, there was never any question about who should play the lead. \"Angelina was always my only choice, not even my first choice,\" he said. \"It really was a one-horse race. If she didn't do it, I can't think who else would have been suitable.\" </p> <p>Tomb Raider is the first film to be shot in Cambodia since Peter O'Toole played Lord Jim in the shadow of Angkor Wat in 1964 (one reason why West wanted to film there). Since then, however, the country has had other things on its plate: bombed by the US during the Vietnam war, ravaged by Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge cadres in the 1970s, under occupation by Vietnamese troops in the 1980s and engulfed in civil war in the early 1990s, it has long been a no-go area for hardened backpackers, never mind unwieldy US film crews. Roland Joffe's The Killing Fields (1984), which described the background to the murder of some two million Cambodians by Pol Pot's regime, was filmed in neighbouring Thailand. </p> <p>So the impact of Tomb Raider could be significant. If the film incarnation of Lara Croft is anything like as successful as her virtual counterpart, Cambodia can expect to enjoy something of a renaissance. Judging by the impact on tourism of the modestly successful Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle The Beach, which triggered a mini-invasion of Thailand's Phi Phi Leh island, Angkor could be swamped with tourists within a couple of years. </p> <p>For a time, though, it looked as if the Cambodian Tourist Board would have to postpone its recruitment drive, since the scenes to be filmed there nearly did not happen at all. Cambodia's film infrastructure is almost nonexistent, and much of the equipment had to be brought in from Thailand along a road that once ran through a Khmer Rouge stronghold. The road is littered with potholes and mines, and the transport crew - with the assistance of a minesweeper and the Royal Cambodian army - had to drive almost 30 trucks full of equipment along it. Inching its way towards Siem Reap, the gateway to the temples, the convoy often had to stop altogether while soldiers repaired the bridges ahead. </p> <p>\"I can't wait until it is all over and they have gone home,\" said a frazzled transportation manager, gulping down a beer at the end of a particularly weary day on set. \"Then I can get some sleep.\" He was, he said, being paid just $500 per week. </p> <p>For most locals, however, used to the daily grind of negotiating washboard roads, the sum represents a king's ransom. Five hundred dollars equates to more than a year's wage for most Cambodians, who usually scrape by on one or two dollars a day. </p> <p>Susan D'Arcy, publicist with the Paramount film unit, said hundreds of Cambodians had been employed for Tomb Raider as extras or crew. Tens of thousands of much-needed dollars have been pumped into the local economy in hotel bills, mobile-phone rentals and wages. </p> <p>For translator Riem Sunsoley, who learned his English in a refugee camp on the Thai border, the film has been a huge boon, earning him $25 a day for five weeks. He is putting the money towards building an orphanage for the street kids who live around the temples. </p> <p>He is thankful to Hollywood, but says political peace is more important. \"If politics does not go downhill then everything will develop. I hope more people from other countries will come to Cambodia,\" he said. </p> <p>Just as valuable as the influx of cash, says Paramount, is the fact that Cambodians are witnessing first-hand how films are made. In the 1960s, Cambodia had a small but vibrant national film industry, largely thanks to the patronage of the country's movie-mad king, Norodom Sihanouk. Its chief output was formulaic, sickly-sweet love stories that were unashamedly cranked out for the masses. But Pol Pot single-handedly devastated the industry, killing most of the directors and actors who failed to flee the country in time. </p> <p>Since the ascension of former Khmer Rouge commander Hun Sen, the country's film industry has remained stagnant, stifled by the popularity of Hollywood and Hong Kong kick-and-chop movies. More importantly, Cambodia has no purpose-built cinemas. The old French colonial theatres have been converted into warehouses, shops or karaoke bars, and most movies are watched at home in the form of pirate videos. The fuss surrounding Ms Jolie and company, hopes the local artistic community, will revive interest in both film and film-making. </p> <p>The film is also good news for the temples. The conservation authority responsible for preserving and protecting the complex is charging Paramount $10,000 per day for seven days. Much of the money will go back into caring for the temples themselves. </p> <p>Cambodia's conservationists have worked hard to avoid the outcry that followed the filming of a Mortal Kombat sequel in Thailand, where fight scenes were shot among the ruins of the Buddhist temples.

What they told us is that there is violence, but that there are no guns and that Khmers [Cambodians] are not portrayed as violent people, but foreigners.\" </p> <p>An extremely detailed contract was also drawn up to ensure that the temples would not be damaged in any way. However, the authorities decided against insisting on total control of what could be filmed. \"Coming out of years of oppressive regimes, it seemed that censorship should not be something that we supported. Cambodia should be open, and violent films should be allowed, even if we don't like them,\" said Ms Thompson. </p> <p>Cambodia has found peace under strongman Hun Sen. But halfway through filming came an unwelcome reminder that the peace is all too fragile. On November 24, the capital, Phnom Penh, reverberated with the sound of gunfire when between 70 and 80 armed men laid siege to the city centre. Eight were killed and scores of suspects were rounded up. The alleged leader of what has been called an attempted coup was later arrested in Siem Reap - just a few hundred yards from where the Tomb Raider crew was staying. </p> <p>If the violence continues, salvaging Cambodia's tarnished image may be a task beyond even Lara Croft.</p>",

The TV presenter is said to have been personally requested by Mr Clinton to front the show. If the deal goes ahead, she will follow the president for a year after he quits to put together a mini-series on life after the presidency. The BBC is thought to be involved in the negotiations, which have yet to be finalised. Such a deal would be an extraordinary coup for Ms Frostrup, who has had to fight criticism that she is just a \"dumb blonde\". She was plunged into controversy last month when she was chosen by the BBC current affairs series Panorama to present a one-off show on reality TV. Her appearance on the flagship show caused consternation in some quarters and led to criticism that the flagship show was being dumbed down. The BBC faced serious embarrassment when Lorraine Heggessey, the new controller of BBC1, dismissed as a joke the idea that Panorama would be presented by Ms Frostrup. It later emerged that the presenter had already been signed up. Ms Frostrup already runs her own production company, Brazen Husky, and works as a presenter for Channel 5.",

The Guardian is a very lucky prize because it's not restricted by nation or race or gender. It's incredibly wide.</p> <p>\"It's got my favourite books of the year on it. I've heard lots of people say it's a sad year for fiction but I think these people were just looking in the wrong direction.\"</p> <p>The seven judges' unofficial runner-up was Naomi Klein's critique of post-modern consumer capitalism and designer label culture, No Logo, a book that has become influential for the world trade talks protest generation and was also a favourite with some readers' groups.</p> <p>The Guardian prize - inaugurated last year - is Smith's first British award, although she was shortlisted for the Orange women-only prize in June and is a finalist in the fiction section of the Whitbread books award, to be decided next month. In October, she won the $10,000 fiction prize in the newly launched International Ebook awards for works converted from print into electronic form.</p> <p>The judges praised White Teeth for its \"muscular prose style\" and \"beautifully drawn characters\", calling it a \"sensationally good novel\", which was \"feisty, funny, satirical, and tender\".</p> <p>This year's judges were the geneticist Steve Jones, the novelists Julian Barnes, David Baddiel and Toby Litt, the broadcaster Kirsty Young and the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger. They were headed by the Guardian's literary editor, Claire Armitstead. The prize is to recognise and reward new fiction.</p> <p>During their final session, Barnes said White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) gave him \"a burn of envy as a fiction writer\". Baddiel said it was \"on its way to being a great novel\". Though Professor Jones acknowledged its astonishing promise, he felt it was very much a young first novel, with too many characters and a simplistic ending. Among Litt's reservations was its \"narrative tricks\" inherited, he felt, from Salman Rushdie.</p> <p>No Logo (Flamingo, \u00a314.99) aroused equal enthusiasm but deeper disappointment. Kirsty Young said: \"People should be strapped to chairs and made to read it.\" Litt called it \"a most important book\". To Baddiel, it was \"incredibly refreshing\", but stylistically pedestrian. Barnes found its analysis lucid but based on too few first-hand interviews. For Jones, it \"fell rather flat\" and was parochial.</p> <p>Also on the shortlist, Dave Eggers' elsewhere highly praised memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99) tells - with what one critic called \"great whooping arcs\" - the story of bringing up his younger brother alone. Litt said it had some of the best writing on the shortlist. Barnes had \"80% praise\". To Baddiel, it was solipsistic and showed the limits of a diarist.</p> <p>Prof Jones said that if the judging was \"on oddness grounds\" Mark Danielewski's post-modern haunted house mystery House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313) would win. It reaped 60% of votes on the Guardian website. Young gave it marks for ambition, Litt found it moving and daring but also apt to undermine itself. Barnes, whom it left unscared, wanted to like it more.</p> <p>Catfish and Mandala (Flamingo, \u00a310.99) is Andrew Pham's account of returning by bicycle to re-explore the Vietnam he left in the 1970s. Barnes spoke of how cleverly it used \"a gentleness and lyricism of tone to describe things of extreme violence\". It was painful and well-written. Jones, also strongly in favour, called it \"very, very powerful\". However, it left Litt and Young cold.</p> <p>Unanimously, the readers' group from Borders Books music cafe in Charing Cross Road, London, chose No Logo for \"an eloquent analysis that deserves to change our cultural outlook\". The Cheshire Oaks group singled out Catfish and Mandala as \"fantastic\" and White Teeth as \"very funny\". The York group also went for Catfish and Mandala and two titles that were not shortlisted - the science writer Mark Buchanan's Ubiquity (Weidenfeld, \u00a320) and TE Carhart's The Piano Shop on the Left Bank (Chatto and Windus, \u00a315.99). A Borders group in Glasgow also judged the books.</p>",

The Guardian prize - inaugurated last year - is Smith's first British award, although she was shortlisted for the Orange women-only prize in June and is a finalist in the fiction section of the Whitbread books award, to be decided next month. In October, she won the $10,000 fiction prize in the newly launched International Ebook awards for works converted from print into electronic form. The judges praised White Teeth for its \"muscular prose style\" and \"beautifully drawn characters\", calling it a \"sensationally good novel\", which was \"feisty, funny, satirical, and tender\". This year's judges were the geneticist Steve Jones, the novelists Julian Barnes, David Baddiel and Toby Litt, the broadcaster Kirsty Young and the Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger. They were headed by the Guardian's literary editor, Claire Armitstead. The prize is to recognise and reward new fiction. During their final session, Barnes said White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) gave him \"a burn of envy as a fiction writer\". Baddiel said it was \"on its way to being a great novel\". Though Professor Jones acknowledged its astonishing promise, he felt it was very much a young first novel, with too many characters and a simplistic ending. Among Litt's reservations was its \"narrative tricks\" inherited, he felt, from Salman Rushdie. No Logo (Flamingo, \u00a314.99) aroused equal enthusiasm but deeper disappointment. Kirsty Young said: \"People should be strapped to chairs and made to read it.\" Litt called it \"a most important book\". To Baddiel, it was \"incredibly refreshing\", but stylistically pedestrian. Barnes found its analysis lucid but based on too few first-hand interviews. For Jones, it \"fell rather flat\" and was parochial. Also on the shortlist, Dave Eggers' elsewhere highly praised memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador, \u00a314.99) tells - with what one critic called \"great whooping arcs\" - the story of bringing up his younger brother alone. Litt said it had some of the best writing on the shortlist. Barnes had \"80% praise\". To Baddiel, it was solipsistic and showed the limits of a diarist. Prof Jones said that if the judging was \"on oddness grounds\" Mark Danielewski's post-modern haunted house mystery House of Leaves (Anchor, \u00a313) would win. It reaped 60% of votes on the Guardian website. Young gave it marks for ambition, Litt found it moving and daring but also apt to undermine itself. Barnes, whom it left unscared, wanted to like it more. Catfish and Mandala (Flamingo, \u00a310.99) is Andrew Pham's account of returning by bicycle to re-explore the Vietnam he left in the 1970s. Barnes spoke of how cleverly it used \"a gentleness and lyricism of tone to describe things of extreme violence\". It was painful and well-written. Jones, also strongly in favour, called it \"very, very powerful\". However, it left Litt and Young cold. Unanimously, the readers' group from Borders Books music cafe in Charing Cross Road, London, chose No Logo for \"an eloquent analysis that deserves to change our cultural outlook\". The Cheshire Oaks group singled out Catfish and Mandala as \"fantastic\" and White Teeth as \"very funny\". The York group also went for Catfish and Mandala and two titles that were not shortlisted - the science writer Mark Buchanan's Ubiquity (Weidenfeld, \u00a320) and TE Carhart's The Piano Shop on the Left Bank (Chatto and Windus, \u00a315.99). A Borders group in Glasgow also judged the books.",

It had been a long shift at the restaurant and in one hand he carried a takeaway curry and in the other a bottle of Irn Bru. He was a Scots Asian.</p> <p>From the window of her council flat above, Mr Chhokar's girlfriend watched him drive into the street, before turning away from the familiar scene. A few minutes later Elizabeth Bryce looked helplessly on while her boyfriend bled to death.</p> <p>As Ms Bryce made her way to the door of her home in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, Mr Chhokar, 32, was met in the street by three white men: Ronnie Coulter, 32; his nephew, Andrew Coulter, 19; and David Montgomery, 23. It was around 11.20pm on November 4 1998, and the three were waiting for Mr Chhokar to resolve a dispute over a stolen giro cheque. Andrew Coulter was armed with a heavy bat. Someone was carrying a knife.</p> <p>Almost as soon as Mr Chhokar met the three men, a scuffle broke out. He tried to back away, but Ronnie Coulter followed and punched him repeatedly. Seconds later, Mr Chhokar was attacked with the bat. Vainly, he swung round the Irn Bru bottle in an attempt to defend himself. Upstairs, his girlfriend heard him scream.</p> <p>Ms Bryce ran to the window; from there she could see the attack. She ran out on to the street and picked up a spade, making for the three men. Mr Chhokar crossed the road towards her and cried out: \"They stabbed me.\"And he had been stabbed - through the heart.</p> <p>Andrew Coulter and Montgomery drove off in their car. Within hours, Ronnie Coulter had scrubbed his and his nephew's clothes clean. The next day, his ex-girlfriend says, he handed her a bag stuffed with the clothes and a set of knives with one blade missing. A few days after the attack, Montgomery had his car valeted before it was sold.</p> <p>\"That night I was sleeping and I heard my daughter-in-law and my grandchildren at the door. They were all crying,\" said Darsham Chhokar, Surjit's father. \"They kept saying, 'Surjit is no more'. I didn't understand.\"</p> <p><b>Set of knives</b><br></p> <p>Within days, Ronnie and Andrew Coulter and Montgomery had been arrested. There were no other suspects; all three admitted being at the scene of the crime. Ronnie and Andrew Coulter shared a first floor flat in a high rise on the rundown Gowkthrapple housing scheme. A few floors above lived Mr Chhokar; he knew both men. But on the morning of December 4, Andrew Coulter broke into Mr Chhokar's flat and stole his giro. Mr Chhokar, even his family admit, was far from an angel, but when he found out Andrew Coulter had stolen his benefit cheque he was furious. Mr Chhokar informed the DSS and told Ms Bryce he planned to bring in the police.</p> <p>Four months after Mr Chhokar's murder, Ronnie Coulter stood trial. No one informed the Chhokar family of the court date, though relatives spotted it in a newspaper. When the family arrived at court, they expected to see all three men in the dock. The crown office has consistently refused to say why Ronnie Coulter stood trial alone.</p> <p>Before he stood trial, Ronnie Coulter lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Andrew Coulter and Montgomery for the murder. The Chhokar family, who speak little English, did not understand what was going on in the court. They were not alone. After six days the trial ended abruptly. Ronnie Coulter was convicted on a charge of assault. The crown did not move for sentencing and he walked free from court.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Why did you decide to start the project? What problem was it created to solve?</strong><br> The origins of the project can be traced to the political lobbying of central government in the 1950s by the two local authorities, Durham county council and Easington district council, over the National Coal Board's practice of disposing of colliery waste by tipping directly onto the beaches.</p> <p><strong>How did you go about putting it together? How and by whom was it funded, and what partners did you have to get involved?</strong><br> The project has a long history. Over the last 50 years, even in the face of an active coal industry, policy documents were produced examining the potential of non-industrial areas of the coast, together with options for different methods of disposal by the coal industry.</p> <p>While these documents demonstrated a commitment to the coastal environment, none of them brought in powers to enforce change, so they were destined to become shelf-bound and dusty. The local authorities were never going to be associated with forcing the mines to close, as the local population had few alternative employment options.</p> <p>The collapse of the industry presented opportunities to address the coastal environment. The last colliery closed in 1993, however the National Trust began buying land on the coast prior to this. </p> <p>This produced a natural partnership of the two authorities and the trust as the major landowners along the coast. Together with the Countryside Commission (now agency), they initiated a series of studies, which informed what became a successful bid to the Millennium Commission.</p> <p>The commission was inviting bids for bold projects and had the capacity to fund very large schemes. The timescale for bids was particularly tight but, using the studies as a starting point, the partners sent in the project bid for Turning the Tide.</p> <p>The commission announced an award of \u00a34.5m in principle in December 1995, although negotiations were not completed until June 1997.</p> <p><strong>What did it cost?</strong><br> The project is still active but we forecast a project cost of approximately \u00a310.4m. The Millennium Commission supplied \u00a34.5m, Durham county council \u00a3450,000, English Partnerships \u00a32.2m, British Coal \u00a3510,000, the Countryside Agency \u00a3770,000, and European structural funds provided \u00a31.2m. Smaller amounts of money came from a range of other sources.</p> <p><strong>How long did it take?</strong><br> Although the programme was originally going to last five years, negotiation issues with the commission delayed the start. We began in earnest around spring 1997, and so will have been active for around four years when we formally wrap in March 2001.</p> <p><strong>Is it working?</strong><br> Yes. The project is very broad in nature and it's difficult to summarise. The obvious physical changes have been very successful, and have been complemented with \"softer\" projects such as art projects, community consultation and involvement. A point worth making is the role of the Millennium Commission funding. While it is tied into the overall project objectives, we have been allowed to use it flexibly. Therefore, during the course of the programme as new opportunities have arisen or issues have forced change, we have been able to respond appropriately, rather than lose ground.</p> <p><strong>What difficulties did you encounter?</strong><br> Negotiations with the Millennium Commission became lengthy and a little protracted. As a programme of 100 smaller projects, Turning the Tide did not fit easily into the standard funding contract, which had been developed around the single major project model.</p> <p>Land purchase - the habitat reversion project relied on our ability to purchase specific agricultural land in the coastal zone. Although we had the finance, we had no immediate recourse to compulsory purchase orders. Initially, the landowners did not want to sell. Ultimately, we have purchased all the land targeted, but this has taken some time to assemble.</p> <p>Community liaison - the project had been brought together so quickly it had little community endorsement. The challenge has been to inform, consult and involve the community in a programme of 100 projects being delivered in a tight timescale. </p> <p>Project team - the team was recruited specifically for the project. As we are on fixed term contracts, the team is now fragmenting - a common experience. This is causing difficulty in maintaining the project delivery.</p> <p><strong>Would you recommend it to other authorities? Why?</strong><br> The project reflects very specific issues facing the Durham coast. In terms of good practice, we feel there is a great deal to be learned from our experiences - and no doubt to be improved upon. It is worth noting that our principles of partnership were established before the funding opportunity arose - many partnerships are not too strong and do not survive post project. The Turning the Tide partners are already considering what to do next.</p> <p><strong>Would you do it again?</strong><br> Yes. Whatever the issues, the principles and processes adopted in Turning the Tide should be compatible.</p>",

The origins of the project can be traced to the political lobbying of central government in the 1950s by the two local authorities, Durham county council and Easington district council, over the National Coal Board's practice of disposing of colliery waste by tipping directly onto the beaches. How did you go about putting it together? How and by whom was it funded, and what partners did you have to get involved? The project has a long history. Over the last 50 years, even in the face of an active coal industry, policy documents were produced examining the potential of non-industrial areas of the coast, together with options for different methods of disposal by the coal industry. While these documents demonstrated a commitment to the coastal environment, none of them brought in powers to enforce change, so they were destined to become shelf-bound and dusty. The local authorities were never going to be associated with forcing the mines to close, as the local population had few alternative employment options. The collapse of the industry presented opportunities to address the coastal environment. The last colliery closed in 1993, however the National Trust began buying land on the coast prior to this. This produced a natural partnership of the two authorities and the trust as the major landowners along the coast. Together with the Countryside Commission (now agency), they initiated a series of studies, which informed what became a successful bid to the Millennium Commission. The commission was inviting bids for bold projects and had the capacity to fund very large schemes. The timescale for bids was particularly tight but, using the studies as a starting point, the partners sent in the project bid for Turning the Tide. The commission announced an award of \u00a34.5m in principle in December 1995, although negotiations were not completed until June 1997. What did it cost? The project is still active but we forecast a project cost of approximately \u00a310.4m. The Millennium Commission supplied \u00a34.5m, Durham county council \u00a3450,000, English Partnerships \u00a32.2m, British Coal \u00a3510,000, the Countryside Agency \u00a3770,000, and European structural funds provided \u00a31.2m. Smaller amounts of money came from a range of other sources. How long did it take? Although the programme was originally going to last five years, negotiation issues with the commission delayed the start. We began in earnest around spring 1997, and so will have been active for around four years when we formally wrap in March 2001. Is it working? Yes. The project is very broad in nature and it's difficult to summarise. The obvious physical changes have been very successful, and have been complemented with \"softer\" projects such as art projects, community consultation and involvement. A point worth making is the role of the Millennium Commission funding. While it is tied into the overall project objectives, we have been allowed to use it flexibly. Therefore, during the course of the programme as new opportunities have arisen or issues have forced change, we have been able to respond appropriately, rather than lose ground. What difficulties did you encounter? Negotiations with the Millennium Commission became lengthy and a little protracted. As a programme of 100 smaller projects, Turning the Tide did not fit easily into the standard funding contract, which had been developed around the single major project model. Land purchase - the habitat reversion project relied on our ability to purchase specific agricultural land in the coastal zone. Although we had the finance, we had no immediate recourse to compulsory purchase orders. Initially, the landowners did not want to sell. Ultimately, we have purchased all the land targeted, but this has taken some time to assemble. Community liaison - the project had been brought together so quickly it had little community endorsement. The challenge has been to inform, consult and involve the community in a programme of 100 projects being delivered in a tight timescale. Project team - the team was recruited specifically for the project. As we are on fixed term contracts, the team is now fragmenting - a common experience. This is causing difficulty in maintaining the project delivery. Would you recommend it to other authorities? Why? The project reflects very specific issues facing the Durham coast. In terms of good practice, we feel there is a great deal to be learned from our experiences - and no doubt to be improved upon. It is worth noting that our principles of partnership were established before the funding opportunity arose - many partnerships are not too strong and do not survive post project. The Turning the Tide partners are already considering what to do next. Would you do it again? Yes. Whatever the issues, the principles and processes adopted in Turning the Tide should be compatible.",

The force will retain links with Nato despite claims from the French president Jacques Chirac yesterday that it would be independent. His remarks led many to speculate that the rapid reaction force would split Nato but, said Tony Blair's official spokesman, such claims were \"hysterical nonsense\". Europe minister Keith Vaz said that the 60,000-strong force would only be used when Nato was not involved. And Mr Chirac sought to reassure the plan's critics: \"No one in Europe is in any way questioning the importance or the status of the Atlantic alliance,\" he said. \"There is no reason to be concerned. Europe is going to make its own contribution to its own security.\" The EU wants the rapid reaction force to give it an autonomous capacity to make military decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, conduct EU-led military operations. That force will require permanent political and military bodies to run it. It is expected to be complete in 2003.

      "bodyText": "MPs will be given the chance to ban fox hunting in a controversial government bill that was unveiled today. Home office minister Mike O'Brien said that they would receive a free vote on three options - self regulation through an independent supervisory body, a licensing regime to regulate hunting, and a ban on all hunting with dogs, except in a few limited circumstances. If MPs vote to outlaw the sport, as is expected, peers will still have the opportunity to debate all the options when the Hunting Bill reaches the Lords. Mr O'Brien said that the government remained neutral on the issue. He said: \"This is an important and controversial issue as has been evidenced by the space given to it in the newspapers and by the amount of correspondence we get here on it. \"Lots of attempts have been made to deal with hunting by way of private members' bills but all have failed. Our hope is that, by bringing forward a government bill, we can deal with the contentious issue in a clear and straightforward way.\" The second reading debate takes place on Monday December 18, followed by a committee stage on the floor of the Commons. The minister added: \"The government is neutral on the issue and individual MPs will be able to vote as they feel appropriate.\" The bill proposes a maximum \u00a35,000 penalty for breaking a hunting ban. Prince Charles enjoys foxhunting, but Mr O'Brien confirmed there have been no discussions with the royal family about the bill. However, a clash between the Commons and the Lords is almost certain. When asked if the view of the elected chamber will prevail in the event that MPs vote for a ban and peers support one of the other options, Mr O'Brien replied: \"Procedures of parliament will be followed. \"Both the Commons and the Lords have their appropriate role, and the Commons is obviously the elected chamber.\" Urged to disclose whether ministers would use the Parliament Act to steamroller the bill into law if the Lords refuses to accept a total ban, Mr O'Brien said: \"Obviously, the Parliament Act is available, but we've made no decision on whether to use it. \"That will be a matter for the Commons rather than the government.\" The Countryside Alliance warns that thousands of rural jobs will disappear if a ban comes in, but Mr O'Brien confirmed that there are no plans for compensation. He added that the alliance had a \"democratic right to protest\", provided it was done peacefully and did not disrupt the lives of others. The home secretary, Jack Straw, said: \"I believe that this bill should allow the issue of hunting properly to be resolved. \"It is plainly an issue which arouses strong views on all sides of the argument.\" The Home Office has received 100,000 letters from the public about hunting since 1997, showing opinion fairly evenly divided on the issue. Public opinion polls however, are in favour of a ban. Richard Burge, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the Bill \"curtails a rural minority's civil liberty, with no benefits for the rural majority or for animal welfare\". Douglas Batchelor, chairman of pressure group Deadline 2000 and chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \"Parliament has debated hunting many times before but never with a government bill and a guarantee of parliamentary time. \"This is an historic opportunity to finally end this cruel and barbaric practice which has no place in a modern society.\" The shadow home affairs minister, David Lidington said: \"This bill is a classic example of Labour's warped sense of priorities.

Free market meritocrats who seek the cliched level playing field are as withering about the nature of inherited privilege as the egalitarians of the left. But these basically anti-monarchist proselytisers for freedom of thought and freedom of the press dare not tell their readers what they really think. <br></p> <p>Tabloids, the papers with mass circulations, have been particularly shy, though in recent years some columnists - notably Richard Littlejohn in the Sun - have been allowed to advance their \"controversial\" views. Campaigning day after day against the euro is fine. Editors have never contemplated - or dared - doing the same to monarchy. <br></p> <p>Why? Because they believe there is such widespread and deep public support for the royal family that they might face a backlash from readers. The monarchy does have one rabid press champion, as yesterday's Daily Telegraph illustrated. It ran six separate articles prompted by the Guardian's call for a referendum on the monarchy. A leader writer huffed while the court and social writer puffed. But columnist Daniel Johnson stooped to make the lowest bow. The Guardian campaign is both ludicrous and sinister, he wrote, though that description more aptly fitted his own assertion of some of the monarch's greatest virtues: her cosmopolitan appeal to ethnic minorities; her stabilising political role; and the sense of continuity represented by inherited privilege. <br></p> <p>Now we come to the second paradox. Editors, based on a century of experience since the dawn of popular papers, believe royalty is a seller. Good, upbeat, stage managed stories sell. But exposures of private behaviour sell best of all. Yet editors also know that the revelation of royal family secrets tends to bring the monarchy into disrepute. By training the spotlight on them, they undermine the notion of the family's supposedly special place at the apex of society. <br></p> <p>That's a risk they are prepared to take since they are working for commercial entities which must maximise sales and profits. The initial peeling away of the royal magic during the 1950s was tentative, but its anti-deferential spirit still managed to upset the Queen and her advisers. Hugh Cudlipp, editorial director of the Daily Mirror, led the charge. One of his most famous front pages shocked the palace by implying that the young Queen and her husband, who was in Gibraltar while she was in England, were having marital difficulties. \"Fly Home, Philip!\" said the headline, to kill \"ridiculous and baseless\" rumours. <br></p> <p>In another sally from the same period, the Mirror made an unsubtle attempt to pierce the wall of silence about Princess Margaret's romance with Peter Townsend with a front page demand: \"Come on Margaret, Please Make Up Your Mind\". This kind of timid criticism was rare, although the Daily Sketch, then edited by Bert Gunn, a sort of 1950s Kelvin MacKenzie, got into trouble when one of its reporters attempted to smuggle herself into the Duke of Kent's wedding reception in the back of a car. Gunn thumbed his nose at the resulting censure by the Press Council but also obsequiously apologised to the palace. And so it has been ever since, through Margaret's rocky love life, Prince Charles's upbringing and his romances, culminating in the press orgy over the most saleable non-royal royal of all, Princess Diana. The papers have intruded and retreated, feigning abject sorrow for any hurt caused to her majesty, then waiting for the next opportunity to intrude all over again. <br></p> <p>Despite their pledges of good behaviour they just can't help themselves. The Windsors star in Britain's real-life soap opera. And here is the third paradox: the family needs the press as much as the press needs the family. They cannot afford to retreat entirely from the public gaze because that risks alienating people. <br></p> <p>So they have courted publicity only to find that it is impossible to draw a line. That takes us to the fourth paradox. The public consumes and condemns with equal enthusiasm. Readers lap up the stories and pictures, then they decry the methods used to obtain them. It is this deep vein of hypocrisy which lies at the heart of the whole enigma. The monarch is a golden goose which the public, through the press, is bound to kill. <br></p> <p>Since Diana's death, some of the palace's newer and wiser advisers have realised this fact. Hence the subtle marketing of Prince Charles, culminating recently in his being pictured with an Aids baby in his arms, and the trenchant protection of Prince William. For the moment the press appears to be dancing to the palace's tune. It cannot last. This is a celebrity driven age in which the public cannibalises its idols and the royal family are the ultimate celebrities.

He told a press conference in the Brentwood and Ongar constituency today that being an MP was \"the best thing\" that had ever happened to him, and he regretted his tactical decision to stand only once. It was important to maintain an independent presence in the House of Commons, he said. He had been invited to stand for the seat by concerned locals amid claims that the local Conservative constituency association has been infiltrated by evangelical Christians from a local church. The seat was held for the Conservatives at the last general election by Eric Pickles with a majority of 9,690, making it the sixth safest Tory seat in the country. Since then, however, some 200 members of the charismatic Peniel Pentecostal Church have enrolled in the local party and voted their members into key posts, including the deputy chairman of the constituency association. A number of ousted party members, who formed an independent conservative group, subsequently contacted Mr Bell expressing concern about the influence wielded by the church in the party. However, Mr Bell faces a tough fight to hold on to his place in parliament. In 1997, Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates stood down to allow him a clear run.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After the Hague summit, a meeting in Bonn, in May 2001 will provide the next opportunity for politicians from industrialised countries to agree how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The current target for developed countries is a 5.2% overall emissions reduction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that 60 - 80% is needed, while the head of the UN Environment Programme puts the figure at 90%. Fogged by diplomatic incidents the way forward becomes harder.</p> <p>The potential loopholes in the Kyoto Protocol meant that a bad agreement in the Hague could have been worse than none. The original negotiating position of the United States allowed for a deal that might have led not to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions, but a 14 per cent increase over the period 1990 - 2010. Some said that the manipulation of so-called carbon sinks was a form of carbon laundering.</p> <p>Indeed, the current hiatus could turn out to be an opportunity. Firstly, because people are increasingly aware that the consequences of declining fossil fuel resources and climate change cannot be avoided. And secondly, because more coherent solutions than the Kyoto Protocol are being promoted and gathering support.</p> <p>In 1965 discoveries of new oil sources peaked. Thirty-five years later the growth in oil production has also peaked and begun its long decline. In 1998, adding together total world energy demand over the next few decades with known or anticipated available fuel sources, the International Energy Agency noticed there was a gap between supply and potential demand.</p> <p>To fill the gap it used something called \"unidentified unconventional\" fuel sources. But this fuel didn't actually exist, it was an exercise in creative accounting to stop policy makers from worrying. Looking ahead for the next few decades, uncertain comfort is now available from new projections that fill the supply-demand gap with fossil fuels that have only a 5% chance of discovery.</p> <p>Statistically, neither sinks nor better efficiency can make the necessary cuts in emissions, or deal with declining oil supplies. Over a 200 year period efficiency would need to improve nearly 200 thousand per cent. It seems we must brace ourselves for the equivalent of an environmental war economy in order to reduce consumption.</p> <p>Past experience shows that the shift to a low-energy economy needn't be all bad. The alternative of business-as-usual also looks far worse. Projections based on data collected by the reinsurance giant Munich Re show that by about the year 2065 the economic costs of climate change could surpass the value of total world economic output. Already by 2025, half of all people living in developing countries will be vulnerable to extreme weather events, floods and storms according to the UN.</p> <p>Conventional economic growth is hard-wired to rising greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations - the so-called lock-step. The question is how to break that lock-step and manage our withdrawal from fossil-fuels in as painless a way as possible, within an orderly framework?</p> <p>Transport, trade and agriculture are the parts of our economy that are especially fuel-addicted. But given the right approach and the necessary policy tools there is no reason why we cannot turn things around and benefit from the process. During the Second World War we adapted to measures for radical resource conservation. Even in the United States fuel was strictly rationed to eliminate unnecessary travel.</p> <p>At the moment the internal dynamics of globalisation are making us more, not less, fuel dependent. Air freight, the most polluting transport mode, has gone from virtually zero fifty years ago, to the equivalent of flying one ton of goods over 100 billion kilometres a year. New generations of planes are being built, thirsty for fossil fuel, which will need to fly for decades still to pay-off construction costs.</p> <p>There is a model called contraction and convergence rapidly gaining support.

      "bodyText": "After the Hague summit, a meeting in Bonn, in May 2001 will provide the next opportunity for politicians from industrialised countries to agree how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The current target for developed countries is a 5.2% overall emissions reduction. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that 60 - 80% is needed, while the head of the UN Environment Programme puts the figure at 90%. Fogged by diplomatic incidents the way forward becomes harder. The potential loopholes in the Kyoto Protocol meant that a bad agreement in the Hague could have been worse than none. The original negotiating position of the United States allowed for a deal that might have led not to a cut in greenhouse gas emissions, but a 14 per cent increase over the period 1990 - 2010. Some said that the manipulation of so-called carbon sinks was a form of carbon laundering. Indeed, the current hiatus could turn out to be an opportunity. Firstly, because people are increasingly aware that the consequences of declining fossil fuel resources and climate change cannot be avoided. And secondly, because more coherent solutions than the Kyoto Protocol are being promoted and gathering support. In 1965 discoveries of new oil sources peaked. Thirty-five years later the growth in oil production has also peaked and begun its long decline. In 1998, adding together total world energy demand over the next few decades with known or anticipated available fuel sources, the International Energy Agency noticed there was a gap between supply and potential demand. To fill the gap it used something called \"unidentified unconventional\" fuel sources. But this fuel didn't actually exist, it was an exercise in creative accounting to stop policy makers from worrying. Looking ahead for the next few decades, uncertain comfort is now available from new projections that fill the supply-demand gap with fossil fuels that have only a 5% chance of discovery. Statistically, neither sinks nor better efficiency can make the necessary cuts in emissions, or deal with declining oil supplies. Over a 200 year period efficiency would need to improve nearly 200 thousand per cent. It seems we must brace ourselves for the equivalent of an environmental war economy in order to reduce consumption. Past experience shows that the shift to a low-energy economy needn't be all bad. The alternative of business-as-usual also looks far worse. Projections based on data collected by the reinsurance giant Munich Re show that by about the year 2065 the economic costs of climate change could surpass the value of total world economic output. Already by 2025, half of all people living in developing countries will be vulnerable to extreme weather events, floods and storms according to the UN. Conventional economic growth is hard-wired to rising greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations - the so-called lock-step. The question is how to break that lock-step and manage our withdrawal from fossil-fuels in as painless a way as possible, within an orderly framework? Transport, trade and agriculture are the parts of our economy that are especially fuel-addicted. But given the right approach and the necessary policy tools there is no reason why we cannot turn things around and benefit from the process. During the Second World War we adapted to measures for radical resource conservation. Even in the United States fuel was strictly rationed to eliminate unnecessary travel. At the moment the internal dynamics of globalisation are making us more, not less, fuel dependent. Air freight, the most polluting transport mode, has gone from virtually zero fifty years ago, to the equivalent of flying one ton of goods over 100 billion kilometres a year. New generations of planes are being built, thirsty for fossil fuel, which will need to fly for decades still to pay-off construction costs. There is a model called contraction and convergence rapidly gaining support. Already backed by many developing countries, its principles were endorsed in The Hague by Belgium, France and Sweden and it accords with the US desire for a truly global solution. Pioneered by the London-based Global Commons Institute it was also recently endorsed by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. It works by setting a global cap on greenhouse gas concentrations, with an emissions budget that is reduced over time. Tradable emissions rights are then pre-distributed on a per-capita basis, converging globally to equal shares per person by an agreed date, for example 2030. While the city of Bonn may no longer house the German government, next May it will be at the centre of the most important international negotiation there is. \u2022 Andrew Simms is head of the global economy programme at the New Economics Foundation and co-author of: Collision Course - Free trade's free ride on the global climate",

Branding at Bloomsbury Other web activity this week involved the relaunch of Bloomsbury's website. It has a new name, Bloomsburymagazine.com, and a mission to be an \"exciting blend of literary magazine, reference library, publisher and bookshop\".

      "body": "<p>There is a consensus among film writers that this has been a duff year at the movies. And casting one's eye about as Christmas approaches, it is hard not to think they have a point. Where is this year's Magnolia? Its American Beauty? Its Being John Malkovich? Where are the out-of-nowhere surprises such as The Sixth Sense or The Blair Witch Project? They're nowhere. </p> <p>I have to confess that if I had my way, every year would be 1955: Cinemascope and three-strip Technicolor would be at their high tide, the studios would still be intact and Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, Nicholas Ray and Vincente Minnelli would all still be riding a foam-crested wave. European cinema would be preparing to enter its most magnificent quarter-century, with New Waves about to break over Italy, France, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Britain to a lesser extent and West Germany to a much greater extent. There was so much left to learn, so many surprises still in store for us. I can dream. But if I had all this I suppose I'd also have to put up with segregation and vice-president Nixon. </p> <p>And so we return to the present-imperfect tense: this year, discovering good movies was a process like sifting through dogshit for diamond rings - nasty, dirty work. There was the by now overfamiliar parade of remakes, retreads and rereleases that, if they were like The Exorcist, shamed the contemporary company they kept in the US's multiplexes. I'm paid to go to the movies but there were plenty of weekends when I wouldn't have gone to the movies if you'd, well, paid me. </p> <p>Here at the end of the year, however, there is a sudden flurry of promising new releases, most primed for Oscar consideration, that may prove me wrong. As everyone is now aware, the harrowing four-month ordeal we call the Oscar process is now under way, competing on LA news pages with Byzantine dirty-cop scandals and the post-electoral farce. </p> <p>A slew of this year's critical and commercial hits have been catapulted into a limited rerelease. Thus one can briefly see Gladiator and Wonder Boys, Erin Brockovich and Chicken Run on the big screen again. And, more importantly, you can also see them in full-page ads in the LA Times, where films can reinstall themselves in the collective consciousness of the Academy's voting base. </p> <p>Smaller ads make claims for the virtues of smaller movies such as Almost Famous, Requiem for a Dream, Pay It Forward and Quills. Then there will be a set of one-week limited releases - prereleases, really - to enable movies that will receive a wide release in the new year to qualify for Oscar nominations. </p> <p>This will include Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, which may go some way towards restoring Zemeckis's soiled reputation, and which stars the always Oscar-hungry Tom Hanks. Also opening is Ang Lee's magnificent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which fulfils one of my recent dreams: returning the great Chow Yun-Fat to his original Asian context. It is also that rare and blessed thing - a martial arthouse movie. I want it to win everything. </p> <p>I am glad to see that some of Hollywood's earliest Oscar contenders have fallen at the first hurdle (a pox on the first movie of the year to feature the words \"Oscar-worthy!\" on its poster). One of these was Pay It Forward, a sudsy melodrama in the Magnificent Obsession mould (in its dreams). Its casting looked like a masterclass in Oscar-seeking: Helen Hunt (playing working class, titter), Kevin Spacey (playing ugly) and that brat from The Sixth Sense. Its ambitions were swiftly hobbled by audiences. </p> <p>It was joined in oblivion by Men of Honor, a movie beset by one of those tell-it-all trailers and by Robert De Niro's improbable southern accent. I'm also hoping that the nauseating The Legend of Bagger Vance will lose its momentum before anyone is sick enough to reward its sugary lies about the nature of the old south. </p> <p>Meanwhile we can expect heavy campaigning by the makers of other films: Proof of Life (starring the wonderfully thuggish Russell Crowe); Thirteen Days, Kevin Costner's Cuban missile crisis thriller; M Night Shamalyan's Unbreakable; Remember the Titans; and The Contender. </p> <p>But for me the best news of all is that there are so many British films deemed worthy of consideration. Chicken Run is doing the rounds again, and the crowd-pleasing Billy Elliot is on the verge of a wide release in hopes of Full Monty-size takings. Michael Winterbottom's The Claim is staking (forgive me) its claim. </p> <p>Sadly Croupier (pictured), my nomination for best movie, seems to have been excluded from the competition because it played for five minutes in Singapore a few years ago. Nonetheless, Croupier's stateside success - the result of a two-year marketing slog in the teeth of the fiercest, stupidest resistance imaginable - has not only garnered the film numerous critical plaudits, it has shamed distributors into rereleasing it in its own country, where it was barely given a chance to succeed on its original unveiling. </p> <p>The great Mike Hodges, vindicated at last. And Terence Davies's luminous adaptation of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, which still burns in my head several days after seeing it, is proof that Britain is not short on world-class film-makers. Best Picture, if there's any justice at all.</p>",

European cinema would be preparing to enter its most magnificent quarter-century, with New Waves about to break over Italy, France, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Britain to a lesser extent and West Germany to a much greater extent. There was so much left to learn, so many surprises still in store for us. I can dream. But if I had all this I suppose I'd also have to put up with segregation and vice-president Nixon. And so we return to the present-imperfect tense: this year, discovering good movies was a process like sifting through dogshit for diamond rings - nasty, dirty work. There was the by now overfamiliar parade of remakes, retreads and rereleases that, if they were like The Exorcist, shamed the contemporary company they kept in the US's multiplexes. I'm paid to go to the movies but there were plenty of weekends when I wouldn't have gone to the movies if you'd, well, paid me. Here at the end of the year, however, there is a sudden flurry of promising new releases, most primed for Oscar consideration, that may prove me wrong. As everyone is now aware, the harrowing four-month ordeal we call the Oscar process is now under way, competing on LA news pages with Byzantine dirty-cop scandals and the post-electoral farce. A slew of this year's critical and commercial hits have been catapulted into a limited rerelease. Thus one can briefly see Gladiator and Wonder Boys, Erin Brockovich and Chicken Run on the big screen again. And, more importantly, you can also see them in full-page ads in the LA Times, where films can reinstall themselves in the collective consciousness of the Academy's voting base. Smaller ads make claims for the virtues of smaller movies such as Almost Famous, Requiem for a Dream, Pay It Forward and Quills. Then there will be a set of one-week limited releases - prereleases, really - to enable movies that will receive a wide release in the new year to qualify for Oscar nominations. This will include Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, which may go some way towards restoring Zemeckis's soiled reputation, and which stars the always Oscar-hungry Tom Hanks. Also opening is Ang Lee's magnificent Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which fulfils one of my recent dreams: returning the great Chow Yun-Fat to his original Asian context. It is also that rare and blessed thing - a martial arthouse movie. I want it to win everything. I am glad to see that some of Hollywood's earliest Oscar contenders have fallen at the first hurdle (a pox on the first movie of the year to feature the words \"Oscar-worthy!\" on its poster). One of these was Pay It Forward, a sudsy melodrama in the Magnificent Obsession mould (in its dreams). Its casting looked like a masterclass in Oscar-seeking: Helen Hunt (playing working class, titter), Kevin Spacey (playing ugly) and that brat from The Sixth Sense. Its ambitions were swiftly hobbled by audiences. It was joined in oblivion by Men of Honor, a movie beset by one of those tell-it-all trailers and by Robert De Niro's improbable southern accent. I'm also hoping that the nauseating The Legend of Bagger Vance will lose its momentum before anyone is sick enough to reward its sugary lies about the nature of the old south. Meanwhile we can expect heavy campaigning by the makers of other films: Proof of Life (starring the wonderfully thuggish Russell Crowe); Thirteen Days, Kevin Costner's Cuban missile crisis thriller; M Night Shamalyan's Unbreakable; Remember the Titans; and The Contender. But for me the best news of all is that there are so many British films deemed worthy of consideration. Chicken Run is doing the rounds again, and the crowd-pleasing Billy Elliot is on the verge of a wide release in hopes of Full Monty-size takings. Michael Winterbottom's The Claim is staking (forgive me) its claim. Sadly Croupier (pictured), my nomination for best movie, seems to have been excluded from the competition because it played for five minutes in Singapore a few years ago. Nonetheless, Croupier's stateside success - the result of a two-year marketing slog in the teeth of the fiercest, stupidest resistance imaginable - has not only garnered the film numerous critical plaudits, it has shamed distributors into rereleasing it in its own country, where it was barely given a chance to succeed on its original unveiling. The great Mike Hodges, vindicated at last. And Terence Davies's luminous adaptation of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, which still burns in my head several days after seeing it, is proof that Britain is not short on world-class film-makers. Best Picture, if there's any justice at all.",

This is a shame because Stir of Echoes is a ghost story that gives you a real jolt from time to time and its main couple are the estimable Kevin Bacon - better than the film he's in, as usual - and Kathryn Erbe, who has witchy potential but is cast here in the straight worried wife role. </p>",

Leicester's manager Peter Taylor is to tempt Ipswich with a \u00a35m offer for their in-form striker Marcus Stewart, according to the Daily Star. Taylor will also try and sign Chelsea's Jody Morris as a replacement for Neil Lennon. \"Morris is a player I really like. He has got great ability and is certainly a player that would be in my thoughts without a doubt,\" Taylor said. Liverpool are prepared to sell Robbie Fowler to accommodate Internazionale's Robbie Keane, according to the Yorkshire Post. A spokesman for Gerard Houllier's team denied the report. Meanwhile, Teamtalk claims that Keane will move to Leeds for \u00a318m next summer if they grant Inter first refusal on Harry Kewell. Tottenham fans finally have something to celebrate after Ramon Vega suggested in the Daily Star that he will leave the club in the summer. \"I have six months to go and from January I can talk to other clubs so it's a good position to be in,\" the hapless defender said. \"If the club wants to talk to me I will listen but I can always wait and see if other offers come in.\" Paolo di Canio's spat with David James continues with the West Ham forward saying that Aston Villa's goalkeeper has \"a brain the size of a pea\". The pair have been at each other's throats all week after James finally responded to Di Canio calling him a \"cretin\" and a \"moron\" a year ago. More of the same can be expected after the match between the two sides tomorrow.",

The extraordinary general meeting backed the \u00a351bn deal by 98%, creating a multi-media conglomerate called Vivendi Universal. Canal Plus is 49%-owned by French media company Vivendi, which will now merge with Seagram's Universal Film and Universal Music operations. Vivendi will use its internet and telecoms interests, which include the Vizzavi mobile internet service, to take advantage of Universal's substantial content catalogue. The deal catapults the company into third position in global media rankings, behind CBS-Viacom of the US and AOL-Time Warner, which will be the world's number one company if it wins regulatory approval. However, rumours continue to circle of a board-level dispute between Canal Plus and Vivendi, amid reports that Canal Plus boss Pierre Lescure has fallen out with his Vivendi counterpart, Jean-Marie Messier. The two are believed to have clashed over the future independence of the channel. \"It's not a merger, it's a seizure,\" said one Canal Plus manager at a staff meeting recently. Managers at the pay-TV channel have complained that its parent company will take control of the whole operation, although Vivendi has promised to give Canal Plus independence in the areas of marketing and editorial direction. Meanwhile, French film industry associations have launched legal challenges to the merger, claiming Canal Plus will be swamped by its partners, endangering the French TV and film industry. Vivendi co-financed 80% of all French feature films produced last year.",

      "bodyText": "Picture the scene. \"So, Mr Bond, we meet at last!\" Special Agent 007 has finally made it to Afghanistan and is face to face with a fabulously wealthy but evil genius who is out to destroy the world: Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden presses a button and the top lifts off a mountain to reveal his infernal death machine. But Bond and his shapely companion sabotage the computers and escape with only seconds to spare before the mountain self-destructs, taking Bin Laden with it. Bond and his girl retire triumphantly to a luxury pad in Kabul - only to be arrested by the Taliban and shot for immodest behaviour. This would certainly put a neat end to Bin Laden and, perhaps just as usefully, to the James Bond films - but real life isn't like that. Since the end of the Afghan war, Osama Bin Laden has become synonymous with Islamic terrorism. If intelligence services are to be believed, he and his associates have been involved in terrorist plots in such far-flung countries as Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Yemen. This week, American and Yemeni investigators said that they had uncovered evidence linking him to the bombing of the USS Cole in Aden on October 12, which killed 17 sailors. In the United States, he is on the FBI's \"Ten most wanted men\" list, but missile attacks on his Afghan hideout have failed to dislodge him, and the offer of a $5m reward has not, so far, led to his capture. The latest plan is to try to prise him out of Afghanistan through a UN security council resolution - sponsored by the US and Russia - which would tighten a ban on air travel to the country and freeze the Taliban's assets abroad. But the question that has to be asked is what this would achieve. Putting him on trial would immeasurably enhance his prestige among Islamic militants, and executing him would create a martyr: one more reason for the extremists to attack Americans. The other big question is whether, with Bin Laden out of the way, anti-American terrorism would stop or even be substantially reduced. Focusing on Bin Laden as the \"mastermind\" or instigator behind virtually all serious attacks on US overseas interests is not only pointless but also rather foolish. It encourages the idea (comforting for many Americans) that such attacks have no real motive: Bin Laden is mad or has some kind of grudge and pays people to do these things. It's only his charisma, money and technical know-how that keeps them going. This avoids having to confront more disturbing questions about perceptions of the way America throws its weight around and the resentment that this arouses among many ordinary Muslims, not just terrorists. Bin Laden, who is now aged 43 or perhaps a little older, started out as a respected and wealthy Saudi businessman, having studied management and economics at King Abd al-Aziz University in Jeddah. His family came originally from southern Yemen, but prospered in the kingdom through their construction business. Today, they are considered the wealthiest non-royal family in Saudi Arabia. During the Afghan war of the 1980s, Usama bin Laden - in common with many other Saudi businessmen - saw a religious duty to support the Islamic rebels financially against Moscow's puppet regime. He could afford to be more generous than most, and he also became more deeply involved than most. Not only did he pay for weapons and what, by his own account, were thousands of Muslim volunteers from the Middle East and North Africa to join the Mujahideen, he went there himself and took part in the fighting. Using the resources of his construction business, he blasted new guerrilla trails across the mountains and tunnelled into the rock to create underground hospitals and arms dumps. The United States at the time also supported the Mujahideen, since it regarded the Soviet Union as a greater threat, and must therefore carry some responsibility for what happened next. The Soviet withdrawal left many of these volunteer fighters at a loose end but still filled with the spirit of jihad. In some ways, they were like the American veterans after Vietnam - deprived of adrenalin and unable to adjust to a quiet life. But, unlike the Vietnam veterans, their efforts had not been futile. They had defeated a superpower and were flushed with success. Many - including Bin Laden - told of narrow escapes from death, which led them to believe that God had preserved them for a purpose. Unwelcome in their home countries, they dispersed throughout the Muslim world and often became involved in local Islamist movements, where they were known as \"Afghans\". The effect of the Afghan war was to create an international network - largely informal - of people who had a shared experience and a sense of common purpose (albeit a violent one), and to create a pool of expertise which could be called upon to help in terrorist attacks around the world. There is little doubt that Bin Laden plays an important role in sustaining this network - through funding, training, contacts, and other things - but we should be careful to regard him as a symptom of the disease, not its cause.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Downey+Jr.,+Robert\">Robert Downey Jr</a>, who is facing renewed drug charges that could land him back in prison, has been dropped from his comeback film, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0265029\">America's Sweethearts</a>.</p> <p>The co-producer of the film, Tom Sherak, has confirmed that it is: \"definite that we're out looking for somebody\" to fill Downey Jr's shoes when production begins in January.</p> <p>As reported yesterday, Downey Jr checked himself into Cedars Sinai Medical Centre suffering from depression after he was arrested over the Thanksgiving weekend for the possession of drugs. He is due to appear in court on December 27 but it seems that the producers of America's Sweethearts, which also stars <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Roberts,+Julia\">Julia Roberts</a> and <a href=\"/Film/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,81094,00.html\">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, fear the troubled star will return to prison. Sherak told <a href=\" http://www.usatoday.com/\">USA Today</a>: \"We need to move forward with this, and we're not sure what's going to happen on December 27.\"</p> <p>Other reports suggest that the reason Downey Jr has been dropped from the cast is that he is now uninsurable. If he is found guilty, the Chaplin actor could return to prison for six years.</p> <p>The story comes out amid reports in <a href=\"http://people.aol.com/people/\">People magazine</a> today that Downey Jr fell off the wagon well before his arrest over the Thanksgiving Weekend. The Magazine quotes an unnamed friend of Downey Jr's ex wife who said the actor: \"has been getting loaded on and off\" since he got out of prison in August. The report also claims that two weeks before his arrest, the 35-year-old actor left his seven-year-old son with an assistant in the middle of the night so he could score drugs. Downey Jr's publicist, Alan Nierob, denies the allegations.</p> <p>The actor, out on bail after his arrest, is currently finishing off work on his 10-week stint on the TV Show Ally McBeal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Robert Downey Jr, who is facing renewed drug charges that could land him back in prison, has been dropped from his comeback film, America's Sweethearts. The co-producer of the film, Tom Sherak, has confirmed that it is: \"definite that we're out looking for somebody\" to fill Downey Jr's shoes when production begins in January. As reported yesterday, Downey Jr checked himself into Cedars Sinai Medical Centre suffering from depression after he was arrested over the Thanksgiving weekend for the possession of drugs. He is due to appear in court on December 27 but it seems that the producers of America's Sweethearts, which also stars Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones, fear the troubled star will return to prison. Sherak told USA Today: \"We need to move forward with this, and we're not sure what's going to happen on December 27.\" Other reports suggest that the reason Downey Jr has been dropped from the cast is that he is now uninsurable. If he is found guilty, the Chaplin actor could return to prison for six years. The story comes out amid reports in People magazine today that Downey Jr fell off the wagon well before his arrest over the Thanksgiving Weekend. The Magazine quotes an unnamed friend of Downey Jr's ex wife who said the actor: \"has been getting loaded on and off\" since he got out of prison in August. The report also claims that two weeks before his arrest, the 35-year-old actor left his seven-year-old son with an assistant in the middle of the night so he could score drugs. Downey Jr's publicist, Alan Nierob, denies the allegations. The actor, out on bail after his arrest, is currently finishing off work on his 10-week stint on the TV Show Ally McBeal.",

      "body": "<p>Backstage at the St Martin's Theatre in London, there is a canvas- covered drum. It stands waist-high, mounted in a wooden frame, immediately behind the set of the Mousetrap. The canvas is a little frayed, and the top of the frame has a curious worn-down smoothness, a slight oiliness to the touch. </p> <p>For at least half an hour every night except Sundays, and on every Tuesday and Saturday afternoon since 1952, a lightly sweating hand has gripped this wood while another has vigorously spun the drum against the canvas. A crude but persistent whistling, the sound of a blizzard as imagined in cartoons and melodramas, has quavered across the stage and around the auditorium. The Mousetrap's wind machine has provided suitable accompaniment, claustrophobic yet cosy, to the murders and drawing room revelations of the longest-running play in the world. </p> <p>There is, however, a small cost. At the start of each show, the wind machine operators are fresh and fast. By the end of act one they are slowing, slumped over the drum frame. Imagine the shoulder twinges afterwards. Nobody at the theatre talks about installing a machine. </p> <p>A week tomorrow, the pared-down, patched-together theatrical treadmill that is The Mousetrap is to give its 20,000th performance. Next year, assuming it continues its run, will be the play's 50th year of continuous production. A long time ago, it ceased being an adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's slighter works and became something else: a record-breaker, a curiosity, a fixture for tourists, an ambiguous example of infinite success. To a certain sort of theatre-goer or stage professional, the Mousetrap is heaven - a fragment from a lost dramatic age of polite dialogue and sets with floral sofas. To lots of other people - fans of new drama, most critics - the play is a glimpse of hell. Every year, every ageing line is spoken without alteration. Every year, a coveted venue in England's theatrical heartland is unavailable for anything else. </p> <p>Yet complaining seems worse than pointless; all publicity, like each additional show, makes The Mousetrap more of an institution, provides more reasons to see it beyond two hours of Detective Sergeant Trotter's investigations at \"snowbound Monkswell Manor\". Disrespectful critics seem condemned, with each passing anniversary, to revisit The Mousetrap and try to close it. At least one has been trying since the early 70s. </p> <p>The pinky-red neon of The Mousetrap sign glows day and night from a dark side street, perfectly positioned for tourists, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden. The sign is so vast and bright, with \"49th Year\" in slightly larger figures than \"Agatha Christie\", that you barely take in the small cream theatre behind it. Next door to the most secure theatrical employer in the country are the offices of the actors' union, Equity. </p> <p>Inside the St Martin's, the foyer is shallow and draughty. There is a worn crimson carpet, slightly chipped panelling, and carefully polished brass. A wooden scoreboard with moveable painted numbers to announce the number of shows so far, like something from an old cricket ground, occupies most of one wall. A dusty Mousetrap sweatshirt (\u00a315) is pinned up next to the Mousetrap postcards (collages of old tickets, anniversary badges and cast members), and Mousetrap mousemats, already commemorating \"November 2002: 50th Anniversary\". </p> <p>Ticket sales recently have been a bit slow, though. In the box office, which is occupied by two women with patient smiles, they blame the trains. On non-matinee afternoons, the phones only require attention sporadically. The odd wrapped-up tourist bustles in from the street. A Dutch couple want to know how long the play is. An American man wants \"the best seat you have\". Otherwise, near-silence: small coughs from the box office, snatches of mobile phone calls from the pavement outside, a homeless man staring in as he drags his sleeping bag past. </p> <p>Staff conversations at St Martin's have a slightly ritual quality. </p> <p>\"Are we busier?\" asks an usher, coming in to work. </p> <p>\"No. No,\" says one of the women in the box office. </p> <p>\"It'll pick up,\" says the usher. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes,\" says the woman. Then they start discussing the size of the new advertising boards outside. </p> <p>These days, the theatre's non-acting employees, contrary to Mousetrap tradition, tend to be temporary and young. Lopez and Lovatto are two of the names on the staff rota. Among the framed Mousetrap cartoons from long-gone English newspapers in the circle bar, there is staff gossip in Spanish. One of the ushers reads scripts up there. A measure of cynicism seems to prevail: \"The sole objective of most people working in the building,\" says one, \"Is to get out of the building as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>David Turner, the director, comes in around 11am. \"I'm not often here of an evening,\" he says quite casually, solid and jolly in green tweeds. He lives on the Sussex coast. \"People say to me, 'Do you watch it every week?'\" His eyes light with stage-incredulity: \"I'd go potty!\" </p> <p>But, as among his subordinates, irreverence can conceal a certain dependence. Turner first directed The Mousetrap in 1987; he has continued for much longer than any of his 19 predecessors. \"When I first came here,\" he says, slightly out of breath on the twisting climb up to his attic office, \"the stairs weren't a problem.\" Before the St Martin's, he was director of the Connaught Theatre in sleepy Worthing, trying to freshen up The King and I and The Sound of Music. When the call to the St Martin's came, \"I was over the moon.\" </p> <p>Turner's tiny office window opens directly above the neon Mousetrap logo. \"I love the play,\" he says with feeling. \"It's not Chekhov and it's not Shakespeare. But it's very subtle . . . I wander round the audience, and I love to hear them talking about it. I follow Americans up the stairs afterwards.\" He looks as happy as Billy Bunter: \"Agatha Christie liked everyone to go on their way rejoicing.\" </p> <p>On top of his immaculate filing cabinets, next to all his correspondence as Mousetrap curator with ladies in Norfolk and North America, is a pile of sheets logging every performance. \"Last night was one hour fifty-nine and a half minutes,\" he says without looking. There is a column for curtain calls (seven on the first night in London in November 1952, fewer thereafter) and on-stage accidents (\"lampshade on wall bracket above radio dislodged by Mr Ralston's door slam in Act II\"). But Turner's most precious archival item is a tattered blue paperback, which he eases out of a plastic bag like a hoarded bar of gold. It is the very first version of the script, complete with an opening scene later removed and never performed: </p> <p>\"A London street on a foggy day. Two workmen are sitting by a charcoal brazier. </p> <p>Bill: Wireless says it's going to snow. </p> <p>Alf: It's cold enough for it. </p> <p>Bill: Perishing cold. </p> <p>Alf: Expect there'll be a lot of accidents in this fog . . .\" </p> <p>The Mousetrap's origins seem as dusty as its language now. It was written in 1947 as a half-hour BBC radio play titled Three Blind Mice, an 80th birthday present for Queen Mary. Agatha Christie, who called herself \"a perfect sausage machine\", then stuffed it with jokes and additional characters into a stage play four times that length, which opened in Nottingham in October 1952 and briefly toured the midlands and the north of England. Christie thought the play might last six months. </p> <p>The involvement of Richard Attenborough as Sergeant Trotter made The Mousetrap a success in London for two years, but when he left in 1955, the takings plummeted. The theatre gave the production notice to quit, and a new lease was only negotiated on condition that a new play would take The Mousetrap's place. </p> <p>It was then, though, that what you might call the Mousetrap Effect first occurred: the moment news of its imminent closure got out, people crowded in to catch a performance while they still could. \"If we put a notice up now saying 'closing month',\" says Turner , \"we'd probably be busy for two decades.\" </p> <p>In 1958, The Mousetrap became the longest-running British play ever. By the mid-70s, it was the longest-running in the world. In 1977, the beleaguered prime minister, Jim Callaghan, was persuaded to attend the 25th anniversary celebrations. \"Alas, I have little time to go to the theatre,\" he wrote on a card, still framed in the foyer. \"I would like to come and see your play sometime during the next 25 years.\" </p> <p>It remains a singular experience. First, there is the wait in the foyer: a small heat from the radiators, the toilets locked until half an hour before, the rest of the theatre roped off like a stately home. The ushers are transformed, erect at their stations, hands behind their backs, in waistcoats or new Mousetrap sweatshirts, pony tails scraped back. The audience, for the sparsely attended shows early in the week, appear to be deliberately seated in clusters. But once inside the dark-wood auditorium, the empty rows seem not to matter. The lighting is dim and warm. Introductory piano music tinkles. Couples gulp down gin and tonics in the snug bars and giggle conspiratorially. </p> <p>The play creaks comfortably along. Lines are bellowed. Clues are given with emphasis. Poses are struck and held for whole minutes. A revolver is produced at the climax, and then, once all has been resolved, there is a reconciliation scene involving a hat box from Harrods. The oohs from the stalls are the loudest of the evening. Afterwards, it feels like the satisfactory completion of another episode of a long-running game show. The men in the audience say, \"I told you so.\" </p> <p>It is probably unwise to condemn or romanticise it all. Before Tuesday's matinee, in the dressing room always given to the actor playing Trotter, a keen young man called Alan Freestone says: \"This means I can buy a flat.\" He has not had a West End job before. He says his agent was in the play 25 years ago. </p> <p>There is a letter from the theatre's management on his dressing table. Like the rest of the cast, which is completely changed annually, he is informed that the celebrations attending the 20,000th performance have \"very specific public relations objectives\". The actors will have only limited access.</p>",

In time, once he's settled on the shape he wants, he'll spend a lot of time coaching and organising. He'll put new ideas in people's minds and do a lot of work on set plays, particularly attacking wise, because he's always done that. It was one of his great strengths with England. </p> <p>When everything has settled I think it would do Robbo good to take three weeks in the sun. He looks battle-worn. He's gone out front and taken most of it on the chin and in many ways a lot of the players have hidden behind him. </p> <p>But I don't go along with the idea that Terry's arrival has undermined Bryan. To me it shows how open-minded and brave Robbo is, and how much he's got Middlesbrough at heart, that he'll step aside for someone who in his view is the best. People say, \"What about when he has to step up again?\" but six months down the line doesn't matter.

      "body": "<p>Rangers were tossed out of Europe in humiliating fashion yesterday, capitulating before Kaiserslautern and their raucous supporters who filled this stadium to its rafters. </p> <p>Both the game and his tactical plan imploded before the eyes of Dick Advocaat, the Rangers manager, as Kaiserslautern sliced at will through a flat-footed defence. </p> <p>With Rangers trailing at the break, Advocaat sent out a re-cast unit in the second half with the intention of aggressively taking this game to the home side and building on Rangers' 1-0 win in Glasgow. The script, though, began to smoulder the moment Youri Djorkaeff cleverly released Andreas Buck on goal and he calmly advanced on Stefan Klos before prodding the ball home. </p> <p>Vratislav Lokvenc, Kaiserslautern's towering Czech, added a third in the 78th minute as Rangers disintegrated; Klos, indeed, saved them at least twice in the dying minutes as German attackers marauded towards him. </p> <p>How different it could have been had Rangers converted just one of the three good chances that fell to them in the opening 45 minutes. There was scarcely a period when this match was comfortably in their grasp, yet the arithmetic of home and away in Europe meant one goal scored by the Scottish champions would have put enormous pressure on the Germans. Neither J\u00f6rg Albertz nor poor Kenny Miller, twice, could pull off the deed. </p> <p>\"We have no excuses - Kaiserslautern were the better team and deserved to go through,\" said Advocaat afterwards. \"I think we had maybe five or six chances overall in this game, on top of the many we created at Ibrox in the first game, and we failed to take them. At this level of European football, if you do that, you lose.\" </p> <p>Most glaring of Rangers' worries was their dependence on the raw Miller, who, at 20, may be an exciting prospect but is still dreadfully unprepared for these nervous forays into Europe. </p> <p>Miller whacked two good chances high over Georg Koch's bar before hobbling around for the rest of the first half and then being replaced by Michael Mols. </p> <p>It was probably Advocaat's insistence on Rangers needing 11 fit men \"for a physical battle\" that made him leave two of his Dutch infantry - Mols and Ronald de Boer - on the bench. Mols confessed this week that he might spend the rest of his career playing parts of matches, and De Boer, in true Rangers fashion, arrived from Barcelona with an injury. </p> <p>Yet Mols, from the moment he arrived, defied the prognosis on his knee and gave Rangers immediate presence. He twisted, turned and opened angles through which Rangers might attack; they did with scant reward. </p> <p>In the combustible atmosphere, Rangers toiled to recover from a goal conceded criminally early.

      "bodyText": "Rangers were tossed out of Europe in humiliating fashion yesterday, capitulating before Kaiserslautern and their raucous supporters who filled this stadium to its rafters. Both the game and his tactical plan imploded before the eyes of Dick Advocaat, the Rangers manager, as Kaiserslautern sliced at will through a flat-footed defence. With Rangers trailing at the break, Advocaat sent out a re-cast unit in the second half with the intention of aggressively taking this game to the home side and building on Rangers' 1-0 win in Glasgow. The script, though, began to smoulder the moment Youri Djorkaeff cleverly released Andreas Buck on goal and he calmly advanced on Stefan Klos before prodding the ball home. Vratislav Lokvenc, Kaiserslautern's towering Czech, added a third in the 78th minute as Rangers disintegrated; Klos, indeed, saved them at least twice in the dying minutes as German attackers marauded towards him. How different it could have been had Rangers converted just one of the three good chances that fell to them in the opening 45 minutes. There was scarcely a period when this match was comfortably in their grasp, yet the arithmetic of home and away in Europe meant one goal scored by the Scottish champions would have put enormous pressure on the Germans. Neither J\u00f6rg Albertz nor poor Kenny Miller, twice, could pull off the deed. \"We have no excuses - Kaiserslautern were the better team and deserved to go through,\" said Advocaat afterwards. \"I think we had maybe five or six chances overall in this game, on top of the many we created at Ibrox in the first game, and we failed to take them. At this level of European football, if you do that, you lose.\" Most glaring of Rangers' worries was their dependence on the raw Miller, who, at 20, may be an exciting prospect but is still dreadfully unprepared for these nervous forays into Europe. Miller whacked two good chances high over Georg Koch's bar before hobbling around for the rest of the first half and then being replaced by Michael Mols. It was probably Advocaat's insistence on Rangers needing 11 fit men \"for a physical battle\" that made him leave two of his Dutch infantry - Mols and Ronald de Boer - on the bench. Mols confessed this week that he might spend the rest of his career playing parts of matches, and De Boer, in true Rangers fashion, arrived from Barcelona with an injury. Yet Mols, from the moment he arrived, defied the prognosis on his knee and gave Rangers immediate presence. He twisted, turned and opened angles through which Rangers might attack; they did with scant reward. In the combustible atmosphere, Rangers toiled to recover from a goal conceded criminally early. Kaiserslautern's clever passing was already making Rangers giddy before Miroslav Klose, their prized young striker, burst into the box with Scott Wilson wobbling in front of him. With the defender falling over, Klose prodded a shot which became airborne and flew past the startled Klos. Buck's strike in the 63rd minute was a beautiful creation by Djorkaeff, confounding Rangers' offside trap. The third from Lokvenc 12 minutes from time was a downward header past a hacked-off Klos. Kaiserslautern (3-4-1-2): G Koch; H Koch, Yakin, Ramzy; Buck, Hristov (Basler, 87min), Komljenovic (Strasser, 3), Grammozis; Djorkaeff; Klose (Marschall, 69), Lokvenc. Rangers (3-5-2): Klos; Wilson, Konterman, Amoruso; Ricksen (McCann, h-t), Reyna, Tugay (Dodds, 76), Albertz, Numan; Wallace, Miller (Mols, h-t). Referee: K E Fisker (Denmark).",

But this, in turn, is precisely why Texas congressman Tom DeLay's press interviews this week have been so intriguing.</p> <p>Because either Mr DeLay or Mr Bush is heading for a fall.</p> <p>Mr DeLay, the Republican majority whip in the House of Representatives, is probably the most powerful politician on Capitol Hill today.</p> <p>But you would not know that from the negligible amount of publicity that the congressman from Houston attracted during the election campaign.</p> <p>Mr DeLay, who, with Newt Gingrich, was the principal architect of the Clinton impeachment drive, has been kept strictly out of sight from August to November, content to raise funds and consolidate alliances, skills of which he is a master.</p> <p>This week, however, he came out into the open, with a series of remarks that amount to a declaration of war - not just on the Democrats, but on almost everything that Mr Bush has been saying.</p> <p>\"You're going to think I'm crazy,\" Mr DeLay said this week, \"but I didn't see this as a tie election. This is something I've been working for for 22 years.</p> <p>\"I mean, we got it. The Republicans are the majority party in this country.\"</p> <p>From where Mr DeLay sits, the results on November 7 were not a triple stand-off but a hat-trick of Republican wins.</p> <p>You will hear no talk from Mr DeLay about politicians of good will getting together. What you will hear is the triumphalism of a man who believes that the operative word in the phrase \"narrow majority\" is majority, not narrow.</p> <p>\"We have the House, we have the Senate, we have the White House, which means we have the agenda,\" Mr DeLay announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>He could hardly have put it more clearly than that. But, just in case there might be someone who detected a note of bipartisan backsliding, Mr DeLay then underscored his point.</p> <p>\"We'll act exactly the same way as we have been. We'll write conservative bills and ask the Democrats to participate,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The things we've been dreaming about we can now do.\"</p> <p>Two of Mr DeLay's closest allies struck the same note.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush's transition team has adopted \"bringing America together\" as its slogan, and not a day now passes without Mr Bush or one of his surrogates talking about the need to \"reach out\" to Al Gore's supporters. Having campaigned before election day as \"a uniter not a divider\", Mr Bush is making it clear that he intends to present himself to the American people as a conciliatory leader. He will be a man who is ready to work with the Democrats in a new and bipartisan spirit in the evenly divided political environment that has been created by the 2000 election. That, at least, is what Mr Bush would have you believe. But this, in turn, is precisely why Texas congressman Tom DeLay's press interviews this week have been so intriguing. Because either Mr DeLay or Mr Bush is heading for a fall. Mr DeLay, the Republican majority whip in the House of Representatives, is probably the most powerful politician on Capitol Hill today. But you would not know that from the negligible amount of publicity that the congressman from Houston attracted during the election campaign. Mr DeLay, who, with Newt Gingrich, was the principal architect of the Clinton impeachment drive, has been kept strictly out of sight from August to November, content to raise funds and consolidate alliances, skills of which he is a master. This week, however, he came out into the open, with a series of remarks that amount to a declaration of war - not just on the Democrats, but on almost everything that Mr Bush has been saying. \"You're going to think I'm crazy,\" Mr DeLay said this week, \"but I didn't see this as a tie election. This is something I've been working for for 22 years. \"I mean, we got it. The Republicans are the majority party in this country.\" From where Mr DeLay sits, the results on November 7 were not a triple stand-off but a hat-trick of Republican wins. You will hear no talk from Mr DeLay about politicians of good will getting together. What you will hear is the triumphalism of a man who believes that the operative word in the phrase \"narrow majority\" is majority, not narrow. \"We have the House, we have the Senate, we have the White House, which means we have the agenda,\" Mr DeLay announced on Wednesday. He could hardly have put it more clearly than that. But, just in case there might be someone who detected a note of bipartisan backsliding, Mr DeLay then underscored his point. \"We'll act exactly the same way as we have been. We'll write conservative bills and ask the Democrats to participate,\" he said. \"The things we've been dreaming about we can now do.\" Two of Mr DeLay's closest allies struck the same note. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas announced on Tuesday that Republicans now had the opportunity they have been seeking for half a century. Congressman John Doolittle of California described the party's position as \"awesome\", and announced that the moment had arrived to implement \"the rest of the Contract with America\" - in other words, the Newt Gingrich deregulatory agenda of 1994. If there are still people out there who think that it is going to make no difference whether Mr Bush or Al Gore ends up as Bill Clinton's successor, then they should look at the legislative priorities that Mr DeLay has set out for a Bush administration. Mr DeLay's priorities are to cut personal and corporate taxes, remove consumers' right to sue large corporations and reduce the size of the federal government while expanding the armed forces budget. He also wants to ban so-called \"partial birth\" abortions, and rally the party against any measures to reform campaign finance laws or introduce tighter gun controls. Some of this is bravado, of course, but don't ever think that Mr DeLay is not serious. Not only that. No one in US politics, with the exception of Mr Bush, is in a stronger position to set the agenda right now than Mr DeLay. The question of the moment is this: which Texas Republican is going to be the winner and which the loser? Because they can't both be telling the truth.

      "bodyText": "Scottish TV company SMG has pre-empted next week's communications white paper by making a move for rival broadcaster Scottish Radio Holdings. Scottish Media Group has taken a 14.9% stake in SRH, owner of the Radio Clyde and Radio Forth stations, in anticipation of a relaxation of radio ownership rules. SMG said: \"The UK media sector continues to evolve through developments such as the promised communications white paper. \"SMG intends to be a leading player in any consolidation of UK media and believes that this investment positions it well until the implications of the new legislation are clear.\" Culture secretary Chris Smith is next week expected to announce a change in the current \"points system\" of radio ownership. The key players in the UK commercial radio industry are keen to reduce the number of independent companies from 12 to three, allowing the likes of SMG, Capital Radio, GWR and Emap to launch acquisition sprees. SMG owns Virgin Radio and is keen to build up its Scottish portfolio if the white paper allows operators to increase their share of the radio audience. SRH has had a bumper year, reporting record profits of \u00a320m on turnover of over \u00a370m. Rumours have circulated the City for some time that SMG would make a move on SRH, but the company denied any intent to significantly increase its holding. SMG said it has \"no current intention of making an offer for the whole of SRH\". As the holder of the Scottish Television and Grampian ITV franchises, SMG is the sixth largest TV programme maker in Britain. It also owns the Herald and Evening News newspapers. SMG's shares shot up 7.9%, or 22p, to 261p on the news, with some analysts predicting a possible merger between the two companies. The publication of next week's white paper is likely to spur merger and acquisition activity in the media sector, as ownership rules are likely to be relaxed across the board. Radio companies have been vocal in their demands for a change to the present system.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Burton is excited. The 33-year-old from Stockton-on-Tees is sitting in his office at Oracle's gleaming Silicon Valley headquarters, demonstrating his latest toy, Blackberry, a tiny device that allows users to access their company email wherever and whenever they want. </p> <p>It is the latest must-have accessory for every executive who wants to stay connected and Mr Burton could not be happier. \"I only set it up last night but already I'm addicted. I sent my secretary an email from the car on the way into work this morning and she couldn't work out how it was getting to her. It's brilliant.\" </p> <p>Mr Burton started out answering the phones at Oracle's customer help centre in Guildford, Surrey, in 1993. Five years ago, after a promotion to the marketing department, he travelled to Oracle's global headquarters at Redwood Shores, about 15 miles south of San Francisco, to help with a product demonstration. He has been there ever since. </p> <p>Today he is a senior vice president, responsible for the global marketing of Oracle's software products, manages a team of 160 people and drives a Porsche. </p> <p>As a Brit Mr Burton used to be a rarity here but California's internet revolution, like the gold rush before it, is attracting thousands of immigrants every year. An increasing number are Brits chasing dreams and fortunes, determined to play a part in an era many say will go down in history as the second industrial revolution. </p> <p>Mr Burton could retire tomorrow if he cashed in his share options. Yet he typically spends 12 hours a day in his office six days a week and puts in another two or three hours when he gets home. Last year he racked up 200,000 business miles. </p> <p>\"I love it. Working here is totally unlike working in England. My grandfather was a coal miner, my dad ran the local unemployment office in Stockton, I speak with a northern accent and went to the local comprehensive but no one cares. All they want to know here is whether I can get the job done. </p> <p>\"You work long hours but it's an incredible buzz. When I give presentations there can be 4,000 people in the audience. That's more than Hartlepool United get for a home game.\" </p> <p>Pilgrims expecting glamour and beauty to go with the latest technology and the sunshine will be disappointed, however. Silicon Valley has no heart, neither physi cally nor metaphorically. It stretches from San Francisco down Highway 101 past Redwood City, Menlo Park and Palo Alto to San Jose about 40 miles to the south. </p> <p>Some say its spiritual centre is Palo Alto where Bill Hewlett and David Packard founded the computer firm Hewlett-Packard in a garage in 1939. Others say it is the University of Stanford, whose labs have supplied start-ups that now account for 60% of the revenues in the valley. </p> <p>Until the late 1960s the area was known as the Valley of the Heart's Delight. Apricot and plum orchards were the region's main revenue generators. Today those groves have been replaced by mile upon mile of soulless business parks that are home to the likes of Oracle, Cisco, Netscape, Yahoo! HP and Sun Microsystems. Glance in a copy of the San Jose local weekly paper and you will find a news section dominated by stories about San Francisco, a thin arts section and page upon page of advertisements for cosmetic improvement, four-wheel drives and three-bedroom bungalows with prices starting at $500,000. </p> <p>Woodside, where thoroughbred horses graze in the paddocks of ranch-like homes, is where Oracle's Larry Ellison and Cisco's John Chambers live. </p> <p>Sandhill Road, where the big venture capital firms congregate, oozes wealth and power. In the third quarter alone an area a little over two square miles handed out a record $6.6bn, more than a third of all venture funds invested in the US. </p> <p>Residents throughout the region have to cope with some of the highest house prices and worst traffic problems in the US. Rush hour on the 101 seems to last all day, commutes are getting longer and public transport is almost non-existent. </p> <p>Yet still they flock here, armed with a business plan and a dream..Many find the valley culture totally alien when they arrive. \"Spend \u00a31m on property in Stockton and you'd get a whole street but here you'll only get a reasonable place - you won't get a mansion,\" Mr Burton says. </p> <p>\"Yes, you miss the silly things. Match of the Day, sipping oxtail soup while watching Middlesbrough get beat 2-0 on Boxing day, the pub culture, the cynicism, the sense of humour.\" </p> <p>Corporate pride is a big thing. In the canteen at Commtouch, an email outsourcing specialist, staff munch on free lunches and play table football below garish posters plugging the employee referral scheme: Earn cash rewards or a weekend in Mexico each time you persuade a friend to come and work at Commtouch. </p> <p>There is a dry cleaning service, regular company barbecues for all the family and a golf course behind the car park. And, of course, everyone is given stock options. </p> <p>\"Companies treat their staff well here because they know that if they don't someone else will,\" says Isabel Maxwell, president of Commtouch. A Brit and one of the valley's highest-profile entrepreneurs, she has reason to be thankful for the lack of interest in people's backgrounds: she is the daughter of disgraced publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. </p> <p>For all the talk of meritocracy and equality, female executives of Ms Maxwell's seniority are still a rarity and an MBA or M Eng from Stanford or Harvard is still far more likely to get you in the door. </p> <p>Silicon Valley fosters innovation and entrepreneurs unlike anywhere else in the world. Those that have been here a while say the high tolerance of risk, vast quantities of venture capital, a large skilled workforce and a desire to execute on business plans at unmatched speeds make it a compelling location to start a business. </p> <p>Nick Denton, 34, co-founded Moreover.com, a service that aggregates news from across the net, in London in 1998. He says Moreover had to open an office on the west coast if its global ambitions were to be taken seriously. \"San Francisco is the capital of the internet world and you have to have an embassy here.\" </p> <p>Moreover is one of the lucky ones. Of every 100 hopefuls like it, 99 are dispatched empty handed. Of those that gain funding, only 10% survive. </p> <p>Mr Denton heads the US operation and a 20 strong staff of Brits, Latvians, Hungarians, Canadians and Americans. Moreover's office, in an area previously populated by seedy night clubs and warehouses, is a model dot.com start-up: an open-plan fifth-floor loft space packed with flashy laptops and the requisite table football. </p> <p>\"All high-technology companies, regardless of location, will be required one way or another to maintain a presence here,\" agrees Wilf Corrigan, a Liver pudlian who founded semiconductor firm LSI Logic in the early 80s and is now a billionaire. \"Silicon Valley will continue to be the place which other states and other countries will try to emulate.\" </p> <p>Entrepreneurs come to the valley to \"breathe the internet\", says Mr Denton. \"You can learn more from going to a party here than you can from spending a week at a conference in Europe. Venture capital firms in the valley offer a totally different quality of money than in Europe.\" </p> <p>San Francisco's obsession with the internet is as offputting for some as it is inspiring and addictive for others. In the run-up to the US presidential election, Gore, Bush and Washington politics rarely rated a mention on the social circuit. </p> <p>Some of the Brits stick together. Mr Denton shares a house with Adam Gold, vice president of finance at UK-founded start-up Obongo. They were two of the original team behind First Tuesday and have replicated the cocktail party-cum- networking idea in San Francisco with a monthly event for expats called Eurotrash. </p> <p>Another favourite hangout is a pub called The Mad Dog in the Fog, largely because it shows British football live on a big screen. \"You can go in there at 4am on a Saturday and find groups of lads drinking pints, eating fry-ups and watching Man U v Leeds live from Old Trafford,\" says Dominic Johnson, marketing director of intelligent software firm Autonomy, which has headquarters in San Francisco and Cambridge. </p> <p>Much about San Francisco is upside-down. Floor space in the district where Moreover is based is now more expensive than the financial district where big players such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have offices. </p> <p>Veterans of the valley say it is losing some of pioneer-days purity. Twenty-something graduates with no working experience can demand \"ridiculous\" salary and share option packages, Ms Maxwell says. </p> <p>Share prices are monitored feverishly. Mike Mortiz, a Cardiff-born partner at Sequoia, the venture capital firm that gave Yahoo! and Cisco their first funding, says the market sell-off has been beneficial. \"There is a sense that the tourist season in Silicon Valley is ending. The bankers and consultants are scuttling back to where they came from.\" </p> <p>Exhausted programmers pulling all-nighters at the big firms remain resolutely upbeat, deaming not of a place in history but of early retirement. </p> <p>\"When that stock hits $120 I'm gone,\" one engineer at Cisco admitted. \"Some want four or five million [dollars] before they retire. Me, I'm happy to take less. All me and my wife want is a place in the hills and money to travel comfortably.\" </p> <p>He may have some time to wait, however. Cisco shares were trading yesterday in New York at just over $50.</p>",

Five years ago, after a promotion to the marketing department, he travelled to Oracle's global headquarters at Redwood Shores, about 15 miles south of San Francisco, to help with a product demonstration. He has been there ever since. Today he is a senior vice president, responsible for the global marketing of Oracle's software products, manages a team of 160 people and drives a Porsche. As a Brit Mr Burton used to be a rarity here but California's internet revolution, like the gold rush before it, is attracting thousands of immigrants every year. An increasing number are Brits chasing dreams and fortunes, determined to play a part in an era many say will go down in history as the second industrial revolution. Mr Burton could retire tomorrow if he cashed in his share options. Yet he typically spends 12 hours a day in his office six days a week and puts in another two or three hours when he gets home. Last year he racked up 200,000 business miles. \"I love it. Working here is totally unlike working in England. My grandfather was a coal miner, my dad ran the local unemployment office in Stockton, I speak with a northern accent and went to the local comprehensive but no one cares. All they want to know here is whether I can get the job done. \"You work long hours but it's an incredible buzz. When I give presentations there can be 4,000 people in the audience. That's more than Hartlepool United get for a home game.\" Pilgrims expecting glamour and beauty to go with the latest technology and the sunshine will be disappointed, however. Silicon Valley has no heart, neither physi cally nor metaphorically. It stretches from San Francisco down Highway 101 past Redwood City, Menlo Park and Palo Alto to San Jose about 40 miles to the south. Some say its spiritual centre is Palo Alto where Bill Hewlett and David Packard founded the computer firm Hewlett-Packard in a garage in 1939. Others say it is the University of Stanford, whose labs have supplied start-ups that now account for 60% of the revenues in the valley. Until the late 1960s the area was known as the Valley of the Heart's Delight. Apricot and plum orchards were the region's main revenue generators. Today those groves have been replaced by mile upon mile of soulless business parks that are home to the likes of Oracle, Cisco, Netscape, Yahoo! HP and Sun Microsystems. Glance in a copy of the San Jose local weekly paper and you will find a news section dominated by stories about San Francisco, a thin arts section and page upon page of advertisements for cosmetic improvement, four-wheel drives and three-bedroom bungalows with prices starting at $500,000. Woodside, where thoroughbred horses graze in the paddocks of ranch-like homes, is where Oracle's Larry Ellison and Cisco's John Chambers live. Sandhill Road, where the big venture capital firms congregate, oozes wealth and power. In the third quarter alone an area a little over two square miles handed out a record $6.6bn, more than a third of all venture funds invested in the US. Residents throughout the region have to cope with some of the highest house prices and worst traffic problems in the US. Rush hour on the 101 seems to last all day, commutes are getting longer and public transport is almost non-existent. Yet still they flock here, armed with a business plan and a dream..Many find the valley culture totally alien when they arrive. \"Spend \u00a31m on property in Stockton and you'd get a whole street but here you'll only get a reasonable place - you won't get a mansion,\" Mr Burton says. \"Yes, you miss the silly things. Match of the Day, sipping oxtail soup while watching Middlesbrough get beat 2-0 on Boxing day, the pub culture, the cynicism, the sense of humour.\" Corporate pride is a big thing. In the canteen at Commtouch, an email outsourcing specialist, staff munch on free lunches and play table football below garish posters plugging the employee referral scheme: Earn cash rewards or a weekend in Mexico each time you persuade a friend to come and work at Commtouch. There is a dry cleaning service, regular company barbecues for all the family and a golf course behind the car park. And, of course, everyone is given stock options. \"Companies treat their staff well here because they know that if they don't someone else will,\" says Isabel Maxwell, president of Commtouch. A Brit and one of the valley's highest-profile entrepreneurs, she has reason to be thankful for the lack of interest in people's backgrounds: she is the daughter of disgraced publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. For all the talk of meritocracy and equality, female executives of Ms Maxwell's seniority are still a rarity and an MBA or M Eng from Stanford or Harvard is still far more likely to get you in the door. Silicon Valley fosters innovation and entrepreneurs unlike anywhere else in the world. Those that have been here a while say the high tolerance of risk, vast quantities of venture capital, a large skilled workforce and a desire to execute on business plans at unmatched speeds make it a compelling location to start a business. Nick Denton, 34, co-founded Moreover.com, a service that aggregates news from across the net, in London in 1998. He says Moreover had to open an office on the west coast if its global ambitions were to be taken seriously. \"San Francisco is the capital of the internet world and you have to have an embassy here.\" Moreover is one of the lucky ones. Of every 100 hopefuls like it, 99 are dispatched empty handed. Of those that gain funding, only 10% survive. Mr Denton heads the US operation and a 20 strong staff of Brits, Latvians, Hungarians, Canadians and Americans. Moreover's office, in an area previously populated by seedy night clubs and warehouses, is a model dot.com start-up: an open-plan fifth-floor loft space packed with flashy laptops and the requisite table football. \"All high-technology companies, regardless of location, will be required one way or another to maintain a presence here,\" agrees Wilf Corrigan, a Liver pudlian who founded semiconductor firm LSI Logic in the early 80s and is now a billionaire. \"Silicon Valley will continue to be the place which other states and other countries will try to emulate.\" Entrepreneurs come to the valley to \"breathe the internet\", says Mr Denton. \"You can learn more from going to a party here than you can from spending a week at a conference in Europe. Venture capital firms in the valley offer a totally different quality of money than in Europe.\" San Francisco's obsession with the internet is as offputting for some as it is inspiring and addictive for others. In the run-up to the US presidential election, Gore, Bush and Washington politics rarely rated a mention on the social circuit. Some of the Brits stick together. Mr Denton shares a house with Adam Gold, vice president of finance at UK-founded start-up Obongo. They were two of the original team behind First Tuesday and have replicated the cocktail party-cum- networking idea in San Francisco with a monthly event for expats called Eurotrash. Another favourite hangout is a pub called The Mad Dog in the Fog, largely because it shows British football live on a big screen. \"You can go in there at 4am on a Saturday and find groups of lads drinking pints, eating fry-ups and watching Man U v Leeds live from Old Trafford,\" says Dominic Johnson, marketing director of intelligent software firm Autonomy, which has headquarters in San Francisco and Cambridge. Much about San Francisco is upside-down. Floor space in the district where Moreover is based is now more expensive than the financial district where big players such as Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have offices. Veterans of the valley say it is losing some of pioneer-days purity. Twenty-something graduates with no working experience can demand \"ridiculous\" salary and share option packages, Ms Maxwell says. Share prices are monitored feverishly. Mike Mortiz, a Cardiff-born partner at Sequoia, the venture capital firm that gave Yahoo! and Cisco their first funding, says the market sell-off has been beneficial. \"There is a sense that the tourist season in Silicon Valley is ending. The bankers and consultants are scuttling back to where they came from.\" Exhausted programmers pulling all-nighters at the big firms remain resolutely upbeat, deaming not of a place in history but of early retirement. \"When that stock hits $120 I'm gone,\" one engineer at Cisco admitted. \"Some want four or five million [dollars] before they retire. Me, I'm happy to take less. All me and my wife want is a place in the hills and money to travel comfortably.\" He may have some time to wait, however. Cisco shares were trading yesterday in New York at just over $50.",

Seven per cent of graduates now expect a \"golden hello\" payment and one in five who had received a job offer felt sufficiently confident to turn it down, according to the Guardian's Grad Facts 2000 survey in association with the Association of Graduate Recruiters. Work and quality of life balance rates highly, with 36% rating over 30 days' holiday as a more attractive benefit than a car or pension scheme. But while employers are being forced to meet graduates' high expectations in order to attract recruits, they can expect little company loyalty. One third of graduates do not anticipate staying with their first employer for more than a year or two. The survey of 2,000 final year university students shows that getting a good job and friends is rated more highly than sex or money in terms of graduates' personal interests. However, job satisfaction is still the main priority, with men more anxious than women about getting an excellent salary - 61% to 52% - while 36% of men are con cerned about a good social life, compared to 29% of women. Women (31%) were keener than men (19%) to have an inspirational boss or mentor. The survey also reveals that 51% of graduates said they would baulk at the prospect of having to perform a test when applying for certain jobs. Seventy per cent expected a starting salary of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a318,000, with over half hoping for at least \u00a314,000 but 8% expected to get over \u00a320,000.

It is one of the most flexible green papers ever written - full of possibility, but no certainty. Everything, says the Department of Trade and Industry, is out for consultation, so this rubber document can be bounced either way. Who shouts loudest wins - parents or the CBI? </p> <p>Next Thursday outside the DTI there will be a \"baby blockade\" with small children and big plastic toys and tractors to mimic the fuel protesters under the banner \"Does the government only listen to those with trucks?\" The demo is demanding better maternity pay, paid parental leave and the right to work flexible or part-time hours. </p> <p>Yesterday's green paper launch was a skilled operation. Briefers were out in force, telling one story to employers and another to the parental-rights campaigners. Stephen Byers started out dismally at the DTI: remember his \"wealth creation matters more than wealth redistribution\" and his attempt to sabotage part-time workers rights. He has come a long way since then but he is still trying to appease both sides. </p> <p>Last April he was briefing that there would definitely be a right to paid parental leave, (13 weeks spread over five years). Since then the CBI's Digby Jones has bullied and browbeaten with such success that no paid parental leave appears in this green paper. \"We were strongly against it,\" says the CBI. </p> <p>On the other hand the women in government fought hard too - and there are options in this green paper that could profoundly improve life for parents. Before the manifesto is written, Byers will have to declare which side he is on. Women MPs and ministers were busy sending out the message yesterday - \"Push him hard!\" Since the CBI is now the government's political enemy anyway, (having played strong cards with considerable stupidity), Byers might as well find favour with the women instead. </p> <p>One campaigning backbencher emerged from a DTI briefing saying \"Brilliant!\" Others were more circumspect. Britain's maternity and paternity rights are the worst in the EU and Byers agrees: \"The status quo is not an option.\" Mothers trying to return to work after having a baby have been treated cruelly until now - no childcare and low maternity pay for only 18 weeks. The wonder is that so many do manage to get back to work. </p> <p>Research by Harriet Harman for the clothing union KFAT, found women working in factories forced to return to work within weeks, describing an almost unbearable wrench. Nationally 25% of mothers go back to work well before their 18 weeks is over because they can't afford not to. Under the family-friendly Tories, maternity pay fell from 40% of average earnings to 20%, forcing poorer mothers back to work ever sooner. Now Labour will probably promise that the \u00a362 a week maternity pay will rise to \u00a3100 and possibly more, for the full 26 weeks. Mothers who can afford it can take a full year off, while fathers get two weeks paid paternity leave - a good gesture, long overdue. </p> <p>But one remarkable proposal could profoundly change the working habits of the entire nation. All mothers and fathers could get the right to reduced working hours for as long as they wish. It would be the first genuine attempt to reform Britain's long-hours culture. After the shameful way the government weaselled out of the EU directive imposing a 48-hour maximum week, here is a chance to turn Labour's \"family-friendly\" talk into action. </p> <p>But it may not happen. The CBI yesterday expressed shock at finding the right to part-time working proposed at all. \"It would be most damaging. It is a sticking point for us,\" they said, indignant that for once they were not forewarned. They will fight it all the way, demanding \"reasoned encouragement\" to employers instead of a legal obligation. </p> <p>However DTI research found flexible hours was what parents wanted most. This could start a revolution. If campaigners push to see that paid parental leave is reinstated too, with a right to spread it out across one day a week, suddenly the four-day week looks possible - and eventually universal. Why not? With 30% more wealth in the next decade why not work less? </p> <p>Will Byers stand firm? He has also proposed a loophole that would effectively nullify the right to flexible work. Small businesses may be exempt. That means exempting a third of the workforce, including those who most need the right: many bigger employers already offer flexibility. Labour has gone to extraordinary lengths to mollify small employers as if they were a national treasure, when the opposite is often the case. Small businesses are already exempt from many workers rights. </p> <p>When the minimum wage was first mooted, it was small employers who claimed thousands of jobs would be lost. Meanwhile large employers briefed - sotto voce - that if some small businesses went to the wall because they couldn't afford to pay a living wage, it would be no bad thing. Those running small nursing homes, or marginal catering and cleaning outfits often offer bad services, undercutting better professional companies that give employees decent conditions. </p> <p>Some economists suggest Britain's low productivity, about which Gordon Brown fulminates frequently, may be partly connected with the UK having too many small companies: a quarter of all EU firms employing under 20 people are in the UK. As larger companies point out sardonically, few small companies choose to be small. Yet there is a strange Treasury sentimentality about them, offering special tax breaks and assistance. Why should they get a dispensation to mistreat their workforce with exemptions from reasonable employment laws? (Should small chimney-sweeping companies still be allowed to send boys up chimneys?) </p> <p>Labour's manifesto could trounce the Tories by offering a revolution for young families. It would expose Tory \"family\" talk for the cant it is. One popular move would be Harman's idea of a special tax credit for under-threes, allowing mothers to stay at home or use it for childcare if they go back to work. What about a pledge for state-of-the-art nurseries in every neighbourhood for all? </p> <p>Could the Tories refuse to endorse these? Yet every time they match Labour spending, as on health and education, their tax cuts become more incredible. The Tories will mistakenly take the employer's side on these parental rights, while Labour now has the chance to write a dazzlingly popular manifesto for families. </p> <p>\u0095 Parents at Work demo, at the DTI, 1 Victoria St, SW1.

Labour's manifesto could trounce the Tories by offering a revolution for young families. It would expose Tory \"family\" talk for the cant it is. One popular move would be Harman's idea of a special tax credit for under-threes, allowing mothers to stay at home or use it for childcare if they go back to work. What about a pledge for state-of-the-art nurseries in every neighbourhood for all? Could the Tories refuse to endorse these? Yet every time they match Labour spending, as on health and education, their tax cuts become more incredible. The Tories will mistakenly take the employer's side on these parental rights, while Labour now has the chance to write a dazzlingly popular manifesto for families. \u0095 Parents at Work demo, at the DTI, 1 Victoria St, SW1. December 14, 10.30 am. Bring small children and big toys.",

      "bodyText": "Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, is to investigate how Whitehall tried to avoid a \"bad press\" by covering up an attempt to get 112,000 poor people and pensioners to pay back \u00a310.5m of benefits they had received twice by mistake. An internal Department of Social Security audit report, leaked to the magazine Computer Weekly, revealed that Alastair Darling, social security secretary, was kept in the dark by civil servants on the quickest way to get the cash back. Instead they opted for a complicated process that has still left the ministry owed \u00a33m and has cost \u00a3465,000. The money had been paid twice by the benefits agency into the bank accounts of 111,954 people, 43% of them pensioners, using new automatic bank credits - which will become the standard way of paying benefits from 2003. Civil servants were advised that the quickest ways to retrieve the extra money would be to withhold payments for one week or debit the recipients' accounts. A more complicated way involved writing to ask them to return the money, with the threat of legal action if they failed to pay it back. This was the operation carried out, and the problem was compounded by a series of mistakes. All the letters were sent on the same day, resulting in 2,000 people jamming the benefit agency's switchboard. Nearly 1,000 letters involved sums of less than the 19p stamp it cost to send the demand. Letters were also sent to dead people and to social services departments. Claimants who owed more than \u00a31,000 were sent demands omitting the first digit, and corrected demands had to be sent out. The report revealed that the ministry had to handle 20,200 telephone calls, 65,000 letters in reply and 168 bounced cheques - costing \u00a317,479. And 77 people refused to pay. It said Mr Darling chaired a \"crisis meeting\" after the double payments error was discovered. The reason he was not told about the easy way to claim back the cash was that \"this may have caused further bad press or external pressure from lobby groups\". The DSS's auditors expressed concern about the risks of duplicate payments as the government prepares to pay tens of billions of pounds in welfare benefits by automated credit transfer into recipients' bank accounts. \"As we move towards delivery in 2003 it is imperative that we limit our exposure,\" said the report.

Mr Prebble, speaking last night at the monthly Royal Television Society dinner in central London, also praised Channel 4 for launching FilmFour and E4. He added that ITV was now, \"thanks to consolidation and common cause among its shareholders, in a position to bring about a seismic shift in the landscape of pay television in the UK\", with a \"small number of strong and well-resourced ITV multi-channels\". Mr Prebble also dismissed forecasts that the growth of multi-channel TV would mean existing advertising revenue being spread ever more thinly. He reckoned online and interactive services would open up new revenue streams. \"When TV can do for advertisers lots of things for which they previously had to rely on other media, more advertising money will move into television, producing better content.\" Mr Prebble also announced that ONdigital was to sponsor the first ever RTS award for innovation in interactive TV content.

Yes, and he defined the role of the monarchy in The English Constitution as a \"dignified\" channel for popular support, behind which the \"efficient\" parliament and administration could run the country.

The Lords has been neutered as a check since 1911, though it has revived a little since the (absolutely justified) abolition of the hereditary peers.

Although it is not impossible to imagine a monarch playing such a role, just as Juan Carlos did in Spain, my feeling is that in practice, just like the old House of Lords, monarchs will always be constrained by their lack of democratic legitimacy in confronting an over-mighty but elected government.

We at the Economist agree with that, at present: other efforts to introduce checks and balances into Britain's constitution matter more, so let's get on with the second stage of reform of the Lords (including the abolition of all those ridiculous titles), with introducing a more proportionate electoral system, a proper freedom of information law, a more independent judiciary, and so on.</p> <p>But that does not alter the principle of the matter.

The inquiry has heard that they both claim the IRA opened fire before paratroopers did in Londonderry on January 30 1972 in an operation that left 13 unarmed civil rights marchers dead.</p> <p>The informer known as Infliction is also alleged to have claimed that Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness fired the first shot and had the Bloody Sunday episode \"on his conscience\".</p> <p>Selected parts of MI5 and army documents have been aired at the inquiry's public hearings. However, large sections have been deleted and a tape of Infliction's debriefing has not been disclosed.</p> <p>Infliction is understood to have made the allegation about Mr McGuinness in 1984, more than 12 years after the event.</p> <p>The public interest immunity certificates are being challenged by lawyers acting for the relatives of those killed as well as those acting for the paratroopers.</p> <p>The families say they should be able to scrutinise the documents to challenge their content; the soldiers to support claims they opened fire only after coming under attack.</p> <p>In another twist, both the relatives of the victims and the two government departments concerned are citing article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to life - to back their case.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence and Home Office allege lives would be put at risk of IRA reprisals if the material is disclosed. The families maintain article 2 requires an \"effective official investigation into deaths at the hands of state agents\".</p> <p>Mr Clarke said yesterday: \"The only way in which the matter could be resolved, other than by production of the documents, would be if parliament were to determine that the inquiry should cease.\"</p> <p>He told the inquiry: \"Information that is not revealed might be something that you would, were it not secret, want to raise with one or more of the witnesses in order to resolve important issues in the case. If you cannot do so, the issue may simply be unresolvable.\"</p> <p>The three-man tribunal - Lord Saville, John Toohey and William Hoyt - will study the documents over the weekend before reaching a decision on disclosure. If they decide they should be disclosed, the Home Office and the MoD are likely to appeal.</p> <p>The inquiry was set up in 1998 and has cost an estimated \u00a330m. Public hearings opened in Londonderry's Guildhall in March. So far, only four days have been devoted to hearing live evidence from witnesses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Bloody Sunday inquiry could collapse due to a refusal by ministers to disclose documents relating to MI5 informers and to the army, the counsel to the tribunal, Christopher Clarke QC, warned yesterday. The inquiry was abruptly adjourned to allow Lord Saville, the tribunal's chairman, to inspect documents covered by public interest immunity certificates blocking disclosure, signed by Jack Straw, and the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon. The Home Office documents refer to claims made by serving and former MI5 officers, and to two informers known as Infliction and Observer B. The inquiry has heard that they both claim the IRA opened fire before paratroopers did in Londonderry on January 30 1972 in an operation that left 13 unarmed civil rights marchers dead. The informer known as Infliction is also alleged to have claimed that Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness fired the first shot and had the Bloody Sunday episode \"on his conscience\". Selected parts of MI5 and army documents have been aired at the inquiry's public hearings. However, large sections have been deleted and a tape of Infliction's debriefing has not been disclosed. Infliction is understood to have made the allegation about Mr McGuinness in 1984, more than 12 years after the event. The public interest immunity certificates are being challenged by lawyers acting for the relatives of those killed as well as those acting for the paratroopers. The families say they should be able to scrutinise the documents to challenge their content; the soldiers to support claims they opened fire only after coming under attack. In another twist, both the relatives of the victims and the two government departments concerned are citing article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to life - to back their case. The Ministry of Defence and Home Office allege lives would be put at risk of IRA reprisals if the material is disclosed. The families maintain article 2 requires an \"effective official investigation into deaths at the hands of state agents\". Mr Clarke said yesterday: \"The only way in which the matter could be resolved, other than by production of the documents, would be if parliament were to determine that the inquiry should cease.\" He told the inquiry: \"Information that is not revealed might be something that you would, were it not secret, want to raise with one or more of the witnesses in order to resolve important issues in the case. If you cannot do so, the issue may simply be unresolvable.\" The three-man tribunal - Lord Saville, John Toohey and William Hoyt - will study the documents over the weekend before reaching a decision on disclosure. If they decide they should be disclosed, the Home Office and the MoD are likely to appeal. The inquiry was set up in 1998 and has cost an estimated \u00a330m. Public hearings opened in Londonderry's Guildhall in March. So far, only four days have been devoted to hearing live evidence from witnesses.",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for General Augusto Pinochet were trying to persuade appeal judges yesterday to overturn a lower court order for the former Chilean dictator's house arrest, arguing that it was based on procedural irregularities and threatened Chile's stability. Armed forces chiefs were preparing to meet President Ricardo Lagos in the growing constitutional confrontation. The appeal court case is the latest stage in the prolonged legal battle to force the general to be judged for crimes allegedly committed when he ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990. The detention order was suspended on Tuesday pending the appeal. Gen Pinochet's lawyers said yesterday that the order had been made before the general had been questioned and before tests of his psychological state. Human rights lawyers said that Judge Juan Guzman, who ordered the arrest, had acted correctly. \"We have all confidence that, given the judge ordering the arrest followed the rule of law all along, there can be no doubt that the appeal will be thrown out,\" Juan Bustos said. Judge Guzman is investigating more than 180 cases against the retired general and has repeatedly said that he has strictly adhered to the law. The arrest order relates to Gen Pinochet's alleged involvement in more than 70 abductions and murders carried out in 1973 by a military squad known as the \"Caravan of Death\". Both sides say they will appeal to the supreme court if the verdict goes against them, so the final decision may not be known until late next week. President Lagos said that after he had met the the four commanders-in-chief to discuss the arrest order he would call a meeting of the National Security Council - which only meets to discuss events provoking institutional crises- once the courts had ruled on the appeal. Mr Lagos maintains that Gen Pinochet's fate is a matter for the courts and says he will await their ruling to avoid giving the impression that any pressure is being put on the judicial system. Gen Pinochet, 85, who recently recovered from pneumonia and is resting at his retreat in Bucalemu, 80 miles south-west of the capital Santiago, had been regarded as untouchable in Chile. The detention order caused concern among rightwingers and the armed forces, which still wield enormous power. More than 3,000 people died or disappeared, presumed dead, under Gen Pinochet's authoritarian rule from 1973 to 1989 while tens of thousands of Chileans fled the country. Gen Pinochet returned from Britain in March after spending 503 days under house arrest near London. He was held in Britain in October 1998 after a Spanish judge sought his extradition to face trial for the torture of Spanish citizens in Chile. But the House of Lords ruled that he was too old and sick to be tried. Doctors said he suffered two strokes while in Britain.",

The result is that a pass-the-parcel approach to asylum seekers continues to apply in Europe. The countries under most pressure are those guarding the gates in the east (Germany and Austria) and south (Italy, Spain, Portugal) from the large number of asylum seekers from eastern states and north Africa. But last year's figures show that after Germany, the UK received the largest number of appli cants in Europe. If the UK dropped its veto - as it will be asked to do in Nice - and joined in the common approach, other European states would have to pay more attention to suspicious lorries heading towards UK - and the UK would have access to the Shengen data-base, the largest in Europe, on who has been refused entry by other states.</p> <p>There are reasons why more liberal organs than the Sun, might also agree to a common approach too. Currently, the UK cherrypicks the EU immigration directives it is ready to back. In Nice, it is supporting two directives tightening regulations (one against traffickers in illegal immigrants and another creating a common expulsion and deportation procedure) but opposing a more liberal move to allow citizens to bring in foreign spouses and relatives. Although all European states vigilantly guard their borders, German and French ministers have joined the British in acknowledging Europe's need to import more skilled workers to fill its labour gaps. This is a new shift. Unlike the US and Australia, immigration has always had a negative connotation in the UK. This new positive approach, is another reason why it would make sense for the UK to drop its veto.</p>",

If the UK dropped its veto - as it will be asked to do in Nice - and joined in the common approach, other European states would have to pay more attention to suspicious lorries heading towards UK - and the UK would have access to the Shengen data-base, the largest in Europe, on who has been refused entry by other states. There are reasons why more liberal organs than the Sun, might also agree to a common approach too. Currently, the UK cherrypicks the EU immigration directives it is ready to back. In Nice, it is supporting two directives tightening regulations (one against traffickers in illegal immigrants and another creating a common expulsion and deportation procedure) but opposing a more liberal move to allow citizens to bring in foreign spouses and relatives. Although all European states vigilantly guard their borders, German and French ministers have joined the British in acknowledging Europe's need to import more skilled workers to fill its labour gaps. This is a new shift. Unlike the US and Australia, immigration has always had a negative connotation in the UK. This new positive approach, is another reason why it would make sense for the UK to drop its veto.",

      "body": "<p>Jacques Chirac, the French host of the crucial EU summit in Nice which opened yesterday, was last night accused of playing domestic politics with European defence policy after insisting that Nato must be kept at arm's length on key military issues.</p> <p>In remarks that irritated Tony Blair, President Chirac used his first summit appearance to underline his long-standing wish to minimise the alliance's role in the new rapid reaction force.</p> <p>The French president, whose police had earlier been forced to dispel anti-summit protesters with teargas, insisted that he had no intention of seeking to weaken Nato. But he insisted that although the 60,000-strong force would co-ordinate with Nato command, it had to be \"independent\" from its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.</p> <p>Given the historic French hostility to the US domination of Nato, President Chirac's comments set alarm bells ringing as EU leaders gathered for a summit designed to smooth the entry of former Soviet bloc states, some of which are already Nato members.</p> <p>Spokesmen for Mr Blair, already under fire from Eurosceptics at home over the alleged threat to Nato, told reporters that the French leader was fully committed to the project. It is designed to let European peacekeepers act in the EU's own backyard in future crises similar to the Kosovo drama which exposed the EU's military impotence.</p> <p>\"The important thing is that the military planning capability rests with Nato,\" the prime minister said.</p> <p>Detailed documents to be approved by all 15 leaders today formally declare the EU's support for the 50-year-old Nato alliance. They state explicitly that the rapid reaction force \"does not involve the establishment of a European army\" - the emotive phrase whose use by Tory tabloids has enraged Downing St.</p> <p>But the timing of the incident is unfortunate for Mr Blair at the start of what promises to be a bruising summit where vital institutional reforms have to be agreed to facilitate decision-making after the EU moves to 15 to an eventual 27 members.</p> <p>Iain Duncan-Smith, shadow defence secretary, jumped into the row in London. \"Tony Blair's cynical attempt to cosy up to the French by betraying Nato is in ruins,\" he said last night. \"The French president has now made clear that the price of the Euro army is the exclusion of the Americans from an alliance which has kept the peace in western Europe for more than 50 years.\"</p> <p>With a UK election expected next spring, Mr Blair knows he must defend Britain's red lines -vetoes on tax and social security. Yesterday his Tory predecessor, John Ma jor, warned him to leave \"plenty of fat\" around his negotiating position to protect those core issues from too much pressure between now and what may prove a deadlocked summit that staggers into Sunday.</p> <p>The Nato spat comes days after a warning from the outgoing US defence secretary, William Cohen, that the alliance could become a \"relic of history\" if the EU does not do more to share its burdens - as Mr Blair wishes - and protect the cohesion of Nato's command structure.</p> <p>In Brussels, Nato officials are expressing concern about France's refusal to commit itself to close cooperation between Nato and the EU on military planning.</p> <p>\"They are refusing to be tied down to an EU-Nato agreement,\" one official said.</p> <p>Britain insists that the main role of the EU's proposed military staff, of some 100 personnel, must be to liaise with Nato.

      "bodyText": "Jacques Chirac, the French host of the crucial EU summit in Nice which opened yesterday, was last night accused of playing domestic politics with European defence policy after insisting that Nato must be kept at arm's length on key military issues. In remarks that irritated Tony Blair, President Chirac used his first summit appearance to underline his long-standing wish to minimise the alliance's role in the new rapid reaction force. The French president, whose police had earlier been forced to dispel anti-summit protesters with teargas, insisted that he had no intention of seeking to weaken Nato. But he insisted that although the 60,000-strong force would co-ordinate with Nato command, it had to be \"independent\" from its Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. Given the historic French hostility to the US domination of Nato, President Chirac's comments set alarm bells ringing as EU leaders gathered for a summit designed to smooth the entry of former Soviet bloc states, some of which are already Nato members. Spokesmen for Mr Blair, already under fire from Eurosceptics at home over the alleged threat to Nato, told reporters that the French leader was fully committed to the project. It is designed to let European peacekeepers act in the EU's own backyard in future crises similar to the Kosovo drama which exposed the EU's military impotence. \"The important thing is that the military planning capability rests with Nato,\" the prime minister said. Detailed documents to be approved by all 15 leaders today formally declare the EU's support for the 50-year-old Nato alliance. They state explicitly that the rapid reaction force \"does not involve the establishment of a European army\" - the emotive phrase whose use by Tory tabloids has enraged Downing St. But the timing of the incident is unfortunate for Mr Blair at the start of what promises to be a bruising summit where vital institutional reforms have to be agreed to facilitate decision-making after the EU moves to 15 to an eventual 27 members. Iain Duncan-Smith, shadow defence secretary, jumped into the row in London. \"Tony Blair's cynical attempt to cosy up to the French by betraying Nato is in ruins,\" he said last night. \"The French president has now made clear that the price of the Euro army is the exclusion of the Americans from an alliance which has kept the peace in western Europe for more than 50 years.\" With a UK election expected next spring, Mr Blair knows he must defend Britain's red lines -vetoes on tax and social security. Yesterday his Tory predecessor, John Ma jor, warned him to leave \"plenty of fat\" around his negotiating position to protect those core issues from too much pressure between now and what may prove a deadlocked summit that staggers into Sunday. The Nato spat comes days after a warning from the outgoing US defence secretary, William Cohen, that the alliance could become a \"relic of history\" if the EU does not do more to share its burdens - as Mr Blair wishes - and protect the cohesion of Nato's command structure. In Brussels, Nato officials are expressing concern about France's refusal to commit itself to close cooperation between Nato and the EU on military planning. \"They are refusing to be tied down to an EU-Nato agreement,\" one official said. Britain insists that the main role of the EU's proposed military staff, of some 100 personnel, must be to liaise with Nato. Though it could have an advisory role, it must not lead to a separate EU command and control structure, says Britain. This is also the position of the US. France is continuing to block arrangements that would automatically and permanently \"lock in\" the EU with Nato, say Nato officials. But diplomats said the French statement was intended largely for domestic political purposes after similar remarks by the French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, Mr Chirac's likely rival for the presidency in 2002. Both put on a united front last night. Mr Blair flew to the summit declaring he would defy fellow leaders who want him to surrender Britain's veto in crucial areas as part of the reform of EU decision-making. \"The British position on tax is quite clear,\" he said. \"Every country has got its clear no-go areas and on the issue of tax there is no way we are going to yield up the veto.\" Hot agenda items at the summit are how to reduce the size of the 20-strong European Commission, to extend qualified majority voting into new areas and to re-weight votes in the European Council to give big countries, including Britain, a bigger voice. At the start of the summit, French riot police fought pitched battles with protesters a few hundred yards from the main venue, firing volleys of teargas as fireworks and furniture were hurled towards them. A group of several hundred Spanish anarchists, radical trade unionists and Basque and Corsican separatists were thought to be orchestrating the protests.

Spielmann's foundation, which raised \u00a3200,000 to launch it, had a dual purpose: to provide work for blind people, and to give those who can see an insight into their world. \"We hope to make people more sensitive to the problems of the blind,\" says Schaffner. \"It's a new experience for diners: you take one sense away, so you have to use all the others much more.\" </p> <p>When you arrive, your bag and coat are put into a locker - it would be hazardous to leave anything on the floor of the dining room - and you step into a dimly lit ante-room which is supposed to acclimatise you to darkness (occasionally, guests find the blackness of the dining room too claustrophobic and have to leave). When your waiter arrives to greet you, you place your hands on her shoulders and are taken through the blackout curtain and into the dining room. The blind leading the blind. </p> <p>The room is not merely dark; it is entirely devoid of light. The distinction is important: usually in darkness you can make out shadowy shapes; here you can see nothing. Your eyes work furiously to attempt to see something, but in vain, and the effort is so tiring that you have to close them. In dim light, they would be straining even harder. </p> <p>The great challenge in eating blind is conversation. A conversation between sighted people relies on body language, facial expressions, eye contact: the words are just part of the interaction. Blind people depend to a much greater extent on their voice. \"Usually, in a restaurant, everything is done with your eyes,\" says Schaffner, \"but here you put that away and suddenly everybody is the same. The quality of what you say counts: not your designer tie, not your shoes, not your fashion haircut, not whether you are beautiful or ugly, just your voice. If you don't talk, you don't exist.\" </p> <p>The restaurant has become a popular venue for blind dates: couples can meet and see how they get along without the distractions of what they look like and how they eat. In the restaurant, couples can stick to essentials; afterwards, in the lobby, they can check out the aesthetics. </p> <p>The menu is small: three starters, a meat dish, a fish dish, a vegetarian option, a couple of desserts. The waiters either memorise what has been ordered or, for large parties, use a dictaphone. Eating and drinking is a challenge. Elizabeth encourages me to pour my own beer, which has to be done carefully, using the index finger of the left hand to check how full the glass is. You quickly realise that you have to keep your elbows off the table, a perception underlined by the sound of a bottle falling to the floor elsewhere in the restaurant. </p> <p>I have no idea how large the room is, or how close the tables are together. It can seat no more than 60, and I was at a table for six, so there are perhaps a dozen tables. Noise levels are normal (ignore those who suggest that darkness makes people talk more loudly), and there is an awkward moment of silence when one of the revellers on my table makes a lewd remark (perhaps in the dark everyone is listening more intently). </p> <p>Many large groups come to Blindekuh: families, office parties, but so far no wedding receptions (Schaffner thinks the bride would take offence). Clearly, part of the appeal is bonding: a strange, shared experience. It is arguable whether this brief, immobile immersion in darkness gives any real insight into blindness, but clearly it will make you look (or not look) at your friends, family, fellow diners in a different way. </p> <p>Eating is messy. I courageously had borscht to start, which was surprisingly straightforward once I had located the spoon. But the beef, dumplings and assorted vegetables were trickier. Most of the dumplings went on the table, some of the vegetables ended up on the floor, and cutting meat is almost impossible. The solution is to abandon social niceties (irrelevant in the dark) and eat with your hands. </p> <p>There may be something mildly transgressive in this whole enterprise. In Vladimir Nabokov's Laughter in the Dark, an unfaithful, gold-digging wife exploits her wealthy husband's blindness by secretly installing her lover in their home. The husband's presence heightens the illicit lovers' passion. Who knows, perhaps my fellow diners were naked; perhaps Elizabeth was naked; perhaps Santa, behind that flowing white (I am making assumptions here) beard was naked. In the kingdom of the blind, the cock-eyed imagination is king. I curb my wilder fantasies. My sole transgression is to lick the dish after I've eaten my ice-cream. </p> <p>Does the idea work? I would be intrigued to go with someone I knew, to see how the dynamic changed once we were deprived of all the usual props to conversation. It was difficult to gauge talking to four total strangers. The restaurant claims that eating blind makes you think about the food more: you eat more slowly, sniff the food, touch it, savour it. But that is questionable: I wasn't aware of the meal being slower, just messier. You do lose track of time, though: luminous watches have to be removed, mobile phones are not permitted, welcome to the void. </p> <p>The challenge will be to retain the purity of the idea, especially if Blind Cows spring up elsewhere. The Zurich restaurant works because of the idealism of the founders (tempered by the management nous of Schaffner, who used to work for the Best Western hotel chain), the combination of eating and education (the restaurant also runs intensive afternoon sessions demonstrating what it is like to be blind), and the enthusiasm of the staff, especially the blind waiters who recognise that they have been given a unique opportunity (imagine, in any other context, the employment potential of a blind waiter).

      "body": "<p> The important issue is whether there should be legislation that blatantly discriminates against a Christian religion. The subject is particularly relevant as we live in a multifaith community. The heir to the throne can accede if he marries a Muslim, a Buddhist, a scientologist, a Moonie, an atheist or a sun-worshipper, but not if he marries a Roman Catholic. Leaving such a stigma in place when no other religion or faith is singled out is grossly unfair. </p> <p>I wrote to the prime minister, whose response offered no defence or justification for the present legislation. He had \"no plans\" to do anything about the situation and said that reforming the law would be complex. That is absolutely right. Similarly, it was complex to reform the House of Lords, but that did not prove an insurmountable problem. The complexity can be exaggerated. </p> <p>It occurred to me that it would be helpful to have a consultation exercise that involved all the faiths and churches in Scotland. The responses indicate widespread consensus against this kind of religious discrimination. Out of nine responses, eight were clearly opposed to discrimination and the ninth was conscious of the complexity of the matter. Cardinal Winning made the valid point that \"royal commissions are normally established to tackle some thorny issue on which there is no wide consensus. The campaign to end the Act of Settlement commands broad public and political support. Indeed, I can think of no major public figure prepared to defend the language of intolerance contained in the offensive clauses. What is now needed is a clear signal that this issue will be tackled, and tackled soon.\" </p> <p>I cannot but feel the force of that argument.

The prime minister immediately challenged Winchilsea to a duel - the only time, as far as I can recall, that a prime minister has had to defend his honour in that way. On March 21 1829, not long after first light, the prime minister and Winchilsea met on Battersea fields. When the moment to shoot arrived, the prime minister took careful aim and fired wide.

If the Duke of Wellington - who was, if I may say, even more rightwing than Mr Tony Blair, which is saying quite a lot - was prepared to take a stand on principle and bring in progressive reform, surely it is not too much to hope that our prime minister can show the same kind of moral courage. </p> <p>The basic truth that was applicable in 1829 and remains so today is that a substantial proportion of our countrymen and countrywomen are of Roman Catholic origin. There are some 800,000 Scots of Roman Catholic origin, and they deserve better than to have outdated legislation, some 300 years old, in force discriminating against them.

      "bodyText": "The important issue is whether there should be legislation that blatantly discriminates against a Christian religion. The subject is particularly relevant as we live in a multifaith community. The heir to the throne can accede if he marries a Muslim, a Buddhist, a scientologist, a Moonie, an atheist or a sun-worshipper, but not if he marries a Roman Catholic. Leaving such a stigma in place when no other religion or faith is singled out is grossly unfair. I wrote to the prime minister, whose response offered no defence or justification for the present legislation. He had \"no plans\" to do anything about the situation and said that reforming the law would be complex. That is absolutely right. Similarly, it was complex to reform the House of Lords, but that did not prove an insurmountable problem. The complexity can be exaggerated. It occurred to me that it would be helpful to have a consultation exercise that involved all the faiths and churches in Scotland. The responses indicate widespread consensus against this kind of religious discrimination. Out of nine responses, eight were clearly opposed to discrimination and the ninth was conscious of the complexity of the matter. Cardinal Winning made the valid point that \"royal commissions are normally established to tackle some thorny issue on which there is no wide consensus. The campaign to end the Act of Settlement commands broad public and political support. Indeed, I can think of no major public figure prepared to defend the language of intolerance contained in the offensive clauses. What is now needed is a clear signal that this issue will be tackled, and tackled soon.\" I cannot but feel the force of that argument. My own church, the Church of Scotland, stated in a letter: \"It is the view of the legal questions committee that the discriminatory provisions of the Act of Settlement have no place in our contemporary society. The act was a product of its times and those times are not our times.

Within weeks of taking up his cabinet post, Mr Byers issued the provocative declaration that wealth creation was more important than wealth redistribution - hardly the sentiments of a reformer. However, his green paper on parental rights, published yesterday, does have a radical edge which would usher in the most significant changes since the second world war in this contentious area. The prospect of a near doubling in statutory maternity pay and an extension of unpaid maternity leave to allow a woman to stay at home for a year would go a long way towards taking Britain closer to more generous arrangements in Europe. At the launch of his green paper yesterday Mr Byers demonstrated his new found credentials as a radical when he declared that Britain was \"way off pace\" on parental rights. \"The status quo is not an option,\" he said. Mr Byers is not, however, about to abandon his role as a modernising Blairite.

Despite the best efforts of my colleagues to get me worked into a fever over the act's denial of my human rights, I am unconcerned that it denies Catholics the right to wear the crown, or marry those who hold it. Rather, it is their troublemaking that makes me boil.</p> <p>The Guardian has not, thus far, been known as a friend to Catholics. Within these pages, the sins of individuals are visited on the church to a degree that even Islam has avoided. Now it makes a grand stand on our behalf? I don't think so. Its objective is not to see a Catholic on the throne, but to have no throne at all. That is not likely to find great support among as conservative a minority as Catholics - and certainly not from those of us of recusant descent, whose families invariably fought for Charles I, seeing in him some protection from the anti-Catholic excesses of the republicans.</p> <p>Really, there is some irony in Cromwell's heirs using the human rights of Catholics to justify their cause. There is irony too in them holding up the Act of Settlement as representing all that is rotten in our democracy. The act did not simply establish the current royal dynasty and a Protestant succession. It established the rule of law.</p> <p>For the first time, it was laid down that the monarch might not dismiss judges at will. Other limitations were imposed on the royal prerogative. The monarch could not leave England or make war without the consent of parliament.</p> <p>Now the monarch was established for the benefit of the people and not the other way round. The last section of the act is very moving: \"And whereas the laws of England are the birthright of the people thereof, and all the Kings and Queens, who shall ascend the throne of this Realm, ought to administer the government of the same according to the said laws, and all their officers and ministers ought to serve them respectively according to the same: the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do therefore humbly pray, That all the laws and statues of this realm for securing the established religion, and the rights and liberties of the people thereof, and all other laws and statues of the same now in force, may be ratified and confirmed.\" What, I wonder, would the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland write its place?</p> <p>Although it might not be strictly necessary to disestablish the Church of England, the opportunity to do so would be taken. Would this benefit Catholics - or Jews, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists?</p> <p>A letter quoted in the Runnymede Trust's controversial report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain notes how secular society tends to push religion to the margins of public space. Islamaphobia and anti-Semitism merge with a more widespread rejection of religion running through a significant part of the \"tolerant\", educated middle classes and the progressive media. Disestablishment would serve only to make all religions equally insignificant. Meanwhile the beliefs of the \"educated middle classes\" would run, untrammelled, through parliament, the media, cultural life and school lessons.</p> <p>The monarch would be replaced by somebody akin to the gargoyles now sitting in our House of the Bourgeois Lords. \"I never tried to defend the Lords in the old days,\" Jeremy Paxman wrote in the Spectator last week, \"but I simply cannot see how the new place is any more legitimate: at least there used to be the possibility of unpredictability by accident of birth.\" Now he sees Tony's cronies, a few extinct political volcanoes and, with the coming people's peers, \"a selection of busybodies who want a role in governing us without the inconvenience of getting elected\". The Guardian's republic will be a dictatorship of the proletariat by school swots who dress in expensive casual wear and enjoy a little traditional toff bashing.</p> <p>It has been said that the Act of Settlement cannot be repealed without amending or repealing at least eight other pieces of legislations. In fact, as Lord Douglas-Hamilton told the Scottish parliament, its non-religious provisions have been amended six times already. We could change them without unravelling the entire constitution.

      "bodyText": "The blood of Catholic martyrs flows in my veins. But, as I read the 1701 Act of Settlement on the Guardian's website yesterday, my face did not flush nor my veins throb. Despite the best efforts of my colleagues to get me worked into a fever over the act's denial of my human rights, I am unconcerned that it denies Catholics the right to wear the crown, or marry those who hold it. Rather, it is their troublemaking that makes me boil. The Guardian has not, thus far, been known as a friend to Catholics. Within these pages, the sins of individuals are visited on the church to a degree that even Islam has avoided. Now it makes a grand stand on our behalf? I don't think so. Its objective is not to see a Catholic on the throne, but to have no throne at all. That is not likely to find great support among as conservative a minority as Catholics - and certainly not from those of us of recusant descent, whose families invariably fought for Charles I, seeing in him some protection from the anti-Catholic excesses of the republicans. Really, there is some irony in Cromwell's heirs using the human rights of Catholics to justify their cause. There is irony too in them holding up the Act of Settlement as representing all that is rotten in our democracy. The act did not simply establish the current royal dynasty and a Protestant succession. It established the rule of law. For the first time, it was laid down that the monarch might not dismiss judges at will. Other limitations were imposed on the royal prerogative. The monarch could not leave England or make war without the consent of parliament. Now the monarch was established for the benefit of the people and not the other way round. The last section of the act is very moving: \"And whereas the laws of England are the birthright of the people thereof, and all the Kings and Queens, who shall ascend the throne of this Realm, ought to administer the government of the same according to the said laws, and all their officers and ministers ought to serve them respectively according to the same: the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do therefore humbly pray, That all the laws and statues of this realm for securing the established religion, and the rights and liberties of the people thereof, and all other laws and statues of the same now in force, may be ratified and confirmed.\" What, I wonder, would the Guardian's Jonathan Freedland write its place? Although it might not be strictly necessary to disestablish the Church of England, the opportunity to do so would be taken. Would this benefit Catholics - or Jews, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists? A letter quoted in the Runnymede Trust's controversial report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain notes how secular society tends to push religion to the margins of public space. Islamaphobia and anti-Semitism merge with a more widespread rejection of religion running through a significant part of the \"tolerant\", educated middle classes and the progressive media. Disestablishment would serve only to make all religions equally insignificant. Meanwhile the beliefs of the \"educated middle classes\" would run, untrammelled, through parliament, the media, cultural life and school lessons. The monarch would be replaced by somebody akin to the gargoyles now sitting in our House of the Bourgeois Lords. \"I never tried to defend the Lords in the old days,\" Jeremy Paxman wrote in the Spectator last week, \"but I simply cannot see how the new place is any more legitimate: at least there used to be the possibility of unpredictability by accident of birth.\" Now he sees Tony's cronies, a few extinct political volcanoes and, with the coming people's peers, \"a selection of busybodies who want a role in governing us without the inconvenience of getting elected\". The Guardian's republic will be a dictatorship of the proletariat by school swots who dress in expensive casual wear and enjoy a little traditional toff bashing. It has been said that the Act of Settlement cannot be repealed without amending or repealing at least eight other pieces of legislations. In fact, as Lord Douglas-Hamilton told the Scottish parliament, its non-religious provisions have been amended six times already. We could change them without unravelling the entire constitution. But that is not what the republican advocates of repeal want. As a Catholic I would like to see a Catholic monarch (who would improve on the horrors we produced in the 16th and 17th centuries). As a woman I have little affection for male primogeniture. But if this paper is for repealing the Act of Settlement, I am against it. comment@theguardian.com Useful links Latest ICM polls Official British monarchy website Movement Against the Monarchy Full text of the Act of Settlement (from American parliament campaign)",

Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, said it was no longer accurate to talk about a winter crisis in the health service, because problems of under-capacity and overwork continued all year round. Reporting on the association's council meeting on Wednesday, he said: \"The mood was one of despair and powerlessness to influence what is going on, because of not having the workforce or capacity.\" The condition of GP representatives could best be described as \"clinically depressed\".

But his members have become increasingly disillusioned by the speed at which extra resources earmarked for the NHS can be translated into a better service for patients. The BMA published results of a Mori opinion poll showing the proportion of the general public satisfied with the NHS fell from 72% in January 1998 to 58% last month. When asked who or what was most responsible for the current state of affairs, 44% of the unprompted replies referred unspecifically to \"the government\", 20% to \"the Conservative government\", 11% to \"the Labour government\", 16% to NHS managers, and 2% to doctors.

The haste suggests some ministers think there is a serious chance of forcing the bill on to the statute book before a May general election. Alternatively, the government has calculated it is not averse to a fight with the Conservative rural lobby in the run-up to the election. MPs will be given a free vote on three options. The key vote will be in a separate debate in the new year when MPs will take the bill as a committee of the whole house. Once one of the options has been chosen the bill will be debated in detail by a smaller group of MPs in committee. The procedure is the same as that used by the government to pilot deregulation of Sunday trading in the Shops Act. The three options, to be revealed in detail today when the bill is published, will be voluntary regulation, an outright ban, and licencing under a form of statutory regulation. Downing Street indicated that the prime minister will vote for an outright ban. Ms Beckett denied the decision to place the hunting bill so early in the timetable threatened to clog up the rest of its legislative programme, including its anti-crime measures.

With the controversial punchcard ballots under guard in a nearby room, and with Al Gore and George W Bush watching on television from Washington and Texas respectively, the judges wondered aloud whether they had any right to intervene in the most hotly disputed US election of the century. The court adjourned last night to consider their ruling, which could come at any time today. A victory for the vice-president, paving the way for a recount of up to 14,700 contested votes, would throw the US political scene into turmoil and take the constitution into uncharted waters. It could lead to the overturning of Mr Bush's 537-vote victory margin in Florida, and would almost certainly be challenged by Republican legislators in Florida and the US Congress. A decision in favour of Mr Bush, ruling out a recount, would be a crippling blow to Mr Gore's hopes of winning the presidency. His only chance of fighting on would be two separate private cases under way yesterday in the Tallahassee courts, where Democrats are calling for up to 25,000 votes to be invalidated because Republican party workers were allowed to fill in missing information on absentee ballot application forms before the election. Rulings in both those lawsuits are also expected today. However, if the judge in either case makes the unexpected decision to disenfranchise thousands of voters because of what the Republicans portrayed as a \"hyper-technicality\", it would be immediately appealed to the Florida supreme court. The judge in one of the cases, Nikki Clark, made plain her reluctance to follow that route yesterday, asking Democratic lawyers: \"Why should I not find there was substantial compliance by the voters and accept their vote?\" If the Florida supreme court rules against Mr Gore on his call for a recount, however, many Democrats are likely to call for him not to pursue the absentee ballots cases. \"This is coming to an end,\" said Democratic senator Dick Durbin. He said a Bush presidency \"looks more and more\" likely. The judges at the state's highest court yesterday closely questioned both sides over the constitutionality and legality of a recount. The Florida bench is made up of six Democrats and one independent. But, worryingly for Mr Gore, they showed they were keenly aware of the scrutiny of the US supreme court, which on Monday asked them to justify their intervention in the election, a tacit warning for the Florida court not to overreach its powers. In a significant exchange, the Florida chief justice Charles Wells suggested to Mr Gore's lawyer, David Boies, that the state legislature had \"plenary power\" over the conduct of elections, \"and that power cannot be eroded even by the state constitution\". However, another judge, Barbara Pariente, argued that a lower Florida court may have misinterpreted the law when it dismissed Mr Gore's challenge to the election result. Sanders Sauls had ruled that the vice-president had failed to prove there was a \"reasonable probability\" that the election result would be changed if the disputed ballots were counted. Justice Pariente pointed out that the relevant statute only required that the ballots \"cast doubt\" on the outcome. After yesterday's hearings, Mr Boies said that the Gore camp would accept the ruling of the court as the \"final arbiter\". He added that if it ruled in Mr Gore's favour, the disputed ballots could be counted by Tuesday, the legal deadline for Florida to decide which way it will vote in the electoral college that will formally elect the president six days later.",

Although they originally opposed the operation, they are reconciled to their situation and are delighted at Jodie' progress. But they attacked one of the appeal judges who heard arguments earlier this year over whether the operation should take place. </p> <p>Despite their differing opinions, it was clear from last night's programme that there is mutual respect between doctors and parents.

      "bodyText": "The surgeons who separated the conjoined twins Jodie and Mary spoke publicly for the first time last night about the dilemma of conducting an operation that would end in the weaker child's death. Alan Dickson and Adrian Bianchi gave a detailed account of the delicate and rarely performed operation that saved Jodie, and spoke of their feelings about the inevitable death of Mary. The twins' parents, Michaelangelo and Rina Attard, who can be identified after they asked for a privacy ruling to be lifted, told ITV's Tonight with Trevor McDonald that Jodie was recovering well. Although they originally opposed the operation, they are reconciled to their situation and are delighted at Jodie' progress. But they attacked one of the appeal judges who heard arguments earlier this year over whether the operation should take place. Despite their differing opinions, it was clear from last night's programme that there is mutual respect between doctors and parents. All are committed Christians and Mr Bianchi shares the parents' Maltese heritage. Mr and Mrs Attard are from the Mediterranean island of Gozo. The surgeons were conscious that their actions would result in one child's death: the twins were joined at the pelvis, and Mary's life was maintained by her sister's heart and lungs.

Repeatedly accusing the president of authoritarian tendencies, he has sought to depict himself as a protector of democracy. Last week he made a very public \u00a32m donation to save the Andrei Sakharov human rights centre in Moscow. Mr Glushkov's lawyer said the charges were unfounded his client was seriously ill.",

      "body": "<p>Campaigners for working parents are celebrating. Finally, after more than two decades, they have a green paper which honestly and sensibly confronts a debate about maternity and paternity leave. Britain has been left behind in Europe; many countries have long since outstripped us in the provisions made for new parents to care for their children. This is despite Britain having some of the highest rates of female participation in the labour market. The cost to the quality of family life and the well-being of babies is self-evident. All of this is generously acknowledged and backed up with detailed research in the Work and Parents green paper. The message, delivered by Stephen Byers yesterday, is clear: no change is not an option. That will help focus the minds of those businesses that persist in opposing any improvement.</p> <p>There are plenty of other goodies in this Christmas stocking - indeed something for everyone as is the wont of New Labour. They include the outlines of a package carefully designed to keep everyone sweet. It runs along the lines of: an increase in statutory maternity pay (SMP) from \u00a360.20 to around \u00a3100 a week, or an extension of maternity leave up to a year; men get two weeks paid paternity leave; business gets a generous exemption scheme on flexible working rights, plus plenty of help on administration costs and recruiting replacements to cover for maternity leave. They even recommend tackling anomalies such as adoptive parents not being entitled to leave and those women not eligible for maternity pay - such as student nurses. There are other interesting suggestions, including switching unpaid maternity leave between parents.</p> <p>This is all a huge step change in government thinking - remember only a few years ago, government laughed the idea of paid paternity leave out of court. But having paid credit where it is due, it is not churlish to point out some disturbing weaknesses. The most depressing is that it presents increasing SMP and lengthening leave as either/or alternatives. But one without the other is useless; women need longer leave, yet they will not take it unless they can afford it. Hopefully, this is just a slip of wording. The paper took a very dim view of extending earnings related pay (which currently covers the first six weeks of maternity leave), arguing that it would benefit the better off - which sounds as if it comes straight from the Treasury. Also disappointing is the fact that the paper is noticeably hesitant on the key issue of flexible hours on return to work. This is where parents' interests and those of business most clearly clash. Business has been howling at the possibility, playing the damage to small business card for all its worth. Mr Byers is bending as far as possible. The whole document is tilted towards winning over business: its subtitle is \"competitiveness and choice\". One of the first chapters is devoted to the benefits to business of improving provision.</p> <p>At the press conference, Baroness Margaret Jay, the minister for women, spelled it out: \"This is not an old-fashioned argument about rights but about the bottom line.\" She is wrong. This is an argument primarily about rights - the rights of babies and those who care for them. Those rights derive from our respect for the next generation and for those who have the responsibilities of nurturing small children. Far from old-fashioned, this should be the starting point of policy; the economic benefits while useful to the debate, come second. Happily, there is enough in this green paper to indicate that the government and Mr Byers have finally got the message.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/er/review.htm\" target=\"_new\">The green paper in full</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Campaigners for working parents are celebrating. Finally, after more than two decades, they have a green paper which honestly and sensibly confronts a debate about maternity and paternity leave. Britain has been left behind in Europe; many countries have long since outstripped us in the provisions made for new parents to care for their children. This is despite Britain having some of the highest rates of female participation in the labour market. The cost to the quality of family life and the well-being of babies is self-evident. All of this is generously acknowledged and backed up with detailed research in the Work and Parents green paper. The message, delivered by Stephen Byers yesterday, is clear: no change is not an option. That will help focus the minds of those businesses that persist in opposing any improvement. There are plenty of other goodies in this Christmas stocking - indeed something for everyone as is the wont of New Labour. They include the outlines of a package carefully designed to keep everyone sweet. It runs along the lines of: an increase in statutory maternity pay (SMP) from \u00a360.20 to around \u00a3100 a week, or an extension of maternity leave up to a year; men get two weeks paid paternity leave; business gets a generous exemption scheme on flexible working rights, plus plenty of help on administration costs and recruiting replacements to cover for maternity leave. They even recommend tackling anomalies such as adoptive parents not being entitled to leave and those women not eligible for maternity pay - such as student nurses. There are other interesting suggestions, including switching unpaid maternity leave between parents. This is all a huge step change in government thinking - remember only a few years ago, government laughed the idea of paid paternity leave out of court. But having paid credit where it is due, it is not churlish to point out some disturbing weaknesses. The most depressing is that it presents increasing SMP and lengthening leave as either/or alternatives. But one without the other is useless; women need longer leave, yet they will not take it unless they can afford it. Hopefully, this is just a slip of wording. The paper took a very dim view of extending earnings related pay (which currently covers the first six weeks of maternity leave), arguing that it would benefit the better off - which sounds as if it comes straight from the Treasury. Also disappointing is the fact that the paper is noticeably hesitant on the key issue of flexible hours on return to work. This is where parents' interests and those of business most clearly clash. Business has been howling at the possibility, playing the damage to small business card for all its worth. Mr Byers is bending as far as possible. The whole document is tilted towards winning over business: its subtitle is \"competitiveness and choice\". One of the first chapters is devoted to the benefits to business of improving provision. At the press conference, Baroness Margaret Jay, the minister for women, spelled it out: \"This is not an old-fashioned argument about rights but about the bottom line.\" She is wrong. This is an argument primarily about rights - the rights of babies and those who care for them. Those rights derive from our respect for the next generation and for those who have the responsibilities of nurturing small children. Far from old-fashioned, this should be the starting point of policy; the economic benefits while useful to the debate, come second. Happily, there is enough in this green paper to indicate that the government and Mr Byers have finally got the message. The green paper in full",

      "body": "<p>Yasser Arafat has ordered his militia commanders to stop shooting from Palestinian cities and towns because people are complaining of an unbearable toll in civilian deaths and suffering, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Faced with a growing public clamour to rethink his intifada strategy and pull back the gunmen, the Palestinian leader told his Fatah lieutenants on Wednesday to hold fire.</p> <p>In the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Jala, pummelled relentlessly by Israeli tank and machine-gun fire, Mr Arafat made an almost unheard of personal intervention, telephoning the Latin patriarch, Monsignor Michel Sabbah - the most senior representative of the Roman Catholic church in the Holy Land - to arrange a meeting with his Fatah area commander.</p> <p>Among Palestinians there is a deepening despair at the price the 10-week uprising has exacted from their community: the overwhelming majority of the 300 killed and 10,000 injured are Arab, half the population is out of work, and acres of Palestinian olive groves and farmland have been bulldozed by the Israeli army.</p> <p>There is also anger, and disillusionment. In the West Bank city of Nablus, a stronghold of Fatah militancy, militia leaders had already washed their hands of Mr Arafat's intifada: two weeks ago they laid down their guns in protest at corruption in his Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>Wednesday's extraordinary meeting in Beit Jala, a largely Christian Arab town, produced the most determined effort to stop the shooting in any of the areas under Mr Arafat's control. Mgr Sabbah and four local mayors came together with the Fatah area commander and reached a unanimous decision.</p> <p>\"It is not a military decision, or a political decision. It is a decision according to the needs of the people,\" said Kamal Hmeid, the Fatah commander for the Bethlehem region. \"Most of the Palestinian people want to continue with the intifada, but without the heavy losses and damages. They are saying in a loud voice: 'Please find a different way because we can not go on like this'.\"</p> <p>The order has also gone out from militia commanders in the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, and in Khan Yunus in the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>The effort to shield Palestinian civilians from further bloodshed is a delicate matter. The gunmen have no central command: Fatah militiamen are organised regionally, they owe their allegiance to local commanders and only indirectly to Mr Arafat, and they are swayed by local conditions.</p> <p>An Israeli military operation, such as further missile strikes or the assassination of militia leaders, could sabotage Mr Arafat's effort to steer the uprising along a less lethal course. Two previous orders to stop shooting from residential areas bought a few days of relative calm to Beit Jala and other towns, but then the bloodshed resumed.</p> <p>After Wednesday's meeting, Mr Hmeid mounted a vigil in Beit Jala, pleading with gangs of tanzim (militia) to follow the instructions. \"I know it is not easy to stop,\" he said.</p> <p>The decision to try to rein in Bethlehem's gunmen was forced on Mr Arafat by local people trapped between the Palestinian gunmen and the bombardment by Israeli tanks guarding the Jewish settlement of Gilo on the opposite ridge. The area's mayors and other notables besieged the Palestinian leader with faxes and public entreaties to stop the gunmen.</p> <p>\"There is no reason to use citizens' houses for this,\" said Raji Zeidan, mayor of Beit Jala, where 300 houses have been damaged by heavy Israeli fire. \"But at the same time we cannot justify Israel's action.\"</p> <p>People have intifada fatigue, ground down by the toll in human life and the economic cost of Israel's blockade of the West Bank and Gaza. Religious factors - the Muslim holy month of Ramada and the approach of Christmas for Christian Arabs - are also taking the fire out of the intifada.</p> <p>Now, as the uprising enters its eleventh week, two strategies are exhausted: the popular demonstrations by teenage stone-throwers confronting Israeli soldiers and the guerrilla-style actions by the militias operating from residential areas.</p> <p>\"The aim of the intifada is not to put pressure on the Palestinian people, because the Palestinian people are already suffering from siege and from hunger, and we do not want them to suffer more. That is why we took the decision to ease the situation,\" said Hussein Sheikh, who commands the Fatah militias in Ramallah.</p> <p>\"There is a tangible reduction in the level of confrontation. This intifada is taking the shape of waves, and the Palestinians are now thinking more about the quality of action.\"</p> <p>They are also thinking about the quality of their leaders. In the Balata refugee camp, on the edges of Nablus, the gunmen gave up on Mr Arafat's intifada two weeks ago, sensing that he was ready to reopen negotiations with Israel.

      "bodyText": "Yasser Arafat has ordered his militia commanders to stop shooting from Palestinian cities and towns because people are complaining of an unbearable toll in civilian deaths and suffering, the Guardian has learned. Faced with a growing public clamour to rethink his intifada strategy and pull back the gunmen, the Palestinian leader told his Fatah lieutenants on Wednesday to hold fire. In the Bethlehem suburb of Beit Jala, pummelled relentlessly by Israeli tank and machine-gun fire, Mr Arafat made an almost unheard of personal intervention, telephoning the Latin patriarch, Monsignor Michel Sabbah - the most senior representative of the Roman Catholic church in the Holy Land - to arrange a meeting with his Fatah area commander. Among Palestinians there is a deepening despair at the price the 10-week uprising has exacted from their community: the overwhelming majority of the 300 killed and 10,000 injured are Arab, half the population is out of work, and acres of Palestinian olive groves and farmland have been bulldozed by the Israeli army. There is also anger, and disillusionment. In the West Bank city of Nablus, a stronghold of Fatah militancy, militia leaders had already washed their hands of Mr Arafat's intifada: two weeks ago they laid down their guns in protest at corruption in his Palestinian Authority. Wednesday's extraordinary meeting in Beit Jala, a largely Christian Arab town, produced the most determined effort to stop the shooting in any of the areas under Mr Arafat's control. Mgr Sabbah and four local mayors came together with the Fatah area commander and reached a unanimous decision. \"It is not a military decision, or a political decision. It is a decision according to the needs of the people,\" said Kamal Hmeid, the Fatah commander for the Bethlehem region. \"Most of the Palestinian people want to continue with the intifada, but without the heavy losses and damages. They are saying in a loud voice: 'Please find a different way because we can not go on like this'.\" The order has also gone out from militia commanders in the West Bank cities of Hebron and Ramallah, and in Khan Yunus in the Gaza Strip. The effort to shield Palestinian civilians from further bloodshed is a delicate matter. The gunmen have no central command: Fatah militiamen are organised regionally, they owe their allegiance to local commanders and only indirectly to Mr Arafat, and they are swayed by local conditions. An Israeli military operation, such as further missile strikes or the assassination of militia leaders, could sabotage Mr Arafat's effort to steer the uprising along a less lethal course. Two previous orders to stop shooting from residential areas bought a few days of relative calm to Beit Jala and other towns, but then the bloodshed resumed. After Wednesday's meeting, Mr Hmeid mounted a vigil in Beit Jala, pleading with gangs of tanzim (militia) to follow the instructions. \"I know it is not easy to stop,\" he said. The decision to try to rein in Bethlehem's gunmen was forced on Mr Arafat by local people trapped between the Palestinian gunmen and the bombardment by Israeli tanks guarding the Jewish settlement of Gilo on the opposite ridge. The area's mayors and other notables besieged the Palestinian leader with faxes and public entreaties to stop the gunmen. \"There is no reason to use citizens' houses for this,\" said Raji Zeidan, mayor of Beit Jala, where 300 houses have been damaged by heavy Israeli fire. \"But at the same time we cannot justify Israel's action.\" People have intifada fatigue, ground down by the toll in human life and the economic cost of Israel's blockade of the West Bank and Gaza. Religious factors - the Muslim holy month of Ramada and the approach of Christmas for Christian Arabs - are also taking the fire out of the intifada. Now, as the uprising enters its eleventh week, two strategies are exhausted: the popular demonstrations by teenage stone-throwers confronting Israeli soldiers and the guerrilla-style actions by the militias operating from residential areas. \"The aim of the intifada is not to put pressure on the Palestinian people, because the Palestinian people are already suffering from siege and from hunger, and we do not want them to suffer more. That is why we took the decision to ease the situation,\" said Hussein Sheikh, who commands the Fatah militias in Ramallah. \"There is a tangible reduction in the level of confrontation. This intifada is taking the shape of waves, and the Palestinians are now thinking more about the quality of action.\" They are also thinking about the quality of their leaders. In the Balata refugee camp, on the edges of Nablus, the gunmen gave up on Mr Arafat's intifada two weeks ago, sensing that he was ready to reopen negotiations with Israel. They accuse him of being too eager to pick up the pieces of the fractured peace process. \"The intifada has already stopped,\" the Fatah area leader, Hussam Khader, said. \"We discovered everything will end up on the table and we will become the first names on the blacklist of the Palestinian Authority's most wanted men after he makes a deal. Why should we risk our lives for people to become rich?\" In the camps there is growing outrage at reports that 50 of the authority's senior officials left, or evacuated their families, from the West Bank and Gaza when the uprising began in late September. The reports have reawakened ordinary people's anger at their leaders' corruption. That resentment, put aside when the insurrection began, resurfaced this week in the West Bank and Gaza when authority staff got their salaries and found that they were paying an \"intifada tax\" of nearly 200 shekels (\u00a335). \"They have been taking money to help the people since 1996,\" an employee from Nablus said. \"So where is this money going, and why do they have to take something more now?\" In Hizme, a village in the shadow of a Jewish settlement on the northern edge of Jerusalem, Jalila Suleiman Salahaddin has been nursing her anger since November 3, when she buried her first-born son, Mahmoud Abdul Jawad Sayeed. \"The big guys, the leaders, they will buy cars, and they will buy villas, and will have a very happy life,\" she said. \"But we, we are the common people, and we will can do nothing but throw stones.

      "body": "<p>For many French people, Professor Robert Escarpit, who has died aged 82, was most famous as a regular commentator for the Paris daily, Le Monde. Between 1949 and 1979, some 9,000 of his regular, 200-word Au Jour le Jour front-page pieces appeared in the paper - and it was generally the piece that one read first.</p> <p>Sometimes, he considered a specific event. Thus, when Pierre Mend\u00e8s France's government was forced to resign in the mid-1950s, Escarpit pointed out that no one was happier than the comedians of the Paris music halls. Now they would be able to resume their mockery of the foolish and incompetent governments that succeeded one another. With Mend\u00e8s France in power, this had not been possible.</p> <p>Sometimes, Escarpit took the French as a whole to task. In 1970, he wrote that they pitied poor children dying in Biafra, India or Africa. The French had long sight, he observed. But the news of five Africans being killed in a fire at their workplace in a Paris suburb passed almost unnoticed. It was time, he concluded, for the French to put on their spectacles.</p> <p>Escarpit was a man of many accomplishments. He was both professor of English and professor of the science of information and communication at the University of Bordeaux, and, from 1975 to 1978, the university's president. He wrote some 70 books, including novels, texts on English literature and the sociology of literature, several works directed at young people, and a few widely-read essays on current affairs.</p> <p>Born at Saint-Macaire, in the Gironde, Escarpit entered \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1938. He studied English and, after the war, resolved to write a thesis on Byron. But then, in England, he took part in a discussion with Harold Nicolson and Peter Quennell, which hinged upon what Byron was doing at 5pm on a certain afternoon. He enjoyed their erudition, but turned away from this form of research.</p> <p>Escarpit became more interested in the sociology of literature and came to England to meet Richard Hoggart. When Birmingham University established its Centre for Cultural Studies, led by Hoggart, he decided that this was the result of Hoggart's defence in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial - and, afterwards, Escarpit always called the centre the \"Lady Chatterley institute\". But he created something similar in 1965, the Institut Litt\u00e9raire des techniques artistiques de masse, and, in 1967, another institute specialising in communication.</p> <p>Escarpit was always loyal to the Bordeaux region. He claimed that the Girondins had played a vital role in the revolution, as he claimed that the products of the region were by far the best. He always drank Bordeaux, and the story is told of how his son once persuaded him to try Burgundy. He drank a glass, then shook his head. \"Oh, no,\" he sighed, \"I prefer wine.\"</p> <p>He was also interested in politics. In 1936, aged 18, he played an active part in supporting the Popular Front government. He fought with the resistance in the M\u00e9doc, south of Bordeaux. After the war, he found himself drawn to the Communist party, although he never adhered to their adulation of Stalin. He was in favour of decolonisation, and wrote some satirical pieces in Le Monde for those who believed that Algeria would always be French. In 1986, he was elected to the regional council of Aquitaine, as an independent associated with the Communist party.</p> <p>At the time, his religious closeness to the Dominicans posed a problem. Typically, he resolved it by suggesting that God was a \"left-wing intellectual\".</p> <p>Escarpit enjoyed life; he claimed that he had never been bored.

      "bodyText": "For many French people, Professor Robert Escarpit, who has died aged 82, was most famous as a regular commentator for the Paris daily, Le Monde. Between 1949 and 1979, some 9,000 of his regular, 200-word Au Jour le Jour front-page pieces appeared in the paper - and it was generally the piece that one read first. Sometimes, he considered a specific event. Thus, when Pierre Mend\u00e8s France's government was forced to resign in the mid-1950s, Escarpit pointed out that no one was happier than the comedians of the Paris music halls. Now they would be able to resume their mockery of the foolish and incompetent governments that succeeded one another. With Mend\u00e8s France in power, this had not been possible. Sometimes, Escarpit took the French as a whole to task. In 1970, he wrote that they pitied poor children dying in Biafra, India or Africa. The French had long sight, he observed. But the news of five Africans being killed in a fire at their workplace in a Paris suburb passed almost unnoticed. It was time, he concluded, for the French to put on their spectacles. Escarpit was a man of many accomplishments. He was both professor of English and professor of the science of information and communication at the University of Bordeaux, and, from 1975 to 1978, the university's president. He wrote some 70 books, including novels, texts on English literature and the sociology of literature, several works directed at young people, and a few widely-read essays on current affairs. Born at Saint-Macaire, in the Gironde, Escarpit entered \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1938. He studied English and, after the war, resolved to write a thesis on Byron. But then, in England, he took part in a discussion with Harold Nicolson and Peter Quennell, which hinged upon what Byron was doing at 5pm on a certain afternoon. He enjoyed their erudition, but turned away from this form of research. Escarpit became more interested in the sociology of literature and came to England to meet Richard Hoggart. When Birmingham University established its Centre for Cultural Studies, led by Hoggart, he decided that this was the result of Hoggart's defence in the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trial - and, afterwards, Escarpit always called the centre the \"Lady Chatterley institute\". But he created something similar in 1965, the Institut Litt\u00e9raire des techniques artistiques de masse, and, in 1967, another institute specialising in communication. Escarpit was always loyal to the Bordeaux region. He claimed that the Girondins had played a vital role in the revolution, as he claimed that the products of the region were by far the best. He always drank Bordeaux, and the story is told of how his son once persuaded him to try Burgundy. He drank a glass, then shook his head. \"Oh, no,\" he sighed, \"I prefer wine.\" He was also interested in politics. In 1936, aged 18, he played an active part in supporting the Popular Front government. He fought with the resistance in the M\u00e9doc, south of Bordeaux. After the war, he found himself drawn to the Communist party, although he never adhered to their adulation of Stalin. He was in favour of decolonisation, and wrote some satirical pieces in Le Monde for those who believed that Algeria would always be French. In 1986, he was elected to the regional council of Aquitaine, as an independent associated with the Communist party. At the time, his religious closeness to the Dominicans posed a problem. Typically, he resolved it by suggesting that God was a \"left-wing intellectual\". Escarpit enjoyed life; he claimed that he had never been bored. It can certainly be said that, in all his writing and many activities, he was always intellectually honest and stimulating. He is survived by his wife and children.

The property includes a swimming pool with a wave machine, and a white sand beach. It also has a mini-theatre, a beauty salon and \"an industrial kitchen fit for a hotel\", he said.</p> <p>A second sprawling palatial home, purportedly bought for another of Mr Estrada's five known mistresses, had a master bedroom the size of \"the homes of 10 Philippine families\", Mr Arroyo claimed.</p> <p>The president's wealth is officially listed as being about \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>Mr Estrada, who remained at the presidential palace yesterday, is being tried on four counts: bribery, corruption, violating the constitution and betraying the public trust. The charges allege that he received \u00a37m in kickbacks from gambling syndicates and millions more from tobacco taxes and other sources, and that he appointed friends and relatives to high office.</p> <p>In a judicial process based on the US system used against Bill Clinton, the votes of at least 15 of the 22 senators are required to secure a conviction and force him from office. The trial is expected to last until mid-January.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the prosecution has enough support among the senators, who include an ex-basketball star, a retired general, a former coup leader and several former actors. One read a book for much of the opening statements while another chatted on his mobile phone.</p> <p>In the two hours allotted for its opening remarks, the defence decried the prosecution's \"lies and innuendo\" and likened Mr Estrada to the Roman emperor Julius Caesar, who was stabbed in the senate by former supporters.</p> <p>Even if the president survives the trial, his position may be made untenable by mounting popular opposition. At least 30,000 of his opponents, led by former president Corazon Aquino, the current vice-president Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, and the Catholic archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jamie Sin, marched around the senate building yesterday.</p> <p>Ms Aquino, who became president after the 1986 \"people's power\" revolution which drove out the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, urged Mr Estrada to resign immediately to spare the country a drawn-out impeachment trial.</p> <p>\"A president who cares about his people more than he cares about himself would not have put his nation through this agonising and potentially divisive crisis,\" she said.</p> <p>Since the crisis erupted in October, the economy has nose-dived, the currency has lost more than 10% of its value, the stock market has plunged and foreign investment has dried up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arguments over opulent mansions occupied by a string of mistresses, a copy of an alleged multimillion-pound kickback cheque, and a march past by tens of thousands of protesters marked yesterday's opening of the impeachment trial of President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines. As supporters and opponents of the beleaguered former movie star rallied outside the senate in Manila, congressmen acting as prosecutors opened their case by accusing him of running a \"criminal syndicate from the highest office of the land\". With a flourish Joker Arroyo produced a copy of a cheque for 142m pesos (\u00a32.1m) which he claimed was signed by the president, using a false name, to hide assets in secret accounts. \"Imagine the president of the Philippines maintaining a fictitious account? he said. \"That is how low the president has gone in bastardising and prostituting our banking system.\" He suggested that Mr Estrada had used the money to buy a million-pound mansion for Laarni Enriquez, one of his three starlet mistresses and the mother of three of his dozen children. The property includes a swimming pool with a wave machine, and a white sand beach. It also has a mini-theatre, a beauty salon and \"an industrial kitchen fit for a hotel\", he said. A second sprawling palatial home, purportedly bought for another of Mr Estrada's five known mistresses, had a master bedroom the size of \"the homes of 10 Philippine families\", Mr Arroyo claimed. The president's wealth is officially listed as being about \u00a3500,000. Mr Estrada, who remained at the presidential palace yesterday, is being tried on four counts: bribery, corruption, violating the constitution and betraying the public trust. The charges allege that he received \u00a37m in kickbacks from gambling syndicates and millions more from tobacco taxes and other sources, and that he appointed friends and relatives to high office. In a judicial process based on the US system used against Bill Clinton, the votes of at least 15 of the 22 senators are required to secure a conviction and force him from office. The trial is expected to last until mid-January. It is unclear whether the prosecution has enough support among the senators, who include an ex-basketball star, a retired general, a former coup leader and several former actors. One read a book for much of the opening statements while another chatted on his mobile phone. In the two hours allotted for its opening remarks, the defence decried the prosecution's \"lies and innuendo\" and likened Mr Estrada to the Roman emperor Julius Caesar, who was stabbed in the senate by former supporters. Even if the president survives the trial, his position may be made untenable by mounting popular opposition. At least 30,000 of his opponents, led by former president Corazon Aquino, the current vice-president Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, and the Catholic archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Jamie Sin, marched around the senate building yesterday. Ms Aquino, who became president after the 1986 \"people's power\" revolution which drove out the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, urged Mr Estrada to resign immediately to spare the country a drawn-out impeachment trial. \"A president who cares about his people more than he cares about himself would not have put his nation through this agonising and potentially divisive crisis,\" she said. Since the crisis erupted in October, the economy has nose-dived, the currency has lost more than 10% of its value, the stock market has plunged and foreign investment has dried up.",

      "body": "<p>The last time I saw Ethan Hawke, he was pinned to the wall between Matt Dillon and Christian Slater, the poster boys of Jackie magazine's golden age. Dillon and Slater were rebels in leather, Hawke was the worthy one. The name Ethan made him sound wispy and mysterious and capable of understanding that, whilst we were committed to adolescence, there were certain childhood loyalties for which we would drop him and run. </p> <p>Twelve years later he is sitting beside me in a Munich hotel room, sporting ugly black boots and a feathery beard. He isn't the luminous boy I remember from the posters: the toff in Dead Poets Society, the animal lover in White Fang, the sidekick to River Phoenix in Explorers. </p> <p>In the late afternoon sun he looks quite drab, dwarfed by the suite's grand furnishings and fiddling compulsively with the boots. There's still a grunge thing going on, with his long hair and dark layers of clothing. He looks like a student who hasn't seen enough daylight. Then he gives a little Ethan smile, shrugs his Ethan shoulders and is suddenly recognisable as the orb of my 12th year. </p> <p>\"I sometimes think I'm so boring,\" he sighs winsomely. \"I'll read an article about how Bob Dylan manipulated his image, put on these false personas, pretended he was like Woody Guthrie, and I think, what's the obligation in an interview to play into some mystique? But if you do, I think you end up dead.\" (Worthiness like this pays off: while Dillon and Slater dropped out of the race years ago, Hawke married Uma Thurman. They have a baby daughter, Maya Ray Thurman-Hawke.) </p> <p>At 30, Hawke is the lead in a new film version of Hamlet. Set in modern-day Manhattan, it has Claudius as the CEO of a multinational company, the Denmark Corporation, Hamlet as a petulant young film-maker and Gertrude as a champagne-swilling lush. They inhabit the Elsinore Hotel, a Trump Tower-type complex the size of a small Scandinavian country. There is some clever visual trickery - security cameras, camcorders, televisions, to engineer the layered effect of Shakespeare's play within the play - and it's a fun adaptation. </p> <p>The shock of seeing Hollywood do Hamlet was absorbed 10 years ago, when Franco Zeffirelli cast Mel Gibson as the prince in a production that gave us Glenn Close gnashing her teeth as Gertrude, and Helena Bonham Carter as a cadaverous Ophelia. This is a more modest film, featuring Kyle MacLachlan as Claudius, Sam Shepard as the ghost and Bill Murray as a mighty uncomfortable-looking Polonius, who delivers his lines with the regret of an actor who knows they won't get the laughs he's accustomed to. </p> <p>Mercifully, after Kenneth Branagh's four-hour epic, the film's director, Michael Almereyda, cut the play to an hour and a half (\"I don't know if this is sacrilege or whatever,\" offers Hawke, \"but I believe that if Shakespeare were alive today, he would make some cuts\"); and drew from his principal a performance that hovers between the understated and the sulky. At the time of shooting, Hawke was 27, and played the prince as a modish, MTV-educated sophisticate, loping down Fifth Avenue in a Peruvian hat and sunglasses and delivering the \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy in a Blockbuster video store. </p> <p>\"A lot of American actors when they do Shakespeare put on a phoney English accent and it drives me crazy,\" he says. \"You're always fighting against the idea that only the British know how to do Shakespeare. One of the things I liked about this was that it was set in New York so I didn't have to pretend.\" </p> <p>His and Almereyda's motivation for doing the play was the belief that the actors who have played Hamlet in the past have been too old. \"I've always thought that he was a young man,\" says Hawke. \"There was a great Holden Caulfield line, you know, from Catcher in the Rye, about how he saw Laurence Olivier play Hamlet and thought he was pretty good in the duelling scenes but played him more like a goddamn general and less like the sad, screwed-up kind of guy that I always thought he was. </p> <p>\"The common takes on Hamlet - that he's indecisive and self-involved - make more sense with a young man playing the part. I think he's really not indecisive at all. He just happens to be a very... ah... moral person who doesn't take the idea of killing somebody lightly. I think there is a much stronger case to be made that he should never have killed Claudius and it's the story of a person losing their morality and getting lost in the power his father holds over him.\" </p> <p>Hawke spent the summer before filming attending three study sessions a week with a friend who had played the part on the stage. \"First off, just to understand everything you're saying takes a couple of months. And then to try to articulate it - one of the things I've loved about Olivier is that whenever he speaks the verse, I always know what he means. He was, like, 40 years old when he played it, he had such a deep understanding of the language he could lead an audience through it. I just wanted to do it as simply as possible. Oftentimes I think that Shakespeare can be filled with lots of histrionics; Hamlet can encourage the best of actors to overact.\" </p> <p>Wasn't that John Gielgud playing on a screen in the background of one scene? \"Yeah, that's him, which is kinda neat, because he passed away the same week that the movie came out in the US.\" </p> <p>For a while in the 1990s, Hawke looked on course for a different kind of career. His success in Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society and Ben Stiller's grunge tribute Reality Bites, in which he played opposite Winona Ryder, marked him out as a promising young thing soon to be whisked into superstardom like his childhood friend, River Phoenix. Hawke says he never wanted to be a movie star (\"I never wanted to be Jimmy Stewart\"), a common enough line among actors who haven't got there, but in Hawke's case authenticated by his unorthodox career moves. Twice during his 20s he took a two-year leave of absence, once to go to NYU and study English (he dropped out when a part came up), and then to write a novel. In each case he says he was testing himself to see if acting was just a phase, and in each case he returned to it with modified expectations. </p> <p>\"After Reality Bites came out, I had opportunities to be a different kind of actor, and rightly or wrongly\" - he agonises for a moment - \"I grew up in a household where there was such anger and resentment towards anyone who had any money, that I never really had any desire to make any money. And I had the idea that a real artist wouldn't have any money. That's been problematic.\" </p> <p>Does he retain those romantic notions? </p> <p>\"I do.\" He beams. \"But I fell in love with a very glamorous woman who battles them.\" </p> <p>Hawke grew up in a single-parent family in New Jersey and at 14, after being spotted in a school production of Saint Joan, was cast alongside River Phoenix in the endearing children's film Explorers. \"Acting was something that came very easily to me. It fell in my lap. But the people I admired the most were not really movie stars. I was full of Jack London and Jack Kerouac.\" </p> <p>At 18, he came under the influence of Peter Weir and, he says, was blown away by Dead Poets Society. \"The experience on that movie was, for lack of a better term, life-altering. Weir has a unique talent for making movies that are intelligent but also mainstream. I've never been terribly successful at doing that.\" </p> <p> Hawke is relaxed about his shortcomings (\"Some people may be more natural actors than I am, they can just perform and perform. And I can get kind of frazzled\") and generous to his fellow actors. Of Jude Law, with whom he acted in the sci-fi movie Gattaca, he says: \"I think Jude's the real thing. He is just electric, man. He is so beautiful. It's weird to be around someone that beautiful. I just couldn't believe he was straight.\" But there's a frown of concentration on his face when he delivers the spiel about being happy with his lot. </p> <p>\"Every now and then I suffer a little envy. I feel that if I had been more ambitious in a different way... But then I'm really fortunate that my interests take me in a bunch of different places and I really enjoy it. It's easy to let other people convince you that life is like a race. But there really is no finishing line. Nobody does win. With that in mind, I always feel that, if your north star is your own personal development, you can't go wrong.\" </p> <p>This sounds like an attitude he's had to work at. \"It is. It's so hard not to get sucked up into comparing yourself to other people. It's one of the hardest things in the world.\" Then: \"I was friends with River Phoenix, you know, and I used to be painfully jealous of him. Until a friend pointed out that him doing well doesn't mean that you're doing badly. And if he does badly, it doesn't mean you're doing better. It's like that great Gore Vidal line, 'Whenever a friend of mine succeeds, a small part of me dies.' Being an adult is really challenging. When you're young, you can rely for so long on being promising, and then you have to stop being promising. You want to say, 'Hey, can't I be promising any more?' \" </p> <p>He has written a second novel, directed an art film called Chelsea Walls, which, he says proudly, \"has no narrative\", and is wise enough to pay for these luxuries by turning in the occasional regular film. In January he starts shooting on a Hollywood number with Denzel Washington - Training Day, a rookie cop drama. \"Greasing the franchise,\" he smiles. </p> <p>But his passions lie elsewhere, in the low-budget movies and the writing career that he pursues with the zeal of the autodidact. He goes on about his failure to combine the commercial with the experimental, but that's what he's done really, taking his mainstream face away from the centrefolds towards the things that inspire him. His enthusiasm is infectious. </p> <p>\"I've always thought that I'd love to see Quentin Tarantino do Julius Caesar. Wouldn't that be great? That would be so exciting. That would be awesome.\" </p> <p> \u0095 Hamlet is released next Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The area around San Jose, Almeria, with its red earth and deep, wide basins scooped out of the slopes of interlacing mountain chains, has long been the choice of film-makers who could not afford the hard dollar. It is spaghetti western country, the backdrop for Once Upon a Time in the West and Sabato. Standing in the dusty winds you can almost see the tumbleweed tumble. It was these winds that etched the first wrinkles on young Clint Eastwood's blank phizog. </p> <p>A few days before I arrive on the set of Paul McGuigan's new film, Morality Play, the winds once again cost a film company a few dollars more. The catering tent, complete with a spread for 200 people, rose from its moorings, drifted through the sky like a drunken magic carpet and flopped into the Mediterranean. The crew, driving up the shifty roads from San Jose, saw the whole thing. </p> <p>The incident did not augur well for the stability of the mock-up medieval town that has been built of wood and polystyrene and plaster on the flank of a steep mountain. The point is reinforced when, making my way up the slithery hill-face to the castle of the Lord de Guise past peasant hovels, candle-makers' and bakers' shops and leering graven images, a piece of faux medieval England, seven by seven - presumably sent by his malevolent lordship - whacks me, unshriven, across the shoulders. </p> <p>As it turns out, the set holds up well against the winds and stomping boots of cast and crew and scores of extras. Walking around it, you are constantly being tricked by the decor, even at close quarters. I am startled when a standing stone figure (actually made of polystyrene and plaster) quivers in the breeze; but when I give the \"stone\" wall of the graveyard a friendly punch it grazes my knuckles. The top layer of rocks is real, only the base was plywood. The tallow candles hanging in the peasants' shop are real, made in the ancient way. And, carrying realism to its extreme, the peasants' whetstone in the market place is in working order. </p> <p>I do not realise it at the moment, but as I climb for sanctuary from the winds into the church - which tops the hill with the castle, overlooking the peasants below to symbolise arrogant dominance - I am looking at bits of a Welsh castle. </p> <p>Alan Chester, the set construction manager, explains how this piece of foul, plague-ridden England has miraculously appeared on a Spanish mountainside. He has been involved in scenic construction since he started in the days of the Rank organisation 27 years ago. His last big job was the TV adaptation of Mervyn Peake's gothic fantasy Gormenghast. </p> <p>With 19 experienced British film carpenters, painters and riggers, and another 50 Spaniards, they set up a huge workshop on the mountainside. It took them nine weeks. \"The moulds came from Harlech Castle,\" says Chester. \"We took 'squeezes' from the actual castle in Snowdonia. The castings can then be applied to the flatlage (panels of plywood or timber to which moulds are affixed). The moulds are originally taken in clay then impressions are made in fibreglass and then made in plaster. We call the men 'fibrous plasterers' because they are not just plasterers who would do a room, but people who can make cornices and work in hard plaster.\" </p> <p>They made the casts in Shepperton studios, he says, and transported them and the screeds - guides to thickness of plaster - to Spain. They also took about 1,500 fibre sheets of various types of brickwork, each about seven feet square. \"The castle is about 60 feet high. We gave them a coat of plaster to make them look more like stone and then painted over them.\" For the peasants' hovels below they used real logs, timber that had to be shipped from Granada. </p> <p>During the time I spend on the set, they wait three days for the winds to calm before daring to shoot the climax, in which the castle itself is burned down. This involves setting off eight fire rockets while a 200 foot crane shoots the scene from on high. </p> <p> Unsworth's story is set in a 14th-century English village, which lives in fear of the Church and is plagued by priests and heartless nobles. It was a time when the dark side of paganism still left its mark on everyday life. Gargoyles and leering salaciousness were in order. This is taken care of by Stephen Hicklin, a scenic sculptor who worked on The Draughtsman's Contract. Hicklin is also a fine arts portrait sculptor, but he says he is \"often tempted by the broader palette of scenic sculpture\". He recently sculpted a Treasure Island frieze for a casino in Las Vegas. </p> <p>He is responsible for the plaster lady in a graveyard niche who is nursing Freudian snakes. She had a masculine counterpart - boasting impressive phallic equipment - until a week ago when someone on the set found it too tempting and nicked it. Hicklin also sculpted the crucifixes for the church. </p> <p>\"I worked in polystyrene,\" he says. \"Speed really was the factor. We had to work at breakneck pace because it was during the petrol strike and we had to get all the stuff on the lorry and down to Spain as quickly as possible.\" </p> <p>\"The pagan figures,\" he says, \"are based on Celtic designs, but the crucifixes are more Russian icon style. We needed a very eclectic flavour. These days what was once scenic carving is often done by computer technology. But the craft is not dead yet.\" </p> <p>Russian iconography was a happy choice, since most of the extras are refugees from Russia and the Baltic states who are fruit picking in the area. Pale-faced, they are considered to look more English than Spanish. There is an even more unusual job assignment process: 25 of the carpenters and painters working on the set are convicts from Almeria jail. They are granted three days remission of sentence for every day they work on the set. </p> <p>\"You want to warm the heart of what you are doing,\" Andrew McAlpine, the film's production designer says, \"by getting the local community involved.\" </p> <p>McAlpine, production designer on The Beach, Clockers and The Piano, is also co-designer of the interior of the body in the Millennium Dome. He and his team delivered 167 pages of architectural drawings to create the world McGuigan needed for his medieval, plague-threatened town. </p> <p>\"We looked everywhere for a suitable site,\" McAlpine says. \"We looked in Cumbria, Scotland, former Yugoslavia. We nearly settled for an old mine in Derbyshire, but thank God we didn't or we would be under water by now.\" </p> <p>In the end they chose the San Jose setting, the site of an old open-cast gold mine; its huge rinsing basins serve as courtyards and village squares. </p> <p>\"With Paul our ambition was to make a big, old-fashioned film,\" McAlpine continues. \"Something like A Man for All Seasons or The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The British have got stuck with kitchen sink drama or gangsters, which is OK. But we wanted a big film.\" </p> <p>An unfamiliar touch is that the castle they build is permanently surrounded by scaffolding. \"I showed to Paul the famous drawing of the Louvre being built with the scaffolding still on. The Morality Play story would have taken place at a point where there would have been social expansion. The custom that meant the lord's soldiers and their horses were all kept within the battlements - which must have been pretty uncomfortable - would have been changing. They would be moving out. The scaffolding that we've built is to indicate this expansion. But also it serves the idea of making a web around the castle, masking who is behind it.\" </p> <p>These are the kind of symbols that audiences would need crib sheets from Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma to spot. But it demonstrates the degree of absorption in their craft film-makers can work themselves into. </p> <p>McGuigan himself has done more than direct Gangster No 1, one of the technically slickest and most sickeningly vicious of modern gangster films. He has a background in documentary which is quite useful when realistically re-creating an ancient period. He does not scorn 30-foot crane shots and tracking on rails, but there is also a lot of hand-held camera work. </p> <p>\"In all the intimate scenes between the players,\" he says,\"I went for the M*A*S*H effect - four or six people in shot with a lot of milling about.\" </p> <p>The mysterious atmosphere infecting this fictitious world is only heightened by the fact that during the time I am there all activity shifts from day to night shooting. By day, the castle, church and peasant hovels stare dumbly in pale light from the mountainside, totally abandoned - as if the plague had really galloped through. There are onslaughts by snow machines that pour out wet shredded paper - dampened to help it fall rather than drift, but disagreeably sharp when it gets into your eyeballs and up your nostrils. </p> <p>But by night the rutted roads to the set are full of shadowy figures in animal skins or svelte young women with cellphones on the go. A creature will suddenly appear from behind a caravan and materialise into the terrifying, shark-mouthed figure of Willem Dafoe (who plays Martin, leader of the players). In the courtyard, awaiting a hanging, powerful Slavonic figures waited in defensive clusters, like Native Americans surrendering to the US cavalry. Suddenly little Stuart Wells (who plays the troupe's female impersonator) will dance out and take a flashlit shot of someone. </p> <p>During the early stages of the film's development, though, there was obviously a tussle between what Unsworth's book provided and what cinema needs to deliver. There was a general consensus that the book \"lacked a third act\". Through most of its length the book persuades the reader that it is primarily interested in the birth of modern theatre, here put to the service of a topical social problem - how justice can be achieved by the most lowly - and with an interesting emphasis on mime. But in the end all this is abruptly abandoned and the fish-bone of the book - a dressed-up detective story - is exposed. The killer is unmasked, but not yet brought to book; the King's Justice sends the players off, telling them he will deal with judicial and political matters. It is too lame an ending for the cinema. </p> <p>Rewriting had been near continuous before the shoot. One major change was brought about by the personality and potential of Gangster No 1's Paul Bettany, cast as a renegade priest who joins the players. \"We changed the ending because of what Paul was doing,\" McGuigan says. \"I felt we were missing out and we needed something special.\" </p> <p>The question is: which of the themes will survive and at the cost of what? Will it end up as an eloquent paean to human courage and compassion, a commitment to justice - or just a period detective yarn? Not even those most closely involved will know for certain where the weight will fall. </p> <p>Among the strolling players is Simon McBurney, carrying his intensity like a torch. The founder of the Theatre de Complicite is also the deviser of the three plays-within-a-play in the film. </p> <p>\"What we think of as mime or mimicry,\" McBurney says, \"can in real life often be amusing, but when it is examined close up through the lens of a camera it can appear theatrical. There will be some physical comedy in the film, but there was never any idea of doing a Marcel Marceau.\" </p> <p>McGuigan tells me that to insure against \"making a cheesy movie\" he cast Willem Dafoe as Martin, leader of the troupe who pushes them to the crucial confrontation. \"I wanted someone who would bring something edgy to the part,\" he says. </p> <p>Dafoe, a useful talent to have around, sits in his caravan. Draped in a great, trailing, bug-bitten bear's skin, his great shark grimace can be intimidating, but everyone has assured me he is a nice guy; and nowhere during the encounter did he display any of a Hollywood star's airs - either arrogance or false humility. Indeed the man who illuminated so many powerful films - Born on the 4th of July, Platoon, Wild at Heart - gives the impression of not really believing he is a star. He seems quite chuffed when, my brain seared by the sirocco winds of Almeria, I completely forget his previous involvements with European directors Wim Wenders (Faraway So Close) and Anthony Minghella (The English Patient). </p> <p>I ask him what he sees in Martin's character. He is cagey in his reply. \"I am not good at talking about how a character is. It's not superstition, it's not so much about process. I often don't have an inkling when I am approaching, inhabiting a character. I am just trying to help Paul to tell a story. Some people are good at that, I am not.\" </p> <p>Had he seen his director's previous film, the undeniably vicious Gangster No 1? \"I happened to be in Europe at the time,\" he says, \"and I saw Gangster in conjunction with the acting offer - it was a kind of calling card. The thing that impressed me was that it had a lot of style and it was a world realised very deeply. I knew he would be very good with creating a world. When I heard Paul came from documentary that interested me. It was a hedge against this being a costume drama. It is interesting if you apply that kind of sensibility to a fiction movie\". </p> <p>Is there any possibility he might also be contributing something to the direction here? </p> <p>He assures me he has never had an ambition to direct. \"But as I am getting older,\" he says, \"I start working with directors who are younger and inexperienced and sometimes - I am not talking about Paul - sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and get involved, which makes you feel you are directing.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think it is in my personality to direct,\" he says. \"There is a pleasure in being an agent of someone else's desires. It allows you to be more creative and pretend with a wider range of impulse\". </p> <p>When we leave the caravan for the dark of the trailer park a great coltish figure in rags flung himself at Dafoe and gives him a strangling embrace. \"Willem! Willem!\" he cries. \"You must autograph the script for this nice extra who wants to collect the autographs of the whole cast. You know the nice, dark one?\" </p> <p>\"There are a lot of nice ones,\" Dafoe says. </p> <p>The colt hopping about on stork legs is Paul Bettany. Red-nosed and sniffly, he has nothing of the terrifying psychopath he played in Gangster No 1. This was more the blond, public schoolboy Steerforth, the cad he played so well in the American TV adaptation of David Copperfield. But Bettany has a terrible cold and when obliged to lie beside an open grave for repeated takes will every now and then lift his boots knee-high in thumping jumps to restore circulation. </p> <p>Rewriting Bettany's role gives the film a very different ending to the book; the focus moves from Dafoe's troupe leader Martin to Bettany's renegade priest. In the novel, Nicholas is the most despised of the players, acting as the narrator. He is more a timorous witness of bold defiance than powerful participant. </p> <p>Not wishing to spoil the story, we will just say that the plot needed an articulate hero who nobly takes on the vicious Lord de Guise in a verbal duel. Paul Bettany sees this role as that of \"the man in Tiananmen Square who stood in front of the tank.\" </p> <p>The end of this magnificent set comes after three nights waiting, cowering in creaking tents, before dangerous gales. The 200-foot camera cranes swing into action; the hand-held cameras go in - \" Go, Go, Go! \" - and the medieval town they spent so long building goes up in flames. </p> <p> \u0095 Morality Play is due to be released next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The area around San Jose, Almeria, with its red earth and deep, wide basins scooped out of the slopes of interlacing mountain chains, has long been the choice of film-makers who could not afford the hard dollar. It is spaghetti western country, the backdrop for Once Upon a Time in the West and Sabato. Standing in the dusty winds you can almost see the tumbleweed tumble. It was these winds that etched the first wrinkles on young Clint Eastwood's blank phizog. A few days before I arrive on the set of Paul McGuigan's new film, Morality Play, the winds once again cost a film company a few dollars more. The catering tent, complete with a spread for 200 people, rose from its moorings, drifted through the sky like a drunken magic carpet and flopped into the Mediterranean. The crew, driving up the shifty roads from San Jose, saw the whole thing. The incident did not augur well for the stability of the mock-up medieval town that has been built of wood and polystyrene and plaster on the flank of a steep mountain. The point is reinforced when, making my way up the slithery hill-face to the castle of the Lord de Guise past peasant hovels, candle-makers' and bakers' shops and leering graven images, a piece of faux medieval England, seven by seven - presumably sent by his malevolent lordship - whacks me, unshriven, across the shoulders. As it turns out, the set holds up well against the winds and stomping boots of cast and crew and scores of extras. Walking around it, you are constantly being tricked by the decor, even at close quarters. I am startled when a standing stone figure (actually made of polystyrene and plaster) quivers in the breeze; but when I give the \"stone\" wall of the graveyard a friendly punch it grazes my knuckles. The top layer of rocks is real, only the base was plywood. The tallow candles hanging in the peasants' shop are real, made in the ancient way. And, carrying realism to its extreme, the peasants' whetstone in the market place is in working order. I do not realise it at the moment, but as I climb for sanctuary from the winds into the church - which tops the hill with the castle, overlooking the peasants below to symbolise arrogant dominance - I am looking at bits of a Welsh castle. Alan Chester, the set construction manager, explains how this piece of foul, plague-ridden England has miraculously appeared on a Spanish mountainside. He has been involved in scenic construction since he started in the days of the Rank organisation 27 years ago. His last big job was the TV adaptation of Mervyn Peake's gothic fantasy Gormenghast. With 19 experienced British film carpenters, painters and riggers, and another 50 Spaniards, they set up a huge workshop on the mountainside. It took them nine weeks. \"The moulds came from Harlech Castle,\" says Chester. \"We took 'squeezes' from the actual castle in Snowdonia. The castings can then be applied to the flatlage (panels of plywood or timber to which moulds are affixed). The moulds are originally taken in clay then impressions are made in fibreglass and then made in plaster. We call the men 'fibrous plasterers' because they are not just plasterers who would do a room, but people who can make cornices and work in hard plaster.\" They made the casts in Shepperton studios, he says, and transported them and the screeds - guides to thickness of plaster - to Spain. They also took about 1,500 fibre sheets of various types of brickwork, each about seven feet square. \"The castle is about 60 feet high. We gave them a coat of plaster to make them look more like stone and then painted over them.\" For the peasants' hovels below they used real logs, timber that had to be shipped from Granada. During the time I spend on the set, they wait three days for the winds to calm before daring to shoot the climax, in which the castle itself is burned down. This involves setting off eight fire rockets while a 200 foot crane shoots the scene from on high. Unsworth's story is set in a 14th-century English village, which lives in fear of the Church and is plagued by priests and heartless nobles. It was a time when the dark side of paganism still left its mark on everyday life. Gargoyles and leering salaciousness were in order. This is taken care of by Stephen Hicklin, a scenic sculptor who worked on The Draughtsman's Contract. Hicklin is also a fine arts portrait sculptor, but he says he is \"often tempted by the broader palette of scenic sculpture\". He recently sculpted a Treasure Island frieze for a casino in Las Vegas. He is responsible for the plaster lady in a graveyard niche who is nursing Freudian snakes. She had a masculine counterpart - boasting impressive phallic equipment - until a week ago when someone on the set found it too tempting and nicked it. Hicklin also sculpted the crucifixes for the church. \"I worked in polystyrene,\" he says. \"Speed really was the factor. We had to work at breakneck pace because it was during the petrol strike and we had to get all the stuff on the lorry and down to Spain as quickly as possible.\" \"The pagan figures,\" he says, \"are based on Celtic designs, but the crucifixes are more Russian icon style. We needed a very eclectic flavour. These days what was once scenic carving is often done by computer technology. But the craft is not dead yet.\" Russian iconography was a happy choice, since most of the extras are refugees from Russia and the Baltic states who are fruit picking in the area. Pale-faced, they are considered to look more English than Spanish. There is an even more unusual job assignment process: 25 of the carpenters and painters working on the set are convicts from Almeria jail. They are granted three days remission of sentence for every day they work on the set. \"You want to warm the heart of what you are doing,\" Andrew McAlpine, the film's production designer says, \"by getting the local community involved.\" McAlpine, production designer on The Beach, Clockers and The Piano, is also co-designer of the interior of the body in the Millennium Dome.

      "bodyText": "It is a sign of change that isolationist Switzerland, which is not a member or an immediate candidate, was invited to join the European Union's enlargement chat at the Nice summit yesterday. Then again, it is the EU's second largest trading partner. While the president, Adolf Ogi, a skiing fanatic, lobbied his EU counterparts, thousands of Genevans were preparing to start the winter sports season in the French Alps instead of a tidy Swiss resort. Many more will hop into France this weekend on a shopping trip, a common practice in border regions throughout western Europe. Yet, even the most pro-European Swiss are willing to pay a price to enjoy their neighbour's virtues without the strings. Border posts collect duties from those returning with too much shopping. The Swiss juggle with cheese, meat and wine quotas with the same aplomb as cross-Channel shoppers used to play with duty free allowances. Switzerland is likely to remain the hole in the middle of the European map, well after countries like Poland or Hungary have joined. In Nice, Mr Ogi asked for time, even though his government, a four-party coalition that spans the political spectrum, hopes to start negotiations with Brussels between 2004 and 2007. Previous attempts ground to a halt eight years ago when Swiss voters narrowly rejected closer trade ties with the EU in a referendum. Last May, 67% approved a series of bilateral deals that help business with the EU, including the free movement of labour. But it was largely due to government assurances that they were not a stepping stone for the political trappings of integration. The biggest obstacles are Mr Ogi's own Swiss-German community - two-thirds of the population - and his party, the Swiss People's Party, which is now dominated by isolationist right-wingers, and is the largest in parliament with 23% of seats. Progress is stifled by a complicated political system that ensures that voters can have a say at every stage of the process through referenda, even if parliament has approved it. Support is propped up by the overwhelmingly pro-European French-speaking community in western Switzerland - one-fifth of the population - and a few major cities. Public opinion is now split in half, and wavers with crises in Brussels and demands that the Swiss scrap banking secrecy. Swiss-German Eurosceptics bear an uncanny resemblance to their British counterparts: they fear meddling by Brussels, the loss of national identity, and they have a latent, historic loathing of Germany. Forty years ago, Switzerland set up the European Free Trade Association with Britain and a few Nordic countries to counter the EEC's growing power. Some of the controversial issues, such as allowing heavier EU trucks onto Swiss roads, resemble those that delayed Britain's entry into the EEC. And forget about strengthening the Euro with the Swiss Franc. It is deep-rooted reluctance. Apart from the Vatican, Switzerland is the only country in the world not to have joined the United Nations, although that might change soon. The same spirit applies within the country. One hundred and fifty years ago, the Swiss ensured that power was devolved as much as possible. Direct democracy cannot work if the Swiss are obliged to accept legislation decided by majority voting in Brussels. Yesterday, the president of Europe's wealthiest nation lectured his 22 European counterparts about the \"Swiss model\". Modern Switzerland is a miniature EU, formed by 26 states. Each canton has its own cabinet and parliament, as well as a judiciary, a police force, health and education system, and raises most taxes. The four linguistic communities are guaranteed a say at national level. Jos\u00e9 Bessard, of the Swiss government's integration office, thinks the EU should adopt referenda. \"Why couldn't Europe examine the possibility of a European initiative where a certain number of citizens from one or two or more countries can demand something from the EU? \"That would be a bottom up approach and not only something from the top\". It may be the price to pay for an estimated \u00a31.6bn in Swiss taxpayer's contributions, but later in the century.

But actually this movie is an engaging drama - improbable sometimes, yes, and occasionally absurd. But it has stylish and elegant performances from Cate Blanchett and John Turturro and is handsomely photographed by Sacha Vierney in colour tones at once rich and sepia-like. </p> <p>Christina Ricci plays a young Jewish girl in late 1920s Russia who is separated from her beloved father after being burned out of their village. She ends up in Paris as a dancer with a new Anglicised name, \"Suzie\", just in time for the Nazi occupation. </p> <p>There she meets Lola (Cate Blanchett) an angular, statuesque Russian, who becomes Suzie's pouting, giggling confidante. Blanchett suggests a Sally Bowles-like figure who yearns for a rich man - and finds one in the form of John Turturro's Dante, a petulant Italian opera singer who collaborates enthusiastically with the Nazis. </p> <p>Both Blanchett and Turturro carry off the roles with entertaining brio - and Blanchett especially has a gloriously expressive face on camera. But we are clearly given to understand that their campy bohemian loquaciousness is a sign of being lesser moral entities than Ricci, with her wise and moon-faced silences. </p> <p>Which brings us to the man she is in love with: Johnny Depp as Cesar, the smoulderingly dishy Gypsy musician with some sexy but carefully placed scars, who conducts her to his Gypsy encampment for the mandatory scene in which his family welcome her instinctively for a sing-song. Depp looks silly and self-conscious and just doesn't cut the mustard in any way, and this is a shame. I would like to have seen him play the opera singer, and Turturro the phlegmatic Gypsy outsider. </p> <p>But like Suzie's father, Cesar can show his feelings: hence that slightly curious title, which may, I fear, put a bit of a downer on the box-office. (It's actually more about the vivid emotions of women.) But this film shows that Sally Potter has a rough-and-ready talent for storytelling, which you wouldn't quite guess from The Tango Lesson or Orlando. And it has felicitous touches: such as Alan David's lovely cameo performance as the Welsh schoolmaster who tries to teach the young Suzie to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The idea of a film by Sally Potter is sometimes enough to make the heart sink: like a form of macrobiotic diet or all-over-body seaweed wrap, undertaken in the gloomy expectation of it being somehow good for you. But actually this movie is an engaging drama - improbable sometimes, yes, and occasionally absurd. But it has stylish and elegant performances from Cate Blanchett and John Turturro and is handsomely photographed by Sacha Vierney in colour tones at once rich and sepia-like. Christina Ricci plays a young Jewish girl in late 1920s Russia who is separated from her beloved father after being burned out of their village. She ends up in Paris as a dancer with a new Anglicised name, \"Suzie\", just in time for the Nazi occupation. There she meets Lola (Cate Blanchett) an angular, statuesque Russian, who becomes Suzie's pouting, giggling confidante. Blanchett suggests a Sally Bowles-like figure who yearns for a rich man - and finds one in the form of John Turturro's Dante, a petulant Italian opera singer who collaborates enthusiastically with the Nazis. Both Blanchett and Turturro carry off the roles with entertaining brio - and Blanchett especially has a gloriously expressive face on camera. But we are clearly given to understand that their campy bohemian loquaciousness is a sign of being lesser moral entities than Ricci, with her wise and moon-faced silences. Which brings us to the man she is in love with: Johnny Depp as Cesar, the smoulderingly dishy Gypsy musician with some sexy but carefully placed scars, who conducts her to his Gypsy encampment for the mandatory scene in which his family welcome her instinctively for a sing-song. Depp looks silly and self-conscious and just doesn't cut the mustard in any way, and this is a shame. I would like to have seen him play the opera singer, and Turturro the phlegmatic Gypsy outsider. But like Suzie's father, Cesar can show his feelings: hence that slightly curious title, which may, I fear, put a bit of a downer on the box-office. (It's actually more about the vivid emotions of women.) But this film shows that Sally Potter has a rough-and-ready talent for storytelling, which you wouldn't quite guess from The Tango Lesson or Orlando. And it has felicitous touches: such as Alan David's lovely cameo performance as the Welsh schoolmaster who tries to teach the young Suzie to sing All Things Bright and Beautiful.",

      "body": "<p>After the calamity that was Chris Menges's The Lost Son, Daniel Auteuil has returned to Swinging London to make another film in English. He is Pierre, a slightly wizened fortysomething French intellectual who has succumbed to the male equivalent of a menopausal hot flash. In a Reggie Perrin-like revelatory moment, Pierre has seen the rat-race rut he is in, so he chucks in his job in France lecturing in literature, bids au revoir to his wife and son and gets on the first plane to London, where he is kipping down in a horrific Bayswater hotel, hoping to write a novel. </p> <p>He is in a terrible state or, as the French say, a mauvaise passe - the film's original title. But director Michel Blanc and his collaborator Hanif Kureishi devise for him an unlikely salvation: beaten up by a Soho clip-joint bouncer one night, Pierre is patched up by Tom (Stuart Townsend), an unfeasibly handsome and kindly coffee bar manager, who introduces Pierre to his own lucrative sideline - being a male escort. Pierre is an instant success in this dubious trade; he sees in it heaven-sent material for his novel, and in this metropolitan excitement he sees a thrilling access to the reality denied him as a bourgeois husband and father. But his writing falters and Pierre wonders if his vocation is not the novel but simply high-class prostitution. </p> <p>It sounds like the material for comedy, and sometimes that is precisely what it is, intentionally or otherwise. But with Kureishi supplying the inspiration for the daring-yet-bohemian swinging sex scenes and Daniel Auteuil in the leading role, a very cool, dangerous urban movie is clearly what it is supposed to be. The craggily charismatic Franglais gigolo or beau de jour is turning the tables on gender expectations of what prostitution is. </p> <p>The problem is that, in English, Auteuil is a seal out of water. In French, he has a quicksilver eloquence when this is called upon; and when it is not, his silences are haughty, elegant, patrician. But forced into English, he barks his shins on our Anglo-Saxon syllables, and sounds absurd. Many a time he shouts his defiance or passion in English and it sounds something like: \"Ah doo nuert cay-arrr weurt yoo seenk eurve me, bee-coze ah eurm ern OAR!\" </p> <p>This is a shame, because otherwise Daniel Auteuil is almost Bogart-like in his fierce air of seclusion, his grizzled manner of having seen the world, combined with an openness to romantic persuasion. </p> <p>What is interesting about Michel Blanc's movie is that much of it works perfectly well. There is something dashing and fast in his swift cutting between scenes, from encounter to encounter, and sometimes from city to city. The resulting affectless impression of speed and detachment nicely complements the tone of irony in this urban tale, and the comic nightmare of Auteuil's character having to show his penis in advance to various clients. And the British cast Blanc assembles is really quite striking in its classy range of big and biggish names from TV and movies: Amanda Ryan, Frances Barber, Keith Allen, Barbara Flynn, Anastasia Hille. Noah Taylor has about one line as an obnoxious rich drunk at a party at which Pierre is \"working\": was his contribution supposed to be that subliminal? Or was most of his stuff cut? </p> <p>Anyway, this cameo-pageant is crowned by the furious Peter Mullan, who plays the husband of Claire Skinner, whom Pierre cynically tells he loves to secure her long-term custom as a \"regular\". Mullan growls something about how Pierre's fee is equivalent to a month of his wages and lays him out with a sucker punch. It is a nice performance from Skinner, though she is a little too county-set for the pairing to be anything other than implausible. It is unfortunate that Liza Walker's role, as the tart-with-a-heart who falls for Pierre, is the most slackly and unconvincingly written. </p> <p>Ultimately, the film describes what is a kind of would-be 21st-century Hogarthian progress as Pierre becomes more and more reliant on the white powder that he had been warned by the wise and almost fatherly Tom never to use except to loosen up a client. He is heading for another mauvaise passe and the movie appears to conclude by suggesting that once you're on the game, there's no way out. At least we are spared any student-ish cant about us all being prostitutes. </p> <p>Auteuil's undoubted charisma carries it off - just about. But, in the end, The Escort feels like a swanky artistic fantasy of what is actually involved in prostitution; the movie strains for the secret banal horror of the hotel-room transaction, and for an ironic and sophisticated take on the \"scene\" surrounding it, yet opts for a moralistic assumption of a bad end for Pierre if he remains on the game - while moreover remaining unaware of what the real effects are of a long-term career in \"escort\" work. Is it different for boys? Or not? Nothing in the script, or Auteuil's perky, craggy face can really tell us.</p>",

These are some of the questions they must address as they face their last chance to get it right. </p> <p><strong> Why is the rebuilding going to cost so much?</strong> </p> <p>The original cost of rebuilding Wembley was said to be \u00a3240m. Earlier this year the figure had soared to \u00a3660m, or more than twice that of comparable projects in Cardiff (\u00a3180m for the Millennium stadium), Paris (\u00a3260m for the Stade de France) and Sydney (\u00a3300m for Stadium Australia). No satisfactory explanation has been provided for the extra funding.

None of the representatives of the bodies associated with the project, notably the relevant members of the government and the FA, will go on the record with a frank assessment of its current standing. Instead the debate is being conducted by means of leaks and innuendos. If this is to be a \"national stadium\", as its title proclaims, the nation should be entitled to a degree of honesty and transparency in its efforts to understand what is being done in its name. </p> <p><strong> Who decided that the stadium would be incomplete without a new luxury hotel?</strong> </p> <p>When Wembley National Stadium Ltd came to the decision to build a hotel within the new structure, the board must have known that the Hilton hotel group already owned the sole rights to operate such a facility within the stadium precincts and that it had shown no desire to abandon the high-rise building in which it has operated the Wembley Hilton for more than 20 years. </p> <p><strong> Why should a sports stadium double as an office block?</strong> </p> <p>The chairman of WNSL should reveal the evidence that persuaded him, when the basic components of the new design were being assembled, of the existence of willing takers for 100,000 square feet of office space (enough for 1,000 workers) in a part of north-west London hardly noted for top-end commercial activity. </p> <p><strong> Why will one seat in six cost \u00a32,000 a year?</strong> </p> <p>About 14,000 of the stadium's projected 90,000 seats will be given to corporate guests and fans prepared to pay \u00a32,000 a season. While it could be argued that this proportion might be acceptable for a Premier League club, which has to make a profit in order to pay the constantly rising wages of its playing staff, it is surely excessive in the case of a stadium dedicated to the game's national showpieces. </p> <p><strong> Who sent out 2,000 invitations to cocktails?</strong> </p> <p>The specification of the new stadium refers to \"lavish\" banqueting and conference facilities, including a restaurant seating 2,000 people - one of nine restaurants on the premises. Yet this will be adjacent to the existing Wembley Conference Centre, still operated by the stadium's previous owners. It seems unlikely that the market will suddenly expand to a degree that would provide enough clients to make both enterprises profitable. </p> <p><strong> What would happen if the hotel, the office space, and the banqueting and conference facilities were taken out of the plans, in conjunction with a reduction in the seats allocated to corporate hospitality?</strong> </p> <p>The Wembley board should explain whether these facilities were incorporated in the specification in order to help pay for the cost and upkeep of the stadium, or whether their inclusion determined the cost. They should look again at the cost of running the stadium without them. </p> <p><strong> Since the FA is using the phrase \"national stadium\", isn't that what it should be?</strong> </p> <p>The FA should re-evaluate the idea of creating a proper multisports facility by including a running track, which would enable the sta dium to form the centrepiece of a future bid for the Olympic Games. Modern techniques of design and construction could then be employed to ensure that for football matches there would be seating close to the pitch. The 1948 Olympics formed an important part of the old stadium's heritage, and if track-and-field facilities are not incorporated in the new one it seems unlikely that London will ever again be in a position to host the games, or anything like them. </p> <p><strong> Why should a single sport own the national stadium?</strong> </p> <p>At the moment, the FA is the sole owner and operator of Wembley. But the current descent towards a potential debacle suggests that the public interest might be better served by some form of private-public partnership. The government, having failed to turn the Millennium Dome into a permanent monument to truth, beauty and the spirit of contemporary Britain, ought to recognise a chance to make amends by saving the football authorities from the consequences of their own hubris. </p> <p><strong> Speaking of hubris, should Ken Bates be told to step down?</strong> In its present incarnation the Wembley scheme will always look uncomfortably like Chelsea Village Mk2. Bates, after all, chairs both companies, and is seldom reluctant to impose his vision on projects with which he is associated. In recent days his contribution has been the subject of criticism both from within the FA and from merchant banks approached for funding, while architects and construction companies have also expressed reservations about the general conduct of the project.

      "body": "<p>Credit cards are a form of loan and provide one of the easiest ways of borrowing over a short period. You can use them in the UK or overseas to buy goods and withdraw cash that you pay for in full or in part at the end of the month.</p> <p>Card issuers will stipulate a minimum monthly payment of around \u00a35 or 5% of the outstanding balance on your card. But you can clear the whole balance if you have the resources. Most cards provide an upper spending limit. To begin with, this spending limit may be around \u00a31000, but card issuers will increase it if you prove to be a reliable customer.</p> <p>In the past, most cards charged the user an annual fee of between \u00a310 and \u00a315. Some still do, but with the invasion of credit card providers from the United States, card issuers are climbing over one another to offer the most attractive deal and annual fees are becoming less of a norm. The interest rate charged is also plummeting, with some card issuers offering 0% introductory rates on balance transfers for the first six months.</p> <p>As such, borrowing on credit cards is becoming cheaper, but only if you have the resources and discipline to pay off the balance each month. Because they are so easy to use, it is tempting to spend, spend, spend on a credit card and not be able to meet the balance at the end of the month. The less you pay off, the more interest you are charged and, month by month, this interest will be compounded </p> <p>You'll want to get the lowest interest rate you can but this is not as straightforward as it sounds. Card issuers don't just charge different rates, they calculate interest from different times and have different rates for purchases and cash withdrawals, as well as having low introductory offers. Which one is best for you will depend very much on your individual circumstances. See 'The best one for you' for more information.</p> <p>Most credit cards have some form of insurance built into them. This usually covers things like damage to goods purchased with the cards or cancellation of a flight or holiday. However, this insurance usually has a myriad of conditions attached to it, so if you intend to rely on it, read the small print and make sure you understand the conditions.

Those boasting low interest rates and annual charges often charge interest from the date of the transaction which means you will pay interest on your purchases and withdrawals even if you clear your balance in full each month. Instead, look for a card which only charges interest from the statement dates. If you're certain you'll pay the balance each month, the interest rate is irrelevant, but if you think you might need to carry some of the balance forwards every not and then, get a card with a lower rate.

Cards with low introductory rates can save you money, but make sure it applies to balance transfers and that once the introductory period is over, it doesn't revert to an exorbitant rate. And try to get a card which starts charging interest from the your statement date or the date the bill is added to your account. Cards that charge from the day of the transaction are more expensive. </p> <p>Card issuers usually charge a higher rate of interest on cash withdrawals and some charge a fee for each transaction as well. Typical charges are 1.5% of the withdrawals value, subject to a \u00a31.50 minimum. If you use your card to get cash, look carefully at the rate of interest you're paying and think about transferring to a card with lower interest or no cash withdrawal charges.</p> <p>Similarly, if you use your credit card overseas, check what kind of charges the issuer levies. Using a credit card is one of the easiest ways of getting at your money when in a foreign country, but almost all card providers charge something for overseas transactions and these will add up if you travel a lot. Typical charges are 2.5% to 2.75% of the transaction's value. They also convert overseas currency at their in-house exchange rate, which might not be the best on the market.</p> <p><a href=\"http://moneyunlimited.moneyworld.co.uk/compare/creditcards\">Compare credit cards</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Credit cards are a form of loan and provide one of the easiest ways of borrowing over a short period. You can use them in the UK or overseas to buy goods and withdraw cash that you pay for in full or in part at the end of the month. Card issuers will stipulate a minimum monthly payment of around \u00a35 or 5% of the outstanding balance on your card. But you can clear the whole balance if you have the resources. Most cards provide an upper spending limit. To begin with, this spending limit may be around \u00a31000, but card issuers will increase it if you prove to be a reliable customer. In the past, most cards charged the user an annual fee of between \u00a310 and \u00a315. Some still do, but with the invasion of credit card providers from the United States, card issuers are climbing over one another to offer the most attractive deal and annual fees are becoming less of a norm. The interest rate charged is also plummeting, with some card issuers offering 0% introductory rates on balance transfers for the first six months. As such, borrowing on credit cards is becoming cheaper, but only if you have the resources and discipline to pay off the balance each month. Because they are so easy to use, it is tempting to spend, spend, spend on a credit card and not be able to meet the balance at the end of the month. The less you pay off, the more interest you are charged and, month by month, this interest will be compounded You'll want to get the lowest interest rate you can but this is not as straightforward as it sounds. Card issuers don't just charge different rates, they calculate interest from different times and have different rates for purchases and cash withdrawals, as well as having low introductory offers. Which one is best for you will depend very much on your individual circumstances. See 'The best one for you' for more information. Most credit cards have some form of insurance built into them.

Those properties subject to premium hikes will still be able to get mortgages - provided the insurance increase does not become prohibitively expensive for the buyer - because the mortgage lender will be assured of getting the property's value back if it is flooded and becomes un-sellable. </p> <p>Bernard Clarke from the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: \"It is more difficult to borrow on a property whose long-term value is not secure. But for us, insurance is the lynchpin. If the buyer can get insurance, they will get a mortgage.\"</p> <p>It is still too early to say how many homes will be denied insurance when they come to renew their premiums, or how many will see premium hikes. </p> <p>The ABI says it will have to wait until all the flooding has stopped and all the claims have been paid to get an accurate figure of how much premiums will need to increase by. </p> <p>At present, insurers are looking at a bill of between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m since the end of October: but this is likely to go up as the floods don't look like they are going anywhere soon.</p> <p>The government, whose responsibility it is to put up flood defences, is currently reviewing the situation. However, it is likely to be several years until adequate defences are in place.</p> <p>Buildings and contents insurance are the main areas of cover affected by the flooding, although car insurance could also go up in the risky areas.</p> <p>The Environment Agency says over 50% of people living in flood risk areas are still not aware that their property may be in danger. In a bid to rectify the situation it has published a new flood risk map on its <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">website</a>. Users key in their postcode and the map shows if and how your property is at risk from floods.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk\">Environment agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/modules/MOD44.2856.html\">Flood maps online</a><br><a href=\"http://www.meto.govt.uk/\">The met office</a></p>",

With yet more flooding, this time hitting Devon, Cornwall and Herefordshire, insurers have admitted that if adequate flood defences are not built by the government, at-risk homes will have to pay more for their insurance or go without. Malcolm Tarling, a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers (ABI) today said: \"Insurance is about protecting yourself from the uncertain, but it now seems certain that some homes will be flooded again.\" Without insurance it will be impossible to get a mortgage, so some people are now sitting in houses which are effectively worthless because they couldn't sell them even if they wanted to. Those properties subject to premium hikes will still be able to get mortgages - provided the insurance increase does not become prohibitively expensive for the buyer - because the mortgage lender will be assured of getting the property's value back if it is flooded and becomes un-sellable. Bernard Clarke from the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: \"It is more difficult to borrow on a property whose long-term value is not secure. But for us, insurance is the lynchpin. If the buyer can get insurance, they will get a mortgage.\" It is still too early to say how many homes will be denied insurance when they come to renew their premiums, or how many will see premium hikes. The ABI says it will have to wait until all the flooding has stopped and all the claims have been paid to get an accurate figure of how much premiums will need to increase by. At present, insurers are looking at a bill of between \u00a3400m and \u00a3500m since the end of October: but this is likely to go up as the floods don't look like they are going anywhere soon. The government, whose responsibility it is to put up flood defences, is currently reviewing the situation. However, it is likely to be several years until adequate defences are in place. Buildings and contents insurance are the main areas of cover affected by the flooding, although car insurance could also go up in the risky areas. The Environment Agency says over 50% of people living in flood risk areas are still not aware that their property may be in danger. In a bid to rectify the situation it has published a new flood risk map on its website. Users key in their postcode and the map shows if and how your property is at risk from floods.

      "body": "<p><strong>What are they?</strong></p> <p>Taking out a personal loan is a way of borrowing money from a bank, building society or other financial service provider. You can usually borrow up to \u00a315,000 for a period that can range from six months to 10 years. Generally speaking, the more you borrow, the lower the interest, but rates vary from around 8% to 20%, so you'll need to shop around. This is made more difficult by the fact that it is not easy to compare personal loan rates because different lenders calculate the total cost of the loan (known as the APR or annual percentage rate) in different ways. </p> <p>Loans can be secured or unsecured. Secured loans are usually tied to your house - which means if you default, you may need to sell your house to repay the loan. Unsecured loans are not tied into anything, but if you don't make the repayments, the bank will blacklist you and you may find it difficult to take out other financial products, such as credit cards or a mortgage. Loans for specific items such as new cars are also available, often with lower interest rates. If you're taking out a loan for a car, tell your lender.</p> <p>Most loans are re-paid by monthly instalments and the repayment period will be agreed before you get the money. This is usually a fixed period and you will have to pay a redemption penalty - an example being two months interest - if you want to pay it off sooner. The longer the repayment period, the more interest you will be paying, so go for the shortest one you can manage. Flexible loans, which let you borrow and pay back at will, are becoming more common, but the interest rate charged is often significantly higher.</p> <p><strong>Why take one out?</strong></p> <p>Most people take out loans because they need money for things like school fees, new cars and home renovations. Others want to consolidate existing debts and pay a lower interest rate. </p> <p>Whatever the reason, people take them out because they need a cash lump sum that they can pay back over a period of months or years. </p> <p>If you're looking for emergency cash to tide you over, overdrafts or credit card borrowing will probably end up cheaper because you are not tied in to the loan's repayment period. </p> <p> <strong>The right one for me</strong></p> <p>First decide how much you want to borrow and for how long. Almost all lenders provide loans for up to five years, but if you want a longer repayment period you may find your choice more limited. The longest loans tend to be secured ones.</p> <p>Next you should get a range of quotes. Check if the quoted is stand-alone or if it includes things like loan insurance - then pick the cheapest rate. If there's a chance you'll be able to repay the loan early and save on the interest, look for a loan without any early redemption penalties.</p> <p>Lenders will push hard for you to take out the insurance, so think carefully about whether you need it or not. If you're in any doubt about being able to meet the repayments, insurance will put your mind at rest. Unfortunately it will also make the loan more expensive. A good alternative to loan insurance is accident, sickness and unemployment insurance. This will protect your overall income, including the loan, if you can't work.</p> <p>And finally: before signing on the dotted line, double-check the terms and conditions. Are you clear about what the monthly repayments will be? Are you aware of any restrictions and penalties?</p> <p><strong>Repayment problems</strong></p> <p>If you find you can't meet the repayments, contact your lender straightaway. Banks and building societies are usually willing to help and might freeze the loan for a while or extend the repayment period. Obviously, their ultimate aim is to get their money back, so if the loan is secured on your house or another asset, you may have to sell up to pay back the loan. In a worst case scenario, the lender could sue to recover the debt and, if it wins, force you to sell something like your house to pay back the loan. </p> <p> Compare loan rates with <a href=\"http://moneyunlimited.moneyworld.co.uk/compare/personal\" loans>moneyextra</a>.</p>",
