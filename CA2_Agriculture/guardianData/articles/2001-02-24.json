      "body": "<p>Normally there is nothing on earth that would make a sane British male put on cowboy boots and a 10-gallon hat. But you've only got to arrive at a dude ranch to realise that, frankly, in anything else you would look completely stupid. So the first thing I had to do when we arrived at the Laramie River Ranch in northern Colorado was to pick out a nifty pair of grey boots plus a huge broad-brimmed hat. Of course I looked idiotic, but - and this is the important thing, - I looked idiotic in a wholly appropriate sort of way. </p> <p>A dude ranch is basically a resort, Club Med with horses. We'd gone there because two families told us they'd had the best holidays of their lives at dude ranches, and having tried it we understand why. You don't just ride, although there's probably not a whole lot of point in going if you can't stand the sight or smell of horses. But there are plenty of other things to do, such as hiking, fishing, roping, camping, singing, square dancing, volleyball, bird and wildlife-spotting, river-riding on tubes, toasting marshmallows round the old campfire, and eating. </p> <p>In fact there is a lot of eating. The ranches vie with each other to provide delicious food in vast, unnerving, American quantities - huge steaks, mountains of fried chicken, barbecued ribs stacked like the struts of a suspension bridge, and breakfasts so immense that you totter from the table wondering how you'll reach the door, never mind climb up into your saddle. Usually everything you eat is included in the price, so at most ranches you don't need to put your hand in your pocket from the moment you arrive till the day you leave. However it's a good idea to bring your own booze, especially as several states, including Colorado, don't sell alcohol in shops on a Sunday. And we were 50 minutes' drive from the nearest liquor store. </p> <p>The first of the two ranches we visited was King Mountain, two hours north-west of Denver. It's a vast resort ranch with tennis courts, a swimming pool, bowling alley, and an airstrip if you choose to arrive by plane. This is Indian territory, literally, since the ranch - at one time a combined fishing lodge and bordello - was bought in 1993 by Baljit Nanda, an Indian from the sub-continent rather than the reservation, who had studied at business school and started making his fortune when he bought a bankrupt mushroom farm. </p> <p>As with almost all dude ranches, King Mountain focuses on riding. While we were there Frank Bell, a real-life horse whisperer and very much like the one played by Robert Redford, paid us a visit. \"The guy in the book and the movie wasn't based on me,\" Frank said, \"but he sure as hell was good for business.\" </p> <p>Unlike traditional horse training, which starts from the notion that they are wild creatures who need obedience battered into them, horse whispering involves kindness. Horses are prey animals (they have set-apart eyes which can see nearly 360 degrees; we hunters have two eyes together so we can judge distances in stereo.) For a prey animal the worst thing in the world is to have something jump on your back, so you soothe them by stroking and caressing and patting the parts where they can't easily get rid of flies. </p> <p>That evening, after a dinner that involved cooking our own fabulous tender steaks on the barbecue, we assembled in the bar for drinks and chat and games. One of the pleasures of dude ranching is instant, spray-on friendship. You meet people you will probably never encounter again in your life, but the experiences of the day give you so much in common that they temporarily become your oldest and dearest friends. And, of course, Americans are warm and courteous in a way we British seem to have forgotten. </p> <p>After two days we drove over the high, rain-sodden plains of Colorado to the Laramie River Ranch. The river, named after a French trapper, Jacques la Ramie, murdered by American Indians, runs through the property. The ranch was smaller and simpler than King Mountain, which gave it a cosy intimacy. By the end of the first day, we knew all the staff, including the owners, Bill and Krista Burleigh, and the wranglers, young men and women who look after the horses and take you riding. </p> <p>You are given your own horse for the week. Mine was called Murdoch, who made a habit of taking good, nutritious material in at one end, and expelled it in the form of noisome gas from the other. After one long ride, my 11-year old son, who had been downwind of Murdoch, announced that the poor beast had farted 17 times. </p> <p>The views were sensational. One glorious morning we had climbed up Crazy Mountain, just outside the ranch, and looked through the clear, sage-scented air down into the valley, saw the lines of willow following the course of the river, the herds of buffalo grazing on the slopes, and reflected that apart from the dirt tracks, the view must have looked almost as it did when the first native Americans arrived from across the Alaska landbridge. </p> <p>Dude ranches are a long tradition in the US. Originally people from the crowded industrial east would come by train to join friends and family in the west. Then as now there was an element of fantasy, of an Elysian retreat from the corrupt city to the unspoiled land. For years tradition dictated that the hospitality was free, but as economic problems grew in the West, commerce crept in. In 1882 Bert Rumbold of Buffalo, New York, signed the guest register in a North Dakota ranch, and agreed to pay $10 for a week's room, board and use of horse. Of course, prices are rather higher now. </p> <p>We had a fabulous time. There were trail rides out to glorious picnic spots, where we ate buffalo burgers and watched the coyote and mountain sheep. One night we went to a campsite, high in the mountains, where Bill grilled steaks and we drank cold beers as dusk fell. We watched the lights of Laramie, Wyoming, shine miles away in the valley. </p> <p>There really are cowboys, too, because the Japanese have yet to invent a machine for transferring large numbers of cattle from one place to another. One lunchtime we were riding back to the ranch, when a herd went thundering past us. Cowboys may still whoop it up on Saturday nights, but most of them these days are solid family men - and women. But they still dress in the same old way, except with designer sunglasses. One guy with five-day stubble, a black hat, a red spotted bandana, leather chaps and a bullwhip went pounding past us. Just as he reached my wife, he turned round, smiled, and said \"Boo!\" </p> <p>It's a great trip for kids, too. Ours had lessons in ice cream making, tie-dying T-shirts, volleyball, square dancing, nature walks, and they roasted marshmallows at the camp fire. They came for late-night walks and watched the brilliantly vivid night sky, and they played games in the lodge. (Our kids insisted on being able to use English spelling at Scrabble. At one point I heard an American voice rumble: \"I never done heard of that word spelled that way before...\") </p> <p>It's worth shopping around for your ideal ranch. We popped over for a fact-finding visit to the neighbouring Raweh ranch, run by a couple from New York, who turned every evening into a boisterous cocktail party. They had several British families there, some of whom come every year. They also had a cowboy poet to entertain us. That sounds embarrassing but it's not; in fact, it is a recognised art form these days, largely because long days on the trail give the composers lots of time to polish each poem to perfection. </p> <p>The trick is probably to find your ranch on the internet, balancing price and setting, and facilities. If something isn't mentioned, it won't be there, so decide if you must have tennis courts or a pool. Some specialise in children, and will make that clear. Others - like the Old Glendovey Lodge, which we visited, and which is mainly for hunters - rarely have any. </p> <p>Whatever happens, you're unlikely to be disappointed. It's an exhilarating, exuberant holiday, and our lot can't wait to go again.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0845 7733377 <a href=\"http://www.british-airways.com\">www.british-airways.com</a>) flies from Gatwick to Denver.

Next week looks good for Soll (***), Obergurgl (****) and Mayrhofen (***). France For the best snow head to Montgenevre (****) and Serre Chevalier (****). Switzerland A small amount of new snow has fallen inDavos (****) and Klosters (****). The pistes of Zermatt (****) and St Moritz (****) are still very good. Italy Despite a couple of weeks with very little new snow, the pistes in Madonna di Campiglio (***) are still good with perfect ski and board conditions, low temperatures and bright sunshine. Cervinia (****) also has excellent on piste conditions. Andorra More snow will be needed soon on the lower slopes of Soldeu (***) and Pas de la Casa (***) although the upper slopes are still in good condition. North America Resorts such as Mammoth (****) and Squaw Valley (****) have had up to 40cm of new snow. Utah has also received some new snow, and Solitude (****) has had over 25cm of new snow in the past few days. In Canada, there has been some more snow in Fernie (****), Whistler (****) and the Banff Ski Area (***). Liz Russell, The Ski Club of Great Britain \u0095 Key to conditions: No snowflakes = a serious lack of snow - no lifts open. * = poor snow conditions, very few lifts open. ** = conditions reasonable, some slopes in poor condition.*** = plenty of good skiing.**** = good conditions.***** = fantastic on and off piste.

      "body": "<p>Blame the vodka martinis. In Britain, I would have been getting ready for my mid-morning coffee. In New York, cocktail capital of the world, it was 5am and I was belting out \"maybe it's because I'm a Londoner\" in Central Park to the bemusement of early morning joggers. </p> <p>At that point, I was on a search for pizza with an almost holy grail-like fervour. Then the rain started and the fervour died down, so instead of a crusty dough-based snack, I tottered towards the Upper West side, and ducked into a caf\u00e9 to devour eggs benedict instead. At 6am, I tumbled into my hotel bed on 8th Avenue. </p> <p>The Big Apple's a night-time town all right, but it has a lot more to offer than just food and drink. Sun down doesn't mean slow down. Bowling at 3am? Jazz at 4am? Work out at 5am? No problem. The consumer is king and, as long as you have a credit card handy, you can keep going right through till morning. </p> <p>For the jet-lagged insomniac, here are a few suggestions of what to do in Manhattan once the last bar has chucked you out and the land of nod seems further away than the night bus to Camberwell. Just remember - vodka martinis: not big, not clever. </p> <p><strong> Bowling</strong></p> <p>3am. I'm ten-pin bowling to the sound of Tom Jones. The warbling Welshman comes care of a live DJ tucked just behind me. For the first time in my life I'm destroying the pins like a god. Yeah Tom, I am indeed a sex bomb. More beer equals more strikes, and luckily a trendy art-deco bar is just a stagger away from the lanes. Come all the way to New York and stay up this late to go bowling? Most definitely, if it's the Monday \"lights out disco night\" at Bowlmor Lanes in the East Village, open since 1938, but spruced up two years ago at a cost of $2m. For $17 you can bop and bowl between 10pm and 4am while DJ Ray spins everything from Grease to Britpop. There's a young, hip mixed crowd of club workers (for many, Monday's their night off) plus locals, students and a regular intake of models and celebs - we'd just missed Matt Damon apparently. The bowling ball and pins really do glow in the dark. </p> <p>110 University Place, between 12th and 13th Streets tel 212-255 8188, <a href=\"http://www.bowlmor.com\">www.bowlmor.com</a>. <strong> Fitness</strong> </p> <p>The great thing about a gym that's open 24 hours is that there are very few people around to see your bottom wobbling all over the step machine in the dead of night. In fact, when I was at Crunch (404 Lafayette St, tel 212-614 0120, <a href=\"http://www.crunch.com\">www.crunch.com</a>) there was no one else around. The price of $22 will allow you to use the state-of-the-art equipment. The cycle machines have a built-in web surfer, so not only can you check out the dot.coms but also e-mail your mates back home. Alternatively, why not go jogging? If the urge does grab you, you'll find fellow enthusiasts running round Central Park in the pitch black as early as 5am. For those who prefer to go in a group, a dawn fitness session at 6.30am is offered by New York Sports Club - call 212-860 8630 for details, or visit <a href=\"http://www.nysc.com.\">www.nysc.com </a> </p> <p><strong> Food</strong></p> <p>Many restaurants are open late, but not many are open throughout the night. Florent in the Meatpacking district (trendy gentrification and designer chi-chi in one direction, run down, graffitied and rather grim in the other) is open 24 hours at the weekend and till 5am Mondays to Thursdays. Its night-time menu has staples such as eggs, bacon, toast and fries for around $5. Or, to clear the post-club hangover go for snails in garlic butter ($5.95), or duck mousse with port wine ($5.50). You'll find it at 69 Gansevoort Street, between Greenwich and Washington Streets (tel 212-989 5779). </p> <p>For a true \"Mom Pop and apple pie\" diner, the Cheyenne at 33rd St and 9th Avenue (212-465 8750) is open around the clock. It's \"Happy Days\" minus Ralph and Potsie. As well as the usual breakfast fare, there are bagels with cream cheese and lox (sliced smoked salmon) for $8.25, or a half-pound bison burger and fries for $4.95. Service is quick and ever smiling.</p> <p>If you really can't do without a kebab, go to the 24-hour Bereket on 187 East Houston Street at Orchard (212-475-7700). </p> <p><strong> Jazz</strong></p> <p>The aptly named Smalls in Greenwich Village (183 West 10th Street at 7th Avenue, tel 212-929 7565, <a href=\"http://www.smallsjazz.com\">www.smallsjazz.com</a>) is an intimate basement joint, which opens at 10pm and only calls it a night the next morning at 8am. It's not full of big name stars, just people who love playing jazz and those who love to listen. Very cool. There's a cover charge of $10. No booze so bring your own, although they do serve juices and tea. A silently appreciative crowd of 15 people soaked up the 4am atmosphere when I was there on a Tuesday morning. </p> <p><strong> Night-time views</strong></p> <p>The last elevator goes up to the 86th floor observatory on the Empire State Building at 11.30pm, ($9 for adults), although it'll be a quick gawp as you have to be out by midnight.

You can celebrate your return to earth with a drink in the bar at street level. </p> <p>For a classic picture-postcard view over the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan, spend $1.50 to take subway line 2 or 3 to Brooklyn Heights and head for Pierrepoint and Montague Streets. When night falls and the lights in the financial district come on, it's spectacular. If you are hungry, come back in a cab over either the Brooklyn or Manhattan bridges and make for either Chinatown or Little Italy. </p> <p>For a bargain harbour cruise with great views thrown in, catch the Staten Island ferry from South Ferry Plaza at Battery Park (call 717-815 BOAT) - it runs hourly throughout the night and (are you reading this, Mr Livingstone?) it's free. </p> <p><strong> Ask a local</strong></p> <p>Stuck for ideas? Then let's face it, no one knows Noo York like a Noo Yorker. From $60 a hour plus service and transport (double at night) Beth Stone and Jan Hutkoff will guide your group eclectically and entertainingly round their home town, to your specifications or theirs. \"Okay, let's go to Chinatown for tea, then look at the late JFK Jnr's apartment, check out that tattoo parlour on Canal Street, and I know a great Turkish restaurant,\" recommended Beth. You can go by Seinfeld's soup-nazi hangout, Fulton Street fish market, late night delis, the outer boroughs - anything, just name it. Call Signature Tours (212-517 4306). </p> <p><strong> Pool</strong></p> <p>The \u00fcber-hip go to Chelsea Bar and Billiards at 54 West 21st Street (between 5th and 6th Avenues, tel 212-989 0096.) to get their pool fix. A classic, grungy, smoke-filled dive? Don't think so, sweetie. Newly renovated at a cost of $1.5m, it's open every night till 4am. As well as showing off your skills on the table, you can sip a vodka-tonic in a triangular glass (triangle - pool, get it?) and nibble on crab cakes or prawns with mango cocktail sauce (both $12). To hire a table for an hour costs $12. </p> <p><strong> Night court</strong></p> <p>I was told by a local that the public gallery of the Night Court (open Wednesday, Thursday, Friday all night, on other days till 1am) is a place where teenagers go for a cheap date. When I was there, necking teens from Queens seemed thin on the ground. \"I just don't feel right, wallowing in other people's misery,\" said a friend. I agreed - for about a second. (It's not my fault. We're all Jerry Springer's children now.) Pushing open the doors to courtroom 130 and taking up my place on the tatty benches, it was like a downmarket Ally McBeal set. The judge looked bored, the lawyers had cheap suits and bad hair and the cops seemed to have scoffed the regulation amount of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. A man accused of assault appeared for five minutes before being led back to the cells, just visible through a back door. After half an hour of not an awful lot else, we left. \"Come back on Sunday, it's busier,\" said the policeman manning the security scanner.

      "bodyText": "Blame the vodka martinis. In Britain, I would have been getting ready for my mid-morning coffee. In New York, cocktail capital of the world, it was 5am and I was belting out \"maybe it's because I'm a Londoner\" in Central Park to the bemusement of early morning joggers. At that point, I was on a search for pizza with an almost holy grail-like fervour. Then the rain started and the fervour died down, so instead of a crusty dough-based snack, I tottered towards the Upper West side, and ducked into a caf\u00e9 to devour eggs benedict instead. At 6am, I tumbled into my hotel bed on 8th Avenue. The Big Apple's a night-time town all right, but it has a lot more to offer than just food and drink. Sun down doesn't mean slow down. Bowling at 3am? Jazz at 4am? Work out at 5am? No problem. The consumer is king and, as long as you have a credit card handy, you can keep going right through till morning. For the jet-lagged insomniac, here are a few suggestions of what to do in Manhattan once the last bar has chucked you out and the land of nod seems further away than the night bus to Camberwell. Just remember - vodka martinis: not big, not clever. Bowling 3am. I'm ten-pin bowling to the sound of Tom Jones. The warbling Welshman comes care of a live DJ tucked just behind me. For the first time in my life I'm destroying the pins like a god. Yeah Tom, I am indeed a sex bomb. More beer equals more strikes, and luckily a trendy art-deco bar is just a stagger away from the lanes. Come all the way to New York and stay up this late to go bowling? Most definitely, if it's the Monday \"lights out disco night\" at Bowlmor Lanes in the East Village, open since 1938, but spruced up two years ago at a cost of $2m. For $17 you can bop and bowl between 10pm and 4am while DJ Ray spins everything from Grease to Britpop. There's a young, hip mixed crowd of club workers (for many, Monday's their night off) plus locals, students and a regular intake of models and celebs - we'd just missed Matt Damon apparently. The bowling ball and pins really do glow in the dark. 110 University Place, between 12th and 13th Streets tel 212-255 8188, www.bowlmor.com. Fitness The great thing about a gym that's open 24 hours is that there are very few people around to see your bottom wobbling all over the step machine in the dead of night. In fact, when I was at Crunch (404 Lafayette St, tel 212-614 0120, www.crunch.com) there was no one else around. The price of $22 will allow you to use the state-of-the-art equipment. The cycle machines have a built-in web surfer, so not only can you check out the dot.coms but also e-mail your mates back home. Alternatively, why not go jogging? If the urge does grab you, you'll find fellow enthusiasts running round Central Park in the pitch black as early as 5am. For those who prefer to go in a group, a dawn fitness session at 6.30am is offered by New York Sports Club - call 212-860 8630 for details, or visit www.nysc.com Food Many restaurants are open late, but not many are open throughout the night.

The exclusion of a section on phrases is a shame as those who do not speak the local language will need to carry a phrase book, too. A traditional guidebook remains necessary if you want to discover the background of the places you are visiting, but CityMap Guides are a useful field tool.",

      "body": "<p>'To my kids it's the Taj Mahal, Niagara Falls, Sherwood Forest and Davy Crockett all rolled into one.\" Although she forgot - how could she? - to include Mickey Mouse in her list, this was one American mother's view of Disneyland, the genesis of theme park culture, soon after it opened in the summer of 1955. </p> <p>Nearly 46 years later, the mouse's latest 3D fantasia, Disney's California Adventure, has opened in what used to be the parking lots alongside the veteran Disneyland. Here, California's major attractions have been shrunk and set cheek-by-jowl with one another. Got no time to tour the Golden Gate and the Napa Valley, or Hollywood? Well, head on down to Anaheim, Orange County, just 27 miles south of central Los Angeles and see it all for 43 bucks a day at this latest $1.4bn tourist magnet. </p> <p>If you're a theme park addict, the combination of Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure and the new Downtown Disney - an open-air shopping mall conjured from every style of local architecture - should prove to be addictive. If there's a difference between old and new, then Disneyland is more for children and Disney's California Adventure more for - I was going to say grown-ups, but that's not quite right - Americans and those enthralled by US culture who want to experience heart-in-mouth, brain-in-trainers fun-fair rides and a touch of California without the hassle of freeway tailbacks and the dangers, real or imagined, of walking - as if - in downtown LA. </p> <p>If, though, like me, this is your very first theme park, then the wonderful world of Disney really is hard to come to terms with. I know it's essentially for kids and the child in all of us, and I know that one should suspend disbelief and relax, yet the whole experience is so darned controlling that anyone who hates passivity is in danger of going bonkers. Old and new theme parks and the new bit of ersatz downtown between them are so squeaky clean, so punctuated by loudspeakers, so patrolled by cheerleaders, so laced with long queues for rides, I wanted to believe that, like Dumbo, I could fly and disappear into the magnificent mountainscape that beckons north and west of Anaheim. </p> <p>Disney's is the kind of world that can turn a grown man to drink (which I did one night, unable to face spending a whole night alone in a room at the Disney Pier Hotel with a bedspread covered in Mickey Mouse ears; portraits of the Mouse and Goofy on the walls; Mickey Mouse soap, shampoo and body lotion in the bathroom; and the utterly surreal sight of the new theme park lit-up like a marshalling yard on acid outside the window). </p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I adore the schmaltzy sweetness of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, yet I can easily imagine why some of the top artists working on Disney's greatest feature back in 1936-7 turned to drawing pictures of Walt's flawless heroine in orgiastic embraces with Bashful, Sleepy, Grumpy and gang. It's easy, too, after a couple of days here, to sympathise with Disney scriptwriter Mike Myers, who was new to the studio's story department in the late 30s; here he is making his debut at a storyboard conference: \"Donald Duck leaps outta bed madder 'n a goddam harnit. He trips over a pair of shoes and falls on his ass, then the fuckin' duck jumps to his feet and runs out of the fuckin' door.\" A senior colleague, Dave Hand, stopped Myers: \"Walt won't stand for you referring to Donald as 'that fuckin' duck'!\" Nonplussed, Myers replied: \"Well, that's what he is, ain't he?\" </p> <p>That story comes from Steven Watts' meticulously researched The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life (1997). In taking a trip down Walt's memory lane, Watts shows us - as several authors, many more strident, have done - that this was no yellow brick road. Disney's childhood (born in Chicago, 1900; raised in Marceline, Missouri and then Kansas City) was less than idyllic. His father, Elias, a puritanical Congregationalist emerges as an over-zealous, anti-Semitic disciplinarian bully. What Walt sought to create in later life was the childhood he wished he had enjoyed, a childhood that Middle Americans from Anaheim to Albany, Buffalo to Baton Rouge wished they had enjoyed, too. </p> <p>Here's Uncle Walt giving a radio talk at the time of Snow White: \"In every one of us something remains of our childhood; in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot deep down in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget and that maybe our picture can help recall.\" Which leads us inexorably to Disneyland and its latest offspring. </p> <p>Main Street, Disneyland, was a scaled-down and loved-up recreation of Marceline, the hicksville town that Disney wanted to believe was more magical than it ever really was in the few years he lived there during his childhood. </p> <p>Straddling acre after acre of former orange groves, Disneyland is a hermetic world that has drawn admirers unashamedly high-brow and archly populist; in 1963, the chairman of a conference on urban planning at Harvard described the faux-town as \"the greatest piece of urban design in the US\". He had obviously forgotten Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and downtown Savannah, but who's arguing? </p> <p>The latest stage is gained through what looks like a giant postcard with letters, nearly 12ft tall, spelling out C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A. Step inside, folks, and here's a recreation, of sorts, of Hollywood Boulevard, of Fort Edwards Air Force base (from where Chuck Yeager was first to break the sound barrier in 1947) and Soarin' over California, a superb Imax ride that makes you feel, wind-in-the-hair and all, that you're flying over this beautiful state. </p> <p>This is state-of-the-mouse technology that makes everything at last year's dreary Millennium Experience look much less than the \u00a31bn it cost to make us angry. It's a cliche, I know, but whatever you think of the idea of Disney's themed world, boy, do they do the rides well. I thought I would hate being twisted and hurled down the rocky rapids of the Grizzly Bear Run, yet I loved this white-water rafting ride, and when it was over, and soaked to the skin, we did it all over again. </p> <p>I even got to like California Screamin', a whizz of a roller-coaster that shoves you off from rest faster than a Shelby Cobra and loops the loop, comically, around Mickey Mouse's ears. I liked the It's Tough to be a Bug animatronic-assisted 3D movie during which giant black-widow spiders fall from the ceiling, creepy crawlies seem to run under and over your seat and pretty cartoon bees and butterflies appear to be flapping and singing before you in mid-air. </p> <p>For those few minutes, I did find Disney enchanting; and for a few minutes more riding the Haunted House back over the way in Disneyland and, best - or worst - of all, the mind-numbing It's a Small World. On this ride, designed for the New York World's Fair of 1964-5 by the illustrator Mary Blair, you potter on boats very slowly through luridly coloured tableaux - blues, greens, yellows, hot pinks and oranges - saluting the world's children. These are odd little puppets that sing, over and over again, a potty song that could break the morale of the toughest terrorist under interrogation by security services. </p> <p>For a couple of hours, I allowed myself to swing, if not exactly wish, on Uncle Walt's star. I was much happier, though, playing stick and ball with my friend Emily's dogs through an LA park with the commercial towers of the city and the snow-capped ring of the San Rafael Mountains around us. Goofin' around with real dogs brings me, for one, a lot closer to the innocence of childhood than meeting actors dressed as Pluto or Goofy. Or beachcombing idly along the California shoreline, bare feet in the lapping water. Or taking a shining limousine for a tour of Universal Studios and dreaming of being the king or queen of Hollywood. </p> <p>Yet, no one can doubt that Disney and his successors know what they are doing. Sure, it's nuts to compress California into a few hundred acres of Orange County, but this daisy-chain of theme parks is an escape from reality, not a reflection of it. In any case, so much of the daily experience of the chintzier or more picturesque parts of the US have been planned, regulated, clipped and groomed into a perfect version of their former selves, it can be hard to tell theme park from reality. </p> <p>The theme parks of Anaheim are ultimately a fanfare for the common man, woman and, above all, child, in search of escape, however contrived, and in love with an impossible folkish dream of flying elephants, fairytale castles and wild frontiers. If, ultimately, they pall, perhaps it's just that we're not all-Americans... yet. </p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong></p> <p>The Disneyland Resort, Anaheim, Orange County, California, is located 27 miles south of downtown Los Angeles. Information: 001 714 781 4565 or <a href=\"http://www.disneyland.com\">www.disneyland.com</a> It comprises: Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure and Downtown Disney. </p> <p>From downtown LA or LAX airport, take I-5 (Golden State/Santa Ana Freeway) south and exit on Disneyland Drive.

      "bodyText": "'To my kids it's the Taj Mahal, Niagara Falls, Sherwood Forest and Davy Crockett all rolled into one.\" Although she forgot - how could she? - to include Mickey Mouse in her list, this was one American mother's view of Disneyland, the genesis of theme park culture, soon after it opened in the summer of 1955. Nearly 46 years later, the mouse's latest 3D fantasia, Disney's California Adventure, has opened in what used to be the parking lots alongside the veteran Disneyland. Here, California's major attractions have been shrunk and set cheek-by-jowl with one another. Got no time to tour the Golden Gate and the Napa Valley, or Hollywood? Well, head on down to Anaheim, Orange County, just 27 miles south of central Los Angeles and see it all for 43 bucks a day at this latest $1.4bn tourist magnet. If you're a theme park addict, the combination of Disneyland, Disney's California Adventure and the new Downtown Disney - an open-air shopping mall conjured from every style of local architecture - should prove to be addictive. If there's a difference between old and new, then Disneyland is more for children and Disney's California Adventure more for - I was going to say grown-ups, but that's not quite right - Americans and those enthralled by US culture who want to experience heart-in-mouth, brain-in-trainers fun-fair rides and a touch of California without the hassle of freeway tailbacks and the dangers, real or imagined, of walking - as if - in downtown LA. If, though, like me, this is your very first theme park, then the wonderful world of Disney really is hard to come to terms with. I know it's essentially for kids and the child in all of us, and I know that one should suspend disbelief and relax, yet the whole experience is so darned controlling that anyone who hates passivity is in danger of going bonkers. Old and new theme parks and the new bit of ersatz downtown between them are so squeaky clean, so punctuated by loudspeakers, so patrolled by cheerleaders, so laced with long queues for rides, I wanted to believe that, like Dumbo, I could fly and disappear into the magnificent mountainscape that beckons north and west of Anaheim. Disney's is the kind of world that can turn a grown man to drink (which I did one night, unable to face spending a whole night alone in a room at the Disney Pier Hotel with a bedspread covered in Mickey Mouse ears; portraits of the Mouse and Goofy on the walls; Mickey Mouse soap, shampoo and body lotion in the bathroom; and the utterly surreal sight of the new theme park lit-up like a marshalling yard on acid outside the window). Don't get me wrong. I adore the schmaltzy sweetness of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, yet I can easily imagine why some of the top artists working on Disney's greatest feature back in 1936-7 turned to drawing pictures of Walt's flawless heroine in orgiastic embraces with Bashful, Sleepy, Grumpy and gang. It's easy, too, after a couple of days here, to sympathise with Disney scriptwriter Mike Myers, who was new to the studio's story department in the late 30s; here he is making his debut at a storyboard conference: \"Donald Duck leaps outta bed madder 'n a goddam harnit. He trips over a pair of shoes and falls on his ass, then the fuckin' duck jumps to his feet and runs out of the fuckin' door.\" A senior colleague, Dave Hand, stopped Myers: \"Walt won't stand for you referring to Donald as 'that fuckin' duck'!\" Nonplussed, Myers replied: \"Well, that's what he is, ain't he?\" That story comes from Steven Watts' meticulously researched The Magic Kingdom: Walt Disney and the American Way of Life (1997). In taking a trip down Walt's memory lane, Watts shows us - as several authors, many more strident, have done - that this was no yellow brick road. Disney's childhood (born in Chicago, 1900; raised in Marceline, Missouri and then Kansas City) was less than idyllic. His father, Elias, a puritanical Congregationalist emerges as an over-zealous, anti-Semitic disciplinarian bully. What Walt sought to create in later life was the childhood he wished he had enjoyed, a childhood that Middle Americans from Anaheim to Albany, Buffalo to Baton Rouge wished they had enjoyed, too. Here's Uncle Walt giving a radio talk at the time of Snow White: \"In every one of us something remains of our childhood; in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot deep down in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget and that maybe our picture can help recall.\" Which leads us inexorably to Disneyland and its latest offspring. Main Street, Disneyland, was a scaled-down and loved-up recreation of Marceline, the hicksville town that Disney wanted to believe was more magical than it ever really was in the few years he lived there during his childhood. Straddling acre after acre of former orange groves, Disneyland is a hermetic world that has drawn admirers unashamedly high-brow and archly populist; in 1963, the chairman of a conference on urban planning at Harvard described the faux-town as \"the greatest piece of urban design in the US\". He had obviously forgotten Manhattan's Rockefeller Center and downtown Savannah, but who's arguing? The latest stage is gained through what looks like a giant postcard with letters, nearly 12ft tall, spelling out C-A-L-I-F-O-R-N-I-A. Step inside, folks, and here's a recreation, of sorts, of Hollywood Boulevard, of Fort Edwards Air Force base (from where Chuck Yeager was first to break the sound barrier in 1947) and Soarin' over California, a superb Imax ride that makes you feel, wind-in-the-hair and all, that you're flying over this beautiful state. This is state-of-the-mouse technology that makes everything at last year's dreary Millennium Experience look much less than the \u00a31bn it cost to make us angry. It's a cliche, I know, but whatever you think of the idea of Disney's themed world, boy, do they do the rides well. I thought I would hate being twisted and hurled down the rocky rapids of the Grizzly Bear Run, yet I loved this white-water rafting ride, and when it was over, and soaked to the skin, we did it all over again. I even got to like California Screamin', a whizz of a roller-coaster that shoves you off from rest faster than a Shelby Cobra and loops the loop, comically, around Mickey Mouse's ears. I liked the It's Tough to be a Bug animatronic-assisted 3D movie during which giant black-widow spiders fall from the ceiling, creepy crawlies seem to run under and over your seat and pretty cartoon bees and butterflies appear to be flapping and singing before you in mid-air. For those few minutes, I did find Disney enchanting; and for a few minutes more riding the Haunted House back over the way in Disneyland and, best - or worst - of all, the mind-numbing It's a Small World. On this ride, designed for the New York World's Fair of 1964-5 by the illustrator Mary Blair, you potter on boats very slowly through luridly coloured tableaux - blues, greens, yellows, hot pinks and oranges - saluting the world's children. These are odd little puppets that sing, over and over again, a potty song that could break the morale of the toughest terrorist under interrogation by security services. For a couple of hours, I allowed myself to swing, if not exactly wish, on Uncle Walt's star. I was much happier, though, playing stick and ball with my friend Emily's dogs through an LA park with the commercial towers of the city and the snow-capped ring of the San Rafael Mountains around us. Goofin' around with real dogs brings me, for one, a lot closer to the innocence of childhood than meeting actors dressed as Pluto or Goofy. Or beachcombing idly along the California shoreline, bare feet in the lapping water. Or taking a shining limousine for a tour of Universal Studios and dreaming of being the king or queen of Hollywood. Yet, no one can doubt that Disney and his successors know what they are doing. Sure, it's nuts to compress California into a few hundred acres of Orange County, but this daisy-chain of theme parks is an escape from reality, not a reflection of it. In any case, so much of the daily experience of the chintzier or more picturesque parts of the US have been planned, regulated, clipped and groomed into a perfect version of their former selves, it can be hard to tell theme park from reality. The theme parks of Anaheim are ultimately a fanfare for the common man, woman and, above all, child, in search of escape, however contrived, and in love with an impossible folkish dream of flying elephants, fairytale castles and wild frontiers. If, ultimately, they pall, perhaps it's just that we're not all-Americans... yet.

      "body": "<p>Miami has a buzz that touches you the moment you hit the runway. As you get into your hire car, it's practically impossible not to dispose of your jeans in favour of surf shorts, undo a few shirt buttons and reach for the shades. Flick on the stereo and the airwaves are packed with a vibrant mix of hip-hop, house and Cuban stations. </p> <p>With that in mind, Miami folk find it hard to fathom why anyone would turn their back on all this and head instead for the backwater of Key West, the most southern point in America, along one of the world's longest dead-end roads. But they do. In fact, more than a million people make the journey each year. One reason is the weather. While Miami has an enviable annual sun quota, the Keys have their own microclimate, which means that the gauge rarely dips below 21C or rises above 29C, and rain is uncommon. </p> <p>Another attraction is that along the 125-mile drive to the renowned party town of Key West, there is the opportunity to sample the aquatic delights of America's largest coral reef, namely the diving and snorkelling around Key Largo and what is continually trumpeted on local advertising hoardings as the capital of world big-game fishing, Islamorada. </p> <p>Highway One stretches in a straight line through the islands, from Homestead, just south of Miami, all the way to Key West and, with the speed limit set at around 50mph for almost the entire journey, the best thing to do is to flick your gas-guzzler on to cruise control and take in the view. If you can see beyond the huge snake of holiday traffic, there's a certain calmness about the place. Most evidence of life in the Keys' small towns comes in the form of anglers, who hang off the side of bridges or wade through the surf to indulge the islands' overwhelming passion. </p> <p>By the time you reach Key Largo, a location filled with movie mysticism but which turns out to be a relatively indistinct place, Miami will have become a distant groovy memory. Indeed, an hour down the highway, the music that had me shuffling in my seat at the start of the journey had already fizzled out to be replaced by soft rock and Dixie tunes. To put it bluntly, the landscape had become predominantly white. </p> <p>The locals of Key Largo have tried to tap into the famous Bogart film, but in truth very little of it was actually shot on location. They have, however, moored the African Queen there - right actor, wrong movie. One place that was used, though, was the Caribbean Club, the place to go for a boozy night out. Hotel reception will try to deter you because it can get a little feisty in there, but it shouldn't be missed. The car park is packed with Harleys and pick-up trucks and, once inside, the swaying mullett hairstyles are evidence of the world you have stepped into - punching a hole in a voting card could easily be a little too taxing. But they are a welcoming enough bunch, practically offering free beers as long as your pool playing is good enough to beat opponents who can barely see the table. </p> <p>Most hotels in the area will service all your watersport needs, providing diving and snorkelling equipment and booking local boats. For experienced divers, the reef is slightly second rate, being both shallow and lacking any great underwater variety, so snorkelling is both better value and more worthwhile. The visibility is excellent and the water temperature perfect throughout the year. There's the chance to sample something more exotic as well: for between $100-$125 (\u00a370-\u00a390), you can swim with dolphins at several local aquatic centres (but you need to book well in advance). </p> <p>The area's real treasure, however, is the sport-fishing, mostly to be found around Islamorada, about a 20-minute drive from Key Largo. Chartering one of the impressive wedding-cake boats costs around $550 for a half-day and $750 for eight hours, so it's not cheap, but it is worth making a sacrifice for. Bud and Mary's Marina (00 1 305 664 2461) comes highly recommended. </p> <p>The crews are able to cater for any level of competency and guarantee that no matter the time of year, there is always some species to hunt down; heading either to the reef for sailfish, marlin, king mackerel, yellowtail, snapper and grouper, or sailing into the back country for tarpon, bonefish, trout and snook. Within the first hour, our group of novices had caught enough dolphin (another name mahi mahi fish) to provide a spectacular lunch when we returned to dry land - several local restaurants make a small charge to cook your catch. </p> <p>It takes another three hours from here to reach Key West. The 42 bridges connecting the 100-mile chain of islands along Highway One get gradually longer until you reach the monumental Seven Mile Bridge, just an hour from the end of the road. It's as if the islanders were made to work increasingly hard to connect the main body of the Keys to what is considered to be the jewel in their crown. </p> <p>The atmosphere changes the moment you enter Key West. It looks like Soho in the sun, with rainbow-coloured flags flying outside most of the shops on Duval Street, the main tourist artery. The island's inhabitants go about their business at a gentle Caribbean pace, with ageing hippies, who migrated here in the 60s, providing the lifeblood of the place. </p> <p>Key West itself is best known for three things: Ernest Hemingway (its most famous former citizen), the wild partying and the world-famous sunsets. Apparently, when the drop-outs first started arriving in their psychedelic buses, life was super-chilled, enhanced of course by boat-loads of drugs that landed in town from the Gulf of Mexico. But these days, business is booming and the Keys' heritage is being sold in the hundreds of T-shirt shops on Duval Street and in the two-floored theme pubs, which all purport to sell Hemingway's favourite cocktail from the very seat the great man used to lounge in. If you want to watch your cash literally disappear into thin air, there's even a bar that flogs a five-minute hit of pure oxygen, which is supposed to leave you feeling serene and rejuvenated. It left me feeling $6 lighter and rather stupid. </p> <p>As I followed the evening procession to Mallory Square to watch the sun go down, the hope was that nobody could over-sell a natural occurrence. The huge luxury hotels, the teeming throngs and the packs of craggy street entertainers were not the worst of it. As the red orb finally fell behind the horizon leaving a spectacular neon sky, the crowd cheered with the enthusiastic whooping and hollering of a Jerry Springer audience. All this to the sound of bagpipes. That was the worst of it. </p> <p>Yet, with a bit of detective work it is possible to avoid these extremes. There are, for example, champagne cruises on luxury catamarans, which are a more serene, pleasant way to witness the beautiful sunsets. There are the younger locals' hang-outs on side streets, such as Wax Bar or Virgilio's, where they play decent music and it is possible to meet some interesting people. There are some absolutely top-quality restaurants, too, right at the opposite end of Duval, such as Mangos, whose chef is being feted as one of the best in the land. </p> <p>But the real spirit of the place is being kept alive at the more outrageous clubs, such as the drag shows at Divas or the unforgettable Atlantic Shores Beach Club. The official dress code there appears to be butt-naked (it is optional, thankfully), and a mixed crowd starts the party at sunset and continues in the same mad vein through the night. It's all a far cry from the chi-chi nightlife of Miami, but it's laid-back Key West at its very best and it's only a dead-end road away. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p> Virgin Holidays (01293 456789, <a href=\"http://www.virginholidays.co.uk\">www.virginholidays.co.uk</a>) offers a seven-night fly-drive to the Florida Keys from \u00a3553pp, including flights, car hire, three nights' accommodation at Amy Slate's Dive Resort in Key Largo and four nights at The Southernmost Motel in Key West, based on two people sharing, room only. </p> <p>For further information on the Florida Keys &amp; Key West please contact: Cellet Travel Services, 01564 794555 or visit the website: <a href=\"http://www.fla-keys.com\">www.fla-keys.com</a></p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/countries/story/0,7451,440161,00.html\">Who flies where?</a> Direct flights from the UK to the US</p>",

      "bodyText": "Miami has a buzz that touches you the moment you hit the runway. As you get into your hire car, it's practically impossible not to dispose of your jeans in favour of surf shorts, undo a few shirt buttons and reach for the shades. Flick on the stereo and the airwaves are packed with a vibrant mix of hip-hop, house and Cuban stations. With that in mind, Miami folk find it hard to fathom why anyone would turn their back on all this and head instead for the backwater of Key West, the most southern point in America, along one of the world's longest dead-end roads. But they do. In fact, more than a million people make the journey each year. One reason is the weather. While Miami has an enviable annual sun quota, the Keys have their own microclimate, which means that the gauge rarely dips below 21C or rises above 29C, and rain is uncommon. Another attraction is that along the 125-mile drive to the renowned party town of Key West, there is the opportunity to sample the aquatic delights of America's largest coral reef, namely the diving and snorkelling around Key Largo and what is continually trumpeted on local advertising hoardings as the capital of world big-game fishing, Islamorada. Highway One stretches in a straight line through the islands, from Homestead, just south of Miami, all the way to Key West and, with the speed limit set at around 50mph for almost the entire journey, the best thing to do is to flick your gas-guzzler on to cruise control and take in the view. If you can see beyond the huge snake of holiday traffic, there's a certain calmness about the place. Most evidence of life in the Keys' small towns comes in the form of anglers, who hang off the side of bridges or wade through the surf to indulge the islands' overwhelming passion. By the time you reach Key Largo, a location filled with movie mysticism but which turns out to be a relatively indistinct place, Miami will have become a distant groovy memory. Indeed, an hour down the highway, the music that had me shuffling in my seat at the start of the journey had already fizzled out to be replaced by soft rock and Dixie tunes. To put it bluntly, the landscape had become predominantly white. The locals of Key Largo have tried to tap into the famous Bogart film, but in truth very little of it was actually shot on location. They have, however, moored the African Queen there - right actor, wrong movie. One place that was used, though, was the Caribbean Club, the place to go for a boozy night out. Hotel reception will try to deter you because it can get a little feisty in there, but it shouldn't be missed. The car park is packed with Harleys and pick-up trucks and, once inside, the swaying mullett hairstyles are evidence of the world you have stepped into - punching a hole in a voting card could easily be a little too taxing. But they are a welcoming enough bunch, practically offering free beers as long as your pool playing is good enough to beat opponents who can barely see the table. Most hotels in the area will service all your watersport needs, providing diving and snorkelling equipment and booking local boats. For experienced divers, the reef is slightly second rate, being both shallow and lacking any great underwater variety, so snorkelling is both better value and more worthwhile. The visibility is excellent and the water temperature perfect throughout the year. There's the chance to sample something more exotic as well: for between $100-$125 (\u00a370-\u00a390), you can swim with dolphins at several local aquatic centres (but you need to book well in advance). The area's real treasure, however, is the sport-fishing, mostly to be found around Islamorada, about a 20-minute drive from Key Largo. Chartering one of the impressive wedding-cake boats costs around $550 for a half-day and $750 for eight hours, so it's not cheap, but it is worth making a sacrifice for. Bud and Mary's Marina (00 1 305 664 2461) comes highly recommended. The crews are able to cater for any level of competency and guarantee that no matter the time of year, there is always some species to hunt down; heading either to the reef for sailfish, marlin, king mackerel, yellowtail, snapper and grouper, or sailing into the back country for tarpon, bonefish, trout and snook. Within the first hour, our group of novices had caught enough dolphin (another name mahi mahi fish) to provide a spectacular lunch when we returned to dry land - several local restaurants make a small charge to cook your catch. It takes another three hours from here to reach Key West. The 42 bridges connecting the 100-mile chain of islands along Highway One get gradually longer until you reach the monumental Seven Mile Bridge, just an hour from the end of the road. It's as if the islanders were made to work increasingly hard to connect the main body of the Keys to what is considered to be the jewel in their crown. The atmosphere changes the moment you enter Key West. It looks like Soho in the sun, with rainbow-coloured flags flying outside most of the shops on Duval Street, the main tourist artery. The island's inhabitants go about their business at a gentle Caribbean pace, with ageing hippies, who migrated here in the 60s, providing the lifeblood of the place. Key West itself is best known for three things: Ernest Hemingway (its most famous former citizen), the wild partying and the world-famous sunsets. Apparently, when the drop-outs first started arriving in their psychedelic buses, life was super-chilled, enhanced of course by boat-loads of drugs that landed in town from the Gulf of Mexico. But these days, business is booming and the Keys' heritage is being sold in the hundreds of T-shirt shops on Duval Street and in the two-floored theme pubs, which all purport to sell Hemingway's favourite cocktail from the very seat the great man used to lounge in. If you want to watch your cash literally disappear into thin air, there's even a bar that flogs a five-minute hit of pure oxygen, which is supposed to leave you feeling serene and rejuvenated. It left me feeling $6 lighter and rather stupid. As I followed the evening procession to Mallory Square to watch the sun go down, the hope was that nobody could over-sell a natural occurrence. The huge luxury hotels, the teeming throngs and the packs of craggy street entertainers were not the worst of it. As the red orb finally fell behind the horizon leaving a spectacular neon sky, the crowd cheered with the enthusiastic whooping and hollering of a Jerry Springer audience. All this to the sound of bagpipes. That was the worst of it. Yet, with a bit of detective work it is possible to avoid these extremes. There are, for example, champagne cruises on luxury catamarans, which are a more serene, pleasant way to witness the beautiful sunsets. There are the younger locals' hang-outs on side streets, such as Wax Bar or Virgilio's, where they play decent music and it is possible to meet some interesting people. There are some absolutely top-quality restaurants, too, right at the opposite end of Duval, such as Mangos, whose chef is being feted as one of the best in the land. But the real spirit of the place is being kept alive at the more outrageous clubs, such as the drag shows at Divas or the unforgettable Atlantic Shores Beach Club. The official dress code there appears to be butt-naked (it is optional, thankfully), and a mixed crowd starts the party at sunset and continues in the same mad vein through the night. It's all a far cry from the chi-chi nightlife of Miami, but it's laid-back Key West at its very best and it's only a dead-end road away.

      "body": "<p>It's where Scott Fitzgerald got his first glimpse of the High Life, where he wrote much of The Great Gatsby, often while prone in the bars, and where he situated the wedding of Daisy Fay and Tom Buchanan. Other, less distinguished guests have included six presidents of the US and Al Capone. The gangster would dine and play blackjack in a private room, which featured a special staircase that led down to a private door, just in case he had to get away from his enemies. </p> <p>The Seelbach hotel in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, is no ordinary mid-Western hostelry. Thankfully, it is now much as it was when the brothers Seelbach opened it back in 1905 as the acme of luxury, complete with the biggest genuine Ratskeller in the world and a mass of heavily decorative marble. </p> <p>That the establishment retains its allure is all due to Roger Davis, star of the TV series Alias Smith and Jones. The place had shut down in the mid-1970s, and Davis ruined himself financially in restoring it. Today, even Miss America is prepared to use the Seelbach for her wedding reception - her beloved just happens to be the lieutenant governor of Kentucky (not a state but a commonwealth because it was originally formed from its split with Virginia). </p> <p>More relevantly for travellers, the hotel's Oak Room is probably the best restaurant in the state. No mean compliment because there's at least one other in Louisville, Lilly's Gourmet, which is probably more inventive - Kathy Cary, the owner and chef, has even contrived to transform hominy grits into a genuinely delicate delicacy. </p> <p>The thing to remember - and this was by far the most agreeable surprise to a visitor previously rather snobby about American food - is that any half-decent restaurant in Kentucky is insistent, bordering on fanatical, about the variety and freshness of the foodstuffs they and the local agricultural college encourage local farmers to produce. These are startlingly various. There's wild ginger, Kentucky hams, which once aged for a year or more would satisfy even an Italian palate, Bibb lettuce, fresh-water shrimp and a very decent Port Salut made by local Trappist monks. </p> <p>Then again, who could resist Rattlesnake Hill organic garlic? And there's even paw-paw from a nook in the woods which has a startlingly sub-tropical climate. The only dishes I could (easily) resist were the products of the local ostrich farms. </p> <p>Moreover the menus are not confined to local foods. The chefs can also buy supplies of fresh fish, including tuna and turbot, thanks to UPS, which has a hub at Louisville airport. But the chefs' greatest pride is their fried green tomatoes (as featured in the film of the same name) which are jolly good, especially when some of the spent grain from bourbon distillation is included in the batter - a residue also used to make Sour Mash Bourbon bread, while the wood from the barrels serves as splendid fuel for smoking peppers as well as sundry meats and fishes. </p> <p>But the commonwealth has more going for it than Fitzgerald and fried green tomatoes. For example, the more adventurous can try white-water rafting on the Cumberland River; or any of the spectacular caves which litter the countryside. They culminate in Mammoth Cave, the biggest cave system on earth, (and a World Heritage Site to boot) with 350 miles of passageways already discovered and 600 more still to be surveyed. </p> <p>Kentucky is quintessential USA - it's no coincidence that it houses the birthplaces of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. The contrast between history and recent past can be seen in its monuments, to Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin after witnessing a slave auction in Old Washington, to the Underground Railway that smuggled fleeing slaves to the north and freedom, and to Muhammed Ali, who has now returned to his native Louisville - where the Browns of Brown-Forman, the leading firm in the Bourbon business, provided the finance for his early career. </p> <p>The sheer scale of the country emerges in one statistic: the National Parks in Kentucky add up to one million acres, offering a beguiling mix of lakes, hills and forests, replete with trails for hiking or biking. The scenery is delightful, rolling, restful, green, without being overbearing, complete with small towns that sum up the American dream (ie fine for a shop and a stroll, boring as hell to live in). </p> <p>Perhaps this embodiment of all things American is best summed up in two museums: one in Paducah dedicated to quilts, the other in Bowling Green that celebrates the Corvette sports cars that have been manufactured for many years in the local General Motors factory. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the best-kept landscape can be seen in the famous Bluegrass country near Lexington which was once known as the \"Athens of the West\"'. Strange this: I've never heard of Athens itself being called the Lexington of the South. Anyway, it's the American equivalent of Newmarket. </p> <p>The numerous famous horse farms are home to animals belonging to such well-known owners as Queen Elizabeth. Tours provide visits to a number of them. The horses provide most of the runners for the state's thriving racing programme, which culminates in the Kentucky Derby held in early June on the Churchill Downs track in Louisville (complete with the largest equine museum in the world). These centres of excellence are also highly active stud farms - children are welcome, says the brochure, provided \"they are ready to hear an often-detailed description of how horses breed\". </p> <p>Bluegrass, also the original home of that strangely melancholy music, much played at the local music festivals, is so named because for a time in the spring its rolling grassy countryside is a purple colour, a sign of the solid limestone beneath, which not only makes for rich grass to strengthen horses' bones but also provides the clear pure water required for making the county's single best known product: Bourbon whiskey. The liquor is named after the Bourbon King Louis XVI, the Americans' most improbable ally when they revolted against theBritish in 1776. </p> <p>The Bourbon trail covers seven of the few distilleries remaining out of the hundreds that were busy before Prohibition. Nevertheless, these distilleries can produce a surprising variety of whiskies, many of dangerous smoothness, all most acceptable when drunk with ice or as a julep. The variety is due to careful selection by the blenders of the individual casks in which the whiskey is matured (but not for too long - it's at its peak at between eight and 10 years of age, becoming woody in taste if left any longer). </p> <p>None of the distilleries is industrial in scale, and they are all, as they used to say, \"picturesquely situate\", none more so than the Labrot &amp; Graham distillery which dates back to 1812 and has recently been restored by Brown Forman to make Woodford Reserve, a particularly warm and satisfying premium (or as they would prefer it \"super-premium\" whiskey. They've even installed the handsome copper-pot stills otherwise employed to distil cognac and malt whiskey. </p> <p>The site is ridiculously charming, with a handsome \"visitor centre\" overlooking the old stone buildings on the banks of a little creek that supplies the pure limestone-impregnated water required for the whiskey.

      "bodyText": "It's where Scott Fitzgerald got his first glimpse of the High Life, where he wrote much of The Great Gatsby, often while prone in the bars, and where he situated the wedding of Daisy Fay and Tom Buchanan. Other, less distinguished guests have included six presidents of the US and Al Capone. The gangster would dine and play blackjack in a private room, which featured a special staircase that led down to a private door, just in case he had to get away from his enemies. The Seelbach hotel in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, is no ordinary mid-Western hostelry. Thankfully, it is now much as it was when the brothers Seelbach opened it back in 1905 as the acme of luxury, complete with the biggest genuine Ratskeller in the world and a mass of heavily decorative marble. That the establishment retains its allure is all due to Roger Davis, star of the TV series Alias Smith and Jones. The place had shut down in the mid-1970s, and Davis ruined himself financially in restoring it. Today, even Miss America is prepared to use the Seelbach for her wedding reception - her beloved just happens to be the lieutenant governor of Kentucky (not a state but a commonwealth because it was originally formed from its split with Virginia). More relevantly for travellers, the hotel's Oak Room is probably the best restaurant in the state. No mean compliment because there's at least one other in Louisville, Lilly's Gourmet, which is probably more inventive - Kathy Cary, the owner and chef, has even contrived to transform hominy grits into a genuinely delicate delicacy. The thing to remember - and this was by far the most agreeable surprise to a visitor previously rather snobby about American food - is that any half-decent restaurant in Kentucky is insistent, bordering on fanatical, about the variety and freshness of the foodstuffs they and the local agricultural college encourage local farmers to produce. These are startlingly various. There's wild ginger, Kentucky hams, which once aged for a year or more would satisfy even an Italian palate, Bibb lettuce, fresh-water shrimp and a very decent Port Salut made by local Trappist monks. Then again, who could resist Rattlesnake Hill organic garlic? And there's even paw-paw from a nook in the woods which has a startlingly sub-tropical climate. The only dishes I could (easily) resist were the products of the local ostrich farms. Moreover the menus are not confined to local foods. The chefs can also buy supplies of fresh fish, including tuna and turbot, thanks to UPS, which has a hub at Louisville airport. But the chefs' greatest pride is their fried green tomatoes (as featured in the film of the same name) which are jolly good, especially when some of the spent grain from bourbon distillation is included in the batter - a residue also used to make Sour Mash Bourbon bread, while the wood from the barrels serves as splendid fuel for smoking peppers as well as sundry meats and fishes. But the commonwealth has more going for it than Fitzgerald and fried green tomatoes. For example, the more adventurous can try white-water rafting on the Cumberland River; or any of the spectacular caves which litter the countryside. They culminate in Mammoth Cave, the biggest cave system on earth, (and a World Heritage Site to boot) with 350 miles of passageways already discovered and 600 more still to be surveyed. Kentucky is quintessential USA - it's no coincidence that it houses the birthplaces of both Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. The contrast between history and recent past can be seen in its monuments, to Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin after witnessing a slave auction in Old Washington, to the Underground Railway that smuggled fleeing slaves to the north and freedom, and to Muhammed Ali, who has now returned to his native Louisville - where the Browns of Brown-Forman, the leading firm in the Bourbon business, provided the finance for his early career. The sheer scale of the country emerges in one statistic: the National Parks in Kentucky add up to one million acres, offering a beguiling mix of lakes, hills and forests, replete with trails for hiking or biking. The scenery is delightful, rolling, restful, green, without being overbearing, complete with small towns that sum up the American dream (ie fine for a shop and a stroll, boring as hell to live in). Perhaps this embodiment of all things American is best summed up in two museums: one in Paducah dedicated to quilts, the other in Bowling Green that celebrates the Corvette sports cars that have been manufactured for many years in the local General Motors factory. Not surprisingly, the best-kept landscape can be seen in the famous Bluegrass country near Lexington which was once known as the \"Athens of the West\"'. Strange this: I've never heard of Athens itself being called the Lexington of the South. Anyway, it's the American equivalent of Newmarket. The numerous famous horse farms are home to animals belonging to such well-known owners as Queen Elizabeth. Tours provide visits to a number of them. The horses provide most of the runners for the state's thriving racing programme, which culminates in the Kentucky Derby held in early June on the Churchill Downs track in Louisville (complete with the largest equine museum in the world). These centres of excellence are also highly active stud farms - children are welcome, says the brochure, provided \"they are ready to hear an often-detailed description of how horses breed\". Bluegrass, also the original home of that strangely melancholy music, much played at the local music festivals, is so named because for a time in the spring its rolling grassy countryside is a purple colour, a sign of the solid limestone beneath, which not only makes for rich grass to strengthen horses' bones but also provides the clear pure water required for making the county's single best known product: Bourbon whiskey. The liquor is named after the Bourbon King Louis XVI, the Americans' most improbable ally when they revolted against theBritish in 1776. The Bourbon trail covers seven of the few distilleries remaining out of the hundreds that were busy before Prohibition. Nevertheless, these distilleries can produce a surprising variety of whiskies, many of dangerous smoothness, all most acceptable when drunk with ice or as a julep. The variety is due to careful selection by the blenders of the individual casks in which the whiskey is matured (but not for too long - it's at its peak at between eight and 10 years of age, becoming woody in taste if left any longer). None of the distilleries is industrial in scale, and they are all, as they used to say, \"picturesquely situate\", none more so than the Labrot &amp; Graham distillery which dates back to 1812 and has recently been restored by Brown Forman to make Woodford Reserve, a particularly warm and satisfying premium (or as they would prefer it \"super-premium\" whiskey. They've even installed the handsome copper-pot stills otherwise employed to distil cognac and malt whiskey. The site is ridiculously charming, with a handsome \"visitor centre\" overlooking the old stone buildings on the banks of a little creek that supplies the pure limestone-impregnated water required for the whiskey. The only catch, or rather reminder of our inevitable mortality, is the cemetery conveniently placed just opposite the entrance to the distillery.

Josephine met the struggling artist and introduced him to her husband, who posed for his first official portrait. Gros went on to paint vast military scenes in which Napoleon appears as a Christ-like figure; in Napoleon Bonaparte visiting the Plague Victims at Jaffa (1804), the general touches his men's buboes; and in Napoleon Bonaparte on the Battlefield of Eylau (1808), he succours the dying.

Napoleon carried Ossian into battle. After the Terror and Robespierre's fall, Napoleon emerged as the national saviour, making himself first consul in 1799 and emperor in 1804.

Napoleon's passion is embodied in his horse; the white stallion is wild in its movements, its neck straining, its tail swishing, yet Napoleon controls it effortlessly. The horse might be the army, full of patriotic fervour, which Napoleon harnesses; it might also be a personification of the general's spirit, dynamic yet controlled. Either way, Gros's passion for Napoleon is that of a believer. He finds in the general a perfect Romantic icon. The tempestuous horse is worthy of the younger Romantic painters, of G\u00e9ricault or Delacroix. Yet there is something disturbing, and familiar, about the way Gros marshals Napoleon's cavalry. The troops, lined up in such a way that each is a perfect reproduction of the other, have the same lack of individuality as the Nazis Leni Riefenstahl's camera captured at Nuremberg.

Sometimes you have to ski the nasty stuff to get to the good stuff - or sometimes, the nasty stuff is all there is. Whatever your level of skiing, you should never stop trying to push yourself, if you want to improve. This means skiing the tough stuff, as well as the \"hero snow\". </p> <p><strong> Light and heavy snow</strong></p> <p>It may come as a surprise that not all fresh snow is alike. In mountain ranges near the sea (California, Alaska, western Canada or the Alps), it tends to be heavier, with a higher water content. As you get closer to the centre of a continent (Alberta, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado), the snow becomes drier and lighter. </p> <p>Lighter snow tends to be easier to ski, because you sink through it and usually reach the firm support of the older snow underneath. In heavy snow, such as the \"Sierra Cement\" of California, you need to be more precise and forceful with your movements, although the technique remains the same. </p> <p><strong> Crud</strong></p> <p>Fresh powder snow soon becomes \"skied out\", or \"tracked out\". This is sometimes known as \"crud\" (although this term is also used for breakable crust - see below). The problem is that the fresh snow is now packed down in some areas, and piled up in others. So the amount of resistance that your skis encounter is always changing. You need to constantly look ahead and anticipate this. When you're about to go through a deep pile, push your feet forward slightly. For the firmer sections, stand more in the middle of the ski. Rather than persisting with the short, bouncy turns of true powder, you will be better served in crud by longer, rounder, carved arcs. </p> <p><strong> Crust</strong> </p> <p>Too much wind or sun can turn the top layer of powder into a hard crust. As long as this crust remains fairly thin, skiers can break through it easily, and barely notice it. And once the crust becomes thick enough, skiers remain on top of it, and it's almost like skiing on a piste. But between these two extremes is the worst-case scenario: breakable crust. Sometimes it will support you; sometimes it will break through. There are only two reliable ways to negotiate breakable crust: jump turns, or step turns.</p> <p>With jump turns, you have to make the whole turn in the air, pivoting your feet beneath you, and only touching down to make a brief edge set. But this is exhausting, and even experts cannot keep it up for long. The other option is step turns, where you don't try to turn your skis but merely step them around, using four of five steps to complete a long turn. This is only feasible if the terrain is not too steep, and make sure you don't catch an edge doing this. </p> <p><strong> Slush</strong> </p> <p>Once the air temperature becomes warmer than the freezing point, the snow starts to melt. Its water content becomes very high, the delicate snow crystals change into large grains of ice, and \"granular snow\" or slush, is formed. These conditions make it hard to pivot your skis, because whenever your skis are moving sideways, they need to push aside large piles of heavy snow. So, to cope with slush, you need to \"round out\" your turns. This will ensure that your skis move forwards through the slush, rather than sideways. If possible, you should even try to carve these longer turns. </p> <p>With rounder turns, you will pick up speed in the middle of the turn. But as long as you finish off each turn, carving your skis all the way around across the hill, until you're nearly heading uphill, you'll always be able to bring your speed under control at the end of each turn. </p> <p><strong> Sticky snow</strong></p> <p>One more tip for the spring: when the snow gets really sticky on the lower slopes, you should aim for the higher parts of the mountain. If you have to ski low down, below the tree-line, then try to use areas of the runs that are shaded by the trees; they will be slightly cooler and less sticky. </p> <p>\u0095 Martin Bell is running ski courses for intermediate skiers this summer in Vail and Breckenridge, Colorado.

None of us goes on demos or organises petitions to say that we are generally satisfied with the government's overall performance, any more than we are likely to call the number on the back of the truck and say: \"Put me through to your boss immediately! I wish to report that one of your lorries is doing a steady 50 miles per hour along the inside lane of the motorway!\"</p> <p>The left in this country has traditionally been motivated by the outrages of the right; we have always been spurred into action by seeing horrific images of Vietnam or Ann Widdecombe's dresses. We are used to being in opposition to things; against the pit closures, against the poll tax, against extending committee meetings beyond last orders. But in as little as six weeks' time we may have the opportunity to enter a new phase - to help re-elect a Labour government for a second full term. It means campaigning in favour of something for a change. And that's why there's a whole section of the left who, though they will vote for a Labour government, will find themselves unable actually to participate in helping this come about.</p> <p>Part of the reason that Labour has spent so little time in power is that closely allied to the traditions of socialism is another \"ism\" that has always prevented us from consolidating our gains - and that's \"oppositionalism\". You may well have oppositionalists in your neighbourhood. When the local school was threatened with closure they were fantastic; organising protests, making placards - they were as active as anyone. But now the school is safe again you won't see them helping repaint the patterns in the playground on Sunday morning or running a stall at the Christmas fair. When Labour was trying to get the Tories out, the oppositionalists were tireless in their campaigning. But now that Tony Blair is organising a crowd of us to repaint the playground, they don't want anything to do with it, even if Cherie brings lemonade and sandwiches for all the helpers.</p> <p>Anyone can campaign for the Labour party when the Tories are in power; that's the easy bit. But being politically active on the left in sup port of the government of the day - that's the real challenge; that's being a David Bowie fan when the The Laughing Gnome is in the charts. One of the secret weapons of the right is that it is so comfortable with power. It comes to Tories naturally, like talking too loudly in restaurants and not ducking their heads slightly in front of the screen when they're late at the cinema.</p> <p>T he left feels awkward compromising itself with the reins of office and so there'll always be a faction who would rather remove themselves completely and snipe from the sidelines rather than be tainted by association. Much of Ken Livingstone's support was based on the fact that he was in opposition to the prime minister. Make Red Ken PM and he'd never keep those supporters; they'd switch to whoever was standing against him. The same thing would have happened if Che Guevara had ever become president. \"Tory sell-out!\" they would have shouted as Che went on the telly to talk about the tough spending choices facing his government. Like the greatest pop icons, the ultimate leftwing heroes die before they hit the middle-age of actual government. Somehow I suspect that John Lennon would not be so revered if he was alive and well and diligently working away as a member of the European parliament.</p> <p>But I regard myself as married to the Labour party. Yes, my political spouse drives me mad sometimes and yes, I confess I have fantasised about having a one-night stand with another political body. The Liberal Democrats know all the seductive chat-up lines about raising taxes, the Socialist Alliance look fresh and exciting and the far off Green party will always look greener. But I've made a commitment to Labour and just as my wife puts up with all the annoying things that she didn't know about me on our wedding day, so I tolerate all the maddening habits that Labour never warned me about before they were elected.</p> <p>Okay, so politically speaking Jack Straw picks his nose and Tony Blair uses all the hot water in the shower and John Prescott leaves his underpants for me to pick up -but it's still all worth it. Because the Labour party remains the best means by which this country can be changed for the better and that's why everyone on the left should do what they can to get this administration re-elected. Of course our political partners aren't perfect and it gets less exciting when you've been together a few years, but that's what long-term commitment is all about.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

You may well have oppositionalists in your neighbourhood. When the local school was threatened with closure they were fantastic; organising protests, making placards - they were as active as anyone. But now the school is safe again you won't see them helping repaint the patterns in the playground on Sunday morning or running a stall at the Christmas fair. When Labour was trying to get the Tories out, the oppositionalists were tireless in their campaigning. But now that Tony Blair is organising a crowd of us to repaint the playground, they don't want anything to do with it, even if Cherie brings lemonade and sandwiches for all the helpers. Anyone can campaign for the Labour party when the Tories are in power; that's the easy bit. But being politically active on the left in sup port of the government of the day - that's the real challenge; that's being a David Bowie fan when the The Laughing Gnome is in the charts. One of the secret weapons of the right is that it is so comfortable with power. It comes to Tories naturally, like talking too loudly in restaurants and not ducking their heads slightly in front of the screen when they're late at the cinema. T he left feels awkward compromising itself with the reins of office and so there'll always be a faction who would rather remove themselves completely and snipe from the sidelines rather than be tainted by association. Much of Ken Livingstone's support was based on the fact that he was in opposition to the prime minister. Make Red Ken PM and he'd never keep those supporters; they'd switch to whoever was standing against him. The same thing would have happened if Che Guevara had ever become president. \"Tory sell-out!\" they would have shouted as Che went on the telly to talk about the tough spending choices facing his government. Like the greatest pop icons, the ultimate leftwing heroes die before they hit the middle-age of actual government. Somehow I suspect that John Lennon would not be so revered if he was alive and well and diligently working away as a member of the European parliament. But I regard myself as married to the Labour party. Yes, my political spouse drives me mad sometimes and yes, I confess I have fantasised about having a one-night stand with another political body. The Liberal Democrats know all the seductive chat-up lines about raising taxes, the Socialist Alliance look fresh and exciting and the far off Green party will always look greener. But I've made a commitment to Labour and just as my wife puts up with all the annoying things that she didn't know about me on our wedding day, so I tolerate all the maddening habits that Labour never warned me about before they were elected. Okay, so politically speaking Jack Straw picks his nose and Tony Blair uses all the hot water in the shower and John Prescott leaves his underpants for me to pick up -but it's still all worth it. Because the Labour party remains the best means by which this country can be changed for the better and that's why everyone on the left should do what they can to get this administration re-elected. Of course our political partners aren't perfect and it gets less exciting when you've been together a few years, but that's what long-term commitment is all about. comment@theguardian.com",

He said: \"This pursuit can have done little or nothing to assist Emma's personality problems in the time taken to bring it to trial.\" Ms Hansen, 24, took a drugs overdose in February 1993 when she was 16 and remains severely depressed and unable to work. The judge said that she was \"a sad figure - immature, emotional, unhappy and imbued with self-pity\". Ms Hansen, from Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, alleged that a \"persistent and sustained campaign of bullying\" by five girls at Ryde high school was responsible for her continuing psychiatric injury. Isle of Wight council disputed that she was bullied or that it failed to make adequate provision for her special educational needs. Ms Hansen, who had dyslexia, transferred to the mixed comprehensive in April 1991 when her private convent closed down. Her case, in which she was legally aided, was that other pupils would snigger and point, calling her \"gormless, thick, stupid and dumb\", and intimidate her by crowding her, tripping her up and flicking bits of paper at her in class. She said that she reported the bullying but was just told to ignore it. She said: \"I used to feel physically sick walking to school with stomach pains and headaches.

He ruled that there was collusion between Ms Hansen and her friends over what evidence should be given and he exonerated the school. From the outset the school regarded Ms Hansen as having special needs because of her dyslexia and provided her with the relevant help. He said that when one looked at her history - including sexual abuse and a failed relationship - there was no basis to think that the source of her unhappiness was connected to the school.

      "body": "<p><strong> A. Light work</strong> </p> <p>If you're not suffering from information overload, you could be forgiven for feeling left out. Everyone with a job of any importance complains about being inundated by emails, deluged by voice messages and overcome by the internet - all tools designed to save time if you choose to use them that way. A message inviting callers to ring back at a certain time, disciplining yourself to check email infrequently and good search techniques could lighten your load considerably. </p> <p><strong> B. Freshly picked</strong> </p> <p>Learn to manage knowledge so that it serves rather than swamps you. Be careful about what you store and how. Good electronic and paper filing systems are essential but become unusable if too big. Be selective about what you keep: an up-to-date address book or 'favourites file' saves time, but folders full of every interesting snippet you ever came across don't. Resist the temptation to amass as much information as you can. </p> <p><strong> C. Space age</strong> </p> <p>Treat your computer, desk and brain to some free space by getting rid of clutter.

Everyone with a job of any importance complains about being inundated by emails, deluged by voice messages and overcome by the internet - all tools designed to save time if you choose to use them that way. A message inviting callers to ring back at a certain time, disciplining yourself to check email infrequently and good search techniques could lighten your load considerably. B. Freshly picked Learn to manage knowledge so that it serves rather than swamps you. Be careful about what you store and how. Good electronic and paper filing systems are essential but become unusable if too big. Be selective about what you keep: an up-to-date address book or 'favourites file' saves time, but folders full of every interesting snippet you ever came across don't. Resist the temptation to amass as much information as you can. C. Space age Treat your computer, desk and brain to some free space by getting rid of clutter. Finish tasks so you can forget about them and discard information once you've finished with it. If you worry that as soon as you get rid of something you'll find a use for it, have an interim bin that's emptied regularly.

As one of the reigning magnates of New York publishing, he had edited and \"produced\" the work of authors as various as Tennessee Williams, Richard Nixon and Joan Crawford. On this particular day, he was talking about the life and thoughts of the singer Cher, whose portrait adorned the wall behind him. And then the telephone rang and there was a message to call \"Dr\" Henry Kissinger as soon as possible. A polymath like Mr Korda knows - what with the exigencies of publishing in these vertiginous days - how to switch in an instant between Cher and high statecraft. The camera kept running, and recorded the following scene for a tape which I possess.</p> <p>Asking his secretary to get the number (759 7919 - the digits of Kissinger Associates), Mr Korda quips drily, to general laughter in the office, that it \"should be 1-800-cambodia . . . 1-800-bomb-cambodia\". After a pause of nicely calibrated duration (no senior editor likes to be put on hold while he's receiving company, especially media company), it's \"Henry - Hi, how are you? . . . You're getting all the publicity you could want in the New York Times, but not the kind you want . . . I also think it's very, very dubious for the administration to simply say yes, they'll release these papers . . . no . . . no, absolutely . . . no . . . no . . . well, hmmm, yeah. We did it until quite recently, frankly, and he did prevail . . . Well, I don't think there's any question about that, as uncomfortable as it may be . . . Henry, this is totally outrageous . . . yeah . . . Also the jurisdiction. This is a Spanish judge appealing to an English court about a Chilean head of state. So it's, it . . . Also Spain has no rational jurisdiction over events in Chile anyway so that makes absolutely no sense . . . Well, that's probably true . . . If you would. I think that would be by far and away the best . . . Right, yeah, no I think it's exactly what you should do and I think it should be long and I think it should end with your father's letter. I think it's a very important document . . . Yes, but I think the letter is wonderful, and central to the entire book. Can you let me read the Lebanon chapter over the weekend?\" At this point the conversation ends, with some jocular observations by Mr Korda about his upcoming colonoscopy: \"a totally repulsive procedure\".</p> <p>By means of the same tiny internal camera, or its forensic equivalent, one could deduce not a little about the world of Henry Kissinger from this microcosmic exchange. The first and most important thing is this. Sitting in his office at Kissinger Associates, with its tentacles of business and consultancy stretching from Belgrade to Beijing, and cushioned by innumerable other directorships and boards, he still shudders when he hears of the arrest of a dictator. Syncopated the conversation with Mr Korda may be, but it's clear that the keyword is \"jurisdiction\". What had the New York Times been reporting that fine morning? On that December 2, 1998, its front page carried the following report from Tim Weiner, the paper's national security correspondent in Washington. Under the headline \"US Will Release Files On Crimes Under Pinochet\", he wrote:</p> <p>Treading into a political and diplomatic confrontation it tried to avoid, the United States decided today to declassify some secret documents on the killings and torture committed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile . . . The decision to release such documents is the first sign that the United States will cooperate in the case against General Pinochet. Clinton Administration officials said they believed the benefits of openness in human rights cases outweighed the risks to national security in this case.</p> <p>But the decision could open \"a can of worms\", in the words of a former Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] official stationed in Chile, exposing the depth of the knowledge that the United States had about crimes charged against the Pinochet government . . .</p> <p>While some European government officials have supported bringing the former dictator to court, United States officials have stayed largely silent, reflecting skepticism about the Spanish court's power, doubts about international tribunals aimed at former foreign rulers, and worries over the implications for American leaders who might someday also be accused in foreign countries.</p> <p>President Richard M Nixon and Henry A Kissinger, who served as his national security advisor and Secretary of State, supported a right-wing coup in Chile in the early 1970s, previously declassified documents show.</p> <p>But many of the actions of the United States during the 1973 coup, and much of what American leaders and intelligence services did in liaison with the Pinochet government after it seized power, remain under the seal of national security. The secret files on the Pinochet regime are held by the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon, the National Security Council, the National Archives, the Presidential libraries of Gerald R Ford and Jimmy Carter, and other government agencies.</p> <p>According to Justice Department records, these files contain a history of human rights abuses and international terrorism:</p> <p>\u0095 In 1975 State Department officials in Chile protested the Pinochet regime's record of killing and torture, filing dissents to American foreign policy with their superiors in Washington.</p> <p>\u0095 The CIA has files on assassinations by the regime and the Chilean secret police. The intelligence agency also has records on Chile's attempts to establish an international right-wing covert-action squad.</p> <p>\u0095 The Ford Library contains many of Mr Kissinger's secret files on Chile, which have never been made public. Through a secretary, Mr Kissinger declined a request for an interview today.</p> <p>One must credit Kissinger with grasping what so many other people did not: that if the Pinochet precedent became established, then he himself was in some danger. The United States believes that it alone pursues and indicts war criminals and \"international terrorists\"; nothing in its political or journalistic culture yet allows for the thought that it might be harbouring and sheltering such a senior one. Yet the thought had very obliquely surfaced in Mr Weiner's story, and Kissinger was a worried man when he called his editor that day to discuss a memoir (eventually published under the unbearably dull and self-regarding title Years Of Renewal) that was still in progress.</p> <p>\"Harbouring and sheltering\", though, are understatements for the lavishness of Henry Kissinger's circumstances. His advice is sought, at $25,000 an appearance, by audiences of businessmen and academics and policymakers. His turgid newspaper column is syndicated by the Los Angeles Times. His first volume of memoirs was part written and also edited by Harold Evans, who with Tina Brown is among the many hosts and hostesses who solicit Kissinger's company, or perhaps, one should say, society, for those telling New York soir\u00e9es. At different times, he has been a consultant to ABC News and CBS; his most successful diplomacy, indeed, has probably been conducted with the media (and his single greatest achievement has been to get almost everybody to call him \"Doctor\"). Fawned on by Ted Koppel, sought out by corporations and despots with \"image\" problems or \"failures of communication\", and given respectful attention by presidential candidates and those whose task it is to \"mould\" their global vision, this man wants for little in the pathetic universe that the \"self-esteem\" industry exists to serve. Of whom else would Norman Podhoretz write, in a bended-knee encomium to Years Of Upheaval:</p> <p>What we have here is writing of the very highest order. It is writing that is equally at ease in portraiture and abstract analysis; that can shape a narrative as skilfully as it can paint a scene; that can achieve marvels of compression while moving at an expansive and leisurely pace. It is writing that can shift without strain or falsity of tone from the gravitas befitting a book about great historical events to the humor and irony dictated by an unfailing sense of human proportion.</p> <p>A critic who can suck like that, as was once drily said by one of my moral tutors, need never dine alone. And nor need his subject. Except that, every now and then, the recipient (and donor) of so much sycophancy feels a tremor of anxiety. He leaves the well-furnished table and scurries to the bathroom. Is it perhaps another disclosure on a newly released Nixon tape? Some stray news from Indonesia, portending the fall or imprisonment of another patron (and perhaps the escape of an awkward document or two)? The arrest or indictment of a torturer or assassin, the expiry of the statute of secrecy for some obscure cabinet papers in a faraway country - any one of these can instantly spoil his day. As we see from the Korda tape, Kissinger cannot open the morning paper with the assurance of tranquillity. Because he knows what others can only suspect, or guess at. He knows. And he is a prisoner of the knowledge as, to some extent, are we.</p> <p>Notice the likeable way in which Mr Korda demonstrates his broadmindedness with the Cambodia jest. Everybody \"knows\", after all, that Kissinger inflicted terror and misery and mass death on that country, and great injury to the United States Constitution at the same time. (Everybody also \"knows\" that other vulnerable nations can lay claim to the same melancholy and hateful distinction, with incremental or \"collateral\" damage to American democracy keeping pace.) Yet the pudgy man standing in black tie at the Vogue party is not, surely, the man who ordered and sanctioned the destruction of civilian populations, the assassination of inconvenient politicians, the kidnapping and disappearance of soldiers and journalists and clerics who got in his way? Oh, but he is. It's exactly the same man.</p> <p>And that may be among the most nauseating reflections of all. Kissinger is not invited and feted because of his exquisite manners or his mordant wit (his manners are in any case rather gross, and his wit consists of a quiver of borrowed and secondhand darts). No, he is sought after because his presence supplies a frisson: the authentic touch of raw and unapologetic power. There's a slight guilty nervousness on the edge of Mr Korda's gag about the indescribable sufferings of Indochina. And I've noticed, time and again standing at the back of the audience during Kissinger speeches, that laughter of the nervous, uneasy kind is the sort of laughter he likes to provoke. In exacting this tribute, he flaunts not the \"aphrodisiac\" of power (another of his plagiarised bons mots) but its pornography.</p> <p>In a famous expression of his contempt for democracy, Kissinger once observed that he saw no reason why a certain country should be allowed to \"go Marxist\" merely because \"its people are irresponsible\". The country concerned was Chile, which at the time of this remark had a justified reputation as the most highly evolved pluralistic democracy in the southern hemisphere of the Americas. The pluralism translated, in the years of the Cold War, into an electorate that voted about one-third conservative, one-third socialist and communist, and one-third Christian Democratic and centrist. This had made it relatively easy to keep the Marxist element from having its turn in government, and ever since 1962 the CIA had - as it had in Italy and other comparable nations - largely contented itself with funding the reliable elements.</p> <p>In September 1970, however, the Left's candidate actually gained a slight plurality of 36.2% in the presidential elections. Divisions on the Right, and the adherence of some smaller radical and Christian parties to the Left, made it a moral certainty that the Chilean Congress would, after the traditional 60-day interregnum, confirm Dr Salvador Allende as the next president. But the very name of Allende was anathema to the extreme Right in Chile, to certain powerful corporations (notably ITT, Pepsi Cola and the Chase Manhattan Bank) which did business in Chile and the United States, and to the CIA.</p> <p>This loathing quickly communicated itself to President Nixon. He was personally beholden to Donald Kendall, the president of Pepsi Cola, who had given him his first corporate account when, as a young lawyer, he had joined John Mitchell's New York firm. A series of Washington meetings, held within 11 days of Allende's electoral victory, essentially settled the fate of Chilean democracy. After discussions with interested parties, and with CIA director Richard Helms, Kissinger went with Helms to the Oval Office. Helms's notes of the meeting show that Nixon wasted little breath in making his wishes known. Allende was not to assume office. \"Not concerned risks involved. No involvement of embassy. $10,000,000 available, more if necessary. Full-time job - best men we have . . . Make the economy scream. 48 hours for plan of action.\"</p> <p>Declassified documents show that Kissinger - who had previously neither known nor cared about Chile, describing it offhandedly as \"a dagger pointed at the heart of Antarctica\" - took seriously this chance to impress his boss. A group was set up in Langley, Virginia, with the express purpose of running a \"two track\" policy for Chile: one the ostensible diplomatic one and the other - unknown to the State Department or the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry - a strategy of destabilisation, kidnap and assassination, designed to provoke a military coup.</p> <p>There were long- and short-term obstacles to the incubation of such an intervention, especially in the brief interval available before Allende took his oath of office. The long-term obstacle was the tradition of military abstention from politics in Chile, a tradition which marked off the country from its neighbours. Such a military culture was not to be degraded overnight. The short-term obstacle lay in the person of one man - General Ren\u00e9 Schneider. As chief of the Chilean General Staff, he was adamantly opposed to any military meddling in the electoral process. Accordingly, it was decided at a meeting on September 18, 1970, that General Schneider had to go.</p> <p>The plan was to have him kidnapped by extremist officers, in such a way as to make it appear that leftist and pro-Allende elements were behind the plot. The resulting confusion, it was hoped, would panic the Chilean Congress into denying Allende the presidency. A sum of $50,000 was offered around the Chilean capital, Santiago, for any officer or officers enterprising enough to take on this task. Richard Helms and his director of covert operations, Thomas Karamessines, told Kissinger that they were not optimistic. Military circles were hesitant and divided, or else loyal to General Schneider and the Chilean constitution. As Helms put it in a later account of the conversation, \"We tried to make clear to Kissinger how small the possibility of success was.\" Kissinger firmly told Helms and Karamessines to press on in any case.</p> <p>Here one must pause for a recapitulation. An unelected official in the United States is meeting with others, without the knowledge or authorisation of Congress, to plan the kidnapping of a constitution-minded senior officer in a democratic country with which the United States is not at war, and with which it maintains cordial diplomatic relations. The minutes of the meetings may have an official look to them (though they were hidden from the light of day for long enough) but what we are reviewing is a \"hit\" - a piece of state-supported terrorism.</p> <p>Continued: <a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/story/0,6761,443751,00.html\">Part Two</a></p>",

Accordingly, it was decided at a meeting on September 18, 1970, that General Schneider had to go. The plan was to have him kidnapped by extremist officers, in such a way as to make it appear that leftist and pro-Allende elements were behind the plot. The resulting confusion, it was hoped, would panic the Chilean Congress into denying Allende the presidency. A sum of $50,000 was offered around the Chilean capital, Santiago, for any officer or officers enterprising enough to take on this task. Richard Helms and his director of covert operations, Thomas Karamessines, told Kissinger that they were not optimistic. Military circles were hesitant and divided, or else loyal to General Schneider and the Chilean constitution. As Helms put it in a later account of the conversation, \"We tried to make clear to Kissinger how small the possibility of success was.\" Kissinger firmly told Helms and Karamessines to press on in any case. Here one must pause for a recapitulation. An unelected official in the United States is meeting with others, without the knowledge or authorisation of Congress, to plan the kidnapping of a constitution-minded senior officer in a democratic country with which the United States is not at war, and with which it maintains cordial diplomatic relations. The minutes of the meetings may have an official look to them (though they were hidden from the light of day for long enough) but what we are reviewing is a \"hit\" - a piece of state-supported terrorism.

      "body": "<p>When he was running Duckworth, the late Colin Haycraft, that brilliant, cantankerous publisher, used to say: \"I only publish novels by women now. Men can't do novels any more, they are only good for writing thrillers.\" At the time this remark annoyed me, being more or less a man and incurably given to writing novels. But now, six years after his death, I begin to understand what he means. When I first noticed the symptoms, I wondered whether it was simply a passing phase or a mild allergy declaring itself rather late in the day, like an intolerance of dairy products. But the thing has become so strong that I can't go on pretending it isn't there. </p> <p>The truth is that the modern novels I read with real, deep pleasure are almost all written by women. In the old days, from Fielding through to V S Naipaul (or, if you prefer, from Madame de Lafayette to Virginia Woolf), the sex of the author was a matter of indifference to me. If they were any good, male and female novelists used to give the same satisfaction. Today, by contrast, I find it is usually possible to get through the latest book by the world's famous living male novelists - let's say Saul Bellow, Mario Vargas Llosa, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Thomas Pynchon, Jos\u00e9 Saramago, Salman Rushdie - and admire the fertility of invention, the dazzling display of tricks, the riffs and cadenzas, the language, the energy. When books by these writers and their like are being discussed, I join in heartily: \"Oh, absolutely brilliant, I loved that bit where he's in this strange hotel in Boston and his ex-wife appears in the rubbish chute.\" But the pleasures I derive from most such novels have a tinny, mechanical quality. The sound effects make you jump, but that's all they do. The characters hop about like clockwork toys, running into things, bouncing off them, or disappearing over the edge - I don't care which, and the author doesn't seem to much either. The book may be, as the blurb says, \"challenging\", but rather in the way that your in-car electronics are challenging: if you read the manual very carefully, you may get the hang of it in the end, but you still can't quite see the point. </p> <p>By comparison, novels by women tend to make less noise, but the books go deeper and last longer in my mind. They may abstain from technical wizardry, they often choose a smaller, more domestic compass, but this only intensifies their art. At one time recently, I found I was reading nothing but fiction by Canadian or near-Canadian women: Alice Munro, Carol Shields, Margaret Atwood, E Annie Proulx, Jane Smiley. And what characterises the Canadian voice, as compared with American or British accents, is its very lack of offensive edge, its soft inviting timbre. Once you accept the invitation, your path may be cunningly strewn with broken glass, but the whole experience tends to be subtler, more conversational, more interior. </p> <p>Like all writers, women novelists have their faults. Carol Shields can lapse into whimsy, Anita Brookner repeats herself, Beryl Bainbridge can be a bit sketchy, Hilary Mantel can be a little flat. But even when they are below their best, I find my engagement is closer, my sympathy more alive. When I went on holiday last month, what did I take? The latest Brookner and Atwood, Jane Hamilton, Zadie Smith. </p> <p>What is the explanation? It is not because I have a weakness for soppy, sentimental stories. On the contrary, my favourite women writers tend to the bleak in their outlook. Nor is it because I have a preference for the woman's point of view, if such a thing could be said to exist. Nor do I have a particular curiosity about \"what women want\". It is true that women tend to write more and better about women, just as men write more and better about men. But it is not the balance of the subject matter that attracts me. And it isn't even because I think women are somehow deeper, more in touch with the life force. Following in the footsteps of Jane Austen, many of my favourite women writers are decidedly dry and down-to-earth. </p> <p>No, the reason, as far as I can understand it, is to do with what one thinks the novelist's art consists in - with what novels are or ought to be. The modern male novelist (henceforth MMN) prizes formal ingenuity, tricksiness, exuberance; flights of fancy and fireworks, that's what his genius specialises in. No doubt as he goes along he hopes to tell us something, whether obliquely or in your face, about the Modern Predicament or the Hell that is America. But MMN expects to be awarded more of his marks for technical merit than for artistic impression; or, rather, it is his technical merit that overwhelmingly creates the artistic impression. </p> <p>The female novelist, by contrast, follows the approach that F R Leavis characterised as the Great Tradition: that is to say, that the novel at its best creates a sort of moral poetry, in that the questions of human choice and of how life is to be lived are intrinsic to it. Of course, a truly satisfying novel will include all sorts of other things - vivid imagery, funny and touching and disgusting scenes, memorable characters - but without a moral liveliness running throughout the book it will be somehow empty. It's not like a painting or a piece of music; it's not even like a poem. The relation to life is different. Music's raw material is resonance and the intervals between notes; the novel's material is motivation and the intervals between people. Poetry can deal in single moments, the effect of light upon water or windowsills; but novels must deal in consecutive movements and the effect of people upon one another. It is a social and hence, in some measure, a narrative art, because what people do or don't do to one another has consequences which must be followed through. However cunningly disguised, there is a story in there somewhere. To get rid of the consequences and make your text free-flowing, arbitrary and timeless is to discard what is most interesting. </p> <p>I don't, of course, mean that a novel should preach a moral line or be read as a tract against some social abuse. There are famous novels that do preach - Uncle Tom's Cabin against slavery, The Forsyte Saga against property and in favour of divorce - but it is partly because of their preachiness that they don't come close to the highest class: to the level of Huckleberry Finn or Anna Karenina . You could say Zadie Smith's White Teeth , the most wonderful first novel published in 20 years, is about immigrants in Willesden, but it is no more a contribution to the race-relations industry than War and Peace is to military history. </p> <p>But what the novel does have to do is stay grounded in reality, to convey the weight of life and the difficulty - occasionally the exhilaration - of choosing and carrying on. That doesn't mean realism in a plodding sense; some of the saddest moments in modern fiction are sketched in with a couple of strokes. But what is indispensable is a certain quality of sympathy with the characters and their dilemmas. Even when raucously exposing his or her character's absurdities, the novelist must convey some fleeting sensation of what it would be like to be them. In the best of fiction, you shed a tear for the monsters too, for Casaubon in Middlemarch , for Karenin, for Captain Grimes. </p> <p>In all the modern women writers I like, even the most caustic ones - especially the most caustic ones - this quality of moral sympathy comes as naturally as a shiver on a cold night. It isn't an effect that they have striven for, and it isn't in the slightest bit sentimental. They simply take it for granted that this is how you write novels, just as George Eliot and Tolstoy took it for granted. </p> <p>By contrast, in the case of the MMN, it seems as if this moral sympathy is gradually being bred out of them, so that in the most extreme cases their work feels almost autistic. Alarmed by this, kindly critics claim to discern hidden strands of human feeling in their work. In practice, though, when the MMN plays for sympathy, he becomes blatantly mawkish. There is nothing subtle about the effect; he is rusty, his tin heart clangs. Irvine Welsh, for example, is a disgustingly funny writer, but also an unbearably soppy one. Even Saul Bellow's efforts to tweak at the heartstrings are hamfisted, sometimes embarrassingly so. </p> <p>Which brings us up against a disconcerting thought. Far from becoming increasingly sensitive and touchy-feely, the New Man seems to be running short of a female chromosome or two. What we charitably call \"laddishness\" appears to indicate some unfortunate mutation. All the hard work that went into making men understand that their lives would be infinitely richer if they encouraged the female side of their natures has had the opposite effect. Now that the heavy-lifting jobs are disappearing from industry, male novelists have decided to turn their pens into pneumatic drills, with all the accompanying noise and judder. This must be a mistake. If you are so desperate to look hard, writing fiction is not the right trade. I know Graham Greene said that every novelist needs to have an icicle in his heart, but he didn't say they needed the whole bloody fridge.</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/country/popup/0,8958,imogenmap1,00.html\">Click here for a map of Stephen King country</a></p> <p>Stephen King not only tells a good horror story but can evoke a place and the tang of its characters as well as any author today. Moreover, he sets nearly all his stories in a single place, the American state of Maine. For millions of readers worldwide, he has turned the north-eastern state into a fictional territory as compelling as Dickens's London or John Steinbeck's California. </p> <p>He does, however, have one problem: he has lived in Maine for 53 years and his neighbours don't always relish an international image of living next door to banshees, vampires and monsters. </p> <p>So King tries hard to cover his tracks. Bag of Bones, his latest bestseller, gives what masquerades as precise directions on page 75 for driving to his Dark Score Lake, where ghosts of long-slaughtered negroes rise vengefully from the waters. </p> <p>You take Interstate 95 to Newport, writes King, then Route 2 to Bethel, then Route 5 to Waterford. \"Then you take Route 68, the old County Road, across Castle View, through Motton.\" </p> <p>No, you don't - not unless you want to get irredeemably lost, as the author intends, and end up at the Atlantic ocean 50 miles south. The village names and back-country road numbers are all genuine up to Waterford, with the difference that Route 5 doesn't actually go to Waterford. Castle View and Motton are false names invented to confuse the trail. Neither is there a Route 68 marked hereabouts. </p> <p>What you must do is stick to Route 5 from Bethel as it curls south-west through the hamlet of East Stoneham, and look for signposts to Lovell Historical Society. But before you get to Lovell, take a country turn-off on the right. This is not long after you pass the Lovell volunteer fire station and just before the Suncook real estate office. (It's an unmissably palatial office because property here is very expensive.) Bear right, through woodland, and nearly a mile down a badly made-up road across a little bridge to the Loons' Nest restaurant and boatyard, you should be able to park. </p> <p>Here you will find a stretch of water as secluded, exquisite and sinister as you could wish for, blacker than almost any of Maine's other multitudinous lakes because of the dark rock which lines it, with trees planted more thickly than usual to screen its private lodges. This spot, 15 miles from the New Hampshire border, is (as all King's local friends know) the original of Dark Score Lake, where the egomaniac software billionaire Max Devore rampages with the spirits of his racist ancestors. Its real name is Kezar Lake, located south of White Mountain national forest. </p> <p>Back along Route 5, at the Lovell Historical Society, you can buy offprints of an old newspaper that tells you that Rudy Vallee and other wealthy stars of the jazz age had summer places at Kezar in the 20s. The author, himself, has a summer lodge here now. More important, it's one of the places where his imagination lives and breeds. </p> <p>It is now possible to compile a full, statewide map of these places of the imagination, a kind of Stephen King literary visitors' trail complete with precise directions for travellers. All you need to do is a little reading and chatting around and a bit of sharp map-reading. It can only be a matter of time before the tourist boards start blazoning Meet-the-Monster trails, like the cowboy trails of Texas, Oklahoma and Montana. A French website has already tried to do this, though, sadly, they've got much of the geography wrong. </p> <p>Meanwhile the delight of doing it now, of getting there ahead of the coach parties, is to discover a region and people that exist partly in the imagination, partly in their own vivid right. It's like going to Laugharne in south Wales with a copy of Under Milk Wood, the verse play Dylan Thomas set there. The best of King's stories have a comparable richness of character and landscape. </p> <p>But first a little context. \"The folk here are still rich and full-blooded,\" a character in one of his early novels says about the town of Salem's Lot, \"Their hands are plunged into the very waters of life. They have ripped the life from the earth, whole and beating. Is it not true?\" </p> <p>The character happens to be a visiting vampire, so the compliment may be double-edged. But - yes - it is true. It applies not only to Salem's Lot (which in real life is called Durham) but to the entire state, and is one of the compelling reasons why so many of the living, as opposed to the living dead, are drawn to this north-eastern territory, tucked between the Canadian border and the Atlantic, secluded by its geography and character from the main travel, trade and transport routes of the US. In the 150-year period when everybody else went west, Maine folk stayed east, grew timber and remained relatively undeveloped. </p> <p>Visitors go there now chiefly for the New England foliage in spring and autumn, the unfettered skiing and snowmobiling in winter, the hundreds of compact coastal resorts with their brilliant white lighthouses in summer and - most of all - for the scale of the mountains, forests and 2,500 lakes which effortlessly swallow up any crowds in any season. </p> <p>The state's car number plate slogan is Vacationland. You can explore its softer southern edges in a day's car hire from Boston. But the signs on its borders, The Way Life Should Be, reflect the wider claims of country people who believe that they not only settled a wilderness long ago, as did the ancestors of most Americans, but that - unusually - they still to a large extent live in one. </p> <p>Or as Rosemary Houston, retired estate agent in the lakes region town of Bridgton, fictionalised in many of King's bestsellers as Castle Rock, puts it: \"Making a farm where the side of a mountain or foothills were, on difficult land, poor land - not flatland, as much of the rest of the United States was. That's the key to here. It breeds great ingenuity.\" </p> <p>Flatlanders is the Maine putdown for anyone from almost anywhere else in the world except the Himalayas. </p> <p>Lance Tapley, editor of <a href=\"http://www.joshuamaine.com\">Joshua</a>, the state's admirable online magazine, says, \"In the American imagination, New England means two things: solid village community life, because of town meetings, and witches. The consciousness of the Salem witch trials has never left us. Plus, the New England Puritan tradition puts emphasis on the life of the mind, the life of the imagination. The Maine character of independence comes partly from that.\" </p> <p>Officially, Maine tourism encourages you to cover the state in a series of themed loops and trails, stopping overnight every 50 or 100 miles. There are loops for national parks, forests, lakes and harbours. Trails include art museums, heritage, outdoor adventure, antique shops, shopping and cuisine, particularly lobster, so cheap that you can gorge on it at roadside shacks almost everywhere or at takeaways such as Ken's Kove, Bridgton for around $8 apiece. </p> <p>With a few special add-ons, parts of Stephen King's heartland fit snugly into two of these. Start the south coast loop, as the brochures suggest, at Ogunquit, the Torquay-like resort with its three-mile beach, home of Frannie Goldsmith, heroine of The Stand. In this novel, writing of crowds on the beach, King uses a sentence which serves as a hallmark for all his stories: \"They were American people and there was a kind of dirty, compelling romance about them whenever they were in groups.\" </p> <p>Follow the official loop to Kennebunkport and Portland but detour to Durham, where the Shiloh Church is regarded as inspiration for the dreadful Marsten house in Salem's Lot. </p> <p>Rejoin the loop - but linger at Bridgton. \"You'll be hard put to fill more than a day at Bridgton,\" a big-city friend of King told me. \"Nothing happens.\" But it depends what you mean by nothing. In this town once, a mist suddenly gathered outside Federal Foods grocery store and a man tottered in, shouting, \"Something in the fog took John Lee and I heard him screaming.\" </p> <p>Mrs Carmody, owner of the Bridgton Antiquary, screamed, \"Don't go out there. I know it's death!\" And death it was. Within hours, 40ft-high Cyclopean cannibal beasts were stalking the Boston turnpike, unloosed by some slip-up in a Pentagon forerunner of Star Wars, and Mrs Carmody was demanding human sacrifices to appease them. That's according to King's celebrated 1980 novella The Mist. </p> <p>It sounds a bit hard on Bridgton, an elegantly preserved, companionable town of 4,000 people with several Carmodys in its phone book. But virtually everyone adores the legend. Federal Foods has long been superseded by a mini-mall, Shop City. But Sherry Morgan, who works at Ken's Kove and was a small child when the tale was published, says, \"Every time I go in there, I think of The Mist and burst out laughing.\" </p> <p>Three miles down Kansas Road from Shop City, deep in trees beside the 18-mile Long Lake, is Woodlands, the cluster of $630 a week holiday cabins where King and his wife Tabitha used to visit their little son, Joey, on summer camps in the 70s. Woodlands then had the only black chef on Long Lake: King put him straight into his first blockbuster, The Shining, set the last scene of that novel on the camp jetty and used a real-life tornado there as plot trigger for The Mist. </p> <p>Woodlands' owner, Jean McNell, who was there at the time, honours him for catching the reality of the state. \"Writers like Thoreau talk about the glory of the woods,\" she said. \"That's true but the real Maine is also snow, ice storms and the blackflies that bore in and suck your blood\". </p> <p>Bridgton is the territory, too, for The Dark Half, Cujo, Needful Things, The Body (filmed as Stand By Me) and part of The Dead Zone. But for the best stocked heartland, follow the Acadia national park loop up through Bar Harbor resort to Bangor. Here - in a 15-mile radius - are Orrington (setting for Pet Semetary), Hampden (Carrie) and Troy (The Tommyknockers). </p> <p>Bangor, an ex-Victorian lumber town which King disguises as Derry, produced the entrancing jewel of all his work, IT, an 1,100-page small-town epic of childhood like Under Milk Wood and Lord of the Rings rolled into one, a story as potent as Philip Pullman's Northern Lights. Bangor tourism would gain immensely from a horror museum. But King and his wife don't want one and they are so cherished that the town respects their wishes. However, your first call should be on the eru dite Stu Tinker at Betts Bookshop at the corner of Hammond and East. He'll give you, as he does to thousands of callers a year, a map teeming with sites dear to IT's readers. </p> <p>Mostly, King's monsters play straightforwardly on old collective guilts about the maltreatment of negroes and Algonquian Indians in New England's frontier years. The creature from Derry's sewers in IT who preys on children (and is defeated by a gang of them) personifies old corporate greeds and lusts. King, who lives in an old lumber baron's mansion with a bronze vampire on its gate, knows all about these. </p> <p>But this year a creature more terrible than Max Devore is stalking Bangor. The world's seventh richest man, S Robson Walton, boss of Wal-Mart, is pressing to build a \"super-Wal-Mart\" four miles out: it will suck the last of the commercial life from the city's superbly intact dark brick centre as surely as anything in The Mist. But, as citizens are finding, some spectres cannot be exorcised by the power of the pen. So if you want to see King's Derry, get there fast. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong></p> <p>Icelandair (020-7874 1000) operates one flight daily from London via Reykjavik to Boston with prices from \u00a3160pp. </p> <p><strong> Accommodation:</strong> The Beachmere in Ogunquit (tel: 00 1 207 646 2021, <a href=\"http://www.beachmereinn.com\">www.beachmereinn.com</a>) rates from $55 (\u00a339) to $325 (\u00a3229) per room per night.Noble House, Bridgton, (tel: 00 1 207 647 3733, <a href=\"http://www.noblehousebb.com\">www.noblehousebb.com</a>) from $90 (\u00a364) to $149 (\u00a3105) per room per night.

With a few special add-ons, parts of Stephen King's heartland fit snugly into two of these. Start the south coast loop, as the brochures suggest, at Ogunquit, the Torquay-like resort with its three-mile beach, home of Frannie Goldsmith, heroine of The Stand. In this novel, writing of crowds on the beach, King uses a sentence which serves as a hallmark for all his stories: \"They were American people and there was a kind of dirty, compelling romance about them whenever they were in groups.\" Follow the official loop to Kennebunkport and Portland but detour to Durham, where the Shiloh Church is regarded as inspiration for the dreadful Marsten house in Salem's Lot. Rejoin the loop - but linger at Bridgton. \"You'll be hard put to fill more than a day at Bridgton,\" a big-city friend of King told me. \"Nothing happens.\" But it depends what you mean by nothing. In this town once, a mist suddenly gathered outside Federal Foods grocery store and a man tottered in, shouting, \"Something in the fog took John Lee and I heard him screaming.\" Mrs Carmody, owner of the Bridgton Antiquary, screamed, \"Don't go out there. I know it's death!\" And death it was. Within hours, 40ft-high Cyclopean cannibal beasts were stalking the Boston turnpike, unloosed by some slip-up in a Pentagon forerunner of Star Wars, and Mrs Carmody was demanding human sacrifices to appease them. That's according to King's celebrated 1980 novella The Mist. It sounds a bit hard on Bridgton, an elegantly preserved, companionable town of 4,000 people with several Carmodys in its phone book. But virtually everyone adores the legend. Federal Foods has long been superseded by a mini-mall, Shop City. But Sherry Morgan, who works at Ken's Kove and was a small child when the tale was published, says, \"Every time I go in there, I think of The Mist and burst out laughing.\" Three miles down Kansas Road from Shop City, deep in trees beside the 18-mile Long Lake, is Woodlands, the cluster of $630 a week holiday cabins where King and his wife Tabitha used to visit their little son, Joey, on summer camps in the 70s. Woodlands then had the only black chef on Long Lake: King put him straight into his first blockbuster, The Shining, set the last scene of that novel on the camp jetty and used a real-life tornado there as plot trigger for The Mist. Woodlands' owner, Jean McNell, who was there at the time, honours him for catching the reality of the state. \"Writers like Thoreau talk about the glory of the woods,\" she said. \"That's true but the real Maine is also snow, ice storms and the blackflies that bore in and suck your blood\". Bridgton is the territory, too, for The Dark Half, Cujo, Needful Things, The Body (filmed as Stand By Me) and part of The Dead Zone. But for the best stocked heartland, follow the Acadia national park loop up through Bar Harbor resort to Bangor. Here - in a 15-mile radius - are Orrington (setting for Pet Semetary), Hampden (Carrie) and Troy (The Tommyknockers). Bangor, an ex-Victorian lumber town which King disguises as Derry, produced the entrancing jewel of all his work, IT, an 1,100-page small-town epic of childhood like Under Milk Wood and Lord of the Rings rolled into one, a story as potent as Philip Pullman's Northern Lights. Bangor tourism would gain immensely from a horror museum. But King and his wife don't want one and they are so cherished that the town respects their wishes. However, your first call should be on the eru dite Stu Tinker at Betts Bookshop at the corner of Hammond and East. He'll give you, as he does to thousands of callers a year, a map teeming with sites dear to IT's readers. Mostly, King's monsters play straightforwardly on old collective guilts about the maltreatment of negroes and Algonquian Indians in New England's frontier years. The creature from Derry's sewers in IT who preys on children (and is defeated by a gang of them) personifies old corporate greeds and lusts. King, who lives in an old lumber baron's mansion with a bronze vampire on its gate, knows all about these. But this year a creature more terrible than Max Devore is stalking Bangor. The world's seventh richest man, S Robson Walton, boss of Wal-Mart, is pressing to build a \"super-Wal-Mart\" four miles out: it will suck the last of the commercial life from the city's superbly intact dark brick centre as surely as anything in The Mist. But, as citizens are finding, some spectres cannot be exorcised by the power of the pen. So if you want to see King's Derry, get there fast.

So popular has the US become that some tour operators no longer think of it as a long-haul destination. It is hardly surprising. America seems custom built for travellers as the choice of attractions and activities is immense. Here is a small selection. </p> <p><strong> Boston and New England</strong></p> <p>One of the most atmospheric and walker-friendly cities in the US, Boston will boast another new attraction later this year when its already impressive New England Aquarium adds an IMAX theatre seating 400 people and able to show films in 3D. It is due to open this autumn. </p> <p>You could combine a few days there with a stay in a rented house in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island or New York State. Clapboard houses with verandas - Americans call them decks - overlooking water are among the properties on offer from New England Country Homes (08700 774774). Prices start at \u00a3694pp for two weeks, based on four sharing. That includes scheduled flights, a rental car, insurance and the first night in a hotel on the outskirts of Boston. The company can also organise hotels downtown. </p> <p>Provided you avoid the peak summer months of July and August, when the roads are jammed and the beaches crowded, Cape Cod can be heaven. An ink-blue Atlantic crashes on long white, empty sands. Go hiking among the dunes or along boardwalk trails where flowers and trees are identified. Rent bicycles and pedal car-free routes such as the 25-mile Cape Cod Rail Trail, which, as the name suggests, is a former train line. And go whale watching from salty Provincetown at the Cape's far tip. Osprey Holidays (0870 2414217) offers stays at The Captain Farris House, a 19th-century sea captain's home in a part of South Yarmouth settled by Quakers, from \u00a360pp per night. </p> <p><strong> Florida</strong><br> </p> <p>A hotel surrounded by its own 30-acre wildlife reserve, Disney's 1,307-room Animal Kingdom Lodge opens on April 16. The five-storey property is circular, and bedrooms are from the first floor up, so all guests get a close look at animals and birds including zebra, giraffe, Thomson's gazelle, flamingoes and African spoonbills - up close. Among the tour operators offering packages there is Unijet (08705 336336), which has holidays from \u00a31,599 if two share a room or \u00a31,189 if four share. </p> <p>Stay at the Courtyard by Marriott in Downtown Disney Resort and you can get access to three theme parks - the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and MGM Studios - an hour earlier than everyone else on certain days. One week packages there are available from Virgin Holidays (01293 456789). Prices start at \u00a3549. </p> <p>For the flip side of Florida, try Sarasota-based Walk on the Wild Side, which offers half-day eco tours - on foot or by canoe or kayak. Enter your preferences online at <a href=\"http://www.walkwild.com\">www.walkwild.com</a>. Tours start at around \u00a322. Or learn to sail in the Florida Keys. Steve &amp; Doris Colgate's Off shore Sailing School has just launched a new branch at Hawks Cay. Customers cast off from there and spend six days sailing down to Hemingway's old home at Key West. Based on double occupancy, it costs $1,661 a head, including instruction and meals. You could do that as part of a two week fly drive with Bon Voyage (0800 3160194), which offers flights from Gatwick to Miami with car hire from \u00a3438 a head. </p> <p><strong> City breaks</strong></p> <p>No longer is it just East Coast cities such as New York and Boston that attract short break visitors. Travelscene (0870 7774445) has added New Orleans, Louisiana, and Las Vegas, Nevada, and restored San Francisco to a programme that now includes no fewer than eight US destinations. Three nights in New Orleans in April or May, for example, cost \u00a3533 a head, based on two sharing. That gets you a three-star hotel and scheduled flights with American Airlines from Heathrow. It is now even possible to gamble in the back of a cab in Las Vegas. Some taxis have touch screen systems that allow passengers to win coupons redeemable with local firms. A Travelscene break there, including accommodation at Circus Circus, costs \u00a3460 between April 1 and 21. </p> <p><strong> California</strong></p> <p>From Venice Beach to the wine-growing Napa Valley, California is best seen on a fly drive. United Vacations (0870 6062222) can do a fortnight in May for \u00a3526 a head, with flight to Los Angeles or San Francisco. A whole new theme park has opened in LA's Anaheim called Disney's California Adventure. Virgin is among the operators offering packages there, with one week starting at \u00a3999. </p> <p>Away from the cities, Backcountry Trail Guides (<a href=\"http://www.backcountrytrailguides.com\">www.backcountrytrailguides.com</a>) will pick you up from your San Diego hotel and take you on any of four \"moderate to strenuous\" hiking routes in the Cuyamaca mountains. Walkers are promised sweeping desert views, high mountain peaks and hidden waterfalls. Their full-day guided hike costs $75. Or go whale watching from San Francisco. Eight hour trips to spot humpback and blue whales off the Farallon Islands, not to mention sea lions and no end of birds, are on offer from Oceanic Society Expeditions (001 415 4411106). Check dates. Last year, they ran from June to November. Expect to pay around \u00a345. Until spring, shorter trips in search of migrating grey whales are available. Pick one up at Bodega Bay, about 90 minutes north of San Francisco. They cost around \u00a322. </p> <p><strong> Riding the range</strong></p> <p>Even those most deeply sceptical about the appeal of horse riding might be converted by a canter through the sagebrush and cactus. A cattle and buffalo ranch in New Mexico is the latest to be offered by specialist American Round-Up (01404 881777). The firm, which has around 50 US guest ranches in its programme, offers customers weekends at its Devon base learning to ride Western-style before they leave for the US. The weekends cost from \u00a3275pp for three days/two nights. A week in New Mexico costs \u00a3830pp. That includes all meals and riding, though you would have to allow around \u00a3500 to get there and back.The ranch is in the Gila National Wilderness in the south-west of the state. </p> <p><strong> On yer bike</strong></p> <p>The \"slick rock\" around Moab in Utah can be searing hot in high summer - but it makes for formidable off-road biking. Saddle Skedaddle (0191-265 1110) offers a 16-day holiday that combines six days in the saddle with some hiking and sightseeing. The trip also takes in Monument Valley - backdrop for Westerns including John Ford's Stagecoach and Cheyenne Autumn- the Grand Canyon and the stunning rock patterns of Zion National Park whose Gooseberry Mesa and Jem Trail. Departure is on September 16. The price, which covers accommodation, (mainly camping) most meals and a transport/back-up vehicle, is \u00a31,250. Flights are extra. Take your own bike or hire one. </p> <p><strong> Birdwatching</strong></p> <p>Follow the roadrunner across Arizona. Naturetrek (01962 733051 <a href=\"http://www.naturetrek.co.uk\">www.naturetrek.co.uk</a>) is offering a 17-day escorted birdwatching tour which covers the south of the state and finishes at Big Sur, on the Pacific coast of California. You might spot the bird that became a cartoon character in the desert around Tucson. Customers will also visit the Chiricahua and Huachuca mountains, home to rare birds such as the rose-throated becard, the thick-billed kingfisher and to more than 15 kinds of hummingbird. Departure is on July 29 from London and the price, which includes scheduled flights accommodation and expert guiding, is \u00a32,595. </p> <p><strong> Southern states</strong></p> <p>With their uncompromising religion, racist past and curious drink laws, the southern states have a special and sometimes awful fascination. Unijet (08705 336336), which launched a dedicated America brochure last August, has now published a new edition with a section concentrating on the Deep South. This offers hotel-only deals to be booked in conjunction with flights and car hire. Destinations covered are Memphis, with Elvis Presley's Graceland; Nashville, home to the Grand Ole Opry; New Orleans and the Emerald Coast on the north-west Gulf coast of Florida. </p> <p> <strong> North to Alaska</strong> </p> <p>Watch grizzly bears scoop salmon from teeming rivers; spot moose and caribou. Explore Worldwide (01252 760100) offers a 17-day tour of Alaska with departures between June and August. It takes in Anchorage, Denali National Park, Chena Hot Springs and Keystone Canyon. The trip costs \u00a31,595, including scheduled flights, camping accommodation and three nights in hotels - and some meals. </p> <p><strong> Golf</strong></p> <p>Arizona now rivals Florida and South Carolina as one of America's leading golf states, according to Lotus Supertravel (020-7962 9494). There are over 100 courses at Scottsdale, just outside Phoenix, and if you get fed up with walking between greens you could always head off to the old western town of Tombstone. The company offers seven-day packages there from \u00a3579pp, including BA flights to Phoenix, accommodation and a hire car. Golf packages allowing five rounds start at \u00a3115. </p> <p> <strong> National parks</strong> </p> <p>Yellowstone is arguably the most famous; The Great Smoky Mountains, in Tennessee and North Carolina, are the most visited; Colorado's Mesa Verde, where the Anasazi Indian built their stupendous cliff dwellings, is perhaps the most intriguing; California's Yosemite and Utah's Bryce Canyon, with its translucent rock spires, are among the most spectacularly beautiful. British Airways Holidays (0870 2424243) offers several relevant pre-planned self-drive tours. One starts in Seattle, takes you into Canada to Banff National Park in the Rockies and turns south across the border again, to Glacier and Yellowstone Parks. Without flights, it costs from \u00a3681pp, based on two sharing. Return flights start at \u00a3384 but go up to \u00a3640 in the summer peak. Glacier and Yellowstone feature with the lava fields of Idaho's Craters of the Moon in a fly-drive itinerary offered by Kuoni (01306 747000). Besides Idaho, the route takes in the Canadian Rockies, Washington State, Montana. It costs from \u00a31,038 each based on two sharing, including flights and accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Motorhomes</strong></p> <p>Renting a motorhome or RV (recreational vehicle) is a great way to see the American outdoors. Commercial sites such as those operated by KOA (Kampgrounds of America - bookable on 08705 143610) or those in national and state parks usually have grills on which you can barbecue. You'll need to do some arithmetic to work out if it is more economic than a fly-drive, bearing in mind heavy fuel consumption, payments for mileage and the provision of sleeping bags and cooking gear, and top-up insurance to reduce the hefty excess - which could be around \u00a32,000 - if you damage the vehicle. One company offering motorhomes is Trailfinders (020-7937 5400). Prices depend on availability. </p> <p><strong> White-water rafting</strong></p> <p>Rafting on the Colorado River is an experience to live in the memory. Between rapids you drift noiselessly beneath great walls of red sandstone, flopping now and then into the water to cool off. Guides invariably have broad knowledge of local wildlife and folklore. Abercrombie &amp; Kent (0845 0700610) includes four days on the river in an up-market, 11-day tour which also takes in Arches and Canyonlands National Parks plus a stay at the Sorrel River Resort in Utah, where you could go hiking, riding, kayaking or just hang around the pool. The holiday costs from \u00a33,499, based on two sharing. </p> <p> \u2022 <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/countries/story/0,7451,440161,00.html\">Who flies where?</a> Direct flights from the UK to the US</p>",

Besides Idaho, the route takes in the Canadian Rockies, Washington State, Montana. It costs from \u00a31,038 each based on two sharing, including flights and accommodation. Motorhomes Renting a motorhome or RV (recreational vehicle) is a great way to see the American outdoors. Commercial sites such as those operated by KOA (Kampgrounds of America - bookable on 08705 143610) or those in national and state parks usually have grills on which you can barbecue. You'll need to do some arithmetic to work out if it is more economic than a fly-drive, bearing in mind heavy fuel consumption, payments for mileage and the provision of sleeping bags and cooking gear, and top-up insurance to reduce the hefty excess - which could be around \u00a32,000 - if you damage the vehicle. One company offering motorhomes is Trailfinders (020-7937 5400). Prices depend on availability. White-water rafting Rafting on the Colorado River is an experience to live in the memory. Between rapids you drift noiselessly beneath great walls of red sandstone, flopping now and then into the water to cool off. Guides invariably have broad knowledge of local wildlife and folklore. Abercrombie &amp; Kent (0845 0700610) includes four days on the river in an up-market, 11-day tour which also takes in Arches and Canyonlands National Parks plus a stay at the Sorrel River Resort in Utah, where you could go hiking, riding, kayaking or just hang around the pool. The holiday costs from \u00a33,499, based on two sharing. \u2022 Who flies where? Direct flights from the UK to the US",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/story/0,6761,443407,00.html\">Part one</a> </p> <p>Ambassador Korry has testified that he told his embassy staff to have nothing to do with a group styling itself Patria y Libertad (Fatherland and Freedom), a quasi-fascist group intent on defying the election results. He sent three cables to Washington warning his superiors to have nothing to do with them either. He was unaware that his own military attach\u00e9s had been told to contact the group and keep the fact from him. And when the outgoing president of Chile, the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei, announced that he was opposed to any US intervention and would vote to confirm the legally elected Allende, it was precisely to this gang that Kissinger turned. </p> <p>On October 15, 1970, Kissinger was told of an extremist right-wing officer named General Roberto Viaux, who had ties to Patria y Libertad and who was willing to accept the secret US commission to remove General Schneider from the chessboard. The term \"kidnap\" was still being employed at this point, and is often employed still. However, Kissinger's Track Two group authorised the supply of machine guns as well as tear gas grenades to Viaux's associates, and never seems to have asked what they would do with the general once they had kidnapped him. </p> <p>Let the documents tell the story. A CIA cable to Kissinger's Track Two group from Santiago dated October 18, 1970, reads (with the names still blacked out for \"security\" purposes and cover identities written in by hand - in my square brackets - by the ever-thoughtful redaction service): </p> <p> 1. [Station cooptee] met clandestinely evening 17 Oct with [two Chilean armed forces officers] who told him their plans were moving along better than had thought possible. They asked that by evening 18 Oct [cooptee] arrange furnish them with eight to ten tear gas grenades. Within 48 hours they need three 45 calibre machine guns (\"grease guns\") with 500 rounds ammo each. [One officer] commented has three machine guns himself but can be identified by serial numbers as having been issued to him therefore unable use them. </p> <p>2. [Officers] said they have to move because they believe they now under suspicion and being watched by Allende supporters. [One officer] was late to meeting having taken evasive action to shake possible surveillance by one or two taxi cabs with dual antennas which he believed being used by opposition against him. </p> <p>3. [Cooptee] asked if [officers] had Air Force contacts. They answered they did not but would welcome one. [Cooptee] separately has since tried contact [a Chilean Air Force General] and will keep trying until established. Will urge [Air Force General] meet with [other two officers] a.s.a.p. [Cooptee] commented to station that [Air Force General] has not tried contact him since ref a talk. </p> <p>4. [Cooptee] comment: cannot tell who is leader of this movement but strongly suspects it is Admiral [Deleted]. It would appear from [his contact's] actions and alleged Allende suspicions about them that unless they act now they are lost. Trying get more info from them evening 18 Oct about support they believe they have. </p> <p>5. Station plans give six tear gas grenades (arriving noon 18 Oct by special courier) to [cooptee] for delivery to [armed forces officers] instead of having [false flag officer] deliver them to Viaux group. Our reasoning is that [cooptee] dealing with active duty officers. Also [false flag officer] leaving evening 18 Oct and will not be replaced but [cooptee] will stay here. Hence important that [cooptee] credibility with [armed forces officers] be strengthened by prompt delivery what they requesting. Request headquarters agreement by 1500 hours local time 18 Oct on decision delivery of tear gas to [cooptee] vice [false flag officer]. </p> <p>6. Request prompt shipment three sterile 45 calibre machine guns and ammo per para 1 above, by special courier if necessary. Please confirm by 2000 hours local time 18 Oct that this can be done so [cooptee] may inform his contacts accordingly. </p> <p> The reply, which is headed \"Immediate Santiago (Eyes Only [Deleted])\" is dated October 18 and reads: </p> <p> Sub-machine guns and ammo being sent by regular [deleted] courier leaving Washington 0700 hours 19 October due arrive Santiago late evening 20 October or early morning 21 October. Preferred use regular [deleted] courier to avoid bringing undue attention to op. </p> <p> A companion message, also addressed to \"Santiago 562\", went like this: </p> <p> 1. Depending how [cooptee] conversation goes evening 18 October you may wish submit Intel report [deleted] so we can decide whether should be dissemed. 2. New subject. If [cooptee] plans lead coup, or be actively and publicly involved, we puzzled why it should bother him if machine guns can be traced to him. Can we develop rationale on why guns must be sterile? Will continue make effort provide them but find our credulity stretched by Navy [officer] leading his troops with sterile guns? What is special purpose for these guns? We will try send them whether you can provide explanation or not. </p> <p> The full beauty of this cable traffic cannot be fully appreciated without a reading of another message, dated October 16. (It should, however, be borne in mind that the Chilean Congress was to meet to confirm Dr Salvador Allende as president on the 24th of that month.) </p> <p> 1. [Deleted/handwritten code name Trickturn] policy, objectives and actions were reviewed at high USG [United States Government] level afternoon 15 October. Conclusions, which are to be your operational guide, follow: </p> <p>2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup. It would be much preferable to have this transpire prior to 24 October but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously beyond this date. We are to continue to generate maximum pressure toward this end utilizing every appropriate resource. It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG and American hand be well hidden. [italics added] While this imposes on us a high degree of selectivity in making military contacts and dictates that these contacts be made in the most secure manner it definitely does not preclude contacts such as reported in Santiago 544 which was a masterful piece of work. </p> <p>3. After the most careful consideration it was determined that a Viaux coup attempt carried out by him alone with the forces now at his disposal would fail. Thus, it would be counterproductive to our [deleted; handwritten insert \"Track Two\"] objectives. It was decided that [deleted; handwritten insert \"CIA\"] get a message to Viaux warning him against precipitate action. In essence our message is to state, \"We have reviewed your plans, and based on your information and ours, we come to the conclusion that your plans for a coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may reduce your capabilities for the future. Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you together with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" You are requested to deliver the message to Viaux essentially as noted above. Our objectives are as follows: (A) To advise him of our opinion and discourage him from acting alone; (B) Continue to encourage him to amplify his planning; (C) Encourage him to join forces with other coup planners so that they may act in concert either before or after 24 October. (N.B. Six gas masks and six CS cannisters [sic] are being carried to Santiago by special [deleted] courier ETD Washington 1100 hours 16 October.) </p> <p>4. There is great and continuing interest in the activities of Tirado, Canales, Valenzuela et al and we wish them maximum good fortune. </p> <p>5. The above is your operating guidance. No other policy guidance you may receive from [indecipherable: State?] or its maximum exponent in Santiago, on his return, are to sway you from your course. </p> <p>6. Please review all your present and possibly new activities to include propaganda, black operations, surfacing of intelligence or disinformation, personal contacts, or anything else your imagination can conjure which will permit you to press forward our [deleted] objective in a secure manner. </p> <p> Finally, it is essential to read the White House \"memorandum of conversation\", dated October 15, 1970, to which the above cable directly refers and of which it is a more honest summary. Present for the \"high USG level\" meeting were, as noted in the heading: \"Dr Kissinger, Mr Karamessines, Gen Haig.\" The first paragraph of their deliberations has been entirely blacked out, with not so much as a scribble in the margin from the redaction service. (Given what has since been admitted, this 20-line deletion must be well worth reading.) Picking up at paragraph two, we find the following: </p> <p> 2. Then Mr Karamessines provided a run-down on Viaux, the Canales meeting with Tirado, the latter's new position [after Porta was relieved of command \"for health reasons\"] and, in some detail, the general situation in Chile from the coup possibility viewpoint. </p> <p>3. A certain amount of information was available to us concerning Viaux's alleged support throughout the Chilean military. We had assessed Viaux's claims carefully, basing our analysis on good intelligence from a number of sources. Our conclusion was clear: Viaux did not have more than one chance in 20 - perhaps less - to launch a successful coup. </p> <p>4. The unfortunate repercussions, in Chile and internationally, of an unsuccessful coup were discussed. Dr Kissinger ticked off his list of these negative possibilities. His items were remarkably similar to the ones Mr Karamessines had prepared. </p> <p>5. It was decided by those present that the Agency must get a message to Viaux warning him against any precipitate action. In essence our message was to state: \"We have reviewed your plans, and based on your information and ours, we come to the conclusion that your plans for a coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may reduce your capabilities for the future. Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" </p> <p>6. After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux coup plot, at least temporarily, Dr Kissinger instructed Mr Karamessines to preserve Agency assets in Chile, working clandestinely and securely to maintain the capability for Agency operations against Allende in the future. </p> <p>7. Dr Kissinger discussed his desire that the word of our encouragement to the Chilean military in recent weeks be kept as secret as possible. Mr Karamessines stated emphatically that we had been doing everything possible in this connection, including the use of false flag officers, car meetings and every conceivable precaution. But we and others had done a great deal of talking recently with a number of persons. For example, Ambassador Korry's wideranging discussions with numerous people urging a coup \"cannot be put back into the bottle.\" [Three lines of deletion follow.] [Dr Kissinger requested that copy of the message be sent to him on 16 October.] </p> <p> The meeting concluded on Dr Kissinger's note that the Agency should continue keeping the pressure on every Allende weak spot in sight: now, after October 24, after November 5, and into the future until such time as new marching orders are given. Mr Karamessines stated that the Agency would comply. </p> <p>So Track Two contained two tracks of its own. Track Two/One was the group of ultras led by General Viaux and his sidekick Captain Arturo Marshal. These men had tried to bring off a coup in 1969 against the Christian Democrats; they had been cashiered and were disliked even by conservatives in the officer corps. \"Track Two/Two\" was a more ostensibly \"respectable\" faction headed by General Camilo Valenzuela, the chief of the garrison in the capital city, whose name occurs in the cables above and whose identity is concealed by some of the deletions. Several of the CIA operatives in Chile felt that Viaux was too much of a mad-dog to be trusted. And Ambassador Korry's repeated admonitions also had their effect. </p> <p> As shown in the October 15 memo cited above, Kissinger and Karamessines developed last-minute second thoughts about Viaux, who as late as October 13 had been given $20,000 in cash from the CIA station and promised a life insurance policy of $250,000. This offer was authorised direct from the White House. However, with only days to go before Allende was inaugurated, and with Nixon repeating that \"it was absolutely essential that the election of Mr Allende to the Presidency be thwarted\", the pressure on the Valenzuela group became intense. As a direct consequence, especially after the warm words of encouragement he had been given, General Viaux felt himself under some obligation to deliver also, and to disprove those who had doubted him. </p> <p>On the evening of October 19, 1970, the Valenzuela group, aided by some of Viaux's gang, and equipped with the tear gas grenades delivered by the CIA, attempted to grab General Schneider as he left an official dinner. The attempt failed because he left in a private car and not the expected official vehicle. The failure produced an extremely significant cable from CIA headquarters in Washington to the local station, asking for urgent action because \"Headquarters must respond during morning 20 October to queries from high levels.\" </p> <p>Payments of $50,000 each to General Viaux and his chief associate were then authorised on the condition that they made another attempt. On the evening of October 20, they did. But again there was only failure to report. On October 22, the \"sterile\" machine guns above-mentioned were handed to Valenzuela's group for another try. Later that same day, General Viaux's gang finally murdered General Schneider. </p> <p>According to the later verdict of the Chilean military courts, this atrocity partook of elements of both tracks of Track Two. In other words, Valenzuela was not himself on the scene but the assassination squad, led by Viaux, contained men who had participated in the preceding two attempts. Viaux was convicted on charges of kidnapping and of conspiring to cause a coup. Valenzuela was convicted of the charge of conspiracy to cause a coup. So any subsequent attempt to distinguish the two plots from each other, except in point of degree, is an attempt to confect a distinction without a difference. </p> <p>It scarcely matters whether Schneider was slain because of a kidnapping scheme that went awry (he was said, but only by the assassins, to have had the temerity to resist) or whether his assassination was the objective in the first place. The Chilean military police report, as it happens, describes a straightforward murder. Under the law of every law-bound country (including the United States), a crime committed in the pursuit of a kidnapping is thereby aggravated, not mitigated. You may not say, with a corpse at your feet, \"I was only trying to kidnap him.\" At least, you may not say so if you hope to plead extenuating circumstances. </p> <p> Yet a version of \"extenuating circumstances\" has become the paper-thin cover story with which Kissinger has since protected himself from the charge of being an accomplice, before and after the fact, in kidnap and murder. And this sorry cover story has even found a refuge in the written record. The Senate Intelligence Committee, in its investigation of the matter, concluded that since the machine guns supplied to Valenzuela had not actually been employed in the killing, and since General Viaux had been officially discouraged by the CIA a few days before the murder, there was therefore \"no evidence of a plan to kill Schneider or that United States officials specifically anticipated that Schneider would be shot during the abduction\". </p> <p>Walter Isaacson, one of Kissinger's biographers, takes at face value a memo from Kissinger to Nixon after his meeting on October 15 with Karamessines, in which he reports to the president that he had \"turned off\" the Viaux plot. He also takes at face value the claim that Viaux's successful hit was essentially unauthorised.</p> <p>These excuses and apologies are as logically feeble as they are morally contemptible. Henry Kissinger bears direct responsibility for the Schneider murder, as the following points demonstrate.</p> <p>1. Brian MacMaster, one of the \"false flag\" agents mentioned in the cable traffic above, a career CIA man carrying a forged Colombian passport and claiming to represent American business interests in Chile, has told of his efforts to get \"hush money\" to jailed members of the Viaux group, after the assassination and before they could implicate the Agency.</p> <p>2. Colonel Paul M Wimert, a military attache in Santiago and chief CIA liaison officer with the Valenzuela faction, has testified that after the Schneider killing he hastily retrieved the two payments of $50,000 that had been paid to Valenzuela and his partner, and also the three \"sterile\" machine guns. He then drove rapidly to the Chilean seaside town of Vina del Mar and hurled the guns into the ocean. His accomplice in this action, CIA station chief Henry Hecksher, had assured Washington only days before that either Viaux or Valenzuela would be able to eliminate Schneider and thereby trigger a coup. </p> <p>3. Look again at the White House/ Kissinger memo of October 15, and at the doggedly literal way it is retransmitted to Chile. In no sense of the term does it \"turn off\" Viaux. If anything, it incites him - a well-known and boastful fanatic - to redouble his efforts. \"Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you together with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" This is not exactly the language of standing him down. The remainder of the memo speaks plainly of the intention to \"discourage him from acting alone\", to \"continue to encourage him to amplify his planning\"and to \"encourage him to join forces with other coup planners so that they may act in concert either before or after 24 October. The last three stipulations are an entirely accurate, not to say prescient, description of what Viaux actually did.</p> <p>4. Consult again the cable received by Henry Hecksher on October 20, referring to anxious queries \"from high levels\" about the first of the failed attacks on Schneider. Thomas Karamessines, when questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee about this cable, testified of his certainty that the words \"high levels\" referred directly to Kissinger. In all previous communications from Washington, as a glance above will show, that had indeed been the case. This on its own is enough to demolish Kissinger's claim to have \"turned off\" Track Two (and its interior tracks) on October 15.</p> <p>5. Ambassador Korry later made the obvious point that Kissinger was attempting to build a paper alibi in the event of a failure by the Viaux group. \"His interest was not in Chile but in who was going to be blamed for what. He wanted me to be the one who took the heat. Henry didn't want to be associated with a failure and he was setting up a record to blame the State Department. He brought me in to the President because he wanted me to say what I had to say about Viaux; he wanted me to be the soft man.\"</p> <p>The concept of \"deniability\" was not as well understood in Washington in 1970 as it has since become. But it is clear that Henry Kissinger wanted two things simultaneously. He wanted the removal of General Schneider, by any means and employing any proxy. (No instruction from Washington to leave Schneider unharmed was ever given; deadly weapons were sent by diplomatic pouch, and men of violence were carefully selected to receive them.) And he wanted to be out of the picture in case such an attempt might fail, or be uncovered. These are the normal motives of anyone who solicits or suborns murder. </p> <p>However, Kissinger needed the crime very slightly more than he needed, or was able to design, the deniability. Without waiting for his many hidden papers to be released or subpoenaed, we can say with safety that he is prima facie guilty of direct collusion in the murder of a democratic officer in a democratic and peaceful country</p> <p> OPERATION CONDOR</p> <p>This was a machinery of cross-border assassination, abduction, torture and intimidation, coordinated between the secret police forces of Pinochet's Chile, Stroessner's Paraguay, Videla's Argentina and other regional caudillos. It is now known to have been responsible, to name only the most salient victims, for the murder of the dissident general Carlos Prats of Chile (and his wife) in Buenos Aires, the murder of the Bolivian general Juan Jose Torres, and the maiming of a Chilean Christian Democrat senator, Bernardo Leighton, in Italy. US government complicity has been uncovered at every level of this network. It has been established, for example, that the FBI aided Pinochet in capturing Jorge Isaac Fuentes de Alarcon, who was detained and tortured in Paraguay, then turned over to the Chilean secret police, and 'disappeared'. Astonishingly, the surveillance of Latin US dissident refugees in the United States was promised to Condor figures by US intelligence. </p> <p>These and other facts have been established by the work of 'truth and reconciliation' commissions set up by post-dictatorship forces in the countries of the southern hemisphere. Stroessner has been overthrown, Videla is in prison, Pinochet and his henchmen are being, or have been, brought to account in Chile. The US has not so far found it convenient to establish such a commission of its own.</p> <p>All of the above-cited crimes, and many more besides, were committed on Kissinger's 'watch' as secretary of state. And all of them were, and are, punishable, under local or international law, or both. It can hardly be argued, by himself or by his defenders, that he was indifferent to, or unaware of, the true situation. In 1999, a secret memorandum was declassified, giving excruciating details of a private conversation between Kissinger and Pinochet in Santiago, Chile, on June 8, 1976. The meeting took place the day before Kissinger was due to address the Organisation of American States (OAS). The subject was human rights. Kissinger was at pains to explain to Pinochet that the remarks he was to make on that topic were by no means to be taken seriously. My friend Peter Kornbluh has performed the service of comparing the 'Memcon' (Memorandum of Conversation) with the account of the meeting given by Kissinger himself in his third volume of apologia, Years Of Renewal:</p> <p><strong>The Memoir</strong> 'A considerable amount of time in my dialogue with Pinochet was devoted to human rights, which were, in fact, the principal obstacle to close United States relations with Chile. I outlined the main points in my speech to the OAS which I would deliver the next day. Pinochet made no comment.' </p> <p><strong>The Memcon</strong> 'I will treat human rights in general terms, and human rights in a world context. I will refer in two paragraphs to the report on Chile of the OAS Human Rights Commission. I will say that the human rights issue has impaired relations between the US and Chile. This is partly the result of Congressional actions. I will add that I hope you will shortly remove these obstacles . . . I can do no less, without producing a reaction in the US which would lead to legislative restrictions. The speech is not aimed at Chile. I wanted to tell you about this. My evaluation is that you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government that was going Communist.'</p> <p><strong>The Memoir</strong> 'As Secretary of State, I felt I had the responsibility to encourage the Chilean government in the direction of greater democracy through a policy of understanding Pinochet's concerns . . . Pinochet reminded me that \"Russia supports their people 100 per cent. We are behind you. You are the leader. But you have a punitive system for your friends.\" I returned to my underlying theme that any major help from us would realistically depend on progress on human rights.'</p> <p><strong>The Memcon</strong> 'There is merit in what you say. It is a curious time in the US . . . It is unfortunate. We have been through Vietnam and Watergate. We have to wait until the [1976] elections. We welcomed the overthrow of the Communist-inclined government. We are not out to weaken your position.'</p> <p>In an unpleasant way, Pinochet twice mentioned the name of Orlando Letelier, the exiled Chilean opposition leader, accusing him of misleading the US Congress. Kissinger's response was to apologise for the Congress and to suggest that the dictator should hope for better days after the upcoming elections. Three months later, a car bomb in Washington killed Letelier; it is the only such outrage ever committed in the nation's capital by agents of a foreign regime. The man responsible, the Chilean secret policeman General Manuel Contreras, has since testified at trial that he took no action without personal orders from Pinochet.</p> <p>In advising a murderer and despot to disregard his upcoming remarks as a sop to Congress, Kissinger insulted democracy in both countries. And, in the light of the return to democracy in Chile, and the decision of the Chilean courts to pursue truth and justice, it maligns a dignified and humane people, who have suffered much more than verbal insult at his hands.</p> <p> This is an edited extract from The Trial Of Henry Kissinger, by Christopher Hitchens, to be published by Verso, priced \u00a315, on April 30.

Request headquarters agreement by 1500 hours local time 18 Oct on decision delivery of tear gas to [cooptee] vice [false flag officer]. 6. Request prompt shipment three sterile 45 calibre machine guns and ammo per para 1 above, by special courier if necessary. Please confirm by 2000 hours local time 18 Oct that this can be done so [cooptee] may inform his contacts accordingly. The reply, which is headed \"Immediate Santiago (Eyes Only [Deleted])\" is dated October 18 and reads: Sub-machine guns and ammo being sent by regular [deleted] courier leaving Washington 0700 hours 19 October due arrive Santiago late evening 20 October or early morning 21 October. Preferred use regular [deleted] courier to avoid bringing undue attention to op. A companion message, also addressed to \"Santiago 562\", went like this: 1. Depending how [cooptee] conversation goes evening 18 October you may wish submit Intel report [deleted] so we can decide whether should be dissemed. 2. New subject. If [cooptee] plans lead coup, or be actively and publicly involved, we puzzled why it should bother him if machine guns can be traced to him. Can we develop rationale on why guns must be sterile? Will continue make effort provide them but find our credulity stretched by Navy [officer] leading his troops with sterile guns? What is special purpose for these guns? We will try send them whether you can provide explanation or not. The full beauty of this cable traffic cannot be fully appreciated without a reading of another message, dated October 16. (It should, however, be borne in mind that the Chilean Congress was to meet to confirm Dr Salvador Allende as president on the 24th of that month.) 1. [Deleted/handwritten code name Trickturn] policy, objectives and actions were reviewed at high USG [United States Government] level afternoon 15 October. Conclusions, which are to be your operational guide, follow: 2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup. It would be much preferable to have this transpire prior to 24 October but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously beyond this date. We are to continue to generate maximum pressure toward this end utilizing every appropriate resource. It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG and American hand be well hidden. [italics added] While this imposes on us a high degree of selectivity in making military contacts and dictates that these contacts be made in the most secure manner it definitely does not preclude contacts such as reported in Santiago 544 which was a masterful piece of work. 3. After the most careful consideration it was determined that a Viaux coup attempt carried out by him alone with the forces now at his disposal would fail. Thus, it would be counterproductive to our [deleted; handwritten insert \"Track Two\"] objectives. It was decided that [deleted; handwritten insert \"CIA\"] get a message to Viaux warning him against precipitate action. In essence our message is to state, \"We have reviewed your plans, and based on your information and ours, we come to the conclusion that your plans for a coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may reduce your capabilities for the future. Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you together with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" You are requested to deliver the message to Viaux essentially as noted above. Our objectives are as follows: (A) To advise him of our opinion and discourage him from acting alone; (B) Continue to encourage him to amplify his planning; (C) Encourage him to join forces with other coup planners so that they may act in concert either before or after 24 October. (N.B. Six gas masks and six CS cannisters [sic] are being carried to Santiago by special [deleted] courier ETD Washington 1100 hours 16 October.) 4. There is great and continuing interest in the activities of Tirado, Canales, Valenzuela et al and we wish them maximum good fortune. 5. The above is your operating guidance. No other policy guidance you may receive from [indecipherable: State?] or its maximum exponent in Santiago, on his return, are to sway you from your course. 6. Please review all your present and possibly new activities to include propaganda, black operations, surfacing of intelligence or disinformation, personal contacts, or anything else your imagination can conjure which will permit you to press forward our [deleted] objective in a secure manner. Finally, it is essential to read the White House \"memorandum of conversation\", dated October 15, 1970, to which the above cable directly refers and of which it is a more honest summary. Present for the \"high USG level\" meeting were, as noted in the heading: \"Dr Kissinger, Mr Karamessines, Gen Haig.\" The first paragraph of their deliberations has been entirely blacked out, with not so much as a scribble in the margin from the redaction service. (Given what has since been admitted, this 20-line deletion must be well worth reading.) Picking up at paragraph two, we find the following: 2. Then Mr Karamessines provided a run-down on Viaux, the Canales meeting with Tirado, the latter's new position [after Porta was relieved of command \"for health reasons\"] and, in some detail, the general situation in Chile from the coup possibility viewpoint. 3. A certain amount of information was available to us concerning Viaux's alleged support throughout the Chilean military. We had assessed Viaux's claims carefully, basing our analysis on good intelligence from a number of sources. Our conclusion was clear: Viaux did not have more than one chance in 20 - perhaps less - to launch a successful coup. 4. The unfortunate repercussions, in Chile and internationally, of an unsuccessful coup were discussed. Dr Kissinger ticked off his list of these negative possibilities. His items were remarkably similar to the ones Mr Karamessines had prepared. 5. It was decided by those present that the Agency must get a message to Viaux warning him against any precipitate action. In essence our message was to state: \"We have reviewed your plans, and based on your information and ours, we come to the conclusion that your plans for a coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may reduce your capabilities for the future. Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" 6. After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux coup plot, at least temporarily, Dr Kissinger instructed Mr Karamessines to preserve Agency assets in Chile, working clandestinely and securely to maintain the capability for Agency operations against Allende in the future. 7. Dr Kissinger discussed his desire that the word of our encouragement to the Chilean military in recent weeks be kept as secret as possible. Mr Karamessines stated emphatically that we had been doing everything possible in this connection, including the use of false flag officers, car meetings and every conceivable precaution. But we and others had done a great deal of talking recently with a number of persons. For example, Ambassador Korry's wideranging discussions with numerous people urging a coup \"cannot be put back into the bottle.\" [Three lines of deletion follow.] [Dr Kissinger requested that copy of the message be sent to him on 16 October.] The meeting concluded on Dr Kissinger's note that the Agency should continue keeping the pressure on every Allende weak spot in sight: now, after October 24, after November 5, and into the future until such time as new marching orders are given. Mr Karamessines stated that the Agency would comply. So Track Two contained two tracks of its own. Track Two/One was the group of ultras led by General Viaux and his sidekick Captain Arturo Marshal. These men had tried to bring off a coup in 1969 against the Christian Democrats; they had been cashiered and were disliked even by conservatives in the officer corps. \"Track Two/Two\" was a more ostensibly \"respectable\" faction headed by General Camilo Valenzuela, the chief of the garrison in the capital city, whose name occurs in the cables above and whose identity is concealed by some of the deletions. Several of the CIA operatives in Chile felt that Viaux was too much of a mad-dog to be trusted. And Ambassador Korry's repeated admonitions also had their effect. As shown in the October 15 memo cited above, Kissinger and Karamessines developed last-minute second thoughts about Viaux, who as late as October 13 had been given $20,000 in cash from the CIA station and promised a life insurance policy of $250,000. This offer was authorised direct from the White House. However, with only days to go before Allende was inaugurated, and with Nixon repeating that \"it was absolutely essential that the election of Mr Allende to the Presidency be thwarted\", the pressure on the Valenzuela group became intense. As a direct consequence, especially after the warm words of encouragement he had been given, General Viaux felt himself under some obligation to deliver also, and to disprove those who had doubted him. On the evening of October 19, 1970, the Valenzuela group, aided by some of Viaux's gang, and equipped with the tear gas grenades delivered by the CIA, attempted to grab General Schneider as he left an official dinner. The attempt failed because he left in a private car and not the expected official vehicle. The failure produced an extremely significant cable from CIA headquarters in Washington to the local station, asking for urgent action because \"Headquarters must respond during morning 20 October to queries from high levels.\" Payments of $50,000 each to General Viaux and his chief associate were then authorised on the condition that they made another attempt. On the evening of October 20, they did. But again there was only failure to report. On October 22, the \"sterile\" machine guns above-mentioned were handed to Valenzuela's group for another try. Later that same day, General Viaux's gang finally murdered General Schneider. According to the later verdict of the Chilean military courts, this atrocity partook of elements of both tracks of Track Two. In other words, Valenzuela was not himself on the scene but the assassination squad, led by Viaux, contained men who had participated in the preceding two attempts. Viaux was convicted on charges of kidnapping and of conspiring to cause a coup. Valenzuela was convicted of the charge of conspiracy to cause a coup. So any subsequent attempt to distinguish the two plots from each other, except in point of degree, is an attempt to confect a distinction without a difference. It scarcely matters whether Schneider was slain because of a kidnapping scheme that went awry (he was said, but only by the assassins, to have had the temerity to resist) or whether his assassination was the objective in the first place. The Chilean military police report, as it happens, describes a straightforward murder. Under the law of every law-bound country (including the United States), a crime committed in the pursuit of a kidnapping is thereby aggravated, not mitigated. You may not say, with a corpse at your feet, \"I was only trying to kidnap him.\" At least, you may not say so if you hope to plead extenuating circumstances. Yet a version of \"extenuating circumstances\" has become the paper-thin cover story with which Kissinger has since protected himself from the charge of being an accomplice, before and after the fact, in kidnap and murder. And this sorry cover story has even found a refuge in the written record. The Senate Intelligence Committee, in its investigation of the matter, concluded that since the machine guns supplied to Valenzuela had not actually been employed in the killing, and since General Viaux had been officially discouraged by the CIA a few days before the murder, there was therefore \"no evidence of a plan to kill Schneider or that United States officials specifically anticipated that Schneider would be shot during the abduction\". Walter Isaacson, one of Kissinger's biographers, takes at face value a memo from Kissinger to Nixon after his meeting on October 15 with Karamessines, in which he reports to the president that he had \"turned off\" the Viaux plot. He also takes at face value the claim that Viaux's successful hit was essentially unauthorised. These excuses and apologies are as logically feeble as they are morally contemptible. Henry Kissinger bears direct responsibility for the Schneider murder, as the following points demonstrate. 1. Brian MacMaster, one of the \"false flag\" agents mentioned in the cable traffic above, a career CIA man carrying a forged Colombian passport and claiming to represent American business interests in Chile, has told of his efforts to get \"hush money\" to jailed members of the Viaux group, after the assassination and before they could implicate the Agency. 2. Colonel Paul M Wimert, a military attache in Santiago and chief CIA liaison officer with the Valenzuela faction, has testified that after the Schneider killing he hastily retrieved the two payments of $50,000 that had been paid to Valenzuela and his partner, and also the three \"sterile\" machine guns. He then drove rapidly to the Chilean seaside town of Vina del Mar and hurled the guns into the ocean. His accomplice in this action, CIA station chief Henry Hecksher, had assured Washington only days before that either Viaux or Valenzuela would be able to eliminate Schneider and thereby trigger a coup. 3. Look again at the White House/ Kissinger memo of October 15, and at the doggedly literal way it is retransmitted to Chile. In no sense of the term does it \"turn off\" Viaux. If anything, it incites him - a well-known and boastful fanatic - to redouble his efforts. \"Preserve your assets. We will stay in touch. The time will come when you together with all your other friends can do something. You will continue to have our support.\" This is not exactly the language of standing him down. The remainder of the memo speaks plainly of the intention to \"discourage him from acting alone\", to \"continue to encourage him to amplify his planning\"and to \"encourage him to join forces with other coup planners so that they may act in concert either before or after 24 October. The last three stipulations are an entirely accurate, not to say prescient, description of what Viaux actually did. 4. Consult again the cable received by Henry Hecksher on October 20, referring to anxious queries \"from high levels\" about the first of the failed attacks on Schneider. Thomas Karamessines, when questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee about this cable, testified of his certainty that the words \"high levels\" referred directly to Kissinger. In all previous communications from Washington, as a glance above will show, that had indeed been the case. This on its own is enough to demolish Kissinger's claim to have \"turned off\" Track Two (and its interior tracks) on October 15. 5. Ambassador Korry later made the obvious point that Kissinger was attempting to build a paper alibi in the event of a failure by the Viaux group. \"His interest was not in Chile but in who was going to be blamed for what. He wanted me to be the one who took the heat. Henry didn't want to be associated with a failure and he was setting up a record to blame the State Department. He brought me in to the President because he wanted me to say what I had to say about Viaux; he wanted me to be the soft man.\" The concept of \"deniability\" was not as well understood in Washington in 1970 as it has since become. But it is clear that Henry Kissinger wanted two things simultaneously. He wanted the removal of General Schneider, by any means and employing any proxy. (No instruction from Washington to leave Schneider unharmed was ever given; deadly weapons were sent by diplomatic pouch, and men of violence were carefully selected to receive them.) And he wanted to be out of the picture in case such an attempt might fail, or be uncovered. These are the normal motives of anyone who solicits or suborns murder. However, Kissinger needed the crime very slightly more than he needed, or was able to design, the deniability. Without waiting for his many hidden papers to be released or subpoenaed, we can say with safety that he is prima facie guilty of direct collusion in the murder of a democratic officer in a democratic and peaceful country OPERATION CONDOR This was a machinery of cross-border assassination, abduction, torture and intimidation, coordinated between the secret police forces of Pinochet's Chile, Stroessner's Paraguay, Videla's Argentina and other regional caudillos. It is now known to have been responsible, to name only the most salient victims, for the murder of the dissident general Carlos Prats of Chile (and his wife) in Buenos Aires, the murder of the Bolivian general Juan Jose Torres, and the maiming of a Chilean Christian Democrat senator, Bernardo Leighton, in Italy. US government complicity has been uncovered at every level of this network. It has been established, for example, that the FBI aided Pinochet in capturing Jorge Isaac Fuentes de Alarcon, who was detained and tortured in Paraguay, then turned over to the Chilean secret police, and 'disappeared'. Astonishingly, the surveillance of Latin US dissident refugees in the United States was promised to Condor figures by US intelligence. These and other facts have been established by the work of 'truth and reconciliation' commissions set up by post-dictatorship forces in the countries of the southern hemisphere. Stroessner has been overthrown, Videla is in prison, Pinochet and his henchmen are being, or have been, brought to account in Chile. The US has not so far found it convenient to establish such a commission of its own. All of the above-cited crimes, and many more besides, were committed on Kissinger's 'watch' as secretary of state. And all of them were, and are, punishable, under local or international law, or both. It can hardly be argued, by himself or by his defenders, that he was indifferent to, or unaware of, the true situation. In 1999, a secret memorandum was declassified, giving excruciating details of a private conversation between Kissinger and Pinochet in Santiago, Chile, on June 8, 1976. The meeting took place the day before Kissinger was due to address the Organisation of American States (OAS). The subject was human rights. Kissinger was at pains to explain to Pinochet that the remarks he was to make on that topic were by no means to be taken seriously. My friend Peter Kornbluh has performed the service of comparing the 'Memcon' (Memorandum of Conversation) with the account of the meeting given by Kissinger himself in his third volume of apologia, Years Of Renewal: The Memoir 'A considerable amount of time in my dialogue with Pinochet was devoted to human rights, which were, in fact, the principal obstacle to close United States relations with Chile. I outlined the main points in my speech to the OAS which I would deliver the next day. Pinochet made no comment.' The Memcon 'I will treat human rights in general terms, and human rights in a world context. I will refer in two paragraphs to the report on Chile of the OAS Human Rights Commission. I will say that the human rights issue has impaired relations between the US and Chile. This is partly the result of Congressional actions. I will add that I hope you will shortly remove these obstacles . . . I can do no less, without producing a reaction in the US which would lead to legislative restrictions. The speech is not aimed at Chile. I wanted to tell you about this. My evaluation is that you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government that was going Communist.' The Memoir 'As Secretary of State, I felt I had the responsibility to encourage the Chilean government in the direction of greater democracy through a policy of understanding Pinochet's concerns . . . Pinochet reminded me that \"Russia supports their people 100 per cent. We are behind you. You are the leader. But you have a punitive system for your friends.\" I returned to my underlying theme that any major help from us would realistically depend on progress on human rights.' The Memcon 'There is merit in what you say. It is a curious time in the US . . . It is unfortunate. We have been through Vietnam and Watergate. We have to wait until the [1976] elections. We welcomed the overthrow of the Communist-inclined government. We are not out to weaken your position.' In an unpleasant way, Pinochet twice mentioned the name of Orlando Letelier, the exiled Chilean opposition leader, accusing him of misleading the US Congress. Kissinger's response was to apologise for the Congress and to suggest that the dictator should hope for better days after the upcoming elections. Three months later, a car bomb in Washington killed Letelier; it is the only such outrage ever committed in the nation's capital by agents of a foreign regime. The man responsible, the Chilean secret policeman General Manuel Contreras, has since testified at trial that he took no action without personal orders from Pinochet. In advising a murderer and despot to disregard his upcoming remarks as a sop to Congress, Kissinger insulted democracy in both countries. And, in the light of the return to democracy in Chile, and the decision of the Chilean courts to pursue truth and justice, it maligns a dignified and humane people, who have suffered much more than verbal insult at his hands.

When I moaned to a Tory MP on the trade and industry select committee about my difficulty in pinning down the nature of Grylls's corruption, the MP snorted: \"Everyone knows Mickey Grylls is making \u00a325-35,000 a year.\"</p> <p>A former employee of Ian Greer, who resigned in disgust at the Grylls-Greer collusion, explained how it worked. Whenever businessmen approached Grylls for help - even from his own constituency - he made it a condition that they hire Greer's firm to lobby for them. For this, Grylls received a percentage of Greer's contracts, probably 10%.</p> <p>When the then Conservative transport secretary, Nicholas Ridley, tried to divert \u00a320m of international routes from British Airways to what was then British Caledonian - in order to sustain that troubled airline - its existing lobbyist, Shandwick, advised BA to approach MPs. When an unhappy top BA executive approached Grylls, he persuaded them to switch their lobbying contract to Greer. Greer's success in organising a BA fan club among MPs was so successful that Ridley was defeated in cabinet. The continuing BA contract contributed to Greer's peak total of \u00a33m in contracts and Gryll's hefty percentage.</p> <p>A Central Television team attempted a documentary in 1994 in which they pretended to be Russo-American entrepreneurs, ready to spend $40m on buying decanted government agencies, particularly the insolvency agency. A fancy office with concealed cameras was set up in Park Lane, with a black American actor pretending to be gay, to attract Greer. Grylls was approached and he referred them to Greer. Greer boasted about what he could do for these potential clients. He also boasted about his close connections with the then prime minister, John Major. The documentary was never broadcast, but verbatim extracts appeared in the Guardian.</p> <p>When I met Grylls to agree final versions of his entry in my Parliamentary Profiles, he always attempted to avoid any hint of impropriety. He tried unsuccessfully to avoid references to his having been found guilty of evading exchange controls in connection with his Spanish wine importing business. He tried to change my disclosure of his link with Greer to one of \"friendship\". But, in 1994, he let through my reference to his taking a percentage for referring business to Greer.</p> <p>When this was published, Grylls told newsmen he was suing me for libel. Instead, his lawyers told him to put his connection with Greer belatedly into the register of members' interests. He did this so quietly that, a few days later, the Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours persuaded the Conservative majority of the register's controlling committee to investigate my \"scurrilous\" allegations to \"clear\" Grylls's name.</p> <p>That was the beginning of the end. First, the committee discovered more about the Greer-Grylls connection. Later, when Greer and Neil Hamilton sued the Guardian for \u00a32m, with the backing of the Conservative party and John Major, Greer's changes in accounting after I published the Grylls-Greer connection, enabled the Guardian's lawyers to unravel all Greer's payments to MPs in the discovery process of libel actions.</p> <p>In March 1997 - by which time Grylls had decided to retire from politics - the initial disclosures of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Sir Gordon Downey, found Greer admitting to having lied about Grylls's payments. There had been six or seven payments, not three. He later disclosed that he paid Grylls \u00a310,000 pounds annually, plus a percentage of the contracts Grylls had secured for him.</p> <p>Grylls invested wisely. In 1994, he became chairman of a biotechnology company, Electrophoretics, holding 300,000 shares and options on a further 211,000. By October 1995, they were worth \u00a3650,000 with the help of a government contract to develop a quick diagnostic test for BSE.</p> <p>His strange career had initially seemed destined for military achievement. Born in Folkestone, the son of a brigadier, Grylls was educated at St Ronan's preparatory school, Hawkhurst, and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and served in the Royal Marines (1952-55). After language studies in Madrid, at 22 he imported Spanish wines, as chairman and managing director of the Costa Brava Wine Company, of which he owned 40%. He achieved notoriety by importing sparkling white wine as Spanish champagne - to the intense hostility of the French exporters of genuine champagne. Acquitted of false trading, he was later found guilty of \"passing off\".</p> <p>Grylls was elected to St Pancras borough council at the age of 25 in 1959, and to the Greater London Council in 1967, becoming deputy chairman of the Inner London Education Authority in 1969. He lost to Labour's Michael Stewart in Fulham in 1964 and 1966, but entered the Commons in 1970 for safe, suburban Chertsey, later redrawn as NW Surrey.</p> <p>He proclaimed himself a rightwinger anxious to liberate business, but showed opportunistic deviations from the beginning in urging public funding for British Aerospace to build a new airliner, knowing it would be built by his constituents in BAe's Weybridge plant.</p> <p>From 1971, he urged British membership of the EEC, and his pro-European attitude led him to back Michael Heseltine against Mrs Thatcher in 1986 in favouring a European consortium to help Westland Helicopters out of its crisis. He was one of the few right-wingers who never voted against the Major government on Maastricht.</p> <p>A spokesman for the pharmaceutical industry, Grylls urged a ban on BBC broadcasts causing alarm about the side-effects of drugs. By 1979-80, he was chairman both of the Tories' small business bureau and their trade and industry committee. He sought immunity from redundancy payments for small businesses. He attacked the capital transfer tax as interfering with family control of businesses. He opposed the indexing of unemployment benefit.</p> <p>His social views were mixed. A stern opponent of smoking, he introduced a bill to curb abortion \"vultures\" by licensing referral agencies, and, in later years, he broadened his support for capital punishment. He backed the South African apartheid regime and supported the US intervention in Grenada.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Sally, and a daughter and son.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir William Michael John Grylls, politician and businessman, born February 21 1934; died February 7 2001.</p>",

When I met Grylls to agree final versions of his entry in my Parliamentary Profiles, he always attempted to avoid any hint of impropriety. He tried unsuccessfully to avoid references to his having been found guilty of evading exchange controls in connection with his Spanish wine importing business. He tried to change my disclosure of his link with Greer to one of \"friendship\". But, in 1994, he let through my reference to his taking a percentage for referring business to Greer. When this was published, Grylls told newsmen he was suing me for libel. Instead, his lawyers told him to put his connection with Greer belatedly into the register of members' interests. He did this so quietly that, a few days later, the Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours persuaded the Conservative majority of the register's controlling committee to investigate my \"scurrilous\" allegations to \"clear\" Grylls's name. That was the beginning of the end. First, the committee discovered more about the Greer-Grylls connection. Later, when Greer and Neil Hamilton sued the Guardian for \u00a32m, with the backing of the Conservative party and John Major, Greer's changes in accounting after I published the Grylls-Greer connection, enabled the Guardian's lawyers to unravel all Greer's payments to MPs in the discovery process of libel actions. In March 1997 - by which time Grylls had decided to retire from politics - the initial disclosures of the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Sir Gordon Downey, found Greer admitting to having lied about Grylls's payments. There had been six or seven payments, not three. He later disclosed that he paid Grylls \u00a310,000 pounds annually, plus a percentage of the contracts Grylls had secured for him. Grylls invested wisely. In 1994, he became chairman of a biotechnology company, Electrophoretics, holding 300,000 shares and options on a further 211,000. By October 1995, they were worth \u00a3650,000 with the help of a government contract to develop a quick diagnostic test for BSE. His strange career had initially seemed destined for military achievement. Born in Folkestone, the son of a brigadier, Grylls was educated at St Ronan's preparatory school, Hawkhurst, and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and served in the Royal Marines (1952-55). After language studies in Madrid, at 22 he imported Spanish wines, as chairman and managing director of the Costa Brava Wine Company, of which he owned 40%. He achieved notoriety by importing sparkling white wine as Spanish champagne - to the intense hostility of the French exporters of genuine champagne. Acquitted of false trading, he was later found guilty of \"passing off\". Grylls was elected to St Pancras borough council at the age of 25 in 1959, and to the Greater London Council in 1967, becoming deputy chairman of the Inner London Education Authority in 1969. He lost to Labour's Michael Stewart in Fulham in 1964 and 1966, but entered the Commons in 1970 for safe, suburban Chertsey, later redrawn as NW Surrey. He proclaimed himself a rightwinger anxious to liberate business, but showed opportunistic deviations from the beginning in urging public funding for British Aerospace to build a new airliner, knowing it would be built by his constituents in BAe's Weybridge plant. From 1971, he urged British membership of the EEC, and his pro-European attitude led him to back Michael Heseltine against Mrs Thatcher in 1986 in favouring a European consortium to help Westland Helicopters out of its crisis. He was one of the few right-wingers who never voted against the Major government on Maastricht. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical industry, Grylls urged a ban on BBC broadcasts causing alarm about the side-effects of drugs. By 1979-80, he was chairman both of the Tories' small business bureau and their trade and industry committee. He sought immunity from redundancy payments for small businesses. He attacked the capital transfer tax as interfering with family control of businesses. He opposed the indexing of unemployment benefit. His social views were mixed. A stern opponent of smoking, he introduced a bill to curb abortion \"vultures\" by licensing referral agencies, and, in later years, he broadened his support for capital punishment. He backed the South African apartheid regime and supported the US intervention in Grenada. He is survived by his wife, Sally, and a daughter and son. \u0095 Sir William Michael John Grylls, politician and businessman, born February 21 1934; died February 7 2001.",

      "bodyText": "A violent Japanese film linked to copycat crimes committed by teenagers is to be released in Britain this autumn. Battle Royale, directed by the veteran Japanese gangster movie director Kinji Fukasaku, contains graphic depictions of extreme violence committed by teenagers and has been blamed for a number of crimes. The film, described as a cross between A Clockwork Orange and Lord of the Flies, is set in the near future when the Japanese government - despairing of a wave of teen lawlessness - decides to make an example of the nation's worst-behaved class. The uniform-clad teenagers are placed on a remote jungle island, heavily armed, and told that only the last one alive will be allowed home. They are also made to wear a collar that explodes if they refuse. Mayhem follows as the characters, under the cold eye of their teacher, form gangs to slaughter their former friends before they turn on one another. In one scene, a student stuffs a bomb into the severed head of one of his classmates and lobs it into a room where three others are hiding. In another scene, a girl slices through the neck of a classmate with a sickle while the victim begs for mercy. Tens of thousands of Japanese youths queued for up to two days to get tickets for its opening on December 16. In the run-up to the launch, the education minister Nobutaka Machimura begged Japan's film censors to ban the film and urged cinemas not to show it. The government has even considered introducing a bill to strengthen its lax powers of censorship. However, Japan's film classification board simply confirmed its decision to restrict Battle Royale to audiences aged 16 and over. Within hours of its opening, a 17-year-old boy went on the rampage in Tokyo with a baseball bat, attacking people at random and hospitalising a 68-year-old woman. It is not certain whether he had seen the film, but its critics pointed to the incident as proof that the general atmosphere in which violence is glorified leads to more violence. The film does not have a US release date because it is unlikely any distributor there would touch it, but the British company Metro-Tartan will be releasing it in the UK around October.

      "bodyText": "Fears that mounting violence between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Yugoslavian forces could destabilise the region dominated the summit of Balkan leaders and European Union officials yesterday in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia. The violence in and around the three-mile-wide buffer zone between Kosovo and southern Serbia, which includes the three largely ethnic Albanian towns of Presevo, Bujanovac, and Medvedja, also led to EU warnings that aid could dry up if it does not stop. The EU external affairs commissioner, Chris Patten, issued a sharp warning: \"The people of Kosovo need a wake-up call because it is the whole of Kosovo that risks paying - literally and figuratively - if this barbarism carries on.\" A dozen Serbian soldiers and police have been killed by mines or sniper fire in the last month, while Yugoslav tanks have shelled ethnic Albanian villages as up to 2,000 guerrillas roam the countryside and man roadblocks. Within Kosovo itself, 10 Serb civilians died last week when the leading bus in a convoy hit a landmine. Unlike the celebratory mood of the last summit four months ago, yesterday's meeting of leaders from Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Yugoslavia, plus a delegate from Croatia, was a gloomy affair. Albanian gunmen have also targeted police in nearby western Macedonia in incidents which EU officials fear may be connected. \"The introduction of weaponry in Macedonia has come very suddenly, and there is a considerable degree of organisation among the Albanians but we are not sure of the purpose,\" a senior western diplomat said. The new government in Belgrade has proposed a plan for peace talks which would pump aid into the region. The plan stops short of autonomy and calls for the guerrillas to disband before Yugoslav forces withdraw. Western governments are wary of endorsing the plan, fearing that if talks breakdown they will be asked to support military action. The Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, told yesterday's summit that the buffer zone should be abolished. \"It is no longer a security zone, but merely a base for terrorist activity and the major source of the threat,\" Mr Kostunica said.",

I know that the great man owns the leasehold, and presumably pays the salaries and bills, but it's slightly unfair on a seriously talented young chef, Robert Reid, that the long shadow of the former incumbent of the kitchen should fall quite so heavily across the progress of the new. As we all know, Marco gave up cooking last year to devote himself full time to empire building and to fulfil the quote of Salvador Dal\u00ed that is still reproduced on the menu: \"At six I wanted to be a chef, at seven Napoleon, and my ambitions have been growing ever since.\" </p> <p>The Oak Room is a dining room of hallowed memory for me. I have reviewed it twice before, when different chefs were using it as a showcase for their talents. Each time, I have loved its Edwardian grandiosity, the scrolled, bleached, oak panelling, the soaring ceilings, the curlicues of the Venetian glass chandeliers that are the size of a cruise ship's propellers, the plush and the hush and the inherent drama of it all. This is not a restaurant where design takes precedence over substance, where the distractions of fashion rule over the realities of luxury. It is grand, and you know that it's going to be expensive, although now the bill won't hit the heart-stopping heights of MPW's day, unless you get stuck into the wine list in a serious way. There's a three-course lunch menu at \u00a327.50, which represents pretty good value. Or you can eat three courses \u00e0 la carte for \u00a338. And then there's a menu gourmand, a snip at \u00a348. </p> <p>Sigurd and I passed on the gourmand line-up, stuffed, as it was, with MPW classics. We were in search of the real Robert Reid, which is not as easy as it should be. There seems far too much of MPW all over this menu, and not nearly enough RR, which seems a pity, as RR is more than able to compose his own twinkling dishes. I was first alerted to this fact some months back by a fabulously good dish of rabbit in its own jelly and loads of baby veg that managed to roll out the flavour of the rabbit without killing the flavour of the vegetables (not always an easy thing). It was a dish of a sophisticatedly sunny aspect, something you can't carry off without care, thought and talent. </p> <p>For this lunch, I decided on a panach\u00e9 of langoustines and pork belly with a pur\u00e9e of celeriac and a sauce made from the langoustines, grilled sea bass with fennel and beurre noisette, and le flottante with custard. Sigurd was taken by caramelised scallops and calamari with sauce nero from the daily menu, then tranche of salt cod with smoked salmon and sauce \"Reputation\", whatever that might be, and finally the toothsome quiddities of tarte Tatin of pears, a longtime MPW classic, the virtues of which need no extolling here. Actually, the same could be said of the le flottante, which looked as if part of the massive iceberg that recently broke off Antarctica had floated into the Oak Room on a sea of custard. </p> <p>Unless I am much mistaken, however, the langoustine and belly pork duo is very much RR, an apparently simple dish made remarkable by the quality of the ingredients and the assurance of the cooking, which produced the intense, superbly spiced langoustine juice to balance the sweet plumpness of the shellfish and the mild richness of the pork, which had been rendered to a succulent crispness. The sea bass wasn't in the same league, partly because the sauce was built to a similar intensity as the preceding dish, with an over-emphasis on tomato and none of the same energetic spicing. </p> <p>Sigurd's expectations of the scallop and calamari dish were rewarded - it was a distillation of marine life, both sweet and salty, dramatic and simple. As for his main dish, we may not see a piece of cod the size and shape of Ayers Rock again, so it's as well that we took a last look upon the marvel of the mature fish and despaired, but there was no need to despair about its treatment - a light salting had tightened the flesh, adding a notch or two more flavour, with the salmon bringing a drift of smokiness, and the sauce washing all with a velvet smoothness. It was, in short, a classy number. </p> <p>The final damage totted up to \u00a3121.50. This included a bottle of rather uninspired Sancerre at \u00a330.30 from a list as rococo as the chandeliers and on which there aren't too many bargains. There was water and coffee, naturally, and these added another \u00a316 (how much!), so the main event came to \u00a376, or \u00a338 a head, roughly half that when MPW manned the stoves. I'd say that the standard of cooking and service showed no such slippage, so on that basis the Oak Room must now be seen to be something of a bargain.</p>",

Girls who are sexy, flirtatious, dangerous, but most of all vampy and dramatic.\" Such were the instructions posted backstage at the Maria Grachvogel show for the girls about to step out on to the catwalk. </p> <p>A tall order to a room full of exhausted models on the last day of London fashion week, perhaps. But it is amazing how quickly one becomes a convincing showbiz diva in a tightly corseted, crystal beaded strapless fishtail dress in feather-appliqued violet devore velvet. </p> <p>The show opened not with a showbiz diva, however, but with a ballerina. In a white crystal-studded tutu and feather headpiece, Sarah McIlroy of the English National Ballet traversed the catwalk en pointe, scattering the catwalk with feathers as she went. </p> <p>Feathers were to be a theme of the show. Grachvogel's forte is her show-stopping eveningwear, adored by the likes of Victoria Beckham, who modelled for the designer last February. True to form, on to the white featherbed catwalk stepped a succession of gowns destined for red carpet occasions. </p> <p>The collection was inspired by the screen glamour of Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. \"They could be very androgynous and sleek, and then the next minute they'd be wearing the most fabulous dresses,\" the designer said. Simple, backless mini dresses of jet black sequins and a black satin plunge-necked \"Marlene\" dress had overtones of tuxedo dressing. Then the collection burst into colour, with a series of hand-painted, hand-appliqued dresses. These will be made individually in the designer's studio, but sold (for a handsome sum) in selected upscale stores. </p> <p>In devore velvet and satin chiffon, featuring corset boning and wispy chiffon skirts, dresses came in pale green overlaid with gold lace, or chartreuse velvet with scarlet feathers at the shoulder. Feather corsages dangled from the models' wrists, while long feathery wisps trailed at the hems. Sipping champagne and striking their sexiest poses for the cameras, the models seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their diva role. </p> <p>\u0095 Alexander McQueen, British fashion designer of the year, has announced that he will not be showing in London next season. </p> <p>McQueen, who has shown in New York in the past, is to expand his business internationally now that he has signed a deal selling 51% of his company to Gucci. London's Conduit Street is currently the only McQueen shop, but there are plans to open stores in all the major fashion capitals. The departure of McQueen, whose show is a highlight of London fashion week, will make a serious dent in the city's fashion profile. </p> <p>In an interview in Women's Wear Daily, McQueen also said that he planned to produce haute couture under his own name once his contract with Givenchy had run its course.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Be showbiz divas! Girls who are sexy, flirtatious, dangerous, but most of all vampy and dramatic.\" Such were the instructions posted backstage at the Maria Grachvogel show for the girls about to step out on to the catwalk. A tall order to a room full of exhausted models on the last day of London fashion week, perhaps. But it is amazing how quickly one becomes a convincing showbiz diva in a tightly corseted, crystal beaded strapless fishtail dress in feather-appliqued violet devore velvet. The show opened not with a showbiz diva, however, but with a ballerina. In a white crystal-studded tutu and feather headpiece, Sarah McIlroy of the English National Ballet traversed the catwalk en pointe, scattering the catwalk with feathers as she went. Feathers were to be a theme of the show. Grachvogel's forte is her show-stopping eveningwear, adored by the likes of Victoria Beckham, who modelled for the designer last February. True to form, on to the white featherbed catwalk stepped a succession of gowns destined for red carpet occasions. The collection was inspired by the screen glamour of Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo. \"They could be very androgynous and sleek, and then the next minute they'd be wearing the most fabulous dresses,\" the designer said. Simple, backless mini dresses of jet black sequins and a black satin plunge-necked \"Marlene\" dress had overtones of tuxedo dressing. Then the collection burst into colour, with a series of hand-painted, hand-appliqued dresses. These will be made individually in the designer's studio, but sold (for a handsome sum) in selected upscale stores. In devore velvet and satin chiffon, featuring corset boning and wispy chiffon skirts, dresses came in pale green overlaid with gold lace, or chartreuse velvet with scarlet feathers at the shoulder. Feather corsages dangled from the models' wrists, while long feathery wisps trailed at the hems. Sipping champagne and striking their sexiest poses for the cameras, the models seemed to be thoroughly enjoying their diva role. \u0095 Alexander McQueen, British fashion designer of the year, has announced that he will not be showing in London next season. McQueen, who has shown in New York in the past, is to expand his business internationally now that he has signed a deal selling 51% of his company to Gucci. London's Conduit Street is currently the only McQueen shop, but there are plans to open stores in all the major fashion capitals. The departure of McQueen, whose show is a highlight of London fashion week, will make a serious dent in the city's fashion profile. In an interview in Women's Wear Daily, McQueen also said that he planned to produce haute couture under his own name once his contract with Givenchy had run its course.",

      "bodyText": "The increase in ethnic minority police officers employed by forces in England and Wales has slowed significantly, a Guardian survey can reveal. The survey, marking today's second anniversary of Sir William Macpherson's report into the police's failings in the Stephen Lawrence case, suggests the pace of progress may be slowing on at least one crucial measure. One of Sir William's main recommendations was a rapid increase in the number of ethnic minority officers employed. The number of ethnic minority officers increased by 155 in the past year, according to the latest figures the 43 forces in England and Wales made available to the Guardian. The previous year the increase was 261, which itself brought into question whether the police could meet targets set by the government - an increase of around 6,000 officers by 2009. The results vary considerably from force to force. The West Midlands constabulary alone was responsible for a quarter of this year's increase. But 13 forces either failed to recruit a single Asian or Afro-Caribbean officer, or saw the numbers fall. The eight forces whose progress went into reverse were Essex, Humberside - whose chief constable chair's a high-powered police race committee, the Metropolitan police, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Northumbria, North Wales and Staffordshire. Eight forces managed an increase of just one officer in the last year. Last year's Guardian survey saw all forces responding, but this year 16 refused or did not answer. The survey questions were based on recommendations by Sir William Macpherson and measures devised by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. Where forces refused to make public their figures, those from their returns to the home office detailing the number of ethnic minority officers as of September 30 2000 were used. A spokesman for the City of London police, which managed to recruit one extra ethnic minority officer in the last year, said: \"The figure is against a background of a decrease in police strength of 150 officers due to recent budgetary cuts.\" The survey also showed that the clear-up rate for racist crimes and incidents varied widely. Of those forces responding, the Met, seen by some as having the greatest expertise, was bottom clearing up just one in four race crimes. Imran Khan, solicitor for the Lawrence family, said the Guardian survey showed too little had changed within the police: \"You can't expect people to join racist police forces.\" Sir Herman Ouseley, former chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, who reviewed the Met's diversity strategy, said: \"The survey results show that the rhetoric that came in the post-Macpherson era has not been delivered upon.

      "body": "<p>\"It canna be true,\" says Osie, the Orkney crofter who appears in David Thomson's memorable book, \"but there was supposed to be a creature in the water for every one on land.\" And a moment later - insisting again, \"This canna be true\" - he tells the author a story about a stranger cow that came up from the sea and installed herself in a byre on the land. \"And she had grand calves. But I forget, now, was it a seal or another cow came years after to the door o' the byre . . . and the cow went away to the sea again.\" And then comes the clinching cadence: \"An old woman told me yon,\" said Osie. \"Well, there was supposed to be cows and sheep and every animal there. But the seals were the people o' the sea.\" </p> <p>In the presence of such alluring inventions and such substantial voice, analysis and appreciation feel superfluous. Talk of the willing suspension of disbelief, of the salubrious effect of imaginative narrative, characterisations of the mental habits of pre-industrial societies, conjectures about how the sociological facts got displaced in earlier days into the parallel universe of the mythological - all such commentary seems to lead in the wrong direction. David Thomson's book is luminously its own thing; it had its origins in one man's rambles round the highlands and islands of Scotland and the west coast of Ireland, in search of stories and folklore surrounding the \"selchie\" or grey Atlantic seal. It was written at a great moment in the history of radio, during the 1940s and 1950s, when the BBC employed poets and writers to record and collect oral material and - most important - gave them permission to re-create it in a new artistic form. Consequently it survives not as a period piece but as a poetic achievement, one of those whose works written by \"a man speaking to men: a man, it is true, endued with more lively sensibility, more enthusiasm and tenderness, who has a greater knowledge of human nature, and a more com prehensive soul, than are supposed to be common among mankind . . .\" </p> <p>William Wordsworth's definition of a poet, which I have just quoted, seems an appropriate characterisation of the man who wrote The People Of The Sea. Indeed, what kept coming to mind as I re-read the book was Wordsworth's poem, The Solitary Reaper. One of the most haunting lyrics in the English language, this too was written after a tour in Scotland and is about the experience of listening to one of the local people express herself unforgettably in her native Gaelic. The sight of women working in the harvest fields must have been a common one at the time, but interestingly enough, the poet found his immediate inspiration in the manuscript of a book by his friend Thomas Wilkinson: \"Passed by a Female who was reaping alone, she sung in Erse as she bended over her sickle, the sweetest human voice I ever heard. Her strains were tenderly melancholy, and felt delicious long after they were heard no more.\" Wordsworth's final stanza uses some of Wilkinson's exact words, but what was notation in the prose becomes incantation in the poem: </p> <p> Whate'er the theme, the Maiden sang </p> <p>As if her song could have no ending; </p> <p>I saw her singing at her work, </p> <p>And o'er the sickle bending; </p> <p>I listened, motionless and still; </p> <p>And, as I mounted up the hill, </p> <p>The music in my heart I bore, </p> <p>Long after it was heard no more. </p> <p>This famous stanza is like a spell that keeps time, in two senses: it keeps the metrical beat of the octosyllabic line, and it also manages to shift into the eternal present of song-time an incident that might otherwise have remained part of the accidental record. When Wordsworth's lines are repeated, the reader or listener re-enters the prolonged trance that the first listener experienced; \"the Maiden\" still sings \"as if her song could have no ending\" because of the entranc ing, prolonging power of the rhymes and cadences. The chance words of Thomas Wilkinson's Tour of Scotland have been magicked into the domain of the eternally recurrent, the once-upon-a-time world of story, where the strains of \"no ending\" and \"still\" and \"more\" echo and overflow above the brim of the usual. </p> <p>The transformations and transports that Wordsworth effects in verse in The Solitary Reaper, David Thomson manages to encompass in the prose - narrative, lyrical, dramatic - of The People Of The Sea. Here too, what was heard in the \"chaunt\" of the storyteller gets fixed on the page, only to rise in all its formality and down-to-earthness at each re-reading. Notations of the author's different tours of Scotland (and of Ireland) have been re-imagined and re-presented in an idiom that makes the reader a kind of dual citizen, at once the inhabitant of a poetically beguiling world of pure story and of a realistically documented world of fishermen and crofters. By performing the task of the historian he was trained to be and that of the artist he was born to become, David Thomson is answering the two calls that reality made upon him. He envisages, even as he records, with the result that librarians are probably hard put to find an exact category for the book: it has elements of both \"fiction\" and \"non-fiction\". Readers, on the other hand, will be carried away on the successive waves of pleasure, as the here-and-nowness of the people and scenes evoked by the author gives way to there-and-thenness of the stories they narrate. </p> <p>David Thomson's achievement is pre-eminently stylistic; his writing combines a feel for the \"this-worldness\" of his characters' lives with an understanding of the \"otherworldness\" they keep a place for in their consciousness. Which is a way of saying that the stylistic achievement depends upon a deep imaginative sympathy. What could have been a matter of fieldwork being written up into a casebook becomes a matter of memory and its contents being liberated into a new and transfigured pattern. The book recovers and revives the old trope of human beings as creatures dwelling in a middle state, caught between the worlds of the angels and the animals; it is obviously an archive of lore about the seal, and obliquely an account of traditional cultures on the verge of dissolution, but at the mythic level it presents us with an image of ourselves in those amphibians we have evolved from, all of us (to quote Wordsworth again) \"inmates of this active universe\", all susceptible to \"the still, sad music of humanity\". </p> <p>What delights is the absence of nostalgia. Even as the men in a cabin give themselves up to an eerie tale of child-kidnap by a seal, one of them is talking about remedies for the warble-fly: \"I tried motor oil and sulfur powder mixed.\" Even as a storyteller invokes the ancient glamour of the Celtic ceo dra\u00edochta , he resolutely de-mystifies it: \"So the seal set up a magic fog, or what is called in modern parlance a smoke screen . . .\" And yet, for all the up-to-dateness of the idiom, the fundamental understanding of these characters is shaped by what the poet Edwin Muir once termed \"that long lost, archaic companionship\" between human beings and the creatures. Plainly, memorably, repeatedly, instances of this old eye-to-eye and breath-to-breath closeness between living things appear in the narrative. Michael the Ferryman judges the strength of the current he is rowing into by watching the toils of the big seal in heavy water adjacent to the boat; a child escaped from drowning is warmed back to consciousness in a \"Black House\" in South Uist between the generous bodies of two cows; on Papa Stour in Shetland, in an old cowshed, the author himself gradually attains a state of almost animal consciousness: </p> <p>\"I heard a raven croak twice. I felt the autumn coldly on my face, but because this old cowshed had been lately used for dipping sheep there was a smell of dung as though the warm life of the farm lingered on.\" </p> <p>Edwin Muir's sense of the need for a renewed covenant with all life and a respect for its sacredness was inspired directly by the shadow of nuclear destruction that loomed over the 1950s. It may be pushing things to suggest that Thomson's book was equally prompted by the prevailing mood, but it is no exaggeration to say that it continues to present itself to the understanding as an elegy for certain salvific elements which \"progress\" and modernity were bound to destroy. </p> <p>The sweetness and intimacy of David Thomson's imagination mean that he is able to bring us very close to that vanished world. His complete at-homeness in the crofts and cabins and \"Black Houses\" he entered, his ability to be all ear and eye, allow the reader access to the otherness of the minds and manners of those he met there. Total respect, intuitive understanding, perfect grace and perfect pitch - possessed of such gifts, he was never regarded as an intruder. The naturalness of his presence seems always to have made up for its unexpectedness; he arrived into other people's lives as simply and mysteriously as Michael the Ferryman arrived into his: </p> <p>\"I stopped to look at a cairn of stones by the roadside. Out of a hole in the ground about fifty yards away, where he was cutting turf, a man came slowly to me. </p> <p>'It's a nice day,' I said. </p> <p>'It is grand drying weather, thanks be to God.' \" </p> <p>In this exchange, the one tiny variation that the Mayo man plays on the author's opening greeting is a guarantee of the complete delicacy and accuracy of David Thomson's ear. The replacement of \"It's\" by \"It is\" indicates the different measure and ever so slight caution of the Irish voice in the English tongue, and reveals in detail the overall trustworthiness of this writing. Little touches carry us at one time out into the exposed spaces of the elemental world, as when he talks of Shetland sheep, \"their horns warm to touch in the rain\"; at another time, a whole culture of human endurance is conjured up in a single observation, as when the young Ronald Iain Finlay remembers coming to in his mother's arms. His father had been drowned and the boy had been washed ashore: \"My mother was weeping again, and I clung to the warmth of her, watching the faces about us, and the faces were steady.\" That steadiness reminds me of Homer's Odysseus bearing up, \"his eyelids steady as wrinkled horn or iron\", listening incognito while the bard Demodicus recites the tale of Troy. </p> <p>And yet for all the Homeric sombreness underlying the attitude of the characters, what is constantly to the fore in the writing is something more gambolling, something more like Arion escaping on the dolphin's back. It is the benignity and essential justice of the relations pertaining between the people of the land and the peo ple of the sea that give these stories an irresistible holistic beauty. Mother seals that suckle human infants, gentlemen seals that provide seal-back rides to the November fair and then go for a drink afterwards, wounded seals that require the hand that cut them open to close them up again, lover seals that arrive \"at the seventh stream\" to meet the yearning young wife - \"and it wasna for good they met so often\" - these are not escapist fantasies but a form of poetry, especially if we think of poetry in terms of its definition as a dream dreamt in the presence of reason. </p> <p>I was lucky enough to get to know David Thomson and his wife, Martina, 20 years after the publication of The People Of The Sea. Woodbrook (1974), a book that was at once an erotic idyll and a work of historical reconstruction, had just appeared and was making a great stir. It told of David's arrival in Ireland in the 1930s as tutor to the young daughter of an Anglo-Irish family in County Roscommon, and through that story contrived also to tell the story of other realities - social, cultural, historical and political - that had been central to Irish life for centuries. Again, this was a version of pastoral, the world regarded through an artfully innocent eye, one that thereby revealed all the more lucidly rights and wrongs, hurts and beauties, usually taken for granted. </p> <p>A result of its success was the increased frequency of the Thomsons' visits to Dublin and other parts of the country, and the opportunity to become friends. By the time of David's death in 1988, the writer whom I had first got to know in print as the co-author (with George Ewart Evans) of another classic beast-book, The Leaping Hare (1972), had published two further books of autobiography, In Camden Town (1983) and Nairn In Darkness And Light (1987), work where he followed his own creative, truth-telling bent with character- istic unpredictability and sprightliness. </p> <p>Nairn In Darkness And Light takes him back to the house he calls Tigh na Rosan in the first chapter of The People Of The Sea, and in the later book he re-creates the Edwardian order of life that reigned there for a few years after the first world war. As the son of a father who had served in the Indian army and had been wounded in the trenches, David was sprung from that socially privileged world, but at the age of 11 what might have been an education and a career typical of one of its members was interrupted. Because of an injury to his eye, which would drastically impair his sight for years to come, his parents sent him north out of England to the large, sea-lit security of his grandparents' home, and it was because of the uncanny purity of his account of that place, and of the life he lived in it, that I found myself one summer night a few years after David's death, on the pier at Nairn. </p> <p>Behind me, the big house he had dwelt in was now a hotel, but out beyond, the Moray Firth still clucked at the pier-head and glimmered like cloudy pewter as far as the horizon. Then suddenly in the early dark the strollers were murmuring and halting, hands were pointing toward an agitation in the water farther out. I heard the word \"dolphins\". There was a perceptible flitter and rollick in the dark offing, and all through my body a tremor of joy: I couldn't help imagining the spirit of our friend, out there astride the dolphin's back, scanning the waves for a selchie, haring it for dear life toward the open sea. </p> <p>\u00a9Seamus Heaney, 2001.

When Edwards-Jones's alter ego Abigail reacts to a nervy moment by telling us she wants to throw up all over her consul (sic), we begin to realise that the author is not, perhaps, Henry James. But as a light-hearted, insiderish account of the squalid world of celebrity, PR, drugs, drink and impossibly small skirts, does My Canap\u00e9 Hell work? Er, not really.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Philip Horne's first exposure to Henry James came when he read The Golden Bowl as an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1976. \"I read about five pages an hour and it took three weeks,\" Horne recalls. \"It was a total immersion.\" A quarter of a century on, Horne is still immersed. His book Henry James and Revision was published in 1990 and he has edited new editions of three James novels. </p> <p>This month sees the paperback publication of his Henry James: A Life in Letters . As the book evolved over 10 years, Horne realised that he was \"fashioning a Victorian life and letters. I felt that the letters were very close to making a narrative you could follow. I just needed to fill in the gaps.\" </p> <p>Through the use of links and introductory paragraphs, Horne builds a convincing case for the letters being, in James's phrase about his brother William's letters, \"his real and best biography\". They are packed with contacts with the leading literary figures of the age - Flaubert, Zola, Turgenev, Thackeray and Ezra Pound all crop up - and contain some of James's major writing. \"There are passages that are quoted as much as anything else he wrote,\" says Horne. </p> <p>There is no complete edition of James's letters, and about half of the 296 letters in Horne's book have not been published before. The consensus is that James wrote between 12,000 and 15,000 letters in his lifetime, but this is guesswork: it could be as high as 40,000. \"I'm not a vocational editor,\" Horne explains. \"I edited them because I felt that someone should and no one else would. I wanted them to be there so I could read them, so this is really the book I wish somebody else had done for me to refer to.\" </p> <p>Unlike many biographers who have worked on a subject for such a long time, Horne has not grown to hate James. He is proud to be the owner of one James's letters to a magazine editor. (\"I was a prisoner in London all winter with gout and fetters,\" James complains in it.) \"A lot are still in private hands and collectors often don't want them published because it reduces their value,\" explains Horne. \"I paid \u00a3400 specifically so I could give myself permission to include it. I'd like a portrait of James, but they are rather more expensive.\" </p> <p>Academic study of James has in recent years been energised by speculation as to James's sexuality. Horne makes no judgment but acknowledges: \"I know others are more eager to read between the lines than me. I was interested in James as, primarily, a creative writer. I thought attention to things that we could definitely know was more rewarding than being preoccupied with things we could only guess at, however interesting they are. But it's not an area I would rule out. There is no question that James knew lots of gay writers and gay men and was on close terms with them. But he was on close terms with lots of people.\" </p> <p>One area where Horne has offered a new reading is that of James's relations with the business of publishing. \"It rather complicates the picture of him as a helpless, unworldly artist in his ivory tower - although that has some truth to it,\" reports Horne. \"He could also be quite hard-nosed and tough, and some of the letters to publishers and editors are fairly firm and even aggressive.\" </p> <p>Horne's next James project takes this theme on, and will further explore James rubbing up against various harsh aspects of the real world - \"James on American politics, the theatre and on the critical controversies of the 1880s,\" says Horne. \"It was quite a knockabout world of polemic and abuse through which he tried to pick his way.\" </p> <p>Although best known through his work on James, Horne has also managed to engage in a wide range of other literary activities. He has been writing literary journalism since he started reviewing new fiction for the London Review of Books in 1983. As Reader in English Literature at University College, London since 1995, he says he has done as much teaching of film - he writes for the film journal Sight and Sound - as he has of Henry James. </p> <p>\"I very much enjoy teaching. When you can get it right, the balance between teaching, writing and journalism can be very good. That balance between solitude and human contact can be the ideal. It keeps your feet on the ground and reminds you what people are interested in.\" </p> <p>His next publication will be an introduction to the new Penguin edition of Oliver Twist . \"Very good fun. A refreshing change from James - and it's nice to work on a best-seller.\" </p> <p>What about the future of letters?

      "bodyText": "Philip Horne's first exposure to Henry James came when he read The Golden Bowl as an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1976. \"I read about five pages an hour and it took three weeks,\" Horne recalls. \"It was a total immersion.\" A quarter of a century on, Horne is still immersed. His book Henry James and Revision was published in 1990 and he has edited new editions of three James novels. This month sees the paperback publication of his Henry James: A Life in Letters . As the book evolved over 10 years, Horne realised that he was \"fashioning a Victorian life and letters. I felt that the letters were very close to making a narrative you could follow. I just needed to fill in the gaps.\" Through the use of links and introductory paragraphs, Horne builds a convincing case for the letters being, in James's phrase about his brother William's letters, \"his real and best biography\". They are packed with contacts with the leading literary figures of the age - Flaubert, Zola, Turgenev, Thackeray and Ezra Pound all crop up - and contain some of James's major writing. \"There are passages that are quoted as much as anything else he wrote,\" says Horne. There is no complete edition of James's letters, and about half of the 296 letters in Horne's book have not been published before. The consensus is that James wrote between 12,000 and 15,000 letters in his lifetime, but this is guesswork: it could be as high as 40,000. \"I'm not a vocational editor,\" Horne explains. \"I edited them because I felt that someone should and no one else would. I wanted them to be there so I could read them, so this is really the book I wish somebody else had done for me to refer to.\" Unlike many biographers who have worked on a subject for such a long time, Horne has not grown to hate James. He is proud to be the owner of one James's letters to a magazine editor. (\"I was a prisoner in London all winter with gout and fetters,\" James complains in it.) \"A lot are still in private hands and collectors often don't want them published because it reduces their value,\" explains Horne. \"I paid \u00a3400 specifically so I could give myself permission to include it. I'd like a portrait of James, but they are rather more expensive.\" Academic study of James has in recent years been energised by speculation as to James's sexuality. Horne makes no judgment but acknowledges: \"I know others are more eager to read between the lines than me. I was interested in James as, primarily, a creative writer. I thought attention to things that we could definitely know was more rewarding than being preoccupied with things we could only guess at, however interesting they are. But it's not an area I would rule out. There is no question that James knew lots of gay writers and gay men and was on close terms with them. But he was on close terms with lots of people.\" One area where Horne has offered a new reading is that of James's relations with the business of publishing. \"It rather complicates the picture of him as a helpless, unworldly artist in his ivory tower - although that has some truth to it,\" reports Horne. \"He could also be quite hard-nosed and tough, and some of the letters to publishers and editors are fairly firm and even aggressive.\" Horne's next James project takes this theme on, and will further explore James rubbing up against various harsh aspects of the real world - \"James on American politics, the theatre and on the critical controversies of the 1880s,\" says Horne. \"It was quite a knockabout world of polemic and abuse through which he tried to pick his way.\" Although best known through his work on James, Horne has also managed to engage in a wide range of other literary activities. He has been writing literary journalism since he started reviewing new fiction for the London Review of Books in 1983. As Reader in English Literature at University College, London since 1995, he says he has done as much teaching of film - he writes for the film journal Sight and Sound - as he has of Henry James. \"I very much enjoy teaching. When you can get it right, the balance between teaching, writing and journalism can be very good. That balance between solitude and human contact can be the ideal. It keeps your feet on the ground and reminds you what people are interested in.\" His next publication will be an introduction to the new Penguin edition of Oliver Twist . \"Very good fun. A refreshing change from James - and it's nice to work on a best-seller.\" What about the future of letters? Will technology kill off this literary resource? \"Well, someone will need to print out emails in order for them to survive,\" say Horne. \"The electronic form is always liable to be cleaned out or the software won't be supported. Paper is still the primary medium, and I certainly print out the interesting emails I get.\" One way in which email will help is by solving the problem of indecipherable handwriting. By re-examining the originals, Horne has uncovered several mistakes in previous editions of the letters that alter the sense of what James actually said. \"But while emails will of course make it easier, it will also be less exciting,\" says Horne, whose enthusiasm for tracking down odd scraps all over the world appears undiminished. \"It just won't be the same as a scholar in the archives looking at crumbling old letters written in mauve ink with an actual signature on the end.\"",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/reviews/generalfiction/0,6121,439283,00.html\">Read the review</a></p> <p>Early on in David Lodge's latest novel, Thinks..., one of his characters tells a joke about consciousness. \"Two behaviourist psychologists have sex, and afterwards one says to the other, 'it was good for you, how was it for me?'\" It is a quintessential Lodge joke; funny, includes sex, is clever and is told by an academic. Lodge and his close friend and former university colleague Malcolm Bradbury - who died late last year and whose career was apparently so entwined with Lodge's in the public mind that the word Lodgebury was coined for them - for a time made the territory of layered jokes, literary allusions and sexual hijinks featuring lecturers their own. It was a popular combination. Lodge's novels were best-sellers and critically acclaimed - he has been twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize for his books Small World and Nice Work. </p> <p>But this represents only part of his story: only three of Lodge's previous 10 novels have been set on campuses, and as professor of modern English literature at the University of Birmingham - he took early retirement in 1987 - he deliberately set out to distance himself from the levity in his fiction. He was seen as a rather serious and forbidding figure, and his reputation as a critic, which is still high, was made in the dauntingly difficult fields of post-structuralist literary theory. </p> <p>Fellow Birmingham novelist Jim Crace says he was intrigued by Lodge's two roles and how they overlapped. It only really made sense to him, he says, after attending one of Lodge's lectures. \"I realised that when he wrote novels he wasn't in any way trashing his academic vocabulary or instincts. It was just that here was someone from an ordinary south London background whose natural voice was an idiomatic one. He has the capacity to put complicated ideas over in ordinary language while retaining great depth and clarity.\" </p> <p>Crace says that because of this Lodge's novels are inherently democratic. \"You can read his books for a while without realising the clever intellectual beasts that are lurking beneath the surface. For instance you could read Nice Work [in which a young female leftist English lecturer meets a male middle-aged Thatcherite businessman] as just an attractive, sexy and convincing love story. But it's also all about the relationship between literature and making things, between the academy and industry. These things are not just central to his work, they are central to the life of the city he lives in. He uses plot as the Trojan horse to smuggle in really interesting ideas.\" </p> <p>The scientist, novelist and playwright Carl Djerassi - dubbed the father of the contraceptive pill - agrees. He used quotations from Lodge's 1965 novel, The British Museum Is Falling Down, in his lectures on the ethics of birth control. \"In that novel [Lodge] presented the case of the Catholic disillusioned with the church's unyielding message,\" says Djerassi. \"It was a very effective statement of that viewpoint in the debate.\" </p> <p>Lodge's Catholicism has been a consistent strand throughout all his fiction. Graham Greene called his 1980 Whitbread prizewinning novel, How Far Can you Go?, \"a magnificent book\". In it Lodge chronicled a group of Catholics over 25 years as they wrestled with the moral implications of the second Vatican Council and its encyclical Humanae Vitae on birth control and abortion. The critic and poet Crag Raine claims it is \"one of the great post-war novels\", praising its telling mixture of comedy and pathos. \"I remember reading it until three in the morning. When I went to bed my wife switched on the light and asked what had happened. My face was swollen with tears. It is a tremendously sad book but also very funny.\" Lodge's work is extremely popular in Catholic Europe, and particularly in France. </p> <p>In Thinks..., partly through the device of making a philandering academic who is investigating artificial intelligence and consciousness speak his most secret thoughts into a tape recorder, he subtly mixes ethical and spiritual issues with a blend of science, literature, love and ambition. Raine, who recently extracted the opening section in his literary magazine Arete, says it is incredibly funny. \"But the stream of consciousness in the English novel, of that radical sort, seemed to have come into its own and been exhausted by Joyce at the end of Ulysses. But it seemed to me that David had got new mileage out of it - an astonishing thing to have done.\" </p> <p>Lodge's character claims that the problem of consciousness \"is the biggest game in town\". Lodge plainly agrees. He describes himself as \"terrifically interested\" in the implications of the new artificial intelligence and neurobiology view of consciousness - \"that all your hopes and fears and everything you think of as yourself are just a lot of molecules interacting in your brain\" - for someone who shares the traditional Christian idea of the soul and the self. </p> <p>Lodge did not have a typical Catholic upbringing. He says his mother was not particularly devout and his father wasn't even a Catholic. His Catholicism came mainly through education, and he now describes himself as an agnostic Catholic hanging on by his fingernails. \"While I can't say I believe literally in the articles of Catholic faith, I see some value in continuing to belong to the church. It still addresses fundamental questions that remain even if you kick religion into touch.\" </p> <p>He was born in Dulwich, south London, in 1935. A year later the family moved a few miles north east to Brockley where he was brought up. His mother, Rosalie, was a secretary and clerical worker whose last job was at Goldsmiths College Library, where Lodge is now an honorary fellow. His father, Bill, played saxophone and clarinet professionally with popular dance bands. They bought the house in Brockley because it was on the all-night tram route so he could get home from gigs in London. Lodge says he also sang, \"in one of those high, sweet tenor voices people used to like in those days.\" </p> <p>When war came his father was posted to India in a kind of It Ain't Half Hot Mum concert party, but despite being in the air force, never once went up in an aeroplane. After the war he diversified and became a TV and film walk-on actor. \"He was in Porridge and the film There's A Girl In My Soup,\" smiles Lodge. \"He'd phone me up to tell me when the repeats were on.\" He died last year aged 93 in the Brockley house. Rosalie Lodge died in 1989. </p> <p>Lodge says the war ensured he had a very disturbed education: he attended at least six schools. One was a convent in Surrey. \"If I were a psychoanalyst I would say that this was a crucial experience for me,\" he says. \"My mother left me there, aged about five, as a boarder, and I was traumatised by it. I had never been on my own before. I hated the food and was frightened of many of the nuns. It was a real Dickens-in-the-blacking-factory feeling. She came back after a fortnight, saw I was very unhappy, then stayed in the village and we lived in digs. But I felt I had been abandoned.\" </p> <p>He says it has left him with a residual propensity to anxiety. While not wishing to give examples he says he still gets very anxious about things which in retrospect are not worth it. \"I imagine worst scenarios and frighten myself,\" he explains. \"But I suppose recognising that you are neurotically anxious is half way to coming to terms. It took me some time to realise I had this trait.\" </p> <p>Lodge went to secondary school at Saint Joseph's Academy, Blackheath which was run by the De La Salle order of Catholic brothers. Frank Pycroft was in the same form as Lodge for five years and remembers him as, \"a very brilliant child. He stood out and was ahead of most of us. He still speaks in exactly the same tone of voice as he did then.\" Lodge says the brothers, \"weren't very intellectual, the quality of the teaching was not good and they were deep into corporal punishment, as were most Catholic schools of that period. It now seems to me barbarous. We were punished for getting things wrong, and the idea that teaching should be instilled in that way was taken for granted. But that pretty much ceased in the sixth form. It was much more relaxed and I could really start to enjoy learning.\" </p> <p>He was encouraged by an Irish teacher who had written novels in Gaelic. Although Lodge wanted to leave school to become a cub reporter, the headmaster advised his parents that he was clever enough to go to university. \"This was unknown territory for the family,\" he says. \"The first short story I ever wrote was about being interviewed at County Hall for a London County Council scholarship.\" </p> <p>He says he literally didn't know there were any universities apart from Oxford, Cambridge and London. \"I didn't apply to either Oxford or Cambridge because I knew from Evelyn Waugh's Decline And Fall that it was all getting debagged in the quad by raving drunken aristocrats.\" So he lived at home and attended University College London where he gained a first. While there he wrote a novel which was never published - \"it was called The Devil, The World And The Flesh and I knew nothing about any of them\" - and when he was offered a post-graduate studentship he first declined, saying his intention was to leave and write full time, but then deferred it until after his national service. \"Two weeks into basic training I knew I wanted to get back to that nice world where you read books in warm libraries.\" </p> <p>His experience in the army was faithfully covered in his 1962 novel Ginger You're Barmy. \"I was in the Royal Tank Regiment at a depot in Dorset. My strategy was to get as much privacy as possible so I wangled myself a bunk in a barracks completely on my own. It was supposed to be a security thing but it was just a skive. It meant I could write and read in the evenings. I took all my possible leave and used to go to London for 36 hours to see my girlfriend and go to the theatre.\" </p> <p>While he describes himself as unpolitical, he did identify with the Angry Young Men and their sense of opposition to the establishment. \"I saw Look Back In Anger at the Royal Court. I was going through this dreary and pointless servitude, and hearing Jimmy Porter talk about chinless wonders with such a savage satirical tone was a joy.\" </p> <p>When he returned to London as a postgraduate he produced a 700-page thesis on Catholic fiction. The following year the authorities introduced a word limit. \"There were many more Catholic novels than I or anyone else had ever dreamt of,\" laughs Lodge. \"Many of them in the British Museum library had never even been cut, so I was there with a paper knife ripping my way though these terrible books. I can't believe I did it now.\" </p> <p>Park Honan, emeritus professor at the University of Leeds, has known Lodge since they were at UCL together. \"David was intense, well focused and a delightful chap. We met at a short story circle at which he was already in effect teaching a group of students and staff the techniques of the short story.\" </p> <p>In 1959 Lodge got his first academic job working for the British Council in London, where he taught English language and gave a weekly lecture in English literature from Beowulf to Virginia Woolf. \"And we had to introduce foreign students to English life, so we would solemnly tell them how to eat a kipper and use a gas meter and things like that.\" In the same year he also submitted his thesis, finished his first novel, The Picturegoers, and married his long-time girlfriend, Mary Jacobs. </p> <p>They had met while undergraduates. They now have three children and two grandchildren. Mary went on to be an English teacher specialising in teaching teenagers with special needs. \"That's partly because we have a Down's syndrome boy ourselves,\" Lodge explains. Their daughter, Julia, is a micro-biologist and their elder son, Stephen is a solicitor specialising in employment law, Their younger son, Christopher who is 31, has Down's and lives in a community in Ironbridge, Telford, which is about an hour from their home in Edgbaston in Birmingham. </p> <p>\"Christopher was a terrific shock,\" says Lodge. \"It never occurred to me that anything could go wrong. Mary was very healthy, wasn't old and had produced the first two children with tremendous ease. It took a long time to come to terms with, but in many ways it has been a very valuable educative experience. Chris is a delightful person and shows extraordinary intuition and intelligence. Sometimes you can see what could have been an exceptional person if he hadn't had the extra chromosome. But he is quite able and can travel alone and can read and write. He lived at home until he was 21 but he now needs to be in a community where he is under supervision.\" </p> <p>Park Honan says: \"Christopher has been rewarding in ways that one's children are often not rewarding. They tend to go off and get married and have separate lives. Christopher remains a close, affectionate, amusing member of the family with skills of his own. He is passionately devoted to David.\" </p> <p>Lodge says Christopher's birth was the first thing that taught him his life wasn't necessarily going to be a smooth upward escalator. \"But fortunately his handicap was not too severe and he has achieved a lot. We feel we have maximised his potential and that he has a pretty full life. I don't think I could have psychologically handled someone who suffered terribly from cerebral palsy, say. I'm aware of cases where a severely disabled child has either damaged the marriage or damaged relationships with the siblings. I am very pleased that we have avoided that. But there is always a sense of some human potential there that is forever negated, which is kind of sad.\" </p> <p>Lodge was appointed to Birmingham University in 1960 on a one year temporary contract. The following year the post was made permanent and he has never had a formal interview for a job since. Richard Hoggart, who was professor of English at Birmingham when Lodge was a young lecturer there, remembers him as \"a very good member of department. Which is interesting if you are also trying to make your name as a writer. The temptation is to let the department look after itself.\" Hoggart says when he first arrived at the university he felt isolated. \"A new professor is in a funny position. You're a bit of a tin god and people are hesitant about intruding on you. But David was one of the few who made the effort to come to my office and say hello and ask if I wanted a coffee or to have lunch. He wasn't trying to butter me up, he was just being friendly.\" </p> <p>It was at Birmingham that Lodge met Malcolm Bradbury. \"We were eager to make friends as we were the youngest members of the department and were the only ones really interested in a modern literature,\" recalls Lodge. </p> <p>Each had just published his first novel and had similar career plans to run an academic career alongside a writing career. They collaborated on a stage review for the Birmingham rep which Lodge says was a formative experience for him. \"I had never tried to write anything just to make people laugh. My first two novels were rather sober realism and Malcolm encouraged me to write comedy. I found I both enjoyed it and could do it and it became a much more important part of my work as a result.\" </p> <p>But Lodge acknowledges that after a few years it became clear the two could not go on in the same department, \"it would have become too incestuous. Although I was sorry when he left, [Bradbury set up the creative writing and American literature courses at the University of East Anglia] in retrospect it was probably a good thing for both of us.\" </p> <p>Another great spur to Lodge's writing were two trips he made to America in the mid and late 60s. \"I was in Berkeley just as flower power was reaching its peak. I was there for the first big teach-in with Norman Mailer. I remember thinking 'this was history'. I also discovered the possibilities of life that America can offer.\" Park Honan, an American himself, says \"David found himself inundated by talk and enthusiasm and questioning and he was energised by that.\" </p> <p>But despite this enthusiasm for the States, and several job offers elsewhere in England, Lodge chose to stay in Birmingham. \"As the family became more rooted so the idea of moving became less attractive\", he says. The Birmingham playwright David Edgar praises Lodge's commitment to the city. Lodge has written two plays himself and contributed to Edgar's MA playwriting course at the university. \"We had a session on the difference between real speech and dramatic speech,\" says Edgar. \"We analysed a Pinter play and Prince Charles's mobile phone conversation with Camilla. The students liked David a lot. He is a very good teacher.\" </p> <p>Edgar also attended a series of lunches Lodge organised for West Midlands writers. \"David has played an important role in which saying you are a Birmingham writer is a badge of pride. He's not an uncritical advocate for Birmingham. But that he's chosen to set so many novels here, chosen to live here, chosen it as his place of work has been very important.\" </p> <p>Rummidge was Lodge's fictional Birmingham, affectionately satirised, and the novels set in the city and university are amongst his best known, including Changing Places and Small World. Richard Hoggart particularly praises another Rummidge novel, Nice Work as, \"a penetration of the inadequacies of academic views of industry. There are few academic novelists who would do that. It's not just a novel about academic life, it's a novel about the limits of academic life.\" </p> <p>It is Changing Places and Small World that most prominently feature libidinous lecturers running all over the world to conferences while swapping wives and engaging in witty literary debate. Friends who know Lodge say how surprised they are at how much sex he includes in his books. He describes his stance as, \"a war correspondent, not a combatant. My wife is my first reader. If she had some deep objection to something I would have to take that into account. But that hasn't happened.\" </p> <p>He says his children didn't read the books when they were growing up and acknowledges a certain amount of embarrassment. \"With your family you just implicitly draw a boundary. It's like children don't usually ask their parents about their sex life, but would ask somebody else about their sex life. There is a taboo.\" </p> <p>He says part of the appeal of fiction is that it is about the inner life and it is revealing what is normally kept private. \"Novels give us this illusion of insight into what people are really thinking, and sex is the great area of mystery and curiosity. The novel has always been focused on that area of life, whether it was sexually explicit or not. Jane Austen gives you this detailed sense of what people are really thinking in terms of their choice of marriage partner. That means there is always some sort of implied self-exposure when you write a novel. People say it may not have happened to him, but he must have been thinking about it.\" </p> <p>Jim Crace says that while in one way Lodge's books are completely autobiographical, you actually learn nothing about him from them. In Therapy [his 1995 novel about a popular television writer in mid-life crisis who finds hope in a Catholic pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella and the philosophy of Kierkegaard], a man had just taken on a little flat in London. Crace says, \"So had David. The man spent a lot of time on the train to London like David, and had just been on the Compostella route like David. It was like he had been playing pinball with his own life, lighting up all the things he had just done, so it seems to be an entirely autobiographical work. But in a strange way we learn nothing about him from that book.\" </p> <p>Lodge has practised this discretion in both his guises - as writer and academic. He says he always tried to draw boundaries between the two professions. \"When I retired it was something of a relief for that reason. I had kept my novel-writing as a private activity but there was a sort of contradiction which became more and more acute as I got more senior: the responsible persona of the professor and the rather anarchic and subversive persona of the novelist. So the way I coped was to split myself in two and I had a rather severe teaching persona as a result.\" </p> <p>Does he miss the chalk-face of academic criticism? \"Not really. As the post-structuralist movement became more and more institutionalised I think it became increasingly arid. I was engaged in that revolution in criticism, but by the time I retired I was beginning to get a little weary of it. Academic criticism has become terribly professionalised and is no longer addressed to an educated general public. It is sad that there is no longer a cross-fertilisation between academic criticism, literary journalism and creative writing.\" </p> <p>Lodge himself has maintained the links, and still reviews widely. In 1992 he began a weekly column for the Independent on Sunday, looking at different aspects of writing; repetition, a sense of place, interior monologue. The articles were later published as a book, The Art Of Fiction, but one column, on plagiarism, wasn't included. Lodge and the newspaper had been sued for libel by a Mills &amp; Boon writer after alleging that she had plagiarised his novel Nice Work. They subsequently apologised and accepted that the similarities were coincidental. Three years later the Mills &amp; Boon author was given \"substantial\" damages and a public apology in the high court. </p> <p>As part of the settlement, there are constraints on what Lodge can say about the case, but there is no evidence that it has blunted his critical edge or dampened his enthusiasm for literature. After 40 years, though, his perspective on the novel has shifted. </p> <p>When Malcolm Bradbury died, Lodge said to a friend that he felt an epoch had ended. And he admits \"I find it more and more difficult to write fiction. And in a way I get less and less pleasure out of reading fiction than I used to, although I still enjoy re-reading classic fiction. I think it is something to do with getting old. Reading fiction requires quite a lot of brain work.\" But his commitment to the novel is fundamentally still strong \"as a way of exploring experience. It is still the format I have had the highest regard for and the most interest in. It is the most flexible and inclusive literary form. </p> <p>\"I don't have any answer to the problem of consciousness, the problem of religious belief or the problem of materialism versus transcendentalism. But to me one of the attractions of fiction is that it is a way of exploring ideas or large abstract themes in a way which doesn't necessarily oblige you to answer the questions definitively.

      "bodyText": "Read the review Early on in David Lodge's latest novel, Thinks..., one of his characters tells a joke about consciousness. \"Two behaviourist psychologists have sex, and afterwards one says to the other, 'it was good for you, how was it for me?'\" It is a quintessential Lodge joke; funny, includes sex, is clever and is told by an academic. Lodge and his close friend and former university colleague Malcolm Bradbury - who died late last year and whose career was apparently so entwined with Lodge's in the public mind that the word Lodgebury was coined for them - for a time made the territory of layered jokes, literary allusions and sexual hijinks featuring lecturers their own. It was a popular combination. Lodge's novels were best-sellers and critically acclaimed - he has been twice shortlisted for the Booker Prize for his books Small World and Nice Work. But this represents only part of his story: only three of Lodge's previous 10 novels have been set on campuses, and as professor of modern English literature at the University of Birmingham - he took early retirement in 1987 - he deliberately set out to distance himself from the levity in his fiction. He was seen as a rather serious and forbidding figure, and his reputation as a critic, which is still high, was made in the dauntingly difficult fields of post-structuralist literary theory. Fellow Birmingham novelist Jim Crace says he was intrigued by Lodge's two roles and how they overlapped. It only really made sense to him, he says, after attending one of Lodge's lectures. \"I realised that when he wrote novels he wasn't in any way trashing his academic vocabulary or instincts. It was just that here was someone from an ordinary south London background whose natural voice was an idiomatic one. He has the capacity to put complicated ideas over in ordinary language while retaining great depth and clarity.\" Crace says that because of this Lodge's novels are inherently democratic. \"You can read his books for a while without realising the clever intellectual beasts that are lurking beneath the surface. For instance you could read Nice Work [in which a young female leftist English lecturer meets a male middle-aged Thatcherite businessman] as just an attractive, sexy and convincing love story. But it's also all about the relationship between literature and making things, between the academy and industry. These things are not just central to his work, they are central to the life of the city he lives in. He uses plot as the Trojan horse to smuggle in really interesting ideas.\" The scientist, novelist and playwright Carl Djerassi - dubbed the father of the contraceptive pill - agrees. He used quotations from Lodge's 1965 novel, The British Museum Is Falling Down, in his lectures on the ethics of birth control. \"In that novel [Lodge] presented the case of the Catholic disillusioned with the church's unyielding message,\" says Djerassi. \"It was a very effective statement of that viewpoint in the debate.\" Lodge's Catholicism has been a consistent strand throughout all his fiction. Graham Greene called his 1980 Whitbread prizewinning novel, How Far Can you Go?, \"a magnificent book\". In it Lodge chronicled a group of Catholics over 25 years as they wrestled with the moral implications of the second Vatican Council and its encyclical Humanae Vitae on birth control and abortion. The critic and poet Crag Raine claims it is \"one of the great post-war novels\", praising its telling mixture of comedy and pathos. \"I remember reading it until three in the morning. When I went to bed my wife switched on the light and asked what had happened. My face was swollen with tears. It is a tremendously sad book but also very funny.\" Lodge's work is extremely popular in Catholic Europe, and particularly in France. In Thinks..., partly through the device of making a philandering academic who is investigating artificial intelligence and consciousness speak his most secret thoughts into a tape recorder, he subtly mixes ethical and spiritual issues with a blend of science, literature, love and ambition. Raine, who recently extracted the opening section in his literary magazine Arete, says it is incredibly funny. \"But the stream of consciousness in the English novel, of that radical sort, seemed to have come into its own and been exhausted by Joyce at the end of Ulysses. But it seemed to me that David had got new mileage out of it - an astonishing thing to have done.\" Lodge's character claims that the problem of consciousness \"is the biggest game in town\". Lodge plainly agrees. He describes himself as \"terrifically interested\" in the implications of the new artificial intelligence and neurobiology view of consciousness - \"that all your hopes and fears and everything you think of as yourself are just a lot of molecules interacting in your brain\" - for someone who shares the traditional Christian idea of the soul and the self. Lodge did not have a typical Catholic upbringing. He says his mother was not particularly devout and his father wasn't even a Catholic. His Catholicism came mainly through education, and he now describes himself as an agnostic Catholic hanging on by his fingernails. \"While I can't say I believe literally in the articles of Catholic faith, I see some value in continuing to belong to the church. It still addresses fundamental questions that remain even if you kick religion into touch.\" He was born in Dulwich, south London, in 1935. A year later the family moved a few miles north east to Brockley where he was brought up. His mother, Rosalie, was a secretary and clerical worker whose last job was at Goldsmiths College Library, where Lodge is now an honorary fellow. His father, Bill, played saxophone and clarinet professionally with popular dance bands. They bought the house in Brockley because it was on the all-night tram route so he could get home from gigs in London. Lodge says he also sang, \"in one of those high, sweet tenor voices people used to like in those days.\" When war came his father was posted to India in a kind of It Ain't Half Hot Mum concert party, but despite being in the air force, never once went up in an aeroplane. After the war he diversified and became a TV and film walk-on actor. \"He was in Porridge and the film There's A Girl In My Soup,\" smiles Lodge. \"He'd phone me up to tell me when the repeats were on.\" He died last year aged 93 in the Brockley house. Rosalie Lodge died in 1989. Lodge says the war ensured he had a very disturbed education: he attended at least six schools. One was a convent in Surrey. \"If I were a psychoanalyst I would say that this was a crucial experience for me,\" he says. \"My mother left me there, aged about five, as a boarder, and I was traumatised by it. I had never been on my own before. I hated the food and was frightened of many of the nuns. It was a real Dickens-in-the-blacking-factory feeling. She came back after a fortnight, saw I was very unhappy, then stayed in the village and we lived in digs. But I felt I had been abandoned.\" He says it has left him with a residual propensity to anxiety. While not wishing to give examples he says he still gets very anxious about things which in retrospect are not worth it. \"I imagine worst scenarios and frighten myself,\" he explains. \"But I suppose recognising that you are neurotically anxious is half way to coming to terms. It took me some time to realise I had this trait.\" Lodge went to secondary school at Saint Joseph's Academy, Blackheath which was run by the De La Salle order of Catholic brothers. Frank Pycroft was in the same form as Lodge for five years and remembers him as, \"a very brilliant child. He stood out and was ahead of most of us. He still speaks in exactly the same tone of voice as he did then.\" Lodge says the brothers, \"weren't very intellectual, the quality of the teaching was not good and they were deep into corporal punishment, as were most Catholic schools of that period. It now seems to me barbarous. We were punished for getting things wrong, and the idea that teaching should be instilled in that way was taken for granted. But that pretty much ceased in the sixth form. It was much more relaxed and I could really start to enjoy learning.\" He was encouraged by an Irish teacher who had written novels in Gaelic. Although Lodge wanted to leave school to become a cub reporter, the headmaster advised his parents that he was clever enough to go to university. \"This was unknown territory for the family,\" he says. \"The first short story I ever wrote was about being interviewed at County Hall for a London County Council scholarship.\" He says he literally didn't know there were any universities apart from Oxford, Cambridge and London. \"I didn't apply to either Oxford or Cambridge because I knew from Evelyn Waugh's Decline And Fall that it was all getting debagged in the quad by raving drunken aristocrats.\" So he lived at home and attended University College London where he gained a first. While there he wrote a novel which was never published - \"it was called The Devil, The World And The Flesh and I knew nothing about any of them\" - and when he was offered a post-graduate studentship he first declined, saying his intention was to leave and write full time, but then deferred it until after his national service. \"Two weeks into basic training I knew I wanted to get back to that nice world where you read books in warm libraries.\" His experience in the army was faithfully covered in his 1962 novel Ginger You're Barmy. \"I was in the Royal Tank Regiment at a depot in Dorset. My strategy was to get as much privacy as possible so I wangled myself a bunk in a barracks completely on my own. It was supposed to be a security thing but it was just a skive. It meant I could write and read in the evenings. I took all my possible leave and used to go to London for 36 hours to see my girlfriend and go to the theatre.\" While he describes himself as unpolitical, he did identify with the Angry Young Men and their sense of opposition to the establishment. \"I saw Look Back In Anger at the Royal Court. I was going through this dreary and pointless servitude, and hearing Jimmy Porter talk about chinless wonders with such a savage satirical tone was a joy.\" When he returned to London as a postgraduate he produced a 700-page thesis on Catholic fiction. The following year the authorities introduced a word limit. \"There were many more Catholic novels than I or anyone else had ever dreamt of,\" laughs Lodge. \"Many of them in the British Museum library had never even been cut, so I was there with a paper knife ripping my way though these terrible books. I can't believe I did it now.\" Park Honan, emeritus professor at the University of Leeds, has known Lodge since they were at UCL together. \"David was intense, well focused and a delightful chap. We met at a short story circle at which he was already in effect teaching a group of students and staff the techniques of the short story.\" In 1959 Lodge got his first academic job working for the British Council in London, where he taught English language and gave a weekly lecture in English literature from Beowulf to Virginia Woolf. \"And we had to introduce foreign students to English life, so we would solemnly tell them how to eat a kipper and use a gas meter and things like that.\" In the same year he also submitted his thesis, finished his first novel, The Picturegoers, and married his long-time girlfriend, Mary Jacobs. They had met while undergraduates. They now have three children and two grandchildren. Mary went on to be an English teacher specialising in teaching teenagers with special needs. \"That's partly because we have a Down's syndrome boy ourselves,\" Lodge explains. Their daughter, Julia, is a micro-biologist and their elder son, Stephen is a solicitor specialising in employment law, Their younger son, Christopher who is 31, has Down's and lives in a community in Ironbridge, Telford, which is about an hour from their home in Edgbaston in Birmingham. \"Christopher was a terrific shock,\" says Lodge. \"It never occurred to me that anything could go wrong. Mary was very healthy, wasn't old and had produced the first two children with tremendous ease. It took a long time to come to terms with, but in many ways it has been a very valuable educative experience. Chris is a delightful person and shows extraordinary intuition and intelligence. Sometimes you can see what could have been an exceptional person if he hadn't had the extra chromosome. But he is quite able and can travel alone and can read and write. He lived at home until he was 21 but he now needs to be in a community where he is under supervision.\" Park Honan says: \"Christopher has been rewarding in ways that one's children are often not rewarding. They tend to go off and get married and have separate lives. Christopher remains a close, affectionate, amusing member of the family with skills of his own. He is passionately devoted to David.\" Lodge says Christopher's birth was the first thing that taught him his life wasn't necessarily going to be a smooth upward escalator. \"But fortunately his handicap was not too severe and he has achieved a lot. We feel we have maximised his potential and that he has a pretty full life. I don't think I could have psychologically handled someone who suffered terribly from cerebral palsy, say. I'm aware of cases where a severely disabled child has either damaged the marriage or damaged relationships with the siblings. I am very pleased that we have avoided that. But there is always a sense of some human potential there that is forever negated, which is kind of sad.\" Lodge was appointed to Birmingham University in 1960 on a one year temporary contract. The following year the post was made permanent and he has never had a formal interview for a job since. Richard Hoggart, who was professor of English at Birmingham when Lodge was a young lecturer there, remembers him as \"a very good member of department. Which is interesting if you are also trying to make your name as a writer. The temptation is to let the department look after itself.\" Hoggart says when he first arrived at the university he felt isolated. \"A new professor is in a funny position. You're a bit of a tin god and people are hesitant about intruding on you. But David was one of the few who made the effort to come to my office and say hello and ask if I wanted a coffee or to have lunch. He wasn't trying to butter me up, he was just being friendly.\" It was at Birmingham that Lodge met Malcolm Bradbury. \"We were eager to make friends as we were the youngest members of the department and were the only ones really interested in a modern literature,\" recalls Lodge. Each had just published his first novel and had similar career plans to run an academic career alongside a writing career. They collaborated on a stage review for the Birmingham rep which Lodge says was a formative experience for him. \"I had never tried to write anything just to make people laugh. My first two novels were rather sober realism and Malcolm encouraged me to write comedy. I found I both enjoyed it and could do it and it became a much more important part of my work as a result.\" But Lodge acknowledges that after a few years it became clear the two could not go on in the same department, \"it would have become too incestuous. Although I was sorry when he left, [Bradbury set up the creative writing and American literature courses at the University of East Anglia] in retrospect it was probably a good thing for both of us.\" Another great spur to Lodge's writing were two trips he made to America in the mid and late 60s. \"I was in Berkeley just as flower power was reaching its peak. I was there for the first big teach-in with Norman Mailer. I remember thinking 'this was history'. I also discovered the possibilities of life that America can offer.\" Park Honan, an American himself, says \"David found himself inundated by talk and enthusiasm and questioning and he was energised by that.\" But despite this enthusiasm for the States, and several job offers elsewhere in England, Lodge chose to stay in Birmingham. \"As the family became more rooted so the idea of moving became less attractive\", he says.

The students liked David a lot. He is a very good teacher.\" Edgar also attended a series of lunches Lodge organised for West Midlands writers. \"David has played an important role in which saying you are a Birmingham writer is a badge of pride. He's not an uncritical advocate for Birmingham. But that he's chosen to set so many novels here, chosen to live here, chosen it as his place of work has been very important.\" Rummidge was Lodge's fictional Birmingham, affectionately satirised, and the novels set in the city and university are amongst his best known, including Changing Places and Small World. Richard Hoggart particularly praises another Rummidge novel, Nice Work as, \"a penetration of the inadequacies of academic views of industry. There are few academic novelists who would do that.

Friends who know Lodge say how surprised they are at how much sex he includes in his books. He describes his stance as, \"a war correspondent, not a combatant. My wife is my first reader.

The Israeli poet Abba Kovner is one of the more redoubtable figures of the era, having been a leader of the Jewish armed resistance in the Lithuanian city of Vilna. Kovner, though, prefers poetry to prosaic detail when relating his experiences in the Fareinikte Partizaner Organizatsie (the United Partisans Organisation).

The Avengers , fortunately, cuts back on style-slave self-referentialism and concentrates on giving us a story, pure and simple. </p> <p>From the outset, the tale follows the familiar path of the doomed Jewish communities of eastern and middle Europe. Activists across the political spectrum banded together and set about their desperate work of fending off the Nazi threat. \"No one who has never been in the ghetto will understand the mass fear of collective responsibility,\" Kovner was to write later. Cohen, however, does an impressive job in drawing out the emotional trauma of law-abiding citizens suddenly forced to confront the barbaric arbitrariness of German administration methods: every sabotage action would automatically be greeted with a round of random executions and torture. </p> <p>Cohen also expertly dramatises the central conundrum of the ghetto, the thing that seems unimaginable in hindsight: that hardly anyone saw it coming. Kovner was one of the few who did, with his now-celebrated manifesto - \"we will not be led like sheep to the slaughter\" - in January 1943. The second half of The Avengers follows Kovner and the FPO to postwar Palestine where, as Jewish Europe lay in ruins, the Zionist dream was taking shape. Detailing an era in which Zionism was the mantra of a righteous crusade, Cohen's rich narrative explores the seismic shifts that Jews experienced in the late 1940s, exchanging the shattered landscape of Europe for the Biblical vistas of the infant state of Israel. </p> <p>Enthralling as Cohen's story is, it's a pity that the pivotal episode of the tale - and the one that gives the book its title - is so brief. In 1945, after the war was over, Kovner and his group plotted a series of revenge killings against Nazis in Allied jails. Their most successful attack - poisoning the bread supply of a Nuremberg prison camp - accounted for more than 2,000 Einsatzgruppen and concentration-camp guards. No figures for fatalities were ever released.

Shocked at what she read, she had to badger Saul to get her manuscript back. Eventually he relinquished it - well-thumbed, and torn. Her case would be that the structure of her book and Wells's were very similar, as were many of the ideas. Much of the phrasing was virtually identical too, she argued; both had the same mistakes and omissions. Deeks spent the best part of a year compiling a concordance of hundreds of verbal similarities; by the time this was done, she was certain of her ground. With her family's support, she tried to get justice, and the admission that there had been a serious act of literary piracy. Her case depended on two points: the intrinsic evidence of the verbal and structural similarities between her manuscript and The Outline of History , and the assumption that Wells had somehow seen her manuscript and plundered it.

His very fecundity - sexual and literary - serves by juxtaposition to highlight Deeks's heroic tenacity. McKillop's description of the trials, his convincing lists of mirror phrases and his rehabilitation of Deeks all demonstrate how unscrupulous the literary world can be.

From 425BC to the beginning of the 20th century there is an averting of eyes. Silence.\" This is a slight exaggeration. The silence was disturbed by a few 19th-century travellers, but the emphasis was less on terrain than on people encountered. It is only with the publication in 1901 of John C Van Dyke's masterpiece The Desert that \"the weird solitude, the great silence, the grim desolation\" come to be seen as manifestations of the sublime. Significantly, Van Dyke - who is not mentioned in this book, even though it shares his title - was an art historian; in the 20th century, the idea of desert and its visual representation have proved inversely fertile to the aridity of the subject. As Don DeLillo puts it in The Names , \"The desert fits the screen. It is the screen.\" </p> <p>Accompanying an exhibition at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, this book showcases some artists who have used photography and film to frame or contain the emptiness of the desert. The project was inspired by French film-maker/ photographer/journalist Raymond Depardon and the book opens with the transcription of an interview with him. Later there's an interview with Wilfred Thesiger. These two dusty celebrities are intermittently interesting, but interviews are poor substitutes for the measured contemplation of prose. Why didn't they write something? And why didn't someone persuade historian of photography Mounira Khemir not to? Either she can't write or her translators can't translate. \"The question is, then, is to take a photograph of the desert to live differently in space, carry fragments or a trace of memory?\" Sorry, I didn't quite follow that. </p> <p>After a couple of pages of this heartfelt nonsense it comes as a relief to turn to Paul Virilio, a thinker for whom sense long ago reached escape velocity. Anyone who has wondered if Virilio and Jean Baudrillard are actually one and the same - or, to use the idiom, simulacra of one another - will have their suspicions confirmed here. In Death Valley, readers of America may recall, Baudrillard was entranced by \"the silence of the whole of this heat over the mineral expanses that stretch out before us for hundreds of miles, the silence of the gentle wind . . .\" For Virilio \"the silence is an expansive affair: the mineral silence of the soil or the silence of the sky, everything is silent and for ever\". It's not plagiarism, but it's not very original either. Reliant on a discursive software badly in need of updating, Virilio's histrionic babble about the \"desertification\" of this, that and the other seems more like a symptom of the desertification of contemporary French thought. </p> <p>These texts are complemented by banal artworks drawing on some of Depardon's photos by Titouan Lamazou and an adolescent collage by Lara Baladi. Far better are the cool, gimmick-free photographs of hot places by William Eggleston and Balthasar Burkhard. Most remarkable of all are the 19th- and early 20th-century photos of Algeria and Egypt by Emile Frechon, John Beasley Greene and others. In these images the abiding sense, as a character in Antonioni's The Passenger says when confronted by a sea of sand, is of \"a kind of waiting\". At the time they were taken they showed a landscape alien to traditional pictorial aesthetics; over time, they have acquired the silence of the space depicted. </p> <p>Whatever the quality of individual images, the book lacks the conceptual coherence of, for example, Perpetual Mirage , an exhibition and book that traced the developing tradition of \"Photographic narratives of the Desert West\". It is also diminished by some glaring omissions: the failure to include images from Richard Misrach's ongoing Desert Cantos series is akin to excluding Mapplethorpe from a survey of gay photography. If the sepia photographs of pyramids from the 1870s had been complemented by Lynn Davis's stunning contemporary images of Giza, we would have seen how the timeless ages and the changeless changes. </p> <p>Also notable by its absence is the most important artistic/cultural event in the history of the desert: the annual Burning Man festival in Nevada (photographed by Misrach in 1991). The editors have included one of Michael Light's digitally enhanced Nasa images of the lunar desert from his Full Moon project; what is not mentioned is that the full sequence was first exhibited on the night of the full moon at Burning Man 1998, arranged in the form of a 175ft landing strip. The centrepiece was a 1:1 scale image of the surface of the moon; effectively, the lunar desert was imprinted on the Black Rock Desert. A more graphic demonstration of the book's theme - the elision of the actual and photographed desert - is hard to imagine.

Like his forefathers, he scratches a meagre living from the soil: furrowing the fields with his fingernails, pulling puny loads of produce to market on a one-wheeled cart bound to the throat of a straining horse. The horses don't survive long, and neither do the villagers: though they pray fervently to God and spit to ward off evil spirits, they daren't name their children until they achieve their first birthdays. Then, one day, Yves invents the harness, and \"the present as we know it began\". </p> <p>To the modern eye, the consequences of Yves's breakthrough unfold with the inevitability of hindsight: bigger carts, paved roads, the joys of speed and purposeless driving, for which Yves must invent a new name: \"Pass-Time\". And although this feels like a time-travel narrative, one of us soon steps into the tale: a young American anthropologist, the \"editor\" of Yves's testament. Ruth Blum has grown up with stories of the mythical Mandragora (its dreamlike name a nod to the narcotic powers of the mandrake root), a rumoured hamlet on an island off the coast of Scotland, \"tucked like an egg in the middle of a nest of mountains\" and undiscovered by the modern world. As she breathes with wonder when she hikes into the annual village fete, with her immodest clothes and shockingly white teeth, \"a tumour . . . all reds and purples like raucous spring flowers, and sprouting everywhere shiny protuberances and black tendrils\" on her back: \"They're having a Renaissance fair, only they're not.\" </p> <p>Yves is extremely relieved when Ruth takes the cancerous rucksack off, and, ignoring the villagers' misapprehensions, invites her into his home (where she stares about so, he assumes she's never seen a house before). There she begins her study of pre-industrial society. Yet despite her determination not to \"mess with my data set\", her unwitting hints of brakes and double axles threaten to develop her thesis subject out of existence, and an unsettling love affair blossoms in her footnotes to Yves's text. Meanwhile, \"the Beyond\" comes calling in the shape of a crashed airplane and the US soldiers sent to investigate its disappearance. </p> <p>Barton ploughs rich comic material from Ruth's unwonted toast and toothpaste, while Yves's wondering narrative allows her to bring a delightfully fresh eye to the accustomed marvels of the modern world: a photograph \"a wafer bearing a remarkable likeness\", a tape recorder a loaf of bread \"with the gentle whir of a distant mill wheel\". As Ruth realises to her shame, she is as unable to explain our technology as Yves is to comprehend it. The villagers, of course, study Ruth too: Yves's brother Mandrik, a holy man and the only Mandragorian to have travelled, begins a treatise on the broken postlapsarian language of the stranger, with its \"sharp bursts\", ubiquitous umming and phatic repetition, and draws grave conclusions about the state of her soul. </p> <p>It's remarkable that The Testament of Yves Gundron is only a first novel. Barton effortlessly combines a numinously convincing recreation of peasant society and a sci-fi sensibility for cultural conflict with a delicate fable of the Fall, as Yves takes us from the time of his grandfather's grandfather, \"when the darkness was newly separated from the light\", to his first awful realisation that his life has \"somehow ceased to be enough\". Yet this is also a surprisingly suspenseful page-turner; as \"the future rushes forward to devour us\" and it becomes gradually clear that Mandrik has been less than truthful about his travels in the Beyond, Barton's narrative gusto speeds the reader with ease past some hard-to-take twists in the tall tale, and she invests the inevitable conclusion with a nicely judged ambiguity. </p> <p>Her imaginative daring extends to the playful rhythms of the villagers' parlance, cries of \"yo\", \"land, schmand\" and extempore blues ditties scattered among their quasi- King James Bible speech. There's also a most unfashionable reverence in Yves's worshipful prose, his language imbued with love for both the natural world around him and the visionary realm of loss and regret. Rich in emotional depth and intellectual curiosity, this generous, strangely ego-free novel finds sweetness and clarity in \"that state of affairs we had never known to call Peace\".</p>",

Barton ploughs rich comic material from Ruth's unwonted toast and toothpaste, while Yves's wondering narrative allows her to bring a delightfully fresh eye to the accustomed marvels of the modern world: a photograph \"a wafer bearing a remarkable likeness\", a tape recorder a loaf of bread \"with the gentle whir of a distant mill wheel\". As Ruth realises to her shame, she is as unable to explain our technology as Yves is to comprehend it. The villagers, of course, study Ruth too: Yves's brother Mandrik, a holy man and the only Mandragorian to have travelled, begins a treatise on the broken postlapsarian language of the stranger, with its \"sharp bursts\", ubiquitous umming and phatic repetition, and draws grave conclusions about the state of her soul. It's remarkable that The Testament of Yves Gundron is only a first novel. Barton effortlessly combines a numinously convincing recreation of peasant society and a sci-fi sensibility for cultural conflict with a delicate fable of the Fall, as Yves takes us from the time of his grandfather's grandfather, \"when the darkness was newly separated from the light\", to his first awful realisation that his life has \"somehow ceased to be enough\". Yet this is also a surprisingly suspenseful page-turner; as \"the future rushes forward to devour us\" and it becomes gradually clear that Mandrik has been less than truthful about his travels in the Beyond, Barton's narrative gusto speeds the reader with ease past some hard-to-take twists in the tall tale, and she invests the inevitable conclusion with a nicely judged ambiguity. Her imaginative daring extends to the playful rhythms of the villagers' parlance, cries of \"yo\", \"land, schmand\" and extempore blues ditties scattered among their quasi- King James Bible speech. There's also a most unfashionable reverence in Yves's worshipful prose, his language imbued with love for both the natural world around him and the visionary realm of loss and regret. Rich in emotional depth and intellectual curiosity, this generous, strangely ego-free novel finds sweetness and clarity in \"that state of affairs we had never known to call Peace\".",

For today's thirty- or fortysomething male it's a foreign country, where they do things differently, but - disconcertingly - not all that differently. Coe's novel feels autobiographical. I very much hope Toby Litt's isn't. </p> <p>Gangs of four are at the heart of both. Litt's book is about a quasi-military outfit in a fictional middle-England village, Amplewick; its troops go by the stoutly Anglican names of Andrew, Paul, Matthew and Peter. These teenage lads, encouraged by Andrew's creepy and abusive father, \"the Major-General\", fantasise about resisting the Russkies' invasion and go on increasingly sinister and fanatical manoeuvres. They're all blond and call themselves Gang, without the definite article, which has an icily Germanic ring. </p> <p>Coe's bunch are much less disturbing. Trotter, Harding, Anderton and Chase are the precocious, school-uniform-wearing, Oxbridge-material heroes at the independent \"King William's School\" in Birmingham. They progress much further than Gang into late adolescence, a period more amenable to bitter-sweet comedy. They form bands; they co-edit the school magazine; they get hung up about girls. To borrow a comparison from boys' books, Toby Litt's Aryan Gang looks like a droogish clone of Richmal Crompton's William and his Outlaws, in that their internal code of rank and precedence has nothing to do with school, where they are hardly ever seen. When Andrew leads his followers on one of their missions, he is seen \"thrashing at stray stalks with a stick he'd picked up\" - pure William. Coe's boys are more like sophisticated, knowing versions of characters from the pages of Ronald Searle and Geoffrey Willans or Anthony Buckeridge. For them, school is everything. It provides the culture and the weather of the novel: a benignly privileged institution represented largely without irony or even criticism. </p> <p> Deadkidsongs is about as far as it could be from the hip cosmopolitan sophistication of Litt's previous book, Corpsing . With its solidity and substance and its feel for the English countryside, it reads almost like a classroom classic itself. Litt has always been a smart writer, but deadkidsongs shows signs of something more than that. There is an effortless felicity in his prose, and a discreetly happy invention in almost every sentence. But the inflections of comedy and fun have been bleached out of his writing in favour of something much darker, tauter and more unsparing. Litt's Gang, with their fierce F\u00fchrerprinzip , their casual acquaintance with death and their unwholesome indifference to the outside world, have created their own desert island, comparable to William Golding's in Lord of the Flies . But what makes it more disturbing is that it is far from impervious to adult influence. On the contrary, Gang's dysfunction and murderous fanaticism are licensed and directed by the grown-up world, in the form of Andrew's father - known as \"the Best Father\". Deadkidsongs is not merely an essay on the dark heart of childhood, but on the dark heart of adulthood too. </p> <p>Where deadkidsongs is uncertain is in its structure. Ostensibly a \"found\" manuscript discovered by one of Gang's future sons, the novel comprises not just a fragment from its earnest typewritten archive but conventional omniscient narration from the points of view of different Gang members in turn, sometimes in the first person, sometimes in the third. It is not easy to see how all this technique has materialised in the form of the \"500 sheets of going-brown A4 paper\", and it slightly diminishes the documentary immediacy that Litt appears to be aiming at. Moreover, in its closing pages it appears to be striving for a sweeter, more empathetic insight into boyhood than is altogether plausible, given the horror and alienation of all that has gone before. But Andrew is certainly a compelling character, who in his tiny megalomania reminded me irresistibly of General Woundwort in Watership Down . </p> <p>Jonathan Coe's genial, likeable novel can only be described as a kind of lit-prog-rock concept album: the concept in question being what it was like to be a talented adolescent at a prestigious boys' school in the 1970s, and heavily into appalling bands like Yes and Gentle Giant. In fact, it's the first half of a double gatefold album: Coe is in the studio now recording a sequel to The Rotters' Club , which brings all the characters up to date in the early 21st century. </p> <p>Coe recreates the period with such loving accuracy that I frankly suspect him of having planted a secret microphone in the tin Oxford Mathematical Instruments box I carried around in my school days. Without recourse to the clich\u00e9s of Spacehoppers and flares, he provides lots of horribly authentic detail: \"he was carrying his books and his PE kit in the same bulky sports bag, from which the handle of his squash racket protruded like a permanently erect penis\". </p> <p>Coe is often praised for combining anger and amiability. But despite the fact that the book includes some of the grimmest news from that dire decade, there's a weird dominance of amiability here - a sort of McCartney without the Lennon. His protagonist, Ben Trotter, claims that he is always missing the big events, having slipped out to make a cup of tea at key moments. But this is disingenuous. Coe contrives to give him a ringside seat at all the big historical crises - the pub bombings, British Leyland - as well as at lots of pop-culture high points. He's the opposite of the teen hero of Julian Barnes's Metroland , who goes to Paris in 1968 and gormlessly fails to notice any riots. In fact, Coe cheats with retrospective wisdom. There is much arch comment from Harding, the class joker, about the corruption of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad - but this only became common knowledge much later. An awful moment comes when Miriam, a sexy young secretary, gets into trouble with union boss Bill Anderton, runs away and vanishes. Her fate will presumably be disclosed in the next book - is it too late to dissuade Coe from sending her to 25 Cromwell Street, Cheltenham? </p> <p>Unlike his dissection of the 1980s, What a Carve Up! , there is no very obvious anger, scorn or political perspective in the book. In fact, there is something strangely equable in Coe's tone as the long parade of ghastliness passes by, in background and foreground, an odd parallel to the mawkish teenage outpourings. Well, the personal is political, so the sting in the tail presumably comes in the sequel, when his boys have grown up. </p> <p>It's a long time to wait. But as always with Jonathan Coe, the sheer intelligent good nature that suffuses his work makes it a pleasure to read. Perhaps Litt's book has more visceral power - but Coe's, with its embarrassments and comic vanities, is closer to what being a boy is actually like.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Earl's Court's a funny place to live. It used to be all itinerant Aussies and gays, with the street life to match. Nowadays, its citizens are either the senior sort who got lucky with the 60s rent-control system or thirtysomething European bankers. Not what you'd call an area manifesting much in the way of community spirit. Jonathan Coe lives here because he was priced out of Chelsea and eased westwards before his novels took off and put him into the VAT-registered income bracket, which is a rare distinction for any writer. Ask me about it. </p> <p>Anyway, these are the streets he walks every day from the basement flat where his loved ones are, between dead-faced Edwardian houses and parked BMWs to the anonymous office complex where he rents a space in which to have a bit of a think, catch up on admin, that sort of thing. It takes about 10 minutes, the stroll, and, as usual, it's raining. He doesn't have an umbrella, just a long, dark-coloured overcoat that makes him look even longer than he is, which is long. Long and singular and solitary and awesomely self-contained. </p> <p>Come to think of it, he suits Earl's Court. They're stately, the pair of them, otherworldly yet structurally sound and nice to look at. I'd describe Coe as somewhere between handsome and beautiful, except there's something weird going on in the retinal vicinity, a slight distortion of the pupils, perhaps, and between the eyes this deep indentation suggesting a lifelong sense of perplexity. Then, too, someone has given him a sort of pre-adolescent's pudding-bowl haircut, so that every so often you get a flash of an etiolated pixie who's strayed from the enchanted forest and is feeling a tad edgy about getting back in. At all events, we're not talking run-of-the-mill here. </p> <p>For want of something better to say, I'd been bitching all the way there about his latest narrator and why he keeps whingeing on about being a narrator. Apologising for it. What kind of question's that, I said, \"Does narrative have a purpose?\" He crossed the road without signalling, so I had to scamper to catch up. \"You might as well ask does breathing?\" I nagged. </p> <p>He didn't answer, just looked sideways for a second and made a rushing sound through his nose, which is Coe for laughing. It turned out he's one of those literary blokes who wanders about a room picking up books and referring to them all the time. Hence, once out of the rain, he fished out an old BS Johnson, riffled confidently to the desired page and left me with it for 15 minutes. </p> <p>It is a memoir regarded as highly innovative in the late 60s called Aren't You Rather Young To Be Writing Your Memoirs? in deference to those who felt that such soul-searching must be the preserve of older gentlemen. On page 35 or thereabouts, Johnson torments himself with the potential destructiveness, if not downright wickedness, of the business of storytelling. He is not interested, he writes, in telling lies. (An admirer of Joyce and Beckett, what he did write was experimental novels using such innovative techniques as holes in the page and diagrammatic type.) Johnson quotes his friend, the poet Philip Pacey: \"Telling stories is telling lies about people... is creating or hardening prejudices... is providing an alternative to real communication and/or communication itself... is an escape from the challenge of coming to terms with real people.\" For a novelist who had never heard of virtual reality, or even of internets, these are pretty hard words. </p> <p>Burn all the books and jack it all in, I wondered when Coe came back with some rather horrid coffee. Which turned out to be somewhat tactless, as Mr Johnson apparently did away with himself a couple of years after he had delivered himself of this particular spate of self-interrogative nihilism. At age 39, put his affairs in order and cut his wrists in the bath. The Roman style. Why? God knows why. Why does anyone, ever? Coe doesn't know, and doesn't expect to know, dig and delve as he most certainly will. It's just that Johnson's authorised biography is his for the writing, and these precious questions have a way of preying on an open mind. </p> <p>Subscribe or not, it's a respectable issue. It so happens that Coe does not agree with these despairing sentiments - neither the belief that storytelling is no better than lying nor the impulse to suicide. He doesn't imagine readers hurl novels across rooms because they suspect that what they're reading is not literally true. There's a pact involved, as he sees it. You invite someone along while you tell your story - or your lies - and you mould narrative shapes in order to get at the more universal truth. And while you're doing that, you have to ask yourself why you're doing it and what manner of moral exercise you're engaged in. Things don't have to be literally true, so long as they are true in their component parts. If you see what he means. And you won't achieve that truth if you stop flagellating yourself with your own perfidy. Which Johnson didn't. And why Coe admires him so much. Meanwhile, he's holding on to the eternal verity that people are consoled by patterns imposed on life - or art, as we pretentiously call it - because our lives are such ghastly chaos. </p> <p>When Coe's magnum opus, the impertinently titled What A Carve Up! was published in 1994 - his fourth published novel, but the first to be panoramic in ambition and noticeable in impact - literary critics uniformly raved about its brilliance, its sociological and political acuity and its general, all-round hilarity. Not that they did him much good. It was a full year before the novel began to sell, and then by word of mouth - recognised as the book that put the definitive boot into the 80s and Thatcherism. Meanwhile, Coe was installed, much to his astonishment, as our very own prince of postmodernism. Whatever that means, ism-wise. Considering the load of faux fin de si\u00e8cle intellectual maundering that coined the term, you'd expect it to suggest a sort of canonic revolution or disintegration, a merry heralding of an anything-goes, whoopsadaisy brave new genre where there are no longer any value systems, nobody comes over all judgmental, and high and low cultures are either the same or they cancel each other out. When Coe thought about his new label, he decided to wear it with good grace. He could be postmodern in form, yes, and arse about with farce, pastiche, larky allusion and so forth, while smuggling in his own brand of 19th-century moralism and Puritanism by way of content. He could live with that. </p> <p>Considering the autobiographic nature of the burden of his work, Coe is strangely reticent about his background. His mother and father are alive and well and living in the home he grew up in and have done absolutely nothing to court anyone's attention. It wouldn't be fair... but then, neither is having a writer in the family fair. So he was born in 1961 in a leafy suburb of Birmingham, best described by Tolkien as Hobbiton across the water. A nice, civilised, three-bedroomed house brought to maximum grace by the addition of a fourth, strictly unnecessary apartment annexed to the space over the garage. </p> <p>He was brought up, he says, in the wishy-washy Church of England ethic, which is to say no ethic at all, or, if it is, then one so lacking in any kind of moral framework that it doesn't count. As a small boy he imbibed, as small boys do, whatever was in the ether - he accompanied his mother to church without protest and had he been old enough to vote, which thank goodness he wasn't, he'd have voted Tory, along with this father. </p> <p>If politics was ever discussed at home or in the homes of his friends, it came across as a kind of unquestioning endorsement of Edward Heath's one-nation conservatism, while socialism and the unions were merely threats to the nation's prosperity posed by loony lefties. Middle-middle-class stuff, you understand. The sort of people who also believe that Margaret Thatcher is the greatest prime minister since Mr Churchill and that Enoch Powell was only saying out loud what we all think. People - the salt of the earth - who rejoice in a hierarchic civilisation where everyone has the discipline and good sense to be properly guided by their betters. So when Roll-up Reg wanders in to the latest Coe novel and asks the hero if he's \"that Tory cunt\", he concedes quite amiably that, yes, he probably is, since there's no point in being defensive about what was once part of you and cannot be changed. </p> <p>\"Are you that Tory cunt?\" Coe says dreamily, as though he's only just remembered it. \"Good old Reg.\" Things imbibed as a boy do not necessarily mark you for life, and besides, he was in a world of his own most of the time, upstairs in his room doing his homework, reading Flann O'Brien and listening to quirky instrumental rock albums put out under the Richard Branson label. </p> <p>Theirs was not a literary household. He can remember the yellow spines of some kind of crime series being around the place, his grandmother got through two or three Mills &amp; Boons a week, his mother favoured Agatha Christie and his father liked Arthur Haley and thinks to this day that Jeffrey Archer is the greatest novelist in the English language. His maternal grandfather, however, a fellow of liberal leanings, introduced him to his own favourites, PG Wodehouse and Conan Doyle, as soon as he could read, so that at the age of eight he could, had you been there, be seen sitting in the awning of the family caravan parked by the North Wales coastline, writing his first novel in a little notebook. </p> <p>He has a copy of it here, neatly typed up by his dad's secretary, circa 1969, for which labour he now devoutly hopes she was handsomely paid. There are exactly 180 pages of it, but here's a line: \" 'I'm getting exceptionally bored,' pronounced Jason.\" I didn't read any more, but Coe assured me that it's a pretty stylish marriage of Doyle and Wodehouse, if you've got the patience to go on with it. </p> <p>Anyway, he lapped up Sherlock Holmes and everything by Wodehouse until school took the edge off his reading pleasure. He began to sense that they were not, after all, \"the canon\". Not that he knew the word at the time. He simply began to sense the difference between what gave him joy and what he was supposed to read in order to better himself. The \"canon\", therefore, was what they made him read: To Kill A Mockingbird, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, books presented as serious and worthy, books to teach you something important about which you would later be examined. It put the dampers on things for him, rather as later he discovered that reviewing other people's books makes you forget what it's like to read for joy. </p> <p>But he did his homework like the good, clever little schoolboy he was, got to the posh grammar school and then rediscovered the mischievous, romping, outlandish, slightly subversive undertow that had drawn him to Wodehouse in the work of television scriptwriters: Galton and Simpson, Le Frenais, Dick Clement, John Cleese, the great 70s cock-snookers. And this time his taste was shared by all other boys. \"People forget about the 1970s,\" Coe writes in The Rotters' Club, which does for that decade, albeit in a less ferocious way, what What A Carve Up! did for the 80s. \"They think it was all about wide collars, and glam rock and they get nostalgic about Fawlty Towers and kid's TV programmes and they forget the ungodly strangeness of it.\" </p> <p>Or, come to that, the ungodly strangeness of being a growing boy in any decade. In the light of its past-historic authenticity, it is all too easy to perceive our aforementioned hero, Benjamin Trotter, known to his peers as Bent - Bent Rotter (geddit) - as the moulded image of Jonathan Coe, near as dammit. The man himself is fairly accommodating about this assumption, which has been applied to all his novels, barring the one with a heroine and the first to be published, The Accidental Woman, which he now repudiates as \"too cruel\". </p> <p>You have only to say, hey, was that you in A Touch Of Love, holed up in a bedsit having a depressive breakdown and going ballistic over a flat-pack of sausages and mash because it had a photo on the wrapping of a knife, fork and plate containing half sausages and half mash, just that, and underneath the caption \"Serving suggestions\"? Because when I read it I was on a train between Cambridge and King's Cross and it caused me to suffer attacks of catalepsy in front of all the mobile phone users. And he says, yes, that was him, except his had been the most minute and laughable of breakdowns. </p> <p>All that happened was he didn't get out of bed for a few days because when he did get up he kept falling over and crashing into things. He'd put food into the oven and forget to turn the oven on, things like that, which was how he came to be examining the packet in the first place. It was just that his PhD wasn't writing itself and he was being a bit irrational because, after all, if they'd put a sprig of parsley and a dollop of beans in the picture by way of \"serving suggestions\", people like him would ring them up and ask where their parsley and beans had got to. </p> <p>Or you can ask: was that you in The Rotters' Club, the schoolboy so crazed with fear of being seen naked that you prayed to God for deliverance and He was moved to fling a wet pair of bathers into your orbit. Yes and no. There was no such epiphanous moment, he says, and besides, he's an atheist. But the fear was true. They had this rule at school that if a boy forgot to bring his swimming trunks for swimming lessons, he'd be made to swim naked. This wasn't so much authoritarian sadism as a rule to persuade boys to remember their kit. It wouldn't have been an ordeal to be seen naked if everyone else was; it was just that if it was only one set of genitals in the pool and those genitals chanced to be your own, you'd pretty well wish for death to come before the mockery. </p> <p>That's what it's like at the sort of highly academic, highly competitive school he went to. There's no physical bullying at all; the way to get one over on another boy is through sharp and devastating verbal stuff. To a schoolboy of this ilk, everything is good for a laugh, especially, they all believe, their own sexuality, and since they have yet to distinguish between ego and id, their penises and their immortal souls, the best - the most relieving - thing they can do is to project their worst-nightmare scenarios on to each other. </p> <p>Which brings us to the matter of Dickie's Bag. There are two Richards in Bent's year, one is black and known wittily as Rastus. The other, for reasons more profoundly rooted in the fear of the unknown, they insist on calling Dickie. There is nothing intrinsically disturbing about Dickie. He isn't effete or macho, nor is there anything about his bag to distinguish it from any other boy's bag. They all have similarly featureless holdalls to carry their books about; blue, black, brown, nothing fancy. Anyway, for unfathomable reasons, Dickie's bag is unanimously elected as a sort of sex object. Every morning, as Dickie hoves into view, the cry goes go up, \"Dickie's Bag! Dickie's Bag!\" And the whole bunch of them fall upon the luckless receptacle and hump the daylights out of it. </p> <p>Coe nearly smiles at the memory. It was true, yes. He recently met a man he hadn't seen for 22 years and found it difficult talking with him after all that time until he mentioned Dickie's bag. What can he say? It was just something they did. They humped the bag and it kind of set them up for the day. Did he join in? Of course he joined in. The whole point of the exercise was that it was collective. Collective, sublime and incomprehensible, as all schoolboy humour is. He went a bit shifty-eyed then and swivelled his focus around the floor until his eye fell upon my bag, a rather fine carpet number much admired by taxi-drivers, lying open and vulnerable with all its used tissues and fag packets showing. \"No,\" he says drily. \"Not my type.\" </p> <p>It is an uncharacteristic moment of levity. Coe is courteous, painstakingly truthful, co-operative and generous, but he is not a man to demean himself by courting a cheap laugh. I've often noticed that about people who are funny for a living; it's as though the other side of the coin of anarchy - which is what funny's all about - the one they front up with, is an abiding gravity, a wall of diffidence five feet thick that you'd be ill-advised to try to penetrate. All his narrators have this kind of withdrawn, hesitant quality. </p> <p>I had to ask. Was that you lurking at the open door to watch daft, fat Joan sprawled naked on her bed? The man who covertly marvelled at the staggering beauty of her body, but then, when she said something matey like, \"Aren't you coming in then?\", turned and tippy-toed silently away? </p> <p>No, he says. He made it up. Yet he cannot tell a lie. If he hadn't made it up, if it had really happened then, yes, he'd have skipped off. \"Men say to me, come on, any man in that situation would have been in like Flynn, but my impression - and maybe this is just the kind of friends I have gathered around myself - is that people aren't nearly as sexually confident or assertive as they portray themselves, or as they are portrayed in 95% of fiction. The truth is, there is nothing more frightening than a huge, succulent girl lying naked on a bed saying Come On In. Nothing. No. Really...\" </p> <p>He is in earnest. \"Men,\" he says, solemn as a polytechnic sociology tutor, \"have been disenfranchised by the sexual politics of the past 20 years. Much as Old Labour voters don't have anywhere to put themselves any more. The options offered by our culture, or the media, or whatever you want to call it, are New Lad and New Man. And neither really exists. New Lad is hedonistic, emotionally ruthless, uncommitted, full of bravado. New Man is emotionally, comically conscientious and domesticated. One would leap on Joan, the other tiptoe away. It's a pathetic choice.\" </p> <p>A typical victim of male disenfranchisement would be Robert, the poor sod in The House Of Sleep who gets in such a sweat getting in touch with his other gender self that he winds up having a sex change. Which is clearly neither true of the author, nor any kind of stab at social realism. But it is a metaphor. We get nurtured, for all we know against our nature, to be acceptable, attractive members of our sex, then when we fail to find nirvana we re-nurture ourselves, and - in extremis, turn to the other absurdity. And that doesn't work, either. It's nothing to laugh at. </p> <p>Coe had written three unpublished novels - four if you include the Jason oeuvre when he was eight - by the time he was 25. It was then he took a violent dislike to all his male protagonists and decided, in a purely literary sense, to change sex. The Accidental Woman (for it was she) wrenched \u00a3200 from the publishers Duckworth and became, he says, the literary non-event of the 80s. But it broke, as it were, his duck. He remembers what it was like back then, living in a bedsit in Coventry, sending off the Jiffy bag and getting it back with the rejection slip over and over again. He kept them. Sometimes, he gets them out and reads them again. </p> <p>At the time, they failed to daunt; in fact, they came as terribly thrilling missives from the throbbing head of literary London. He knows now they're just stock phrases that publishers dash off a hundred times a day, but back then \"shows promise\" or \"we'd be interested in your next effort\" told him that he existed, that he was a contender. He remembers getting a rejection slip from Punch for a short story. It was just the standard thing, except that someone had written, in handwriting, \"Thanks\" at the bottom. It was like a beaker of water, he says, to a thirsty man. </p> <p>Encouraged, he moved to a shared dump in Bermondsey and set about A Touch Of Love, for which Duckworth doubled its ante. Coe, meanwhile, had already embarked on his own personal sentimental journey, a trip that strangely exemplifies the promise that life will imitate art if you take both of these things seriously. </p> <p>In the mid-80s, you'll recall, people read Amis and Barnes and Ishiguro et al, and Coe was no exception to this rule. His own God, however - the writer of whom he actually pronounces the word \"Phew!\" - is Alasdair Gray. The first Gray to strike him in the solar plexus (\"And this is quite odd, actually,\" he understates) was called 1982, Janine. It was a novel about the Thatcher years and one night in the life of a deeply depressed man confronting the cock-up he made of his life. Janine is the fantasy figure he creates to take his mind off the loss of the love of his life. In other words, she is the great sex symbol, the redeemer of the great inconsolable cataclysm in the hearts of man. The woman. </p> <p>And then Coe met Janine. I mean, that was her name. So, in 1987, Janine. Coe was keeping body and soul together by working part-time in the Dickensian office of a firm of solicitors, proof-reading legal documents. It was an ideal job for a novelist in that it was so mind-numbingly boring it didn't sap your imaginative juices, so you'd be feeling quite creatively spry by the time you got back to your Oliver portable. Meanwhile, the other side of his desk, Janine was similarly employed, unaware of the significance of her Christian name. </p> <p>They developed a modus operandi in order to stay awake. He'd read a lease aloud to her, putting in all the punctuation marks and capitalisations, then she'd do the same back. This went on for six months. Call it a courtship. \"It was strange,\" he says in his enigmatic way. \"There was all this talking going on, but not about anything. Just a lot of noise being made.\" No shades of Joan, then? There were, he concedes, \"textural factors\". The office began a thing where people went for a drink together after work and, yes, he asked her out and, yes, they married. Suffice it to say that the dedication of What A Carve Up! reads \"1994, Janine\", and subsequent novels have extended their dedications to Janine and Matilda and to Janine and Matilda and Madeline. And that Alasdair Gray, when Coe eventually met his hero, vowed to pulp 1982, Janine if anything went wrong with their marriage. </p> <p>Fatherhood was not a place he entered without trepidation. He had thought he would never have children, he has almost forgotten why. When you think that it's a choice you can make, that's the problem: you think about it. He thought he had parent's block the way other people have writer's block. The simple fact was that he was scared. He'd grown up, or rather not grown up, believing himself to be clever and funny, as if that was enough to be going on with. And it's not. Clever and funny doesn't come close. It equips you, maybe, to be a comic novelist, not an adult male. So he stopped thinking about it. Now that his daughters have been born, he realises he wasn't wrong. But then, he didn't know, either, what he was made of. You don't until you've lived with a three-year-old, plumbed the depths of your reserves of energy and generosity, found strengths in yourself you never dreamt you had. You grow up. </p> <p>And this is the easy bit. A small child is a lunatic, there's no doubt about it. They're nuts. \"I mean,\" he says, \"what can you do when the tantrum's because the imaginary friend hasn't called round when they promised they would? You're in the realm of the deeply irrational, but it's a kind of a relief to be in that realm for a while, knowing that terrible, earth-shattering disappointment is only in the head. It's a dismal thought that it's going to become rational later on.\" </p> <p>There is no end to catastrophic expectation for any of us, it seems. At the end of The Rotters' Club, Coe has written a sentence that goes on for 15,000 words, which will doubtless be featured in the next edition of the Guinness Book Of Records. As a triumph of form over content it has to be seen to be believed. Coe is fairly sanguine about it. He reckons the content dictated the form. Had Bent not won the girl of his dreams? Had Mrs Thatcher not been elected to lead our benighted country? Do these twin dramas not merit the odd stylistic firework? And, besides, there's a Czech writer who once wrote a whole novel with nary a full stop. So how's that for clever and funny? </p> <p>Coe is already working on a sequel to The Rotters' Club, which will leap forward to the 90s, so putting paid to the 20th century - or rather his treatment of the last three decades of it. This afternoon he will listen to BS Johnson's tapes on the big, 50s tape-recorder. Johnson recorded everything, as luck has it. Dinner parties, conversations with his friends, everything. And then? He'd prefer not to contemplate what comes next. \"How do you write a novel about global warming?\" he says. And answers himself. \"You can't. It's too big. The tools just don't do the job. You can't get your head round it.\" </p> <p>He will.</p> <p>\u0095 The Rotters' Club is published by Viking at \u00a314.99</p> <p>\u0095 Jonathan Coe will be live online on Guardian Unlimited, Books, at 3pm on March 8.

      "bodyText": "Earl's Court's a funny place to live. It used to be all itinerant Aussies and gays, with the street life to match. Nowadays, its citizens are either the senior sort who got lucky with the 60s rent-control system or thirtysomething European bankers. Not what you'd call an area manifesting much in the way of community spirit. Jonathan Coe lives here because he was priced out of Chelsea and eased westwards before his novels took off and put him into the VAT-registered income bracket, which is a rare distinction for any writer. Ask me about it. Anyway, these are the streets he walks every day from the basement flat where his loved ones are, between dead-faced Edwardian houses and parked BMWs to the anonymous office complex where he rents a space in which to have a bit of a think, catch up on admin, that sort of thing. It takes about 10 minutes, the stroll, and, as usual, it's raining. He doesn't have an umbrella, just a long, dark-coloured overcoat that makes him look even longer than he is, which is long. Long and singular and solitary and awesomely self-contained. Come to think of it, he suits Earl's Court. They're stately, the pair of them, otherworldly yet structurally sound and nice to look at. I'd describe Coe as somewhere between handsome and beautiful, except there's something weird going on in the retinal vicinity, a slight distortion of the pupils, perhaps, and between the eyes this deep indentation suggesting a lifelong sense of perplexity. Then, too, someone has given him a sort of pre-adolescent's pudding-bowl haircut, so that every so often you get a flash of an etiolated pixie who's strayed from the enchanted forest and is feeling a tad edgy about getting back in. At all events, we're not talking run-of-the-mill here. For want of something better to say, I'd been bitching all the way there about his latest narrator and why he keeps whingeing on about being a narrator. Apologising for it. What kind of question's that, I said, \"Does narrative have a purpose?\" He crossed the road without signalling, so I had to scamper to catch up. \"You might as well ask does breathing?\" I nagged. He didn't answer, just looked sideways for a second and made a rushing sound through his nose, which is Coe for laughing. It turned out he's one of those literary blokes who wanders about a room picking up books and referring to them all the time. Hence, once out of the rain, he fished out an old BS Johnson, riffled confidently to the desired page and left me with it for 15 minutes. It is a memoir regarded as highly innovative in the late 60s called Aren't You Rather Young To Be Writing Your Memoirs? in deference to those who felt that such soul-searching must be the preserve of older gentlemen. On page 35 or thereabouts, Johnson torments himself with the potential destructiveness, if not downright wickedness, of the business of storytelling. He is not interested, he writes, in telling lies. (An admirer of Joyce and Beckett, what he did write was experimental novels using such innovative techniques as holes in the page and diagrammatic type.) Johnson quotes his friend, the poet Philip Pacey: \"Telling stories is telling lies about people... is creating or hardening prejudices... is providing an alternative to real communication and/or communication itself... is an escape from the challenge of coming to terms with real people.\" For a novelist who had never heard of virtual reality, or even of internets, these are pretty hard words. Burn all the books and jack it all in, I wondered when Coe came back with some rather horrid coffee. Which turned out to be somewhat tactless, as Mr Johnson apparently did away with himself a couple of years after he had delivered himself of this particular spate of self-interrogative nihilism. At age 39, put his affairs in order and cut his wrists in the bath. The Roman style. Why? God knows why. Why does anyone, ever? Coe doesn't know, and doesn't expect to know, dig and delve as he most certainly will. It's just that Johnson's authorised biography is his for the writing, and these precious questions have a way of preying on an open mind. Subscribe or not, it's a respectable issue. It so happens that Coe does not agree with these despairing sentiments - neither the belief that storytelling is no better than lying nor the impulse to suicide. He doesn't imagine readers hurl novels across rooms because they suspect that what they're reading is not literally true. There's a pact involved, as he sees it. You invite someone along while you tell your story - or your lies - and you mould narrative shapes in order to get at the more universal truth. And while you're doing that, you have to ask yourself why you're doing it and what manner of moral exercise you're engaged in. Things don't have to be literally true, so long as they are true in their component parts. If you see what he means. And you won't achieve that truth if you stop flagellating yourself with your own perfidy. Which Johnson didn't. And why Coe admires him so much. Meanwhile, he's holding on to the eternal verity that people are consoled by patterns imposed on life - or art, as we pretentiously call it - because our lives are such ghastly chaos. When Coe's magnum opus, the impertinently titled What A Carve Up! was published in 1994 - his fourth published novel, but the first to be panoramic in ambition and noticeable in impact - literary critics uniformly raved about its brilliance, its sociological and political acuity and its general, all-round hilarity. Not that they did him much good. It was a full year before the novel began to sell, and then by word of mouth - recognised as the book that put the definitive boot into the 80s and Thatcherism. Meanwhile, Coe was installed, much to his astonishment, as our very own prince of postmodernism. Whatever that means, ism-wise. Considering the load of faux fin de si\u00e8cle intellectual maundering that coined the term, you'd expect it to suggest a sort of canonic revolution or disintegration, a merry heralding of an anything-goes, whoopsadaisy brave new genre where there are no longer any value systems, nobody comes over all judgmental, and high and low cultures are either the same or they cancel each other out. When Coe thought about his new label, he decided to wear it with good grace. He could be postmodern in form, yes, and arse about with farce, pastiche, larky allusion and so forth, while smuggling in his own brand of 19th-century moralism and Puritanism by way of content. He could live with that. Considering the autobiographic nature of the burden of his work, Coe is strangely reticent about his background. His mother and father are alive and well and living in the home he grew up in and have done absolutely nothing to court anyone's attention. It wouldn't be fair... but then, neither is having a writer in the family fair. So he was born in 1961 in a leafy suburb of Birmingham, best described by Tolkien as Hobbiton across the water. A nice, civilised, three-bedroomed house brought to maximum grace by the addition of a fourth, strictly unnecessary apartment annexed to the space over the garage. He was brought up, he says, in the wishy-washy Church of England ethic, which is to say no ethic at all, or, if it is, then one so lacking in any kind of moral framework that it doesn't count. As a small boy he imbibed, as small boys do, whatever was in the ether - he accompanied his mother to church without protest and had he been old enough to vote, which thank goodness he wasn't, he'd have voted Tory, along with this father. If politics was ever discussed at home or in the homes of his friends, it came across as a kind of unquestioning endorsement of Edward Heath's one-nation conservatism, while socialism and the unions were merely threats to the nation's prosperity posed by loony lefties. Middle-middle-class stuff, you understand. The sort of people who also believe that Margaret Thatcher is the greatest prime minister since Mr Churchill and that Enoch Powell was only saying out loud what we all think. People - the salt of the earth - who rejoice in a hierarchic civilisation where everyone has the discipline and good sense to be properly guided by their betters. So when Roll-up Reg wanders in to the latest Coe novel and asks the hero if he's \"that Tory cunt\", he concedes quite amiably that, yes, he probably is, since there's no point in being defensive about what was once part of you and cannot be changed. \"Are you that Tory cunt?\" Coe says dreamily, as though he's only just remembered it. \"Good old Reg.\" Things imbibed as a boy do not necessarily mark you for life, and besides, he was in a world of his own most of the time, upstairs in his room doing his homework, reading Flann O'Brien and listening to quirky instrumental rock albums put out under the Richard Branson label. Theirs was not a literary household. He can remember the yellow spines of some kind of crime series being around the place, his grandmother got through two or three Mills &amp; Boons a week, his mother favoured Agatha Christie and his father liked Arthur Haley and thinks to this day that Jeffrey Archer is the greatest novelist in the English language. His maternal grandfather, however, a fellow of liberal leanings, introduced him to his own favourites, PG Wodehouse and Conan Doyle, as soon as he could read, so that at the age of eight he could, had you been there, be seen sitting in the awning of the family caravan parked by the North Wales coastline, writing his first novel in a little notebook. He has a copy of it here, neatly typed up by his dad's secretary, circa 1969, for which labour he now devoutly hopes she was handsomely paid. There are exactly 180 pages of it, but here's a line: \" 'I'm getting exceptionally bored,' pronounced Jason.\" I didn't read any more, but Coe assured me that it's a pretty stylish marriage of Doyle and Wodehouse, if you've got the patience to go on with it. Anyway, he lapped up Sherlock Holmes and everything by Wodehouse until school took the edge off his reading pleasure. He began to sense that they were not, after all, \"the canon\". Not that he knew the word at the time. He simply began to sense the difference between what gave him joy and what he was supposed to read in order to better himself. The \"canon\", therefore, was what they made him read: To Kill A Mockingbird, Animal Farm, Lord Of The Flies, books presented as serious and worthy, books to teach you something important about which you would later be examined. It put the dampers on things for him, rather as later he discovered that reviewing other people's books makes you forget what it's like to read for joy. But he did his homework like the good, clever little schoolboy he was, got to the posh grammar school and then rediscovered the mischievous, romping, outlandish, slightly subversive undertow that had drawn him to Wodehouse in the work of television scriptwriters: Galton and Simpson, Le Frenais, Dick Clement, John Cleese, the great 70s cock-snookers. And this time his taste was shared by all other boys. \"People forget about the 1970s,\" Coe writes in The Rotters' Club, which does for that decade, albeit in a less ferocious way, what What A Carve Up! did for the 80s. \"They think it was all about wide collars, and glam rock and they get nostalgic about Fawlty Towers and kid's TV programmes and they forget the ungodly strangeness of it.\" Or, come to that, the ungodly strangeness of being a growing boy in any decade. In the light of its past-historic authenticity, it is all too easy to perceive our aforementioned hero, Benjamin Trotter, known to his peers as Bent - Bent Rotter (geddit) - as the moulded image of Jonathan Coe, near as dammit. The man himself is fairly accommodating about this assumption, which has been applied to all his novels, barring the one with a heroine and the first to be published, The Accidental Woman, which he now repudiates as \"too cruel\". You have only to say, hey, was that you in A Touch Of Love, holed up in a bedsit having a depressive breakdown and going ballistic over a flat-pack of sausages and mash because it had a photo on the wrapping of a knife, fork and plate containing half sausages and half mash, just that, and underneath the caption \"Serving suggestions\"? Because when I read it I was on a train between Cambridge and King's Cross and it caused me to suffer attacks of catalepsy in front of all the mobile phone users. And he says, yes, that was him, except his had been the most minute and laughable of breakdowns. All that happened was he didn't get out of bed for a few days because when he did get up he kept falling over and crashing into things. He'd put food into the oven and forget to turn the oven on, things like that, which was how he came to be examining the packet in the first place. It was just that his PhD wasn't writing itself and he was being a bit irrational because, after all, if they'd put a sprig of parsley and a dollop of beans in the picture by way of \"serving suggestions\", people like him would ring them up and ask where their parsley and beans had got to. Or you can ask: was that you in The Rotters' Club, the schoolboy so crazed with fear of being seen naked that you prayed to God for deliverance and He was moved to fling a wet pair of bathers into your orbit. Yes and no. There was no such epiphanous moment, he says, and besides, he's an atheist. But the fear was true. They had this rule at school that if a boy forgot to bring his swimming trunks for swimming lessons, he'd be made to swim naked. This wasn't so much authoritarian sadism as a rule to persuade boys to remember their kit. It wouldn't have been an ordeal to be seen naked if everyone else was; it was just that if it was only one set of genitals in the pool and those genitals chanced to be your own, you'd pretty well wish for death to come before the mockery. That's what it's like at the sort of highly academic, highly competitive school he went to. There's no physical bullying at all; the way to get one over on another boy is through sharp and devastating verbal stuff. To a schoolboy of this ilk, everything is good for a laugh, especially, they all believe, their own sexuality, and since they have yet to distinguish between ego and id, their penises and their immortal souls, the best - the most relieving - thing they can do is to project their worst-nightmare scenarios on to each other. Which brings us to the matter of Dickie's Bag. There are two Richards in Bent's year, one is black and known wittily as Rastus. The other, for reasons more profoundly rooted in the fear of the unknown, they insist on calling Dickie. There is nothing intrinsically disturbing about Dickie. He isn't effete or macho, nor is there anything about his bag to distinguish it from any other boy's bag. They all have similarly featureless holdalls to carry their books about; blue, black, brown, nothing fancy. Anyway, for unfathomable reasons, Dickie's bag is unanimously elected as a sort of sex object. Every morning, as Dickie hoves into view, the cry goes go up, \"Dickie's Bag! Dickie's Bag!\" And the whole bunch of them fall upon the luckless receptacle and hump the daylights out of it. Coe nearly smiles at the memory. It was true, yes. He recently met a man he hadn't seen for 22 years and found it difficult talking with him after all that time until he mentioned Dickie's bag. What can he say? It was just something they did. They humped the bag and it kind of set them up for the day. Did he join in? Of course he joined in. The whole point of the exercise was that it was collective. Collective, sublime and incomprehensible, as all schoolboy humour is. He went a bit shifty-eyed then and swivelled his focus around the floor until his eye fell upon my bag, a rather fine carpet number much admired by taxi-drivers, lying open and vulnerable with all its used tissues and fag packets showing. \"No,\" he says drily. \"Not my type.\" It is an uncharacteristic moment of levity. Coe is courteous, painstakingly truthful, co-operative and generous, but he is not a man to demean himself by courting a cheap laugh. I've often noticed that about people who are funny for a living; it's as though the other side of the coin of anarchy - which is what funny's all about - the one they front up with, is an abiding gravity, a wall of diffidence five feet thick that you'd be ill-advised to try to penetrate. All his narrators have this kind of withdrawn, hesitant quality. I had to ask. Was that you lurking at the open door to watch daft, fat Joan sprawled naked on her bed? The man who covertly marvelled at the staggering beauty of her body, but then, when she said something matey like, \"Aren't you coming in then?\", turned and tippy-toed silently away? No, he says. He made it up. Yet he cannot tell a lie. If he hadn't made it up, if it had really happened then, yes, he'd have skipped off. \"Men say to me, come on, any man in that situation would have been in like Flynn, but my impression - and maybe this is just the kind of friends I have gathered around myself - is that people aren't nearly as sexually confident or assertive as they portray themselves, or as they are portrayed in 95% of fiction. The truth is, there is nothing more frightening than a huge, succulent girl lying naked on a bed saying Come On In. Nothing. No. Really...\" He is in earnest. \"Men,\" he says, solemn as a polytechnic sociology tutor, \"have been disenfranchised by the sexual politics of the past 20 years. Much as Old Labour voters don't have anywhere to put themselves any more. The options offered by our culture, or the media, or whatever you want to call it, are New Lad and New Man. And neither really exists. New Lad is hedonistic, emotionally ruthless, uncommitted, full of bravado. New Man is emotionally, comically conscientious and domesticated. One would leap on Joan, the other tiptoe away. It's a pathetic choice.\" A typical victim of male disenfranchisement would be Robert, the poor sod in The House Of Sleep who gets in such a sweat getting in touch with his other gender self that he winds up having a sex change. Which is clearly neither true of the author, nor any kind of stab at social realism. But it is a metaphor. We get nurtured, for all we know against our nature, to be acceptable, attractive members of our sex, then when we fail to find nirvana we re-nurture ourselves, and - in extremis, turn to the other absurdity. And that doesn't work, either. It's nothing to laugh at. Coe had written three unpublished novels - four if you include the Jason oeuvre when he was eight - by the time he was 25. It was then he took a violent dislike to all his male protagonists and decided, in a purely literary sense, to change sex. The Accidental Woman (for it was she) wrenched \u00a3200 from the publishers Duckworth and became, he says, the literary non-event of the 80s. But it broke, as it were, his duck. He remembers what it was like back then, living in a bedsit in Coventry, sending off the Jiffy bag and getting it back with the rejection slip over and over again. He kept them. Sometimes, he gets them out and reads them again. At the time, they failed to daunt; in fact, they came as terribly thrilling missives from the throbbing head of literary London. He knows now they're just stock phrases that publishers dash off a hundred times a day, but back then \"shows promise\" or \"we'd be interested in your next effort\" told him that he existed, that he was a contender. He remembers getting a rejection slip from Punch for a short story. It was just the standard thing, except that someone had written, in handwriting, \"Thanks\" at the bottom. It was like a beaker of water, he says, to a thirsty man. Encouraged, he moved to a shared dump in Bermondsey and set about A Touch Of Love, for which Duckworth doubled its ante. Coe, meanwhile, had already embarked on his own personal sentimental journey, a trip that strangely exemplifies the promise that life will imitate art if you take both of these things seriously. In the mid-80s, you'll recall, people read Amis and Barnes and Ishiguro et al, and Coe was no exception to this rule. His own God, however - the writer of whom he actually pronounces the word \"Phew!\" - is Alasdair Gray. The first Gray to strike him in the solar plexus (\"And this is quite odd, actually,\" he understates) was called 1982, Janine. It was a novel about the Thatcher years and one night in the life of a deeply depressed man confronting the cock-up he made of his life. Janine is the fantasy figure he creates to take his mind off the loss of the love of his life. In other words, she is the great sex symbol, the redeemer of the great inconsolable cataclysm in the hearts of man. The woman. And then Coe met Janine. I mean, that was her name. So, in 1987, Janine. Coe was keeping body and soul together by working part-time in the Dickensian office of a firm of solicitors, proof-reading legal documents. It was an ideal job for a novelist in that it was so mind-numbingly boring it didn't sap your imaginative juices, so you'd be feeling quite creatively spry by the time you got back to your Oliver portable. Meanwhile, the other side of his desk, Janine was similarly employed, unaware of the significance of her Christian name. They developed a modus operandi in order to stay awake. He'd read a lease aloud to her, putting in all the punctuation marks and capitalisations, then she'd do the same back. This went on for six months. Call it a courtship. \"It was strange,\" he says in his enigmatic way. \"There was all this talking going on, but not about anything. Just a lot of noise being made.\" No shades of Joan, then? There were, he concedes, \"textural factors\". The office began a thing where people went for a drink together after work and, yes, he asked her out and, yes, they married. Suffice it to say that the dedication of What A Carve Up! reads \"1994, Janine\", and subsequent novels have extended their dedications to Janine and Matilda and to Janine and Matilda and Madeline. And that Alasdair Gray, when Coe eventually met his hero, vowed to pulp 1982, Janine if anything went wrong with their marriage. Fatherhood was not a place he entered without trepidation. He had thought he would never have children, he has almost forgotten why. When you think that it's a choice you can make, that's the problem: you think about it. He thought he had parent's block the way other people have writer's block. The simple fact was that he was scared. He'd grown up, or rather not grown up, believing himself to be clever and funny, as if that was enough to be going on with. And it's not. Clever and funny doesn't come close. It equips you, maybe, to be a comic novelist, not an adult male. So he stopped thinking about it. Now that his daughters have been born, he realises he wasn't wrong. But then, he didn't know, either, what he was made of. You don't until you've lived with a three-year-old, plumbed the depths of your reserves of energy and generosity, found strengths in yourself you never dreamt you had. You grow up. And this is the easy bit. A small child is a lunatic, there's no doubt about it. They're nuts. \"I mean,\" he says, \"what can you do when the tantrum's because the imaginary friend hasn't called round when they promised they would? You're in the realm of the deeply irrational, but it's a kind of a relief to be in that realm for a while, knowing that terrible, earth-shattering disappointment is only in the head. It's a dismal thought that it's going to become rational later on.\" There is no end to catastrophic expectation for any of us, it seems. At the end of The Rotters' Club, Coe has written a sentence that goes on for 15,000 words, which will doubtless be featured in the next edition of the Guinness Book Of Records. As a triumph of form over content it has to be seen to be believed. Coe is fairly sanguine about it. He reckons the content dictated the form. Had Bent not won the girl of his dreams? Had Mrs Thatcher not been elected to lead our benighted country? Do these twin dramas not merit the odd stylistic firework? And, besides, there's a Czech writer who once wrote a whole novel with nary a full stop. So how's that for clever and funny? Coe is already working on a sequel to The Rotters' Club, which will leap forward to the 90s, so putting paid to the 20th century - or rather his treatment of the last three decades of it. This afternoon he will listen to BS Johnson's tapes on the big, 50s tape-recorder. Johnson recorded everything, as luck has it. Dinner parties, conversations with his friends, everything. And then? He'd prefer not to contemplate what comes next. \"How do you write a novel about global warming?\" he says. And answers himself. \"You can't. It's too big. The tools just don't do the job. You can't get your head round it.\" He will. \u0095 The Rotters' Club is published by Viking at \u00a314.99 \u0095 Jonathan Coe will be live online on Guardian Unlimited, Books, at 3pm on March 8.

He has written a study of T S Eliot's anti-Semitism, and completed Idolizing Pictures while acting for the defence in the David Irving libel trial. Irving's display of anti-Semitism red in tooth and claw has sharpened what began as a scholarly lecture in memory of publisher Walter Neurath, a German-Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9.

It has provided philistines, zealots and tyrants with scriptural justification for all manner of censorships, persecutions and bonfires, massacres of images and their makers. It has also pushed artists to capture the transcendental. </p> <p>Julius plots the different Christian and Jewish responses to the prohibition by initially contrasting two pictures: Ingres's \"The Vow of Louis XIII\" (1824) and Komar and Melamid's \"The Origins of Socialist Realism\" (1982-3). The first, he says, is a work of Christian art - \"theology in a frame\" glorifying the monarch, the Virgin and painting itself. The second, produced by a wry Russian-Jewish duo, deploys pastiche on the verge of camp to subvert the cult of Stalin and the neo-classical solemnity of socialist realist art itself. It is, says Julius, deeply Jewish. </p> <p>A work of Christian art is made possible, despite the ban on graven images, by Christianity's escape clause, the Incarnation. If Jesus is a representation of the Holy Spirit, the painter is thereby, in Julius's contractual terminology, \"mandated\" to represent the world. Jewish artists, whose religion encompasses no Incarnation and whose god is incorporeal and invisible, are more boxed in by the Second Commandment. One of Chagall's great-uncles refused to shake hands with him when he learned that he made drawings. </p> <p>In a central section of forensic ferocity, armed with wide philosophical and theological reference, Julius distils three alternatives for a Jewish art or aesthetics under the Biblical prohibition: an art, or anti-art, of the sublime and the infinite (the abstract expressionists Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottleib); an iconic art, devoted to Jewish motifs (Chagall, Kitaj, but also Holocaust survivors' \"art of witness\"); and an art of idol-breaking through irony, which Julius differentiates from avant-garde anti-bourgeois iconoclasm, which still idolises art. </p> <p>Komar and Melamid are once more his exemplars: in their \"What is to be Done with Monumental Propaganda\" (1992) they offered a Swiftian modest proposal aimed at turning Moscow into \"a phantasmagoric garden of post-totalitarian art\" - not by demolishing statues, as violent Byzantine iconoclasts and post-communist celebrants had, but by mockery and ironic recycling that lay bare the machinery of idolising anything.

Of course it can. After all, you're a machine, and you think. That's not the right question, as Dupuy's elegant and lucid work argues. The revolution in what we now call cognitive science in the middle of the last century lay not in an anthropomorphisation of machines, but, as his title suggests, in a project to mechanise our understanding of the human.

After all, you're a machine, and you think. That's not the right question, as Dupuy's elegant and lucid work argues.

      "body": "<p>Twenty-seven years have passed since Christopher Lee last played Count Dracula, but the Lord of the Undead's cloak still shrouds him. And seeing Lee in person just confirms that he was born to play the part. Now almost 80, he looks uncannily young; he still has his air of slightly sinister, haughty majesty; and his voice remains sonorous. As he puts it himself: \"We were both an embarrassing member of a great and noble family.\" </p> <p>Defying the protestations of his high-born mother, who considered acting infra dig and a profession only for people with no morals, Lee went on to make his name playing some of the most morally bankrupt characters of all time. Two hundred films on from having a one-word part in Olivier's Hamlet, Lee is still working as hard as ever. He is currently doing post-production work on Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings, which is purported to have used pretty much all of New Zealand as a set; and he recently finished filming the latest of the Star Wars prequels. </p> <p>\"Hammer was an important part of my life, and generally speaking, we all had a lot of fun,\" says Lee of his horror days. Even if he wasn't playing Dracula, he was almost always the villain or the monster, from his myriad reincarnations as Fu Manchu to his return from the dead as The Mummy. \"Fun seems to be a three-letter word these days, although with directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas, it's fun, fun, fun while working yourself to death. But if you compare those Hammer movies to what has been made in the last 20 years_ Brian de Palma, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Wes Craven, Tim Burton and Peter Jackson have all said the same thing to me: 'We were brought up on your movies.' And it certainly shows in theirs.\" </p> <p>While many of Lee's old horror films were hard to distinguish from one another - nobody really needs to see Dracula AD 1972 and The Satanic Rites Of Dracula - a few were genuinely daring. Lee himself put pressure on Hammer to make an adaptation of Dennis Wheatley's tale of high-flying diplomats indulging in Satan worship, The Devil Rides Out. \"I thought that people should know about the dangers of Satanism, and diabolism does exist - there's no question about it,\" says Lee, dramatically. \"We're trying to get that remade by the new Hammer company. It would be a great first film for them to make. Think of the special effects.\" </p> <p>Then there was The Wicker Man. One of the most bizarre films to come out of the UK, it tells the story of pagan worship on a remote Scottish island, with Edward Woodward's puritanical policeman coming over from the mainland to confront Lee's dissolute Lord of Misrule, and getting sacrificed to appease the gods in the process. Its mixture of rustic shopkeeper-philosophy soap opera, sap-rising lewdness and unexpected death makes for a truly shocking movie, and it remains Lee's favourite. \"Wonderful film... had a hell of a time getting it made. It's the story of two beliefs - one is organised religion and the other is the old belief that we must revere nature and appease it if necessary. Its power lies in the fact that you never expect what eventually happens, because everyone is so nice. All the negatives and out-takes vanished, and I do not believe it is possible that that was an accident. It is even difficult to see the longer version of the film that exists, in which Britt Ekland initiates a young man while I recite a poem by Walt Whitman over two snails making love.\" </p> <p>But Lee has no time for today's horror. \"There have been some absolutely ghastly films recently, physically repellent. What we did was fantasy, fairy tales - no real person can copy what we did. But they can do what Hannibal Lecter does, if they're so inclined, people like Jeffrey Dahmer and Dennis Nilsen, and for that reason, I think such films are dangerous.\" </p> <p>Theoretically, however, there's nothing to stop a bunch of Scottish islanders laying pagan waste to a virginal copper; but that's nitpicking. Lee has forsaken horror for some much meatier roles in recent years, including a portrayal of the founder of Pakistan in the 1997 film Jinnah. It was filmed in that country despite a campaign by a national newspaper to get Lee deported for daring to portray such an iconic figure. \"We subsequently discovered that the man writing the articles had auditioned for the role himself, and this was his way of getting back. Although I'm not the best judge, I think it's the finest work I've ever done because it was the greatest challenge. How do you play an icon who is also a real man? Who only died 50-odd years ago? I did play Ramses II once, who lived to be 91 and had 120 children, but he died 4,000 years ago.\" </p> <p>Lee is not at liberty to say much about The Lord of the Rings, a three-film adaptation of the Tolkein trilogy; but since he has read the books every year since they were published (1954-55), playing the character of Saruman is the realisation of a long-held ambition. \"The book is such a work of brilliance and majesty - Tolkein wrote an epic on the scale of The Iliad or The Odyssey. He even created a language, Elfish, which you can read, write and speak. Despite having seen absolutely nothing of the film, I still think it's going to create cinema history. Peter Jackson's instincts are extraordinary, as is his stamina. My God, it would have to be, to film solidly for 15 months.\" </p> <p>Lee's longest stretch between projects, in a career spanning 55 years, has been four weeks. \"The thing I have always tried to do is surprise people, to present them with something they didn't expect. As an actor, I have always tried to be unconventional. Even Scaramanga in The Man With The Golden Gun could be charming - he would be dull if I had just played him as a thug. I'll be 80 next year, if it pleases God. How many actors of my age are playing leading roles in major films?\" </p> <p>How many are still alive? All of Lee's contemporaries - Peter Cushing, John Carradine, Vincent Price - are now gone; and while Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff ended their days parodying their greatest characters, Lee managed to transcend the roles of one Fu Manchu and Dracula after another a long time ago. And he looks pretty good on it, too. The secret, he maintains, is hard work, plenty of golf, and being safely asleep before the Prince of Darkness can call the hours his own. </p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Lee is in conversation with his biographer Jonathan Rigby at the Barbican Screen (020-7638 8891) on Wednesday, following a screening of Jinnah.</p>",

Since Reeves started his career by playing morons in Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure and I Love You To Death, dimwits in Parenthood and Bram Stoker's Dracula, and average guys who didn't seem to have all that much on the ball in River's Edge, Johnny Mnemonic and A Walk In The Clouds, this on-screen intellectual evolution is edifying indeed. It is as if the ageing Gary Cooper, the apotheosis of laconic stolidity, suddenly found himself cast as a dashing nobleman, a preening fop or even a gay caballero. </p> <p>In The Watcher, Reeves continues his laudable migration away from lunkheaded roles, playing a talented serial killer who moves from California to Chicago to be near James Spader, the FBI agent he delights in tormenting. A few years earlier, while Spader was working his case, the two had developed a textbook cat-and-mouse camaraderie. An obvious victim of unresolved self-esteem issues, it was never enough for Reeves to strangle a large number of women with piano wire; he also needed to be respected for his craft. Through his passion and industry, Spader, a gifted pro in his own right, grudgingly provided that homage.</p> <p>But one day Reeves pushes the relationship too far by invading Spader's space and incinerating the woman he loves. Devastated by the murder, Spader relocates to the Windy City, seemingly to be closer to the woman's grave.</p> <p>Initially, the change of scenery does not help. Spader, perfectly cast as a zombie, spends day after day in his tiny apartment injecting or ingesting every pharmaceutical known to man. But things get a whole lot worse when Reeves turns up, announcing his arrival by murdering a young woman who lives in Spader's apartment building. And things really deteriorate when Reeves begins sending Spader photos of his next victim, giving him a scant 12 hours to save her. As hoped, this has the salubrious effect of yanking Spader out of his funk.</p> <p>It is inevitable in a relationship such as this that one of the parties is finally going to break down and seek psychiatric help. Spader is the first to crack, hooking up with a psychologist played by Marisa Tomei. Tomei, who once won an Academy Award for her supporting role in My Cousin Vinny, has lately become a sort of poor man's Sandra Bullock. Not much of an actress in the best of times, Tomei does bring a much-appreciated perkiness to an exceedingly dark motion picture. Unfortunately, this only lasts until Reeves also decides to seek her services. Although Tomei does advance a number of provocative theories, hypothesising that Reeves and Spader secretly need one another to bring meaning into their otherwise empty lives, she is basically no help at all.</p> <p>As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Spader has not learned a whole lot from his previous experiences with Reeves. Since he knows that the killer is a voyeur and a stalker who likes to murder pretty young women, it would have made more sense for him to find an ugly male psychiatrist to help sort out his problems, but no, he has to choose Tomei, thereby signing her death warrant. This is one of the strange ironies of this unwholesome but generally endurable movie; though Spader seems like an intelligent man, he keeps doing incredibly stupid things, while Reeves, who seems about as intelligent as a Santa Monica car valet, continually astounds us with his prodigious homicidal wizardry. At this rate, he might still live to play Galileo.</p> <p>Eventually, Reeves begins to weary of the game and raises the stakes by abducting Tomei and putting her in a situation from which she cannot possibly extricate herself without having Spader put himself at the killer's mercy. At this point, the screenplay's connect-the-dots Freudian underpinnings come into play, as Spader must outwit the serial killer by addressing his gaping self-esteem problems. Though cathartic, the ending of the film is not terribly ingenious; indeed, the best thing about the last 15 minutes of the film is that Tomei has duct tape across her mouth and is thereby prevented from delineating any more of her inane theories.</p> <p>The most interesting question about The Watcher is why the three players chose to do it. In Spader's case, he will probably take whatever work he can get. In Tomei's case, she will definitely take whatever work she can get. In Reeves' case, who knows? For years he has been one of Hollywood's least predictable stars, now launching himself into the stratosphere with massive hits like Speed and The Matrix, now appearing in screwy duds like Feeling Minnesota, Cold Fusion and this. His choices have always been strange, and they are not getting any less strange as he gets older.</p> <p>For my money the best-looking actor in Hollywood, Reeves is slowly but surely approaching the point where he can no longer play vulnerable, charismatic young men who are definitely not playing with a full deck. It is hard to imagine Reeves at age 50 still playing the goofy Valley Boy. But then again, it was hard to imagine Reeves at age 25 playing a French nobleman in Dangerous Liaisons or a callow youth in Much Ado About Nothing. Someone once said that God protects drunks, babies and the United States of America. Surveying Reeves' consistent ability to bounce back from substandard films like The Watcher and return to the big time, one has to believe that the name \"Keanu\" also appears on God's list of protected species. </p>",

      "body": "<p>The foot and mouth disease outbreak could not have happened in a worse place, according to pig industry experts. The abattoir at Cheale Meats outside Brentwood, Essex, is a specialist operator dealing in cull sows - pigs at the end of their breeding life.</p> <p>Ian Campbell, regional manager for the National Pig Association, said there is no UK market for cull pigs but they are sought after in Europe for salami and the German sausage trade because lumpy pork meat suits continental tastes.</p> <p>\"Without the German taste for sausages and continental-style salami there would be nowhere to send these pigs. A farmer with a large breeding stock might have 30 or so a year to send but not all at once - they would go singly or a few at a time.\"</p> <p>Lorries that tour farms picking up cull sows can potentially spread foot and mouth to many premises on one round. Normally lorries would be disinfected before each pick-up and after each unloading at the abattoir.</p> <p>It was this nightmare scenario of multiple pick-ups potentially spreading the disease which Ministry of Agriculture vets found when the outbreak at Cheale Meats was confirmed. Up to 400 farms deliver to Cheale Meats.</p> <p>One of the premises MAFF visited early in the investigation was Burnside Farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth disease outbreak could not have happened in a worse place, according to pig industry experts. The abattoir at Cheale Meats outside Brentwood, Essex, is a specialist operator dealing in cull sows - pigs at the end of their breeding life. Ian Campbell, regional manager for the National Pig Association, said there is no UK market for cull pigs but they are sought after in Europe for salami and the German sausage trade because lumpy pork meat suits continental tastes. \"Without the German taste for sausages and continental-style salami there would be nowhere to send these pigs. A farmer with a large breeding stock might have 30 or so a year to send but not all at once - they would go singly or a few at a time.\" Lorries that tour farms picking up cull sows can potentially spread foot and mouth to many premises on one round. Normally lorries would be disinfected before each pick-up and after each unloading at the abattoir. It was this nightmare scenario of multiple pick-ups potentially spreading the disease which Ministry of Agriculture vets found when the outbreak at Cheale Meats was confirmed. Up to 400 farms deliver to Cheale Meats. One of the premises MAFF visited early in the investigation was Burnside Farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland. This was a collecting centre for cull pigs from the North of England and Scotland. A statement from MAFF yesterday, which confirmed foot and mouth at Burnside Farm, also said the pigs there had been ill for some time, probably showing symptoms for two weeks with an incubation period before that. The result of the outbreak is a collapse of the continental cull pig trade and with it a useful income for farmers, and a disposal route for old pigs. Apart from Cheale Meats, where the original outbreak was discovered, there are two other abattoirs that take cull sows as part of the continental sausage trade - Dawkins International at Congerstone, in Warwickshire and EE Pilgrim, of Banham, near Norwich, which is also owned by Cheale Meats. Because cull sows are not prime meat they fetch less than \"clean pigs\" bred for the table. According to Peter Kingwell, marketing director of Chippenham livestock market, cull sows were fetching 40p to 50p a live kilo a week ago, compared with 85p a kilo for ordinary pigs. At Northampton livestock market on Thursday only five cull sows were sold, compared with 186 the week before. Peter Reynolds of the meat and livestock commission said prices had dropped to 32p a kilo for cull sows and only 28 were sold in the whole country on Thursday. Clean pig prices were holding steady and 2,162 were sold. Yesterday Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said that as a result of foot and mouth and the recent swine fever outbreak he was asking officials to look at whether modern industrial farming methods made Britain more susceptible to the spread of disease. The trend for larger slaughterhouses and specialist markets such as the cull sows sent to the continent were two areas to be examined. Some farmers were already calling yesterday for a ban on meat imports because that is widely believed to be the most likely cause of the outbreak. Infected meat, even deep frozen, will carry the virus and it can even survive in cooked meats if not thoroughly heated through. Additional reporting by Max Houghton Talk about it What do you think?

      "body": "<p>Having employed the term \"bog standard\" last week I am now assailed with requests to explain what it means. I shall answer this in one brusque and immaculate sentence: I haven't the slightest idea. Since Alastair Campbell offended David Blunkett and others by applying it to comprehensive schools, the popular verdict seems to be that it derives from bog, meaning lavatory. But this is disputed. An erudite letter to this newspaper suggested it was a short form for British or German (BoG) standards of engineering. Others think it has more to do with a bog or quagmire, as particularly common in Ireland, and therefore amounts to a characteristic English v Irish sneer. People who live in and near bogs are often routinely disparaged. \"The bog-bred youth\" some bigot averred in 1850 \"tells you lies\", while others claimed that bog-hay was only one-third the quality of hay made from sown grass. </p> <p>Sir Walter Scott, who in Smallweed's opinion was someone who knew a thing or two, wrote in The Abbot: \"The kelpie must flit from the black-bog pit\"; suggesting that bog standard is a level of achievement which even a kelpie would flee from. Bog can also mean bugbear; in the counties of Derby and Lincoln it used also to be an adjective, meaning blustering, proud or saucy. </p> <p><strong> An old journalist writes: </strong> Smallweed is way off the map. Bog standard refers to a newspaper called the Standard which was published in Bog - which my gazetteer says is a locality in the county of Cumberland in the former rural district of Wigton - until its editor ran off with a milkman, this giving its title the broadly pejorative connotations it carries today. </p> <p>\"Let us not mince words\", some pompous commentator writes in a pompous newspaper. Yet mincing words is exactly what needs to be done when expressions like \"let us not mince words\" are used in a public place. They are nothing more than a kind of nervy throat-clearing, a condition they share with \"let us not pull our punches\" and \"let us not beat about the bush\". Such sentiments might have rather more relevance if one ever read pleas for the opposite. How I long to read a piece which begins: \"Let us mince words\", or even, \"What is a bush, unless it is something that needs to be beaten about?\" The same applies to the common disease of prefacing sentences with the formula: \"This is not the time\"... \"This is not the time\", some expert will write, \"to blue all our hard-won revenues on worthless spending projects\", as if that might be justified at some other juncture. Moreover, I have to say... </p> <p><strong> Perplexed (Irthlingborough) writes: </strong> You have yet to explain what kind of kelpie Sir Walter expected to flee from the bog-pit. Was it the water spirit in the form of a horse which in Scottish folklore delights in drowning its riders? Or was it a breed of Australian sheepdog, derived from the Scottish collie? Both may, prima facie and ipso facto, have loomed large in the life of the author of Ivanhoe.</p> <p> <strong>Smallweed responds with a mildly smarmy courtesy: </strong> Let us not beat about the bush. I haven't the slightest idea.As for your Irthlingborough, I hope to include it in my list of places to visit this summer, once I have finished with Driffield. </p> <p> <strong>Places to</strong> visit this summer - Driffield. In fact there are two Driffields in Yorkshire, just as there are two Hartlepools to its north. The one which most concerns us is Great Driffield, which calls itself the capital of the wolds. You will find it on the road from York to Bridlington. It is also handy for such tourist hotspots as Scarborough, Whitby and Hull. Not far away is the great city of Leeds; just a little further are Durham and Sheffield. Beyond them are New York, Santiago and Buenos Aires. There's what looks like a handsome mill at River Head (I rely on the internet website here) while the sparkling Driffield Beck, picturesquely named the Water Forlorns, threads first through the park and then through the town centre to join the Driffield canal. Watch out for kelpies. Little Driffield has a pond and a green. This area is also, I'm told, a great place for borage.

      "bodyText": "Having employed the term \"bog standard\" last week I am now assailed with requests to explain what it means. I shall answer this in one brusque and immaculate sentence: I haven't the slightest idea. Since Alastair Campbell offended David Blunkett and others by applying it to comprehensive schools, the popular verdict seems to be that it derives from bog, meaning lavatory. But this is disputed. An erudite letter to this newspaper suggested it was a short form for British or German (BoG) standards of engineering. Others think it has more to do with a bog or quagmire, as particularly common in Ireland, and therefore amounts to a characteristic English v Irish sneer. People who live in and near bogs are often routinely disparaged. \"The bog-bred youth\" some bigot averred in 1850 \"tells you lies\", while others claimed that bog-hay was only one-third the quality of hay made from sown grass. Sir Walter Scott, who in Smallweed's opinion was someone who knew a thing or two, wrote in The Abbot: \"The kelpie must flit from the black-bog pit\"; suggesting that bog standard is a level of achievement which even a kelpie would flee from. Bog can also mean bugbear; in the counties of Derby and Lincoln it used also to be an adjective, meaning blustering, proud or saucy. An old journalist writes: Smallweed is way off the map. Bog standard refers to a newspaper called the Standard which was published in Bog - which my gazetteer says is a locality in the county of Cumberland in the former rural district of Wigton - until its editor ran off with a milkman, this giving its title the broadly pejorative connotations it carries today. \"Let us not mince words\", some pompous commentator writes in a pompous newspaper. Yet mincing words is exactly what needs to be done when expressions like \"let us not mince words\" are used in a public place. They are nothing more than a kind of nervy throat-clearing, a condition they share with \"let us not pull our punches\" and \"let us not beat about the bush\". Such sentiments might have rather more relevance if one ever read pleas for the opposite. How I long to read a piece which begins: \"Let us mince words\", or even, \"What is a bush, unless it is something that needs to be beaten about?\" The same applies to the common disease of prefacing sentences with the formula: \"This is not the time\"... \"This is not the time\", some expert will write, \"to blue all our hard-won revenues on worthless spending projects\", as if that might be justified at some other juncture. Moreover, I have to say... Perplexed (Irthlingborough) writes: You have yet to explain what kind of kelpie Sir Walter expected to flee from the bog-pit. Was it the water spirit in the form of a horse which in Scottish folklore delights in drowning its riders? Or was it a breed of Australian sheepdog, derived from the Scottish collie? Both may, prima facie and ipso facto, have loomed large in the life of the author of Ivanhoe. Smallweed responds with a mildly smarmy courtesy: Let us not beat about the bush. I haven't the slightest idea.As for your Irthlingborough, I hope to include it in my list of places to visit this summer, once I have finished with Driffield. Places to visit this summer - Driffield. In fact there are two Driffields in Yorkshire, just as there are two Hartlepools to its north. The one which most concerns us is Great Driffield, which calls itself the capital of the wolds. You will find it on the road from York to Bridlington. It is also handy for such tourist hotspots as Scarborough, Whitby and Hull. Not far away is the great city of Leeds; just a little further are Durham and Sheffield. Beyond them are New York, Santiago and Buenos Aires. There's what looks like a handsome mill at River Head (I rely on the internet website here) while the sparkling Driffield Beck, picturesquely named the Water Forlorns, threads first through the park and then through the town centre to join the Driffield canal. Watch out for kelpies. Little Driffield has a pond and a green. This area is also, I'm told, a great place for borage. I only hope that Irthlingborough, of which I so far know little, proves to be even half as enticing. Like most breeds easily trodden under foot, we Weeds tend to stick together.

Clinton has rightly been praised for his political skills, but we now see that there was a kink in his antennae. He could sense danger only when he expected it to be there. Able to swim successfully through a pool of sharks, he never understood that he might be stung to death on the beach.</p> <p>Apart from Clinton's biographies, the main victim in this is Hugh Rodham's sister. Not knowing what her husband was doing with other women was never going to be an electoral handicap for Hillary. It's in the nature of such events for a wife to be uninformed. Complete ignorance of your brother's dealings with your husband - the defence Mrs Clinton has offered - seems more careless, especially from a woman who belongs to a generation which prides itself on awareness. The senator from New York is getting a reputation as a woman who doesn't notice what's going on around her. Vote Hillary - Her Eyes Are Shut is not much of a poster slogan for a senate re-election race in six years' time; it's a no-hoper for the presidential campaign she craved.</p> <p>In early January, as President Clinton began his final month in office, with unprecedented approval ratings for a lame-duck, I thought about asking William Hill for odds on the Clintons outdoing the Bushes and producing three presidents from the same family: Hillary in 2004 or 2008; Chelsea, as the child of two political icons, in about 2028. Now they seem destined to be a one commander-in- chief family like most of the others. And the clan's single president, who seemed triumphantly to have escaped disgrace and lawyers, has placed himself back in their court.</p> <p>The effect of killing yourself is to leave questions which torment for ever those who knew and loved you. This suicide will, I suppose, at least leave us a note in the form of his memoirs, but these can be expected to be characteristically evasive. And so we sit and wonder what drove him to put the gun to his head on what should have been the happiest day of his life. The only explanation is that the balance of his mind was disturbed by ego and self-pity.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Clinton has rightly been praised for his political skills, but we now see that there was a kink in his antennae. He could sense danger only when he expected it to be there. Able to swim successfully through a pool of sharks, he never understood that he might be stung to death on the beach. Apart from Clinton's biographies, the main victim in this is Hugh Rodham's sister. Not knowing what her husband was doing with other women was never going to be an electoral handicap for Hillary. It's in the nature of such events for a wife to be uninformed. Complete ignorance of your brother's dealings with your husband - the defence Mrs Clinton has offered - seems more careless, especially from a woman who belongs to a generation which prides itself on awareness. The senator from New York is getting a reputation as a woman who doesn't notice what's going on around her. Vote Hillary - Her Eyes Are Shut is not much of a poster slogan for a senate re-election race in six years' time; it's a no-hoper for the presidential campaign she craved. In early January, as President Clinton began his final month in office, with unprecedented approval ratings for a lame-duck, I thought about asking William Hill for odds on the Clintons outdoing the Bushes and producing three presidents from the same family: Hillary in 2004 or 2008; Chelsea, as the child of two political icons, in about 2028. Now they seem destined to be a one commander-in- chief family like most of the others. And the clan's single president, who seemed triumphantly to have escaped disgrace and lawyers, has placed himself back in their court. The effect of killing yourself is to leave questions which torment for ever those who knew and loved you. This suicide will, I suppose, at least leave us a note in the form of his memoirs, but these can be expected to be characteristically evasive. And so we sit and wonder what drove him to put the gun to his head on what should have been the happiest day of his life. The only explanation is that the balance of his mind was disturbed by ego and self-pity. comment@theguardian.com",

The court heard that children were \"clearly at risk\" in her care.</p> <p>Miss Roberts, a devout Christian, has had more than 80 children and young adults pass through her care and has won numerous awards including carer of the year, as well as being the focus of television documentaries and books for her work with children with learning difficulties and behavioural problems.</p> <p>But her methods were questioned in a judgment handed down at the end of the longest case in the history of Britain's family courts. Mr Justice Hughes criticised her ethos, which involved children changing their name to Roberts and losing contact with their birth families.</p> <p>The family division of the high court found that Miss Roberts and one of her adopted children, Karen Roberts, who eventually came to help run the Old Convent, in Bicknacre, Essex, encouraged some of the children to make confessions of sexual abuse. It found that Karen Roberts, who suffers from a schizo-affective disorder, also stole \u00a326,000 in criminal injuries compensation from two of these children, with Roberts's knowledge.</p> <p>The court heard allegations from two families that children had been improperly influenced into making claims of sexual abuse and giving false evidence at the Old Bailey. Two defendants were acquitted but one was sentenced to 12 years. He has maintained his innocence and the children - now adults - have admitted they lied.</p> <p>The judge believed that this was part of a pattern in the Old Convent. He said: \"I am satisfied that both Jeanette Roberts and Karen Roberts, convinced in their own minds that there had been sexual abuse, subjected the children to intense and probably emotionally charged questioning until they told stories which it was believed were there to be told.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"Jeanette was and remains very likely to question children in such a way as to produce wholly unreliable accusations of sexual abuse.\"</p> <p>The court action was brought by Essex county council following concerns about children in Miss Roberts's care. Social services had applied to remove six children but yesterday Mr Justice Hughes said only two would not be returned.</p> <p>The case followed a raid on the home in November 1998 when more than 100 police officers and social workers removed everyone residing in the Old Convent. Most were vulnerable adults who had once been children in Miss Roberts's care and were allowed to return, but Essex county council said the six should be removed because they might suffer harm.</p> <p>Mr Justice Hughes said: \"That contention is founded upon a large number of very serious complaints about her care for children over very nearly the whole of the 30 years mentioned.\" These claims of abuse are all denied by Miss Roberts.</p> <p>The judgment says the complaints \"include a great many histories of children unduly influenced in what they said to outsiders... Of these the most serious were the statements of no less than five children from two different families that as a result of improper influence by those at the Old Convent they had made allegations that they had been sexually abused in their former homes when they had not.\"</p> <p>Claims that the regime was habitually violent were not founded but the judge said there were occasions when children were smacked, sat on and treated roughly and that \"although Miss Roberts generally held herself notably in check, from time to time she lost her temper\".</p> <p>Children had been \"disciplined by being confined to their rooms, often locked in\", and one autistic child was locked in his room with no one else in the house except a very disabled child. A boy of 22 months was locked in his room at 8am on the day of the police raid. The key could not be found. The judge accepted this was sometimes done because there were so many difficult children to deal with, but what was done was bad practice and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Last night, social services and adoption agencies came in for criticism for allowing one woman to adopt so many children and for failing to detect the flaws in her regime sooner.</p> <p>Mike Leadbetter, Essex director of social services, conceded that there was a lack of coordination and cross-checking between the authorities. \"The problem was that no one ever really added the numbers up. Each case was treated individually by social workers and the courts,\" he said.</p> <p>An additional problem, he said, was Miss Roberts's public status as a \"paragon\" of virtue, which meant the adopting authorities gave her a very sympathetic hearing.</p> <p>Mr Leadbetter defends his authority's decision to spend \u00a36m pursuing the case on the grounds that it had no choice. \"With over 120 complainants and such a huge number of allegations, it would have been a breach of duty under the Children Act not to investigate,\" he said.</p> <p>Ian Grant, the senior manager seconded to lead the social services investigation, maintains that the raid by police and social workers - the object of bitter criticism by Jeanette Roberts's supporters - was \"carefully planned to cause minimum disruption\".</p> <p>The British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering agreed that Miss Roberts's powerful image - along with local authorities' desperation to place children seen as virtually unfosterable or unadoptable - explained the laxity in her case.</p> <p>Felicity Collier, the director, said: \"This distressing case demonstrates that we can be no less rigorous in protecting children placed in foster care and adoption, than at home with parents or in residential care.\"</p> <p>Miss Roberts began caring for children in the late 1960s in the East End of London when she was 30.

      "bodyText": "A woman described as a saint on the BBC's Children in Need after she adopted more than 36 children and fostered many more was yesterday criticised by a judge as a liar and a risk to children. Jeanette Roberts, 61, was said to be a deceitful, unscrupulous woman who locked up children for long periods and encouraged them to tell stories of sexual abuse. The court heard that children were \"clearly at risk\" in her care. Miss Roberts, a devout Christian, has had more than 80 children and young adults pass through her care and has won numerous awards including carer of the year, as well as being the focus of television documentaries and books for her work with children with learning difficulties and behavioural problems.

An additional problem, he said, was Miss Roberts's public status as a \"paragon\" of virtue, which meant the adopting authorities gave her a very sympathetic hearing.

Ian Grant, the senior manager seconded to lead the social services investigation, maintains that the raid by police and social workers - the object of bitter criticism by Jeanette Roberts's supporters - was \"carefully planned to cause minimum disruption\". The British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering agreed that Miss Roberts's powerful image - along with local authorities' desperation to place children seen as virtually unfosterable or unadoptable - explained the laxity in her case. Felicity Collier, the director, said: \"This distressing case demonstrates that we can be no less rigorous in protecting children placed in foster care and adoption, than at home with parents or in residential care.\" Miss Roberts began caring for children in the late 1960s in the East End of London when she was 30.

Relationships were allowed within the family and some members married. Children born within the family believed their mothers were their sisters and that Miss Roberts was their mother. Allegations of abuse and other matters surfaced and Essex police launched Operation Camberley to investigate. All charges were dropped in the criminal case and Miss Roberts was left to fight to get the children back in her care. In court she fought to stop the details of the judgment being published but Mr Justice Hughes told her there was a public interest because of the numbers of children she cared for, because of the unusually extensive and expensive investigation and because the Old Convent had been given more than \u00a31m in charity money. The judgment looked at criticisms of the methods used during the police raid but concluded that they were \"steps conscientiously taken in the belief that they were necessary for the protection of the children and vulnerable people\". But her methods often worked and the judgment noted: \"In a number of cases children who were very disturbed on arrival have displayed much better behaviour after a while living there.\" The judge also noted that a number of risks no longer existed and applauded Miss Roberts's \"unusual level of commitment to children and other vulnerable people in her care [which] brought undoubted benefits to many\". But his judgment also found that \"Jeanette and her adult associates have an undoubted capacity for deception\" and that there was \"no doubt that there were throughout the years many occasions when children were roughly handled and smacked\". The judge said he \"met a great deal of outright untruth\" from Miss Roberts and other adults at the Old Convent. Miss Roberts wrote a letter to an adoption agency saying her brother committed suicide: he is still alive. She also told lies about how old her parents were when they died in order to be able to adopt more children. Additional reporting by Richard Smith",

      "body": "<p>Food producers and retailers were last night bracing themselves for the impact of the Ministry of Agriculture's seven-day ban on the movement of livestock in Britain. Wholesalers, butchers and supermarkets said that there was no reason for immediate shortages, but with memories of the public reaction to the fuel shortage, the food industry said the next few days would be critical.</p> <p><b> Butchers</b></p> <p>Most traditional butchers hang their red meat for seven to 10 days and so hold a week's supply in fridges on their premises. They buy their meat from wholesale markets which will now be closed or from abattoirs which will also have to stop working. \"It's the week after next that will count,\" said Graham Bidston, chief executive of the National Federation of Meat Traders.</p> <p>There are reasonable stocks of meat in chill stores. \"Since Christmas, trade has been quiet and when that happens, abattoirs take meat off the bone, vacuum pack it and chill it, which makes it last five to six weeks,\" said Essex butcher Roger Kelsey, whose shop is a few miles from the Brentwood abattoir where the outbreak was first found.</p> <p>If more meat has to be brought out of storage, prices are likely to rise, because the additional cost of haulage and processing.</p> <p><b> Supermarkets</b></p> <p>The main supermarket chains said they had plenty of food on the shelves and good stores in their depots, although they were reluctant to say how many days supply they usually held. They were preparing to increase the amount of poultry available to meet demand. Sainsbury's urged people not to panic buy and said it had plans in place should the ban be extended. \"We'll import where necessary. Sales are not affected at the moment.\"</p> <p>Tesco, which sources nearly all its meat in the UK, with the exception of bacon, also said that it was confident it had adequate stocks for the duration of the present ban.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Safeway said: \"At the moment we haven't noticed any change in buying. We are anticipating an increase in demand for poultry and fish and we are looking at finding new suppliers for that. We have enough meat supplies for a few days but we are looking elsewhere such as Ireland to find new suppliers.\"</p> <p><b> Wholesalers and processors</b></p> <p>The government-funded meat and livestock commission said there were enough stocks of British meat to cover the seven day ban. \"There is enough in the supply chain but life will get difficult after a week,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Grampian Country Foods, Britain's largest independent food firm, which slaughters 3.8m chickens and processes 20,000 pigs, 25,000 lambs and 1,400 cattle a week, was last night trying to assess the effects of the transport ban on its business.</p> <p>\"It will be serious for us and potentially for the consumer. We'll be twiddling our thumbs wondering what to do in a short time,\" said marketing director Alasdair Cox. Grampian, which employs 10,000 people is not contemplating redundancies.</p> <p><b> Hauliers</b></p> <p>Livestock hauliers feared the crisis could have a devastating effect on their business.

      "bodyText": "Food producers and retailers were last night bracing themselves for the impact of the Ministry of Agriculture's seven-day ban on the movement of livestock in Britain. Wholesalers, butchers and supermarkets said that there was no reason for immediate shortages, but with memories of the public reaction to the fuel shortage, the food industry said the next few days would be critical. Butchers Most traditional butchers hang their red meat for seven to 10 days and so hold a week's supply in fridges on their premises. They buy their meat from wholesale markets which will now be closed or from abattoirs which will also have to stop working. \"It's the week after next that will count,\" said Graham Bidston, chief executive of the National Federation of Meat Traders. There are reasonable stocks of meat in chill stores. \"Since Christmas, trade has been quiet and when that happens, abattoirs take meat off the bone, vacuum pack it and chill it, which makes it last five to six weeks,\" said Essex butcher Roger Kelsey, whose shop is a few miles from the Brentwood abattoir where the outbreak was first found. If more meat has to be brought out of storage, prices are likely to rise, because the additional cost of haulage and processing. Supermarkets The main supermarket chains said they had plenty of food on the shelves and good stores in their depots, although they were reluctant to say how many days supply they usually held. They were preparing to increase the amount of poultry available to meet demand. Sainsbury's urged people not to panic buy and said it had plans in place should the ban be extended. \"We'll import where necessary. Sales are not affected at the moment.\" Tesco, which sources nearly all its meat in the UK, with the exception of bacon, also said that it was confident it had adequate stocks for the duration of the present ban. A spokeswoman for Safeway said: \"At the moment we haven't noticed any change in buying. We are anticipating an increase in demand for poultry and fish and we are looking at finding new suppliers for that. We have enough meat supplies for a few days but we are looking elsewhere such as Ireland to find new suppliers.\" Wholesalers and processors The government-funded meat and livestock commission said there were enough stocks of British meat to cover the seven day ban. \"There is enough in the supply chain but life will get difficult after a week,\" said a spokesman. Grampian Country Foods, Britain's largest independent food firm, which slaughters 3.8m chickens and processes 20,000 pigs, 25,000 lambs and 1,400 cattle a week, was last night trying to assess the effects of the transport ban on its business. \"It will be serious for us and potentially for the consumer. We'll be twiddling our thumbs wondering what to do in a short time,\" said marketing director Alasdair Cox. Grampian, which employs 10,000 people is not contemplating redundancies. Hauliers Livestock hauliers feared the crisis could have a devastating effect on their business. Already suffering from fuel prices, many hauliers are ill-equipped to cope with a further blow, according to the Road Haulage Association. \"There are about 500 companies in the UK who earn their living from moving animals. They are facing a week without earnings. It's a matter of extreme concern to the whole industry, but everyone I've spoken to is convinced the ban is the responsible thing to do,\" a spokesperson said.

Livestock markets Livestock markets were facing a week without business, and while they supported the ban they were worried about the long term. \"If the ban lasts longer than a week, there are going to be serious cash-flow implications,\" said Peter Kingwell, of the Livestock Auctioneers' Association. \"They will become noticeable in the supermarkets in less than a week.\" Additional research by Max Houghton Talk about it What do you think?

The place is an eyesore, a disgrace.\"</p> <p>Yet it was the place where pigs arrived from all parts for fattening and were held for several weeks or months before being sent south for slaughter - a vital link in a complex, and potentially lethal national supply chain that may bring British farming to its knees.</p> <p>Yesterday two skeletal terriers, and a tethered horse in rather better shape, were the only sign of animal life at the centre run by a Sunderland man, Ronald Waugh.

A warning notice - \"Foot and mouth disease: please keep out\" - had been pinned to a gate the previous night alongside a neighbouring pig farm, run by Jim Brown. \"I can't comment,\" he said. \"It's just a precaution.\"</p> <p>Mr Leadbitter, who gave up pig rearing five years ago - \"if I'd kept going I'd be bankrupt now\" - blamed Europe for the latest farming crisis. \"I thought this would probably come.

Maybe someone was eating a ham sandwich, or something, with meat from abroad, and threw it into a field.\"</p> <p>Others were not so charitable. For some time, locals have complained about slurry leaking from the centre - which is dominated by a large green silo containing pig swill - and an all-pervading stench from the site.

Police believe the attack to be the work of animal rights activists opposed to research carried out by HLS.</p> <p>The laboratory, which uses 70,000 animals a year, has been the focus of the most concerted and effective campaign in the history of the animal rights movement.</p> <p>Two men and a third attacker, believed to be a woman, all wearing balaclavas and carrying baseball bats, set about Mr Cass as he got out of his car after driving the short distance from HLS to his home. He was struck on the head and received injuries to his arms as he fended off the blows. Two members of the public witnessed the incident and went to Mr Cass's defence. One of them was sprayed in the eyes with what police believe was CS gas.</p> <p>Mr Cass was taken to Hinchingbrooke hospital, Huntingdon, for stitches to a head wound. He returned to work yesterday afternoon. Mr Cass is the second senior HLS executive to be assaulted at his home in the last three months. In December a senior manager was attacked by two people at his home.</p> <p>After returning to work yesterday Mr Cass said: \"They beat me with baseball bats. I tried to protect myself but I was knocked over. I received quite a nasty gash on my head.</p> <p>\"I have always been careful. Unfortunately all people in our business need to exercise that level of care. All the work that we do is demanded by the government to improve safety to the public and human health.\"</p> <p>Cambridgeshire police described the attack as \"callous and cowardly\". A spokesman said: \"In recent months we have witnessed an escalation in the nature of attacks on people and property associated with Huntingdon Life Sciences. These events make us more determined to catch those who are responsible for these attacks.\"</p> <p>The attack is the latest incident in a concerted campaign to close the company, which employs more than 1,100 people in the UK. It gained momentum in late 1999 when a loose coalition of animal rights activists united under the banner Stop Huntingdon Life Cruelty (Shac) began campaigning to close the institution.</p> <p>Alongside these protests a campaign of intimidation and harassment was conducted. Employees, shareholders and supporters received death threats and hate mail, and incendiary devices were planted under cars. Shac has consistently denied involvement in any illegal methods of protest.</p> <p>Natasha Taylor of Shac said yesterday: \"We unreservedly condemn any act of violence be it against animals or humans. The campaign will go on until Huntingdon is closed.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.huntingdon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bioindustry.org\" target=\"_NEW\">UK Bioindustry Association<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.shac.net\" target=\"_NEW\">Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The managing director of Huntingdon Life Sciences, Europe's biggest contract animal research centre, was recovering yesterday after being attacked at his home by three masked people carrying baseball bats. Brian Cass, 52, was set upon shortly before 8pm on Thursday outside his home in St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Police believe the attack to be the work of animal rights activists opposed to research carried out by HLS. The laboratory, which uses 70,000 animals a year, has been the focus of the most concerted and effective campaign in the history of the animal rights movement. Two men and a third attacker, believed to be a woman, all wearing balaclavas and carrying baseball bats, set about Mr Cass as he got out of his car after driving the short distance from HLS to his home. He was struck on the head and received injuries to his arms as he fended off the blows. Two members of the public witnessed the incident and went to Mr Cass's defence. One of them was sprayed in the eyes with what police believe was CS gas. Mr Cass was taken to Hinchingbrooke hospital, Huntingdon, for stitches to a head wound. He returned to work yesterday afternoon. Mr Cass is the second senior HLS executive to be assaulted at his home in the last three months. In December a senior manager was attacked by two people at his home. After returning to work yesterday Mr Cass said: \"They beat me with baseball bats. I tried to protect myself but I was knocked over. I received quite a nasty gash on my head. \"I have always been careful. Unfortunately all people in our business need to exercise that level of care. All the work that we do is demanded by the government to improve safety to the public and human health.\" Cambridgeshire police described the attack as \"callous and cowardly\". A spokesman said: \"In recent months we have witnessed an escalation in the nature of attacks on people and property associated with Huntingdon Life Sciences. These events make us more determined to catch those who are responsible for these attacks.\" The attack is the latest incident in a concerted campaign to close the company, which employs more than 1,100 people in the UK. It gained momentum in late 1999 when a loose coalition of animal rights activists united under the banner Stop Huntingdon Life Cruelty (Shac) began campaigning to close the institution. Alongside these protests a campaign of intimidation and harassment was conducted. Employees, shareholders and supporters received death threats and hate mail, and incendiary devices were planted under cars. Shac has consistently denied involvement in any illegal methods of protest. Natasha Taylor of Shac said yesterday: \"We unreservedly condemn any act of violence be it against animals or humans. The campaign will go on until Huntingdon is closed.\" Useful links: Huntingdon Life Sciences UK Bioindustry Association Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty",

An x-ray caused wild excitement when it revealed not just the brooch but intricate detail of the gold inlay and the gems. While conservators spent weeks teasing the jewel free, archaeologists sifted through soil in the grave and found a missing tiny boss with a pinhead-sized cabuchon garnet. The jewel will go on display at the museum today. John Clark, Saxon curator, said similar brooches been found in Kent, probably from the same workshop, but others in Ipswich and Oxfordshire, suggesting a spreading influence through marriage of the Kent kings.",

Patricia Thompson, 34, successfully sued Sheffield fertility centre last year for breach of contract, winning a high court ruling that the clinic had disregarded her stated wishes. The clinic claimed that she had changed her mind and agreed to have three embryos implanted. She accepted the settlement of \u00a320,000 just before a high court hearing to decide whether she could claim the cost - up to \u00a3100,000 - of bringing up the third triplet. The House of Lords ruled in 1999 that public policy bars parents from claiming the cost of raising an \"unwanted\" child born as a result of medical negligence, but declined to decide whether different rules applied if the birth resulted from a breach of contract. A judge had been due to decide that point this week. Had it gone against Mrs Thompson she would have been compensated only for the extra pain and discomfort of carrying and delivering three babies rather than two - which would have been less than \u00a320,000. For this reason she accepted the settlement. Mrs Thompson, who was on legal aid, had turned down an offer of \u00a320,000 before the original high court hearing last November. The clinic, as the loser, would normally be expected to pay her legal costs. But because she rejected that offer and failed to win more after going to court, she is liable for her own costs. But her solicitors and barrister have agreed to trim their fees so she will keep most of the \u00a320,000. Her solicitor, Ben Gent, said she turned down the offer earlier because the clinic had refused to couple it with an acknowledgment that Mrs Thompson and her husband, Peter, 58, were telling the truth when they said they had insisted that only two embryos should be implanted. The Thompsons said: \"We fought this case because we believe no one should undergo medical treatment unless they give consent, whatever the treatment or the outcome, and we were subjected to the clinic's wishes being forced upon us. \"Rather than accept the clinic's offer of money before the high court case, we decided to go ahead with the hearing to prove they were wrong to treat us in that way.

She told the court that the effort of looking after three children, rather than two, was exhausting and expensive.

The very idea brings a glint of rage to the eye of chairman Werner Baldessarini. \"Casual Friday - this is a disaster,\" he snorts. \"Why should you come in on a Friday and say it's sporty Friday, so I'm going to wear a jogging suit?\" </p> <p>A trim, silver-haired figure, Baldessarini is elegantly turned out in a dark jacket with open-necked white shirt. \"I think I look good today,\" he says. \"Smart, but not too official.\" </p> <p>Hugo Boss has built its reputation, according to Baldessarini, by making \"men who are not so good looking look good\". That is about to change - after 78 years of dressing men, the German firm is turning its attention to women. </p> <p>The first range of Boss womenswear reached the stores this year. The clothes took three years to design, with planning for the project going back 10 years. </p> <p>Yet Baldessarini denies that the change is radical, saying: \"When we make clothes for men, we already think of women. The woman is very dominant in fashion - she often buys for the man. We have to see through the eyes of the woman.\" </p> <p>Boss's womenswear brochure contains simple designs, with an emphasis on black and white. Although the obvious customer is a young, professional woman, Baldessarini maintains the clothes are for all ages. In fact, he seems to have a penchant for older women. </p> <p>\"Your grandmother is not the same as my grandmother,\" he says. \"She is young, fresh, she wants to look good.

      "bodyText": "Dress-down Friday is not an option for staff at Hugo Boss's head office in Metzingen, near Stuttgart. The very idea brings a glint of rage to the eye of chairman Werner Baldessarini. \"Casual Friday - this is a disaster,\" he snorts. \"Why should you come in on a Friday and say it's sporty Friday, so I'm going to wear a jogging suit?\" A trim, silver-haired figure, Baldessarini is elegantly turned out in a dark jacket with open-necked white shirt. \"I think I look good today,\" he says. \"Smart, but not too official.\" Hugo Boss has built its reputation, according to Baldessarini, by making \"men who are not so good looking look good\". That is about to change - after 78 years of dressing men, the German firm is turning its attention to women. The first range of Boss womenswear reached the stores this year. The clothes took three years to design, with planning for the project going back 10 years. Yet Baldessarini denies that the change is radical, saying: \"When we make clothes for men, we already think of women. The woman is very dominant in fashion - she often buys for the man. We have to see through the eyes of the woman.\" Boss's womenswear brochure contains simple designs, with an emphasis on black and white. Although the obvious customer is a young, professional woman, Baldessarini maintains the clothes are for all ages. In fact, he seems to have a penchant for older women. \"Your grandmother is not the same as my grandmother,\" he says. \"She is young, fresh, she wants to look good. Things have changed - my grandmother stayed at home all the time.\" Warming to his theme, he continues: \"The word sexy for a grandmother was impossible until recently.\" Turning to his bemused PR man, Baldessarini demands: \"How is your grandmother?\" \"I don't have any grandmothers - they are dead,\" replies the PR man, triggering nervous sniggers all round.

      "bodyText": "Despite continued hard times for most technology stocks, Eidos, the video games publisher, has been tipped by some as a stock worth buying cheap, in anticipation of an explosion in the games console market. Some early estimates have predicted that combined sales of Sony's PlayStation2 and Microsoft's Xbox could quickly rise to as as much as 140m units a year. On the back of such forecasts, investment magazine Investors Chronicle yesterday named Eidos - which has 19 titles in development for PS2 and nine for Xbox - as a share tip of the week. As a result, the stock rose 19p yesterday to 274p. However, while the hi-tech heavyweights Sony and Microsoft prepare for mortal combat, their initial battlefield - the US - has entered a period of economic slowdown which is likely to hit the leisure retail sector harder than most. Some analysts still claim growth in global console sales could be 15-20% a year, but Laurent Gras, of Eidos's house broker Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, is more measured. He forecasts an increase for European and US sales - dampened by the slowdown - of just 8%. Furthermore, given the drought in sales last year, he suggests this would, at best, take revenues back to 1999 levels. That said, Eidos has worked hard to develop its catalogue and reduce its reliance on the successful Tomb Raider games series. Company results for the year to April - a period in which Eidos has issued three profits warnings - will undoubtedly make grim reading but up-beat analysts insist that the bad news is already built into the share price, and there may be good times ahead. Whether it will be an Eidos game that captures the public's imagination as the new-generation consoles appear in the high street remains to be seen. Certainly the company is as technically able to produce a soar-away success as any other publisher, but for investors it remains an extremely high risk stock.",

Joao Zamisa, head of planning at the National Institute for Disaster Management, said Mozambique needs more planes to evacuate people and transport food. \"We also need the reinforcement of resources for the rescue operations. Some of the boats are grounded because of lack of fuel,\" Mr Zamisa said. Only one helicopter was being used to rescue stranded people, while four others plus two fixed-wing aircraft were ferrying food and medicine to the 17,000 people now living in camps established by the government in flood-hit areas. Mr Zamisa said up to 10,000 people needed to be moved to safer areas as water levels in the region continue to rise. Mozambique has appealed for \u00a320m in aid as it battles against floods that have killed 41 people and affected nearly 400,000 people, including the 80,000 made homeless so far. The former Portuguese colony is still recovering from floods that killed about 700 people and made 500,000 people homeless last year. That flooding prompted one of the biggest aid and rescue missions in southern Africa. Since January, Mozambique has endured renewed flooding in the central Zambesi valley after several rivers burst their banks, affecting the provinces of Tete, Zambezia, Sofala and Manica. Mr Zamisa reported that chlorine was in short supply and that health conditions in the countryside and areas around towns were deteriorating fast because the rain had flooded wells. In a statement, the disaster management institute said that while this year's floods are not on the same scale as last year's a lot of work still has to be done in affected areas in order to stop the current emergency from turning into another catastrophe. The central Zambesi valley is bearing the brunt of this year's flooding, which has swept away homes and submerged thousands of hectares of farmland. The agriculture ministry estimates that 44,000 peasant farmers have been affected by the floodwaters, and that 27,000 hectares (67,000 acres) of crops have been lost, mainly staple foods such as maize, rice and cassava. Mr Zamisa said that heavy rains in neighbouring Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe threatened to swell the Zambesi, Pungoe, Revu\u00e9 and Ligonha rivers, which all flow into Mozambique. The planning chief said that the government was closely monitoring the situation near the port city of Beira, where the water levels of the Buzi and Save rivers were rising, also because of heavy rains in neighbouring Zimbabwe.",

      "body": "<p>With all that can be said, justly, against journalists, there is one kind of journalist to whom civilisation owes a very great debt, namely the brave and honest reporter who unearths and makes public unpleasant facts, cases of injustice, cruelty, corruption, which the authorities would like to keep hidden, and which even the average reader would prefer not to be compelled to think about. - WH Auden: A Certain World, 1970 </p> <p> Here is a question: is it ethical for a newspaper which campaigns for the reform of the libel laws to seek to use those laws to its advantage? Isn't that what a newspaper is doing when it says to its legal advisers, \"Yes, but will they sue?\" - and then takes a calculated risk that they will not, and goes ahead with publication? </p> <p>An element in the calculation may be the huge costs involved in pressing accusations of libel through the courts. To what extent should the nature of the person or organisation be considered? Is the importance of the story worth the risk? Is it a matter of imperative public interest? Do we believe that what we want to say is true? </p> <p>A few more questions: are the libel laws as they exist more a tool to be used by the rich or powerful to smother the legitimate activities of the intrepid reporter, described above by Auden, than a necessary way to protect the innocent? Or are they really, in their present, rigorous form, much stronger, for instance, than those in the United States, a necessary brake on an irresponsible press? </p> <p>Calculating the cost of defending and possibly losing libel actions in the English courts can induce dizzy spells. A newspaper's sense of purpose and resolve is tested in these sums. It has to be sure it is right. Many may believe - some Guardian journalists do - that the paper carries insurance against libel. It does not. It used to but the premiums themselves became punitive. When the paper goes to court to fight a libel action it does so knowing that the cost of losing (and sometimes the cost of winning) could represent a severe financial blow. </p> <p>We shall come back to the question with which I started in a minute, but an essential thing to know is that the decision to publish is the editor's alone, and never the lawyer's. Similarly, it is his decision whether to concede or fight in the face of accusations of libel. It was his decision to fight the libel actions unsuccessfully brought against the paper by the former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken.

      "bodyText": "With all that can be said, justly, against journalists, there is one kind of journalist to whom civilisation owes a very great debt, namely the brave and honest reporter who unearths and makes public unpleasant facts, cases of injustice, cruelty, corruption, which the authorities would like to keep hidden, and which even the average reader would prefer not to be compelled to think about. - WH Auden: A Certain World, 1970 Here is a question: is it ethical for a newspaper which campaigns for the reform of the libel laws to seek to use those laws to its advantage? Isn't that what a newspaper is doing when it says to its legal advisers, \"Yes, but will they sue?\" - and then takes a calculated risk that they will not, and goes ahead with publication? An element in the calculation may be the huge costs involved in pressing accusations of libel through the courts. To what extent should the nature of the person or organisation be considered? Is the importance of the story worth the risk? Is it a matter of imperative public interest? Do we believe that what we want to say is true? A few more questions: are the libel laws as they exist more a tool to be used by the rich or powerful to smother the legitimate activities of the intrepid reporter, described above by Auden, than a necessary way to protect the innocent? Or are they really, in their present, rigorous form, much stronger, for instance, than those in the United States, a necessary brake on an irresponsible press? Calculating the cost of defending and possibly losing libel actions in the English courts can induce dizzy spells. A newspaper's sense of purpose and resolve is tested in these sums. It has to be sure it is right. Many may believe - some Guardian journalists do - that the paper carries insurance against libel. It does not. It used to but the premiums themselves became punitive. When the paper goes to court to fight a libel action it does so knowing that the cost of losing (and sometimes the cost of winning) could represent a severe financial blow. We shall come back to the question with which I started in a minute, but an essential thing to know is that the decision to publish is the editor's alone, and never the lawyer's. Similarly, it is his decision whether to concede or fight in the face of accusations of libel. It was his decision to fight the libel actions unsuccessfully brought against the paper by the former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken. To take decisions of that kind you need great confidence in the journalists involved. Last week I described the way in which the paper is trying to ensure that everyone on the editorial staff has a basic knowledge of the law affecting journalism. The second of its sessions for newly arrived journalists took place this week, and there will soon be open masterclasses that all Guardian journalists will be able to attend. The idea, as I explained, is to see that individual journalists have reasonably efficient alarm systems, that they know, at least, when to exercise caution, and when to consult the very good legal advice that is always at hand. One of the paper's most experienced investigative journalists says that learning about the law, the laws of defamation, and those covering official secrecy and contempt in particular, is essential if the journalist is to fulfil one of his or her essential functions, which is to challenge these laws. \"When I started, journalism seemed to consist of finding out things that the lawyer then told you you couldn't put in the paper.

If this fact is too dismaying to contemplate, you have an annuals problem. If the dismay derives simply from the thought that all your planting will have to be done over again, you are overlooking a range of obliging plants which will indeed come back again, and in profusion. An obvious example is (no 41) the common Foxglove, Digitalis purpurea , which will seed itself and come back, being biennial, every other year, and will grow happily under trees and bushes. Excessive devotion to perennials would cut you off from this pleasure, as from the delights of (no 42) Honesty, Lunaria annua . Both the purple Honesty and the pink Foxglove have their white versions. Do you want to live without these? Do you want to live without Honesty? </p> <p>Another biennial which we allow to colonise a clump of blackthorns is the beautiful umbellifer, (no 43) Smyrnium perfoliatum . When it is performing, the upper part of the plant turns a yellowy green, so that a drift of Smyrnium gives the illusion of a pool of sunlight in a wood. </p> <p>A similar yellowy green is offered by another umbellifer, or annual herb for full sunlight, (no 44) Dill or Anethum graveoleus . It is a colour found useful by hip florists, who also turn to a self-sowing perennial, (no 45) Lady's Mantle or Alchemilla mollis . Chiltern Seeds offer a version of this called A. mollis \"Robustica\" , which is the one for cut flowers. </p> <p>And in the context of so much yellow, and such prolific self-sowing, I must mention a perennial member of the poppy family, Chelidonium majus , and its double version, (no 46) C. majus \"Flore Pleno\". Chelidonium , known as the Greater Celandine, is a flower of the hedgerow. My seed I collected outside Holy Trinity Church, Brompton Road, beloved of evangelical city slickers (the church, that is). The flower may be too evangelical for some tastes: it certainly spreads the word. </p> <p>If one was told of an annual which grew to around six feet, had flowers like pink coal-scuttles and smelt of 1950s hair oil, would the prospect be attractive? I like (no 47) Impatiens glandulifera , or, as Chiltern Seeds has it, I. roylei - Himalayan balsam - well enough. It reminds me of the banks of the Wear in Durham, with its exploding seed capsules.

One remembers the solemn way in which borders were edged with alternating plants of alyssum and lobelia. Yet (no 48) Sweet Alyssum, Lobularia maritima , grows happily enough when taken out of this context, and allowed to seed itself quietly in some crack or other, at the foot of a wall, or in some paving.

An American who has worked in South Africa for two decades, Ballen appears to have spent his time seeking out that country's most desperate, sorry individuals to photograph. From the remarkable documentary portraits of his early work to his more recent, cartoonishly stylised tableaux in the shacks of the poor, Ballen's images are compelling, powerful, haunting. </p> <p>It is not simply that Ballen has chosen to represent such abject poverty so unsparingly.

From the blank and drooling twins snapped in Western Transvaal in 1993 to the Deputy Dawg-like prison official with oversized features, they seem almost comically other. </p> <p>Outland, a new exhibition at the Shine Gallery in London, shows that in recent years, Ballen has moved away from naturalistic portraiture to a more metaphysical representation of \"the nature of chaos, death, my relationship between what I think I see and what exists\". The pictures feature ugly, wizened, almost ghoulish people. They wear masks, or clasp a knife or a kitten, framed by bare electrical wires or thrift-shop portraits of family members. If this is Ballen's metaphysical vision, it is a dark one indeed. </p> <p>The photographer has been heavily criticised in his adopted homeland for, he believes, exposing the myth of prosperous white South Africa: \"They show something that people don't want to see.\" Others claim he exploits those he photographs - wheeling out a succession of freaks and feeding on the morbid, repulsed fascination of his audience. It is a charge Ballen refutes with weary exasperation. \"In England, if I sat on the tube one day, I think 95% of the time I could come up with very similar images. I'm trying to find a universal class of people.\" </p> <p>He is frustrated that the image that has had the most positive response in his career is a simple portrait of a black labourer. \"People who don't understand my photography look at that one picture, and that's the only image they can relate to because it has a bit of romance to it. It doesn't ask too many questions.\" </p> <p>A New Yorker by birth, Ballen developed a love of photography in his teens when his mother worked with the legendary Magnum studio. After university he spent five years hitch-hiking around the world before settling in South Africa, where he met his future wife and was able to practise his other great love, geology. He earns his living in the mining trade and undertakes no commercial photography, but the two disciplines, he says, sit happily together. \"I look for mineral properties, evaluate them and make a feasibility study to determine whether it's viable to make a mine out of them. You're looking at the surface and trying to go below it. My photographs are very much about layered meaning.\" </p> <p>It is this meaning, says Ballen, that he wants to uncover, rather than making any commentary on the situation of the people he photographs. \"The questions I'm asking are not dealing with the issues of South African reality. They deal with more abstract, aesthetic issues. It is important that people understand that those are the type of questions I ask myself, rather than 'is white South Africa coping with the new regime?'.\" </p> <p>He sees himself in the tradition of Samuel Beckett or Francis Bacon, making dark representations of the human condition. But, he says, he is more open to criticism because he uses the naturalistic medium of photography. None of this quite lets Ballen off the hook, however. One photograph in Outland features three young men, all clearly with learning difficulties, posed in a grotesque dance holding vinyl singles and electrical wire. How involved were they in the creative process? The question is inescapable. Nor does his claim to be beyond politics ring entirely true: his decision to leave documentary photography came in 1994, just as apartheid ended and the representation of poor, dislocated white South Africans lost much of its ironic force. </p> <p>His response is hardly calculated to assuage liberal sensibilities: \"Sure, some of these people have disturbances, but I do what I can to help. They call me up all the time and ask me to come over. If they have a medical problem I'll do what I can to help.\" The last thing Ballen is interested in, in any case, is assuaging liberal sensibilities. \"I'm not a person who lives my life for social causes. I'm living my life for existential causes.\" </p> <p>As for exploitation: \"All I can say is, pick any 10 photos out of your newspaper and ask yourself, is the photographer exploiting the subject?

But he never lets you forget that Falstaff is also a profiteer who recruits 150 ragamuffins, con-temptuously dismisses them as \"food for powder\" and casually informs us that all but three have died in battle.

The cliched view of Prince Hal is that he is a calculating creep. But the beauty of William Houston's performance is that he shows a man torn between duty and desire. The high point comes in the role-playing tavern scene when he gives Falstaff due warning that he will have finally to reject him - at which point a desperate Barrit hammers on Houston's knees crying: \"Play out the play.\" What Houston gives us, most intelligently, is a long-term strategist seeking to extricate himself from a world of instant gratification. </p> <p>The presentation of these plays as part of an unfolding cycle also lends extra richness to David Troughton's massive Henry IV. As Bolingbroke in Richard II, he emerged as a shrewd political opportunist. What comes across here is his ability to re-write history and to persuade himself that it was his \"humility\" that won popular allegiance. Troughton's Henry remains a crafty politician to the end: when he urges Hal \"to busy giddy minds with foreign quarrels\" it might be George Bush senior talking to Dubya about Iraq. But Troughton also beautifully highlights the emotional constriction of a father who, at one point, yearns to embrace his son but who instead gives him a wary pat on the shoulder. </p> <p>Much could be said about this engrossing, six-hour experience: the Gloucestershire scenes, in particular, bring joyous tears to the eyes as Benjamin Whitrow's crumbling Shallow quietly patronises Peter Copley's lean, slippered and even more senile Silence.

Then we cut across to the public road close to the site of the long-vanished Cook's Study, former shooting lodge and observatory of the Stanhopes.

It states that Yorkshire Water, as freeholders of Snailsden Moor, wish to designate a linear footpath here, though the proposed route has yet to be finalized. The northern edge of the moor falls away to small headwater valleys draining to the Holme Valley, and they are enhanced by blocks of coniferous plantations around little reservoirs originally built to provide mill water. I remember a fine spring evening when we crossed in an almost straight line from Holme Moss to the rocky declivities of Ramsden Clough. Then we cut across to the public road close to the site of the long-vanished Cook's Study, former shooting lodge and observatory of the Stanhopes. The grouse were calling in the soft, slanting sunlight; a cuckoo sang far away towards Holme. We didn't, though, see any sign of the keeper or hear shouts to get off these precious sporting wastes.",

The US economy has slowed dramatically from its super-heated growth in recent years, while the financial crisis enveloping Turkey has once again put the spotlight on debt and inflation problems in emerging economies.</p> <p>The London stock market has now been directionless for close to two years, bubbling up towards 7,000 then falling back to 6,000. Only in recent days has it found that there are not many buyers even at 6,000.</p> <p>As the graph opposite shows, London shares are now among the worst performers in the world's stock markets, with the FTSE-100 showing a four-year record that puts it at the bottom of European bourses.</p> <p>\"People are feeling more cynical about shares at the moment,\" says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. \"Reasons to be cheerful are difficult to find and more people are staying away from the market.\"</p> <p>For small investors, the lack of direction in markets could not come at a worse time. February and March are traditionally the time of the year when money floods into Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) ahead of the end of the tax year, but this time more money is expected to stay in cash waiting for a new home.</p> <p>Last year, investors piled into technology funds - with disastrous consequences. According to Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the biggest investment advisers in the UK, there is no theme to investment this year. It lists Fidelity, led by its Managed International fund, as its current best seller, followed by Framlington Health, Aberdeen Global Champions and Gartmore European Focus.</p> <p>So what do the bulls and bears say about the year ahead for investors?</p> <p><b> The bear</b></p> <p>Excess credit, excess borrowing, deeply overpriced shares, ridiculous valuations; the London stock market is heading for a prolonged bear market similar to the decade-long decline in Tokyo after the bubble economy of the 80s, according to David Kauders of Kauders Portfolio Management.</p> <p>Mr Kauders has been in the investment wilderness for many years, but says his forecasts of long-term deflation are coming through. \"We are at the early stages of a very long drawn-out bear market. We've got to learn from the Japanese experience; we've got similar problems to the ones they had, it's just that they're not so visible right now because things have been temporarily fixed by easy credit.\"</p> <p>Mr Kauders has not bought shares since 1986, and does not even dabble in corporate bonds, usually seen as a safe haven during risky markets. Property is also heading fast into negative equity. Instead he splits investors' portfolios 60/40 between US Treasury bonds and British Government bonds, called gilts.</p> <p>\"My investors have had perfectly respectable growth and income, and should carry on doing so. If you bought a US Treasury bond yielding 9% in 1990, just think what sort of returns you are earning. Higher rate taxpayers should do a gilts Isa - buy direct, not through an Isa manager - but apart from them there's not a lot of point in taking out an Isa,\" he says.</p> <p><b> The bull</b></p> <p>Don't Worry, Be Happy is the tune from Legal &amp; General, one of the biggest investors in the London stock market. Its investment director, David Rough, who controls \u00a3114bn in investors' cash, says the market wobbles below 6,000 should not be a cause for undue concern, and predicts that by the end of 2001 the FTSE-100 will climb above its record high, ending up 20% at around 7,200.</p> <p>Profit warnings from big US and UK companies are currently depressing the market, but the worst will be out of the way by the end of the first quarter, predicts L&amp;G.</p> <p>It says that the UK is in fundamentally sound economic shape, but this is not being represented in stock markets. L&amp;G is particularly bullish about smaller companies, whose profits are insulated from an American downturn, unlike multinationals.</p> <p>It adds that because the London stock exchange has risen less rapidly than other markets over the past few years, it will also be less at risk from a severe correction downwards.</p>",

The US economy has slowed dramatically from its super-heated growth in recent years, while the financial crisis enveloping Turkey has once again put the spotlight on debt and inflation problems in emerging economies. The London stock market has now been directionless for close to two years, bubbling up towards 7,000 then falling back to 6,000. Only in recent days has it found that there are not many buyers even at 6,000. As the graph opposite shows, London shares are now among the worst performers in the world's stock markets, with the FTSE-100 showing a four-year record that puts it at the bottom of European bourses. \"People are feeling more cynical about shares at the moment,\" says Justin Urquhart Stewart of Barclays Stockbrokers. \"Reasons to be cheerful are difficult to find and more people are staying away from the market.\" For small investors, the lack of direction in markets could not come at a worse time. February and March are traditionally the time of the year when money floods into Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) ahead of the end of the tax year, but this time more money is expected to stay in cash waiting for a new home. Last year, investors piled into technology funds - with disastrous consequences. According to Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the biggest investment advisers in the UK, there is no theme to investment this year. It lists Fidelity, led by its Managed International fund, as its current best seller, followed by Framlington Health, Aberdeen Global Champions and Gartmore European Focus. So what do the bulls and bears say about the year ahead for investors? The bear Excess credit, excess borrowing, deeply overpriced shares, ridiculous valuations; the London stock market is heading for a prolonged bear market similar to the decade-long decline in Tokyo after the bubble economy of the 80s, according to David Kauders of Kauders Portfolio Management. Mr Kauders has been in the investment wilderness for many years, but says his forecasts of long-term deflation are coming through. \"We are at the early stages of a very long drawn-out bear market. We've got to learn from the Japanese experience; we've got similar problems to the ones they had, it's just that they're not so visible right now because things have been temporarily fixed by easy credit.\" Mr Kauders has not bought shares since 1986, and does not even dabble in corporate bonds, usually seen as a safe haven during risky markets. Property is also heading fast into negative equity. Instead he splits investors' portfolios 60/40 between US Treasury bonds and British Government bonds, called gilts. \"My investors have had perfectly respectable growth and income, and should carry on doing so. If you bought a US Treasury bond yielding 9% in 1990, just think what sort of returns you are earning. Higher rate taxpayers should do a gilts Isa - buy direct, not through an Isa manager - but apart from them there's not a lot of point in taking out an Isa,\" he says. The bull Don't Worry, Be Happy is the tune from Legal &amp; General, one of the biggest investors in the London stock market. Its investment director, David Rough, who controls \u00a3114bn in investors' cash, says the market wobbles below 6,000 should not be a cause for undue concern, and predicts that by the end of 2001 the FTSE-100 will climb above its record high, ending up 20% at around 7,200. Profit warnings from big US and UK companies are currently depressing the market, but the worst will be out of the way by the end of the first quarter, predicts L&amp;G. It says that the UK is in fundamentally sound economic shape, but this is not being represented in stock markets. L&amp;G is particularly bullish about smaller companies, whose profits are insulated from an American downturn, unlike multinationals. It adds that because the London stock exchange has risen less rapidly than other markets over the past few years, it will also be less at risk from a severe correction downwards.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Wednesday night will see one of Britain's more vulgar modern traditions as new car buyers count down the minutes to midnight so they can be first off the forecourt with the latest Y-registered cars. Sales are expected to be brisk: new car prices have fallen steeply over the past year in response to a \"buyers' strike\" over rip-off British prices.</p> <p>But souring the party was a damning report this week from the European Commission which revealed that despite high-profile price cuts, British drivers still pay far more than their EU cousins for nearly all makes of car. A Mazda 323 sells for \u00a35,307 in Denmark, but \u00a311,106 in the UK, or 99.3% more, while a Fiat Bravo, at \u00a39,997, is 94.2% more than in Denmark.</p> <p>However, the report focused on prices before tax, which is particularly severe in Denmark and which means that in reality Danish drivers pay more than Britons to drive away in a new car. By the same logic, British petrol is the best value in the EU, it's just that we pay high tax.</p> <p>So this week Jobs &amp; Money set out to find the best prices for new cars, inclusive of all the taxes and charges a buyer has to pay. First stop was <a href=\"http://www.carpricecheck.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Carpricecheck</a>, a website which independently compares prices from dealers, manufacturers, importers and internet e-tailers. Jobs &amp; Money asked it to find best prices on a range of cars plus we carried out independent checks at a number of traditional dealers.</p> <p>Lesson one is that list prices for cars are still substantially above the price you should pay, despite the adverts which proclaim hefty price reductions. Lesson two is that importers are still cheaper than buying domestically - but the differential is narrowing. Lesson three is that traditional dealers, while often at the bottom of the price league table, are by no means always the worst option and, if buying a luxury car, may be the cheapest.</p> <p><b> Importers</b><br></p> <p>Importers, led by <a href=\"http://www.oneswoop.com\" target=\"_NEW\">One Swoop</a>, topped the tables in five out of the six categories, knocking \u00a31,800 off the price of a Ford Focus and \u00a31,350 off a VW Golf. But they have a major drawback - delivery times can run up to four or even six months.</p> <p>Oneswoop marketing director Tom Buehlmann says that delivery can be as short as four weeks if buyers opt for selected models rather than demanding a long list of specifications. But he admits that delays are frustrating, and in some cases have worsened.</p> <p>\"Customised delivery averages around three months, and we are finding that manufacturers are being increasingly difficult, with some increasing their delivery times. The surcharge they require for right hand drive has also gone up in a number of cases, which is pretty unjustified,\" he says.</p> <p>The decline in UK list prices means that Oneswoop's price advantage has slipped. \"On March 1 last year, when the site launched, we averaged savings of 35%-40% off UK list prices, but that is now more like 20%. But that is still a very significant price gap, so there are large numbers of people trying the import route.\"</p> <p>A frequent concern about personal imports is that EU-sourced cars have warranties lasting just one year, while UK-sourced cars have three-year warranties. But Mr Buehlmann says this is simply scaremongering by UK dealers; all Oneswoop's cars come with three-year warranties.</p> <p><b> Internet e-tailers</b><br></p> <p>The new internet retailers of cars, such as Direct Line's <a href=\"http://www.jamjar.com\" target=\"_NEW\">JamJar</a>, are not as cheap as the importers - often \u00a3500-\u00a31,000 more - but promise delivery more rapidly, usually four weeks, but currently three months for Ford Focuses because of heavy demand.</p> <p>JamJar obtains its cars from Dixons Motors, the third biggest dealer in the UK. Its spokesman Justin Skinner says: \"Our focus is on UK supplied cars as we see a limited life span for the import route because UK car prices are coming down. Imports can take up to six months to deliver.\"</p> <p>The level of discount varies widely between different makes of car, and can be zero on some cars. For example, JamJar currently has big discounts on Vauxhall Astras, but is able to sell the Toyota Yaris at list price only. Under an EU-approved block exemption from usual competition rules, car manufacturers can still pick and choose who they want to sell to. \"They are still able to control prices, which cars we can sell, when and how. It's very much a supply driven rather than demand driven industry,\" says Mr Skinner.</p> <p>JamJar is campaigning against the renewal of the block exemption when it expires on October 1 2002, and says if it is lifted, new car prices will fall by an average of \u00a3500 and save British car buyers around \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p><b> Forecourt dealers</b><br></p> <p>In our survey, dealers came out badly, offering list prices only and in some cases even charging above list price. However, in the luxury car market they beat all other outlets, including the private importers. Carpricecheck.com was able to source a UK dealer offering a Jaguar S type at nearly \u00a33,000 below list price, while JamJar could only discount by \u00a3422.</p> <p>Haggling with dealers can bring prices down further, and arming yourself with price quotes from services such as carpricecheck.com gives the buyer added power. The company also recommends that drivers should start negotiations during the last 10 days of the month; its system reveals that better prices are offered in 61% of cases during the last few days of the month as dealers look to reach sales targets.</p> <p><b>Cover that costs more than a car</b></p> <p>Car insurance which costs substantially more than the value of your car? If you are under 25 and a first-time policy buyer, you'd better get used to it.</p> <p>This week Jobs &amp; Money sent out its editorial assistant Juliet Shedden to find the best quotes for a VW Polo her sister is giving her. The car is 13 years old, has high mileage and is worth, at most, \u00a31,000. Yet Ms Shedden was shocked to be given insurance quotes as high as \u00a31,500, while some insurers simply refused to offer cover.</p> <p>Ms Shedden is 23, lives in central London and therefore falls into the band of drivers that insurers appear to most dislike - the under 25s. \"I did a great deal of searching on the internet and telephone for insurance quotes and was pretty horrified at the quotes. The worst came from a company called Sabre, which wanted \u00a31,534.05. It's really made me think twice about whether I can afford to accept my sister's gift.\"</p> <p>It could have been worse. Young males are charged even more, says AA spokeswoman Rebecca Hadley. \"Young drivers are over-represented in accidents. One in six motorists is under 25 and one in four accidents involve someone under 25,\" she says. A recent AA study found that accidents involving young males are more serious than those involving young females, resulting in substantial personal injury claims. \"Young men's driving is worse when there are other males in the car, when they show off,\" says Ms Hadley, while female drivers are likely to drive carefully.</p> <p>Ms Shedden contacted 12 companies to find a decent quote. \"Churchill Insurance and Liverpool Victoria refused to give me a quote because of my age. Churchill's response was simply: \"We aren't competitive in that age bracket\" but they did recommend another insurer. I found <a href=\"http://www.find.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Find</a> useful as a website, although getting a 'quick quote online' took 20 minutes, with some sites not recognising my postal code and some crashing,\" she says.</p> <p>The majority of quotes were in the \u00a3700-\u00a31,000 bracket except for Admiral, which offered the best quote at \u00a3362.60 plus a 10-month accelerated no-claims bonus, after which premiums go down considerably. A spokesman for Admiral Insurance said they specialised in drivers under the age of 25, those who live in London and the south-east and female drivers.</p> <p>Young people on low incomes will want to spread payments over the year, but Ms Shedden found that this can add a further \u00a3100 to the bill. Many young drivers cut costs by insuring in their parents' home town even though the car is kept elsewhere, a practice the Association of British Insurers says is fraudulent, but difficult to detect and control.</p> <p><b>What under-25s pay</b></p> <p><b>Insurer</b> Third party fire &amp; theft | Fully comprehensive</p> <p><b>Admiral </b> \u00a3362.60 | \u00a3429.93</p> <p><b>Direct Line</b> \u00a3703.50 | \u00a3834.75</p> <p><b>Tesco</b> \u00a3703.50 | \u00a3834.75</p> <p><b>Groupama</b> \u00a3713.00 | \u00a3708.00</p> <p><b>People's Choice</b> \u00a3794.01 | \u00a3846.00</p> <p><b>AA Insurance</b> \u00a3861.68 | \u00a3844.68</p> <p><b>Eagle Star</b> \u00a3900.06 | \u00a3890.00</p> <p><b>Insureegg.com</b> \u00a3939.50 | \u00a3979.50</p> <p><b>Sabre Insurance </b> \u00a3936.60 | \u00a31,534.00</p> <p><b> Plan your route to a cheap loan</b></p> <p>Need cash to help finance a new Y-reg car? Picking the wrong finance package can add thousands of pounds to the cost of a car, particularly if you opt for expensive \"payment protection\" deals.</p> <p>Northern Rock topped the tables for cheapest loan rates when Jobs &amp; Money checked out finance deals for X-reg cars, but recently it has been beaten by Chartered Trust Platinum.</p> <p>We asked lenders for monthly repayments on a \u00a35,000 car loan spread over three years. Chartered Trust Platinum (0870 606 1732), a subsidiary of Lloyds TSB, charges \u00a3158.41 per month without insurance (APR 9.1), making a total payment of \u00a35,702.76. Northern Rock's \u00a3159.05 per month (APR 9.4) adds up to \u00a35,725.80 over the three years. Lombard Direct, Nationwide, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Vivid all offer APRs below 10%.</p> <p>Propping up the table are some big names: Lloyds TSB's car purchase loan has an APR of 15.9, with total payments of \u00a36,226.20 over three years, or \u00a3523.44 more than Chartered's loan - even though it too is in the Lloyds empire. Halifax, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclayloan and Birmingham Midshires all have APRs of more than 15.</p> <p>All loan applicants are vetted through credit scoring systems, so if you have suffered repayment problems the low-cost deals will be closed to you.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday night will see one of Britain's more vulgar modern traditions as new car buyers count down the minutes to midnight so they can be first off the forecourt with the latest Y-registered cars. Sales are expected to be brisk: new car prices have fallen steeply over the past year in response to a \"buyers' strike\" over rip-off British prices. But souring the party was a damning report this week from the European Commission which revealed that despite high-profile price cuts, British drivers still pay far more than their EU cousins for nearly all makes of car. A Mazda 323 sells for \u00a35,307 in Denmark, but \u00a311,106 in the UK, or 99.3% more, while a Fiat Bravo, at \u00a39,997, is 94.2% more than in Denmark. However, the report focused on prices before tax, which is particularly severe in Denmark and which means that in reality Danish drivers pay more than Britons to drive away in a new car. By the same logic, British petrol is the best value in the EU, it's just that we pay high tax. So this week Jobs &amp; Money set out to find the best prices for new cars, inclusive of all the taxes and charges a buyer has to pay. First stop was Carpricecheck, a website which independently compares prices from dealers, manufacturers, importers and internet e-tailers. Jobs &amp; Money asked it to find best prices on a range of cars plus we carried out independent checks at a number of traditional dealers. Lesson one is that list prices for cars are still substantially above the price you should pay, despite the adverts which proclaim hefty price reductions. Lesson two is that importers are still cheaper than buying domestically - but the differential is narrowing. Lesson three is that traditional dealers, while often at the bottom of the price league table, are by no means always the worst option and, if buying a luxury car, may be the cheapest. Importers Importers, led by One Swoop, topped the tables in five out of the six categories, knocking \u00a31,800 off the price of a Ford Focus and \u00a31,350 off a VW Golf. But they have a major drawback - delivery times can run up to four or even six months. Oneswoop marketing director Tom Buehlmann says that delivery can be as short as four weeks if buyers opt for selected models rather than demanding a long list of specifications. But he admits that delays are frustrating, and in some cases have worsened. \"Customised delivery averages around three months, and we are finding that manufacturers are being increasingly difficult, with some increasing their delivery times. The surcharge they require for right hand drive has also gone up in a number of cases, which is pretty unjustified,\" he says. The decline in UK list prices means that Oneswoop's price advantage has slipped. \"On March 1 last year, when the site launched, we averaged savings of 35%-40% off UK list prices, but that is now more like 20%. But that is still a very significant price gap, so there are large numbers of people trying the import route.\" A frequent concern about personal imports is that EU-sourced cars have warranties lasting just one year, while UK-sourced cars have three-year warranties. But Mr Buehlmann says this is simply scaremongering by UK dealers; all Oneswoop's cars come with three-year warranties. Internet e-tailers The new internet retailers of cars, such as Direct Line's JamJar, are not as cheap as the importers - often \u00a3500-\u00a31,000 more - but promise delivery more rapidly, usually four weeks, but currently three months for Ford Focuses because of heavy demand. JamJar obtains its cars from Dixons Motors, the third biggest dealer in the UK. Its spokesman Justin Skinner says: \"Our focus is on UK supplied cars as we see a limited life span for the import route because UK car prices are coming down. Imports can take up to six months to deliver.\" The level of discount varies widely between different makes of car, and can be zero on some cars. For example, JamJar currently has big discounts on Vauxhall Astras, but is able to sell the Toyota Yaris at list price only. Under an EU-approved block exemption from usual competition rules, car manufacturers can still pick and choose who they want to sell to. \"They are still able to control prices, which cars we can sell, when and how. It's very much a supply driven rather than demand driven industry,\" says Mr Skinner. JamJar is campaigning against the renewal of the block exemption when it expires on October 1 2002, and says if it is lifted, new car prices will fall by an average of \u00a3500 and save British car buyers around \u00a31bn a year. Forecourt dealers In our survey, dealers came out badly, offering list prices only and in some cases even charging above list price. However, in the luxury car market they beat all other outlets, including the private importers. Carpricecheck.com was able to source a UK dealer offering a Jaguar S type at nearly \u00a33,000 below list price, while JamJar could only discount by \u00a3422. Haggling with dealers can bring prices down further, and arming yourself with price quotes from services such as carpricecheck.com gives the buyer added power. The company also recommends that drivers should start negotiations during the last 10 days of the month; its system reveals that better prices are offered in 61% of cases during the last few days of the month as dealers look to reach sales targets. Cover that costs more than a car Car insurance which costs substantially more than the value of your car? If you are under 25 and a first-time policy buyer, you'd better get used to it. This week Jobs &amp; Money sent out its editorial assistant Juliet Shedden to find the best quotes for a VW Polo her sister is giving her. The car is 13 years old, has high mileage and is worth, at most, \u00a31,000. Yet Ms Shedden was shocked to be given insurance quotes as high as \u00a31,500, while some insurers simply refused to offer cover. Ms Shedden is 23, lives in central London and therefore falls into the band of drivers that insurers appear to most dislike - the under 25s. \"I did a great deal of searching on the internet and telephone for insurance quotes and was pretty horrified at the quotes. The worst came from a company called Sabre, which wanted \u00a31,534.05. It's really made me think twice about whether I can afford to accept my sister's gift.\" It could have been worse. Young males are charged even more, says AA spokeswoman Rebecca Hadley. \"Young drivers are over-represented in accidents. One in six motorists is under 25 and one in four accidents involve someone under 25,\" she says. A recent AA study found that accidents involving young males are more serious than those involving young females, resulting in substantial personal injury claims. \"Young men's driving is worse when there are other males in the car, when they show off,\" says Ms Hadley, while female drivers are likely to drive carefully. Ms Shedden contacted 12 companies to find a decent quote. \"Churchill Insurance and Liverpool Victoria refused to give me a quote because of my age. Churchill's response was simply: \"We aren't competitive in that age bracket\" but they did recommend another insurer. I found Find useful as a website, although getting a 'quick quote online' took 20 minutes, with some sites not recognising my postal code and some crashing,\" she says. The majority of quotes were in the \u00a3700-\u00a31,000 bracket except for Admiral, which offered the best quote at \u00a3362.60 plus a 10-month accelerated no-claims bonus, after which premiums go down considerably. A spokesman for Admiral Insurance said they specialised in drivers under the age of 25, those who live in London and the south-east and female drivers. Young people on low incomes will want to spread payments over the year, but Ms Shedden found that this can add a further \u00a3100 to the bill. Many young drivers cut costs by insuring in their parents' home town even though the car is kept elsewhere, a practice the Association of British Insurers says is fraudulent, but difficult to detect and control.

Picking the wrong finance package can add thousands of pounds to the cost of a car, particularly if you opt for expensive \"payment protection\" deals. Northern Rock topped the tables for cheapest loan rates when Jobs &amp; Money checked out finance deals for X-reg cars, but recently it has been beaten by Chartered Trust Platinum. We asked lenders for monthly repayments on a \u00a35,000 car loan spread over three years. Chartered Trust Platinum (0870 606 1732), a subsidiary of Lloyds TSB, charges \u00a3158.41 per month without insurance (APR 9.1), making a total payment of \u00a35,702.76. Northern Rock's \u00a3159.05 per month (APR 9.4) adds up to \u00a35,725.80 over the three years. Lombard Direct, Nationwide, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Vivid all offer APRs below 10%. Propping up the table are some big names: Lloyds TSB's car purchase loan has an APR of 15.9, with total payments of \u00a36,226.20 over three years, or \u00a3523.44 more than Chartered's loan - even though it too is in the Lloyds empire. Halifax, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclayloan and Birmingham Midshires all have APRs of more than 15. All loan applicants are vetted through credit scoring systems, so if you have suffered repayment problems the low-cost deals will be closed to you. Northern Rock, however, insists that its loan rates are available to 98% of applicants. Beware: you will be encouraged to take out expensive payment protection - call centres always give the \"with insurance\" price first. In some cases this can add 15% to the total repayment costs. There are alternatives to personal loans; deferred car purchase, hire purchase and personal contract plans. Deferred car purchase, offered by Alliance &amp; Leicseter, Direct Line and NatWest, allows you to buy a swanky car without huge monthly payments, but the catch is a chunky final payment. Hire purchase is a decreasingly popular option. The finance is secured on the car, so it may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments. Personal contract plans, offered by manufacturers and big dealers, give a low initial monthly payment plus a minimum guaranteed future value, and are most useful when buying a high price car with a high resale value.

A secret police source said he suspected that senior education officials in Moscow were involved.</p> <p>A glimpse into Ms Fratti's world has been given by La Repubblica, the Italian daily, which reported that she was an orphan who was adopted.

Because of that, there was lots of abuse of the system. \"There's a huge number of foreign agencies from most European countries operating here, from New Zealand, Canada, Israel, and around 90 from the US,\" said Vladimir Ustinov, the prosecutor general. \"They're turning adoption into a market. Cases of inhuman treatment of Russian children by foreign citizens are frequent.\" The popular tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda proclaimed this week: \"Our bureaucrats are sending healthy children for foreign adoption while potential Russian adopters are being offered invalids.\" The authorities keep a databank of 80,000 children available for adoption and in theory there have to be three Russian refusals on a given child before he or she can be adopted by a foreigner. In practice, as is alleged to be the case with Ms Fratti, orphanage directors, local education officials and judges demand and receive bribes from the foreigners. A Russian television documentary on the Volgograd scandal, to be screened on Monday, will demand to know what has happened to the 600 children, and imply that they have fallen into \"bad hands\", though there is no evidence of anything untoward happening to any of the 600-plus children involved in the Fratti case. Mr Romodanov, the Volgograd orphanage director, enjoys a good reputation in the city as a caring and skilled child expert. \"If we had had any doubts about this woman, we would never have cooperated with her,\" he said. But Russian investigators say they have already examined 200 of the 600-plus cases and found fiddled paperwork in 173 cases. A secret police source said he suspected that senior education officials in Moscow were involved. A glimpse into Ms Fratti's world has been given by La Repubblica, the Italian daily, which reported that she was an orphan who was adopted. She is quoted as saying that she knew \"in her heart the best thing for abandoned children\".",

And in trying to break out of all the old barriers, we ended up pulling them down altogether.\"</p> <p>Now an MEP for the French Green party, Mr Cohn-Bendit has been severely embarrassed by the resurfacing of an article he published in 1975 about the \"erotic\" nature of his contacts with children at an alternative kindergarten in Frankfurt, where he lived and worked after being kicked out of France for his part in May 68.</p> <p>\"Certain children opened the flies of my trousers and started to tickle me,\" he wrote. \"I reacted differently each time, according to the circumstances ... But when they insisted on it, I then caressed them.\"</p> <p>Mr Cohn-Bendit has insisted that the passages \"bear no relationship to reality\", that he has never been a paedophile, and that the article - taken from a book, Le Grand Bazar - was \"a product of its time, of our anti-authoritarianism; pure provocation, designed to shock the bourgeoisie\".</p> <p>At the time, the book and Mr Cohn-Bendit's TV appearances to discuss it, got critical acclaim.</p> <p>Some 20 children then in his care, now in their 30s, and their parents have written an open letter in his support, and Frankfurt prosecutors said yesterday there was \"quite clearly\" no case to answer.</p> <p>But some at the time went further. Writer Tony Duvert praised \"the great adventure of paedophilia\" and raged at \"the fascism of mothers\". Philosopher Ren\u00e9 Scherrer urged \"the removal of all sexual taboos - nothing should be outlawed\".</p> <p>Across the Rhine, the reassessment of May 68 is all about politics and violence. Mr Cohn-Bendit's close friend and fellow 70s radical Joschka Fischer, now Germany's foreign minister, is under fire over footage showing him striking a policeman. He also faces a judicial investigation into allegations that he lied about contacts with suspected terrorists in the 70s.</p> <p>In France, the debate is more about sex. \"Cohn-Bendit should resign, and he should do it now,\" declared Philippe de Villiers, a senior conservative. \"For how many paedophiles have his appalling statements served as justification, or even encouragement?\"</p> <p>One signatory of the 1977 petition, Philippe Sollers, admitted yesterday that \"there were so many manifestos, we signed them almost automatically\". What shocked him now, he said, was that \"the whole problem of violence against children was simply not a social problem at the time\", but is now.</p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration, the left-leaning French newspaper that emerged from the barricades of 68, devoted four pages to the issue yesterday. It pointed out that in the 70s, French leftists held \"a very serious debate about whether parents should leave their bedroom door open when they were having sex\".</p> <p>May 68 did not invent paedophilia, said Lib\u00e9ration's editor Serge July. \"The existing moral order was the enemy,\" he said. \"The cultural revolution that followed May 68 was a social triumph in many, many ways. But its discourse on the sexuality of children has served to legitimise practices that are, at times, criminal.\"</p>",

And in trying to break out of all the old barriers, we ended up pulling them down altogether.\" Now an MEP for the French Green party, Mr Cohn-Bendit has been severely embarrassed by the resurfacing of an article he published in 1975 about the \"erotic\" nature of his contacts with children at an alternative kindergarten in Frankfurt, where he lived and worked after being kicked out of France for his part in May 68. \"Certain children opened the flies of my trousers and started to tickle me,\" he wrote. \"I reacted differently each time, according to the circumstances ... But when they insisted on it, I then caressed them.\" Mr Cohn-Bendit has insisted that the passages \"bear no relationship to reality\", that he has never been a paedophile, and that the article - taken from a book, Le Grand Bazar - was \"a product of its time, of our anti-authoritarianism; pure provocation, designed to shock the bourgeoisie\". At the time, the book and Mr Cohn-Bendit's TV appearances to discuss it, got critical acclaim. Some 20 children then in his care, now in their 30s, and their parents have written an open letter in his support, and Frankfurt prosecutors said yesterday there was \"quite clearly\" no case to answer. But some at the time went further. Writer Tony Duvert praised \"the great adventure of paedophilia\" and raged at \"the fascism of mothers\". Philosopher Ren\u00e9 Scherrer urged \"the removal of all sexual taboos - nothing should be outlawed\". Across the Rhine, the reassessment of May 68 is all about politics and violence. Mr Cohn-Bendit's close friend and fellow 70s radical Joschka Fischer, now Germany's foreign minister, is under fire over footage showing him striking a policeman. He also faces a judicial investigation into allegations that he lied about contacts with suspected terrorists in the 70s. In France, the debate is more about sex. \"Cohn-Bendit should resign, and he should do it now,\" declared Philippe de Villiers, a senior conservative. \"For how many paedophiles have his appalling statements served as justification, or even encouragement?\" One signatory of the 1977 petition, Philippe Sollers, admitted yesterday that \"there were so many manifestos, we signed them almost automatically\". What shocked him now, he said, was that \"the whole problem of violence against children was simply not a social problem at the time\", but is now. Lib\u00e9ration, the left-leaning French newspaper that emerged from the barricades of 68, devoted four pages to the issue yesterday. It pointed out that in the 70s, French leftists held \"a very serious debate about whether parents should leave their bedroom door open when they were having sex\". May 68 did not invent paedophilia, said Lib\u00e9ration's editor Serge July. \"The existing moral order was the enemy,\" he said. \"The cultural revolution that followed May 68 was a social triumph in many, many ways. But its discourse on the sexuality of children has served to legitimise practices that are, at times, criminal.\"",

And isn't there some sort of Celeb Complaints Council we can petition to take her off it, and out of our faces forever? </p> <p>On the whole, we're pretty tolerant of our celebs over here. We tend not to shoot 'em (John Lennon) or have special vans fitted out with torture chambers in which to put them to a gory end (Steven Spielberg). We realise that these sad souls have something missing in their lives that stops them from being content with the normal amount of love that most of us make do with from our friends and families; we are patient as they show us their tits, take off their knickers and blame their quite grotesque neediness on the fact that they once saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus when they were six years old. </p> <p>But in return for our gracious forbearance, we ask that they have a little something going for them - just a little. They don't have to be rocket scientists, or even great at what they do, but a bit of charm and a bit of style never goes amiss. Catherine Zeta-Jones, say, or Martine McCutcheon are good examples of celebs towards whom there is enormous public goodwill. This is not so much for their characters or their talents - which may or may not turn out to be remarkable; the signs in both cases are good - but for their guts, their glamour and their pizazz. No matter how radiantly beautiful they look and what credits they rack up, they retain the common touch; both from underprivileged backgrounds, they tell their tales of woe with wry humour and move on to the next thing. And we cheer them. </p> <p>On the other hand, most of us feel confused and rather resentful when we see \"celebrities\" paid vast sums of money out of our pockets, via the television licence, who are actually about as celebrated as syphilis. And we feel the same perplexed vexation when we are asked to admire \"personalities\" who have all the sheer molten magnetism of a dressing doll. Andy Warhol prepared us for the day when everyone would be famous for 15 minutes - but he couldn't have imagined these dog-days, when celebrities are uncelebrated and personalities have none, but plug on nevertheless as though they were Marilyn Monroe, Mahatma Gandhi and Limahl all rolled into one. </p> <p>No one sums up this species of celebrity better than Vanessa Feltz.

In any decade before the 90s, she'd have been \"safe\"; she wouldn't have dreamed of apeing the hundreds of under-qualified girls who attempt to jostle their way into the sad bordellos of showbiz, using their beauty the way a young, working-class boxer uses his fists - to get out. </p> <p>But in the 90s, when Helen Mirren and the Women's Institute got their kit off for the hacks, everyone threw caution to the wind. Call it pre- millennial hysteria if you like - whatever, this well- educated, middle-aged housewife was suddenly acting like Denise van Outen, banging on about her brilliant sex life and altogether giving us more information than we needed. Who exactly was it at the BBC who decided she was just what the doctor ordered to send the daytime ratings rocketing? Whatever, millions of pounds of public money were thrown at her. </p> <p> Feltz signifies far beyond her immediate self in another thing; she was vastly over-qualified for the job she took on, namely that of on-air agony aunt, leading the chorus of woe from the council estates. (Not just over-qualified but temperamentally unsuited for the compassion racket, perhaps; this is a woman who so begrudged her widowed father his happiness with his second wife that she didn't speak to him for years on end.) In the contempt she showed her guests, we saw the sour whine of the Blair-led graduate, who is qualified up to the eyeballs and just can't believe they have to deal with the common herd as they serve them in Starbucks. Not surprisingly, the public reacted by switching off. </p> <p>Feltz lost both her billet and her husband and set about \"reinventing\" herself - that other great buzzword of our time. She lost a lot of weight, and that is now her thing; once famous for being fat, she is now famous for being thin. What will she do when this ceases to be a selling point? At what point will this educated and cultured woman choose to set herself some other goal than being a human hula hoop? Does she ever wonder why she bothered swotting for that First? How many years of higher education does it take to be photographed wearing a vat of whipped cream and a shell-shocked smile? </p> <p>When Feltz was fat, she gloated about it; now she's thin, she gloats about that. But being thin is nothing to be proud of - any more than being fat is. (And no guarantee of beauty, either - who's the cutest, Sophie Dahl at size 16, Feltz at size 12 or Calista Flockhart at size 8?) It's amazing, isn't it, that someone can have a Cambridge First and still not realise that pride should be what we attach to our achievements, not our measurements. </p> <p>Fat or thin, married or single, Feltz remains a chilling warning to the rest of us fat, middle-aged types about the vast vistas of humiliation which await us if we really start believing that looks matter more than books.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Buying a new car is clearly a big decision. You need to do a lot of detailed research, comparing urban cycle mpg, depreciation costs and load-carrying capacity across a wide range of cars. And then, when you've finished all this research, you get the car you fancied in the first place, even if it has the mpg of an armoured personnel carrier and the depreciation of a dot.com share. </p> <p>It's always a good idea to test drive a new car. It's called a test drive because you suddenly feel as if you're doing your driving test again. The 10 minutes you have in the car will be the worst 10 minutes of driving you've done since you were with your dad in Sainsbury's car park. </p> <p>And it doesn't help that the salesman will be pointing out the superb road-holding as you accidentally mount a kerb because you can't find the clutch. It's much better just to sit in the driver's seat in the showroom, hold the wheel tightly and make quiet vrooming noises. </p> <p>At some stage, the salesman might lift the bonnet for you to have a look at the engine. It's very difficult to know what to say at this stage, as you feel as if a waiter has taken you to have a look at the kitchen.

      "bodyText": "Buying a new car is clearly a big decision. You need to do a lot of detailed research, comparing urban cycle mpg, depreciation costs and load-carrying capacity across a wide range of cars. And then, when you've finished all this research, you get the car you fancied in the first place, even if it has the mpg of an armoured personnel carrier and the depreciation of a dot.com share. It's always a good idea to test drive a new car. It's called a test drive because you suddenly feel as if you're doing your driving test again. The 10 minutes you have in the car will be the worst 10 minutes of driving you've done since you were with your dad in Sainsbury's car park. And it doesn't help that the salesman will be pointing out the superb road-holding as you accidentally mount a kerb because you can't find the clutch. It's much better just to sit in the driver's seat in the showroom, hold the wheel tightly and make quiet vrooming noises. At some stage, the salesman might lift the bonnet for you to have a look at the engine. It's very difficult to know what to say at this stage, as you feel as if a waiter has taken you to have a look at the kitchen. Just say something like, 'So that's where they put it', and then ask to see something useful, such as how you get the filler cap off.

And the barbecue last night were an insult.\"</p> <p>There are no inflatable bananas in the waters of our beach - only fishermen, pelicans and laughing gulls. The surf thunders below our windows like artillery. I sit on the balcony feeding watermelon to blue birds. Behind us the deep, dark rainforest creeps up the mountainside. Before us the sea glitters all day, then turns to mercury at dusk. I am mesmerised. There are bananas, but they are not inflatable. They are tiny and called \"fig\". They taste of the Garden of Eden. But is there a serpent here? We go down to lunch wondering if the sous-chef will run amok with his chopper.

The beautiful waitress tells me the best place to see birds is under the yellow tree by the swimming pool, at dawn or dusk. At dusk I am there, training my binoculars on a ruby-topaz hummingbird, when Harold of Doncaster strolls up, drying his paunch.</p> <p>\"This swimming pool's an insult,\" he informs me.</p> <p>\"So are the hummingbirds,\" I reply. \"Deeply disappointing.\"</p> <p>He doesn't hear. He doesn't listen. \"I've got a friend in Planning,\" Harold confides. \"He'd have a nervous breakdown if he could see what goes on here.\"</p> <p>Night falls with merciful swiftness. We return to our rooms and dress for dinner: gleaming white fish, grilled with lime juice, and crisp, cinnamon-scented pumpkin fritters, etc. An excellent local band plays. The English dance, tentatively, like people taking medicine or being brave - they dance like damaged automata on the Antiques Roadshow.</p> <p>\"That's nowt,\" remarks Harold in passing. \"You should've seen the limbo dancer we had in Barbados. Gold lam\u00e9 shorts, the lot.\"</p> <p>Next afternoon, we go to a small hotel called Arnos Vale, where they feed the birds at teatime on a high white veranda overlooking the distant sea. First a crowd of big, brown, pheasant-like creatures come. They are cocricos - the national emblem. \"Cocrico!\" they shout, unsurprisingly. They gobble up most of the grub, and disappear. Other, smaller birds arrive. But the star waits until it is very late and shady - about 5pm. Then the motmots arrive. The big star turn. An iridescent blue head, a soft green velvety back, a blushing russet breast, and a great long tail like a pair of tennis racquets. The motmot says little.

      "body": "<p>Many British people won't eat veal because they regard it as one of the cruellest of all meats in terms of its production. At the root of our objections lies the dominant production system on the continent, where flavourless white veal is cheap and ubiquitous, its pallid tenderness achieved by abruptly and prematurely separating calves from their mothers at birth, then confining them entirely indoors in small crates with slatted floors and no room to turn around. There, they are fed only on milk powder and water, and kept in a permanent state of anaemia until they are slaughtered. No wonder we call for a boycott. </p> <p>However, such objections are mainly historical. The veal crate will be banned throughout Europe by 2007, and is already illegal in the UK. Also, many consumers remain unaware that every day on British dairy farms thousands of veal calves are shot dead simply because they have no commercial value. </p> <p>And there, in a nutshell, is the problem. The milk we drink comes from cows that are kept pregnant and in calf so they will lactate. Their female offspring are reared as the next generation of milkers, but what about the male calves? Before BSE, many of our bull calves were exported live to factory farms on the continent, where they were reared and slaughtered as white veal. Thankfully, BSE regulations put paid to that particularly repellent trade - although a further consequence of BSE is that there is now no market for more mature beef from the dairy herd, which is where the disease originated. Consumers today want young beef from dedicated beef animals (suckler herds), not second-grade dairy beef. So dairy farms up and down the land are either selling their male calves solely for their skins or are just routinely shooting them and then burning the carcasses. \"It is most depressing,\" one farmer told me. \"You're up helping the cow to calf at night, then shooting her offspring in the morning.\" </p> <p>If those calves were raised humanely for meat, however, this practice might well stop. Most conventional farmers see no future in veal, but organic farmers are beginning to look for ways to avoid this enormously wasteful slaughter, not least as its scale has grown commensurately with the boom in demand for organic milk. Helen Browning, for example, has been producing veal on Eastbrook, her organic farm in Wiltshire, for the past five years. Here, the calf stays with its mother for the first few days after birth and is then \"mothered up\" with and suckled by an older dairy cow (a sort of bovine wet-nurse system), until it is slaughtered at about five months of age. In that time, the calf is free-ranging, usually outdoors, and has ready access to natural feedstuffs such as oats and hay. This way, it has a healthy diet and a decent life, albeit short. </p> <p>This approach results in ros\u00e9 veal meat, the premium type of veal that is known in France as \"veau sous la m\u00e8re\" - the meat has a pale, rosy hue, because the calf has eaten a varied, natural diet; a slightly firmer texture, because the calf has been able to exercise; and also a better, more beefy flavour. </p> <p>But the very concept of \"high- welfare\" veal is, for many consu-mers in Britain at least, a complete contradiction in terms, albeit one predicated entirely on a basic lack of understanding. \"We had plans to market veal from other organic farms,\" says Helen Browning, \"but we have found that we are struggling with marketing even our own. If we saw orders pick up, that would give us confidence and we'd scale up our production.\" More than anything, it seems, while consumers can recognise the vast difference between, say, the raising of a broiler chicken and its organic, free-range counterpart, the generic term \"veal\" seems to evoke a blanket prejudice. </p> <p>We are creatures of habit, too. While Italian cooks automatically turn to veal mince for a lasagne, or to veal shin for osso buco, the meat is far more unfamiliar to British consumers. That's hardly surprising, as only a few independent butchers sell the slightly more welfare-friendly meat from \"loose-house\" systems, in which, though the calves are kept indoors, they are not crated. Even supermarkets sell such veal only in minuscule volumes. Otherwise, veal is used mainly by restaurants of a classical French inclination, none of which can properly function without a bubbling stock pot of \"fonds bruns\" based on veal bones. </p> <p>It is, then, a matter of education if the British consumer is ever going to understand that there are as many nuances in the production of veal as there are in any other meat. The only veal \"abstainers\" who really show a consistent and logical position in the whole debate are vegans - their forgoing of dairy products is based on the fact that they believe dairy farming is intrinsically cruel, not least because calves are taken away from their mothers prematurely so that poor old Daisy can be milked to exhaustion. </p> <p>The rest of us, on the other hand, seem to be suffering from a large dose of hypocrisy - or, to put it more charitably, confusion - that we really ought to confront: if we drink milk, we should be prepared to eat at least some veal, otherwise we are first contributing to and then turning a blind eye to (if not condoning) one of modern farming's most unpleasant and profligate practices</p>",

      "body": "<p>Bruce Oldfield? John Rocha? Philippe Starck? Not the sort of names you'd usually associate with mass-market show homes. What springs to mind is an overdressed brick box, decorated in Barbara Cartland pinks and screaming aquamarines; all swags, frills and wallpaper borders, bowls of simulated vegetables and, eek!, potpourri. </p> <p>But these trumped-up marketing suites are now being styled by top-name designers in bold, cutting-edge schemes. \"We are selling a lifestyle,\" is the mantra of the modern developer, and whose lifestyle depends on the nature of the \"potential purchaser profile\". Some still get off on limed oak; others can't live without Smeg. </p> <p>\"The purchaser profile is very important,\" insists Dawn Kitchener of Connections In Design, a national company that rustles up show home interiors for all sorts of housing schemes. Her brief, in essence, is to \"create the desire to buy\", but first she needs to know exactly who the buyers are. That's not too difficult, I imagine. The defining factors must, surely, be location and spending power. But, no, Kitchener likes to \"visualise\" her purchaser. Whoever they are (\"go-ahead young professionals, city slickers, 30-plus high-earners\"), she sets out to second-guess those vital aspirations and merchandise accordingly. </p> <p>\"As a company, we are very aware of changing fashions and what turns people on,\" says Kitchener, who has just dressed a Nottingham flat in lilac and pewter. Home buyers, she continues, are better educated, more label-conscious, and have higher expectations these days. And one of the most significant new trends in home marketing, she observes, is in forging close relationships with big names in design, architecture and, indeed, fashion. </p> <p>John Rocha, for example, has put his name to design elements of L3, a just-launched city-centre scheme in Liverpool. Bruce Oldfield OBE, haute couturier to the rich and famous (Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jerry Hall, Jemima Khan and the late Princess Diana), has created four \"signature\" show homes at Kew Riverside, a salubrious housing development in Surrey. And super-designer Philippe Starck is a proactive partner in YOO, the developer behind YOOnw8, a loft-converted 30s telephone exchange in Maida Vale, London. </p> <p>So what, exactly, do you get in a Starck show home? Slinky chrome dining chairs, mink egg cosies, white cotton linen, Chanel No 19 gel moussant, a grinning gnome stool, glass candelabras, mountains of fresh citrus fruit, copies of Wallpaper*, no curtains. </p> <p>And what about the Oldfield? Walls clothed in panels of soft suede or navy pinstripe wool, daring colours, floor-sweeping white drapes in pleated silk (vaguely Issey Miyake), triple-milled soap bricks, potted cacti and copies of House &amp; Garden arranged on a low \"light-box\" table (his own design). </p> <p>According to Oldfield, doing show homes has proved a great way to launch \"a new career in cushion scattering\" (a testing ground, in other words, for his new range of furnishings and fabrics). For the developer St James Homes, it's the ultimate marketing coup. Kew Riverside (or QR, as it's known) is the kind of development that claims to offer \"a total solutions, bespoke concierge service\": the lowest-priced apartment is the one-bed (yours for \u00a3245,000). But QR is built on 26 acres of redundant Thames Water sewage works. A bit of kudos, a bit of \"full-on glamour\", was required. </p> <p>Oldfield doesn't have much truck with all that purchaser profile stuff. \"I dutifully listened to all the marketing gobbledegook and the earnest discussions about 'end-users',\" he says. \"But I still did exactly as I pleased.\" In essence, Oldfield acted as the creative director: he chose the colours and textiles; sourced classic images from the Hulton Getty photographic library; loaned original catwalk sketches. But the nuts and bolts or, as Oldfield puts it, \"the nick, nacky noos\" (the aspirational footwear, the reading material, the low-maintenance plant life, the Harvey Nichols wasabi and ginger dressing - all those little details that humanise a few hundred square feet of real estate) were the work of the ubiquitous Connections In Design. </p> <p>First impressions of the one-bed apartment, however, are pure Bruce Oldfield. A bedroom chair wears a ballgown of moir\u00e9 silk complete with bow-tied back; the bed, dressed in a quilted Puffa-style duvet, sits on a luminous pink light box that casts an ethereal mauve light over the pale blue carpet. \"There's a degree of 'what the hell' in show-home design,\" says Oldfield. \"It's a fantasy, a bit of theatre.\" </p> <p>To Dawn Kitchener's satisfaction, most potential purchasers who wandered in during the first few days were thirtysomething professionals, mostly women - exactly what she had visualised. Oldfield would have been equally delighted to meet the pair who fingered the silk chiffon curtains, and stroked the pink, poodley wool cushions and pronounced the decor \"very tactile\". St James Homes must be pleased, too. Kew Riverside's one beds have sold out. </p> <p>Show homes do work. Even developers who like to think that their purchasers are far too sophisticated for such trifles have to admit that all that styling makes a difference. John Hitchcox, the developer behind YOOnw8, is one of them. As an early pioneer of the London loft movement, he was a former member of the shell-and-core school, offering sandblasted building sites dressed, perhaps, with a single iconic chair. </p> <p>\"Looking back, it was arrogant to assume that buyers can visualise the potential of an empty space,\" he says. \"Most people tend to live in fairly normal environments, they don't know anything about design or construction - why should they? If you want to sell something extraordinary, you have to stimulate their imaginations.\" </p> <p>Together with Starck, Hitchcox has now come up with a formula for helping buyers \"define their own living environment\", a combination of personalised internal architecture and a choice of hundreds of fixtures and fittings, all divided into four lifestyle categories: Nature, Classic, Minimal and Culture. The show home (1,250sq ft at \u00a3600,000) is an example of the latter, and though it reflects Starck's idea of home (\"love, a fire, a good pillow and a good sunbeam in the morning at breakfast\"), it's not pure Starck (though he did handle the nick-nack shopping personally). </p> <p>The buyers Starck visualised are the kind that shop in Herm\u00e8s, wear cashmere sweaters and Italian slippers, eat organic (muesli and dozens of bottles of Biologica olive oil), read French; they cook, are possibly vegetarian (jars of black pasta, whole peanuts, dried chillies), they entertain and they are about to sit down to a weird simulated meal of teeny baby carrots, embryonic courgettes (slightly withered) and miniature red cabbages, all laid in artistic rows on square black plates with gold chopsticks. Their world is permeated by the ultimate artificial reality: views of leafy Maida Vale, represented by huge back-lit photographs in the windows, in a bid to hide the messy construction site that currently dominates the vista. </p> <p>Hitchcox remains resistant to the idea of selling a packaged lifestyle, but 70% of buyers went for the Culture option, presumably because that's what they saw. The Starck label has worked, too - Liam Gallagher and Nicole Appleton have been in twice. They are talking about buying a whole floor. </p> <p>There is nothing so glamorous about Redrow Homes' 51 02 development in central Bristol, targeted at young urban singles and childless couples. Former theatre designer Lulu Nikolai was hired to dress the two show apartments. It was a fairly tough assignment. The raw material - a 70s building that housed the offices of the now-defunct Avon County Council - was once voted the city's ugliest building. Though \u00a380,000 for a studio flat overlooking the four-lane junction of a major traffic island is not exactly cheap, Nikolai went for an effective low-budget look.</p> <p>Against a background of Pepper kitchen units, Smeg appliances and Italian lighting by Eglo and Artimede, she set out to create one \"chilled masculine\" environment and another in the homely feminine mode. \"The one-bedroom flat is based on the typical young bachelor, he might be gay, he might not, but he's a busy guy,\" she says. \"He's probably not in very often, but when he is, he wants to show off, he wants to look blokey and technically-minded. Colour is often a problem for a man, so I went for a monochrome palette with a splash of bold colour.\" </p> <p>The two-bedder, she continues, is based around \"a traditional professional couple - no children, busy lifestyle, but spend a bit more time at home\". There is a lilac bedroom, M&amp;S clothes, a whacky home-office with pictures of magazines (Stuff, Maxim, Elle Deco) printed on to a grey carpet and jeans-pocket pen holders on the wall. </p> <p>\"I've absolutely fallen in love with the two-bedroom flat,\" said one university student wandering around on the day of the public launch. \"If only I had \u00a3200,000.\" </p> <p>In the one-bedroom flat, a couple of chilled blokes are sprawled on Nikolai's leather banquette dreaming about an open-plan kitchen/ living space, furnished with Ikea, Habitat and a couple of stage-set tables made from sheets of clear glass supported on the legs and torsos of retired shop-window mannequins. Bedroom accessories include red lamps - with feet - red rubber drapes, fake fur, fragrances by Jean Paul Gaultier and Paco Rabanne. There's Brylcreem, Imperial Leather and Arouse Me massage oil in the bathroom. </p> <p>\"You've got to throw a little bit of humour into these things,\" says Nikolai. She pauses. \"I'll be brutally honest: it's all about sexuality. You've got bodies, you've got rubber, a bit of leather, lots of touchy-feely stuff. In both flats, I really wanted to highlight the bedroom side of things.\" </p> <p>Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen can't be far behind - Clothes Show/ Home Front presenter Jeff Banks has already created two \"stunning new house styles\" at Clements Park, a Crest development in Brentwood. What do you get in a Jeff Banks show home? Khaki and beige, walnut dining furniture, zebra and leopard prints, a bit of oriental theming. Not my cup of tea, but Banks's advice to buyers is worth noting: \"If you are looking for quality, look at the door hinges,\" he urges. </p> <p>And, yes, while you're at it, look at the building site. Every show home has one.</p>",

A bedroom chair wears a ballgown of moir\u00e9 silk complete with bow-tied back; the bed, dressed in a quilted Puffa-style duvet, sits on a luminous pink light box that casts an ethereal mauve light over the pale blue carpet. \"There's a degree of 'what the hell' in show-home design,\" says Oldfield. \"It's a fantasy, a bit of theatre.\" To Dawn Kitchener's satisfaction, most potential purchasers who wandered in during the first few days were thirtysomething professionals, mostly women - exactly what she had visualised. Oldfield would have been equally delighted to meet the pair who fingered the silk chiffon curtains, and stroked the pink, poodley wool cushions and pronounced the decor \"very tactile\". St James Homes must be pleased, too. Kew Riverside's one beds have sold out. Show homes do work. Even developers who like to think that their purchasers are far too sophisticated for such trifles have to admit that all that styling makes a difference. John Hitchcox, the developer behind YOOnw8, is one of them. As an early pioneer of the London loft movement, he was a former member of the shell-and-core school, offering sandblasted building sites dressed, perhaps, with a single iconic chair. \"Looking back, it was arrogant to assume that buyers can visualise the potential of an empty space,\" he says. \"Most people tend to live in fairly normal environments, they don't know anything about design or construction - why should they? If you want to sell something extraordinary, you have to stimulate their imaginations.\" Together with Starck, Hitchcox has now come up with a formula for helping buyers \"define their own living environment\", a combination of personalised internal architecture and a choice of hundreds of fixtures and fittings, all divided into four lifestyle categories: Nature, Classic, Minimal and Culture. The show home (1,250sq ft at \u00a3600,000) is an example of the latter, and though it reflects Starck's idea of home (\"love, a fire, a good pillow and a good sunbeam in the morning at breakfast\"), it's not pure Starck (though he did handle the nick-nack shopping personally). The buyers Starck visualised are the kind that shop in Herm\u00e8s, wear cashmere sweaters and Italian slippers, eat organic (muesli and dozens of bottles of Biologica olive oil), read French; they cook, are possibly vegetarian (jars of black pasta, whole peanuts, dried chillies), they entertain and they are about to sit down to a weird simulated meal of teeny baby carrots, embryonic courgettes (slightly withered) and miniature red cabbages, all laid in artistic rows on square black plates with gold chopsticks. Their world is permeated by the ultimate artificial reality: views of leafy Maida Vale, represented by huge back-lit photographs in the windows, in a bid to hide the messy construction site that currently dominates the vista. Hitchcox remains resistant to the idea of selling a packaged lifestyle, but 70% of buyers went for the Culture option, presumably because that's what they saw. The Starck label has worked, too - Liam Gallagher and Nicole Appleton have been in twice. They are talking about buying a whole floor. There is nothing so glamorous about Redrow Homes' 51 02 development in central Bristol, targeted at young urban singles and childless couples. Former theatre designer Lulu Nikolai was hired to dress the two show apartments. It was a fairly tough assignment. The raw material - a 70s building that housed the offices of the now-defunct Avon County Council - was once voted the city's ugliest building. Though \u00a380,000 for a studio flat overlooking the four-lane junction of a major traffic island is not exactly cheap, Nikolai went for an effective low-budget look. Against a background of Pepper kitchen units, Smeg appliances and Italian lighting by Eglo and Artimede, she set out to create one \"chilled masculine\" environment and another in the homely feminine mode. \"The one-bedroom flat is based on the typical young bachelor, he might be gay, he might not, but he's a busy guy,\" she says. \"He's probably not in very often, but when he is, he wants to show off, he wants to look blokey and technically-minded. Colour is often a problem for a man, so I went for a monochrome palette with a splash of bold colour.\" The two-bedder, she continues, is based around \"a traditional professional couple - no children, busy lifestyle, but spend a bit more time at home\". There is a lilac bedroom, M&amp;S clothes, a whacky home-office with pictures of magazines (Stuff, Maxim, Elle Deco) printed on to a grey carpet and jeans-pocket pen holders on the wall. \"I've absolutely fallen in love with the two-bedroom flat,\" said one university student wandering around on the day of the public launch. \"If only I had \u00a3200,000.\" In the one-bedroom flat, a couple of chilled blokes are sprawled on Nikolai's leather banquette dreaming about an open-plan kitchen/ living space, furnished with Ikea, Habitat and a couple of stage-set tables made from sheets of clear glass supported on the legs and torsos of retired shop-window mannequins. Bedroom accessories include red lamps - with feet - red rubber drapes, fake fur, fragrances by Jean Paul Gaultier and Paco Rabanne. There's Brylcreem, Imperial Leather and Arouse Me massage oil in the bathroom. \"You've got to throw a little bit of humour into these things,\" says Nikolai. She pauses. \"I'll be brutally honest: it's all about sexuality. You've got bodies, you've got rubber, a bit of leather, lots of touchy-feely stuff. In both flats, I really wanted to highlight the bedroom side of things.\" Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen can't be far behind - Clothes Show/ Home Front presenter Jeff Banks has already created two \"stunning new house styles\" at Clements Park, a Crest development in Brentwood. What do you get in a Jeff Banks show home? Khaki and beige, walnut dining furniture, zebra and leopard prints, a bit of oriental theming. Not my cup of tea, but Banks's advice to buyers is worth noting: \"If you are looking for quality, look at the door hinges,\" he urges. And, yes, while you're at it, look at the building site. Every show home has one.",

      "body": "<p>Love is in the air. It's in the crimson soft furnishings, in the pendulous chandeliers, in the Diet Coke my charming companion is sipping, in every sweet, unaffected sentence she utters. Nana simply can't stop talking about the power of love. \"Love is for me everything. We need to feel that we are loved, we are appreciated. Love is to be appreciated,\" she says, her perfectly glossed lips separating around the straw.</p> <p>We may be sitting in a Parisian hotel lobby, but we're in a land where the only language is lines from my 64-year-old companion's slushy, over-sentimental songs. Our conversation contains no meaning beyond them: \"I realised that if I was singing, there was love for me, people liked me. And it's so important to feel that you are loved. And in order to be loved, you have to deserve it.\"</p> <p>The world's best-selling female singer is addicted to obvious affection. She craves it, feeds on it, and ladles it out by the lyric load. Our meeting began with me cynically counting the number of times the bespectacled woman sitting opposite uttered the word \"love\". I counted 23. \"A record for an interview?\" I jotted down in my notebook. A further 10 minutes, and there had been 15 more. But sentimentality is seductive, and within half an hour my own sentences were littered with soft, shallow mutterings, and I, too, sounded like a stuck record. Something had gotten hold of my heart. Before long, I found myself half-humming, half-asking, \"What is love about?\"</p> <p>This was not how I had intended our encounter to begin. I had been determined to go in hard. \"Why do you always part your hair down the middle?\" and \"Is that plain glass in your spectacles?\" were the two questions I had lined up to fire first. Destroy the woman's accoutrements, I thought, and she'd be stripped bare. There's nothing more to Nana Mouskouri than a distinctive hairdo and some outdated face furniture.</p> <p>But, oh, how deceived I had been. Nana Mouskouri has sold more than 200 million records, receiving over 300 gold, platinum and diamond discs. Adaptation rather than innovation is her style, transforming even the most demanding lyric into easy listening. Her songs are nearly always written for others and then executed, often more successfully, by Nana. There are no frontiers in her musical world. She's attempted The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Kris Kristofferson, James Taylor, Dolly Parton, Cat Stevens, Bob Dylan, Bette Midler, Charles Aznavour, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Neil Young, Georges Bizet, Neil Sedaka, Franz Schubert, Judy Garland, Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Carole King and Don Maclean.</p> <p>She's recorded more than 1,350 songs, in German, English, French, Spanish, Greek, Portuguese, Japanese, Dutch, Hebrew, Italian and Corsican. It's often not possible to tell in which language she's singing - as if it mattered. She always sings in Nana-speak. Her singing always sounds so effortless. It demands only to be listened to; her apparent ease puts us at ease. It reminds us, perhaps, of being sung to sleep as children; it is comforting, lulling, never threatening. She doesn't belt but oozes out the tune, as if there were nothing more natural than singing before thousands. She isn't showy on stage; it is her quietness that holds us, the suggestion that each of us is alone with her.</p> <p>She appeals to the most simple and basic emotion in everyone, anywhere. She is passion without the merest soup\u00e7on of smut. She is the ambassador of untainted, asexual love, and every continent embraces her universal message. She's vast in Venezuela and big in Korea. When a concert in Christchurch, New Zealand, was transmitted on the radio, a telegram arrived from a base at the South Pole. \"Dear Nana, We're so sorry not be at the concert tonight, but we still are so happy that you are only a three-hour flight away from us.\" Only in Britain does the whiff of cynicism linger over her. Only here is she seen as a joke.</p> <p>Joanna \"Nana\" Mouskouri started looking for love at a young age. She was born in Crete on October 13, 1936, the daughter of a cinema projectionist. Two years later, they moved to Athens and lived in a house behind the open-air cinema where her father worked. It was the eve of world war. \"I remember the bombs and the horror, the people I saw dead from hunger in the street. When you see things like that, you never forget. The first thing I asked my father was why people die. He said because people don't like each other, they hate each other, and that's when they make war. I thought there was no love. So I started to search for love since I was a little girl. I used to say there must be some love alive inside of me.\"</p> <p>Already, she was composing the soundtrack of her future career. Her mother, a thwarted singer, enrolled her two daughters at the Hellenic Conservatoire in Athens, where Nana remained for nine years. Seduced by the city's nightclubs, where she began to work, she was asked to leave the classical conservatory. Success came seemingly without effort, winning every competition that she entered, from the first Greek Song Festival to the 1960 Mediterranean Festival in Barcelona. In 1961, she had her first gold record with White Rose Of Athens, selling more than one and a half million copies in Germany alone. She was only 25, and the four-lettered word - love - was already her hallmark. \"I had so many complexes when I was younger. I thought I wasn't worth anything. The only thing I realised - when I was singing, is that people would smile to me, would like me. So it became somehow my security, singing. Singing made me come out of all my complexes, trust the world, trust that there is love.\"</p> <p>Her life and her lyrics became indistinguishable. A year later, she was in New York with Quincy Jones recording the classic jazz album, A Girl From Greece Sings. Two years later, she represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision song contest. If love was her slogan, versatility was her strength. The night of the contest, Harry Belafonte happened to be in town and watched Nana's performance on TV. He remembered once seeing the young Greek singer in an Athens nightclub, asked to be introduced and invited her to audition in New York. From 1964 to 1966, they toured North America together. \"He was the artist who influenced me most, encouraged me to be myself no matter what happens. Harry taught me how to choose my songs in order to give my personal message,\" she says.</p> <p>In 1969, her first record for the English market, Over And Over, was released. It stayed in the charts for more than 100 weeks. Her first concert at London's Albert Hall sold out in hours. The BBC launched a television series, Nana With Guests. At last, Britain, too, was in love with her.</p> <p>France had already fallen. And characteristically, she thanked them for it by adopting it as her homeland. Now living in Paris and Geneva, she takes me to the Olympia theatre and we sit in the empty late-afternoon seats, staring at the empty stage, reminiscing, Nana-style. \"I remember the first time when I came here in the 60s and I saw Edith Piaf. I couldn't understand one word of what she was singing. But I was so moved, so moved. I was crying. I was so impressed, this little woman singing on that stage. When I went out, my friend took me across the street and I looked at the lights and the name of Edith Piaf. My friend said, 'Well, you look at this name now. One day your name will be written there.' I said, 'No, no. It will be far from possible.' I didn't dare say that I am able to go on that stage where that wonderful woman was. For me it was a sacred stage. It was a place I never thought I would be able to sing myself.\"</p> <p>But, of course, she did. Shortly afterwards, in 1969, she was asked to replace Gilbert Becaud for a three-week run. She was three months pregnant with her first child, Nicholas. \"We had only Monday off, and on Sunday we had two concerts. I sang Farewell Angelina, Ton Amour, Little Drummer Boy... It was a big break for me. Artistically, I was born at the Olympia.\"</p> <p>Nana is modest, but not self-deprecating. She knows her biggest help has been herself. \"The door was opened for me, and I recognised it was a good door. This is one thing to my credit. The ancient Greeks, they used to say that Lady Luck is a very beautiful girl with magnificent curly hair and she walks among other people in the street. One should recognise her and grab her from the hair, out front, because behind she is bald. When I was asked to play here, reasonably I should have said 'No', because I was pregnant. But then I said, 'I have nothing to lose'. I should try it. And I didn't lose.\"</p> <p>But to conquer the world, love is not enough. \"Discipline,\" says Nana, in an accent that makes it sound like a dirty word, the only one in her multilingual vocabulary. \"It's important to live in discipline.\" Twenty days after giving birth to her second child, Helen, who now sings with her, she went back to work. Every day since, she has lain on her back, placed a box on her diaphragm, and done breathing exercises, watching the box move up and down. Then she tucks her toes under a bar and does sit-ups. For 40 years, she has been singing two hours each morning. If she has a concert in the evening, she sings for two hours in the afternoon as well.</p> <p>\"In the bath?\" I joke, and for the first time she looks at me with disapproval.</p> <p>\"Music for me was never a pastime,\" she says. \"I don't sing in my bathroom, not at all. It is a serious thing. I have a studio in Geneva, and here in Paris I have a small room in my apartment. I'm there by myself with a small piano. I want to be concentrated in it, that is very important. You can never achieve something if you don't take it seriously.\"</p> <p>She has little sympathy for shirkers. \"You have to choose a certain way in your life. When I was young, all the other girls smoked. But I realised that if I wanted to be a singer, it wasn't healthy. If I have to work the next day, I have to go to sleep early.\"</p> <p>Lack of civic discipline is why she now finds Athens impossible for any more than brief visits, although she remains patriotic to her birthplace, having represented Greece in the European Parliament and campaigned for the return of the Parthenon Marbles.</p> <p>\"Discipline,\" she mutters.</p> <p>After two days together, I begin to take risks. I decide it's time to make a request I haven't dared earlier, for fear of causing offence. She famously refused one journalist with a shriek of, \"Oh, no, I feel naked without them!\"</p> <p>\"Could you possibly take off your glasses?\" I ask, ready to receive her rare wrath.</p> <p>\"Yes, of course,\" she replies immediately. Without the black frames, she looks even younger, and wonderfully girlish. \"I cannot see beyond two to three metres,\" she says, waving her black rims around. \"I thought I was ugly as I was, and with glasses I was even worse. The doctor told me, 'If you wear your glasses, your poor sight will not get worse. But if you don't wear them, it will be worse.' I just started regularly to wear them, although I hated them.\" She was nine years old. \"This is discipline,\" she explains.</p> <p>Little did the doctor know that those frames would become the most famous pair of spectacles in the world. We can all draw a picture of them by heart. \"When I became very popular, they said, 'Now you can't go around like this with those glasses, being like you are. You have to become blonde, be fashionable.' And I said, 'No, if the people like me like this, maybe they will go on liking me like this. There is no reason why should I change.' And I wanted to be honest with myself and stay as I was. I stayed like this.\"</p> <p>Her hair never grows, her gold hoop earrings never tarnish. I tentatively suggest that most women, by the time they reach their 60s, have experimented with a number of different styles, or at least different haircuts. \"Not me,\" pipes up Nana. \"I spent my time until 25 or so trying to change. I tried to cut my hair, long hair, braids, everything. And then one day I realised my hair was like this. And then I didn't want to change. It was not an image, but it became an image. Of course, today I have to put colour shampoo in my hair because it is white.\"</p> <p>Artifice, like sex appeal, appears to pass this lady by. Perhaps that is why a myopic Greek girl became the most successful, enduring female solo artist in the world? Nana thinks so. \"Because I was very honest and sincere about what I was doing. And maybe because it was so simple, not at all complicated. Others are prima donnas or artistes that people idolise, but they don't touch them. Me, I was a person that they could touch. I remember when I was pregnant with my son, everybody would write to me letters - I have problem with my children, I have problem with my husband. I was like a family, and I still am. I am part of them, of the people, in many countries.\"</p> <p>We often judge others by their friends. Nana Mouskouri should be judged by her fans. Her importance to them cannot be underestimated. Their devotion is not subject to the whims of fashion. They are not fickle. They do not desert her. They stand by her for years, from puberty to approaching their pensions. And, despite what you may presume, they are not all blue-rinsed ladies. She has a huge young gay male following. (One joke goes, \"How do you come out to your parents? Show them your Nana Mouskouri collection.\") Her fans don't care if the rest of us snigger. They are self-aware enough to dub themselves Nana-raks or Mousketeers. Please do remember, Nana rose to fame before stars became suspicious of their following. It was before Pink Floyd built The Wall to keep them from their adoring supporters, the same people who bought their records and made them millions. Before Posh and Becks had Chester Zoo closed to the public so they could take around baby Brooklyn unpestered. Before Madonna spent just 30 minutes on stage at her latest Brixton concert, calculating that would be enough to satisfy the adoring throng.</p> <p>Nana has always liked her fans. She feels indebted to them. \"What I needed all my life is to be loved. I sing my songs and I get this love I need to have. That's what I get back.\" She's never had a bodyguard. We walked along a Paris street together, her with that hair and those glasses, and people stopped to shake her hand. She said she likes being recognised. She never spends less than two and a half hours on stage; she says she feels she owes it to those who have come to give them a good evening. She is fond of her fans, and wears a brooch given to her by a Danish fan - a ruby encrusted red ribbon.</p> <p>It's not surprising, therefore, that her songs sell so well. People rarely buy one or two Nana CDs; they buy all of them, every record, every re-release. They are loyal to her because she is loyal to them. In a tumultuous industry, she's remained with the same record company throughout her career. \"They worked with me to make it. Why should I leave now that I've made it?\" she asks.</p> <p>David has every one of her albums, more than 800 of them. He's a sensible, highly successful 43-year-old director who lives in Brighton. He is also a proud Mousketeer. I introduced David and Nana over lunch in, at Nana's suggestion, Caf\u00e9 de Flore on Boulevard St Germain, where de Beauvoir and Sartre used to hang out. I was nervous about the meeting. Stars are often snooty towards their fans. But within a few precious moments, Nana and David were huddled up in the booth. Listening in to their conversation was like intruding on long lost lovers. There were continual declarations of affection for each other. \"I was 16 and having some trouble in my life, and then I switched on the television and you were singing. I thought - this woman understands,\" starts David. The song was I Dreamed You. (I start humming...)</p> <p>\"I set out to sing searching for love with a big, big love. Then somebody listens and needs the same thing,\" says Nana.</p> <p>\"You've never let me down. You have been the soundtrack of my life. There's not a day I don't play your music,\" says David, taking a break to order Croque Madame. Nana, like a dutiful lover, orders the same.</p> <p>\"There's so much love in your work,\" says David. She grasps his arm: \"Oh, you make me cry.\" The Croque Madame arrives. It may be just fried egg and cheese on toast, but Nana declares it delicious, the perfect choice. \"I sing for one person. I do not sing for everybody. But then everybody is one,\" she says.</p> <p>\"We all think it's our Nana. Everybody,\" responds David.</p> <p>\"I don't sing complicated things. Just simple things,\" says Nana. \"But they are the most essential.\" Then, still close, they laugh, remembering Benny Hill's imitation of her, as if sharing an intimate memory. They remember when she was on Morecambe &amp; Wise, Dame Edna... David remembers his first Nana concert, in Eastbourne in 1976. \"Eastbourne!\" he says, and they laugh again.</p> <p>Andre Chapelle enters the restaurant. Andre has been with Nana for more than 20 years, first as her sound engineer, then as her partner after the break-up of her marriage to Greek guitarist George Petsilas. One day, she says, they may get married, they always mean to. Andre is Nana's underbelly. While she dresses conservatively, classically, with a smudge of bright red lipstick, Andre is a dandy who seems to have clothed himself from a child's dressing-up box. He's wearing a peach-coloured, box-shaped jacket, which even Oxfam would have a problem putting a price on. While Nana's decorations are tastefully understated, Andre sports (rather than wears) an emerald flowered tie, gold watch and gold link bracelet. He carries his wallet around in something rather like a mock Victorian frilly washbag, strung from his wrist. Nor do they seem to share a hairdresser. From under his 10-gallon hat sprouts a mane of long, grey, fine frizzy hair. I keep thinking he reminds me of someone, and then I remember who: Wurzel Gummidge. Partly because of his looks and partly because, like Wurzel, he seems to have wandered out of another decade without realising that he's done so. Andre is dated, while Nana remains dateless.</p> <p>I ask Andre his age. He refuses to tell me. Nana is obviously irritated; she has no such inhibitions. After all, she has already mentioned that her hallmark black hair is dyed. But Andre is not so open with the press. \"Elle est journaliste ,\" he spits.</p> <p>\"Tell her,\" Nana snaps back at Wurzel. \"Once you've told her, it's done.\" He pretends he hasn't heard her. They hiss at each other at intervals throughout the meal. Nana's publicity woman whispers in my ear, \"They'll be having an argument about that all the way home.\" Ah, love is a rocky road. Later, when we're alone, Nana tells me, \"Andre is 60.\"</p> <p>Why have we forsaken this honest, lovely lady? Where did our love go? For almost 20 years, since Nana With Guests folded in 1981, she has been lost in an emotional wilderness. While she continued to tour and soar throughout the rest of the world, Britain hardened its heart. That hairdo! Those glasses! The only people who were proud of her image were female impersonators.</p> <p>But that was the 80s, when we were all material girls and boys. Perhaps the tide of emotion has changed. Perhaps we are ready, once again, for Nana Mouskouri. Perhaps it is time to cast out cynicism. Perhaps we will, after all, get back that loving feeling. We just have to hum it, and she'll surely sing it.</p> <p>As we parted, sitting close in the back of her chauffeur-driven car, Nana, her helmet of hair intact, leant over and said, full of meaning, \"Thank you so much for introducing me to David. It was really, really...\" She is looking for words. \"Lovely.\"</p> <p>A few days later, I received a note from David. \"Thank you so much for introducing me to Nana. Now I know it's true - dreams can come true.\" That's love for you.</p> <p>\u0095 At Her Very Best, a CD anthology of Nana Mouskouri's greatest tracks, is out this week. Her first UK tour in 12 years starts in April.</p>",

It's often not possible to tell in which language she's singing - as if it mattered. She always sings in Nana-speak. Her singing always sounds so effortless. It demands only to be listened to; her apparent ease puts us at ease. It reminds us, perhaps, of being sung to sleep as children; it is comforting, lulling, never threatening. She doesn't belt but oozes out the tune, as if there were nothing more natural than singing before thousands. She isn't showy on stage; it is her quietness that holds us, the suggestion that each of us is alone with her. She appeals to the most simple and basic emotion in everyone, anywhere. She is passion without the merest soup\u00e7on of smut. She is the ambassador of untainted, asexual love, and every continent embraces her universal message. She's vast in Venezuela and big in Korea. When a concert in Christchurch, New Zealand, was transmitted on the radio, a telegram arrived from a base at the South Pole. \"Dear Nana, We're so sorry not be at the concert tonight, but we still are so happy that you are only a three-hour flight away from us.\" Only in Britain does the whiff of cynicism linger over her. Only here is she seen as a joke. Joanna \"Nana\" Mouskouri started looking for love at a young age. She was born in Crete on October 13, 1936, the daughter of a cinema projectionist. Two years later, they moved to Athens and lived in a house behind the open-air cinema where her father worked. It was the eve of world war. \"I remember the bombs and the horror, the people I saw dead from hunger in the street. When you see things like that, you never forget. The first thing I asked my father was why people die. He said because people don't like each other, they hate each other, and that's when they make war. I thought there was no love. So I started to search for love since I was a little girl. I used to say there must be some love alive inside of me.\" Already, she was composing the soundtrack of her future career. Her mother, a thwarted singer, enrolled her two daughters at the Hellenic Conservatoire in Athens, where Nana remained for nine years. Seduced by the city's nightclubs, where she began to work, she was asked to leave the classical conservatory. Success came seemingly without effort, winning every competition that she entered, from the first Greek Song Festival to the 1960 Mediterranean Festival in Barcelona. In 1961, she had her first gold record with White Rose Of Athens, selling more than one and a half million copies in Germany alone. She was only 25, and the four-lettered word - love - was already her hallmark. \"I had so many complexes when I was younger. I thought I wasn't worth anything. The only thing I realised - when I was singing, is that people would smile to me, would like me. So it became somehow my security, singing. Singing made me come out of all my complexes, trust the world, trust that there is love.\" Her life and her lyrics became indistinguishable. A year later, she was in New York with Quincy Jones recording the classic jazz album, A Girl From Greece Sings. Two years later, she represented Luxembourg in the Eurovision song contest. If love was her slogan, versatility was her strength. The night of the contest, Harry Belafonte happened to be in town and watched Nana's performance on TV. He remembered once seeing the young Greek singer in an Athens nightclub, asked to be introduced and invited her to audition in New York. From 1964 to 1966, they toured North America together. \"He was the artist who influenced me most, encouraged me to be myself no matter what happens. Harry taught me how to choose my songs in order to give my personal message,\" she says. In 1969, her first record for the English market, Over And Over, was released. It stayed in the charts for more than 100 weeks. Her first concert at London's Albert Hall sold out in hours. The BBC launched a television series, Nana With Guests. At last, Britain, too, was in love with her. France had already fallen. And characteristically, she thanked them for it by adopting it as her homeland. Now living in Paris and Geneva, she takes me to the Olympia theatre and we sit in the empty late-afternoon seats, staring at the empty stage, reminiscing, Nana-style. \"I remember the first time when I came here in the 60s and I saw Edith Piaf. I couldn't understand one word of what she was singing. But I was so moved, so moved. I was crying. I was so impressed, this little woman singing on that stage. When I went out, my friend took me across the street and I looked at the lights and the name of Edith Piaf. My friend said, 'Well, you look at this name now. One day your name will be written there.' I said, 'No, no. It will be far from possible.' I didn't dare say that I am able to go on that stage where that wonderful woman was. For me it was a sacred stage. It was a place I never thought I would be able to sing myself.\" But, of course, she did. Shortly afterwards, in 1969, she was asked to replace Gilbert Becaud for a three-week run. She was three months pregnant with her first child, Nicholas. \"We had only Monday off, and on Sunday we had two concerts. I sang Farewell Angelina, Ton Amour, Little Drummer Boy... It was a big break for me. Artistically, I was born at the Olympia.\" Nana is modest, but not self-deprecating. She knows her biggest help has been herself. \"The door was opened for me, and I recognised it was a good door. This is one thing to my credit. The ancient Greeks, they used to say that Lady Luck is a very beautiful girl with magnificent curly hair and she walks among other people in the street. One should recognise her and grab her from the hair, out front, because behind she is bald. When I was asked to play here, reasonably I should have said 'No', because I was pregnant. But then I said, 'I have nothing to lose'. I should try it. And I didn't lose.\" But to conquer the world, love is not enough. \"Discipline,\" says Nana, in an accent that makes it sound like a dirty word, the only one in her multilingual vocabulary. \"It's important to live in discipline.\" Twenty days after giving birth to her second child, Helen, who now sings with her, she went back to work. Every day since, she has lain on her back, placed a box on her diaphragm, and done breathing exercises, watching the box move up and down. Then she tucks her toes under a bar and does sit-ups. For 40 years, she has been singing two hours each morning. If she has a concert in the evening, she sings for two hours in the afternoon as well. \"In the bath?\" I joke, and for the first time she looks at me with disapproval. \"Music for me was never a pastime,\" she says. \"I don't sing in my bathroom, not at all. It is a serious thing. I have a studio in Geneva, and here in Paris I have a small room in my apartment. I'm there by myself with a small piano. I want to be concentrated in it, that is very important. You can never achieve something if you don't take it seriously.\" She has little sympathy for shirkers. \"You have to choose a certain way in your life. When I was young, all the other girls smoked. But I realised that if I wanted to be a singer, it wasn't healthy. If I have to work the next day, I have to go to sleep early.\" Lack of civic discipline is why she now finds Athens impossible for any more than brief visits, although she remains patriotic to her birthplace, having represented Greece in the European Parliament and campaigned for the return of the Parthenon Marbles. \"Discipline,\" she mutters. After two days together, I begin to take risks. I decide it's time to make a request I haven't dared earlier, for fear of causing offence. She famously refused one journalist with a shriek of, \"Oh, no, I feel naked without them!\" \"Could you possibly take off your glasses?\" I ask, ready to receive her rare wrath. \"Yes, of course,\" she replies immediately. Without the black frames, she looks even younger, and wonderfully girlish. \"I cannot see beyond two to three metres,\" she says, waving her black rims around. \"I thought I was ugly as I was, and with glasses I was even worse. The doctor told me, 'If you wear your glasses, your poor sight will not get worse. But if you don't wear them, it will be worse.' I just started regularly to wear them, although I hated them.\" She was nine years old. \"This is discipline,\" she explains. Little did the doctor know that those frames would become the most famous pair of spectacles in the world. We can all draw a picture of them by heart. \"When I became very popular, they said, 'Now you can't go around like this with those glasses, being like you are. You have to become blonde, be fashionable.' And I said, 'No, if the people like me like this, maybe they will go on liking me like this. There is no reason why should I change.' And I wanted to be honest with myself and stay as I was. I stayed like this.\" Her hair never grows, her gold hoop earrings never tarnish. I tentatively suggest that most women, by the time they reach their 60s, have experimented with a number of different styles, or at least different haircuts. \"Not me,\" pipes up Nana. \"I spent my time until 25 or so trying to change. I tried to cut my hair, long hair, braids, everything. And then one day I realised my hair was like this. And then I didn't want to change. It was not an image, but it became an image. Of course, today I have to put colour shampoo in my hair because it is white.\" Artifice, like sex appeal, appears to pass this lady by. Perhaps that is why a myopic Greek girl became the most successful, enduring female solo artist in the world? Nana thinks so. \"Because I was very honest and sincere about what I was doing. And maybe because it was so simple, not at all complicated. Others are prima donnas or artistes that people idolise, but they don't touch them. Me, I was a person that they could touch. I remember when I was pregnant with my son, everybody would write to me letters - I have problem with my children, I have problem with my husband. I was like a family, and I still am. I am part of them, of the people, in many countries.\" We often judge others by their friends. Nana Mouskouri should be judged by her fans. Her importance to them cannot be underestimated. Their devotion is not subject to the whims of fashion. They are not fickle. They do not desert her. They stand by her for years, from puberty to approaching their pensions. And, despite what you may presume, they are not all blue-rinsed ladies. She has a huge young gay male following. (One joke goes, \"How do you come out to your parents? Show them your Nana Mouskouri collection.\") Her fans don't care if the rest of us snigger. They are self-aware enough to dub themselves Nana-raks or Mousketeers. Please do remember, Nana rose to fame before stars became suspicious of their following. It was before Pink Floyd built The Wall to keep them from their adoring supporters, the same people who bought their records and made them millions. Before Posh and Becks had Chester Zoo closed to the public so they could take around baby Brooklyn unpestered. Before Madonna spent just 30 minutes on stage at her latest Brixton concert, calculating that would be enough to satisfy the adoring throng. Nana has always liked her fans. She feels indebted to them. \"What I needed all my life is to be loved. I sing my songs and I get this love I need to have. That's what I get back.\" She's never had a bodyguard. We walked along a Paris street together, her with that hair and those glasses, and people stopped to shake her hand. She said she likes being recognised. She never spends less than two and a half hours on stage; she says she feels she owes it to those who have come to give them a good evening. She is fond of her fans, and wears a brooch given to her by a Danish fan - a ruby encrusted red ribbon. It's not surprising, therefore, that her songs sell so well. People rarely buy one or two Nana CDs; they buy all of them, every record, every re-release. They are loyal to her because she is loyal to them. In a tumultuous industry, she's remained with the same record company throughout her career. \"They worked with me to make it. Why should I leave now that I've made it?\" she asks. David has every one of her albums, more than 800 of them. He's a sensible, highly successful 43-year-old director who lives in Brighton. He is also a proud Mousketeer. I introduced David and Nana over lunch in, at Nana's suggestion, Caf\u00e9 de Flore on Boulevard St Germain, where de Beauvoir and Sartre used to hang out. I was nervous about the meeting. Stars are often snooty towards their fans. But within a few precious moments, Nana and David were huddled up in the booth. Listening in to their conversation was like intruding on long lost lovers. There were continual declarations of affection for each other. \"I was 16 and having some trouble in my life, and then I switched on the television and you were singing. I thought - this woman understands,\" starts David. The song was I Dreamed You. (I start humming...) \"I set out to sing searching for love with a big, big love. Then somebody listens and needs the same thing,\" says Nana. \"You've never let me down. You have been the soundtrack of my life. There's not a day I don't play your music,\" says David, taking a break to order Croque Madame. Nana, like a dutiful lover, orders the same. \"There's so much love in your work,\" says David. She grasps his arm: \"Oh, you make me cry.\" The Croque Madame arrives. It may be just fried egg and cheese on toast, but Nana declares it delicious, the perfect choice. \"I sing for one person. I do not sing for everybody. But then everybody is one,\" she says. \"We all think it's our Nana. Everybody,\" responds David. \"I don't sing complicated things. Just simple things,\" says Nana. \"But they are the most essential.\" Then, still close, they laugh, remembering Benny Hill's imitation of her, as if sharing an intimate memory. They remember when she was on Morecambe &amp; Wise, Dame Edna... David remembers his first Nana concert, in Eastbourne in 1976. \"Eastbourne!\" he says, and they laugh again. Andre Chapelle enters the restaurant. Andre has been with Nana for more than 20 years, first as her sound engineer, then as her partner after the break-up of her marriage to Greek guitarist George Petsilas. One day, she says, they may get married, they always mean to. Andre is Nana's underbelly. While she dresses conservatively, classically, with a smudge of bright red lipstick, Andre is a dandy who seems to have clothed himself from a child's dressing-up box. He's wearing a peach-coloured, box-shaped jacket, which even Oxfam would have a problem putting a price on. While Nana's decorations are tastefully understated, Andre sports (rather than wears) an emerald flowered tie, gold watch and gold link bracelet. He carries his wallet around in something rather like a mock Victorian frilly washbag, strung from his wrist. Nor do they seem to share a hairdresser. From under his 10-gallon hat sprouts a mane of long, grey, fine frizzy hair. I keep thinking he reminds me of someone, and then I remember who: Wurzel Gummidge. Partly because of his looks and partly because, like Wurzel, he seems to have wandered out of another decade without realising that he's done so. Andre is dated, while Nana remains dateless. I ask Andre his age. He refuses to tell me. Nana is obviously irritated; she has no such inhibitions. After all, she has already mentioned that her hallmark black hair is dyed. But Andre is not so open with the press. \"Elle est journaliste ,\" he spits. \"Tell her,\" Nana snaps back at Wurzel. \"Once you've told her, it's done.\" He pretends he hasn't heard her. They hiss at each other at intervals throughout the meal. Nana's publicity woman whispers in my ear, \"They'll be having an argument about that all the way home.\" Ah, love is a rocky road. Later, when we're alone, Nana tells me, \"Andre is 60.\" Why have we forsaken this honest, lovely lady? Where did our love go? For almost 20 years, since Nana With Guests folded in 1981, she has been lost in an emotional wilderness. While she continued to tour and soar throughout the rest of the world, Britain hardened its heart. That hairdo! Those glasses! The only people who were proud of her image were female impersonators. But that was the 80s, when we were all material girls and boys. Perhaps the tide of emotion has changed. Perhaps we are ready, once again, for Nana Mouskouri. Perhaps it is time to cast out cynicism. Perhaps we will, after all, get back that loving feeling. We just have to hum it, and she'll surely sing it. As we parted, sitting close in the back of her chauffeur-driven car, Nana, her helmet of hair intact, leant over and said, full of meaning, \"Thank you so much for introducing me to David. It was really, really...\" She is looking for words. \"Lovely.\" A few days later, I received a note from David. \"Thank you so much for introducing me to Nana. Now I know it's true - dreams can come true.\" That's love for you. \u0095 At Her Very Best, a CD anthology of Nana Mouskouri's greatest tracks, is out this week. Her first UK tour in 12 years starts in April.",

      "body": "<p>If it wasn't for the internet, finding a good interest rate for your cash would be a tough call following the recent rate cut by the Bank of England. But there is now so much competition between banks to make their mark in the virtual world that there are some market-beating rates available. </p> <p>Not all of these rates appear in savings best-buy tables because they are being offered as rates on credit balances in current accounts. Even so, the league table of savings rates for no-notice accounts are dominated by web accounts. </p> <p>Six out of the top 10 no-notice savings accounts in the best buy table from Moneyfacts are web accounts. The e-banks are offering market-beating rates in order to ensure enough people sign up for their products and they reach critical mass. For some providers, like Egg, which tops the Moneyfacts table, it will start to become profitable when it has sold several products to customers with a savings account. </p> <p>Egg holds number one position in the Moneyfacts league for its Investor account, which is only open to customers who invest in the Egg Isa (Individual savings account). This makes it unsuitable for people who want to use all their Isa allowance to invest in stocks and shares. It pays 7% on balances of \u00a31 and above. </p> <p>Nationwide building society, which this week prompted a mortgage war by cutting its variable rate for existing as well as new borrowers, has an e-Savings account which pays 6.70% for balances over \u00a31. Close behind is Halifax's Web Saver at 6.35%, Intelligent Finance's Direct Access paying 6% and Egg's Internet Only, also paying 6%. </p> <p>You can, however, earn up to 7% on credit balances if you open a current account with Cahoot, the new e-bank from the Abbey National. It doesn't appear in the Moneyfacts savings table, however, because it is a current, rather than a traditional savings account. </p> <p>Some of the high headline rates available from the new internet banks are likely to be loss-leaders and won't be available for ever. First-e, for example, used to pay one of the best interest rates on the market for savings account, at 6% gross, but it has introduced three bands of interest rate and has just dropped the rate to 4.5% gross for balances under \u00a35,000. For balances of \u00a3100,000 or more, the rate is 5.5% gross. Its current account is paying 4.75% gross (down from 4.88% gross before the last interest rate cut). </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.first-e.com\">First-e</a> does not offer an overdraft facility or cheque guarantee card. It does offer a savings account, but you are encouraged to use both accounts as pure internet accounts and you may be charged for making telephone calls. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.smile.co.uk\">Smile</a> from the Co-operative Bank, pays a top rate of 6% gross on its savings account but to qualify for this you have to have a current account into which you pay your monthly salary or \u00a31,000 a month. In fact, Smile once again topped the league of internet banks in a league table compiled by Gomez, the internet quality measurement firm. </p> <p>The Smile current account pays 4.85% gross AER (compounded interest rate) on interest on credit balances and has an interest-free overdraft facility up to \u00a3500. </p> <p>The savings account pays a better rate of interest if you already have a current account for balances over \u00a31 or more. The basic rate is 5% gross AER but you could earn an extra 1% gross on your savings by opening both a current account and a savings account. </p> <p>Nevertheless, canny investors who were planning to switch their current accounts and who get in quickly can enjoy high rates on credit balances. Gomez has drawn up an Internet Banker Scorecard for current accounts from online banks according to ease of use, customer service, product lines and overall cost.

      "bodyText": "If it wasn't for the internet, finding a good interest rate for your cash would be a tough call following the recent rate cut by the Bank of England. But there is now so much competition between banks to make their mark in the virtual world that there are some market-beating rates available. Not all of these rates appear in savings best-buy tables because they are being offered as rates on credit balances in current accounts. Even so, the league table of savings rates for no-notice accounts are dominated by web accounts. Six out of the top 10 no-notice savings accounts in the best buy table from Moneyfacts are web accounts. The e-banks are offering market-beating rates in order to ensure enough people sign up for their products and they reach critical mass. For some providers, like Egg, which tops the Moneyfacts table, it will start to become profitable when it has sold several products to customers with a savings account. Egg holds number one position in the Moneyfacts league for its Investor account, which is only open to customers who invest in the Egg Isa (Individual savings account). This makes it unsuitable for people who want to use all their Isa allowance to invest in stocks and shares. It pays 7% on balances of \u00a31 and above. Nationwide building society, which this week prompted a mortgage war by cutting its variable rate for existing as well as new borrowers, has an e-Savings account which pays 6.70% for balances over \u00a31. Close behind is Halifax's Web Saver at 6.35%, Intelligent Finance's Direct Access paying 6% and Egg's Internet Only, also paying 6%. You can, however, earn up to 7% on credit balances if you open a current account with Cahoot, the new e-bank from the Abbey National. It doesn't appear in the Moneyfacts savings table, however, because it is a current, rather than a traditional savings account. Some of the high headline rates available from the new internet banks are likely to be loss-leaders and won't be available for ever. First-e, for example, used to pay one of the best interest rates on the market for savings account, at 6% gross, but it has introduced three bands of interest rate and has just dropped the rate to 4.5% gross for balances under \u00a35,000. For balances of \u00a3100,000 or more, the rate is 5.5% gross. Its current account is paying 4.75% gross (down from 4.88% gross before the last interest rate cut). First-e does not offer an overdraft facility or cheque guarantee card. It does offer a savings account, but you are encouraged to use both accounts as pure internet accounts and you may be charged for making telephone calls. Smile from the Co-operative Bank, pays a top rate of 6% gross on its savings account but to qualify for this you have to have a current account into which you pay your monthly salary or \u00a31,000 a month. In fact, Smile once again topped the league of internet banks in a league table compiled by Gomez, the internet quality measurement firm. The Smile current account pays 4.85% gross AER (compounded interest rate) on interest on credit balances and has an interest-free overdraft facility up to \u00a3500. The savings account pays a better rate of interest if you already have a current account for balances over \u00a31 or more. The basic rate is 5% gross AER but you could earn an extra 1% gross on your savings by opening both a current account and a savings account. Nevertheless, canny investors who were planning to switch their current accounts and who get in quickly can enjoy high rates on credit balances. Gomez has drawn up an Internet Banker Scorecard for current accounts from online banks according to ease of use, customer service, product lines and overall cost. According to the latest report, the league is as follows: 1. Smile 2. Nationwide 3. Cahoot 4. First Direct 5. Royal Bank of Scotland 6. Halifax 7. Intelligent Finance (IF) 8. Abbey National 9. NatWest 10. The Woolwich The interest rate war began when Prudential first launched the Egg account as a loss-leader. The account paid the best interest rate on the market. Although Egg eventually lowered the rate and announced this week that it was putting a planned current account on hold, its internet-only savings account is still competitive. Egg has three savings account options - one is internet-only and the other two offer the option of a telephone or postal account or a cashcard account. \u0095 Marianne Curphey is editor of Guardian Unlimited Money.

Mr Justice Hughes criticised her ethos, which involved children changing their name to Roberts and losing contact with their birth families. </p> <p>The family division of the high court found that Miss Roberts and one of her adopted children, Karen Roberts, who eventually came to help run the Old Convent, in Bicknacre, Essex, encouraged some of the children to make confessions of sexual abuse. It found that Karen Roberts, who suffers from a schizo-affective disorder, also stole \u00a326,000 in criminal injuries compensation from two of these children, with Roberts's knowledge. </p> <p>The court heard allegations from two families that children had been improperly influenced into making claims of sexual abuse and giving false evidence at the Old Bailey.

For 20 minutes he and 23 other beagles are released from their 6ft x 6ft pens and allowed to trot up and down the 60ft passage that separates the cages. Buffalo grubs at a plastic bone, and nuzzles one of his colleagues before being scooped up into the arms of his handler. \"Hello my lovely, my little baby,\" she says, staring down with eyes almost as soppy as his. She has given all the dogs names she says, but Buffalo is her favourite.</p> <p>Buffalo is 12 weeks into his life at Huntingdon, which has the capacity to house more than 1,000 beagles. He is used to the routine; he takes his breakfast, dosed with the substance he is here to test, at around 9am before being returned to the pen. Once an hour to a chorus of excited yelps, a technician walks the passage looking for signs of adverse reactions to the substance.</p> <p>Commercial confidentiality prevents HLS from revealing the nature of the substance Buffalo and co are being exposed to but it could be an agri-chemical, a drug or a food additive. Once a week Buffalo is taken out and weighed, his urine and faeces collected for analysis, and once a month a blood sample is taken. In 40 weeks when the trial is concluded Buffalo will have reached the end of his useful life and will be killed with barbiturates, along with all the other dogs in the trial.</p> <p>This is when the real work begins. Postmortems will be conducted. Samples of all major organs will be taken, slides prepared and treated before being passed to HLS's laboratories where the effects of the substance on the dogs are assessed. Meanwhile the next round of testing will have begun. Buffalo's pen will have been hosed down and another beagle will have taken his place.</p> <p>This unsentimental production line is the way of animal-based research, and very few companies do more of it than HLS, Europe's largest contract research organisation.</p> <p>Speaking three days before he was attacked by hooded men as he returned home on Thursday night, Brian Cass, the managing director and chief executive, bristled at the criticism levelled against HLS by Shac, Stop Huntingdon Life Cruelty, whose campaign has forced HLS to defend its methods and aims to an unprecedented degree.</p> <p>\"We live in a society that demands absolute safety in everything, in the environment, driving your car, the food you eat and the medicines you take. Government has responded to that by seeking the best body of scientific advice available and laying down a series of safety tests which must be carried out for all of these chemicals,\" he said.</p> <p>\"All the work that is done here is governed by probably the toughest piece of legislation governing research anywhere in the world. The first question we have to ask before beginning a project is, 'can the objectives of this study be met by using non-animal studies?' If there isn't then you begin to discuss animal studies. The legislation requires that you use the minimum number of animals and cause the absolute minimum amount of distress.\"</p> <p>Cass insists that other methods of research, including computer modelling and in vitro simulations of human organs, are not sufficiently developed. \"We would all like to believe that one day it would be possible to ensure these levels of safety without using animals but the human body...is a highly complex mechanism that no one really understands.</p> <p>\"Everybody that works here has made an ethical decision about their role,\" says Cass. \"Working here you are in a position where you are challenged in a way you are not if you are making springs or beans. Normal everyday people are doing this work and the last thing they want to see is an animal in distress. The biggest safeguard we have is the people doing the work, because you cannot carry out this research without caring about animals and if you care about them you want high welfare and low stress.\"</p> <p><b> Demands</b><br></p> <p>Around half of the research at HLS involves animals and is designed to meet the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986) which demands that a wide range of drugs, food additives, industrial chemicals and domestic products is tested before being released on to the market. Animals are dosed orally, intravenously or by inhalation to examine the effects of agri-chemicals on fish and other farmed animals in simulated environments.

      "bodyText": "Buffalo, a large, soppy-eyed beagle, is taking his exercise at Huntingdon Life Sciences. For 20 minutes he and 23 other beagles are released from their 6ft x 6ft pens and allowed to trot up and down the 60ft passage that separates the cages. Buffalo grubs at a plastic bone, and nuzzles one of his colleagues before being scooped up into the arms of his handler. \"Hello my lovely, my little baby,\" she says, staring down with eyes almost as soppy as his. She has given all the dogs names she says, but Buffalo is her favourite. Buffalo is 12 weeks into his life at Huntingdon, which has the capacity to house more than 1,000 beagles. He is used to the routine; he takes his breakfast, dosed with the substance he is here to test, at around 9am before being returned to the pen. Once an hour to a chorus of excited yelps, a technician walks the passage looking for signs of adverse reactions to the substance. Commercial confidentiality prevents HLS from revealing the nature of the substance Buffalo and co are being exposed to but it could be an agri-chemical, a drug or a food additive. Once a week Buffalo is taken out and weighed, his urine and faeces collected for analysis, and once a month a blood sample is taken. In 40 weeks when the trial is concluded Buffalo will have reached the end of his useful life and will be killed with barbiturates, along with all the other dogs in the trial. This is when the real work begins. Postmortems will be conducted. Samples of all major organs will be taken, slides prepared and treated before being passed to HLS's laboratories where the effects of the substance on the dogs are assessed. Meanwhile the next round of testing will have begun. Buffalo's pen will have been hosed down and another beagle will have taken his place. This unsentimental production line is the way of animal-based research, and very few companies do more of it than HLS, Europe's largest contract research organisation. Speaking three days before he was attacked by hooded men as he returned home on Thursday night, Brian Cass, the managing director and chief executive, bristled at the criticism levelled against HLS by Shac, Stop Huntingdon Life Cruelty, whose campaign has forced HLS to defend its methods and aims to an unprecedented degree. \"We live in a society that demands absolute safety in everything, in the environment, driving your car, the food you eat and the medicines you take. Government has responded to that by seeking the best body of scientific advice available and laying down a series of safety tests which must be carried out for all of these chemicals,\" he said. \"All the work that is done here is governed by probably the toughest piece of legislation governing research anywhere in the world. The first question we have to ask before beginning a project is, 'can the objectives of this study be met by using non-animal studies?' If there isn't then you begin to discuss animal studies. The legislation requires that you use the minimum number of animals and cause the absolute minimum amount of distress.\" Cass insists that other methods of research, including computer modelling and in vitro simulations of human organs, are not sufficiently developed. \"We would all like to believe that one day it would be possible to ensure these levels of safety without using animals but the human body...is a highly complex mechanism that no one really understands. \"Everybody that works here has made an ethical decision about their role,\" says Cass. \"Working here you are in a position where you are challenged in a way you are not if you are making springs or beans. Normal everyday people are doing this work and the last thing they want to see is an animal in distress. The biggest safeguard we have is the people doing the work, because you cannot carry out this research without caring about animals and if you care about them you want high welfare and low stress.\" Demands Around half of the research at HLS involves animals and is designed to meet the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986) which demands that a wide range of drugs, food additives, industrial chemicals and domestic products is tested before being released on to the market. Animals are dosed orally, intravenously or by inhalation to examine the effects of agri-chemicals on fish and other farmed animals in simulated environments. As a result around 70,000 dogs, monkeys, rats, mice, geese, pigs, sheep, fish, honeybees and earthworms are killed at HLS every year. As we tour the laboratories and animal facilities, the latest in a long line of journalists invited in to HLS in a determined counter-offensive, Cass's faith in his employees' ethical rigour seems justified. Battered by the campaign which characterised them as torturers and in one case \"a murdering paedophile\", they are at pains to explain the welfare procedures and to justify their roles.

Shac and others argue that the use of animals is immoral, ethically unsound and bad science. Greg Avery, Shac's founder, equates the campaign to the ANC's struggle against apartheid and compares pro-animal testing arguments to those Hitler used to justify eugenics.

      "body": "<p>At last. The debate, or at least the material to inform the debate, is being presented to the public by the media. The media, note, not the government, which remains resolute to concentrate on a euro-free election. It will fail. </p> <p>The BBC joined battle with its Europe and Us week; the Observer made a heroic contribution; and the Guardian almost made the euro-debate fashionable, by devoting a cover story to it in its trendy G2 section. </p> <p>For once the Euro-sceptics took a back seat. Apart from the Daily Mail's continuing attack on the planned European rapid reaction force and its impact on Nato, the sceptics were quiet. This has not happened in a long time. </p> <p>But first, a classic example of how the debate is muddled, with data being selected or spun to provide comfort to one side or the other. </p> <p>On the same day, both the Euro-sceptic Sun and the Euro-enthusiastic Mirror carried stories giving the attitudes of finance and big business to the euro. Each story supported the editorial line of the newspaper in which it appeared. </p> <p>So the Sun, under the headline City aces vote 2-1 to keep the pound, said that: \"Britain's top financial gurus ... warned that scrapping the pound would put Britain's booming economy in peril.\" And it quoted an un-named guest at a banquet held by the Futures and Options Association as saying: \"This shows that the world's top moneymen have a clear idea of what's right for this country.\" Is that the way guests at Futures and Options Association banquets speak? I don't know, never having been to one. </p> <p>The rival Mirror had a different take. \"Two-thirds of UK's top firms say join euro,\" ran the headline. The result of the 2001 Reuters Survey of UK Larger Companies was a \"devastating kick in the teeth for William Hague and his euro-sceptic extremists\". </p> <p>The Mirror backed up this article with a leader indicating how strongly it plans to campaign for the euro. The tide is about to turn, it said. \"The signs are good for the government getting the backing it needs. The Mirror believes the choice is this: Do you want your pay in euros or your dole money in pounds?\" </p> <p>The gloves are off between the redtops, and they at least seem to believe that good, old-fashioned campaigning is what is required. The BBC, smarting under attack for pro-euro bias, brought us a week of Euro-programmes. You could easily have missed it, so many were scheduled far away from mainstream hours. </p> <p>The TV contribution was light, although those too young to vote in the referendum were best served with a daily dose of Europe in Newsround. But for adults, the four programmes offered were all after 10 pm. The TV coverage started with the big guns - or these days light peashooters - of Panorama, now buried away late on Sunday night. </p> <p>Referendum Street was a classic example of why television is so bad at handling issues. The need for both balance and pictures serves only to trivialise. Subjecting a single north London street to a euro referendum \"campaign\", and inflicting on the innocent inhabitants a knock on the door from Austin Mitchell and David Mellor was not conducive to high-level debate. </p> <p>Will Hutton, leader of the Referendum Street pro campaign, saw it differently, and in a triumphant piece in the Observer celebrated the fact that Referendum Street had been convinced by the arguments of the pros, an initial anti-euro view in the street being turned into a majority in favour of the euro. </p> <p>Hutton put it down to the pros, like himself, being nicer people. \"Scepticism is a darker credo than the sunnier worldview of the pros,\" he wrote, \"and this comes through in the style, culture and personality type attracted to the twin camps.\" </p> <p>So the real referendum will come down to which camp has more style and culture. One hopes there will be more to it than that. The same edition of the Observer contained by far the most helpful, and accessible, contribution to the debate so far. </p> <p>If the BBC wants to understand how balance can be made interesting it should turn to How to make sense of the euro debate, the Observer's special report last Sunday. Extracted from a new book by Anthony Browne, it dealt fairly and thoroughly with both the economic and political arguments. </p> <p>It accepted that the argument is neither clear-cut nor simple, neither straight bananas nor straight advantage to Britain. It conceded that the emotive and political arguments, about sovereignty and the Queen's head on our banknotes, will be \"far more influential in a referendum than the relatively dry and arcane arguments about economics.\" </p> <p>For those who haven't, it is well worth reading, and is on the Observer website. </p> <p>Things are looking up. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University</p>",

      "bodyText": "At last. The debate, or at least the material to inform the debate, is being presented to the public by the media. The media, note, not the government, which remains resolute to concentrate on a euro-free election. It will fail. The BBC joined battle with its Europe and Us week; the Observer made a heroic contribution; and the Guardian almost made the euro-debate fashionable, by devoting a cover story to it in its trendy G2 section. For once the Euro-sceptics took a back seat. Apart from the Daily Mail's continuing attack on the planned European rapid reaction force and its impact on Nato, the sceptics were quiet. This has not happened in a long time. But first, a classic example of how the debate is muddled, with data being selected or spun to provide comfort to one side or the other. On the same day, both the Euro-sceptic Sun and the Euro-enthusiastic Mirror carried stories giving the attitudes of finance and big business to the euro. Each story supported the editorial line of the newspaper in which it appeared. So the Sun, under the headline City aces vote 2-1 to keep the pound, said that: \"Britain's top financial gurus ... warned that scrapping the pound would put Britain's booming economy in peril.\" And it quoted an un-named guest at a banquet held by the Futures and Options Association as saying: \"This shows that the world's top moneymen have a clear idea of what's right for this country.\" Is that the way guests at Futures and Options Association banquets speak? I don't know, never having been to one. The rival Mirror had a different take. \"Two-thirds of UK's top firms say join euro,\" ran the headline. The result of the 2001 Reuters Survey of UK Larger Companies was a \"devastating kick in the teeth for William Hague and his euro-sceptic extremists\". The Mirror backed up this article with a leader indicating how strongly it plans to campaign for the euro. The tide is about to turn, it said. \"The signs are good for the government getting the backing it needs. The Mirror believes the choice is this: Do you want your pay in euros or your dole money in pounds?\" The gloves are off between the redtops, and they at least seem to believe that good, old-fashioned campaigning is what is required. The BBC, smarting under attack for pro-euro bias, brought us a week of Euro-programmes. You could easily have missed it, so many were scheduled far away from mainstream hours. The TV contribution was light, although those too young to vote in the referendum were best served with a daily dose of Europe in Newsround. But for adults, the four programmes offered were all after 10 pm. The TV coverage started with the big guns - or these days light peashooters - of Panorama, now buried away late on Sunday night. Referendum Street was a classic example of why television is so bad at handling issues. The need for both balance and pictures serves only to trivialise. Subjecting a single north London street to a euro referendum \"campaign\", and inflicting on the innocent inhabitants a knock on the door from Austin Mitchell and David Mellor was not conducive to high-level debate. Will Hutton, leader of the Referendum Street pro campaign, saw it differently, and in a triumphant piece in the Observer celebrated the fact that Referendum Street had been convinced by the arguments of the pros, an initial anti-euro view in the street being turned into a majority in favour of the euro. Hutton put it down to the pros, like himself, being nicer people. \"Scepticism is a darker credo than the sunnier worldview of the pros,\" he wrote, \"and this comes through in the style, culture and personality type attracted to the twin camps.\" So the real referendum will come down to which camp has more style and culture. One hopes there will be more to it than that. The same edition of the Observer contained by far the most helpful, and accessible, contribution to the debate so far. If the BBC wants to understand how balance can be made interesting it should turn to How to make sense of the euro debate, the Observer's special report last Sunday. Extracted from a new book by Anthony Browne, it dealt fairly and thoroughly with both the economic and political arguments. It accepted that the argument is neither clear-cut nor simple, neither straight bananas nor straight advantage to Britain. It conceded that the emotive and political arguments, about sovereignty and the Queen's head on our banknotes, will be \"far more influential in a referendum than the relatively dry and arcane arguments about economics.\" For those who haven't, it is well worth reading, and is on the Observer website. Things are looking up. \u0095 Peter Cole is professor of journalism at Sheffield University",

The Yorkshire-based firm's dramatic reversal in fortune has left several high profile investors nursing heavy losses, including ex-Leeds United boss Chris Akers and former businesswoman of the year 27-year-old Amanda Staveley. Investors who bought into the float at 150p a share saw the stock suspended last night after last trading at 4.5p. A spokesman for the London Stock Exchange emphasised that he could not comment on individual firms, but added, \"we would always look at cases where a company has working capital difficulties within 12 months of a share issue\". PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed as administrator after talks seeking to find a rescuer to ease \"working capital difficulties\" failed. The expected inquiry is likely to focus on how Euro-Telecom, which initially told shareholders that it would not consume big quantities of cash, managed to burn through its financial resources at such a rate. Shareholders have been startled by its sudden misfortune and a bitter split has developed between the company's executive management and non-executive directors. Non-executives, led by Mr Akers in his role as chairman, are thought to have been unhappy at the quality and regularity of management accounts presented to them by chief executive Phil Derry. The non-executives commissioned accountants BDO Stoy Hayward to conduct an independent audit of the figures.

According to police allegations, he \"deliberately waved his sex organs at policewomen . . . and exposed his private parts four or five times\". Paixao counters: \"I am an educated 26-year-old, and I will sue the police for defamation.\" \u0095 Our policy of betting on rank outsiders flopped last week, with all our tips toppled and Deportivo Wanka living up to their name by losing 4-0 at Alianza Lima. So we have changed tack, entering the world of \"multi-league parlays\". We have bet \u00a325 on each of two combinations of 11 results at potentially massive reward. With any luck, a week hence, Diary will be sipping pina coladas on a Cuban beach. Hasta la vista. simon.burnton@theguardian.com",

A number of times I've watched him in matches where he has his back against defenders and commits a few fouls himself, but overall he gets thumped about a bit.\" </p> <p>The in-form winger Bobby Petta is losing his battle to be fit, having already missed out on a possible call-up to the Dutch international squad this week due to injury. </p> <p>Celtic know a win would virtually assure them of the title. They are 14 points clear of Hibs and 15 ahead of Rangers; three points tomorrow would make the gap almost insurmountable. </p> <p>Dundee have signed the Argentine left-back Alberto Garrido in time for today's televised clash with Rangers. The 26-year-old, who has played in Italy and Spain, has signed on a free transfer until the end of the season and could go straight into the team at Dens Park. Player-manager Ivano Bonetti has eight first-team players out injured, including himself. </p> <p>For Rangers, Lorenzo Amoruso is expected to return for his first game since January 2. Kick-off is at 12.55pm and will be televised live for pay-per-view broadcast. </p> <p>Fifth place is at stake at Tynecastle, where Hearts face sixth-placed Dunfermline, one place below them but level on points. </p> <p>The Hearts manager Craig Levein says he will have no hesitation in playing Juanjo despite the Spanish striker turning down the club's offer of a new contract. Juanjo's agent this week broke off negotiations and branded the club's new terms as \"ridiculous.\" </p> <p>The Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson says while he is delighted that Dundee United have started winning games, he still wants to take three points off the league's bottom side when they meet this afternoon. Williamson has no fresh injury worries but Andy McLaren is suspended. The teenager Paul Di Giacomo is drafted into the squad. </p> <p>United have lost just one of their last six, despite struggling to pick up points at the beginning of the campaign. They go into this game after a convincing win against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup last week. United have lost both previous encounters this season, although the Tannadice reverse was overshadowed by a horrific injury to their defender Jamie Fullarton.</p>",

A number of times I've watched him in matches where he has his back against defenders and commits a few fouls himself, but overall he gets thumped about a bit.\" The in-form winger Bobby Petta is losing his battle to be fit, having already missed out on a possible call-up to the Dutch international squad this week due to injury. Celtic know a win would virtually assure them of the title. They are 14 points clear of Hibs and 15 ahead of Rangers; three points tomorrow would make the gap almost insurmountable. Dundee have signed the Argentine left-back Alberto Garrido in time for today's televised clash with Rangers. The 26-year-old, who has played in Italy and Spain, has signed on a free transfer until the end of the season and could go straight into the team at Dens Park. Player-manager Ivano Bonetti has eight first-team players out injured, including himself. For Rangers, Lorenzo Amoruso is expected to return for his first game since January 2. Kick-off is at 12.55pm and will be televised live for pay-per-view broadcast. Fifth place is at stake at Tynecastle, where Hearts face sixth-placed Dunfermline, one place below them but level on points. The Hearts manager Craig Levein says he will have no hesitation in playing Juanjo despite the Spanish striker turning down the club's offer of a new contract. Juanjo's agent this week broke off negotiations and branded the club's new terms as \"ridiculous.\" The Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson says while he is delighted that Dundee United have started winning games, he still wants to take three points off the league's bottom side when they meet this afternoon. Williamson has no fresh injury worries but Andy McLaren is suspended. The teenager Paul Di Giacomo is drafted into the squad. United have lost just one of their last six, despite struggling to pick up points at the beginning of the campaign. They go into this game after a convincing win against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup last week. United have lost both previous encounters this season, although the Tannadice reverse was overshadowed by a horrific injury to their defender Jamie Fullarton.",

Perhaps no new England manager will ever have a clearer view of the game, one less distorted by conventional wisdom, past mistakes, or prejudice. </p> <p>After Wednesday night, Eriksson himself will have passed beyond that state of grace. When the whistle blows to start the friendly against Spain at Villa Park, he will begin to amass a store of first-hand experience with which to colour his future judgments. His opinions will no longer be based on purely objective criteria but on the knowledge of what players have done, or failed to do, for him. </p> <p>This first squad is, then, particularly interesting, while not being remotely definitive. He admitted yesterday that after watching 20 matches around England in six weeks, plus a trip to Madrid to watch Steve McManaman, he could not guarantee the accuracy of his judgment on all 31 members of the squad. \"We might have made some errors,\" he said. \"We might have left some players out who should be in, and put some in who should be out. Who knows? But the door is definitely open to all English players.\" </p> <p>By allowing himself an unusually large selection - something which, he said, will not be repeated - Eriksson not only gave himself some insurance against this weekend's inevitable crop of injuries, but took advantage of the chance to make a lot of players feel appreciated. These include the young and the old, the much decorated and the previously overlooked. </p> <p>In the last category, the inclusion of Chris Powell of Charlton Athletic and Ugo Ehiogu of Middlesbrough sends out a particularly powerful message. Every English player in the Premiership now knows that he has spent the last six weeks playing for a place in Eriksson's thoughts, which is no bad thing to be told. </p> <p>With an average age of 28, the squad reflects the general belief that international players reach their peak in their late twenties. It also mirrors the nature of Eriksson's squad at Lazio. Even when money was no object in acquiring the world's finest talent, he chose to place his faith in such veterans as Diego Simeone and Fabrizio Ravanelli. \"Age is not important to me,\" he said yesterday, \"as long as they can do the job.\" </p> <p>His first England selection shows no particular bias - with one exception. The inclusion of eight Manchester United players, Eriksson said, should be \"no big surprise to anyone\" in the light of their good form in the league and in Europe, and his words hinted that the Old Trafford contingent will form the spine of the team. With the exception of Teddy Sheringham, 34, and Wes Brown, 21, all the United players are between 24 and 28, and should therefore be around their prime at the time of the 2002 World Cup. </p> <p>United sent Eriksson mixed messages in their 1-1 draw against Valencia at home in the Champions League on Tuesday night, starting well but losing their shape and momentum after a quarter of an hour. David Beckham showed little of the spirit expected from a pretender to the captain's armband, but Andy Cole took his goal with cool precision and Eriksson's comments yesterday made it clear that the 28-year-old's experience in Europe counts for more than his failure to score in 10 international appearances to date. </p> <p>While making the most of the understanding the United players have developed under Sir Alex Ferguson, Eriksson is unlikely to go as far as Ron Greenwood, who marked his debut as England manager in 1977 by picking seven Liverpool players and received scant reward for his faith in a dismal goalless draw with Switzerland at Wembley. </p> <p>The inclusion of West Ham's young midfield trio is less likely to be reflected in the starting line-up, although one or two may come on as substitutes. \"Joe Cole is a big talent, one of the biggest I've seen in this country so far,\" Eriksson said, giving encouragement to those who believe that the youngest Cole's talent is a key to England's fortunes over the next decade. </p> <p>There are places for complete tyros, such as Gavin McCann and Ashley Cole, and for those who might have feared that they had passed their sell-by date, like Seaman, or blown their chance, such as Kevin Phillips, who gets a call despite performing without distinction twice under the manager's gaze. </p> <p>Keen to establish good relationships with club managers, Eriksson explained that the decision to omit Steven Gerrard came after a conversation with Gerard Houllier, who told Eriksson that the young midfielder would be able to play either for Liverpool in the Worthington Cup final on Sunday or for England on Wednesday, but not both. \"We decided it would be best for him to stay at Liverpool and do his normal work,\" Eriksson said. \"We don't want to destroy his future either with England or with Liverpool.\" </p> <p>Eriksson paid tribute to the \"extremely positive\" welcome he has received in England. \"Everywhere I've been I've felt at home, and I'd like to say thank you to everyone for that, from the car-park attendants to the chairmen of all the clubs who have greeted me as a friend. Also to the supporters - I've heard a lot of 'Good luck' and 'Come on, Sven'. I know that this has been a honeymoon. I don't know if it's finished yet. I'll tell you that next weekend, when I start going to matches again.\" </p> <p>For a man who has spent the past 20 years in daily contact with players, the last six weeks have been a curious experience. \"I've never watched so many football matches in my life,\" he said. On Monday morning, when he meets the squad for the first time, the watching stops and the work begins.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The intense study of English football recently undertaken by Sven-Goran Eriksson and his assistant, Tord Grip, has apparently been an exercise in mass observation. Yesterday the nation's new Swedish coach announced a squad big enough to fill a single-decker bus, leaving standing room only. </p> <p>For Eriksson's inaugural match, the friendly against Spain at Villa Park on Wednesday, the England side will be selected from 31 players provided everyone comes through the weekend unscathed. Eriksson has promised to make generous substitutions but for all to be involved England would need to be taking on Spain at football, rugby and rowing's coxed fours. </p> <p>\"Squads of this size will not be the norm,\" Eriksson explained yesterday. \"It is just that for my first game I want to talk to as many players as possible and get to know them. Who knows, we might have forgotten some, although I have to say that never in my life have I seen so many matches in such a short space of time.\" </p> <p>For those omitted, apart from the likes of Gareth Southgate, Martin Keown and Steven Gerrard, who are unfit, the international prospects are bleak indeed. Paul Ince and Dennis Wise, who might have harboured some hope of a recall, and David Batty, who like Stuart Pearce and Paul Merson would have been amazed to get a mention, can consider themselves not forgotten but passed over. </p> <p>Then again there may still be hope for everybody. Take Christopher George Robin Powell, a 31-year-old left-back whose career largely involved trudging around the lower divisions until he tasted Premiership football first with Derby County and now with Charlton Athletic. </p> <p>Ten years ago Powell, then at Crystal Palace, was on loan at Aldershot. Now he finds himself jostling for an England left-back vacancy made more open by Gareth Barry's switch to the Under-21s, Graeme le Saux's lack of action at Chelsea and the non-inclusion of Sunderland's Michael Gray. </p> <p>Doubtless Powell's cause has not been hindered by the fact that he has played for Eriksson's two English assistants, Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren, at Southend and Derby. \"I have spoken to both but not specifically about this player,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"But Powell is a good left defender, so why not have a look at him?\" </p> <p>Presumably as much goes for Everton's Michael Ball, now impressing as a centre-back but originally a promising left wing-back, and Ashley Cole, the remarkably composed and confident Arsenal 20-year-old who has been standing in at left-back for the injured Silvinho. \"I was told England had no left-backs,\" said Eriksson, who has also recalled Manchester United's Phil Neville to emphasise the duffness of such information. </p> <p>Manchester United players make up a quarter of Eriksson's squad and arguably only Phil Neville and Nicky Butt would struggle to get into an England 22. \"This is natural,\" said Eriksson. \"Manchester United are top of the Premier League and doing well in the Champions League.\" </p> <p>More significant may be the fact that Eriksson has also included the trio of young West Ham United midfielders who four weeks ago outpassed, outmanoeuvred and outwitted Sir Alex Ferguson's team in an FA Cup tie at Old Trafford. Joe Cole (19), Michael Carrick (19) and Frank Lampard (22) are all there; unlikely to play as a unit against Spain but already bringing a mist to the eyes of those old enough to recall the contribution made by Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst, all Upton Park academicians, to England's 1966 World Cup triumph. </p> <p>\"We have seen West Ham a lot,\" said Eriksson, \"and these three players are excellent talents. Joe Cole, like Ashley Cole, may not yet be 100% ready for England, but if they are in the squad they will have a chance of playing.\" </p> <p>The size of Eriksson's choice has enabled him to acknowledge the fast-maturing talents of the teens and twentysomethings while giving himself the option of retaining the experience of someone like Teddy Sheringham, 35 in April. Yet he has only the Spain friendly in which to form an opinion about the shape and substance of the teams he will field in the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania at the end of next month, so his room for experiment is limited. Barring injuries, therefore, it seems that Sol Campbell, a possible captain, and Wes Brown or Rio Ferdinand will play in the middle of a back four flanked by Gary Neville and Powell or Ashley Cole. David Seaman may start in goal against Spain but Nigel Martyn or David James will probably finish. In midfield Kieron Dyer and Steve McManaman could be the wide men with David Beckham and Paul Scholes in the central positions, although Beckham is just as likely to be on the right wing with Dyer in the middle. </p> <p>Up front it might be Emile Heskey and Michael Owen unless Eriksson feels that Scholes would be better playing off Heskey, with Jamie Carragher keeping a place warm for yet another Liverpool player, the injured Steven Gerrard, at the back of the midfield. The absence of Gerrard is a bad blow for Eriksson's chances of quickly getting the chemistry right in an area where England floundered during last summer's European Championship. </p> <p>The identity of the players who will form Eriksson's first England line-up will be less important than how the team is asked to play and how it responds. \"Revolution?\" said Eriksson yesterday. \"Off the pitch I don't think so, on the pitch let's hope. I'm going to try to do it my way, whether or not that's a revolution I don't know. </p> <p>\"Of course I'm a little nervous. It's a new beginning dealing with new performers and a new team; a bit like meeting a woman. How will the meeting end up?\" </p> <p>Not, one trusts, with a slap in the face. </p> <p> <strong> England</strong> (possible, 4-4-1-1): Seaman; G Neville, Brown, Campbell, Ashley Cole; Dyer, Beckham, Carragher, McManaman; Scholes; Heskey.</p>",

Who knows, we might have forgotten some, although I have to say that never in my life have I seen so many matches in such a short space of time.\" For those omitted, apart from the likes of Gareth Southgate, Martin Keown and Steven Gerrard, who are unfit, the international prospects are bleak indeed. Paul Ince and Dennis Wise, who might have harboured some hope of a recall, and David Batty, who like Stuart Pearce and Paul Merson would have been amazed to get a mention, can consider themselves not forgotten but passed over. Then again there may still be hope for everybody. Take Christopher George Robin Powell, a 31-year-old left-back whose career largely involved trudging around the lower divisions until he tasted Premiership football first with Derby County and now with Charlton Athletic. Ten years ago Powell, then at Crystal Palace, was on loan at Aldershot. Now he finds himself jostling for an England left-back vacancy made more open by Gareth Barry's switch to the Under-21s, Graeme le Saux's lack of action at Chelsea and the non-inclusion of Sunderland's Michael Gray. Doubtless Powell's cause has not been hindered by the fact that he has played for Eriksson's two English assistants, Peter Taylor and Steve McClaren, at Southend and Derby. \"I have spoken to both but not specifically about this player,\" Eriksson said yesterday. \"But Powell is a good left defender, so why not have a look at him?\" Presumably as much goes for Everton's Michael Ball, now impressing as a centre-back but originally a promising left wing-back, and Ashley Cole, the remarkably composed and confident Arsenal 20-year-old who has been standing in at left-back for the injured Silvinho. \"I was told England had no left-backs,\" said Eriksson, who has also recalled Manchester United's Phil Neville to emphasise the duffness of such information. Manchester United players make up a quarter of Eriksson's squad and arguably only Phil Neville and Nicky Butt would struggle to get into an England 22. \"This is natural,\" said Eriksson. \"Manchester United are top of the Premier League and doing well in the Champions League.\" More significant may be the fact that Eriksson has also included the trio of young West Ham United midfielders who four weeks ago outpassed, outmanoeuvred and outwitted Sir Alex Ferguson's team in an FA Cup tie at Old Trafford. Joe Cole (19), Michael Carrick (19) and Frank Lampard (22) are all there; unlikely to play as a unit against Spain but already bringing a mist to the eyes of those old enough to recall the contribution made by Bobby Moore, Martin Peters and Geoff Hurst, all Upton Park academicians, to England's 1966 World Cup triumph. \"We have seen West Ham a lot,\" said Eriksson, \"and these three players are excellent talents. Joe Cole, like Ashley Cole, may not yet be 100% ready for England, but if they are in the squad they will have a chance of playing.\" The size of Eriksson's choice has enabled him to acknowledge the fast-maturing talents of the teens and twentysomethings while giving himself the option of retaining the experience of someone like Teddy Sheringham, 35 in April. Yet he has only the Spain friendly in which to form an opinion about the shape and substance of the teams he will field in the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania at the end of next month, so his room for experiment is limited. Barring injuries, therefore, it seems that Sol Campbell, a possible captain, and Wes Brown or Rio Ferdinand will play in the middle of a back four flanked by Gary Neville and Powell or Ashley Cole. David Seaman may start in goal against Spain but Nigel Martyn or David James will probably finish. In midfield Kieron Dyer and Steve McManaman could be the wide men with David Beckham and Paul Scholes in the central positions, although Beckham is just as likely to be on the right wing with Dyer in the middle. Up front it might be Emile Heskey and Michael Owen unless Eriksson feels that Scholes would be better playing off Heskey, with Jamie Carragher keeping a place warm for yet another Liverpool player, the injured Steven Gerrard, at the back of the midfield. The absence of Gerrard is a bad blow for Eriksson's chances of quickly getting the chemistry right in an area where England floundered during last summer's European Championship. The identity of the players who will form Eriksson's first England line-up will be less important than how the team is asked to play and how it responds. \"Revolution?\" said Eriksson yesterday. \"Off the pitch I don't think so, on the pitch let's hope. I'm going to try to do it my way, whether or not that's a revolution I don't know. \"Of course I'm a little nervous. It's a new beginning dealing with new performers and a new team; a bit like meeting a woman. How will the meeting end up?\" Not, one trusts, with a slap in the face. England (possible, 4-4-1-1): Seaman; G Neville, Brown, Campbell, Ashley Cole; Dyer, Beckham, Carragher, McManaman; Scholes; Heskey.",

      "body": "<p>The thing to remember about Gerard Houllier is that, for all the mildly academic air, reminding us that he was once a schoolteacher, and the occasional dramatised shrug in the style of Henri Leconte, he comes from the coalfields and his father was a small-town butcher. Civilised, amusing, convivial, thoughtful, a believer that \"in this job you need a philosophy and a vision\", Houllier is also a realist, fully prepared to send his players out with their sleeves rolled up and ready to fight for a result against a more accomplished side, as they did against Roma at Anfield in Thursday's Uefa Cup tie. </p> <p>You do not graduate with honours from places like Arras, Lens and Noeux-les-Mines - the small club famous for producing the great Raymond Kopa, the son of an immigrant Polish miner - without acquiring a knowledge of the harsher arts of football management, and during his first two years with Liverpool he needed to apply all the lessons of his apprenticeship in northern France. And at times, under pressure from the expectations of an army of devoted fans with long memories, the strain showed. </p> <p>This time last year, for example, Houllier was feeling more than a little frustrated. Eliminated from both domestic cup competitions, inconsistent in the league, not involved in Europe, his team played only two competitive fixtures in the month of February. In order to keep them match-fit, he had to take them to Malta to play a friendly. Tomorrow, by contrast, when Liverpool travel to Cardiff to meet Birmingham City in the Worthington Cup final, it will be for their sixth competitive match in 23 days. </p> <p>So now, with the pressure at its most intense, is the time when even the most sceptical season-ticket holder can begin to glimpse the results of the work the 53-year-old Frenchman has done since he took sole charge of the club in December 1998, requesting the fans to show patience. The rebuilding not just of the team but of the club's morale, the expansion of the squad (at a net cost of around \u00a320m), and the application of his footballing philosophy are all on display as Liverpool attack on four fronts. The sense of exhilaration and renewal around the club is as hard to miss as the giant steel frame of the new training centre rising at Melwood, overlooking the pitches on which generations of Liverpool heroes have honed their craft. </p> <p>Tomorrow comes the new generation's first chance to establish themselves as winners in the Liverpool tradition. \"It would mean a lot,\" Houllier said earlier this week, \"because of this club's history. To me it would probably mean a significant boost to the confidence of the team. It would say to them, 'We can do it and we can keep on going.' We want to keep that momentum. If you win something along the way, it increases the self-belief of the players. We have the squad to cope with it, and the way I see them they feel relaxed and happy to be challenging on every front.\" </p> <p>For all the present wave of optimism it will not be until the end of the season, when the final results are in, that he can say for sure whether the Liverpool renaissance is on schedule. \"If you look at where we are right now, it shows a massive improvement compared to two years ago and one year ago,\" he said. \"We're in the last eight of the Uefa Cup and the FA Cup, we're in the last two of the Worthington Cup and we're third in the Premier League. Last season we finished fourth and we want to improve on that. If you ask any member of the playing staff, he will say that playing in the Champions League is the target.\" </p> <p>Houllier is not slow to point out the issues - such as the purchase of Emile Heskey and Vladimir Smicer - on which his critics have been proved wrong. \"The funny thing when you're a manager is that you sometimes smile because people discover things that you spotted about two years ago,\" he said. \"I always thought Vladimir was a really talented player who could do a good job for us. Last season he was knocked back by injuries but this season his record is practically as good in terms of goal assists as Beckham's for Manchester United, which is a reference point. And he's scored eight goals, something like that. He was unfairly criticised because he was not physical. Maybe people didn't like Vladimir because he doesn't kick people. He just kicks the ball. And if you ask every member of the playing staff here, they'd say it's better to have him with us.\" </p> <p>The return to form and fitness of Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen is also a cause for satisfaction, although Houllier reacts badly when the term \"rotation\" is heard in connection with his strikers. \"I don't like the word,\" he said. \"It's never been used by me. You sometimes feel that you have to rest players because you want to keep them fresh. When you're tired and you're less sharp, you're not so quick on your feet and then you pick up an injury. I rested Robbie against Manchester City in the league and three days later he scored two goals against West Ham.\" </p> <p>Nor was Houllier ever worried about Owen's future at a time when the prodigy's goalscoring instinct appeared to desert him. \"I thought he was fine even when he was missing some chances. At least he got himself into position to score. I'm not worried about him because he's strong-willed. He's a winner in his soul. He's still a young boy, only just 21, and he needs a bit of time to build up his game. I don't want to have a Ronaldo thing and lose him.\" </p> <p>The reaction to the first of Owen's goals in Rome showed Houllier the strength of the squad's collective spirit. \"When your bench celebrates a goal the way they did, and when the guy who scored comes to the bench like that, then I'd say you've got a good team unity building around that.\" </p> <p>The squad is also now flexible enough to absorb the long-term absence of two playmakers, Jamie Redknapp and Patrik Berger, while integrating such recent arrivals as Igor Biscan, the 22-year-old midfielder from Croatia Zagreb, and Gregory Vignal, the 19-year-old full-back from Montpellier. Both these newcomers, although at very different stages of their careers, looked equally at home on their recent debuts. </p> <p>But the most significant new acquisition is undoubtedly Jari Litmanen, signed for nothing from Barcelona after three months of quiet negotiations. \"We took him as a fourth striker, but I wanted a different profile from the others,\" Houllier said. \"He's a go-between, a link player between the midfield and the attack - more of a nine and a half, as we say in France. He's a good passer who likes to make the final pass, and he gives different options to whoever is playing with him. He's also tougher than I would have thought. He may be a star player but to me he's a team player. That's the main thing.\" </p> <p>Litmanen's absence through injury was keenly felt as Liverpool battled against Roma at Anfield on Thursday, and there is a belief that the Finn's arrival could have the same effect as that of Houllier's friend Eric Cantona, another \"nine and a half\" who became the unexpected catalyst of success at Manchester United. \"We'll see. You media like to label people very quickly. That's easy. But I don't know yet. I need to see more of him. All I know is that every time he's come on, he's done well.\" </p> <p>Like his compatriots Arsene Wenger and Jean Tigana, Houllier holds on to his sanity within the madness of the English game by insisting on his right to personal privacy. He is acutely aware of the ability of English newspapers to exploit the most innocuous revelation and, although we know he likes books and music, it may be some time before we discover whether this French exile prefers Camus to Sartre or Francoise Hardy to France Gall. </p> <p>What we do know is that he loves football and footballers, a feeling that began when he watched his father play for the town team, and he was willing to talk, at least, about the man who most profoundly shaped his approach to handling players. </p> <p>\"I'm not somebody who has heroes,\" he said, in answer to a question about people who had impressed or influenced him as a young man. \"You take some bits of philosophy from many people and adapt them to what you do. But one of the managers I worked with, when I was a young assistant at Noeux-les-Mines, was Guy de Beugny. He's not well known but I think he was probably 10 years ahead of time, if not 20, in coaching and preparation of the players. He was really the one who totally changed my approach. </p> <p>\"He was a thinker. He showed me things I had never seen before, despite all the courses I'd been on. He could prepare a team to counter-attack, or to play build-up football, or to play possession football. It was a very forward-thinking and modern approach, in which everything starts from skills. Even if you're working on the physical side, do it through skills. And the players improved a lot. I think the success I've had is owed to him. Maybe you're disappointed. Maybe you'd have expected me to say Herrera. Or Capello . . .\" </p> <p>Well, Helenio Herrera, maybe, after the uncharacteristic display of quasi-catenaccio defending which narrowly thwarted Fabio Capello's Roma this week. But Houllier is by nature a progressive, and his central role in the recent success of French football, as national coach and then technical director, is reflected in the pride he takes in the achievements of French players and coaches in England. </p> <p>\"First of all, I'm proud that the players play good football and show a good image. They're good ambassadors for French football. And I'm very proud of what Arsene has done and what Jean is doing at the moment. Three French managers here, we're under a bit more pressure. We've got to be good. And I always thought Jean would be a good manager. Very strong guy, good personality, great sense of humour. And he's a winner.\" </p> <p>In a recent interview with a French magazine Houllier appeared to hint at an eventual return home, possibly to another job with the federation. It was a distortion, he said this week, in the sense that he was merely giving a polite reply to a question about whether he would consider such an offer, were it ever made. </p> <p>\"The thing is, I have no plan and absolutely no agenda. Three months before the World Cup in 1998 I didn't know I was going to come here. All I knew was that I'd been 10 years with the national team and at the age of 51 you look at yourself in the mirror and say, do you want to go back into the firing line? And the offer from Liverpool came in.\" </p> <p>He may not have a plan - and the length of his contract is something else he will not discuss - but, when the Anfield mission has been completed, might he not fancy a move to Italy, say, or Spain? </p> <p>\"No. I like it too much here. I'm a bit like Arsene in that respect. We like the people, we like the country, I like the culture. A Premiership game is always exciting, you know?\" And English football, in return, is more exciting for the presence of an increasingly vibrant and authoritative Liverpool side, apparently ready to take the next step.</p>",

And he's scored eight goals, something like that. He was unfairly criticised because he was not physical. Maybe people didn't like Vladimir because he doesn't kick people. He just kicks the ball. And if you ask every member of the playing staff here, they'd say it's better to have him with us.\" The return to form and fitness of Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen is also a cause for satisfaction, although Houllier reacts badly when the term \"rotation\" is heard in connection with his strikers. \"I don't like the word,\" he said. \"It's never been used by me. You sometimes feel that you have to rest players because you want to keep them fresh. When you're tired and you're less sharp, you're not so quick on your feet and then you pick up an injury. I rested Robbie against Manchester City in the league and three days later he scored two goals against West Ham.\" Nor was Houllier ever worried about Owen's future at a time when the prodigy's goalscoring instinct appeared to desert him. \"I thought he was fine even when he was missing some chances. At least he got himself into position to score. I'm not worried about him because he's strong-willed. He's a winner in his soul. He's still a young boy, only just 21, and he needs a bit of time to build up his game. I don't want to have a Ronaldo thing and lose him.\" The reaction to the first of Owen's goals in Rome showed Houllier the strength of the squad's collective spirit. \"When your bench celebrates a goal the way they did, and when the guy who scored comes to the bench like that, then I'd say you've got a good team unity building around that.\" The squad is also now flexible enough to absorb the long-term absence of two playmakers, Jamie Redknapp and Patrik Berger, while integrating such recent arrivals as Igor Biscan, the 22-year-old midfielder from Croatia Zagreb, and Gregory Vignal, the 19-year-old full-back from Montpellier. Both these newcomers, although at very different stages of their careers, looked equally at home on their recent debuts. But the most significant new acquisition is undoubtedly Jari Litmanen, signed for nothing from Barcelona after three months of quiet negotiations. \"We took him as a fourth striker, but I wanted a different profile from the others,\" Houllier said. \"He's a go-between, a link player between the midfield and the attack - more of a nine and a half, as we say in France. He's a good passer who likes to make the final pass, and he gives different options to whoever is playing with him. He's also tougher than I would have thought. He may be a star player but to me he's a team player. That's the main thing.\" Litmanen's absence through injury was keenly felt as Liverpool battled against Roma at Anfield on Thursday, and there is a belief that the Finn's arrival could have the same effect as that of Houllier's friend Eric Cantona, another \"nine and a half\" who became the unexpected catalyst of success at Manchester United. \"We'll see. You media like to label people very quickly. That's easy. But I don't know yet. I need to see more of him. All I know is that every time he's come on, he's done well.\" Like his compatriots Arsene Wenger and Jean Tigana, Houllier holds on to his sanity within the madness of the English game by insisting on his right to personal privacy. He is acutely aware of the ability of English newspapers to exploit the most innocuous revelation and, although we know he likes books and music, it may be some time before we discover whether this French exile prefers Camus to Sartre or Francoise Hardy to France Gall. What we do know is that he loves football and footballers, a feeling that began when he watched his father play for the town team, and he was willing to talk, at least, about the man who most profoundly shaped his approach to handling players. \"I'm not somebody who has heroes,\" he said, in answer to a question about people who had impressed or influenced him as a young man. \"You take some bits of philosophy from many people and adapt them to what you do. But one of the managers I worked with, when I was a young assistant at Noeux-les-Mines, was Guy de Beugny. He's not well known but I think he was probably 10 years ahead of time, if not 20, in coaching and preparation of the players. He was really the one who totally changed my approach. \"He was a thinker. He showed me things I had never seen before, despite all the courses I'd been on. He could prepare a team to counter-attack, or to play build-up football, or to play possession football. It was a very forward-thinking and modern approach, in which everything starts from skills. Even if you're working on the physical side, do it through skills. And the players improved a lot. I think the success I've had is owed to him. Maybe you're disappointed. Maybe you'd have expected me to say Herrera. Or Capello . . .\" Well, Helenio Herrera, maybe, after the uncharacteristic display of quasi-catenaccio defending which narrowly thwarted Fabio Capello's Roma this week. But Houllier is by nature a progressive, and his central role in the recent success of French football, as national coach and then technical director, is reflected in the pride he takes in the achievements of French players and coaches in England. \"First of all, I'm proud that the players play good football and show a good image. They're good ambassadors for French football. And I'm very proud of what Arsene has done and what Jean is doing at the moment. Three French managers here, we're under a bit more pressure. We've got to be good. And I always thought Jean would be a good manager. Very strong guy, good personality, great sense of humour. And he's a winner.\" In a recent interview with a French magazine Houllier appeared to hint at an eventual return home, possibly to another job with the federation. It was a distortion, he said this week, in the sense that he was merely giving a polite reply to a question about whether he would consider such an offer, were it ever made. \"The thing is, I have no plan and absolutely no agenda. Three months before the World Cup in 1998 I didn't know I was going to come here. All I knew was that I'd been 10 years with the national team and at the age of 51 you look at yourself in the mirror and say, do you want to go back into the firing line? And the offer from Liverpool came in.\" He may not have a plan - and the length of his contract is something else he will not discuss - but, when the Anfield mission has been completed, might he not fancy a move to Italy, say, or Spain? \"No. I like it too much here. I'm a bit like Arsene in that respect. We like the people, we like the country, I like the culture. A Premiership game is always exciting, you know?\" And English football, in return, is more exciting for the presence of an increasingly vibrant and authoritative Liverpool side, apparently ready to take the next step.",

A melodrama for reciter and piano, it was written in 1897 for the sometime actor Ernst von Possart, who was Strauss's boss at the Munich Court Opera. Tennyson's poem is the source. Enoch, a mariner who has fallen on hard times, sets off on a voyage to the orient, only to be shipwrecked on a desert island on the return journey. He's eventually rescued and returns to England to find that his wife Annie, believing him dead, has married their childhood friend Phillip. Enoch conceals his identity and spends the rest of his life living a lie so that the couple can remain in peace. </p> <p>Tennyson might seem an odd choice for Strauss, though the poem examines several themes that he was later to explore more fully in his operas. The emphasis on the formation of new relationships as a consolation for the desperation of abandonment prefigures Ariadne auf Naxos. There's more than a hint of Rosenkavalier in Enoch's decision to sacrifice himself for the happiness of his beloved. There's also a strong whiff of anti-clericalism in the work. Tennyson uses the tale to question the workings of a seemingly less than beneficent deity. This may have appealed to Strauss, who was an atheist. </p> <p>Vickers, however, is a committed Christian and he strips the vein of sardonic irony from the piece to replace it with intense religious fervour. His delivery is slow, incantatory. He speaks as he once sang, with a mixture of delicacy and raw power. His voice remains beautiful, its bronze tone undimmed by age. He has a fondness for lingering over pauses which occasionally breaks the flow of the verse, though there are terrifying moments - Annie's grief, Enoch's horror when he realises what has happened in his absence - where Vickers scales the tremendous heights of declamatory, tragic intensity that infused his operatic performances and made him one of the greatest of postwar artists. </p> <p>The piano-writing, which punctuates the narrative rather than illustrates it, betrays a strong debt to Schumann and more of Brahms's influence than Strauss would ever have admitted. But there are some wonderful effects - pungent chromatic surging, and weird, uneasy trickles over sustained pedals - and Vickers's accompanist, the Brazilian Jose Feghali, plays it immaculately.

The moves will put pressure on other leading lenders to slash their borrowing costs too or risk facing an exodus of unhappy customers. </p> <p>It's great news for consumers but people shouldn't get too carried away by their apparent phenomenal generosity. Look closely and you'll find some caveats and catches lurking in the small print. And remember that lower mortgage rates usually mean cuts in savings rates. </p> <p>First the good news. If you're a borrower with the Halifax or the Nationwide, you are on the standard variable mortgage rate and you're not tied in by early redemption penalties, you are quids in. Halifax has announced that its new variable rate will be 6.75%, down from 7.5%, which means someone with an average \u00a360,000 repayment mortgage will see their monthly payments fall from \u00a3448.55 to \u00a3414.54 - a saving of \u00a334.01 a month, or \u00a3408 over a year. </p> <p>Meanwhile Nationwide is switching more than 500,000 standard variable rate borrowers on to its new \"base mortgage rate,\" which means that the interest they pay falls from 7.09% to 6.49%. A customer with a \u00a360,000 repayment mortgage will save \u00a323.01 a month, or \u00a3276 a year. </p> <p>But Halifax borrowers won't be transferred automatically on to the new lower rate - they will have to ask to be moved. That means borrowers who are either unaware of the change or who don't get round to asking to be transferred will stay stuck on the higher rate. </p> <p>As an added plus, Halifax is moving from annual to daily interest calculation for its borrowers, which reduces your costs and means that though Nationwide boasts the lower rate, both lenders' rates work out broadly similar over the long term. </p> <p>Halifax is also promising that its new variable rate will track the Bank of England base rate for the rest of this year, while Nationwide guarantees that its base mortgage rate will never be more than 2% above the base rate. </p> <p>However, while close to 1m Halifax and Nationwide borrowers are benefiting immediately, around 2.75m others will see much smaller cuts or no reduction at all in what they pay. </p> <p>Looking at the Halifax announcement first, it needs to be made clear that an existing customer on one of its discounted rate mortgages will not see their rate tumble by 0.75% - what they pay will still be based on the old 7.5% standard rate, minus the amount of their discount. However, when they get to the end of the discounted period they will move to the new lower variable rate. </p> <p>Borrowers who had a Halifax discounted or fixed-rate deal and are now locked into the standard variable rate for one or more years will also stay on the old 7.5% rate, though the bank will allow them to switch into another Halifax deal and bring the redemption penalty with them. </p> <p>Nationwide's new arrangements are complicated too. While it is introducing the new 6.49% base mortgage rate for all new and many existing customers, it is keeping a substantial number of its borrowers on its old standard variable rate, though it has sweetened the pill a bit by cutting it slightly from 7.09% to 6.99%. </p> <p>Existing customers with discounted rate and cash back mortgages will continue to pay this standard rate, or a discount off it, as will borrowers who are now locked in to the standard rate for a period after enjoying a discount or fixed rate. At the end of the deal they will automatically be moved on to the new lower mortgage rate. </p> <p>All eyes are now on other lenders to see whether they match the rate cuts announced by Halifax and Nationwide. </p> <p>But if you're already fed-up with all these mortgage melodramatics, you ain't seen nothing yet. </p> <p>Nationwide says it will be mounting a full-scale campaign over the issue of banks overcharging borrowers, while Halifax revealed it is planning a new spring television advertising campaign similar to the one with singing bank cashier Howard Brown - this time with a member of staff trilling about its new lower mortgage rate.</p>",

I also wish McPherson would return to the dynamic interchange of dialogue. But he writes like a recording Irish angel and, for a man who is barely 30, has an uncanny empathy with older generations. The best story is that of the dim Dermot, who, thrust into a fantasy world of hot women, VIP lounges and cocaine snorts, realises he is sustained only by his neglected, immensely tolerant wife. </p> <p>McPherson directs his play with unadorned simplicity, punctuating the stories with the clang of a ship's bell. His actors also do him proud. Eanna MacLiam has all the bright-eyed naivete of a young man shying away from love. Stephen Brennan perfectly captures the wild comedy of a middle-aged no-hoper embroiled in a shiny world of success.

If the leading counsel hired by Mr Treves, himself a senior lawyer, finds grounds to contest the law lords judgement last summer, this could eventually result in Equitable Life's policyholders being returned to the position they were in early last year. This would mean the 90,000 holders of so-called guaranteed annuity policies would not be owed \u00a31.5bn in payments which the law lords ruled they had been unfairly denied. It would also mean that holders of policies which are not guaranteed would no longer face reductions in their policies to rectify the position of those with guarantees. He has hired leading silk Nicholas Warren QC to explore whether the judgment can be \"amended\" in some way, and Mr Warren - who has wide experience of financial cases and sometimes sits as a judge - will deliver his initial view early next month. But because Mr Treves, who officially takes up his position on March 1, acknowledges that finding grounds to try to overturn the ruling by the highest judges in the land was a \"long shot\", he will set up a \"war room\" next week to try to formulate a compromise between the two groups of policyholders. \"It will be a group of people whose first and absolutely non-negotiable priority will be to put together a compromise which is technically foolproof but is also easy to articulate, understand and absorb,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>Lloyds TSB last night remained resolute in its determination to take over Abbey National even though its \u00a319bn bid faces a four-month delay because of an investigation by the competition authorities. </p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, finally referred the controversial bid to the competition commission and the hostility between Abbey and Lloyds escalated. </p> <p>Abbey also indicated that it was prepared to press ahead to try to consummate its merger with Bank of Scotland, even while the investigation into the Lloyds deal - which would involve 9,000 job cuts and 600 branch closures - was continuing. BoS described the situation as \"dynamic\". </p> <p>Shares in all three banks fell on the news, which had the effect of reducing the value of Lloyds's offer to \u00a317bn, or just above \u00a312 for each Abbey National share; the price fell 36p to \u00a311.03 yesterday. </p> <p>Mark Pain, finance director of Abbey, which is refusing to succumb to Lloyds TSB's advances, likened his predator to the troubled retailer Marks &amp; Spencer. \"They've got a chairman [Sir Brian Pitman] who stayed too long and chief executive [Peter Ellwood] who's no good for the job,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Byers gave the competition commission until June 12 to submit its report on Lloyds's bid, which he said had raised concern at the office of fair trading about current accounts and small business. </p> <p>Even though Mr Byers insisted he had followed the advice given to him, this failed to prevent criticism by City analysts that political pressures were playing a role so close to an election. This was heightened by the fact that Mr Byers had left the publication of his decision until the last moment. </p> <p>The City believes that Lloyds' ambitions to take over Abbey National are in effect on hold until the verdict of the competition commission. \"The proposed merger would lead to the elimination from the market of one of the the most significant branch based competitors to the UK's four largest banks,\" Mr Byers said. \"This might result in a substantial lessening of competition, particularly in the market for current accounts,\" he added. He also cited concerns about the provision of banking to small business, in which Abbey National is an aspiring player. </p> <p>Peter Ellwood, the chief executive of Lloyds, said: \"We feel we've got a very good chance of getting clearance.\" He and his advisors will set out to prove to the watchdog that competition is rife in the current account market, with \"three dozen players\" fighting for business and citing Abbey's \"de minimus\" share of the small banking market. </p> <p>Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey, however, said: \"It is a very strong referral. The government seems to want competition outside the big four\". The big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and NatWest - between them have a 70% share of the current account market. </p> <p>While the banks now begin arguing their respective cases to the competition authorities, shareholders appeared resigned to sit out the uncertainty of the coming four months. One shareholder in all three banks said: \"The whole thing should be on a level playing field. I don't think there's any grounds for Bank of Scotland and Abbey National to push forward.\" </p> <p>Analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton, an investment bank, said: \"We believe the referral was driven as much by political considerations as by competition concerns. In the lead-up to a general election, it is unlikely that the Labour party would wish to be seen to be sanctioning a deal that will ultimately lead to branch closures and staff losses, both politically sensitive issues at the moment. Ultimately, we believe that the deal will be allowed through\". </p> <p><strong>The main players in a long running battle</strong></p> <p><strong> Ian Harley</strong><br>Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey National, allowed himself a small smile at 11am yesterday when the statement containing the news the unwelcome advances of Lloyds TSB faced a four month delay hit the stock exchange. </p> <p>The statement contained the information many think would have been music to his ears. He was in fighting form last night, insisting it would be difficult for Lloyds TSB to pass the competition hurdles. </p> <p>Accused by some in the City of trying to hide behind the referral, Mr Harley now has some breathing space to try to convince shareholders that Lloyds TSB should be given short shrift if its attempted takeover is eventually cleared. Mr Harley has received a mixed reception among City investors and before the Bank of Scotland talks were leaked he found himself defending calls from his shareholders for a change at the top. </p> <p>Some think he faces an uphill struggle in winning the support of investors, who may prefer the lure of Lloyds TSB's cash than a nil-premium merger with Bank of Scotland. He disputed Lloyds claims of shareholder support, saying, \"people will tell you what you want to hear\". </p> <p><strong> Peter Ellwood</strong><br>The chief executive of Lloyds TSB remained upbeat yesterday despite facing a delay of at least four months in his \u00a319bn attempt to take over Abbey National. </p> <p>A career banker, Mr Ellwood has lived in the shadow of outgoing chairman Sir Brian Pitman, and is determined to use a takeover of Abbey to give Lloyds TSB enough bulk to complete a major deal in Europe in the months ahead. </p> <p>He insists the deal will eventually be cleared, and while the City appeared to have some sympathy with him yesterday, the referral of the bid is the last thing he needed. </p> <p>Armed with arguments as to why the banking environment is highly competitive, Mr Ellwood is at the helm of the bank just as its star status with investors is starting to appear slightly tarnished. The publication of annual results last week did not match the usual hallowed status granted the bank, which in the past five years has earned a reputation for takeovers of TSB, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Scottish Widows. </p> <p>Lloyds abandoned its pledge to cut costs and analysts interpreted that as a demonstration of why Mr Ellwood needed Abbey. </p> <p><strong> Peter Burt</strong><br>Peter Burt, the blunt chief executive of Bank of Scotland, received a standing ovation when he launched his audacious, yet ultimately ill-fated, bid for NatWest over a year ago. </p> <p>Now the 25-year veteran of the Edinburgh-based bank faces the danger of being left at the altar twice. While he is respected for his management of the bank, City sources believe he will be reluctant to rush into an Abbey deal while there is any chance Lloyds TSB could be successful. </p> <p>Some in the City even believe that Mr Burt and his board have a latent suspicion of Barclays, and privately wonder whether the charismatic Matt Barrett might be tempted to shift his attentions north of the border once the competition authorities' views are clear. Yet Mr Burt and his camp of followers are also convinced that Lloyds TSB's advances on Abbey National do raise serious concerns for the competition authorities. </p> <p>While his talks with Abbey National got off to a frosty start, relations are now said to be more amicable. He dined with his counterpart at Abbey National only last week. A last supper, perhaps?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lloyds TSB last night remained resolute in its determination to take over Abbey National even though its \u00a319bn bid faces a four-month delay because of an investigation by the competition authorities. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, finally referred the controversial bid to the competition commission and the hostility between Abbey and Lloyds escalated. Abbey also indicated that it was prepared to press ahead to try to consummate its merger with Bank of Scotland, even while the investigation into the Lloyds deal - which would involve 9,000 job cuts and 600 branch closures - was continuing. BoS described the situation as \"dynamic\". Shares in all three banks fell on the news, which had the effect of reducing the value of Lloyds's offer to \u00a317bn, or just above \u00a312 for each Abbey National share; the price fell 36p to \u00a311.03 yesterday. Mark Pain, finance director of Abbey, which is refusing to succumb to Lloyds TSB's advances, likened his predator to the troubled retailer Marks &amp; Spencer. \"They've got a chairman [Sir Brian Pitman] who stayed too long and chief executive [Peter Ellwood] who's no good for the job,\" he said. Mr Byers gave the competition commission until June 12 to submit its report on Lloyds's bid, which he said had raised concern at the office of fair trading about current accounts and small business. Even though Mr Byers insisted he had followed the advice given to him, this failed to prevent criticism by City analysts that political pressures were playing a role so close to an election. This was heightened by the fact that Mr Byers had left the publication of his decision until the last moment. The City believes that Lloyds' ambitions to take over Abbey National are in effect on hold until the verdict of the competition commission. \"The proposed merger would lead to the elimination from the market of one of the the most significant branch based competitors to the UK's four largest banks,\" Mr Byers said. \"This might result in a substantial lessening of competition, particularly in the market for current accounts,\" he added. He also cited concerns about the provision of banking to small business, in which Abbey National is an aspiring player. Peter Ellwood, the chief executive of Lloyds, said: \"We feel we've got a very good chance of getting clearance.\" He and his advisors will set out to prove to the watchdog that competition is rife in the current account market, with \"three dozen players\" fighting for business and citing Abbey's \"de minimus\" share of the small banking market. Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey, however, said: \"It is a very strong referral. The government seems to want competition outside the big four\". The big four - Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and NatWest - between them have a 70% share of the current account market. While the banks now begin arguing their respective cases to the competition authorities, shareholders appeared resigned to sit out the uncertainty of the coming four months. One shareholder in all three banks said: \"The whole thing should be on a level playing field. I don't think there's any grounds for Bank of Scotland and Abbey National to push forward.\" Analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton, an investment bank, said: \"We believe the referral was driven as much by political considerations as by competition concerns. In the lead-up to a general election, it is unlikely that the Labour party would wish to be seen to be sanctioning a deal that will ultimately lead to branch closures and staff losses, both politically sensitive issues at the moment. Ultimately, we believe that the deal will be allowed through\". The main players in a long running battle Ian Harley Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey National, allowed himself a small smile at 11am yesterday when the statement containing the news the unwelcome advances of Lloyds TSB faced a four month delay hit the stock exchange. The statement contained the information many think would have been music to his ears. He was in fighting form last night, insisting it would be difficult for Lloyds TSB to pass the competition hurdles. Accused by some in the City of trying to hide behind the referral, Mr Harley now has some breathing space to try to convince shareholders that Lloyds TSB should be given short shrift if its attempted takeover is eventually cleared. Mr Harley has received a mixed reception among City investors and before the Bank of Scotland talks were leaked he found himself defending calls from his shareholders for a change at the top. Some think he faces an uphill struggle in winning the support of investors, who may prefer the lure of Lloyds TSB's cash than a nil-premium merger with Bank of Scotland. He disputed Lloyds claims of shareholder support, saying, \"people will tell you what you want to hear\". Peter Ellwood The chief executive of Lloyds TSB remained upbeat yesterday despite facing a delay of at least four months in his \u00a319bn attempt to take over Abbey National. A career banker, Mr Ellwood has lived in the shadow of outgoing chairman Sir Brian Pitman, and is determined to use a takeover of Abbey to give Lloyds TSB enough bulk to complete a major deal in Europe in the months ahead. He insists the deal will eventually be cleared, and while the City appeared to have some sympathy with him yesterday, the referral of the bid is the last thing he needed. Armed with arguments as to why the banking environment is highly competitive, Mr Ellwood is at the helm of the bank just as its star status with investors is starting to appear slightly tarnished. The publication of annual results last week did not match the usual hallowed status granted the bank, which in the past five years has earned a reputation for takeovers of TSB, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Scottish Widows. Lloyds abandoned its pledge to cut costs and analysts interpreted that as a demonstration of why Mr Ellwood needed Abbey. Peter Burt Peter Burt, the blunt chief executive of Bank of Scotland, received a standing ovation when he launched his audacious, yet ultimately ill-fated, bid for NatWest over a year ago. Now the 25-year veteran of the Edinburgh-based bank faces the danger of being left at the altar twice. While he is respected for his management of the bank, City sources believe he will be reluctant to rush into an Abbey deal while there is any chance Lloyds TSB could be successful. Some in the City even believe that Mr Burt and his board have a latent suspicion of Barclays, and privately wonder whether the charismatic Matt Barrett might be tempted to shift his attentions north of the border once the competition authorities' views are clear. Yet Mr Burt and his camp of followers are also convinced that Lloyds TSB's advances on Abbey National do raise serious concerns for the competition authorities. While his talks with Abbey National got off to a frosty start, relations are now said to be more amicable. He dined with his counterpart at Abbey National only last week. A last supper, perhaps?",

There is a special facility allowing you to withdraw 5% of the original investment for a period of up to 20 years without incurring any immediate tax liability.

The money raised from the sale can either be used to provide additional income or invested to fund long-term care insurance and/or finance an inheritance tax saving plan. </p> <p>Charges on special inheritance tax schemes can be very high, especially if they use offshore investments. However, if the sums involved are reasonably large, you can usually persuade financial advisers to rebate some of the large commissions they receive or to work on an agreed-fee only basis, with a full rebate of all commission.

And the size of the charges can sometimes seem insignificant when compared with the savings made on inheritance tax. It may be simpler and cheaper just to give money away to your beneficiaries. The problem with doing this is that you have to wait four to seven years before there is any relief from inheritance tax, and you would lose control of the capital. Using a trust-based inheritance tax scheme enables you to retain some control, provide yourself with some benefits and an instant reduction in tax liability. Leading players amongst the insurance companies providing these instant discount schemes include Axa Sun Life, Canada Life (formerly Albany Life), Scottish Amicable, Scottish Mutual and Skandia. They all have different quirks and charging structures, so it is sensible to consult an independent financial adviser to help you find the scheme that suits your particular requirements best.",
