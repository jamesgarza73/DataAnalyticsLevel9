Henry may be partnered up front by Graham Barrett, an 18-year-old Dubliner who before he came off the bench for the last seven minutes against Sunderland had had precisely 60 seconds experience of first-team football. </p> <p>\"Barrett has a good chance of playing if we don't buy anybody in the meantime,\" said Wenger. \"But I can't exclude a new signing at the moment and if there is an opportunity I will take it.

But whether or not Wenger buys another forward this week, he will go to Old Trafford knowing his squad is starting to acquire sufficient depth to challenge United on their own terms. </p> <p>This victory was distinguished by two slickly taken goals from Henry and a wonderful piece of opportunism from Suker, who also scored with a tap-in. Equally significant was the way Arsenal's defence managed, in Adams's absence, to cope with the prolific partnership of Kevin Phillips and Niall Quinn. </p> <p>Oleg Luzhny, normally a right-back, played on the left side of Martin Keown with no hope of beating Quinn in the air. Yet the Ukrainian still managed to reduce Quinn's effectiveness through persistent hustling which cut off an essential source of opportunities for Phillips. </p> <p>Overall, the main reason why Sunderland were overrun before half-time and kept at arm's length thereafter lay in the continuing excellence of Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit in midfield.

As it was, Henry put Arsenal ahead on three minutes when a ball from Fredrik Ljungberg enabled him to turn inside Steve Bould and drive in a shot off Sorensen's knee. </p> <p>Bould, Quinn and Stefan Schwarz are Highbury old boys; by half-time they must have felt even older. In the 27th minute Suker gathered a square pass from Henry to the left of goal, spotted Sorensen a fraction off his line and proceeded to loop a gloriously impudent shot over the 6ft 4in Dane and into the net via the far post. </p> <p>\"A Suker goal,\" was how Wenger described it.

We scored four goals, hit the woodwork four times and missed a penalty, which isn't a bad return.\" </p> <p>Newcastle were in for the kill straightaway against a side which hoisted the white flag before most of their players had even muddied their knees. After two minutes Nolberto Solano surged down the right and crossed for Alan Shearer to head against the crossbar. The rebound fell kindly for Ferguson and from six yards the rest was a formality. </p> <p>Within another 90 seconds Newcastle's accountants were already writing out the cheques for the players' win bonuses. This time a rejuvenated Ferguson displayed his prowess on the ground with the sweetest of right-foot drives to ram a loose ball low and hard beyond Paul Jones. </p> <p>Only three minutes gone and Southampton, those notoriously bad travellers, were already facing a damage-limitation exercise. But Newcastle had no intention of extending any form of hospitality. </p> <p>Robson did not need reminding his team had surrendered a two-goal advantage in their previous Premiership game against West Ham. Solano ensured there would be no repeatwith the third goal following a 17th-minute move that epitomised Newcastle's approach play. </p> <p>Ferguson was the instigator with an exquisite flick that sent Kieron Dyer scampering clear. His one-two with Shearer was simplicity itself and the Peruvian was clinical in his execution. </p> <p>When Richard Dryden inadvertently diverted Dyer's low delivery beyond his own goalkeeper, thoughts were turning to the 8-0 rout of Sheffield Wednesday in September. </p> <p>Newcastle even had the luxury of a wasted penalty after Neale Barry spotted a sly tug by Dean Richards on Ferguson that even the recipient did not appear to have noticed. Shearer's spot-kick crashed off the underside of the bar and was scrambled to safety, although TV as revealed it had landed marginally over the line. </p> <p>With victory a foregone conclusion, Newcastle were entitled to ease off slightly in the second half and Southampton avoided further punishment until seven minutes before the final whistle when Nikos Dabizas's shot took a fortuitous deflection off Gary Monk. </p> <p>By then the travelling fans had turned on Southampton's manager Dave Jones. Their escapology over two decades has gained near-legendary status, and another wade through quicksand beckons.</p>",

Was this really the same Newcastle side that had shipped four goals at the Dell a few months ago? \"I reminded them about that hammering and they responded magnificently,\" Robson said afterwards. \"I wanted them to take the initiative and we couldn't have done more in the first half. We scored four goals, hit the woodwork four times and missed a penalty, which isn't a bad return.\" Newcastle were in for the kill straightaway against a side which hoisted the white flag before most of their players had even muddied their knees. After two minutes Nolberto Solano surged down the right and crossed for Alan Shearer to head against the crossbar. The rebound fell kindly for Ferguson and from six yards the rest was a formality. Within another 90 seconds Newcastle's accountants were already writing out the cheques for the players' win bonuses. This time a rejuvenated Ferguson displayed his prowess on the ground with the sweetest of right-foot drives to ram a loose ball low and hard beyond Paul Jones. Only three minutes gone and Southampton, those notoriously bad travellers, were already facing a damage-limitation exercise. But Newcastle had no intention of extending any form of hospitality. Robson did not need reminding his team had surrendered a two-goal advantage in their previous Premiership game against West Ham. Solano ensured there would be no repeatwith the third goal following a 17th-minute move that epitomised Newcastle's approach play. Ferguson was the instigator with an exquisite flick that sent Kieron Dyer scampering clear. His one-two with Shearer was simplicity itself and the Peruvian was clinical in his execution. When Richard Dryden inadvertently diverted Dyer's low delivery beyond his own goalkeeper, thoughts were turning to the 8-0 rout of Sheffield Wednesday in September. Newcastle even had the luxury of a wasted penalty after Neale Barry spotted a sly tug by Dean Richards on Ferguson that even the recipient did not appear to have noticed. Shearer's spot-kick crashed off the underside of the bar and was scrambled to safety, although TV as revealed it had landed marginally over the line. With victory a foregone conclusion, Newcastle were entitled to ease off slightly in the second half and Southampton avoided further punishment until seven minutes before the final whistle when Nikos Dabizas's shot took a fortuitous deflection off Gary Monk. By then the travelling fans had turned on Southampton's manager Dave Jones. Their escapology over two decades has gained near-legendary status, and another wade through quicksand beckons.",

      "bodyText": "Chelsea's managing director Colin Hutchinson believes the transformation of some lower league sides into nursery clubs for Premiership teams would be \"the saviour the game is looking for\". Hutchinson says top-flight teams should develop close links with smaller domestic clubs rather than looking abroad for similar tie-ups. He insists that not only would young players' development be improved but that lower clubs could also benefit financially as well as tap into the technical, coaching and medical expertise of rich clubs. Hutchinson, writing in Chelsea's match programme on Saturday, declared the Football Association's \"blueprint for the 21st century... has one major flaw.\" He went on: \"Academies, Premier League under-17 and under-19 leagues and a Premier League reserves competition are all part of the development process, but the system is crying out for nursery clubs to 'fast-track' bright youngsters. Nothing helps a young professional more than playing in front of crowds.\" Hutchinson cited how David Beckham was helped by a loan to Preston and Michael Duberry by a brief spell at Bournemouth. He added: \"Playing for a league club is far better experience than reserve games.\" Liverpool have rejected a loan move to Rosenborg of Norway for Brad Friedel, their out-of-favour goalkeeper.",

The bond between Robson and his chairman Steve Gibson is close and the man who has financed Middlesbrough's image overhaul did not make his millions by succumbing to the demands of others. </p> <p>That said, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Robson's pride will intervene should the downward spiral that has incorporated cup defeats against Wrexham and Tranmere Rovers continue. </p> <p>\"If you are underachieving you have to expect criticism in this job. It hurts but the way I see it is: where were Middlesbrough when I arrived here? We are still going forward and there is time to put it right,\" Robson said. </p> <p>\"We finished ninth last season and the aim is to improve on that.

Not least, in the case of Esteban Fuertes, a valid passport. </p> <p>From the moment Christie headed Jim Smith's team into an eighth-minute lead, the home fans' anger and resentment rained down on Robson from every corner of the stadium before half-time's breathing space arrived. </p> <p>Within two minutes of the restart, though, Deon Burton scored to crank up the decibel levels. The crescendo arrived on the hour when Schwarzer blasted an attempted clearance straight at Christie, presenting the debutant with his second goal and prompting a stampede for the exit gates. </p> <p>Those who abandoned ship missed Hamilton Ricard squandering a penalty and a fine strike from the substitute Andy Campbell, but this was rendered meaningless when Craig Burley provided Derby's fourth in stoppage time. </p> <p>\"I can understand the fans' frustration,\" said Boro's captain Paul Ince. \"Sometimes there can be a fear factor in times like this and people tend to hide. The team performance was diabolical as well and the fans are entitled to voice their opinions. But I feel for Robbo. He is one of the reasons I came here and it hurts me, probably more than anyone, when I hear the supporters saying he should go.\" </p> <p>Christie is from Cambridgeshire and so inevitably he is a Manchester United supporter. He even admitted to having a poster of Captain Marvel on his bedroom wall. But that was the old, invincible Robson.</p>",

That said, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Robson's pride will intervene should the downward spiral that has incorporated cup defeats against Wrexham and Tranmere Rovers continue. \"If you are underachieving you have to expect criticism in this job. It hurts but the way I see it is: where were Middlesbrough when I arrived here? We are still going forward and there is time to put it right,\" Robson said. \"We finished ninth last season and the aim is to improve on that. If we don't, the supporters can judge me then.\" That the humiliation was inspired by an unknown 20-year-old merely deepened Robson's blushes. Malcolm Christie was plucked from Nuneaton Borough for \u00a375,000, but two goals in an impressive debut suggests he possesses qualities lacking in several of his Derby predecessors. Not least, in the case of Esteban Fuertes, a valid passport. From the moment Christie headed Jim Smith's team into an eighth-minute lead, the home fans' anger and resentment rained down on Robson from every corner of the stadium before half-time's breathing space arrived. Within two minutes of the restart, though, Deon Burton scored to crank up the decibel levels. The crescendo arrived on the hour when Schwarzer blasted an attempted clearance straight at Christie, presenting the debutant with his second goal and prompting a stampede for the exit gates. Those who abandoned ship missed Hamilton Ricard squandering a penalty and a fine strike from the substitute Andy Campbell, but this was rendered meaningless when Craig Burley provided Derby's fourth in stoppage time. \"I can understand the fans' frustration,\" said Boro's captain Paul Ince. \"Sometimes there can be a fear factor in times like this and people tend to hide. The team performance was diabolical as well and the fans are entitled to voice their opinions. But I feel for Robbo. He is one of the reasons I came here and it hurts me, probably more than anyone, when I hear the supporters saying he should go.\" Christie is from Cambridgeshire and so inevitably he is a Manchester United supporter. He even admitted to having a poster of Captain Marvel on his bedroom wall. But that was the old, invincible Robson.",

Micky Stockwell opened the scoring with a low drive from 12 yards and when Richard Naylor beat Frank Talia with a deft lob in the 37th minute it was game over. Naylor wrapped it up with a late header from Jamie Clapham's cross, but David Johnson alone should have scored four after the interval. \"You could see the difference between the two teams; they haven't got a weakness,\" said Jimmy Quinn, the Swindon player-manager, who has not been helped by the apathy that set in among the fans during Steve McMahon's tenure. This season he has been forced to sell four regular first-team players and sack 15 backroom staff. Gates are at a 13-year low, the club are a reported \u00a34m in debt and struggling to attract match-ball sponsors, but Quinn is hoping for the go-ahead to rebuild; nine of the expensive 28-man squad he inherited are out of contract in the summer. For Ipswich, things could not be more different. They have \"significant funds\" to help \"go the extra mile\", according to the chairman David Sheepshanks, and even had the chance to give Gary Croft a run-out five days after his release from prison, where he watched the previous Saturday's results on television. The defender was given a standing ovation when he came on with an electronic tag strapped above his left ankle. \"It's the sports version: waterproof and shockproof,\" he said. \"I've missed the big-game atmosphere. It's something you love as a footballer and it was great to be part of it again,\" he added before heading for home smartly, before the 7pm curfew which is a condition of his parole.",

This is the fourth time that since the Black Death in the 14th century, she says, that overproduction has forced farmers to find alternative sources of income. Agricultural prosperity has been cyclical - depression lasted 150 years from the 1300s, and there were further dips for a century after the mid-17th century and for about 70 years from 1870 to 1940. The present crisis could last another 40 years. \"People only look at (non-food crops) in times of trouble. It is much more straightforward to grow mainstream crops when farming is prosperous. But these things have to be taken seriously if we are not to lose a whole generation of farmers.\"",

The poll reinforces concerns that rapid house price inflation in the past year, which saw property prices in greater London rise by almost 30%, means young professionals are increasingly unable to afford a mortgage. The Mori survey for the National Housing Federation and the Chartered Institute of Housing marks the launch of a national campaign - Our Homes, Our Future - to warn the government that Britain faces a housing crisis. The poll of 2,000 people found that in the south-east 55% of people doubted that the next generation could afford a home. Even in three northern regions, where house prices rose by just over 5% last year, a large minority (45%) have the same view. \"The housing market is creating winners but also losers,\" said Jim Coulter, chief executive of the Housing Federation, which mainly represents publicly funded housing associations - the only agencies that are currently building lower-cost homes for rent. \"The winners are the ones lucky enough to own a home soaring in value, while the unlucky ones cannot afford a home - forcing employers to increase wages to cover housing costs. It is not surprising people are losing confidence.\" The latest survey follows research by the federation which shows that people on average incomes working in London are finding it increasingly difficult to afford rented accommodation, let alone qualify for a mortgage. The average weekly rent for a two-bedroom flat in London is \u00a3274 - more than four times the \u00a365 a week average rent for a similar property in a city such as Leeds. Calculating that the average price paid for a property by first time buyers is about \u00a3100,000, the federation says key workers are being frozen out of the market. A nurse with five years experience, and earning \u00a318,500 a year, would only qualify for a maximum mortgage of around \u00a353,000, says the federation, while a teacher with the same length of service would earn almost \u00a323,000. This would put a mortgage of \u00a365,000 within reach. Londoners earned, on average, 12% more than people in the rest of the UK, but housing costs - rents and mortgages - are \"several times higher\", says the federation. Away from the region, the federation says rural areas are facing acute shortages of low-cost homes - partly because more than 100,000 council houses have been sold off under the \"right to buy\" scheme. The government's countryside agency calculates that more than 62,000 new homes are needed to meet demand. David Butler, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, which represents council housing managers, said: \"Clearly the market cannot provide enough decent homes at prices people can afford.

There are some beach huts, a shop and a couple of bars and basic restaurants.

According to the latest survey, at the end of last year, 24% of the UK's population now regularly uses the internet; there are 11.2m users over the age of 15. That figure increased by 1.2m - the equivalent of the entire population of Birmingham - between May and November.</p> <p>In 1995, when the net in the UK was the property of a small number of academics and geeks, there were only 19m users in the world. Now that global audience is over 200m. Research group IDC believes there will soon be more internet users than there are US citizens. E-commerce (the term only started to appear in 1997) was worth \u00a32bn in the UK last year, according to Continental Research - a multi-billion-pound business that has appeared from nowhere in three years.</p> <p>But these bald facts tell only part of the story of the net's impact on the UK. Statistics alone cannot convey, for example, how the simple concept of email has changed the way we communicate. Five years ago, telling someone your email address was about as easy and useful as dictating your life story in Sanskrit. Now it is more convenient and simple than swapping phone numbers.</p> <p>The @ sign, which languished unloved on the keyboard for decades, has become an icon of our times. Email has dissolved the barriers of time and space that traditionally restricted communication. It works whether we are communicating with someone on the other side of the office or the other side of the planet. My emails from a Thailand cybercafe show one side of this: the phone, the fax and airmail are clumsy and expensive in comparison. It is little wonder that Hotmail has become as much a part of a traveller's life as Lonely Planet guidebooks and friendship bracelets.</p> <p>Back in the office, email has created an entirely new culture of communication. It combines the permanence of a memo with the immediacy of a phone call and some of the intimacy of a face-to-face meeting. We use it to confront people we daren't confront in person. We use it to bitch about colleagues at the same time as talking or sitting opposite them. Entire business school dissertations could be written on the politics of using the \"cc\" and \"bcc\" functions (bcc allows you to send a copy of a mail to someone without revealing so to the principal recipient - a particularly devious tool).

Some industries, such as stockbrokers, travel agents, car dealers, music and book retailers and newspapers, find themselves facing elimination as the net threatens more and more. Boardrooms that were once full of certainty and arrogance have found themselves dithering as the internet has grown. I recently met with an old family friend, the head of a major retail chain with 30 years' experience and an impressive track record. He confessed that the net had him baffled. He was doing everything right - all the research, all the analysis, all the usual steps that had got him where he was, yet still he couldn't find a way to make it work. He eventually admitted that his sole consolation was that he would soon be retiring and be able to pass the problem on to his successor.</p> <p>Even those who have long been rulers of their domain now find themselves treading uncertainly. When, last year, the Halifax had a security lapse on its site, it immediately sent out an apology email to all its online subscribers.

E-commerce is set to change all scales of transactions, from the way a car manufacturer buys components to the way we buy our groceries. While many of the companies currently hoping to be the next Amazon will ultimately disappear - as might Amazon itself - the simple premise that we can now shop online (whether through the PC, TV or mobile phone) is with us to stay. Online transactions simply make too much economic sense to be ignored. They eliminate middlemen and cost less, which is great for those at either end, but miserable for those in the middle, which is why the likes of travel agents and stockbrokers have so much to fear.</p> <p>The internet economy has also brought with it changes in working culture. While the government has introduced a working time directive and a maximum 48-hour working week, internet start-ups are desperate for a 48-hour working day in order to fulfill their ambitions. Anyone with the right ideas and abilities can start up their own company - not simply middle managers who have served their time. Share options too are now deemed a right, not a privilege.</p> <p>We have also learned to network - in London, there are networking events for the internet industry pretty much every night of the week where wannabe cyber-millionaires swap business cards, quaff white wine and lager and ooze unbearable confidence. It is a most un-British way of doing things. And in our most important lesson from the US, we have seen the rise of the internet stock - Freeserve, QXL and the 365 Corporation have proved that we are just as capable as our American cousins of valuing a company that has never made a profit at hundreds of millions of pounds. Despite all this, it is not true that anyone can be a millionaire through the net. But anyone can put up a website, and this has been the third great change caused by the net.

      "body": "<p>Remember when the usual answer to 'How are you?' was 'Fine'? Now, the reply most often given, by everybody, is 'Frantic'. If there is one experience we all share at the beginning of the 21st century, it's the desperate feeling that there's never enough time. We schedule time in ever smaller chunks - 10-minute slots for meetings, five-minute slots for cooking an evening meal (just check out the number of Meals In Minutes cookbooks on any bookshelf), one-minute slots for reading a child a bedtime story\u0080 Multi-tasking, originally a way to make more efficient use of time, has become another pressure. Doing just one thing at a time is a positive indulgence, so we work on the train, feed the baby while we talk on the phone, have a sandwich at our desks, and do sit-ups in front of the TV.</p> <p>Dr Donald Wetmore is a time-management guru at Connecticut's Productivity Institute. It's a single decade, he says, that has taken us from 'fine' to 'frantic'. 'Between 1982 and 1989 I taught 600 people time-management courses at the Institute. From 1989 to now, that number rose to 30,000.' And it's no good hoping the next 10 years will be easier as technology finally frees us all from our frenzied existence. 'Innovations don't eradicate previous methods. They simply add other layers of responsibility to our lives.'</p> <p>How much more can we take? Is it possible to keep up in a speeded-up world without giving up our private lives and personal passions? Actually, yes. Most time-management advice tends to be mechanistic - little tips to help you save half an hour here or there. They can be useful, but they won't do any good if you don't start by examining your own attitude to time, and your own core values. In his book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, James Gleick coins the term 'hurry sickness' to describe this modern malaise. He points out that although we may be desperate to step off the treadmill, it's also true that we thrive on the speed and adrenaline of modern life. Conditioned to expect it as given, we crave more, but at a price. 'A minute!', barks stressed-out Everyman Homer Simpson at his tub of popcorn. 'Isn't there anything faster than a microwave?!' If you're really ready to begin taking your time back, the strategies below can help. Many of the principles governing effective life balancing and time management are commonsense. Yet how many of these simple axioms do you currently apply to your own time? The answers lie in being honest and proactive, rather than reactive, to the way we see and spend our time. And underpinning them all is the message that your time, like your life, is what you make it.</p> <p><b>General</b> <br> Dr Wetmore recommends that you start with the basics. 'Take a few minutes to plan your day in advance. Very few people actually do this, although they may make long lists of all the things they want to get done, it's not the same as a realistic plan of what you will do, and how and when you will do it. This can dramatically improve your effectiveness and cut down on wasted effort.' Look at your position at work as just that - a position, not a 'job'. A position from which you can attend to your needs on three levels - social, financial and professional. Keep interruptions to a minimum. 'My phones don't take calls, they take messages,' says John Naisbitt, author of High Tech/High Touch. 'How can I find time for my own agenda when everyone's trying to make me a part of theirs?' One of the best and most powerful ways to take back time and reduce your stress levels, according to Dr Wetmore, is to maintain good relationships with others: 'an often overlooked but uniquely effective method of minimising stress, staying happy and reducing the amount of time wasted on counter-productivity'.</p> <p><b>Balance/Technology</b><br> Technology was supposed to free us from time-famine, cutting our workloads, making our lives more flexible, and giving us back time and space to spend on ourselves. Often, it's had the opposite effect. According to Dr Wetmore, 'Five years ago it was assumed that e-mail would make postal communication redundant. Last year, the highest number of e-mails ever were sent, and the highest number of letters too.' Learning to balance the pros and cons of the digital age is vital for achieving control over our own time. John Naisbitt, Nana Naisbitt and Douglas Philips, authors of High Tech/High Touch, offer their advice.</p> <p><b>Don't dismiss technology</b> - or take it for granted. It's important to recognise that technology isn't just simply there for good or ill - technology, in this particular instance, meaning consumer technology. It's in no way neutral. You have to appreciate and address the fact that you have a relationship with it. Examine that relationship thoroughly and ask yourself what you really need from technology and what you can do without. Very few people do this. Technophobes pass over its many potential benefits and the rest are seduced on to the endless slope of one upgrade to another without ever really thinking why.</p> <p><b>Identify the consequences of technology.</b> What you are being sold when you buy into technology is a promise that things will be easier, faster and better. We often look at technology as a toy, but behind its promise lie unspoken consequences. Not least of these is the way technology shapes our sense of time. The speed of response it now requires from us has contributed to the desire for instant gratification.</p> <p><b>We need to lose both our awe and our fear of technology, and see it with clear eyes.</b> With a conscious approach, its true benefits and deficits become apparent. It's possible to estimate how we might apply it constructively in the future. And if you can see where it's going, it gives you much less to feel anxious about in the present.</p> <p><b>Time at Work <br> Recognise your personal energy levels.</b> According to Jaqueline Atkinson, author of Better Time Management, time management and energy management are essentially the same thing. If you are tired and stressed, stop. 'Identify your personal energy levels. Be realistic about how much you can do. Resolve to work only as long as that permits. You may have to ask yourself, do I want this job, or my health and family?'</p> <p><b>Be realistic in defining yourself.</b> Atkinson likes to tell what she calls 'a true, cautionary tale. A small business owner's marriage and health were dissolving. His bank manager suggested he pay himself less and hire an employee. He refused, because he defined himself by what he earned. If you realise work is most important to you, acknowledge it, at least to yourself, if not necessarily to your family or partner.'</p> <p><b>Be realistic in your expectations.</b> Most psychological pressures in the workplace come from unmet expectations, says Dr Wetmore. 'Many small disappointments grow into one big one. Lowering your expectations - to real rather than low levels - allows you to focus much better on the reality of what you can achieve.'</p> <p><b>Aim for an appreciation of working processes, not just results.</b> '\"You are what you achieve\" isn't necessarily true but still hangs over from the 1980s when it was paramount,' says Atkinson. 'Don't ask yourself relentlessly \"what have I achieved?\", but \"did I enjoy the process of doing it? Did I learn from it?\" This alleviates guilt and anxiety over work. A positive approach to processes produces a higher standard of work, more quickly than focusing only on the end result.'</p> <p><b>Tailor the quality of your work to the time available.</b> 'Perfectionists balk when told, \"make it good enough,\"' admits Jaqueline Atkinson. 'Yet PC printers offer \"fast\", \"good\" and \"best\" options. Why? Because excellence is not a prerequisite for all tasks. Realise that good enough is still good, increasing productivity and free time for other tasks.'</p> <p><b>Time at home <br> Soporific pursuits can bring you down still further.</b> Slumping in front of the TV (or doing similar pursuits that aren't really satisfying) creates lots of 'dead time' and usually ends up making you feel more tired - and just as time-pressured - as before. Is it such a good idea for a stressed, tired person to subject themselves to the evening news? Many time-management experts identify 'vegging out' with the TV as a major cause of lost time, fatigue and dissatisfaction. Atkinson recommends that you simply use a VCR and set aside specific time to watch what you really want in a block. Or put the TV away in a cupboard, so you have to make a conscious effort to get it out.</p> <p><b>Satisfy your inner needs </b> It's easy to let the thoughts and effects of work overbalance into home time. At the end of the day take an opportunity to buy back time for yourself, says Atkinson. 'It's a shame that the term \"hobby\" has such nerdy connotations. It's extremely unlikely that work gives you what you need to satisfy your innermost requirements, so having an occupation that does is a prerequisite for achieving that balance. When people ask me why I enjoy patchwork I tell them simply, \"because of the juxtaposition of colours\".'</p> <p><b>Sorry, you still have to vacuum the carpet.</b> Wilfully managing your time allows you to do a great deal more with your life. Sadly, this doesn't translate into no longer having to do the housework. 'We all have routine tasks and responsibilities to attend to,' says Atkinson. 'But if you've accepted that pre-planning is essential, it's easier for you to recognise the optimum time for attending to the nuts and bolts of home life. Understand that it's the accumulation of small daily victories that enhance our sense of self-worth. Be self-disciplined, do the work at a pre- governed time, and you'll find that beating the housework counts among them.'</p> <p><b>Time alone/relaxation </b><br> For so many of us, time alone is either a luxury we can't afford or something we fear and try to avoid at all costs. Either way, we almost never get time completely to ourselves. And yet it can be an enormously powerful way to get back a feeling of owning your own time, destressing and balancing the pace of your life.</p> <p>'There's no set requirement or method for spending rewarding time alone,' Atkinson says. 'A person's basic need for time alone is based on the individual's need for stimulation. The trick is to relax properly, not necessarily just do nothing.'</p> <p>You can do so at any time with meditative and relaxation techniques that can be put to good use in just a few moments, even if you don't have the time or inclination to keep your own company. Psychotherapist Sue Vaughan includes this Yogic breathing exercise for 'when your head feels muzzy and your nerves are jangled' in her book Finding the Stillness Within in a Busy World. Try it at your desk. Ignore any sideways glances.</p> <p><b>Alternate Nostril Breathing Exercise.</b> Sit with your back straight, with your neck and head in a straight line. Shoulders slightly back but relaxed. Breathe steadily and easily. Try to get the incoming and outgoing breaths the same length. Observe the natural rhythm of your breathing. Now press the left nostril closed with your thumb and inhale through your right nostril. Remove your thumb and close your right nostril with your forefinger and exhale through your left nostril. Without changing fingers, inhale through your left nostril. Change fingers, exhale through the right. Inhale through the right and exhale through the left, and so on.</p> <p><b>Feel the fear and do it anyway</b><br> What if you recognise the need for personal space and to relax but are uncomfortable with the idea of being alone? The fear of loneliness manifests itself in many ways. According to Vaughan, 'There is a constructive and destructive side to the fear of loneliness. Unexpressed, it can flow into behaviours designed to avoid rather than release it. The constructive side to loneliness can be that it serves as the impetus and motivation to look within for your inner resources; to find the stillness in the whirlpool.' It can be overcome, she says, by making friends with yourself. Stop criticising and belittling yourself. Treat yourself kindly and politely as you would another, and recognise that flaws of character and making mistakes are normal. 'The lesson that loneliness can teach us is that when it occurs in our lives, we have the opportunity of looking within. It is then that we can discover all the resources we need. We can become our own person, aware of the strength as well as the peace and serenity we hold within ourselves.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Remember when the usual answer to 'How are you?' was 'Fine'? Now, the reply most often given, by everybody, is 'Frantic'. If there is one experience we all share at the beginning of the 21st century, it's the desperate feeling that there's never enough time. We schedule time in ever smaller chunks - 10-minute slots for meetings, five-minute slots for cooking an evening meal (just check out the number of Meals In Minutes cookbooks on any bookshelf), one-minute slots for reading a child a bedtime story\u0080 Multi-tasking, originally a way to make more efficient use of time, has become another pressure. Doing just one thing at a time is a positive indulgence, so we work on the train, feed the baby while we talk on the phone, have a sandwich at our desks, and do sit-ups in front of the TV. Dr Donald Wetmore is a time-management guru at Connecticut's Productivity Institute. It's a single decade, he says, that has taken us from 'fine' to 'frantic'. 'Between 1982 and 1989 I taught 600 people time-management courses at the Institute. From 1989 to now, that number rose to 30,000.' And it's no good hoping the next 10 years will be easier as technology finally frees us all from our frenzied existence. 'Innovations don't eradicate previous methods. They simply add other layers of responsibility to our lives.' How much more can we take? Is it possible to keep up in a speeded-up world without giving up our private lives and personal passions? Actually, yes. Most time-management advice tends to be mechanistic - little tips to help you save half an hour here or there. They can be useful, but they won't do any good if you don't start by examining your own attitude to time, and your own core values. In his book Faster: The Acceleration of Just About Everything, James Gleick coins the term 'hurry sickness' to describe this modern malaise. He points out that although we may be desperate to step off the treadmill, it's also true that we thrive on the speed and adrenaline of modern life.

The 300-year-old institution sits proud above Edinburgh, looking down on its Royal Bank of Scotland rival. </p> <p>But this is no ordinary war and BoS's location, perched uphill aside Edinburgh's imposing castle, counts for little. </p> <p>The war has already entered corporate folklore. By launching bids for NatWest, BoS and the Royal Bank have shaken the staid banking world, broken unspoken rules about hostile bids and, more crucially, rocked their own tight-knit community to the core. </p> <p>They have shattered a common perception that the Scottish banks were protected from unwanted takeovers on political, nationalistic grounds and the two have, for the first time, turned on each other. </p> <p>\"It cannot be in Scotland's interest for two major public institutions to fight in public,\" one Royal Bank shareholder told last week's extraordinary general meeting to back its bid for NatWest. </p> <p>It is from its headquarters in that splendid pile up on the Mound that the BoS plotted its audacious attack on NatWest, an English opponent twice its size. </p> <p>Peter Burt, the shy yet ambitious chief executive of the BoS, had the advantage in firing the first shot in the battle. But he and his righthand man, Gavin Masterton - the life-long banker whom BoS believes should run NatWest - are now on dangerous ground, locked in battle on a second front, where the Royal Bank of Scotland is fighting hard and fast. </p> <p>While the two Scottish banks have long pitched for business against each other, their battles have, until now, been in private and they maintained a public image of healthy yet friendly rivalry. </p> <p>Their furious fight for NatWest has changed that; Mr Burt is engaged in almost daily shots against Sir George Mathewson, his counterpart at the Royal Bank, and Fred Goodwin, the Royal Bank's youthful deputy chief executive, rather than NatWest, the original target of his venom. </p> <p>All the talk in Edinburgh's financial community, now that the initial euphoria about the brave and audacious Scottish banks has died down, is how they will restore their relationship after the Valentine's Day deadline in the battle. </p> <p>Such is the level of sensitivity that senior financiers in the Scottish capital are reluctant to speak publicly. </p> <p>For instance, one senior fund manager whispered last week that his top management had warned him to keep his opinions on the battle to himself. </p> <p>Privately, though, the gloves are off. </p> <p>\"People find it (the personal attacks) distasteful,\" one senior figure in the Edinburgh financial scene said last week. \"This sort of thing has never happened before. Their position had always been never to fight in public,\" another Scot said. </p> <p>The men at the top of the Scottish banks insist that this is a myth. Royal Bank's Sir George laughed off the notion that he and his rivals at BoS hung around, all friends together, in Edinburgh's stylish New Club, avoiding competition with another. He insisted that the two banks have cooperated on major projects in the past and have continued to do so while the battle for NatWest has raged. </p> <p>Try as they might, though, many in Edinburgh find it hard to believe their protestations that life will return to normal on February 15. </p> <p>For a start, the personal stakes are high for the men who have fought the battle. One of them could be running one of Europe's biggest banks in four weeks' time - if NatWest does not escape their clutches altogether. One of them will be deflated, defeated and dogged by speculation that his bank is vulnerable to a similar hostile bid. </p> <p>\"There has to be a big question mark about them remaining independent,\" one senior banker said. </p> <p>\"During the battle, both have revealed so much of their hands,\" another said, wondering whether this would make life easier for a predator. </p> <p>But both insist they will not be vulnerable to attack after Valentine's Day if they prove to be on the losing side. If both lose, they will feel safe in the belief that the market is not ready for such a major takeover to take place. If only one fails - the smart money is currently backing Royal Bank over BoS - the rise in the losers' share price on takeover speculation could make it difficult for any predator to strike. </p> <p>Yet the concerns, in private, that the Scottish banks could themselves become prey were so great that this fuelled rumours earlier in the battle that Sir George at the Royal Bank was being pressured by the \"financial community\" not to launch a counter bid for NatWest, to prevent such a scenario. </p> <p>Others also dispute the idea the fight is bad for Scotland and the banking sector. </p> <p>\"It's wholly good news for Scotland. I just don't accept the argument that the one which doesn't win will become vulnerable,\" said Ray Perman, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the local lobby group. </p> <p>As the battle enters its crucial, final phase, Mr Goodwin, Sir George's deputy, was last week eager to display a dignified stance, avoiding any of the personal attacks of the kind favoured by the BoS. </p> <p>The Royal Bank, he explained, would keep away from the rhetoric and stick to facts and figures in the last remaining days. His lingering hope is that he might yet secure the backing from the NatWest board for the bid, which would provide the killer blow to his BoS opponent. </p> <p>But, from his office on the Mound, adorned by photographs of his family, BoS's chief operating officer Gavin Masterton, also remained supremely confident of victory. He is convinced that he can run NatWest better than Mr Goodwin would. </p> <p>\"We think we're a better bank than Royal Bank,\" said Mr Masterton, a 58-year-old Scot who has been a banker all his working life.</p>",

Their position had always been never to fight in public,\" another Scot said. The men at the top of the Scottish banks insist that this is a myth. Royal Bank's Sir George laughed off the notion that he and his rivals at BoS hung around, all friends together, in Edinburgh's stylish New Club, avoiding competition with another. He insisted that the two banks have cooperated on major projects in the past and have continued to do so while the battle for NatWest has raged. Try as they might, though, many in Edinburgh find it hard to believe their protestations that life will return to normal on February 15. For a start, the personal stakes are high for the men who have fought the battle. One of them could be running one of Europe's biggest banks in four weeks' time - if NatWest does not escape their clutches altogether. One of them will be deflated, defeated and dogged by speculation that his bank is vulnerable to a similar hostile bid. \"There has to be a big question mark about them remaining independent,\" one senior banker said. \"During the battle, both have revealed so much of their hands,\" another said, wondering whether this would make life easier for a predator. But both insist they will not be vulnerable to attack after Valentine's Day if they prove to be on the losing side. If both lose, they will feel safe in the belief that the market is not ready for such a major takeover to take place. If only one fails - the smart money is currently backing Royal Bank over BoS - the rise in the losers' share price on takeover speculation could make it difficult for any predator to strike. Yet the concerns, in private, that the Scottish banks could themselves become prey were so great that this fuelled rumours earlier in the battle that Sir George at the Royal Bank was being pressured by the \"financial community\" not to launch a counter bid for NatWest, to prevent such a scenario. Others also dispute the idea the fight is bad for Scotland and the banking sector. \"It's wholly good news for Scotland. I just don't accept the argument that the one which doesn't win will become vulnerable,\" said Ray Perman, chief executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the local lobby group. As the battle enters its crucial, final phase, Mr Goodwin, Sir George's deputy, was last week eager to display a dignified stance, avoiding any of the personal attacks of the kind favoured by the BoS. The Royal Bank, he explained, would keep away from the rhetoric and stick to facts and figures in the last remaining days. His lingering hope is that he might yet secure the backing from the NatWest board for the bid, which would provide the killer blow to his BoS opponent. But, from his office on the Mound, adorned by photographs of his family, BoS's chief operating officer Gavin Masterton, also remained supremely confident of victory. He is convinced that he can run NatWest better than Mr Goodwin would. \"We think we're a better bank than Royal Bank,\" said Mr Masterton, a 58-year-old Scot who has been a banker all his working life.",

      "bodyText": "The image of the Holocaust is dented by the fact that trains carrying Jews to concentration camps were \"well provisioned\", the alleged Nazi apologist David Irving said today. A telegram message about a transportation of 944 Jews from Berlin to Lithuania on November 17 1941, decoded by British intelligence at Bletchley Park, Bucks, showed that there was 24 days' worth of food on board for the three-day journey, said the historian. His remarks came as part of the high court case he initiated against American academic Deborah Lipstadt and Penguin Books for libel over claims that he is a \"Holocaust denier\". \"It's a bit of a dent, a tiny dent in the image we have of the Holocaust today,\" the 62-year-old author of Hitler's War told the London court. It went against the accepted image of victims being stuffed into cattle trucks and shipped across Europe with no food or water, to arrive half dead at the other end, he said. In fact, intercepted messages indicated that the trains were equipped with a \"very substantial amount of food\" to keep the Jews going for three weeks after their arrival, he added. Mr Irving says that Ms Lipstadt's 1994 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory alleges he has distorted statistics and documents to serve his own ideological purposes and reach historically untenable conclusions. He says it has generated \"waves of hatred against him\". Cross-examining Mr Irving, Richard Rampton, QC for Prof Lipstadt and Penguin, said he was concerned with the historian's \"readiness to leap to conclusions in favour of the SS and the Nazis\". Mr Irving told Mr Justice Gray, who is hearing the case without a jury, that he \"strongly objected\" to the suggestion. \"Here's a British intercept of a SS telegram which has not been quoted by any of your (Rampton's) experts because it doesn't fit into the picture that they are trying to create.\" It was, he said, a \"subtly different picture of how this deportation programme was carried out - brutal and cruel though it was\". Mr Rampton said that far from it being a \"dent in Holocaust perception\", it was quite possible that the food had been paid for by the Jews on the shipment. Mr Irving agreed that it was quite probable because the Jews kicked out of Berlin were \"robbed blind\". He said that he did not doubt that there was a \"lot of hardship and cruelty and barbarism\", but he questioned the impartiality of experts for the defence who he said had paid no attention to these documents which \"go against the notion that it was a systematic programme to exterminate Jews\". Mr Rampton showed the court a report which said that 2,934 Jewish evacuees from Berlin and other cities, including women and children, were shot in the east on November 25 1941. Mr Irving said \"it was not impossible\" that the trainload of Jews in the message ended up \"in that atrocity\". He agreed that up to 1.5m Jews were shot in the east, but denied that they were \"part of the system\". \"The system ended when the train arrived. The system put the victims on the trains and sent them to the east with food and equipment to start a new life. \"Once they arrived on the spot, the system broke down and the murderers stepped in,\" he said.

      "body": "<p><strong>BABBELING ON</strong></p> <p>The Fiver loves nothing more than a tiresome transfer saga which starts out tediously and doesn't really improve with age. So imagine how upset we were when Markus Babbel, whom Liverpool have been chasing since the Shankly era, signed for the Reds today on the Bosman ruling. The Bayern Munich defender, who can play at centre or right-back, will move to Anfield in the summer on a free transfer, where he will earn \u00a323,000 per week for four years.</p> <p>\"It is a dream for me to sign for Liverpool,\" said the charming 27-year-old German international, who then spoiled the effect by adding, \"because I have wanted to play in the Premiership for many years. I have nearly joined Manchester United and Newcastle in the past. But I have followed the fortunes of Liverpool for many years.\"</p> <p>Gerard Houllier sounded a bit happier. \"He is a full international with plenty of experience who will add strength to our defence!\" he exclaimed, his bulbous eyes nearly falling out of their sockets. \"He can play right-back or in the centre of defence!\" continued the Liverpool boss in the style of an advertising copywriter.</p> <p>With the Babbel deal done, the Fiver has one less dull tale to trot out whenever things get a bit quiet. What are we to do now? How about Houllier's efforts to find a club prepared to part with cash for Phil Babb? That one should run for a while.</p> <p><strong>THE BIRD AND THE BEAK</strong></p> <p>You can't get away with anything nowadays. Ben Thatcher thought that by running right next to Nicky Summerbee and waggling about a bit he would disguise his magnificent flying elbow. But to no avail: the Wimbledon defender got a two match ban. On Saturday, Paulo Di Canio thought a sneaky one-fingered salute to travelling Aston Villa fans would never be spotted if he did it behind his back. After seeing his digit plastered all over this morning's papers, he may have changed his mind.</p> <p>Di Canio could simply have been signalling how many certified sitters Paolo Wanchope had missed at Upton Park that day (in which case he should have flicked a V). But the FA are likely to accuse the Italian of an infringement of rule 26, a10 (that's 'bringing the game into disrepute' to you and me) if his roving hands make it into referee Graham Poll's match report. The report should arrive at Lancaster Gate on Wednesday, so get there before 9am, Paulo, and there's a chance of nicking off with the postie's bag.</p> <p>The likelihood of action against Di Canio raises concern over wider disciplinary issues. If the 31-year-old is punished for his indiscretion, what kind of an example does it set for kids around the country? Will the bird, cunningly disguised as a rub of the eye, become a thing of the past?

      "bodyText": "BABBELING ON The Fiver loves nothing more than a tiresome transfer saga which starts out tediously and doesn't really improve with age. So imagine how upset we were when Markus Babbel, whom Liverpool have been chasing since the Shankly era, signed for the Reds today on the Bosman ruling. The Bayern Munich defender, who can play at centre or right-back, will move to Anfield in the summer on a free transfer, where he will earn \u00a323,000 per week for four years. \"It is a dream for me to sign for Liverpool,\" said the charming 27-year-old German international, who then spoiled the effect by adding, \"because I have wanted to play in the Premiership for many years. I have nearly joined Manchester United and Newcastle in the past. But I have followed the fortunes of Liverpool for many years.\" Gerard Houllier sounded a bit happier. \"He is a full international with plenty of experience who will add strength to our defence!\" he exclaimed, his bulbous eyes nearly falling out of their sockets. \"He can play right-back or in the centre of defence!\" continued the Liverpool boss in the style of an advertising copywriter. With the Babbel deal done, the Fiver has one less dull tale to trot out whenever things get a bit quiet. What are we to do now? How about Houllier's efforts to find a club prepared to part with cash for Phil Babb? That one should run for a while. THE BIRD AND THE BEAK You can't get away with anything nowadays. Ben Thatcher thought that by running right next to Nicky Summerbee and waggling about a bit he would disguise his magnificent flying elbow. But to no avail: the Wimbledon defender got a two match ban. On Saturday, Paulo Di Canio thought a sneaky one-fingered salute to travelling Aston Villa fans would never be spotted if he did it behind his back. After seeing his digit plastered all over this morning's papers, he may have changed his mind. Di Canio could simply have been signalling how many certified sitters Paolo Wanchope had missed at Upton Park that day (in which case he should have flicked a V). But the FA are likely to accuse the Italian of an infringement of rule 26, a10 (that's 'bringing the game into disrepute' to you and me) if his roving hands make it into referee Graham Poll's match report. The report should arrive at Lancaster Gate on Wednesday, so get there before 9am, Paulo, and there's a chance of nicking off with the postie's bag. The likelihood of action against Di Canio raises concern over wider disciplinary issues. If the 31-year-old is punished for his indiscretion, what kind of an example does it set for kids around the country? Will the bird, cunningly disguised as a rub of the eye, become a thing of the past? Will practitioners of 'camouflage' (sticking up your three middle fingers and waggling them about) become social pariahs? A nation holds its breath. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I think we have done enough pioneering for the time being.\" - So that's what it's called. Money Martin Edwards rejecting claims that Manchester United are ready to join a European Super League. ROBSON IS GOOD MANAGER - ROBSON Beleaguered Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson received public support today, when Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson told Boro fans not to worry about Robson's increasingly inept performances. \"It's really important we don't panic,\" Robson said after fans had turned on Robson during Boro's 4-1 home defeat by relegation-threatened Derby.

For example, is the new synergy really just old-fashioned cross-promotion?

What will be the future of journalistic integrity in a world where newspapers, magazines, television news channels and cartoon characters are all part of the same sprawling corporate monolith?</p> <p>That was a question that revealed itself in the starkest terms last Monday morning when Marc Gunther, the media correspondent of Fortune (owned by Time Warner), was due to interview the AOL chairman and his colleagues for a story provisionally entitled: \"Steve Case Wants to Take Over the World\". At 6am, an AOL executive rang to tell Gunther that the interview was off. \"We're buying your company,\" she said. Gunther still plans to write the story, only now, he jokes, it will be retitled: \"Steve Case has Taken Over the World\". </p> <p>For US media watchers it's no joke. Robert McChesney, a communications professor at the university of Illinois, warned that \"the traditional autonomy of journalism that existed arguably from the 1940s and 1950s to the 1980s has come under sustained attack\".</p> <p>It is hard to argue that there has ever been a \"golden age\" for journalistic independence. Newspaper advertisers have always tried to wield their economic muscle. According to Mark Crispin Miller, the director of the Project on Media Ownership at New York university, medical evidence unearthed in 1935 about the dangers of smoking was suppressed for decades in the mainstream press because the tobacco companies were the biggest advertisers in the newspaper business.</p> <p>\"It's the same old problem now, only it's infinitely worse,\" says Miller. \"Reporters have to be careful not merely about offending some group of local advertisers, they have to be aware of a whole range of corporations, including the one that owns the newspaper or network or television station they work for.</p> <p>\"As these media corporations have grown they have got much closer to the government, and their political influence is decisive. There really isn't anything like the same amount of relative independence that the big media had 20 years ago.\"</p> <p>There is no doubt about the increasing concentration of ownership in the media world, with a series of increasingly gargantuan mergers. Four years ago, Warner swallowed Time, then last year the US broadcaster CBS was bought by Viacom (which in turn owns MTV and the publishers Simon &amp; Schuster). Now AOL's acquisition of Time Warner dwarfs them all. More media mergers are rumoured to be on the way, as the other big players seek some old-new media synergy of their own.</p> <p>George Vradenburg, AOL's vice-president for global and strategic policy, insisted that Time and CNN \"will have the same degree of independence that they have today. They're permitted to report as they see fit.\"</p> <p>Time's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, offered a gruff assurance: \"We have a long history of covering these things and we do it with journalistic integrity and we damn well plan to keep doing it that way. We have a lot of practice.\"</p> <p>In Britain, long accustomed to Rupert Murdoch's dominant media role and the constant plugging of BSkyB in his newspapers, such avowals of media independence would be greeted with snorts of cynicism. But in the US they are treated more seriously.</p> <p>\"The brazen way Murdoch meddles with journalism in Britain wouldn't happen here,\" says Gunther of Fortune. He insists that although he writes constantly about Time Warner and its competitors, his corporate masters have not tried to interfere. He also says he has written bullishly about AOL in the past but would, if anything, be more cautious now for fear of appearing a sell-out to his new masters.</p> <p>Miller, at the Project on Media Ownership, agrees that in the US journalistic ethics are probably more robust than in Europe, but he believes the rot is as inevitable as the corporate pursuit of profit. In a recent incident, it was claimed that the ABC television network spiked a story from one of its reporters that Disney Corporation (which owns ABC) had hired convicted child molesters at its theme parks. ABC came back with a statement that the story didn't meet editorial standards. But Miller says such incidents are rare. Self-censorship, he argues, is far more dangerous.</p> <p>\"Usually it isn't necessary for the boss to interfere. The culture of the newsroom in this corporate system tacitly requires you to learn the ropes. You learn what to do and what not to do. You've got to make a living,\" Miller says.</p> <p>The other insidious process that is eroding journalism on both sides of the Atlantic is the increasing emphasis on celebrity and \"lifestyle\". That trend is clearly visible in the US news magazine market, but at Time it has become particularly questioned because of the magazine's role as part of a mega-corporation.</p> <p>Thus, when Time published a cover story about tornadoes a few years ago, the critics were quick to point out the resemblance between the picture on the front and the advertising poster for a newly released Warner Bros film, Twister. Late last year, the toy phenomenon Pokemon appeared on Time's cover - reasonably enough perhaps in view of its grip on children around the world, except that the cover appeared just as Warner launched Pokemon, the movie. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the merger's impact on pluralism on the web has raised as many concerns as its potentially stifling effect on the traditional media of newspapers and television. The world wide web no longer looks like the wide open frontier of free thought it once appeared. Log on these days, and the online options for news and journalism look pretty familiar.</p> <p>\"The internet is being brought fully into the circle of commercial media,\" Professor McChesney of Illinois university points out. \"It is going to have a billion websites from every possible point of view, but it is not going to spawn a new generation of commercially viable media companies. The few that are left are destined to be bought.\"</p> <p>In other words, it does not matter how many quirky online magazines are out there. Only those with the big business backing to advertise intensively are likely to thrive.</p> <p>As Mark Crispin Miller puts it: \"Let's imagine a shopping mall in which the management allows people to come in to sell old jewellery at stalls and so on. But most people are going to go to Starbucks.\"</p> <p>Miller does not believe the corporate annexation of journalism and the internet is inevitable. He says US journalists he talks to \"feel shame and disappointment about having to do work they see as trash.\" In the backlash against Microsoft's overweening power, he sees the outline of a popular revolt of the kind that paved the way for the trust-busting Progressive Era a century ago. \"We could have another popular groundswell against the power of wealth. But in order for that to happen you have to have some sort of independent media.\"</p>",

Miller, at the Project on Media Ownership, agrees that in the US journalistic ethics are probably more robust than in Europe, but he believes the rot is as inevitable as the corporate pursuit of profit. In a recent incident, it was claimed that the ABC television network spiked a story from one of its reporters that Disney Corporation (which owns ABC) had hired convicted child molesters at its theme parks. ABC came back with a statement that the story didn't meet editorial standards. But Miller says such incidents are rare. Self-censorship, he argues, is far more dangerous. \"Usually it isn't necessary for the boss to interfere. The culture of the newsroom in this corporate system tacitly requires you to learn the ropes. You learn what to do and what not to do. You've got to make a living,\" Miller says. The other insidious process that is eroding journalism on both sides of the Atlantic is the increasing emphasis on celebrity and \"lifestyle\". That trend is clearly visible in the US news magazine market, but at Time it has become particularly questioned because of the magazine's role as part of a mega-corporation. Thus, when Time published a cover story about tornadoes a few years ago, the critics were quick to point out the resemblance between the picture on the front and the advertising poster for a newly released Warner Bros film, Twister. Late last year, the toy phenomenon Pokemon appeared on Time's cover - reasonably enough perhaps in view of its grip on children around the world, except that the cover appeared just as Warner launched Pokemon, the movie. Meanwhile, the merger's impact on pluralism on the web has raised as many concerns as its potentially stifling effect on the traditional media of newspapers and television. The world wide web no longer looks like the wide open frontier of free thought it once appeared. Log on these days, and the online options for news and journalism look pretty familiar. \"The internet is being brought fully into the circle of commercial media,\" Professor McChesney of Illinois university points out. \"It is going to have a billion websites from every possible point of view, but it is not going to spawn a new generation of commercially viable media companies. The few that are left are destined to be bought.\" In other words, it does not matter how many quirky online magazines are out there. Only those with the big business backing to advertise intensively are likely to thrive. As Mark Crispin Miller puts it: \"Let's imagine a shopping mall in which the management allows people to come in to sell old jewellery at stalls and so on. But most people are going to go to Starbucks.\" Miller does not believe the corporate annexation of journalism and the internet is inevitable. He says US journalists he talks to \"feel shame and disappointment about having to do work they see as trash.\" In the backlash against Microsoft's overweening power, he sees the outline of a popular revolt of the kind that paved the way for the trust-busting Progressive Era a century ago. \"We could have another popular groundswell against the power of wealth. But in order for that to happen you have to have some sort of independent media.\"",

What really irked him was the fact that the leader was based on a somewhat false premise. </p> <p>It was Dow Jones Newswires, rather than the WSJ which is a separate entity also owned by Dow Jones, which beat the world to the AOL story. Why, though, should Lambert and his staff be so touchy about the censure of a red-top tabloid? Regardless of its mistake about the scoop, is there any truth to the Sun's substantive point that the FT doesn't break big stories? </p> <p>Lambert, who swiftly faxed a list of his paper's claimed scoops to Yelland, is adamant that the FT is often first with the news. He points to two stories on successive days last week: Scottish Media's takeover of Chris Evans's Ginger group and the revelation of a mooted merger between Glaxo and SmithKline. </p> <p>\"What sells newspapers is news,\" he says, \"and our paper is good at getting news, big news. We've had plenty of major corporate scoops, like the Exxon-Mobil merger.\" Lambert notes that in the US, where the FT has gradually been winning sales in the past two years, its promotional advertising campaign is based around its list of scoops. </p> <p>\"Our expansion in New York has been a key element in our breaking of more stories in recent years,\" says Lambert. \"We've been building circulation there despite being up against the Wall Street Journal.\" To get this in perspective, the WSJ sells 1.7m copies in the US while the FT has only just achieved a sale of 100,000. </p> <p>Yelland sees the gap as very significant: \"The FT is regarded as a joke in America. It has no political nous or clout. The Journal is far better in every way.\" </p> <p>Yelland is also scathing about British business journalists in general and the FT staff in particular. \"I've been at press conferences where an entrepreneur, some decent, self-made, hard-working guy, has been making a statement about some success or another. But most of the journalists there were a bunch of old Etonians who clearly find the whole thing distasteful. That's the opposite of the way journalists feel about businessmen in the States.\" </p> <p>He does believe there are \"honourable exceptions\", such as Jeff Randall, the editor of Sunday Business. But Randall doesn't share Yelland's views on the WSJ or the FT. \"The figures speak for themselves,\" he says. \"If the WSJ was essential reading for the British business community, it wouldn't sell as few copies as it does.\" </p> <p>The WSJ has a circulation of about 16,000 in the UK - against the FT's 180,000 - and some 54,000 in continental Europe against the FT's 125,000. Both papers are also running head to head in Asia. Randall, whose paper is just two years old next month and has just recorded a sale of 68,050, is convinced that if the WSJ's journalism was \"irresistible\" the hard-headed leaders of Britain's business world would buy it. </p> <p>\"They choose the FT on week days and our paper on Sundays because we do offer them what they want,\" says Randall. He argues that the approach adopted by the WSJ runs counter to the British culture. \"It's full of thumb-sucking articles exploring the interaction between economics and politics. In Britain, we concentrate on the relationship between business and finance. Personally, I find that more sexy than politics. Let's face it, price-sensitive news and analysis is a must-read. The political stuff is tedious.\" </p> <p>Randall isn't without criticisms of the FT. He thought the Glaxo story was terrific but was amazed that it was placed below a piece on Microsoft's Bill Gates giving up his chief executive role. \"I'd give them 10 out of 10 for the scoop but nil for news values.\" </p> <p>The rumbustious Randall and the intellectual Lambert may be very different characters but they agree that, despite the speed with which stories are now transmitted by electronic media, news remains of paramount importance to them. </p> <p>The Sun is far from the FT's only critic. In a recent article in France's Le Monde, questions were raised about the FT's failure to land really big stories, especially if they involve investigative reporting. </p> <p>The writer, Marc Roche, Le Monde's London-based City correspondent who has worked in Britain for 15 years, says: \"All the time, the FT is after the event. With BCCI, Barings and Maxwell they did well, but only afterwards. I can't remember one big story they've got, except when they get a call before a press conference.\" </p> <p>Some senior executives within Pearson, the owners of the FT, believe that investigative reporting is over-rated. Business people haven't time to read it. Their readers want reliable, straightforward news conveyed with precision. </p> <p>In other words the paper is not meant to be read for pleasure: it is a tool in their professional lives. They do not wish to be provoked, merely informed. Perhaps that's why the Saturday FT is so very different. It is a much more features-oriented package with its lively new magazine. It is also the most popular edition, with last month's Saturday sale up 20% on a year ago. </p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising part of this episode is the fact that what the Sun says should cause such ripples. Lambert has invited Yelland for a drink. It could prove a fascinating conversation.</p>",

But Randall doesn't share Yelland's views on the WSJ or the FT. \"The figures speak for themselves,\" he says. \"If the WSJ was essential reading for the British business community, it wouldn't sell as few copies as it does.\" The WSJ has a circulation of about 16,000 in the UK - against the FT's 180,000 - and some 54,000 in continental Europe against the FT's 125,000. Both papers are also running head to head in Asia. Randall, whose paper is just two years old next month and has just recorded a sale of 68,050, is convinced that if the WSJ's journalism was \"irresistible\" the hard-headed leaders of Britain's business world would buy it. \"They choose the FT on week days and our paper on Sundays because we do offer them what they want,\" says Randall. He argues that the approach adopted by the WSJ runs counter to the British culture. \"It's full of thumb-sucking articles exploring the interaction between economics and politics. In Britain, we concentrate on the relationship between business and finance. Personally, I find that more sexy than politics. Let's face it, price-sensitive news and analysis is a must-read. The political stuff is tedious.\" Randall isn't without criticisms of the FT. He thought the Glaxo story was terrific but was amazed that it was placed below a piece on Microsoft's Bill Gates giving up his chief executive role. \"I'd give them 10 out of 10 for the scoop but nil for news values.\" The rumbustious Randall and the intellectual Lambert may be very different characters but they agree that, despite the speed with which stories are now transmitted by electronic media, news remains of paramount importance to them. The Sun is far from the FT's only critic. In a recent article in France's Le Monde, questions were raised about the FT's failure to land really big stories, especially if they involve investigative reporting. The writer, Marc Roche, Le Monde's London-based City correspondent who has worked in Britain for 15 years, says: \"All the time, the FT is after the event. With BCCI, Barings and Maxwell they did well, but only afterwards. I can't remember one big story they've got, except when they get a call before a press conference.\" Some senior executives within Pearson, the owners of the FT, believe that investigative reporting is over-rated. Business people haven't time to read it. Their readers want reliable, straightforward news conveyed with precision. In other words the paper is not meant to be read for pleasure: it is a tool in their professional lives. They do not wish to be provoked, merely informed. Perhaps that's why the Saturday FT is so very different. It is a much more features-oriented package with its lively new magazine. It is also the most popular edition, with last month's Saturday sale up 20% on a year ago. Perhaps the most surprising part of this episode is the fact that what the Sun says should cause such ripples. Lambert has invited Yelland for a drink. It could prove a fascinating conversation.",

Once he had completely challenged, overhauled and changed Radio Scotland in the mid-90s he immediately started looking for his next challenge. He was rewarded with the controller's job at Radio 4. </p> <p>Now, three years on, he has challenged, overhauled and changed that station as well. Last year, with the appointment of Jenny Abramsky as director of radio (a job he wanted) already in place, Boyle started talking privately about the need to move on. </p> <p>Maybe Boyle had reached his ceiling at the corporation. What other big jobs were there for him to do? The man of revolution was left looking at a job at Radio 4 that was now about refining his own changes. And Boyle has never been a tweaker. </p> <p>He admitted yesterday that the rumours of a desire to become chief executive of the British Library were true. He has written to the library board expressing an interest in becoming Brian Lang's replacement when the present chief executive retires in May. </p> <p>Thoughts immediately turn to the huge changes in radio that now face the BBC and Abramsky. Roger Mosey's move to become the head of television news means there is a gap at Radio 5 Live. That, along with Boyle's departure and the fact that Jim Moir, the head of Radio 2, is likely to move on in the near future, mean that Abramsky, and Greg Dyke, have a chance to make a BBC radio after their own image. </p> <p>Boyle was often known as McBirt - a man who put in place formalised processes to make Radio 4 run more efficiently. He was liked and highly rated by the outgoing director general, who appreciated his adherence to the twin tenets of \"necessary change\" and \"strategic management\". </p> <p>Throughout the battering Boyle took over the changes to Radio 4, much couched in the same language as the attacks on Birt, he stuck steadfastly to his cause, citing copious audience research to show that his Radio 4 was the Radio 4 the listeners wanted. He was finally rewarded with higher listening figures and the radio holy grail - people listening for longer. </p> <p>Now that Boyle-Birt legacy will be tested by Abramsky and Dyke. The new appointment at Radio 4 will certainly be the most high-profile of the changes to come, and the one that will be most scrutinised and commented on by the British establishment. The person who gets the job is charged with tending one of the commanding heights of middle-class existence. </p> <p>Although the news that Boyle was stepping down took no one by surprise, it is immediately clear that there is no obvious successor in the wings - no one standing head and shoulders above other wannabes. For much of the previous two years, the BBC has been distracted by the prolonged handover to Dyke. </p> <p>\"There are four or five possible names that have been drawn up. But the post is certain to be advertised,\" says one key insider. \"It may well be genuinely open to an outsider.\" </p> <p>Of course, the name that springs to everyone's lips when talking of a big cultural figure who would send out all the right signals about the intellectual future of Radio 4 is a certain Lord Bragg. But given the difficulties of his peerage (look what happened to Birt) such a move would surely be impossible. </p> <p>What is certain is that the appointee to the \u00a3100,000-plus post will be someone in the mould of Abramsky, who is highly rated by Dyke and key governors, including the vice-chairwoman of the BBC, Baroness Young. </p> <p>A highly creative if mercurial character, driven by a passion for BBC Radio, above all Radio 4, Abramsky surprised herself by landing the prestigious post of director of radio. Never a strong Birtist, she remains touchingly thrilled with her lot and her desire to put creativity at the heart of her tenure has been welcomed by often demoralised staff. </p> <p>On her appointment, rumours spread about the relationship with Boyle, a touchy but brave man. Such factors can tell us much about who Boyle's successor may be. \"Things were never warm and loving [between the two], but the crockery didn't fly,\" said a senior source. \"You could just tell from the body language that they were not close.\" Crucially, Boyle was seen as driving out a generation of experienced, older radio hands. </p> <p>At the time of Abramsky's appointment, Boyle's controversial revamp of Radio 4, introduced in April 1998, was under question. \"The level of corporate support was not as strong as he might have hoped,\" said an insider. There was a sense that by annoying everyone from politicians (who forced the restoration of Yesterday in Parliament) to the disability lobby (with the axing of Does He Take Sugar?), Boyle had cooked his goose and with it hopes for further promotion. Very quickly Abramsky, former editor of the Today programme, ex-controller of Radio 5 Live and the driving force behind the launch of BBC Online, set up a special study of radio commissioning, under a former trusted deputy, Martin Cox. </p> <p>It was an implicit criticism of the way Boyle had reordered Radio 4. He had chosen an inner group of five thirtysomethings as \"day-part\" editors (commissioning for sectors of the day rather than by genre), some without relevant radio experience, and had skipped a whole generation of older experienced hands, such as Sally Feldman, former editor of Woman's Hour. </p> <p>Abramsky's aim, as radio's champion, was to restore, in part, Radio 4's structure of commissioning by genre and to hand back as much responsibility as possible to experienced people. Boyle's successor will continue those changes. </p> <p>The moves were cemented late last year with the appointment of a trusted radio production figure, Graham Ellis - the man who sorted out the Vanessa Feltz crisis for the BBC - as head of radio production. </p> <p>Ellis is certain to be a front-runner for Boyle's job. So are several women: Helen Boaden, the head of BBC current affairs and a former editor of Radio 4's File on Four; Anne Morrison, head of features and events within BBC Production and a well-qualified administrator; and Anna Carragher, head of broadcasting at BBC Northern Ireland, who also has plenty of experience. Crucially, Carragher remains very close to Abramsky. </p> <p>Importantly, Abramsky praises the way Moir, the former head of BBC television comedy, has run Radio 2. Although Moir's name is not in the frame - his health has been poor - Abramsky's praise tells us that the trawl will be wide and will certainly include executives with a television background. </p> <p>Boyle's departure does allow for a new, post-Birtist, era. Birt was often attacked for giving television the whip hand over radio. Whoever gets Boyle's job, and the one running Radio 5 Live, will be scrutinised closely.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last Monday, eight senior BBC News executives arrived at work to find their posts axed. Their jobs, on salaries of \u00a360,000 upwards, involved overseeing everything from Newsnight to editing News 24 and BBC World. </p> <p>Like snowdrops in January, the cuts - which a surly BBC News PR department tried to hush up - were the first sign to the outside world of a Dykeist BBC spring. \"Delayering\", with the immense savings it implies, has arrived. \"All hell is about to break loose,\" reports a senior figure who expects Greg Dyke's reorganisation, when unveiled in March or April, to be very radical. </p> <p>But there is a real piquancy to this U-turn. When shown the new \"organisation chart\" for BBC News, this was the reaction of one of the redundant managers. \"It was curiously familiar. With the exception of News 24 and BBC World, which weren't invented then, it was precisely back to the way things were run in the 1980s, before John Birt was recruited to head up BBC journalism.\" </p> <p>Even those made redundant see the logic of what is taking place. \"My personal view is that this is excellent news,\" said another person affected.\"This is precisely what we fought for in 1997.\" This refers to one of the most explosive rows to rock BBC News in the 90s. In September '97, BBC News chief executive Tony Hall and Richard Clemmow, then head of TV news sprang a plan to downgrade programme editors in charge of programmes and dedicated teams, adding new \"super editors\". </p> <p>The result was fury. Public resistance from presenters, including Jeremy Paxman, John Humphrys, James Naughtie and Anna Ford, combined with editors including the then Today editor Jon Barton, Kevin Marsh (The World at One) and Peter Horrocks (Newsnight), propelled it on to the front pages. After two days the chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, intervened and had a meeting with Birt and Hall.

      "bodyText": "Last Monday, eight senior BBC News executives arrived at work to find their posts axed. Their jobs, on salaries of \u00a360,000 upwards, involved overseeing everything from Newsnight to editing News 24 and BBC World. Like snowdrops in January, the cuts - which a surly BBC News PR department tried to hush up - were the first sign to the outside world of a Dykeist BBC spring. \"Delayering\", with the immense savings it implies, has arrived. \"All hell is about to break loose,\" reports a senior figure who expects Greg Dyke's reorganisation, when unveiled in March or April, to be very radical. But there is a real piquancy to this U-turn. When shown the new \"organisation chart\" for BBC News, this was the reaction of one of the redundant managers. \"It was curiously familiar. With the exception of News 24 and BBC World, which weren't invented then, it was precisely back to the way things were run in the 1980s, before John Birt was recruited to head up BBC journalism.\" Even those made redundant see the logic of what is taking place. \"My personal view is that this is excellent news,\" said another person affected.\"This is precisely what we fought for in 1997.\" This refers to one of the most explosive rows to rock BBC News in the 90s. In September '97, BBC News chief executive Tony Hall and Richard Clemmow, then head of TV news sprang a plan to downgrade programme editors in charge of programmes and dedicated teams, adding new \"super editors\". The result was fury. Public resistance from presenters, including Jeremy Paxman, John Humphrys, James Naughtie and Anna Ford, combined with editors including the then Today editor Jon Barton, Kevin Marsh (The World at One) and Peter Horrocks (Newsnight), propelled it on to the front pages. After two days the chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, intervened and had a meeting with Birt and Hall. Programme editors remained intact, but in the resulting fudge, the extra tier of executives was installed as well. As buffers between programme editors and the top echelon, it was unclear what taxing administrative duties some of the new executives would do all day. \"Play computer games. Fill in forms, help out in staffing crises,\" one insider suggests. Now that the BBC has decided to get rid of the extra tier, there is a sadness among many at the corporation that the people who took the new jobs are staring at an uncertain future.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Birt is about to meet the man who tells new members of the House of Lords what they can re-name themselves. It's a bit like choosing a domain name on the internet. You start off fancying yourself as Lord Birt of Liverpool, but end up with narrower options because all the other names have been used: Lord Birt of Bootle, say, or Lord Birt of Formby. </p> <p>The lad from Liverpool, who once looked like a walking Afghan coat, says he had no hesitation about accepting the honour which has finally cut short, by just two months, his epic, 13-year-long run at the BBC. </p> <p>Even the new edition of Who's Who puts the closing date of his director- generalship at March 2000, but in fact he's leaving at the end of this month, drawing to a conclusion what some consider the most damaging cultural episode of the post-war years and others the most significant period of leadership in the BBC since the cantankerous retirement of John Reith. Like Reith, Birt is a director- general who has given birth to an adjective: Birtist. Exactly what this word means will be a subject for historians. </p> <p>On the peerage, as on most things, Sir John is clear. \"The only reason we have a new plan is because there is a new circumstance,\" he says. Knowing the itchiness of Birt's colleagues to terminate the prolonged handover to Greg Dyke, I express incredulity. No, he insists, it's clear that \"you can't head an important national institution and be a member of the Upper House\". But a peer could still chair the board of governors? No problem - that's a non-executive job. What about Lord Hollick at United News and Media? He pauses. \"You'll have to ask Clive.\" </p> <p>Was he asked to take the Labour whip in the Lords? \"I can't talk about any of the details,\" he says, which I think means yes. He will, he says, be an active member of the Upper House, contributing to debates on the communications industry and other policy issues. \"But I shall have to learn how to be opinionated.\" So, what's his opinion on the muddled state of government thinking about the way the Upper House is to be constituted? \"Whilst remaining DG I should keep my opinions on such controversial matters to myself.\" </p> <p>As ever, Sir John doesn't give ground easily. When I ask him whether he ever felt tempted to change course at the BBC as a result of the blistering attacks upon him from the likes of Dennis Potter (\"croak-voiced Dalek\") he replies: \"I don't think so.\" Yes, he was hurt. Yes, he thought the attacks unfair, but it's what you expect \"when creative institutions face adverse circumstances\". </p> <p>And there is the nub. \"Adverse circumstances\" is the phrase which can be used to defend, in Sir John's mind, so much of what happened during his tenure at the BBC. All those internal markets, and the split between \"broadcast and production\" - bureaucracy on a Leninist, even Stalinist, scale according to critics like Michael Grade and even Lord (Marmaduke) Hussey, chairman of the BBC for Birt's first decade at the corporation. \"I'm absolutely certain that we got it right and that all these changes have made our programmes better,\" he says. </p> <p>There is, of course, another side to John Birt. The funny, loyal, self-deprecating man who likes nothing better than to clear off with a gang of friends to Barcelona, or for an organised discussion of the case for and against DH Lawrence (yes, he does like a plan, even for a country weekend). </p> <p>Professionally, there was a hint of this other John Birt in his correspondence with Michael Grade when the two fell out in 1987 and which was published recently when Media Guardian serialised Grade's autobiography. The row says an awful lot about Sir John's tenure at the BBC. </p> <p> Grade and Birt had been longtime colleagues in ITV when the latter arrived at Broadcasting House in 1987 to find Grade colourfully ensconced as director of programmes for BBC TV. Grade was the staff's darling, much as Greg Dyke has set out to be. Birt was quickly seen as the cold administrator with the menacing plan, the remote managerial figure who communicated even with senior executives in terse, handwritten notes. </p> <p>Grade, smarting from a couple of Birtian tickings off, dug in to resist Birt's right to intervene on his patch. He appealed to Birt to back off, but got a very different response. \"I ought to have realised that John's grand plan made no provision for the claims of friendship. There was an utter single mindedness which enabled him to press on with his reforms in the teeth of unprecedented hostility. He was so sure that he was right that anyone who challenged his ideas became not just a sceptic but an enemy. The place for enemies was outer darkness, into which some of the most talented and experienced BBC staff were cast. Whatever John put into the organisation, he sure as hell took the fun out of working there.\" </p> <p>When I raise the subject of these letters, Sir John's body language shifts to something more complex. \"Extracts from letters,\" he jabs. OK, but what's his reply? Surely, I suggest, the key is in one of his own letters to Grade where he closes: \"I needed help and a welcome and not what I got.\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" he murmurs, pointing out that he has never discussed these matters in public before. \"When I arrived at the BBC I felt very unwelcome. This was an organisation which had truly been in crisis. The board of governors had fallen out with the board of management. The organisation had had something close to a nervous breakdown. A director-general had been dismissed. I was the first person to join the BBC from the outside world at such a level since the war - and I wasn't welcome.\" </p> <p>How did that hostility show itself? \"The tiniest remark you made to a close colleague, you would read the next day in the Daily Express. This was a wholly new experience for me.\" </p> <p>The breakdown of the relationship with Grade was, he says, part of that. \"It didn't happen casually. Michael didn't set out all the circumstances, but it's not something I feel angry about, it's something I feel regretful about. I don't want to say more.\" </p> <p>This part of him I recognise, having worked closely with Birt as a fellow outsider in the BBC from 1987 to 1990. It was a time of civil war, when Birt's enemies within believed they could reject and so eject him, as they very nearly did - in 1992 he got the nod from the governors to become DG by a single vote. </p> <p>Among the many extraordinary incidents of my own time, and something that reveals what Sir John was faced with, was the occasion when the controller of BBC 1 (Jonathan Powell) flew at the director of news and current affairs (Ron Neil) with his fists. The view of established barons in radio and television was that Birt and anyone associated with him had no place. </p> <p>So, in response, did Sir John harden up? \"You have to learn,\" he says. </p> <p>There is no doubt that he became capable of great toughness, though these qualities were not unfamiliar to those who worked with him when he was a senior manager at LWT. Grade describes a moment when he found himself \"looking into the eyes of a stranger\". This only happened to me once - in a clash with both Birt and the then director-general, Michael Checkland, over an edition of Panorama which Birt wanted to hold back. </p> <p>For the most part, though, I shared Birt's analysis of the BBC's situation. The corporation, unaccustomed to any circumstance other than plenty, found itself under political attack from the Thatcher government and its income frozen in real terms. It simply lacked the managerial expertise to adapt. </p> <p>How close did the BBC come to privatisation? \"I don't think there was ever a plan,\" says Sir John. \"That's not how political parties work. Nor were opinions in the Conservative party uniform - all parties are coalitions.\" The privatisers - Norman Tebbit, for example - were balanced by the resisters, notably, Douglas Hurd, who was home secretary from 1985 to 1989, and David Mellor, heritage secretary in 1992 at a crucial stage of one broadcasting bill. </p> <p>\"Mellor was a bold and brave politician, a doughty fighter, as determined as I was to see the BBC emerge as a powerful public sector organisation as a result of the charter review process. We were staunch allies,\" says Sir John. Among Mellor's crucial moves was the insertion of a programme quality clause for the ITV companies into the broadcasting bill, thus protecting the BBC's flank. </p> <p>From Birt's account, Margaret Thatcher was not quite such a dragon about the BBC as is often suggested. \"She always spoke with restraint when you were with her. She was very conscious of her role as prime minister and she never spoke to me as a party leader about the BBC.\" </p> <p>But the crucial point, Sir John says, was that he arrived at the BBC with his own clear agenda for reform. \"I had seen how ITV had resisted reform and so found itself reformed from the outside - that had quite an impact on me and I resolved that the BBC should not find itself in that position.\" </p> <p>He had also, prior to arriving at Broadcasting House, checked out BBC politics on the other side of the House. \"The people who spoke most passionately about the BBC were on the Labour side,\" he recalls. In other words, he had a firm external coalition for reform, whatever the internal resistance. This, he believes, was vital, prompting him to warn today's broadcasting executives of the dan ger of the industry getting too close to New Labour. \"It would be a huge risk if the industry lost touch with the Conservative party,\" he says. \"You must always work for consensus about the value of an institution and the legitimacy of its strategic goals.\" </p> <p>Rupert Murdoch slots into this narrative cleanly. Having launched a ferocious assault on the BBC through his newspapers and in the interests of establishing Sky Television, Murdoch became, in BBC mythology, Public Enemy Number One. But Sir John didn't see it that way: the fact that Murdoch pushed a reform agenda, albeit one based on commercialising the BBC, was something he found helpful on the grounds that \"any reform agenda was better than none\". In his own eyes, Birt's real enemies were those who argued for no change - including the left of centre press - which backed Birt's most significant internal foes. </p> <p>Birt certainly suffered heavy criticism for doing deals with Murdoch on televising football and for insisting that BBC programmes should be available on all digital platforms - including Sky. \"Others argued we should treat Sky like lepers, but that wouldn't have been in the BBC's interest,\" he maintains. There is no doubt that Sir John's openness to American influence has shaped his reading of global trends in broadcasting, and prompted his boldest decisions - to invest early and heavily in the digital world of multi-channel TV and internet services. </p> <p>How does he now see the future of television? Can he imagine the end of linear television channels, designed for couch potatoes, and their replacement by on-demand programme selection? </p> <p>\"In ten years, a majority of homes in Britain will enjoy the total digital experience, but it may take 20 or 25 years for a world where almost everybody does,\" he says. \"My sense is that linear channels will become less important but they will still be important - the older part of the audience will accept these changes more slowly.\" </p> <p>The role of such channels will, however, change. \"They will become rather like the Empire Leicester Square, where important programmes are shown first. The latterday Walking with Dinosaurs will need a premiere and it will get it on BBC1. </p> <p>\"The future is a multiplicity of services which delivers to individuals something which aligns closely with their own passions and needs. They will go to a place where they can find programmes on demand, and where they will have all the benefits online of being able to join communities of like-minded people. The future will be owned by those organisations which can create the most compelling services. The whole drive of the BBC is to be one of those organisations and we are well ahead of the game.\" </p> <p> It follows, surely, from this \"total digital future\" that the BBC faces change in the next decade even more radical than during the Birt years. \"We have long understood that organisations like Yahoo are fantastically perceptive and agile and we hold them in great admiration. A huge issue for the BBC is getting people inside to understand who the future belongs to and not to see the immediate competitive environment as being the one that most matters. If organisations like the BBC don't understand that, they will diminish and die.\" </p> <p>This is another way of saying that Sir John simply does not rate his British competitors. \"I begin to see some slight signs that they are appreciating the implications,\" he says. \"Most other media organisations in the UK in the last five years have had no idea whatsoever of what was truly at stake - they're a long way behind in the race.\" </p> <p>The implication of this judgment, in terms of the management and organisation of the BBC, is stark. His own managerial structures, however bloodily imposed, should be seen as \"staging posts\", designed to reduce costs and raise efficiency. \"If the BBC doesn't understand that it has to be involved in perpetual revolution, then it won't be as strong in the digital age in ten years' time as it is now,\" he says, noting that BBC managers \"now understand this\". </p> <p>There is, of course, another view. That the BBC should be sticking to its knitting, concentrating its resources on BBC1, Radio 4 and its other core services - paying more attention to the digital underclass than the digerati. Lord Hussey, who as chairman of the BBC governors brought Birt to the BBC, took this line in a House of Lords debate last year. Birt chuckles and comments: \"I can only say that I'm surprised - that's not what he said in the ten years we worked together.\" </p> <p>Quite what Dyke will make of this inheritance, we shall swiftly see. The rumour is that he will raze Birt's managerial structures, including the broadcast/production divide. \"The structure has served its purpose but it has to change,\" says Sir John. \"If I were still DG, I'd be changing it myself.\" </p> <p>Another place where large structural change is in the offing is in the area of broadcasting regulation, a subject on which Sir John expects to make a large contribution from the red benches of the Lords. </p> <p>The challenge for Sir John in his post-BBC years will be to step aside from merely continuing to lobby for the organisation with which he is now so closely identified - a transition many distinguished public figures find difficult when they enter the House of Lords. If he proves to be different, perhaps it will be because he was never quite a BBC man in the first place, although he constantly points out that almost his entire career has been spent in the public service end of broadcasting. </p> <p> Halfway through our conversation, I ask him about the famous row in 1993, when it transpired that he had joined the BBC as deputy director general without even becoming a member of the staff - rather, he was contracting his services through a personal company, in the way that entertainers do. </p> <p>It was, he admits, a serious error. In explaining the decision, however, he says something more interesting. \"It goes way back to the ethos of the 1960s. I worked at Granada, where a large number of people were independently minded, rather maverick. I positively didn't like the idea of employee status - it was the culture of the time. At LWT that continued. I joined the BBC with the same attitude. I didn't relish the idea of staff status.\" </p> <p>It was, he says, a cultural, not a financial decision. \"I didn't have this status for commercial reasons, I did it for cultural reasons, without any detailed knowledge of whether it was in my interest and it turned out it was barely in my interest at all.\" </p> <p>Does he feel now that after 13 years at the BBC he is a different person, or a person with a different culture? Or will he quickly revert to maverick status, culturally and fiscally? \"I don't know the answer to that question,\" he says. His plan is to write an autobiography, the first of several book projects, and to join a select array of public and private sector boards in a non-executive capacity. </p> <p>Does he leave the BBC content? \"I wasn't born to be content,\" he says, not even with the progress of BBC News, whose \"mission to explain\" lay at the heart of his first flush of evangelism. \"I am very proud about what BBC news has become - we are the most powerful news organisation in the world. But do I think that we perfectly explain the key policy areas of the day? No. We do it better than anyone else, but I always feel restless.\" </p> <p>So what does this restless re-engineer of the Reithian heritage see as his legacy in terms of programmes? What three programmes represent the epitome of the John Birt BBC? Three is too few, he complains, and proposes: Cops, The Human Body, League of Gentlemen, Radio 4's Home Truths, Radio 3's Sounding the Century and . . . Teletubbies. </p> <p><em>Ian Hargreaves was a senior executive in BBC news and current affairs from 1987 to 1990. He is Professor of Journalism at Cardiff University</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "John Birt is about to meet the man who tells new members of the House of Lords what they can re-name themselves. It's a bit like choosing a domain name on the internet. You start off fancying yourself as Lord Birt of Liverpool, but end up with narrower options because all the other names have been used: Lord Birt of Bootle, say, or Lord Birt of Formby. The lad from Liverpool, who once looked like a walking Afghan coat, says he had no hesitation about accepting the honour which has finally cut short, by just two months, his epic, 13-year-long run at the BBC. Even the new edition of Who's Who puts the closing date of his director- generalship at March 2000, but in fact he's leaving at the end of this month, drawing to a conclusion what some consider the most damaging cultural episode of the post-war years and others the most significant period of leadership in the BBC since the cantankerous retirement of John Reith. Like Reith, Birt is a director- general who has given birth to an adjective: Birtist. Exactly what this word means will be a subject for historians. On the peerage, as on most things, Sir John is clear. \"The only reason we have a new plan is because there is a new circumstance,\" he says. Knowing the itchiness of Birt's colleagues to terminate the prolonged handover to Greg Dyke, I express incredulity. No, he insists, it's clear that \"you can't head an important national institution and be a member of the Upper House\". But a peer could still chair the board of governors? No problem - that's a non-executive job. What about Lord Hollick at United News and Media? He pauses. \"You'll have to ask Clive.\" Was he asked to take the Labour whip in the Lords? \"I can't talk about any of the details,\" he says, which I think means yes. He will, he says, be an active member of the Upper House, contributing to debates on the communications industry and other policy issues. \"But I shall have to learn how to be opinionated.\" So, what's his opinion on the muddled state of government thinking about the way the Upper House is to be constituted? \"Whilst remaining DG I should keep my opinions on such controversial matters to myself.\" As ever, Sir John doesn't give ground easily. When I ask him whether he ever felt tempted to change course at the BBC as a result of the blistering attacks upon him from the likes of Dennis Potter (\"croak-voiced Dalek\") he replies: \"I don't think so.\" Yes, he was hurt. Yes, he thought the attacks unfair, but it's what you expect \"when creative institutions face adverse circumstances\". And there is the nub. \"Adverse circumstances\" is the phrase which can be used to defend, in Sir John's mind, so much of what happened during his tenure at the BBC. All those internal markets, and the split between \"broadcast and production\" - bureaucracy on a Leninist, even Stalinist, scale according to critics like Michael Grade and even Lord (Marmaduke) Hussey, chairman of the BBC for Birt's first decade at the corporation. \"I'm absolutely certain that we got it right and that all these changes have made our programmes better,\" he says. There is, of course, another side to John Birt. The funny, loyal, self-deprecating man who likes nothing better than to clear off with a gang of friends to Barcelona, or for an organised discussion of the case for and against DH Lawrence (yes, he does like a plan, even for a country weekend). Professionally, there was a hint of this other John Birt in his correspondence with Michael Grade when the two fell out in 1987 and which was published recently when Media Guardian serialised Grade's autobiography. The row says an awful lot about Sir John's tenure at the BBC. Grade and Birt had been longtime colleagues in ITV when the latter arrived at Broadcasting House in 1987 to find Grade colourfully ensconced as director of programmes for BBC TV. Grade was the staff's darling, much as Greg Dyke has set out to be. Birt was quickly seen as the cold administrator with the menacing plan, the remote managerial figure who communicated even with senior executives in terse, handwritten notes. Grade, smarting from a couple of Birtian tickings off, dug in to resist Birt's right to intervene on his patch. He appealed to Birt to back off, but got a very different response. \"I ought to have realised that John's grand plan made no provision for the claims of friendship. There was an utter single mindedness which enabled him to press on with his reforms in the teeth of unprecedented hostility. He was so sure that he was right that anyone who challenged his ideas became not just a sceptic but an enemy. The place for enemies was outer darkness, into which some of the most talented and experienced BBC staff were cast. Whatever John put into the organisation, he sure as hell took the fun out of working there.\" When I raise the subject of these letters, Sir John's body language shifts to something more complex. \"Extracts from letters,\" he jabs. OK, but what's his reply? Surely, I suggest, the key is in one of his own letters to Grade where he closes: \"I needed help and a welcome and not what I got.\" \"Yes,\" he murmurs, pointing out that he has never discussed these matters in public before. \"When I arrived at the BBC I felt very unwelcome. This was an organisation which had truly been in crisis. The board of governors had fallen out with the board of management. The organisation had had something close to a nervous breakdown. A director-general had been dismissed. I was the first person to join the BBC from the outside world at such a level since the war - and I wasn't welcome.\" How did that hostility show itself? \"The tiniest remark you made to a close colleague, you would read the next day in the Daily Express. This was a wholly new experience for me.\" The breakdown of the relationship with Grade was, he says, part of that. \"It didn't happen casually. Michael didn't set out all the circumstances, but it's not something I feel angry about, it's something I feel regretful about. I don't want to say more.\" This part of him I recognise, having worked closely with Birt as a fellow outsider in the BBC from 1987 to 1990. It was a time of civil war, when Birt's enemies within believed they could reject and so eject him, as they very nearly did - in 1992 he got the nod from the governors to become DG by a single vote. Among the many extraordinary incidents of my own time, and something that reveals what Sir John was faced with, was the occasion when the controller of BBC 1 (Jonathan Powell) flew at the director of news and current affairs (Ron Neil) with his fists.

Apart from the news and current affairs output, which he had overhauled as deputy DG, Birt was not responsible for these schedules - in radio, where one DJ can replace another overnight, his impact was sometimes swifter, but in television, his era only really begins when programmes commissioned by the new controllers installed at the same time, Alan Yentob (BBC1) and Michael Jackson (BBC2), came on stream in 1994. </p> <p>This, then, is still the Beeb before Birt - the product of what he called \"the bloated, inefficient BBC that history bequeathed us\" (MacTaggart Lecture, 1996), so debased that only the merciful cruelty of a \"massive attack\" could save it. But what strikes you, comparing the line-ups with those of January 17, 2000, is an impression of plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la meme chose. </p> <p>So tonight's early-evening offerings on BBC1 are A Question of Sport, EastEnders and a spin-off from Watchdog, all three pre-1993 launches. Flanking the second news bulletin are ex-ITV perennial, This Is Your Life, and Soldiers To Be, revisiting any number of 1980s army-training documentaries. After Panorama comes It's Only TV But I Like It, Telly Addicts revamped with celebs. </p> <p>The few discernible changes reduce risk to keep the two channels competitive. Panorama has moved from 9.30pm to 10pm, Horizon from 8pm to 9.30pm. The Late Show has gone. No BBC1 controller nowadays would risk a new sitcom about Glaswegian boxers. True, Gormen- ghast, starting tonight on BBC2, is strikingly adventurous; but back in January 1993 the same channel was premiering Clarissa. </p> <p>This is the opposite of what one might expect, because two months before Birt acceded to power the manifesto of the incoming regime, Extending Choice, committed the corporation to a strategy of anti-populist risk-taking. To justify the continuation of licence-fee funding and the renewal of its charter, the BBC would progressively move away from programming that could be replicated by a commercial broadcaster. \"Distinctive\" output became compulsory. \"Imitative, derivative or formulaic\" programmes were outlawed. </p> <p>If the strategy set out in Extending Choice had been implemented for seven years, the BBC would have axed Neighbours, Hollywood movies, and US dramas or comedies. Most dramas involving detectives and medics, and/or starring former soap stars, would have gone too. </p> <p>Jim Davidson and Hale &amp; Pace could not be poached from ITV. Live football would have vanished, as would the Lottery Show. Successful factual series (eg Airport, Changing Rooms) would have to be abandoned as soon as the opposition came up with a copy (eg Airline, Better Homes). Kids' shows would eschew cartoons. No hits would be played on Radios 1 and 2. </p> <p>Clearly, none of this has happened: in television, controllers recognised the prescriptions of Extending Choice, Birtism's Old Testament, as suicidal, with their minds concentrated by a ratings slump in 1993. Atavistic populist practices continued, and were eventually ratified by People and Programmes, the more pragmatic New Testament, in 1995. When Yentob's head of popular drama, Nick Elliott, was asked by the Guardian how he squared his plethora of detective series with Extending Choice, he replied that he'd never read it. </p> <p>The one marked change of the Birt era has been the ascendancy of trusty reality over chronically unreliable fiction and fun, with BBC1 slots that would have gone to drama or entertainment going to factual output, and BBC2 cutting its commitment to drama serials and single films. And with this shift came a recognition that a diluted version of Reithian and Birtist ideology could be reconciled with ratings rivalry - could even inform hit shows such as Animal Hospital, Antiques Roadshow and Ground Force. </p> <p>Factual series have cheekily borrowed tricks from the genres they supplanted, most obviously in the transformation of the observational documentary into the docu-soap and the emergence of the lifestyle gameshow. Programmes with a wide range of subject-matter - cookery, gardening, DIY, antiques, pets - can be loosely defined as educational, and enlivened by vivid presenters and/or the injection of challenge or competitive features. </p> <p> On Monday, January 18, 1993, a transitional Radio 1 had Simon Mayo hosting the breakfast show, Simon Bates at 9am, Jakki Brambles the lone female DJ at 12.30, Steve Wright at 3pm, Mark Goodier at 6pm, Mark Radcliffe at 9pm and Nicky Campbell at 10pm. Radio 2 fielded exactly the same morning line-up as now, but its afternoon slots were filled by Gloria Hunniford, Ed Stewart and John Dunn. Radios 3 and 4 had much the same mix as today, although on 4, controller James Boyle has reshuffled running orders. Radio 5 had not yet been relaunched as 5 Live. </p> <p>BBC radio in the Birt era has seen the same shift as television from batty purism to realism, with Radio 1 under Matthew Bannister - the man credited with writing Extending Choice - inevitably the most volatile station. Taking over in summer 1993, and bidding sayonara to Smashy and Nicey types such as Bates and Dave Lee Travis, Bannister set about implementing the manifesto, introducing intelligent, quirky DJs - Radcliffe, Danny Baker, Emma Freud - and running speech strands, including comedy, in mid-evening. Certainly \"distinctive\", but the results were catastrophic: in his first seven months, the station lost four and a half million listeners. </p> <p>Over at Radio 2, controller Frances Line was repositioning her network as an oldies' station. Thus the corporation's music channels abandoned on principle the 25-45s, with Radio 1 concentrating on the young, Radio 2 on the over-45s. </p> <p>When the inevitable pragmatic backlash occurred, Radio 1 remained a youth station, but it slashed speech output and reverted - first with Chris Evans, and currently with Zo\u00eb Ball and Chris Moyles - to the highly un-Birtist notion of the personality DJ. </p> <p>Kudos and ratings stability have been regained, but - in contrast to television, where Birtism was never rigorously applied to non-news programming - the Bannister years saw a step-fall in audience figures, not gradual slippage: the station will never come close again to the 19.23m listeners he inherited. </p> <p>Showing all the strategic consistency of the Grand Old Duke of York, Radio 2 meanwhile wooed back the 25-45s under new controller Jim Moir, adding performers jettisoned by Radio 1 (eg the Corrs, Simply Red) to the playlist and even giving breaks to DJs under 50. With similar belated realism, the original plan for a \"rolling news\" 5 Live was abandoned in favour of a hybrid network inheriting the old Radio 5's hefty following of sports fans. </p> <p>In shaking up first BBC News and Current Affairs, then the structures of the entire organisation, there can be no doubting Sir John's impact as a radical reformer. But in terms of what's actually on screen or coming out of the radio, clear-cut differences are often hard to detect - arguably, the networks he bequeaths are much as they would have been under any sensible modernising post-Reithian with no messianic pretensions. To have kept broadly the same programme mix on these networks as in 1993, without most of them suffering precipitate loss of audience share (compared to a 30% share in July 1993, BBC1 is now - week ending December 19 - at 28.8%) , is no small achievement - remembering that the last seven years have seen huge talent and rights inflation, comparatively paltry licence fee increases, remorseless pay-TV and ILR growth, the launch of Channel 5, Talk and Virgin, and an ITV given greater punch by an aggressive Network Centre. </p> <p>But Birt promised much more than mere piffling continuity. In his MacTaggart Lecture (dubbed by some BBC staff \"the Revelation of St John\"), the \"massive attack\" on the bloated pre-Birtist BBC did not just keep budgets static and quality unaffected: \"We have freed hundreds of millions of pounds to spend on programming. The BBC produced wonderful programmes. Now we can produce more. We have enhanced our creativity. We are a BBC on song, at the top of our form.\" </p> <p>Judged by comparison with the past, the BBC's programming record under John Birt is very respectable; judged by his own rhetoric, however, it has miserably failed to do any better than produce more of the same. </p> <p><strong> The Birt Years (1993-99)</strong><br> </p> <p> * Our Friends in the North </p> <p>* Pride and Prejudice </p> <p>* Ballykissangel </p> <p>* The Crow Road </p> <p>* The Cops </p> <p>* Mrs Brown </p> <p>* Men Behaving Badly </p> <p>* The Day Today </p> <p>* Shooting Stars </p> <p>* Driving School </p> <p>* The Naked Chef </p> <p>* The Human Body </p> <p>* Teletubbies </p> <p>* John Humphrys </p> <p>* Chris Moyles </p> <p><strong> Pre-Birt Years (1986-92)</strong><br> </p> <p> * The Singing Detective </p> <p>* Barchester Towers </p> <p>* Casualty </p> <p>* Life and Loves of a She Devil </p> <p>* Making Out </p> <p>* Truly Madly Deeply </p> <p>* One Foot In The Grave </p> <p>* KYTV </p> <p>* Have I Got News For You </p> <p>* The Ark </p> <p>* Keith Floyd </p> <p>* Trials Of Life </p> <p>* The Borrowers </p> <p>* Brian Redhead </p> <p>* DLT</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the media, as in most areas of American public life, the issues of race and discrimination are never far beneath the surface. So it was with some fanfare last week that two of the major broadcast networks, NBC and ABC, reached an agreement with racial equality organisations to try to correct what has long been perceived as a colour bar within the US television industry.</p> <p>Since last summer, when black leaders seized on the fact that none of the 26 new comedy or drama series set to premiere in the autumn of 1999 featured a single figure from the ethnic minorities in a leading role, the networks have been under sustained attack for their apparent failure to embrace racial diversity on camera and, just as importantly, on the studio floors, in the corporate offices and in the boardroom.</p> <p>The networks, nervous of attacks from such a powerful part of the American population, were originally brought up short by Kweisi Mfume, leader of the NAACP (National Association of the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group). He accused the networks of a \"virtual whitewash in programming\" and threatened them with a boycott that would wreak havoc with ratings just at the time when advertising rates were being calculated.</p> <p>The new agreements include initiatives to place more black faces on TV screens. <br> There are also plans to ensure minorities are given the same opportunities as white people as writers, directors, producers, engineers and executives.</p> <p>\"The networks are very white worlds and that's what they're trying to get at,\" says Sig Gissler, professor of journalism at Columbia university. \"To put a few actors into shows only deals with one element of the television universe but what they're trying to do here is get at the superstructure of TV itself and make it more diversified.</p> <p>\"This struggle mirrors what's going on elsewhere in society. How do you get diversity embraced in the mass media, in newspapers and magazines? Nobody feels that we have achieved the full measure of progress.\"</p> <p>Under the NBC deal, the network agreed to provide internships and scholarships to minorities, guaranteed it would increase purchases from minority-owned suppliers and promised that a minority writer would be added to the staff of every new show that wins a second year on the air. The network also pledged to hold a one-day seminar next month with its producers to emphasise its interest in casting more minority parts.</p> <p>ABC's deal similarly concentrates on changing the behind-the-scenes operations in the hope that it eventually makes a difference to what goes on the air. The Disney-owned network said it would assign high-level mentors to minority employees, set up a diversity training programme, consider a producer's diversity record when hiring and tie executive bonuses to success in employing minorities. Similar agreements with CBS and Fox are expected to follow.</p> <p>So far, the initiatives are on a good-faith basis and the NAACP <br> has not yet pressed the networks to introduce a quota system similar to affirmative-action legislation that ensures minority quotas are reached at universities. Many suspect that may come if the networks fail to implement the agreements.</p> <p>But the difficulties in enforcing the ideal of racial diversity are as legion in television as they are in society at large. As soon as the agreements were announced, there was an outcry from Hispanic, Asian and native American groups, who felt they had been excluded.

      "bodyText": "In the media, as in most areas of American public life, the issues of race and discrimination are never far beneath the surface. So it was with some fanfare last week that two of the major broadcast networks, NBC and ABC, reached an agreement with racial equality organisations to try to correct what has long been perceived as a colour bar within the US television industry. Since last summer, when black leaders seized on the fact that none of the 26 new comedy or drama series set to premiere in the autumn of 1999 featured a single figure from the ethnic minorities in a leading role, the networks have been under sustained attack for their apparent failure to embrace racial diversity on camera and, just as importantly, on the studio floors, in the corporate offices and in the boardroom. The networks, nervous of attacks from such a powerful part of the American population, were originally brought up short by Kweisi Mfume, leader of the NAACP (National Association of the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group). He accused the networks of a \"virtual whitewash in programming\" and threatened them with a boycott that would wreak havoc with ratings just at the time when advertising rates were being calculated. The new agreements include initiatives to place more black faces on TV screens. There are also plans to ensure minorities are given the same opportunities as white people as writers, directors, producers, engineers and executives. \"The networks are very white worlds and that's what they're trying to get at,\" says Sig Gissler, professor of journalism at Columbia university. \"To put a few actors into shows only deals with one element of the television universe but what they're trying to do here is get at the superstructure of TV itself and make it more diversified. \"This struggle mirrors what's going on elsewhere in society. How do you get diversity embraced in the mass media, in newspapers and magazines? Nobody feels that we have achieved the full measure of progress.\" Under the NBC deal, the network agreed to provide internships and scholarships to minorities, guaranteed it would increase purchases from minority-owned suppliers and promised that a minority writer would be added to the staff of every new show that wins a second year on the air. The network also pledged to hold a one-day seminar next month with its producers to emphasise its interest in casting more minority parts. ABC's deal similarly concentrates on changing the behind-the-scenes operations in the hope that it eventually makes a difference to what goes on the air. The Disney-owned network said it would assign high-level mentors to minority employees, set up a diversity training programme, consider a producer's diversity record when hiring and tie executive bonuses to success in employing minorities. Similar agreements with CBS and Fox are expected to follow. So far, the initiatives are on a good-faith basis and the NAACP has not yet pressed the networks to introduce a quota system similar to affirmative-action legislation that ensures minority quotas are reached at universities. Many suspect that may come if the networks fail to implement the agreements. But the difficulties in enforcing the ideal of racial diversity are as legion in television as they are in society at large. As soon as the agreements were announced, there was an outcry from Hispanic, Asian and native American groups, who felt they had been excluded. Moreover, the idea of fostering racial diversity under the terms of the agreements carries inherent suspicions. One chief executive of a production studio noted that such an approach, while conceived with the best of intentions, \"might get to be like having the boss's son on your staff\" and NAACP leaders stressed it would not interfere with the creative process and stand in the way of freedom of expression. \"At certain times, the creative process must be allowed to be creative,\" stressed Mfume. \"I don't see the NAACP sitting down and nit-picking every character.\" \"The tricky part comes in implementing diversity,\" says Gissler. \"It's not just about getting the numbers up but making the most of the diversity. One of the problems with the plan is that it comes with a certain suspicion about whether minority hires are qualified or whether they are just bringing them in to meet a number. It's very important for management to get the staff to be supportive and hire good, qualified candidates that can succeed.\" Yet, while the agreements have been broadly welcomed by network executives and black leaders alike, it's uncertain whether they will have much impact on the lack of racial diversity in front of the camera. A sprinkling of black characters have already been added to new shows that had all-white casts before the controversy erupted and though there are strong roles for black actors in some hits like ER, the US TV industry as a whole seems light-years away from the time when Benson, Diff'rent Strokes and The Cosby Show were high-rated, prime-time programming for black and white audiences alike. Twenty years ago, when sitcoms like Benson were at their peak, there were only three networks and the need to cater to minority audiences was self-evident. With the proliferation of cable channels, audiences have fragmented, with minority viewers drawn to stations specifically tailored to meet their concerns - like the black-owned, black-watched BET [Black Entertainment Television] or Hispanic stations like Televisa. It's a well-worn rule that series dealing with race, starring a high proportion of minority actors or dwelling on the black experience, will not find a white audience. High-rated white shows like Friends neither concern themselves with black characters nor find an audience in minority viewers. In fact the only common ground is in NFL football coverage and CBS's 60 Minutes. The only drama series con sidered to have any cross-racial appeal is ER and its audience is still 90% white. The top show among black viewers, Warner Brothers' Steve Harvey Show, ranks just 127th among white viewers. \"Black and white audiences have moved down separate paths. We seem to have less integration in mainstream television but more shows with black casts on cable television,\" says Gissler. But while the dream of racial integration lives on, so too does the corresponding impulse of \"separate but equal\". 'O n one hand there's still an effort to have an integrated society, but there's a parallel impulse to have your own cultural identity,\" says Gissler. \"There's a kind of sundown segregation now. We work together during the day but at night we go back to our separate racial caves and that's reflected in television. Some people would call it self- segregation; black people would call it self-affirmation.\" Many in the industry believe that the black-white divide on network TV is exacerbated by advertisers who are primarily interested in young, white, affluent viewers and provide the networks with little financial incentive to attract minority viewers.

      "trailText": "<p>Gormenghast, the epic tale of byzantine skulduggery, marks an attempt by the BBC to step off the period drama treadmill. It's just a pity, says  Mark Lawson, they didn't pick something with more substance</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For some time in the 80s, Sting owned the rights to Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy. The pop star spoke of a possible movie, although what everyone really dreaded was a concept album. Neither materialised, although he did appear in a radio version. The books have finally been screened as a four-part drama (Gormenghast, BBC2, tonight, 9pm), and though the cast includes almost every senior British character actor - Ian Richardson, Warren Mitchell, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths - those who know the history of the attempts to film the book will inevitably think: where is thy Sting? </p> <p>And, indeed, sting. In theory, this should be the perfect time to televise Gormenghast. Fantasy literature - in its various forms, from Terry Pratchett to David Eddings - is as busy a genre as the strange scuttling little creatures who tend to inhabit such imagined worlds. And digital technology allows for off-the-map gothic locations - such as Peake's mythical aristocratic kingdom of Gormenghast - to be visualised more vividly than ever before. Certainly the BBC seems unusually confident in the project. It is hard to recall another drama advertised and trailed so enthusiastically. </p> <p>And what do you get? Admittedly, Peake has always seemed to me to be a writer who attended a lecture on Dickens and fell asleep after a few lines about grotesques. Each character is allotted a silly name and a single mannerism. The chef is fat and called Swelter (if you can't stand the heat). The 76th Earl of Groan is Lord Sepulchrave and is, indeed, not famously cheerful. Ian Richardson is a television actor of orchestral range, but can do little with this single note of whimsy. Only John Sessions - experienced as an impressionist in fattening out one characteristic - gives a full twitching and scheming inner life to his character, Dr Prunesquallor. </p> <p>Waking up at the end of the Dickens lecture with his worryingly sparse notes, Peake seems to have supplemented his material with some general borrowings from myth and fairytale. There are ugly sisters and various gargoyle employees, but only one legendary borrowing - a grotesque Nativity sequence involving the birth of the Groan heir Titus - interestingly renovates the details. </p> <p>Schoolboy name jokes - the nursemaid is called Nanny Slagg and the name of the hero Titus contains both a breast pun and a beer one - combine with student politics. Whereas Tolkien at least ensured that those who could be bothered might agonise over what the characters and symbols meant, Gormenghast - conceived while Peake was doing national service - is an obvious but wobbly metaphor for the English class system. The crazy and collapsing aristocrats - the Groans - are challenged by the cowering underlings who staff their castle. </p> <p>But, while the ideology may be picture-book, the pictures are at least impressive. In giving the book a look, director Andy Wilson has intriguingly drawn on the discovery that Peake spent his childhood in China. So the sets - which you feared would be rather too Great Elf - are more Last Emperor. Yet, even here, it seems to me that digital and computer technology is more impressive when it recreates reality - for example, the extinct natural history of Walking With Dinosaurs - rather than visualising fiction. The great limitation of fantasy fiction - that the writer is not bound by either the rules of physics or the reality of history - affects Gormenghast at every level. </p> <p>The best aspect of the series is to remind us - as did the recent BBC David Copperfield - that casting is an art in drama. At a time when the budgeting and eventual success of a project is often assumed to depend on the presence of one star (usually David Jason or Robson Green), Copperfield and Gormenghast have subtly drawn from different fields of performance. The Christmas Dickens employed both Maggie Smith and Pauline Quirke, from very different sides of the theatrical sheets, while this Peake piece intriguingly teams Ian Richardson the theatrical grandee with June Brown (Dot Cotton in EastEnders) as Nanny Slagg and Hammer film veteran Christopher Lee as the manservant Flay. </p> <p>Andy Wilson has made the interesting point that television adaptations have concentrated too much on the 19th century and that there should be more versions of works published in viewers' lifetimes. He's right, but Gormenghast - which is, anyway, a pastiche of earlier literature - is not the text to make that case. </p> <p>It's appropriate that the screen version of the Peake should finally emerge at the same time as Raul Ruiz's movie adaptation of Proust. If bringing A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu to the screen has been the fantasy project of highbrow film-makers for several decades, turning Gormenghast into pictures has long been the dream of middlebrow television. In both cases, the books were left on the shelf for so long because they were, in different ways, such literary experiences, achieving their best screening in the heads of readers. With Dickens, television has been able to ground the stories in historical and social realism. Gormenghast is panto Dickens taking place in limbo, just funny names and dusty jokes. </p> <p>After only three weeks it seems right to use for the first time the insult all critics have been storing up. Gormenghast just feels very 20th century. </p>",

      "bodyText": "For some time in the 80s, Sting owned the rights to Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy. The pop star spoke of a possible movie, although what everyone really dreaded was a concept album. Neither materialised, although he did appear in a radio version. The books have finally been screened as a four-part drama (Gormenghast, BBC2, tonight, 9pm), and though the cast includes almost every senior British character actor - Ian Richardson, Warren Mitchell, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths - those who know the history of the attempts to film the book will inevitably think: where is thy Sting? And, indeed, sting. In theory, this should be the perfect time to televise Gormenghast. Fantasy literature - in its various forms, from Terry Pratchett to David Eddings - is as busy a genre as the strange scuttling little creatures who tend to inhabit such imagined worlds. And digital technology allows for off-the-map gothic locations - such as Peake's mythical aristocratic kingdom of Gormenghast - to be visualised more vividly than ever before. Certainly the BBC seems unusually confident in the project. It is hard to recall another drama advertised and trailed so enthusiastically. And what do you get? Admittedly, Peake has always seemed to me to be a writer who attended a lecture on Dickens and fell asleep after a few lines about grotesques. Each character is allotted a silly name and a single mannerism. The chef is fat and called Swelter (if you can't stand the heat). The 76th Earl of Groan is Lord Sepulchrave and is, indeed, not famously cheerful. Ian Richardson is a television actor of orchestral range, but can do little with this single note of whimsy. Only John Sessions - experienced as an impressionist in fattening out one characteristic - gives a full twitching and scheming inner life to his character, Dr Prunesquallor. Waking up at the end of the Dickens lecture with his worryingly sparse notes, Peake seems to have supplemented his material with some general borrowings from myth and fairytale. There are ugly sisters and various gargoyle employees, but only one legendary borrowing - a grotesque Nativity sequence involving the birth of the Groan heir Titus - interestingly renovates the details. Schoolboy name jokes - the nursemaid is called Nanny Slagg and the name of the hero Titus contains both a breast pun and a beer one - combine with student politics. Whereas Tolkien at least ensured that those who could be bothered might agonise over what the characters and symbols meant, Gormenghast - conceived while Peake was doing national service - is an obvious but wobbly metaphor for the English class system. The crazy and collapsing aristocrats - the Groans - are challenged by the cowering underlings who staff their castle. But, while the ideology may be picture-book, the pictures are at least impressive. In giving the book a look, director Andy Wilson has intriguingly drawn on the discovery that Peake spent his childhood in China. So the sets - which you feared would be rather too Great Elf - are more Last Emperor. Yet, even here, it seems to me that digital and computer technology is more impressive when it recreates reality - for example, the extinct natural history of Walking With Dinosaurs - rather than visualising fiction. The great limitation of fantasy fiction - that the writer is not bound by either the rules of physics or the reality of history - affects Gormenghast at every level. The best aspect of the series is to remind us - as did the recent BBC David Copperfield - that casting is an art in drama. At a time when the budgeting and eventual success of a project is often assumed to depend on the presence of one star (usually David Jason or Robson Green), Copperfield and Gormenghast have subtly drawn from different fields of performance. The Christmas Dickens employed both Maggie Smith and Pauline Quirke, from very different sides of the theatrical sheets, while this Peake piece intriguingly teams Ian Richardson the theatrical grandee with June Brown (Dot Cotton in EastEnders) as Nanny Slagg and Hammer film veteran Christopher Lee as the manservant Flay. Andy Wilson has made the interesting point that television adaptations have concentrated too much on the 19th century and that there should be more versions of works published in viewers' lifetimes. He's right, but Gormenghast - which is, anyway, a pastiche of earlier literature - is not the text to make that case. It's appropriate that the screen version of the Peake should finally emerge at the same time as Raul Ruiz's movie adaptation of Proust. If bringing A La Recherche Du Temps Perdu to the screen has been the fantasy project of highbrow film-makers for several decades, turning Gormenghast into pictures has long been the dream of middlebrow television. In both cases, the books were left on the shelf for so long because they were, in different ways, such literary experiences, achieving their best screening in the heads of readers. With Dickens, television has been able to ground the stories in historical and social realism. Gormenghast is panto Dickens taking place in limbo, just funny names and dusty jokes. After only three weeks it seems right to use for the first time the insult all critics have been storing up. Gormenghast just feels very 20th century.",

The delegation was led by Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, who confirmed that Scotland Yard had a file on Gen Pinochet and was considering whether to take any action.

He has given opponents until 5pm tomorrow to present their submissions and several groups have said they will attempt to influence the decision. Four campaign groups, Amnesty International, the Medical Foundation for the Care of the Victims of Torture, the Association of the Relatives of the Disappeared in Chile and the Redress Trust asked Mr Straw to make public Gen Pinochet's health report. Amnesty International said possible action included seeking an immediate judicial review of the way the medical examination on Gen Pinochet was carried out. They have criticised the fact that the tests were carried out in secret, without either medical experts or observers appointed by the other parties involved, and without any details from the medical report being released. The Spanish government also demanded new medical tests on Gen Pinochet. Spanish ministers said they were passing on a request from Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is leading the legal bid to put Gen Pinochet on trial, for further tests to determine whether the 84-year-old is fit to stand trial. The judge has protested at the absence of anyone representing the Spanish court at the medical examination of Gen Pinochet, and the refusal of the former dictator to allow anyone else to read the report.

      "bodyText": "The United States will attempt again this week to shoot down a missile in space in a key test of whether it could soon begin building a national missile defence system, despite bitter objections from Russia. A missile with a dummy warhead will be fired from California late on Tuesday and a revolutionary US \"hit-to-kill\" weapon will be launched from Kwajalein Atoll, 4,300 miles away, shortly afterward to try and hit the warhead 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean. If the weapon pulverises the warhead into space dust at a speed of 15,000 miles per hour, it would be the second successful US hit in three months. Its success or failure would likely affect US President Bill Clinton's decision this summer on whether to begin building a limited US missile defence. The test has international implications and will be watched closely by contractors including Boeing Co., integrator of the proposed national missile defence system, and Raytheon Corp., which builds the 121-pound weapon. Russia has warned that a national missile defence, likely to be based initially in Alaska, would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Moscow has refused a US request to modify the treaty to allow the system. The United States has stressed repeatedly that a modest successor to former President Ronald Reagan's \"Star Wars\" missile defence plan would only protect US cities from limited attack and would not neutralise Russia's massive nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, Washington's European allies are worried that a singular US defence against long-range missiles might isolate the world's only remaining superpower from its long-standing friends and cool America's military commitment to Europe. The four-hour time frame for Tuesday's test will begin at 9pm EST (0200 GMT Wednesday), which is mid-afternoon Wednesday in the western Pacific. This test will be more complicated and difficult than one on October 2 because it will include and integrate the use of space- and ground-based radars in Hawaii and Kwajalein. Those radars, along with pinpoint global positioning systems, will become more and more important as the system evolves. Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters on Friday that the integrated battle management system for the missile defence, which is being developed by TRW Corp., is a key to its success. \"I think that one thing that should be clear is that the most difficult and sophisticated part of this entire programme is really the battle management system,\" he said. \"By far the most complex and difficult part is the part that pulls it all together and sends out the right signals and the right communications to various parts to the interceptor.\" \"As we draw more and more heavily on the battle management system, obviously the tests become more integrated,\" he added. Another senior defence official, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that two successful \"metal on metal\" hits - one of them a fully integrated shot - had been set as a minimum success rate for the series of tests. But Bacon refused to say what might constitute a Defence Department recommendation to Clinton to go ahead with initial construction of a defence site. \"This is a very high priority programme. We are working very hard in this building to give the president the information he needs from the technical side to make a decision sometime this summer,\" he said. \"Obviously if we have a series of tests that are deemed to be failures, we couldn't say that this was ready to deploy. So far, we have had one very good success and we'll have to see what we do on the text test,\" Bacon added. \"We will make a deployment-readiness recommendation to the president and then the president will decide what to do next. This is a presidential decision.\"",

      "body": "<p>The internet has crowned the consumer king. Unrestricted by time or space, the wily shopper can search globally for goods and services, thereby eroding the pricing power of producers. The result? A brave new world of low inflation and unlimited consumer choice. Or so the techno-prophets would it. </p> <p>The reality may be somewhat different. For while the internet is undoubtedly exerting downward pressure on prices in the short term, it may ultimately stunt consumer choice and confer immense monopoly power on a handful of global corporations. </p> <p>In other words, far from being a liberating force for consumers, it may become a tool of economic oppression. </p> <p>The case for the internet being the consumer's friend has been persuasively put by DeAnne Julius, who sits on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. </p> <p>She says that, not only does it allow shoppers to compare the prices of standard goods and services online and bypass the middleman to buy them directly or use that information to extract extra discounts from the local supplier, it has enormous potential to increase the efficiency with which capital and labour are combined in production. </p> <p>\"For many products ICT (information and communications technology) has reduced design times, increased quality control and shrunk the need for precautionary stocks in the production chain,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Improved information flows enable firms to respond more efficiently to shifts in consumer preferences, and to customise their products and services to their needs. The speed and low cost of information transfer has led to greater outsourcing by producers to the cheapest global supplier, spurring and speeding the globalisation process.\" </p> <p>The upshot of all this is a dramatic shift in market power from sellers of goods and services to their customers. </p> <p>With the hi-tech American economy growing rapidly without - so far - creating strong inflationary pressures, there is certainly plenty of evidence to support Ms Julius' thesis about the positive impact of new technology. </p> <p>The UK economy is not immune to these influences. Why else would Ford, which once told its customers they could have any colour Model T they wanted as long as it was black, now be grovelling to them by offering to refund the difference if competitive pressures force it to reduce the prices of its new V-registration cars? </p> <p>However, it may be that consumer power is no more than a passing phase and that producers will eventually regain the upper hand. </p> <p>In a new research paper, City economist Peter Warburton, of Robert Fleming &amp; Co, argues that in a truly global market place, swarming with products and services, the only ones that will survive will be those which stand out among crowd. </p> <p>Producers have always known the value of branding, but in the wired world of the 21st century it will become even more important. </p> <p>Hence the vast expenditure on electronic advertising. \"The logic behind the promotion of power brands is that of universal recognition,\" says Mr Warburton. \"If there is only room for a tiny number of global brands, then the race to establish them is one of strategic importance.

      "bodyText": "The internet has crowned the consumer king. Unrestricted by time or space, the wily shopper can search globally for goods and services, thereby eroding the pricing power of producers. The result? A brave new world of low inflation and unlimited consumer choice. Or so the techno-prophets would it. The reality may be somewhat different. For while the internet is undoubtedly exerting downward pressure on prices in the short term, it may ultimately stunt consumer choice and confer immense monopoly power on a handful of global corporations. In other words, far from being a liberating force for consumers, it may become a tool of economic oppression. The case for the internet being the consumer's friend has been persuasively put by DeAnne Julius, who sits on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. She says that, not only does it allow shoppers to compare the prices of standard goods and services online and bypass the middleman to buy them directly or use that information to extract extra discounts from the local supplier, it has enormous potential to increase the efficiency with which capital and labour are combined in production. \"For many products ICT (information and communications technology) has reduced design times, increased quality control and shrunk the need for precautionary stocks in the production chain,\" she says. \"Improved information flows enable firms to respond more efficiently to shifts in consumer preferences, and to customise their products and services to their needs. The speed and low cost of information transfer has led to greater outsourcing by producers to the cheapest global supplier, spurring and speeding the globalisation process.\" The upshot of all this is a dramatic shift in market power from sellers of goods and services to their customers. With the hi-tech American economy growing rapidly without - so far - creating strong inflationary pressures, there is certainly plenty of evidence to support Ms Julius' thesis about the positive impact of new technology. The UK economy is not immune to these influences. Why else would Ford, which once told its customers they could have any colour Model T they wanted as long as it was black, now be grovelling to them by offering to refund the difference if competitive pressures force it to reduce the prices of its new V-registration cars? However, it may be that consumer power is no more than a passing phase and that producers will eventually regain the upper hand. In a new research paper, City economist Peter Warburton, of Robert Fleming &amp; Co, argues that in a truly global market place, swarming with products and services, the only ones that will survive will be those which stand out among crowd. Producers have always known the value of branding, but in the wired world of the 21st century it will become even more important. Hence the vast expenditure on electronic advertising. \"The logic behind the promotion of power brands is that of universal recognition,\" says Mr Warburton. \"If there is only room for a tiny number of global brands, then the race to establish them is one of strategic importance. The potential rewards are so vast to justify colossal advertising expenditure for the brief interval during which the pecking order is decided.\" Amid all the turmoil which will accompany the introduction of e-commerce, the likelihood is that many old businesses will be replaced by dynamic new ones. But once the dust settles the businesses that triumph could be in a powerful position to reassert themselves against the consumer, who may well face higher prices and less choice. Mr Warburton says that corporations such as Unilever are anticipating these developments. He points out that in September the company announced a strategic cull of its 1,600 brands in order to concentrate on 400 power brands. Mr Warburton says: \"The shortening of the list of brands is a profoundly important development. Whenever a new means of product or service delivery is developed (eg telephone banking and telephone car insurance), the pioneers of the new medium target the most attractive segments of the consumer market and screen out the bad risk and low margin segments. \"A successful online retailer will concentrate on the product lines that are most popular.

I told him I'd sold them for \u00a3500, but that I'd get them back for him if he wrote me an article for the ECCBA brochure. Then I got them out of the boot of the car where I'd stored them along with the pram and a medicine ball. They were a bit ripped but I've sent them out to South Africa. And I'm told on very good authority (Paul Newman of the Telegraph) that his ghosted article will be with me next week. Otherwise Nasser will be getting another phonecall. Next season I hope Essex get back in the first division and that I take 60 wickets or so and get back in the reckoning for England. I know that my chances of a recall are slim, but I'm only 29 and I think that I'm still a good bowler. I had a very good start to the season last year, and I'd done well in South Africa last time, so I like to think that if I'd stayed fit I'd have had a chance of being picked for the tour. I think I would have complemented the other bowlers, and I'm certainly a better batsman than some of them. Mark Ilott was talking to Tanya Aldred",

In return they receive a \u00a3100,000 capital grant and \u00a3120 extra per pupil per year for at least four years. </p> <p>Two weeks ago David Blunkett, the education secretary, said he wanted secondary pupils to have \"individual education plans\" so they could make the best use of teaching expertise at specialist schools in their areas. All pupils should get the chance to study at more than one school, he said. </p> <p>The 36 specialist colleges to be announced this week will include schools in Plymouth, Newcastle, Cumbria, Essex, Halton, St Helens, and the London borough of Islington. </p> <p>The department for education and employment said 86% of English education authorities would now have at least one specialist college. By the last election, there were 222 and 500 are due to be operational by September. </p> <p>Mr Blair said on the BBC1 Breakfast With Frost programme that the government was turning its attention to secondary schools, having sorted out primary schools. </p> <p>\"Look at the Ofsted report on primary schools - they show the highest-ever levels now of literacy and numeracy. We're cutting class sizes for five-, six- and seven-year-olds and now we are able to move on to the comprehensive system. </p> <p>\"So we are going to be announcing a whole new wave of specialist schools, which specialise in particular subjects. By the end of the year 2003, I want one in four of comprehensive schools to be specialist schools.\" </p> <p>The government justifies expansion of the programme by pointing to an improvement in exam results. The first 50 technology colleges increased the proportion of pupils getting at least five good GCSE passes at twice the national average rate since 1994. Last year the improvement at GCSE throughout the specialist sector was two thirds as much again as the figures for all state schools. </p> <p>But Margaret Tulloch, of the Campaign for State Education, said schools should not have to apply for specialist status to get extra funding. \"If giving one in four schools more money means they get better results, surely it would be a good idea to give all of them more. </p> <p>\"They should not have to bid for it. Headteachers are having to go out and raise money before the government agrees to match it. They are acting as fundraisers to get resources that should be provided by the taxpayers,\" she said. </p> <p>The DfEE said specialist schools are developing links with their feeder primaries.

In the end, no one had to tell the fearsome Tyson that he was not welcome in the country - not that there were many volunteers for the task in the first place. Tyson, accompanied by two police officers, gave a gentle smile and a brief flash of his gold teeth to hundreds of waiting fans who greeted his emergence - from underneath a \"no entry\" sign - with frenzied adoration. All eyes at Heathrow were eagerly anticipating the arrival of one man. Not even the presence of George Michael, who was travelling on the same New York Concorde flight as the boxer, drew the crowd's attention as he slipped out of the airport like any other traveller, appearing somewhat bemused at why he was being ignored. After days of controversy surrounding Tyson's arrival, flight BA002 touched down at 5.22pm. Fellow passengers said he slept most of the way, waking now and again to drink water and eat salmon. According to airport officals, Tyson was quickly off the plane and presented his passport to an immigration offical. The boxer spent two seconds at an immigration counter before being handed his passport back and being told to \"have a nice stay\". Tyson simply smiled and took his first offical steps on to British soil. As he emerged from the baggage reclaim area and made his way towards a Mercedes limousine, scores of fans rushed through the terminal building trying to get close to the former world champion. A scrum of security guards formed a protective ring around the boxer as they fought back the crowd, swerved through doors and carefully dodged a couple of baggage trolleys on their way to the waiting car. Submerged in the middle of it all, Tyson gave a brief smile and a clenched-fist salute as he was bundled into the back of the Mercedes and whisked off to a central London hotel to begin training for his first fight in Britain, on January 29 against Julius Francis. A reporter was taken to hospital apparently suffering from shock after she was knocked down in the melee. Perhaps it was not the reception that Tyson expected after spending most of last week up against the ropes as one British politican after another assaulted him verbally. The future of the bout in Manchester was thrown into doubt after it was discovered that the boxer was on a list of people who should be denied automatic entry to Britain. Immigration rules prevent anyone who has been sentenced to 12 months or more for a crime that would carry a similar sentence in this country from entering the UK. Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 and sentenced to six years' imprisonment, leading to demands that he should be prevented from entering the country. The only way he was able to get in was with the permission of the home secretary, Jack Straw, who used his executive powers. Now that Tyson is here, the next 10 days will be spent in the luxury of the Grosvenor House hotel in Park Lane.

If you're interested, you could click onscreen and buy a pair online.\" Howard Kurtz http://www.washingtonpost.com \"At a more fundamental level, several analysts say, the creation of the world's largest media and cyberspace company seems to muddy the original dream of the internet as a democratising force that would enable thousands of individual voices to compete with major media organs. But the rapid expansion of newspaper, magazine and network sites on the web has given it a decidedly corporate cast.\"",

In a move that will provoke the Liberal Democrats, who are demanding a referendum as the price of continued links with Labour, the prime minister sounded a distinctly cool note about electoral reform. Asked on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost whether Labour's next election manifesto would include a commitment to hold a referendum, the prime minister said: \"As to what happens next parliament, well, there'll be a debate or discussion in the Labour party. We'll make up our minds later on that.\" His remarks infuriated the Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy, who last night warned of trouble ahead over Lib-Lab links if Mr Blair failed to live up to his manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on electoral reform. \"We are looking for a consistent commitment to [Labour's] existing manifesto commitment into the future,\" Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Westminster Hour. \"Obviously if, for whatever reasons, that position changes, then all bets are off.\" The Lib Dems have accepted that a referendum will not be held this side of the general election - a decision they have privately welcomed as they know that they would lose the vote at the moment. However, Mr Kennedy is insistent that he will pull the plug on Mr Blair's project to realign the centre left if Labour reneges on its manifesto commitment. His warning, which was first made last weekend, appears to have fallen on deaf ears, judging by Mr Blair's non-committal response to questions on electoral reform yesterday. \"Well, let us see what the manifesto ends up saying,\" the prime minister told David Frost. \"There are all sorts of discussions that are going on and don't take what I've said as meaning either way.\" Mr Blair held out one crumb of comfort for the Lib Dems when he said that he still remained committed to growing cooperation between Labour and the Lib Dems. \"I certainly do want to see a relationship between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party that grows closer over time,\" he said. \"If people are basically modern social democrats who agree with each other then they should work closer with each other.\" The prime minister's apparent indifference to electoral reform underlines the cooling in relations between Labour and the Lib Dems since Mr Kennedy's election last August. Downing Street regards Mr Kennedy as something of a lightweight who has yet to prove himself as a party leader because of mixed signals he has sent out over his commitment to Lib-Lab cooperation. The former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown was highly rated by Downing Street because of his clear commitment to the \"project\" to realign the centre left. He was also seen as a heavyweight who could be a formidable opponent.

      "body": "<p>It has to be said that Larry Kramer does not look like a media mogul. He is not huge. He is not smoking a cigar. His eyes do not look predatory. And he takes an endearingly self-deprecatory line on his own appearance. </p> <p>But then Kramer is about tomorrow's media rather than today's. And his enthusiasm and energy for what the internet offers both journalists and readers is everything that a sceptical European expects from a west coast American. </p> <p>Seated in an office in the elegant Financial Times building overlooking the Thames, Kramer is in London to explain his latest venture, a free internet service designed to bring financial news to Europe's fast-growing army of private investors. </p> <p>The service, <a href=\"http://www.FTMarketWatch.com\">www.FTMarketWatch.com</a>, is a joint venture between the Financial Times, owned by the media group Pearson, and MarketWatch.com, operator of one of America's leading financial websites. In a deal typical of the intricate webbing that laces new media companies together, Market Watch is part-owned by the American broadcasting giant, CBS. </p> <p>The venture represents far more than just another online news service. It is an indication of just how seriously the big players in traditional media now take the new digital world. Faced with the arrival of rival internet services starting from scratch, the big media groups are coming together in an attempt to crush the upstarts. </p> <p>FTMarketWatch.com already exists in US form as CBSMarketWatch.com, America's biggest financial news site. Kramer, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of MarketWatch.com, hopes to replicate in Europe the success of the US service, where demand for financial news has surged on the back of investor enthusiasm for fast-rising share values in technology companies. \"There are only two things that motivate people to go to a financial site: fear and greed,\" Kramer says. \"They have been there throughout history. Greed is about people who want to get rich and make a lot of money, and they believe there are ways to do it now that weren't available to them before.\" </p> <p>Fear, on the other hand, has a broader impact. Individuals are having to take more responsibility for their own finances, a trend established in the US and becoming prevalent in Europe. The result is that people are fearful of being left behind: they see huge sums being made in the stock markets, and feel they must join the game. </p> <p>If Kramer is right, this powerful combination of fear and greed will drive people to internet sites rather than traditional media such as the Wall Street Journal or the FT. This necessitates a fundamental change in the way such newspapers do business. </p> <p>US experience with CBSMarketWatch.com has taught Kramer that the service has three key advantages over traditional media: it is free because it is funded by advertising; it is available on the internet and via partnerships with powerful new media players such as AOL and Yahoo; and it can offer very close to real-time news. When an investor has savings tied up in a volatile share, he or she clearly wants the most up-to-date information possible. </p> <p>Kramer says that as a result far more people now turn to CBSMarketWatch.com than read the Wall Street Journal. Traffic growth across CBSMarketWatch.com has been astronomical. One year ago what would have been a good day now covers about four hours of activity. Capacity has had to increase by 40% a month for the past four months. \"It is just exploding,\" he said. </p> <p>This pedigree, coupled with the power of the FT brand, will make FTMarketWatch.com a formidable competitor for the fledgling services being started in Britain by companies such as TheStreet and BreakingViews, being set up by former FT journalists Hugo Dixon and Jonathan Ford. Already up and running in the US, TheStreet will be launching a British version of its service imminently at TheStreet.co.uk. </p> <p>Kramer says pointedly that CBSMarketwatch.com is four times the size of TheStreet.com in the US. But the reality of the internet is that a competitor can close the gap quickly on a rival if better content is provided: users have little brand loyalty to keep them faithful to one site. So the one sure outcome is that financial journalists are suddenly in big demand. </p> <p>FTMarketWatch.com will be edited by Thom Calandra, editor of the US site and a journalist with experience on the San Francisco Examiner and at the Bloomberg wire service. He will hire 35 journalists within six months, by which time the service will be up and running. </p> <p>Using the FT's affiliation to other European papers such as Les Echos in France, the service will offer national services to each major European market over the next year to 18 months. </p> <p>Kramer argues that the coverage FTMarketWatch.com will offer - market-driven news for the general public - has not existed before in Europe. </p> <p>News editing is crucial: in the US the service has five editors remaking the \"front\" page endlessly, giving users a fast glance at the most important stories of the minute and the day. </p> <p>\"A lot of other news organisations, especially TV and newspapers, that went to the web automated that process. We erred on the side of more news editors. We felt people wanted our assessment of what is important. </p> <p>\"This should be music to the ears of journalists. Ours is a site built by journalists and it understands the value journalists bring to coverage, that you can't automate some things.\" Kramer argues that the news judgements are crucial given that investors will be making rapid decisions on the basis of what they read. </p> <p>Originally a reporter on the San Francisco Examiner, Kramer became a financial reporter on the Washington Post, then assistant to executive editor Ben Bradley, before returning as executive editor of the Examiner. He also has an MBA from Havard. </p> <p>Despite his enthusiasm for the internet, Kramer believes newspapers will survive. \"A paper like the Financial Times has a long future because it is thought-provoking. It lets you take a deep breath and think about events and go at them. Newspapers have their own portability, and the written word still carries weight. Maybe they will be the second, not the first, draft of history. You will not see newspapers breaking news. </p> <p>\"Look at the newspaper business in the US. The newspapers that survived and flourished are the Washington Post and New York Times and LA Times which put things in context. The ones that died are the ones that survived on breaking news, afternoon papers and tabloids. The role just changes.\" </p> <p>Kramer argues that financial news occupies a special place in the news market. Sports fans, for example, will use the net for information but their first stop is the game itself, to see the action. Similarly on entertainment, where users will use the web to supplement the experience of reading a book or seeing a film by visiting related websites. </p> <p>But, he says, \"In the financial world, we are the game. We are the entertainment as well as the coverage. You watch the game in real-time on our site. On top of that, every element of financial services is on the internet and they need a medium to advertise on in that world.\" </p> <p>Kramer says the potential for advertising revenue is huge as a result. Magazines in the US like Business Week and Fortune, he says, make $300m-$400m a year in revenue from advertisers who reach 1m people. CBSMarketWatch had 4.6m monthly visitors in the third quarter last year. Given that an internet service has fewer costs than a conventional publication, the prospects for huge profits are clear. </p> <p>Kramer finishes with a final piece of evangelical prophecy: \"The internet is the medium of choice for financial news. It is better than television, it is better than radio, it is better than newspapers because financial news has a shelf life. This is the fastest way you can get information to people and if you can do it for free that is how they are going to get it.\"</p>",

The service, www.FTMarketWatch.com, is a joint venture between the Financial Times, owned by the media group Pearson, and MarketWatch.com, operator of one of America's leading financial websites. In a deal typical of the intricate webbing that laces new media companies together, Market Watch is part-owned by the American broadcasting giant, CBS. The venture represents far more than just another online news service. It is an indication of just how seriously the big players in traditional media now take the new digital world. Faced with the arrival of rival internet services starting from scratch, the big media groups are coming together in an attempt to crush the upstarts. FTMarketWatch.com already exists in US form as CBSMarketWatch.com, America's biggest financial news site. Kramer, chairman, chief executive and co-founder of MarketWatch.com, hopes to replicate in Europe the success of the US service, where demand for financial news has surged on the back of investor enthusiasm for fast-rising share values in technology companies. \"There are only two things that motivate people to go to a financial site: fear and greed,\" Kramer says. \"They have been there throughout history. Greed is about people who want to get rich and make a lot of money, and they believe there are ways to do it now that weren't available to them before.\" Fear, on the other hand, has a broader impact. Individuals are having to take more responsibility for their own finances, a trend established in the US and becoming prevalent in Europe. The result is that people are fearful of being left behind: they see huge sums being made in the stock markets, and feel they must join the game. If Kramer is right, this powerful combination of fear and greed will drive people to internet sites rather than traditional media such as the Wall Street Journal or the FT. This necessitates a fundamental change in the way such newspapers do business. US experience with CBSMarketWatch.com has taught Kramer that the service has three key advantages over traditional media: it is free because it is funded by advertising; it is available on the internet and via partnerships with powerful new media players such as AOL and Yahoo; and it can offer very close to real-time news. When an investor has savings tied up in a volatile share, he or she clearly wants the most up-to-date information possible. Kramer says that as a result far more people now turn to CBSMarketWatch.com than read the Wall Street Journal. Traffic growth across CBSMarketWatch.com has been astronomical. One year ago what would have been a good day now covers about four hours of activity. Capacity has had to increase by 40% a month for the past four months. \"It is just exploding,\" he said. This pedigree, coupled with the power of the FT brand, will make FTMarketWatch.com a formidable competitor for the fledgling services being started in Britain by companies such as TheStreet and BreakingViews, being set up by former FT journalists Hugo Dixon and Jonathan Ford. Already up and running in the US, TheStreet will be launching a British version of its service imminently at TheStreet.co.uk. Kramer says pointedly that CBSMarketwatch.com is four times the size of TheStreet.com in the US. But the reality of the internet is that a competitor can close the gap quickly on a rival if better content is provided: users have little brand loyalty to keep them faithful to one site. So the one sure outcome is that financial journalists are suddenly in big demand. FTMarketWatch.com will be edited by Thom Calandra, editor of the US site and a journalist with experience on the San Francisco Examiner and at the Bloomberg wire service. He will hire 35 journalists within six months, by which time the service will be up and running. Using the FT's affiliation to other European papers such as Les Echos in France, the service will offer national services to each major European market over the next year to 18 months. Kramer argues that the coverage FTMarketWatch.com will offer - market-driven news for the general public - has not existed before in Europe. News editing is crucial: in the US the service has five editors remaking the \"front\" page endlessly, giving users a fast glance at the most important stories of the minute and the day. \"A lot of other news organisations, especially TV and newspapers, that went to the web automated that process. We erred on the side of more news editors. We felt people wanted our assessment of what is important. \"This should be music to the ears of journalists. Ours is a site built by journalists and it understands the value journalists bring to coverage, that you can't automate some things.\" Kramer argues that the news judgements are crucial given that investors will be making rapid decisions on the basis of what they read. Originally a reporter on the San Francisco Examiner, Kramer became a financial reporter on the Washington Post, then assistant to executive editor Ben Bradley, before returning as executive editor of the Examiner. He also has an MBA from Havard. Despite his enthusiasm for the internet, Kramer believes newspapers will survive. \"A paper like the Financial Times has a long future because it is thought-provoking. It lets you take a deep breath and think about events and go at them. Newspapers have their own portability, and the written word still carries weight. Maybe they will be the second, not the first, draft of history. You will not see newspapers breaking news. \"Look at the newspaper business in the US. The newspapers that survived and flourished are the Washington Post and New York Times and LA Times which put things in context. The ones that died are the ones that survived on breaking news, afternoon papers and tabloids. The role just changes.\" Kramer argues that financial news occupies a special place in the news market. Sports fans, for example, will use the net for information but their first stop is the game itself, to see the action. Similarly on entertainment, where users will use the web to supplement the experience of reading a book or seeing a film by visiting related websites. But, he says, \"In the financial world, we are the game. We are the entertainment as well as the coverage. You watch the game in real-time on our site. On top of that, every element of financial services is on the internet and they need a medium to advertise on in that world.\" Kramer says the potential for advertising revenue is huge as a result. Magazines in the US like Business Week and Fortune, he says, make $300m-$400m a year in revenue from advertisers who reach 1m people. CBSMarketWatch had 4.6m monthly visitors in the third quarter last year. Given that an internet service has fewer costs than a conventional publication, the prospects for huge profits are clear. Kramer finishes with a final piece of evangelical prophecy: \"The internet is the medium of choice for financial news. It is better than television, it is better than radio, it is better than newspapers because financial news has a shelf life. This is the fastest way you can get information to people and if you can do it for free that is how they are going to get it.\"",

Here, seasonally adjusted for the Y2K bug and the Julian calendar, is your year 2000 decoder... In terms of economic behaviour, a fundamental change of step: straight off Beachy Head. A new paradigm that re-models everything we ever thought we knew about markets, labour and consumer goods: purple haze/going through my brain... We are now living in a world without borders: modish concept dreamed up on television gardening programme. Britain, after decades of under-achievement, is now poised to lead Europe in terms of economic growth: as in 1959, 1964, 1973 and 1987. Key to the new economy is a relentless downward pressure on costs - the cost of labour, that is. However, there will, of course, remain high-cost \"hot spots\": profits, rents, prices... Let there be no doubt, nothing could be more obsolete than the old ways of measuring corporate success: such as profitability, turnover and the approval of a respectable accountant. Investors need to learn quickly the new yardsticks: such as chronic losses, a trendy logo and the approval of a public-relations consultant. We need to give maximum encouragement to \"smart regions\" in the new economy: we need to concrete over all the countryside in the south-east. We need to call time on outdated ideas of regional policy - see above. There is no place for sentiment in regional assistance: cut off aid to former mining villages. Transport is pivotal to success in this new, unfamiliar economic environment: no more talk of congestion charges, and let's have extra carriageways for everybody. America is setting the pace as this new decade dawns. It is the model for us all: as were Sweden, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Cuba, the Soviet Union... Make no mistake, globalisation is here to stay: except for asylum seekers, immigrants, refugees, etc... The World Trade Organisation is a monument to international cooperation: in the fields of teargas, rubber bullets, riot control. Only the most backward-looking would seek to reverse the enormous changes seen during the past 20 years: You're the madman. Not me. You are. To oppose free trade is little short of lunacy: Nurse! Quickly! The internet is going to change everything: anyone remember Prestel? We are moving towards a knowledge economy: everyone will work as London taxi drivers. Books, wine, CDs: the only commodities ever mentioned in connection with internet commerce, doubtless to give the impression that the online shopper is a discerning sort of chap rather than an unhygienic sad-cake. Britain can win in the new economy: anything's possible. But it will need discipline and restraint: wage restraint, that is. There is no room at all for uncompetitive working practices: you're fired. However, success and talent must be properly rewarded: share options all round! We are moving into exciting and wonderful new times: just another shot, just a small one... And we can see clearly a bright road ahead: leave the bottle here, it'll save time. There is no gain without pain in the new economic order: cue stock market crash. But tomorrow is another day: the party's over.",

      "body": "<p>The apparent intention of Yevgeny Primakov to pull out of Russia's presidential election in March is a blow to those who had hoped to see a genuinely democratic contest. Only a few months ago, Mr Primakov, a former prime minister backed by the Fatherland-All Russia alliance, looked like a good bet. Then came setbacks in last month's parliamentary elections and Boris Yeltsin's sudden decision to resign. In doing so, he brought forward the election, which had been expected to take place in June, and designated Mr Primakov's main rival, the 46-year-old prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as acting president. Mr Primakov, while not formally quitting the race, has indicated that he will now seek election as speaker of the Duma. A campaign by pro-Kremlin media portraying him as too old, at 70, to take on the top job may have influenced his decision. But with opinion polls showing Mr Putin likely to win 55% of the vote (and beating Mr Primakov by 71% to 15%), and with powerful national and regional politicians defecting to Mr Putin's Unity alliance almost by the day, his cause looks hopeless. Mr Putin's drive for power appears unstoppable at present. His other opponents - the marginalised communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, Grigory Yavlinsky of the small, liberal Yabloko party, and the absurdly rightwing extremist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky - are not seen as challengers who, realistically, can deny him the victory he covets.</p> <p>Despite the appearance for the first time in Russian newspapers of criticism of the conduct of the war in Chechnya, Mr Putin continues to enjoy overwhelming public support for his ruthless line there. There are signs that Russians are also warming to his central campaign theme. This is the need to recreate a strong, centralised state which looks after its people at home and stands up for national interests against the west; which will crack down ruthlessly on terrorism, crime and corruption; and which will bring back Russia's sense of pride and self-worth after a post-communist decade of economic dislocation and political drift.

      "bodyText": "The apparent intention of Yevgeny Primakov to pull out of Russia's presidential election in March is a blow to those who had hoped to see a genuinely democratic contest. Only a few months ago, Mr Primakov, a former prime minister backed by the Fatherland-All Russia alliance, looked like a good bet. Then came setbacks in last month's parliamentary elections and Boris Yeltsin's sudden decision to resign. In doing so, he brought forward the election, which had been expected to take place in June, and designated Mr Primakov's main rival, the 46-year-old prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as acting president. Mr Primakov, while not formally quitting the race, has indicated that he will now seek election as speaker of the Duma. A campaign by pro-Kremlin media portraying him as too old, at 70, to take on the top job may have influenced his decision. But with opinion polls showing Mr Putin likely to win 55% of the vote (and beating Mr Primakov by 71% to 15%), and with powerful national and regional politicians defecting to Mr Putin's Unity alliance almost by the day, his cause looks hopeless. Mr Putin's drive for power appears unstoppable at present. His other opponents - the marginalised communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, Grigory Yavlinsky of the small, liberal Yabloko party, and the absurdly rightwing extremist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky - are not seen as challengers who, realistically, can deny him the victory he covets. Despite the appearance for the first time in Russian newspapers of criticism of the conduct of the war in Chechnya, Mr Putin continues to enjoy overwhelming public support for his ruthless line there. There are signs that Russians are also warming to his central campaign theme. This is the need to recreate a strong, centralised state which looks after its people at home and stands up for national interests against the west; which will crack down ruthlessly on terrorism, crime and corruption; and which will bring back Russia's sense of pride and self-worth after a post-communist decade of economic dislocation and political drift. In this, Mr Putin draws adroitly on Russia's centuries-old belief in the necessity of a powerful leader, an idea rooted not only in the years of Lenin and Stalin but in the tsarist era. His recently announced plans to enhance the security apparatus, to which he once belonged as a KGB spy chief, to increase defence spending by 57%, and to raise state sector pay and pensions all underpin his unashamedly nationalist message.

He spoke fluent English and loved to engage the foreign press, defending his own role while freely criticising President Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>But all his clowning obscured the most important fact about Arkan. Through all their murderous sprees in Croatia and Bosnia, he and his militia were never just a marauding band of privateers. From the beginning they were an essential cog in the brutal machine run by President Milosevic, aimed at carving an ethnically pure Serb state out of the carcass of Yugoslavia.</p> <p>The machine was called the vojna linija - the military line - a chain of command which ran parallel to the old Yugoslav army, through the state security department and the interior ministry. When Arkan and his men arrived at their first major \"operation\", the cleansing of Croats out of Vukovar in 1991, they were in jeeps with interior ministry number plates.</p> <p>Arkan's direct superior in the vojna linija was Radovan Stojcic, an interior ministry thug known as Badza, who was made a general after the war. According to former members of the security apparatus, he was part of the direct line of command running from President Milosevic and Arkan. He was shot dead in similar circumstances in Belgrade three years ago.</p> <p>There are other members of this inner circle still alive: Jovica Stanisic, the former head of the state security service thought still to be living in Belgrade, and his underling, Franko Simatovic, known as Frenki, who runs a paramilitary corps which was active in the brutal ethnic cleansing of Kosovo last year.</p> <p>Perhaps the murders of Badza and Arkan were just the inevitable price of their lifestyle, on the very blurred edge between the security services and the Belgrade mafia. But both Frenki and Mr Stanisic must now be thinking very hard about their future. They are two of the very few people on the planet who can provide chapter and verse about Mr Milosevic's precise role in the mass murders of Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.</p> <p><b> Career criminal</b><br></p> <p>Arkan was chosen young. He was the wayward son of a senior officer in the Yugoslav air force, who turned to petty theft and football hooliganism in the late 1960s. It is said his father first put him in touch with his future employers, the state security police, the Udba, in the hope they could find a use for his skills and energies.</p> <p>It is not known what links were forged then, but the juvenile delinquent graduated to international bank robbery. He knocked off banks all across northern Europe and escaped from Dutch and Belgian jails. It was later reported that those escapes were abetted by the Udba, and that in return he carried out assassinations of Marshal Tito's enemies abroad. His nom de guerre, Arkan, was taken from one of the false passports the Udba provided.</p> <p>He returned to Yugoslavia a rich man in the 1980s, opened a patisserie, took a stake in a hotel and started up a string of other businesses. But his Udba affiliation did not come to an end. Instead it entered a new phase which paved the way for his future life as a warlord.</p> <p>It was arranged for him to take over Red Star Belgrade supporters' club. By that time, Tito was dead and Yugoslavia was showing the early signs of disintegration. Control of Red Star's youth brigades would be helpful if it came to a struggle for Belgrade.</p> <p>In the end that was not necessary. Mr Milosevic emerged from the party ranks and, by exchanging communist red for the bright colours of a vicious brand of Serb nationalism, seized the vacant Yugoslav throne. The struggle for Belgrade was postponed and instead, Arkan's Red Star boys became the core of the Serbian Volunteer Guard - the Tigers.</p> <p>They were equipped with the best uniforms and the best weapons, including Uzis and the kind of Heckler &amp; Koch automatic which put a bullet through Arkan's eye on Saturday. They were turned into professional killers at a training camp in Erdut, near the heart of the Croatian battlefield. Badza was photographed visiting them there in 1991.</p> <p>A former member of the Milosevic ruling circle, a nationalist who became disgruntled with the president's failure to hold on to either Croatia or Bosnia, asked me in 1997: \"Where do you think the guns and Jeeps came from? How do you think Arkan got to all those places? Wherever there was Arkan, there was Badza.\"</p> <p>Arkan's role in Yugoslavia's bloodletting has been well documented. He was there at Vukovar in 1991 and he was there in the first days of the Bosnian war in Bijeljina in March 1992. It was a ruthless massacre of civilians, not by wild-eyed ruffians but by clean-shaven crisply uniformed Tigers. They even allowed an American photographer, Ron Haviv, to come along, producing some of the most harrowing pictures of cold-blooded murder to emerge from the darkness of the war.</p> <p>The aim was clear - to spread terror among Bosnia's Muslims; to act with such brutality and openness that word would spread like wildfire, sparking a panicked flight. It was easier and quicker than fighting from village to village. The technique also brought an added bonus: people fleeing in terror leave most of their valued possessions behind.</p> <p><b> Ruthless killers</b></p> <p>The Tigers were called on whenever the Belgrade regime required extreme brutality coupled with deniability. Mr Milosevic told the US envoy, Richard Holbrooke, that he had \"no influence\" over Arkan. Mr Holbrooke, now US ambassador to the UN, concluded that Arkan was a \"freelance murderer\".</p> <p>As a military force, the Tigers were pathetic. In the face of the Croatian-Bosnian offensive of 1995, they were thrown into the fray in the eastern Bosnian town of Sanski Most. Arkan arrived in town with a supply of expensive food and drink from Belgrade, took over a floor of a hotel as his headquarters, and then left after a few days without fighting when it was clear the situation was hopeless.</p> <p>The next time he came to Bosnia, it was in his reincarnation as a besuited candidate in the country's first post-war elections. Pictures of smiling cherubic face appeared on posters all around Bijeljina, the site of the bloodbath five years earlier.</p> <p>He brought his Serb rock star wife, Ceca. He kissed babies, and claimed to be bewildered by the fact that there were no Muslims left in town.</p> <p>\"I have a lot of friends who are Muslims,\" he told me. \"I used to visit them. They visited me. In Bijelinja, I personally had Muslim friends.\"</p> <p>When I asked about their fate, he shrugged. \"I came and then left after three days. Other people came to power... My guys did not commit one crime.\"</p> <p>In one of the more obscene absurdities of post-war Bosnia, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe gave him \u00a3150,000 towards his election expenses, in the interests of promoting free speech. When an article appeared in the Guardian pointing out this strange turn of events, he wrote a wounded letter to the newspaper protesting his innocence.</p> <p>The lies were as absurd as they were blatant in view of Ron Haviv's chilling photographs, but he was as convincing and charming as a true psychopath can be. He enjoyed chatting in English to the foreign press, and would remember names and faces. The journalists in turn were flattered to be courted by such a notorious figure, and he appeared to seek some sort of redemption in the eyes of the world by striving to pass off his version of history.</p> <p>Months after the war, I went to explore a casino run by Arkan in Belgrade. I was at the roulette wheel soaking up the atmosphere when I sensed a presence behind my shoulder.</p> <p>He was in high spirits. He asked about my health, and continued an exchange from the previous year about Serbia's future.

      "bodyText": "Zeljko Raznatovic was a showman. He loved playing the role of Arkan the warlord, dressing up in special forces fatigues one day, Armani's finest the next. He spoke fluent English and loved to engage the foreign press, defending his own role while freely criticising President Slobodan Milosevic. But all his clowning obscured the most important fact about Arkan. Through all their murderous sprees in Croatia and Bosnia, he and his militia were never just a marauding band of privateers. From the beginning they were an essential cog in the brutal machine run by President Milosevic, aimed at carving an ethnically pure Serb state out of the carcass of Yugoslavia. The machine was called the vojna linija - the military line - a chain of command which ran parallel to the old Yugoslav army, through the state security department and the interior ministry. When Arkan and his men arrived at their first major \"operation\", the cleansing of Croats out of Vukovar in 1991, they were in jeeps with interior ministry number plates. Arkan's direct superior in the vojna linija was Radovan Stojcic, an interior ministry thug known as Badza, who was made a general after the war. According to former members of the security apparatus, he was part of the direct line of command running from President Milosevic and Arkan. He was shot dead in similar circumstances in Belgrade three years ago. There are other members of this inner circle still alive: Jovica Stanisic, the former head of the state security service thought still to be living in Belgrade, and his underling, Franko Simatovic, known as Frenki, who runs a paramilitary corps which was active in the brutal ethnic cleansing of Kosovo last year. Perhaps the murders of Badza and Arkan were just the inevitable price of their lifestyle, on the very blurred edge between the security services and the Belgrade mafia. But both Frenki and Mr Stanisic must now be thinking very hard about their future. They are two of the very few people on the planet who can provide chapter and verse about Mr Milosevic's precise role in the mass murders of Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo. Career criminal Arkan was chosen young. He was the wayward son of a senior officer in the Yugoslav air force, who turned to petty theft and football hooliganism in the late 1960s. It is said his father first put him in touch with his future employers, the state security police, the Udba, in the hope they could find a use for his skills and energies. It is not known what links were forged then, but the juvenile delinquent graduated to international bank robbery. He knocked off banks all across northern Europe and escaped from Dutch and Belgian jails. It was later reported that those escapes were abetted by the Udba, and that in return he carried out assassinations of Marshal Tito's enemies abroad. His nom de guerre, Arkan, was taken from one of the false passports the Udba provided. He returned to Yugoslavia a rich man in the 1980s, opened a patisserie, took a stake in a hotel and started up a string of other businesses. But his Udba affiliation did not come to an end. Instead it entered a new phase which paved the way for his future life as a warlord. It was arranged for him to take over Red Star Belgrade supporters' club. By that time, Tito was dead and Yugoslavia was showing the early signs of disintegration. Control of Red Star's youth brigades would be helpful if it came to a struggle for Belgrade. In the end that was not necessary. Mr Milosevic emerged from the party ranks and, by exchanging communist red for the bright colours of a vicious brand of Serb nationalism, seized the vacant Yugoslav throne. The struggle for Belgrade was postponed and instead, Arkan's Red Star boys became the core of the Serbian Volunteer Guard - the Tigers. They were equipped with the best uniforms and the best weapons, including Uzis and the kind of Heckler &amp; Koch automatic which put a bullet through Arkan's eye on Saturday. They were turned into professional killers at a training camp in Erdut, near the heart of the Croatian battlefield. Badza was photographed visiting them there in 1991. A former member of the Milosevic ruling circle, a nationalist who became disgruntled with the president's failure to hold on to either Croatia or Bosnia, asked me in 1997: \"Where do you think the guns and Jeeps came from? How do you think Arkan got to all those places? Wherever there was Arkan, there was Badza.\" Arkan's role in Yugoslavia's bloodletting has been well documented. He was there at Vukovar in 1991 and he was there in the first days of the Bosnian war in Bijeljina in March 1992. It was a ruthless massacre of civilians, not by wild-eyed ruffians but by clean-shaven crisply uniformed Tigers. They even allowed an American photographer, Ron Haviv, to come along, producing some of the most harrowing pictures of cold-blooded murder to emerge from the darkness of the war. The aim was clear - to spread terror among Bosnia's Muslims; to act with such brutality and openness that word would spread like wildfire, sparking a panicked flight. It was easier and quicker than fighting from village to village. The technique also brought an added bonus: people fleeing in terror leave most of their valued possessions behind. Ruthless killers The Tigers were called on whenever the Belgrade regime required extreme brutality coupled with deniability. Mr Milosevic told the US envoy, Richard Holbrooke, that he had \"no influence\" over Arkan. Mr Holbrooke, now US ambassador to the UN, concluded that Arkan was a \"freelance murderer\". As a military force, the Tigers were pathetic. In the face of the Croatian-Bosnian offensive of 1995, they were thrown into the fray in the eastern Bosnian town of Sanski Most. Arkan arrived in town with a supply of expensive food and drink from Belgrade, took over a floor of a hotel as his headquarters, and then left after a few days without fighting when it was clear the situation was hopeless. The next time he came to Bosnia, it was in his reincarnation as a besuited candidate in the country's first post-war elections. Pictures of smiling cherubic face appeared on posters all around Bijeljina, the site of the bloodbath five years earlier. He brought his Serb rock star wife, Ceca. He kissed babies, and claimed to be bewildered by the fact that there were no Muslims left in town. \"I have a lot of friends who are Muslims,\" he told me. \"I used to visit them. They visited me. In Bijelinja, I personally had Muslim friends.\" When I asked about their fate, he shrugged. \"I came and then left after three days. Other people came to power... My guys did not commit one crime.\" In one of the more obscene absurdities of post-war Bosnia, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe gave him \u00a3150,000 towards his election expenses, in the interests of promoting free speech. When an article appeared in the Guardian pointing out this strange turn of events, he wrote a wounded letter to the newspaper protesting his innocence. The lies were as absurd as they were blatant in view of Ron Haviv's chilling photographs, but he was as convincing and charming as a true psychopath can be. He enjoyed chatting in English to the foreign press, and would remember names and faces. The journalists in turn were flattered to be courted by such a notorious figure, and he appeared to seek some sort of redemption in the eyes of the world by striving to pass off his version of history. Months after the war, I went to explore a casino run by Arkan in Belgrade. I was at the roulette wheel soaking up the atmosphere when I sensed a presence behind my shoulder. He was in high spirits. He asked about my health, and continued an exchange from the previous year about Serbia's future. He announced his heart was with the anti-Milosevic street protests in Belgrade, but he believed the time was not right to make a stand. The president's days were numbered, he said. But in fact it was Arkan who was running out of time. A mass murderer defends himself Arkan wrote to the Guardian on September 14 1996 after two articles in which he was branded a warlord. Here are extracts from that letter: \"I am not a war criminal or 'warlord'... principally because of the American hostility to [my] activities in defence of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, I have been investigated by the prosecutor's office of the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. The result is that I have not been indicted for any war crime\" \"During the second world war, hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed by the Croatian nationalist regime...

But yesterday the only sign of him that remained was his distinctive jeep, stranded in the hotel driveway, too heavy to be lifted by the tow vehicle.</p> <p>The head of the United Nations mission to Bosnia described him yesterday as a psychopath and coward. \"Crying for Arkan is like crying for [Nazi war criminal Adolf] Eichmann,\" said Jacques Klein, a US diplomat. \"I don't think tears can be shed for a psychopathic mass murderer.\"</p> <p>Mr Klein said his only regret was that Arkan had not been brought to justice at the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, which had indicted him for crimes against humanity, including alleged atrocities in Croatia in 1991 and in the 1992-95 Bosnia war.</p> <p>Arkan led the feared Serb \"Tigers\" paramilitary unit which took part in the brutal three-month siege of the city of Vukovar in eastern Croatia in 1991. A year later, he helped the Bosnian Serbs to overrun northern and eastern Bosnia, where he was considered one of the pioneers of \"ethnic cleansing\", his fighters spreading terror among Muslims.</p> <p>He had become an independent force in Serbia through his control of most criminal and black market activities. But he had also gained many enemies. Even his ownership of the top Serbian football club, Obilic, was marked by gangland violence. The Serbian football federation concluded recently that the results of last season's championship should be declared void, following threats made to referees and opposition teams.</p> <p>But Arkan's most dangerous enemies were those in the ruling elite. Once reputed to be close to President Milosevic, he had of late moved further away from governing circles.</p> <p>Analysts in Belgrade say Arkan was disenchanted with the growing influence of the small Yugoslav United Left (JUL) party, led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Key government positions have increasingly been filled by JUL officials, prompting thoughts of defection by some old-guard members of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party.</p> <p>Local journalists say Arkan may have come into conflict with Mr Milosevic's son, Marko, over fuel smuggling into Serbia in violation of international sanctions.

      "bodyText": "The assassination of the notorious warlord and mobster, Zeljko \"Arkan\" Raznatovic, threw Serbia into political uproar yesterday, amid mounting allegations that the murder was sanctioned by President Slobodan Milosevic's ruling elite, who were alarmed at his growing power. The gunning down of the indicted war criminal and two bodyguards in Belgrade's Intercontinental hotel on Saturday evening provided \"confirmation that we are living in a country of state terrorism\", said the controversial opposition politician Vuk Draskovic. \"These liquidations have the aim of spreading fear and insecurity among people,\" said Mr Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement. Arkan seemed unassailable, the commander of his own private army of several thousand experienced fighters. \"I am not afraid of anything, remember this,\" he said only last year. But yesterday the only sign of him that remained was his distinctive jeep, stranded in the hotel driveway, too heavy to be lifted by the tow vehicle. The head of the United Nations mission to Bosnia described him yesterday as a psychopath and coward. \"Crying for Arkan is like crying for [Nazi war criminal Adolf] Eichmann,\" said Jacques Klein, a US diplomat. \"I don't think tears can be shed for a psychopathic mass murderer.\" Mr Klein said his only regret was that Arkan had not been brought to justice at the war crimes tribunal in the Hague, which had indicted him for crimes against humanity, including alleged atrocities in Croatia in 1991 and in the 1992-95 Bosnia war. Arkan led the feared Serb \"Tigers\" paramilitary unit which took part in the brutal three-month siege of the city of Vukovar in eastern Croatia in 1991. A year later, he helped the Bosnian Serbs to overrun northern and eastern Bosnia, where he was considered one of the pioneers of \"ethnic cleansing\", his fighters spreading terror among Muslims. He had become an independent force in Serbia through his control of most criminal and black market activities. But he had also gained many enemies. Even his ownership of the top Serbian football club, Obilic, was marked by gangland violence. The Serbian football federation concluded recently that the results of last season's championship should be declared void, following threats made to referees and opposition teams. But Arkan's most dangerous enemies were those in the ruling elite. Once reputed to be close to President Milosevic, he had of late moved further away from governing circles. Analysts in Belgrade say Arkan was disenchanted with the growing influence of the small Yugoslav United Left (JUL) party, led by Mr Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic. Key government positions have increasingly been filled by JUL officials, prompting thoughts of defection by some old-guard members of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party. Local journalists say Arkan may have come into conflict with Mr Milosevic's son, Marko, over fuel smuggling into Serbia in violation of international sanctions. They say Arkan had been making inroads into this highly profitable business which, they claim, was hitherto dominated by Marko. Opposition leaders said the killing added weight to their demands for a change in government. The leader of the Democratic party, Zoran Djindjic, said the authorities were not capable of guaranteeing security and should therefore be replaced. Mr Draskovic meanwhile is demanding a full investigation into the many unsolved assassinations in Serbia in recent years. Last October he was injured in a suspicious car crash in which four of his associates died. He maintains that this was an officially sponsored attempt on his life. Many in Serbia predict that Arkan's murder could herald a new spate of political assassinations. With the exception of Mr Draskovic, most opposition leaders were yesterday extremely cautious about the wording of their comments on Arkan's death, apparently fearing for their own lives if they were too outspoken.",

Under the plan, police would be alerted if offenders came within 500 metres of an area from which they had been banned by the courts. At the moment electronic tagging systems are only used to detect whether offenders, such as the former Tory minister, Jonathan Aitken, are observing a curfew at an agreed address. The new scheme will involve updating the equipment to detect whether stalkers or violent partners are straying into prohibited areas. \"We are now considering electronic tagging for domestic violence and stalking cases,\" the prime minister told BBC1's Breakfast With Frost. A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the success of existing electronic tagging systems had encouraged the government to extend their use. Of the 15,000 offenders who have been electronically tagged since the launch of the scheme, 95% have complied with curfews. \"This is an area that we are looking at because we want to ensure that victims are better protected,\" the Downing Street spokeswoman said. The government is acting after a series of high-profile cases in which victims of stalkers have spoken of their fear of their attackers returning once they have been freed from jail. Tracey Morgan, who suffered a six-year campaign of intimidation, spoke last year of how the legal system was failing her after her attacker was convicted for the fifth time. \"When he is released, my sentence starts,\" she said of Anthony Burstow when he was jailed in January last year. In March 1996, Burstow, a former Royal Navy petty officer, was jailed for three years for inflicting psychological grievous bodily harm on Ms Morgan. The a case triggered the introduction of anti-stalking laws in 1997. He resumed stalking again in January, 1998, six months after being released on licence. The television presenter Zoe Ball, who has been stalked for the past year, has been forced to take out an injunction banning Colin Scholey from coming near her. The present electronic tagging system, in which prisoners are released early subject to a nightly curfew, was launched last year. Inmates face a curfew which places them under house arrest for a set proportion of the day or night. Their compliance with the curfew is monitored through an electronic tag worn on the ankle which is linked to a central control unit. Offenders who repeatedly breach their curfew faced being returned to prison.",

      "bodyText": "Air quality in the UK during 1999 showed the worst deterioration since modern records began, figures today reveal. The fall, revealed by Friends of the Earth, will come as an embarrassment to the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who six months ago announced that 1998 had seen the biggest ever improvement in air quality. Mr Prescott had by inference claimed that government policy was having a beneficial effect on pollution levels. Experts said the figures showed the British weather, rather than anything the government had been doing, had a very large effect on the environment. It emerged that in 1998 there were fewer spells of high pressure with little or no wind, a requirement for pollution levels to build up. Easterly winds off the continent, which carry French and German fumes to Britain, were also few and far between. However, 1999 proved different and pollution rose dramatically. FoE said the number of days last year on which air pollution exceeded official health standards rose by 20% in urban areas and by 53% in rural areas over 1998. In 1999, pollution levels were above health standards on average one day in every eight at rural monitoring sites and one day in every 13 at urban sites. \"This is the biggest deterioration in air quality since records began in 1993,\" said Roger Higman, an FoE transport campaigner. The figures come two days before the government publishes its air quality strategy. Official figures from a government report will bring some cheer, showing that London is the world's least polluted mega-city - coming ahead of cities such as New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles as the least affected by transport pollution. The report, prepared by Stephen Glaister for the department of health, is likely to be used by the government for not imposing national road congestion targets. It says that if congestion charging is imposed in London by the new mayor, it is likely to have a more noticeable impact on local traffic volumes than fuel prices. Professor Glaister, an independent adviser on pollution from the Imperial College, London, says the level of toxic vehicle emissions is falling nationally as well as in London. But in the capital, it is falling rapidly after the introduction of catalytic exhaust gas converters in 1992 and improved engine technology and fuels. The report says there is a presumption in London that air pollutants damage health. \"Some are, but several of the officially recorded pollutants are of little consequence in London,\" says Prof Glaister. FoE's point, apart from embarrassing Mr Prescott for claiming credit for the weather, is to draw attention to the government's failure to set a traffic reduction target. The government has refused to set a target, despite the fact that 430 MPs have called for him to do so, including 92 of those in Labour's 100 most marginal seats. Mr Prescott has also said he will weaken the government's target to cut levels of deadly particles, mostly from diesel engines, which kill up to 8,100 people every year. Ministers say this because the technology does not exist to do so and it would be wrong to set a target it cannot reach. The department of health estimates that up to 24,000 people a year may die prematurely because of air pollution. Tony Bosworth, FoE's air pollution campaigner, said: \"Air pollution showed a record deterioration in 1999 yet the government is failing to tackle the problem. The government is refusing to set a target for traffic reduction, despite demands from no less than 430 MPs. \"Instead Mr Prescott says he will weaken a key air quality target. \"Parents, pensioners and asthma sufferers will be furious that the government is pandering to the roads lobby while they choke.\"",

Mr Dyke has agreed to sell any shareholdings which conflict with his \u00a3500,000 a year BBC role by the end of April. A sale of his shares in Pearson, the group which owns Penguin books and the Financial Times and whose TV production arm he ran since 1995, has already netted \u00a3800,000. The planned Granada share disposals will add to the already substantial wealth amassed by Mr Dyke, who was also forced to sever his ties with the Labour party as the price of taking the top job at the BBC. A statement from the corporation said Mr Dyke had listed all his personal shareholdings in a letter to the BBC governors about three weeks before he was officially appointed as director general. The matter had also been discussed at a meeting of governors and Mr Dyke had been given nine months in which to dispose of his shares. BBC sources said his financial position was well known to all the governors, who had agreed to follow custom at the corporation and allow Mr Dyke time to dispose of his investments. Tight sale deadlines can force investors to incur losses if market conditions turn against them. Mr Dyke came to own shares in Granada after the Manchester-based firm mounted a successful takeover bid for London Weekend Television, where he was chief executive.

      "bodyText": "A woman tourist injured when a car hit the security gates at the entrance to Downing Street was yesterday flying home with her family to the United States - where she can expect to receive a letter of sympathy from Tony Blair. Ursula Webster, a mother of three, was taken to St Thomas' hospital with a broken leg after Saturday's incident. It happened as she was emerging through the gates with her family after being allowed to walk up to the door of No 10. Her three sons, aged three, six and eight, escaped virtually unscathed as their mother, who was accompanied by her husband, sacrificed her own safety to usher them away. Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister and his family were not in their home at No 11 at the time of the incident. A spokeswoman said Mr Blair would be writing personally to Mrs Webster. She was discharged from hospital yesterday morning after a consultant said she could travel and boarded a flight back to the US with her children. An off-duty NHS nurse was travelling with the family to Newark, New Jersey, via Frankfurt, to help with pain relief during the journey. German airline Lufthansa paid for the flights because the Websters did not have travel insurance. Scotland Yard confirmed yesterday that Stephen Bonnett, a 26-year-old engineer, has been charged following the incident. Bonnett, of Writtle, near Chelmsford, Essex, will appear before Bow Street magistrates in central London today, said a spokeswoman. He is charged with causing grievous bodily harm to Mrs Webster and with dangerous driving. The incident happened at 12.31pm. The ornate black and gold gates outside Downing Street were erected in 1989 on the orders of then prime minister Margaret Thatcher, amid strong opposition at the time from Labour. Former prime minister John Major and his cabinet narrowly escaped injury two years later when an IRA gang fired three mortar bombs from a Ford Transit van in a nearby street. One of the weapons landed in the garden behind No 10, blowing out windows in nearby buildings.",

      "body": "<p>Jack Straw has been severely criticised by Lord Woolf, chairman of the lord chancellor's advisory council on public records, for using the new freedom of information legislation to extend secrecy to cover up some of the worst scandals which hit the monarchy this century.</p> <p>Lord Woolf - who has attacked the home secretary with the full knowledge of Lord Irvine - has accused Mr Straw of turning the clock back by introducing new restrictions to prevent historians getting access to documents covering communications with the monarch and the awarding of honours for 75 years.</p> <p>This would prevent documents on Edward VIII's abdication crisis in 1936 appearing for another 12 years until 2011. It will also put back the disclosures surrounding the former Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson's \"lavender list\" of dubious political honours until 2051 instead of 2006.</p> <p>Details of Lord Woolf's protest have become public after Mr Straw put nine volumes of consultation papers on his new freedom of information bill in the House of Commons library.</p> <p>In it Lord Woolf accuses Mr Straw of being more secretive than the last Tory government over hiding documents that could embarrass the monarchy.</p> <p>\"The previous administration decided that records of this sort should be open to the public after 30 years in the same way as other public records, unless closure was justified under the published criteria. The class exemption of this material for 75 years is thus a considerable regression.\"</p> <p>He is also critical over a new provision banning the disclosure of papers surrounding the award of honours for 75 years.</p> <p>\"Under the existing criteria, the closure of records relating to honours is determined on the basis of personal sensitivity or, occasionally, on the basis of damage to international relations.</p> <p>\"The council can see no justification for introducing a class exemption for all such material for 75 years, regardless of the harm, or lack of it, that might be caused by release.\"</p> <p>Lord Woolf also calls for a more radical approach for the release of documents before they are 30 years old - including a proper review under the FOI bill of all existing documents that should become public under the new law.</p> <p>He points out that every year two kilometres of documents are released - and under the bill people will be able to apply for copies of them.</p> <p>Such a process will \"generate high costs, long delays, and a sharply reduced quality of service for members of the public if it were applied to every one of the two kilometres or so of historical records transferred to the public record office each year.\"</p> <p>He calls for a new code of practice to be issued by the lord chancellor for the release of historical records when the bill becomes law, and for expert advice on which documents should be released to be given to the advisory council on public records.</p> <p>The proposals are bound to be raised by MPs on the council since they are already critical about Whitehall seeking to limit the release of information in these two areas - even when it should be published.</p> <p>MPs on the council are also becoming increasingly puzzled by pressure from the foreign office to limit the release of 30-year-old diplomatic cables on the grounds that overseas governments would object.</p> <p>This objection is looking increasingly bizarre after the US government released sensitive cables only two years old on Princess Diana's funeral and her landmines campaign under its freedom of information laws. Both these would be banned for 75 years under Mr Straw's new bill.</p>",

Lord Woolf - who has attacked the home secretary with the full knowledge of Lord Irvine - has accused Mr Straw of turning the clock back by introducing new restrictions to prevent historians getting access to documents covering communications with the monarch and the awarding of honours for 75 years. This would prevent documents on Edward VIII's abdication crisis in 1936 appearing for another 12 years until 2011. It will also put back the disclosures surrounding the former Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson's \"lavender list\" of dubious political honours until 2051 instead of 2006. Details of Lord Woolf's protest have become public after Mr Straw put nine volumes of consultation papers on his new freedom of information bill in the House of Commons library. In it Lord Woolf accuses Mr Straw of being more secretive than the last Tory government over hiding documents that could embarrass the monarchy. \"The previous administration decided that records of this sort should be open to the public after 30 years in the same way as other public records, unless closure was justified under the published criteria. The class exemption of this material for 75 years is thus a considerable regression.\" He is also critical over a new provision banning the disclosure of papers surrounding the award of honours for 75 years. \"Under the existing criteria, the closure of records relating to honours is determined on the basis of personal sensitivity or, occasionally, on the basis of damage to international relations. \"The council can see no justification for introducing a class exemption for all such material for 75 years, regardless of the harm, or lack of it, that might be caused by release.\" Lord Woolf also calls for a more radical approach for the release of documents before they are 30 years old - including a proper review under the FOI bill of all existing documents that should become public under the new law. He points out that every year two kilometres of documents are released - and under the bill people will be able to apply for copies of them. Such a process will \"generate high costs, long delays, and a sharply reduced quality of service for members of the public if it were applied to every one of the two kilometres or so of historical records transferred to the public record office each year.\" He calls for a new code of practice to be issued by the lord chancellor for the release of historical records when the bill becomes law, and for expert advice on which documents should be released to be given to the advisory council on public records. The proposals are bound to be raised by MPs on the council since they are already critical about Whitehall seeking to limit the release of information in these two areas - even when it should be published. MPs on the council are also becoming increasingly puzzled by pressure from the foreign office to limit the release of 30-year-old diplomatic cables on the grounds that overseas governments would object. This objection is looking increasingly bizarre after the US government released sensitive cables only two years old on Princess Diana's funeral and her landmines campaign under its freedom of information laws. Both these would be banned for 75 years under Mr Straw's new bill.",

Just because you remember the 1960s, they contended, it doesn't mean you weren't there.</p> <p>Asked whether she had ever taken drugs, Edwina Currie, the former Tory health minister (17 in 1963), said flatly: \"No I didn't. I've never even smoked a cigarette. If that's the best they can cook up on Mo Mowlam then she must be doing something right.\"</p> <p>As a pupil at the Liverpool Institute for Girls, she spent a bit of time flirting with Steve Norris who, along with Paul McCartney and George Harrison, attended the boys' school.</p> <p>But as the Beatles went off to cannabis and LSD-raddled fame and fortune, Mr Norris plunged into the drug-free drudgery of Worcester College, Oxford.</p> <p>\"I am very lucky - I am just too old to have been in school or university when drugs were about, so I can honestly say no I didn't,\" said Mr Norris, 18 in 1963.</p> <p>Attempts to pose the question to the BBC's two director-generals, Sir John Birt and Greg Dyke, were met with a flat \"I am unable to offer any comment on that at all\" from a corporation spokesman.</p> <p>John Humphrys, presenter of Radio 4's Today pro gramme and a 20-year-old in 1963, said: \"None of your business, in short.\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I can't quite see why we should be excited as to whether somebody puffed on a spliff at the age of 20 or not. I'd be slightly surprised if most students hadn't. In fact I'd probably treat with a certain scepticism any 40- or 50-year-old who'd been to university and said they'd never so much as had a puff on a spliff.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair, a mere 10 in 1963, dabbled in rock music at Fettes and St John's College, Oxford, but - as he said before becoming Labour leader - \"didn't get into drugs\". William Hague was a child of the 1960s only to the extent that he was born in them (1961). Home secretary Jack Straw (17 in 1963) not only did not take cannabis at Leeds university but actively campaigned against it.</p> <p>The former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, asked if he had ever taken drugs, once testily told a student interviewer: \"I do not accept the validity of the question.\"</p> <p>But an increasingly tolerant attitude to cannabis among prominent people was illustrated by a survey which revealed that, of 81 MPs from the 1997 intake who replied to a survey, 22 had taken illegal drugs. One, David Prior - now Tory deputy chairman - said then: \"I associate my experience with drugs - soft ones - not with Mick Jagger or Aldous Huxley, but with passing my law degree and working in a bank. You can wear a pinstripe suit and be utterly conventional and still roll a joint.\"</p> <p>Mr Ashdown's successor, Charles Kennedy, has called for a royal commission on drugs. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman (12 in 1963) repeated last night that he had taken drugs when a lawyer in London, the last time in about 1980. \"It was some time ago and it happily came and went fairly quickly. Like Mo I found it not of any great interest and certainly with no addictive affects.\"</p> <p>Mr Hughes said Ms Mowlam's revelation would actually help the debate. \"I hope that by Mo making the statement she did the government are not so absolutist about not wanting to talk about changing anything. The fact it happens to be the person in the cabinet office in charge of drugs policy gives more credibility, particularly with users, than the blank 'nothing to do with us, we musn't touch it' approach.\"</p> <p>The publicist Max Clifford said it did not matter if people such as Mo Mowlam had once used cannabis - and even that it would hardly matter if people in her position did so nowadays.</p> <p>\"I know people that take it. I know politicians that use it - so what? To a lot of people it's a form of relaxation and if you are under tremendous pressure, if you find something that doesn't harm you or anybody else then good luck to you.\"</p> <p>Mr Clifford, 20 in 1963, said he had plenty of access to drugs in those days but had never taken them. \"I suppose I never thought I needed it. Most of the people I represented took cannabis and other drugs - everyone I have ever dealt with, from Joe Cocker to Jimi Hendrix. Some of the time there was almost like a cloud in the office.\"</p>",

But as the Beatles went off to cannabis and LSD-raddled fame and fortune, Mr Norris plunged into the drug-free drudgery of Worcester College, Oxford. \"I am very lucky - I am just too old to have been in school or university when drugs were about, so I can honestly say no I didn't,\" said Mr Norris, 18 in 1963. Attempts to pose the question to the BBC's two director-generals, Sir John Birt and Greg Dyke, were met with a flat \"I am unable to offer any comment on that at all\" from a corporation spokesman. John Humphrys, presenter of Radio 4's Today pro gramme and a 20-year-old in 1963, said: \"None of your business, in short.\" But he added: \"I can't quite see why we should be excited as to whether somebody puffed on a spliff at the age of 20 or not. I'd be slightly surprised if most students hadn't. In fact I'd probably treat with a certain scepticism any 40- or 50-year-old who'd been to university and said they'd never so much as had a puff on a spliff.\" Tony Blair, a mere 10 in 1963, dabbled in rock music at Fettes and St John's College, Oxford, but - as he said before becoming Labour leader - \"didn't get into drugs\". William Hague was a child of the 1960s only to the extent that he was born in them (1961). Home secretary Jack Straw (17 in 1963) not only did not take cannabis at Leeds university but actively campaigned against it. The former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, asked if he had ever taken drugs, once testily told a student interviewer: \"I do not accept the validity of the question.\" But an increasingly tolerant attitude to cannabis among prominent people was illustrated by a survey which revealed that, of 81 MPs from the 1997 intake who replied to a survey, 22 had taken illegal drugs. One, David Prior - now Tory deputy chairman - said then: \"I associate my experience with drugs - soft ones - not with Mick Jagger or Aldous Huxley, but with passing my law degree and working in a bank. You can wear a pinstripe suit and be utterly conventional and still roll a joint.\" Mr Ashdown's successor, Charles Kennedy, has called for a royal commission on drugs. Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman (12 in 1963) repeated last night that he had taken drugs when a lawyer in London, the last time in about 1980. \"It was some time ago and it happily came and went fairly quickly. Like Mo I found it not of any great interest and certainly with no addictive affects.\" Mr Hughes said Ms Mowlam's revelation would actually help the debate. \"I hope that by Mo making the statement she did the government are not so absolutist about not wanting to talk about changing anything. The fact it happens to be the person in the cabinet office in charge of drugs policy gives more credibility, particularly with users, than the blank 'nothing to do with us, we musn't touch it' approach.\" The publicist Max Clifford said it did not matter if people such as Mo Mowlam had once used cannabis - and even that it would hardly matter if people in her position did so nowadays. \"I know people that take it. I know politicians that use it - so what? To a lot of people it's a form of relaxation and if you are under tremendous pressure, if you find something that doesn't harm you or anybody else then good luck to you.\" Mr Clifford, 20 in 1963, said he had plenty of access to drugs in those days but had never taken them. \"I suppose I never thought I needed it. Most of the people I represented took cannabis and other drugs - everyone I have ever dealt with, from Joe Cocker to Jimi Hendrix. Some of the time there was almost like a cloud in the office.\"",

In 1910, at the age of 14, she met Bertram D Wolfe at a park tennis court in Brooklyn. He took an instant liking to her, and they were married in 1917, just in time for the October Revolution. They were married for 60 years, until his death in 1977.</p> <p>Barely 5ft tall, Wolfe was striking rather than beautiful, with bright blue eyes that people remembered. She was also steely in her determination, and sharp in repartee.</p> <p>Before the Russian revolution, the Wolfes and their friend John Reed were part of the cultural left in Greenwich Village. In 1919, together with Reed, Bert Wolfe wrote the Left Wing Manifesto, which created the American Communist Party. After the passage of the 1918 sedition act, the 1920s saw the \"Palmer raids\" in which many foreign-born radicals were deported to the Soviet Union. The Wolfes were forced to live clandestinely; they assumed false names and, on several occasions, were almost caught. They hid in New York, San Francisco and Washington, as well as in Mexico City, where they were friends of the great communist mural artist, Diego Rivera, and of Frida Kahlo, the painter, who had been Trotsky's mistress. In the US, they helped the great exiled Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovski and lent him money. He repaid them by putting it about that Ella was his mistress, which she rejected with amusement rather than anger.</p> <p>Wolfe worked as her husband's unpaid secretary and editor. They decided not to have children, so as to free her for work as a revolutionary, something she later said she regretted. In 1929, Bert became a member of the Comintern, and the couple moved to Moscow, where they met Stalin. Years later, Ella described him as \"smaller than I expected, with a pockmarked face, a brutal mouth and the yellow eyes of a mountain lion\". Bert Wolfe angered Stalin by arguing for \"American exceptionalism\". This was the case (made by the section of the American communist movement known as the \"Lovestonites\", after their leader Jay Lovestone) that Marxist-Leninist ideas should not be automatically applied to conditions in the US but should be adapted.</p> <p>This put them at odds not only with the Stalinists but with the Trotskyists. Although both factions in the US together had fewer than 1,000 members, they continued to argue through their journals, the Lovestonites' Workers Age and the Trotskyists' New International.</p> <p>Stalin decided against Bert Wolfe and his \"American exceptionalism\". The Wolfes were probably lucky to survive; if they had fallen out so publicly with Stalin a few years later, during the great purges, they could well have been eliminated. Bert was expelled from the Communist Party and Ella left two years later after refusing to denounce her husband. By the 1940s, after the Nazi-Soviet pact and Hitler's attack on Russia, which turned the Soviet Union into a \"gallant ally\" to America, the Wolfes had left the Lovestone group.</p> <p>Back in America, Wolfe went to college and earned a master's degree in Spanish at Columbia university in New York. This enabled her to teach, which she did in schools and at Hunter college. Her husband worked on his great book about the failure of communism, Three Who Made a Revolution. In the 1960s, he accepted a job at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, where they became known for their dinner parties attended by many of the great figures of the history of the left in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Ella continued to work for many years, and was still driving at 96.

      "bodyText": "Ella Goldberg Wolfe, who has died aged 103, lived to witness the entire trajectory of communism in the US. Born at Kherson, in the Ukraine, in a time of pogroms, she became a prominent American communist but later moved to the right politically, ending her life in the strongly anti-communist atmosphere of the Hoover Institution on the Stanford university campus in Palo Alto, California; her circle included Robert Conquest, the historian of Stalin's terror, and Edward Teller, \"father of the H-bomb\". Wolfe was brought to the US as a child. In 1910, at the age of 14, she met Bertram D Wolfe at a park tennis court in Brooklyn. He took an instant liking to her, and they were married in 1917, just in time for the October Revolution. They were married for 60 years, until his death in 1977. Barely 5ft tall, Wolfe was striking rather than beautiful, with bright blue eyes that people remembered. She was also steely in her determination, and sharp in repartee. Before the Russian revolution, the Wolfes and their friend John Reed were part of the cultural left in Greenwich Village. In 1919, together with Reed, Bert Wolfe wrote the Left Wing Manifesto, which created the American Communist Party. After the passage of the 1918 sedition act, the 1920s saw the \"Palmer raids\" in which many foreign-born radicals were deported to the Soviet Union. The Wolfes were forced to live clandestinely; they assumed false names and, on several occasions, were almost caught. They hid in New York, San Francisco and Washington, as well as in Mexico City, where they were friends of the great communist mural artist, Diego Rivera, and of Frida Kahlo, the painter, who had been Trotsky's mistress. In the US, they helped the great exiled Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovski and lent him money. He repaid them by putting it about that Ella was his mistress, which she rejected with amusement rather than anger. Wolfe worked as her husband's unpaid secretary and editor. They decided not to have children, so as to free her for work as a revolutionary, something she later said she regretted. In 1929, Bert became a member of the Comintern, and the couple moved to Moscow, where they met Stalin. Years later, Ella described him as \"smaller than I expected, with a pockmarked face, a brutal mouth and the yellow eyes of a mountain lion\". Bert Wolfe angered Stalin by arguing for \"American exceptionalism\". This was the case (made by the section of the American communist movement known as the \"Lovestonites\", after their leader Jay Lovestone) that Marxist-Leninist ideas should not be automatically applied to conditions in the US but should be adapted. This put them at odds not only with the Stalinists but with the Trotskyists. Although both factions in the US together had fewer than 1,000 members, they continued to argue through their journals, the Lovestonites' Workers Age and the Trotskyists' New International. Stalin decided against Bert Wolfe and his \"American exceptionalism\". The Wolfes were probably lucky to survive; if they had fallen out so publicly with Stalin a few years later, during the great purges, they could well have been eliminated. Bert was expelled from the Communist Party and Ella left two years later after refusing to denounce her husband. By the 1940s, after the Nazi-Soviet pact and Hitler's attack on Russia, which turned the Soviet Union into a \"gallant ally\" to America, the Wolfes had left the Lovestone group. Back in America, Wolfe went to college and earned a master's degree in Spanish at Columbia university in New York. This enabled her to teach, which she did in schools and at Hunter college. Her husband worked on his great book about the failure of communism, Three Who Made a Revolution. In the 1960s, he accepted a job at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, where they became known for their dinner parties attended by many of the great figures of the history of the left in the US and Europe. Ella continued to work for many years, and was still driving at 96. By the 1970s, she and her husband had become conservatives, like so many of those around them at Stanford, and even supporters of Ronald Reagan. Ella Wolfe lived to see her third century, and long survived the cause of revolutionary socialism to which she and her husband had given most of their life, but which they had rejected long before the Soviet Union collapsed.

But the technical demands were the least of his worries. In its 18th- and 19th-century heyday, mezzotint was solely a reproductive medium, for copying masters such as Reynolds and Turner.

Publishers from the dailies Fath, Asr-e Azadegan and Sobh-e Emrouz were interrogated behind closed doors, while a fourth newspaper, Azad, was named but no representative appeared before the court, which is a division of the judicial system with special reponsibility for the media. The publishers refused to comment in detail on the proceedings. Lawyers in the case said they expected the papers to be indicted officially at a later date because there was confusion about the precise charges and the crime committed. In Iranian law, there is no specific crime of publishing remarks given by dissidents. However, the newspaper Khordad was closed recently on similar grounds after its publisher, Abdollah Nouri, a protege of Ayatollah Montazeri, defended the cleric in court and demanded that his house arrest be lifted. Mr Nouri was tried for political and religious dissent and sentenced to five years in prison. In the lengthy interview, conducted by fax, Ayatollah Montazeri, who has been under house arrest since November 1997, broke many taboos. He accused the conservative establishment of distorting the spirit of the Islamic Revolution by giving too much power to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and said the supreme leader should be elected by the people instead of being appointed by a handful of clerics. Ayatollah Montazeri, who is considered one of the most learned theologians in Iran, also charged hardliners with holding a \"monopoly\" on political power by limiting the authority of the president, who is elected. The interview, published on Thursday, has prompted a national scandal over Ayatollah Montazeri's call for civil liberties and freedom of expression. It was, therefore, ironic that the press court yesterday took the very action that Ayatollah Montazeri claimed was unconstitutional. His comments that the supreme leader should be elected and not held above the law particularly struck a raw nerve with conservatives. \"We should ask Mr Montazeri if millions of people who are willing to pour into the streets in support of the supreme leader aren't a majority of this nation?\" said the conservative newspaper Kayhan in an editorial.

In a book to be published this month and quoted at length in the media, Dr Veronique Vasseur claimed rats and cockroaches were commonplace, hygiene was non-existent, and brutal rapes and fist fights were daily occurrences. La Sant\u00e9, built in 1867, has 1,200 prisoners and includes a \"VIP wing\" that recently housed the former minister Bernard Tapie. Past inmates include the poets Paul Verlaine and Guillaume Apollinaire. But despite many demands, only two visits by journalists have been permitted in recent years, according to Le Monde. La Sant\u00e9's director, Alain Jego, said the prison was \"changing\", but television cameras showed tiny cells, mouldy showers, and anti-suicide netting across corridors. \"The place remains an inhuman nightmare,\" Dr Vasseur said, \"an eternal shame to France.\"",

      "bodyText": "International efforts to outlaw biological weapons will enter a crucial stage today amid mounting pressure on the US to drop objections to effective verification measures. The EU and non-aligned countries are pushing for a tough treaty that would allow random inspections at a time when the rapid growth in biotechnology poses an increasing threat. Biological weapons are cheap to manufacture (they are sometimes known as the poor man's nuclear bombs) and the quantities needed are much smaller than those needed in chemical warfare already covered by an international convention with an intrusive verification regime. Though they are the easiest weapon of mass destruction to develop, treaties designed to prohibit the use of biological weapons are the weakest. The biological and toxin weapons convention, which came into force in 1975, includes no provision for verification. The EU says it is essential for a new protocol to the convention - the subject of negotiations which start in Geneva today - to force states and companies to declare their production of biological and toxin agents and allow random inspections. EU governments agreed last November that the new protocol \"must include provisions for rapid and effective investigations\". The US has paid little attention to the proposals, mainly, say European sources, because of objections by American biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to on-site inspections. They claim they need protection for reasons of commercial confidentiality. A US congress report noted that \"some biological products are genetically manipulated to develop new commercial products, optimising production and ensuring the integrity of the product, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate commercial activities and offensive military activities\". It added: \"One bacterium strain can represent a large proportion of a company's investment in a pharmaceutical product and thus its potential loss during an arms control monitoring activity could be worth billions of dollars\". Independent US experts familiar with the negotiations say that privately the industry would be prepared to cooperate if forced to do so but is hiding behind the Clinton administration's apparent indifference. Some European observers believe that Washington's lack of interest - despite its public concern about biological weapons in the hands of \"rogue\" states - reflects hostility to international treaties. They point to the US senate's refusal last year to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty, and its attempt to amend the anti-ballistic missile treaty signed by Washington and Moscow in 1972. Stephen Pullinger, director of the British defence think tank Isis, said yesterday that the Geneva talks would be \" a test of US commitment to an effective treaty-based non-proliferation regime\". In a new report, Isis says that official estimates suggest there may be 10 states in possession of biological weapons - Russia, Iraq, China, India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Libya,Taiwan, and Syria. Most of the 60,000 scientists previously involved in biological work in the former USSR, which armed some of its ballistic missiles with anthrax for use against western cities, are now unemployed. Iraq, it says, had developed an extensive biological warfare programme, with 160 aircraft bombs and 25 missile warheads with biological agents discovered after the 1991 Gulf war. It was designing and developing missiles with ranges of up to 3,000km. \"There is an increasing reluctance to rule out nuclear retaliation to the use of biological weapons,\" says Isis. \"An appreciation of the interconnectedness of all weapons of mass destruction means that unless we strengthen the prohibition of biological weapons we are unlikely to prevent further nuclear proliferation\".",

But confidence in US interceptors designed to destroy ballistic warheads has been undermined by the disclosure that their previous performance was not the complete success it appeared to be three months ago. While an interceptor did hit a mock warhead as planned, proving to the satisfaction of its supporters that the system worked, it turned out that this had happened only after the interceptor had drifted off course and homed in on a decoy balloon. \"What this says to me is, if that balloon hadn't been there, then they wouldn't have hit the target,\" said Tom Collina, director of the Arms Control and International Security Programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"They got lucky.\" In a real attack, the number of decoys in space would be unlimited and the warheads would probably be more difficult to see. \"The only thing they demonstrated in this test is that if they can see the warhead, then they can home in with enough precision to hit it,\" said Theodore Postol, a professor of science, technology and national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

      "trailText": "The E-Type was everything a sports car should be: speedy, sleek and sexy. But since then, says  Jonathan Glancey, Jaguar hasn't come close. Until now perhaps . . .",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you must have an E-Type Jaguar, there are several firms that re-manufacture these lithe, feline 60s sports cars. Most are a joy to drive as well as to look at. You get the catwalk looks - the sexiest car ever to take to the road - and an everyday driving machine that offers greater pleasure than 99% of current production sports cars. For the most part, these are too wide, too bulky and too complex to be as much fun as a lither, skittish E-Type. And very few contemporary sports cars have such a compelling see-me, touch-me, feel-me dashboard as an early E-Type, and only Ferraris, Alfas, Porsches and one or two others have such an inspiring engine and addictive exhaust note. Trouble is that, although you can get a decent original E-Type for less than \u00a320,000, a specialist rebuild that will give a modern Jag a race for its money could set you back as much as \u00a380,000. And this, for a Jag - a car traditionally built down to a cost - is pretty silly money.</p> <p>Enter the F-Type, a prototype of a long-awaited successor to the E-Type. The shapely roadster you see here is very likely to make it into production and, if it does, to cost around \u00a335,000. For that, Jaguar offers a car that promises to be eye-catching, rapid and closer in spirit to the great Coventry cats of the Le Mans winning days of the legendary C- and D-Types of the 50s than any since the original E-Type which went on sale, crudely under-developed, in 1961.</p> <p>It does look good. It has most of the key elements that have made a Jag a Jag since William Lyons, founder of the company now owned by Ford, and his aerodynamicist, Malcolm Sayers, stamped their mark on saloon and sports cars alike: a high waistline, tall wheels tucked well up into swooping, voluptuous bodywork, pert, boat-like tails, aggressively curved front wings that appear to be pawing their way through the air with the grace, pace and muscularity of a big cat. The design of the cars has long meant to match the name of the marque. A Jaguar, if it's to be the real thing, must evoke the spirit of the great American predator that once sprung - until safety legislation culled it - from their bonnets. Jaguar has never needed to ape the forms of the past, but has used them instead as a kind of design resource or archive. The E-Type looked shockingly new 30 years ago, yet, if you looked closely, it was clearly spawned from Sayer's magnificent track-bound Spitfire, the 180mph D-Type.</p> <p>Even more happily, Keith Helflet, the F-Type's designer, has suggested an interior - more of a cockpit really - free of the opulent, mirror-finish wood veneer and lumpen, funereal plastics that have spoiled so many Jaguars under Ford's ownership. Whilst Jag's trademark wood and leather interiors are part-and-parcel of its saloon cars (overblown in the competent yet grossly overstyled S-series saloon), they were never a feature of its sports cars - as they were never in such rivals as the fastest Aston-Martins and Ferraris.</p> <p>The dashes of sporting Jags were elegant, aircraft-functional designs with big, clear white-on-black Smith's dials, elongated rows of black, plastic-coated toggle switches, black paint, leather-cloth and textured aluminium.

      "bodyText": "If you must have an E-Type Jaguar, there are several firms that re-manufacture these lithe, feline 60s sports cars. Most are a joy to drive as well as to look at. You get the catwalk looks - the sexiest car ever to take to the road - and an everyday driving machine that offers greater pleasure than 99% of current production sports cars. For the most part, these are too wide, too bulky and too complex to be as much fun as a lither, skittish E-Type. And very few contemporary sports cars have such a compelling see-me, touch-me, feel-me dashboard as an early E-Type, and only Ferraris, Alfas, Porsches and one or two others have such an inspiring engine and addictive exhaust note. Trouble is that, although you can get a decent original E-Type for less than \u00a320,000, a specialist rebuild that will give a modern Jag a race for its money could set you back as much as \u00a380,000. And this, for a Jag - a car traditionally built down to a cost - is pretty silly money. Enter the F-Type, a prototype of a long-awaited successor to the E-Type. The shapely roadster you see here is very likely to make it into production and, if it does, to cost around \u00a335,000. For that, Jaguar offers a car that promises to be eye-catching, rapid and closer in spirit to the great Coventry cats of the Le Mans winning days of the legendary C- and D-Types of the 50s than any since the original E-Type which went on sale, crudely under-developed, in 1961. It does look good. It has most of the key elements that have made a Jag a Jag since William Lyons, founder of the company now owned by Ford, and his aerodynamicist, Malcolm Sayers, stamped their mark on saloon and sports cars alike: a high waistline, tall wheels tucked well up into swooping, voluptuous bodywork, pert, boat-like tails, aggressively curved front wings that appear to be pawing their way through the air with the grace, pace and muscularity of a big cat. The design of the cars has long meant to match the name of the marque. A Jaguar, if it's to be the real thing, must evoke the spirit of the great American predator that once sprung - until safety legislation culled it - from their bonnets. Jaguar has never needed to ape the forms of the past, but has used them instead as a kind of design resource or archive. The E-Type looked shockingly new 30 years ago, yet, if you looked closely, it was clearly spawned from Sayer's magnificent track-bound Spitfire, the 180mph D-Type. Even more happily, Keith Helflet, the F-Type's designer, has suggested an interior - more of a cockpit really - free of the opulent, mirror-finish wood veneer and lumpen, funereal plastics that have spoiled so many Jaguars under Ford's ownership. Whilst Jag's trademark wood and leather interiors are part-and-parcel of its saloon cars (overblown in the competent yet grossly overstyled S-series saloon), they were never a feature of its sports cars - as they were never in such rivals as the fastest Aston-Martins and Ferraris. The dashes of sporting Jags were elegant, aircraft-functional designs with big, clear white-on-black Smith's dials, elongated rows of black, plastic-coated toggle switches, black paint, leather-cloth and textured aluminium. Heflet's F-Type dash is not quite right - it looks a little fey and fiddly - yet it's imbued with the right feel. Hopefully, if (and most probably when) the car goes on sale, it will boast a more subtle and purposeful set of instruments and switchgear.

And not for the first time.</p> <p>The professional body that regulates and represents 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales might seem unpromising cabaret material, but in the space of a few turbulent years the Law Society has seen one of its official presidential candidates forced to stand down after being revealed as a groper, a massive surge in complaints about solicitors and the near-collapse of its procedures for handling the grievances, and an almost ceaseless tide of bitter in-fighting first unleashed in the time of one Martin Mears, a maverick who exploded on to the scene as president in 1995, and has never really gone away.</p> <p>For the latest instalment of the saga at Chancery Lane we must look back to the summer of 1998. It was a heady time. Behind the neo-classical Ionic columns that guard the splendid headquarters of the Law Society there was a spirit of great optimism abroad. At last, it was about to banish its dusty, fusty, white, middle-aged-male image.</p> <p>A woman was elected for the first time as one of the leaders of the massively male-dominated society - and not only that, she was an Asian. Kamlesh Bahl was, as one council member put it, \"manna from heaven\". She was a public relations dream come true. What's more, if all went according to plan, in July 2000 she would become the first woman, and the first from an ethnic minority, to become president of the society. Shortly before Christmas, the dream went sour. Two formal complaints were lodged against Bahl, alleging she had bullied one senior member of staff - head of policy Russell Wallman - and one ex-employee. The allegations, which are unprecedented at the Chancery Lane headquarters, were brought under the society's dignity at work policy introduced two years ago to provide redress for staff who feel they have suffered \"harassment, bullying or victimisation\" at work.</p> <p>The full detail of the allegations has not been made public, but a retired law lord, Lord Griffiths, has been appointed to head an investigation into the affair which is due to start hearing evidence next month.</p> <p>But it doesn't stop there. Following the two initial complaints, a number of further allegations of bullying or harassment were made to MSF - the trade union representing staff at the Law Society. And among those said to be have been unhappy at Bahl's behaviour is the Law Society's most senior bureaucrat, secretary general Jane Betts.</p> <p>About 10 people provided further evidence to a committee set up within the Law Society to consider any other additional grievances from staff who were given until last Friday to come forward. It is due to report developments - behind closed doors, though it will inevitably leak - during the private session of the next full council meeting on Thursday.</p> <p>Things would be bad enough if they stopped there - but true to the Law Society's spiralling soap-style storylines, it gets worse.</p> <p>It emerged last week that Bahl, 43, has lodged her own formal complaint against - wait for it - the president, Robert Sayer. In a four-page letter from her lawyers, she accused him of \"unfitting and inappropriate\" conduct, alleging that he tried to make her leave the premises. Sayer, 47, had, the letter claimed, \"threatened and intimidated\" Bahl, who apparently brought her sister and her mother into the office to provide physical or moral support.</p> <p>Bahl has stood her ground since, continuing to turn up to work in what must be extraordinarily strained circumstances and attracting the support of organisations including the Society of Black Lawyers, which argues she may be the victim of a campaign aimed at blocking her from becoming the first Asian woman president.</p> <p>Bahl's enemies at the Law Society should not underestimate her. She is convinced she can persuade an independent arbiter she has behaved perfectly properly. After all, she was brought in as a new broom to change the way in which the Law Society operates - it was inevitable she would put a few noses out of joint. And she has proved she can weather tough times. As chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, she has already been at the centre of allegations of bullying, which she strenuously denies.</p> <p>More than a dozen members of staff were unhappy about her management style - some, it was claimed, took time off sick with depression or stress-related illness.</p> <p>The complaints were never proved. Employees requested redeployment rather than pursue their complaints - some left altogether, one took a secondment.</p> <p>Her past may come back to haunt her. The Law Society's solicitors, Bindman and Partners, are understood to be seeking evidence on events at the EOC ready for Lord Griffiths' inquiry. Last week a former press officer at the EOC, who did not want to be named, recalled: \"Kamlesh would come in - she never really had a grasp of etiquette or politeness, and she would single out members of staff and just start berating them, picking on aspects of their work, shouting at them in front of other members of staff\".</p> <p>Opinion among the membership of the 75-strong Law Society council is divided. \"I've been in partnership in business, and an employer, and it's quite likely you could upset somebody and get one complaint. But two, three, four, five, six? From different places? It makes you think, doesn't it?\" is one view.</p> <p>One council member claimed to have seen Bahl treating staff inappropriately.\"I've seen her humiliating very senior staff members at the Law Society in public and in front of their junior colleagues. The woman has not got a clue about how to manage people. What I would like to see happening - whatever the outcome of the allegations - is that she stands down.\"</p> <p>Another, former president Martin Mears, is more sceptical about the allegations: \"I've known Kamlesh Bahl for the past five years.

It's terribly damaging to the Law Society and to Kamlesh Bahl.\"</p> <p>\"The whole thing is a pitiful spectacle,\" he elaborates in the latest New Law Journal. \"A vice-president who, if she has behaved badly, could only have done so through the torpor or acquiescence of those around her; a secretary general, who, in relation to the Law Society's staff and its grievances, should have been in charge, but who instead has been swept along by the tide of events; a president who, in his general handling of the fiasco has made himself and the Law Society look ridiculous.\"</p> <p>In contrast to his contempt for the society's role in the affair, Mears is full of admiration for Bahl. \"She does not lose her self-possession, does not get upset. She's a woman of some calibre.

This would be a huge mistake for the party and for London. And it would play into the hands of the Tories, who would love Ken to be our candidate.</p> <p>I urge all party members to focus on what really matters - the candidates' policies, their qualities and experience. It is not surprising that the media has focused on personalities and process. But it is disappointing that there has been so little discussion of what needs to be done in London to reduce poverty, solve transport problems and improve the quality of education and healthcare.</p> <p>Frank has lived and worked in London all his life and brought up his family there. He knows the city, its strengths and its problems.

      "bodyText": "Labour party members in London will get their ballot papers for the candidate for mayor in two weeks. They then have a further two weeks to cast their vote. I strongly support Frank Dobson for mayor. I have known Frank for years, politically and as a good friend. He is radical and egalitarian, with a big heart and a hard head. He would be a great mayor. However, I fear that some party members, disgruntled by the imperfect process, the pressure and the spinning, will select Ken Livingstone as a protest vote. This would be a huge mistake for the party and for London. And it would play into the hands of the Tories, who would love Ken to be our candidate. I urge all party members to focus on what really matters - the candidates' policies, their qualities and experience. It is not surprising that the media has focused on personalities and process. But it is disappointing that there has been so little discussion of what needs to be done in London to reduce poverty, solve transport problems and improve the quality of education and healthcare. Frank has lived and worked in London all his life and brought up his family there. He knows the city, its strengths and its problems. He has been a tremendously hard-working, dedicated, popular London MP.

      "body": "<p>GTech, the controversial US gaming group, is back on board British operator Camelot's bid to renew its national lottery licence until 2008, it was announced yesterday. </p> <p>It is thought GTech's expertise as a software supplier outweighed any damage its presence might do to Camelot's application. </p> <p>By re-engaging GTech, Camelot is underlining its determination to have its bid treated on its own merits as an operator of one of the world's biggest lotteries rather than on grounds of public relations or \"image\". </p> <p>It is thought the consortium will demand judicial review of any adverse decision that ignores its achievements simply because of past embarrassments. </p> <p>GTech, based in Rhode Island, was responsible for Camelot's darkest hour when, in 1998, a high court jury decided chairman Guy Snowden had tried to bribe entrepreneur Richard Branson not to make his Virgin group a bidder for the first lottery franchise in autumn 1994. </p> <p>GTech sold its shares in Camelot and Mr Snowden resigned. </p> <p>In the present bidding round GTech is not listed as a shareholder but it will be one of the main suppliers, alongside computer group Compaq and Scientific Games, the expert in \"instant\" lottery scratchcards. </p> <p>Tim Holley, Camelot's chief executive, said: \"We are extremely proud to be able to announce that GTech and Scientific Games have signed up to bid. They are both world leaders in their fields and their contribution will be crucial to continuing to run an efficient and successful lottery.\" </p> <p>Camelot's shareholders are food and drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes, electronics group Racal and security printer De La Rue (with 26.7% each) and computer group ICL (with the balance). The Post Office will take a 20% stake should the bid be successful, and the existing shareholders will shrink their stakes to accommodate it. </p> <p>That, however, might be unnecessary should the agreed \u00a31.32bn bid for Racal from Thomson-CSF, France's electronics group, go ahead; under Camelot's charter a change in control of one shareholder permits the others first refusal on its stake. </p> <p>GTech claims to have won 80% of all online lottery contracts worldwide since 1996. </p> <p>The 1998 court case effectively asked jurors to arbitrate between Mr Snowden and the then Mr Branson, who claimed the former had tried to bribe him. Mr Branson had submitted his own bid to run the lottery on a non-profit basis, and Mr Snowden had apparently feared the Virgin chief's public popularity would win the day. </p> <p>After Mr Branson's courtroom triumph, in which he won damages of \u00a3100,000, the Camelot consortium's remaining shareholders paid \u00a351m for GTech's stake. </p> <p>However, regulators ruled in April 1998 that GTech remained \"fit and proper\" to act as a supplier to the lottery operator, a ruling that will apply for the new licence, due to be awarded in June and to take effect from September 2001.</p>",

By re-engaging GTech, Camelot is underlining its determination to have its bid treated on its own merits as an operator of one of the world's biggest lotteries rather than on grounds of public relations or \"image\". It is thought the consortium will demand judicial review of any adverse decision that ignores its achievements simply because of past embarrassments. GTech, based in Rhode Island, was responsible for Camelot's darkest hour when, in 1998, a high court jury decided chairman Guy Snowden had tried to bribe entrepreneur Richard Branson not to make his Virgin group a bidder for the first lottery franchise in autumn 1994. GTech sold its shares in Camelot and Mr Snowden resigned. In the present bidding round GTech is not listed as a shareholder but it will be one of the main suppliers, alongside computer group Compaq and Scientific Games, the expert in \"instant\" lottery scratchcards. Tim Holley, Camelot's chief executive, said: \"We are extremely proud to be able to announce that GTech and Scientific Games have signed up to bid. They are both world leaders in their fields and their contribution will be crucial to continuing to run an efficient and successful lottery.\" Camelot's shareholders are food and drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes, electronics group Racal and security printer De La Rue (with 26.7% each) and computer group ICL (with the balance). The Post Office will take a 20% stake should the bid be successful, and the existing shareholders will shrink their stakes to accommodate it. That, however, might be unnecessary should the agreed \u00a31.32bn bid for Racal from Thomson-CSF, France's electronics group, go ahead; under Camelot's charter a change in control of one shareholder permits the others first refusal on its stake. GTech claims to have won 80% of all online lottery contracts worldwide since 1996. The 1998 court case effectively asked jurors to arbitrate between Mr Snowden and the then Mr Branson, who claimed the former had tried to bribe him. Mr Branson had submitted his own bid to run the lottery on a non-profit basis, and Mr Snowden had apparently feared the Virgin chief's public popularity would win the day. After Mr Branson's courtroom triumph, in which he won damages of \u00a3100,000, the Camelot consortium's remaining shareholders paid \u00a351m for GTech's stake. However, regulators ruled in April 1998 that GTech remained \"fit and proper\" to act as a supplier to the lottery operator, a ruling that will apply for the new licence, due to be awarded in June and to take effect from September 2001.",

      "body": "<p>In a prismatic, white dressing- room in the backstage labyrinth of the Royal Opera House, the Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova - here to star in the forthcoming Clemenza di Tito - is talking about sex and singing. I'd just asked her whether she'd ever sung Carmen. She shakes her head. Would she ever sing it? Well, maybe, perhaps, in time, if she found the right director. \"The new generation of singers has to wait a while before the opera can be done differently,\" she adds. \"Carmen is an emancipated woman. She's not a prostitute. She's an erotic woman who knows what she wants. Eroticism is something you must feel. It doesn't come from here,\" she went on, touching her abdomen, \"or here\" [she thrusts her breasts forward]. \"It's got to be more -more - \"</p> <p>\"Suggestive?\" I essay.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" she says. </p> <p>Suddenly she draws herself up and launches into the opening bars of the Habanera with the full-throttle, bosomy tone with which many singers of an earlier generation approached the role. \"That's not right. It must be like this.\" Her eyes widening, she sings the same bit again, this time with the quintessential Kasarova sound - dark, restrained, sexual, somewhere between honey and molasses. The phrase slides down like some unearthly sonic caress. </p> <p>Doing things differently, a flawless integration of technique and drama, and a tangible, though subtle, sexuality are very much part of Kasarova's style. I last heard her in Berlin, two years ago, as Charlotte in a semi-staged version of Massenet's Werther. Charlotte - who puts bourgeois values above passion and lives to regret it - is usually portrayed onstage as a prude. \"That's not what's in the music,\" says Kasarova - and it wasn't in her performance, either. She swept on in a clingy, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 black number (\"I was four months pregnant at the time,\") and proceeded to chart, with unerring vocal and psychological accuracy, what she politely describes as \"Charlotte's development from a girl into a woman.\" </p> <p>It was one of those performances you just don't forget. Gone were all the usual insipid associations with burgeoning Romanticism (the opera, premiered in 1892, is based on Goethe's novel). In their place was something more contemporary, a being closer to a character from Ibsen or Zola - manipulative, teetering on the edge of neurosis, yet also vulnerable, tragic and intensely moving. As I watched Werther - played by the late Alfredo Kraus, whom Kasarova deeply admired - turn to jelly in front of this complex creature, the opera seemed suddenly to make perfect sense. </p> <p>Kasarova's astounding allure has a Dietrich-like, androgynous quality, capable of transcending gender and orientation. She makes a credible bloke on stage. When she appeared as Rossini's Tancredi at Carnegie Hall, the critic of the New York Times swooningly compared her with Leonardo DiCaprio. Roles written initially for castrati, and \"trouser roles\", such as Mozart's Idamante and Bellini's Romeo, make up roughly half her repertoire. In New York, in October, she's going to add the lustily adolescent Octavian from Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier to the list. She likes playing chaps. \"They get the best music, and it's harder to be a man than a woman,\" she remarked, giggling. \"You can't be stereotypical, it can't be like this,\" and she flexes her arms in an attitude of Schwarzenegger-like masculinity. </p> <p>She's back at Covent Garden after a seven-year absence to play her favourite man, Sesto, in Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito. The work's erotic and emotional dynamics are remarkable, and one wonders just what she will bring to them. Sesto is torn in two by his feelings for Tito, his friend and emperor, and the glamorously neurotic Vitellia, who wants Tito dead. In the opera's world, \"love\" is the word used to define relationships between men. What characterises the interaction between men and women is something altogether more driven and unnameable. </p> <p>\"Mozart understood people,\" says Kasarova. \"He allows people to express feelings quietly. The surface is elegant, but underneath it's very dark. I like that.\" The production - \"it's incredibly theatrical\" - comes from Salzburg, which she regards as her musical home. In 1991 she caused a sensation there when she took over the role of Tancredi from Marilyn Horne at short notice. She brushes aside my remark that she became a star overnight. \"I don't know whether it was a great success or not,\" she says. \"I thought I was mad to do it.\" </p> <p>Before that turning point, however, came years of hard graft. She was born in the central Bulgarian town of Stara Zagora, trained as a pianist before turning to singing, and left Bulgaria for the west in 1989. The rumours that shadow her, of a dramatic flight from an oppressive regime, seem unfounded. An invitation to Switzerland came from Zurich, where, for two years, she was part of the opera house ensemble. She admits that the communist sys tem encouraged her. \"There are two worlds - there and here,\" she says, as if the old east were still very much a reality for her. \"There, it was very intensive if you wanted to do sport or music. I had music lessons every day for five years. Here, it's different. There are singers who don't make it simply because they have no money.\" A look of sadness crosses her face. </p> <p>As she talks, I realise that the rigorous discipline cultivated in those early years continues to drive her, and that this astonishing woman still, in some ways, regards herself as a student. \"One should always learn,\" she said. \"We singers [she uses those words a lot] can learn so much from other artists, learn from actors and cinema - but we must never copy. It's all a combination of acting, singing and your own personality. It's got to be part of you - and it's got to be natural. You must never pose. An audience will always notice if you pose. You need to build up a career carefully. It's always important to be part of an ensemble.\" </p> <p>It was during her ensemble years in Zurich that Kasarova met her husband-to-be, Roger, who, along with their one-year-old son, Yves Lucien, is with her in London. Her face is radiant with pleasure and affection when I mention him. \"Artists are always whingeing,\" she laughs. \"Their partners have to put up with a lot. They need good nerves. I'm very lucky.\" </p> <p>The candour and emotional frankness that characterise her singing spill into her words. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all about Kasarova is the fact that, after years of being a star - and she's unquestionably that - she remains unaffected, unspoilt, modest and generous to her colleagues. </p> <p>\"Singers are all just different,\" she says. \"You wouldn't want to hear the same singer all the time, would you?\" Perhaps, if they were all like her, I would. </p> <p><em>La Clemenza di Tito opens at the Royal Opera House on January 22. Box office: 0171-304 4000.</em></p>",

Well, maybe, perhaps, in time, if she found the right director. \"The new generation of singers has to wait a while before the opera can be done differently,\" she adds. \"Carmen is an emancipated woman. She's not a prostitute. She's an erotic woman who knows what she wants. Eroticism is something you must feel. It doesn't come from here,\" she went on, touching her abdomen, \"or here\" [she thrusts her breasts forward]. \"It's got to be more -more - \" \"Suggestive?\" I essay. \"Yes,\" she says. Suddenly she draws herself up and launches into the opening bars of the Habanera with the full-throttle, bosomy tone with which many singers of an earlier generation approached the role. \"That's not right. It must be like this.\" Her eyes widening, she sings the same bit again, this time with the quintessential Kasarova sound - dark, restrained, sexual, somewhere between honey and molasses. The phrase slides down like some unearthly sonic caress. Doing things differently, a flawless integration of technique and drama, and a tangible, though subtle, sexuality are very much part of Kasarova's style. I last heard her in Berlin, two years ago, as Charlotte in a semi-staged version of Massenet's Werther. Charlotte - who puts bourgeois values above passion and lives to regret it - is usually portrayed onstage as a prude. \"That's not what's in the music,\" says Kasarova - and it wasn't in her performance, either. She swept on in a clingy, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 black number (\"I was four months pregnant at the time,\") and proceeded to chart, with unerring vocal and psychological accuracy, what she politely describes as \"Charlotte's development from a girl into a woman.\" It was one of those performances you just don't forget. Gone were all the usual insipid associations with burgeoning Romanticism (the opera, premiered in 1892, is based on Goethe's novel). In their place was something more contemporary, a being closer to a character from Ibsen or Zola - manipulative, teetering on the edge of neurosis, yet also vulnerable, tragic and intensely moving. As I watched Werther - played by the late Alfredo Kraus, whom Kasarova deeply admired - turn to jelly in front of this complex creature, the opera seemed suddenly to make perfect sense. Kasarova's astounding allure has a Dietrich-like, androgynous quality, capable of transcending gender and orientation. She makes a credible bloke on stage. When she appeared as Rossini's Tancredi at Carnegie Hall, the critic of the New York Times swooningly compared her with Leonardo DiCaprio. Roles written initially for castrati, and \"trouser roles\", such as Mozart's Idamante and Bellini's Romeo, make up roughly half her repertoire. In New York, in October, she's going to add the lustily adolescent Octavian from Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier to the list. She likes playing chaps. \"They get the best music, and it's harder to be a man than a woman,\" she remarked, giggling. \"You can't be stereotypical, it can't be like this,\" and she flexes her arms in an attitude of Schwarzenegger-like masculinity. She's back at Covent Garden after a seven-year absence to play her favourite man, Sesto, in Mozart's La Clemenza di Tito. The work's erotic and emotional dynamics are remarkable, and one wonders just what she will bring to them. Sesto is torn in two by his feelings for Tito, his friend and emperor, and the glamorously neurotic Vitellia, who wants Tito dead. In the opera's world, \"love\" is the word used to define relationships between men. What characterises the interaction between men and women is something altogether more driven and unnameable. \"Mozart understood people,\" says Kasarova. \"He allows people to express feelings quietly. The surface is elegant, but underneath it's very dark. I like that.\" The production - \"it's incredibly theatrical\" - comes from Salzburg, which she regards as her musical home. In 1991 she caused a sensation there when she took over the role of Tancredi from Marilyn Horne at short notice. She brushes aside my remark that she became a star overnight. \"I don't know whether it was a great success or not,\" she says. \"I thought I was mad to do it.\" Before that turning point, however, came years of hard graft. She was born in the central Bulgarian town of Stara Zagora, trained as a pianist before turning to singing, and left Bulgaria for the west in 1989. The rumours that shadow her, of a dramatic flight from an oppressive regime, seem unfounded. An invitation to Switzerland came from Zurich, where, for two years, she was part of the opera house ensemble. She admits that the communist sys tem encouraged her. \"There are two worlds - there and here,\" she says, as if the old east were still very much a reality for her. \"There, it was very intensive if you wanted to do sport or music. I had music lessons every day for five years. Here, it's different. There are singers who don't make it simply because they have no money.\" A look of sadness crosses her face. As she talks, I realise that the rigorous discipline cultivated in those early years continues to drive her, and that this astonishing woman still, in some ways, regards herself as a student. \"One should always learn,\" she said. \"We singers [she uses those words a lot] can learn so much from other artists, learn from actors and cinema - but we must never copy. It's all a combination of acting, singing and your own personality. It's got to be part of you - and it's got to be natural. You must never pose. An audience will always notice if you pose. You need to build up a career carefully. It's always important to be part of an ensemble.\" It was during her ensemble years in Zurich that Kasarova met her husband-to-be, Roger, who, along with their one-year-old son, Yves Lucien, is with her in London. Her face is radiant with pleasure and affection when I mention him. \"Artists are always whingeing,\" she laughs. \"Their partners have to put up with a lot. They need good nerves. I'm very lucky.\" The candour and emotional frankness that characterise her singing spill into her words. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all about Kasarova is the fact that, after years of being a star - and she's unquestionably that - she remains unaffected, unspoilt, modest and generous to her colleagues. \"Singers are all just different,\" she says. \"You wouldn't want to hear the same singer all the time, would you?\" Perhaps, if they were all like her, I would. La Clemenza di Tito opens at the Royal Opera House on January 22. Box office: 0171-304 4000.",

We owe this civic magnificence and what appears to be a new-found faith in the public realm to a spirited team of engineers, contractors, builders and project managers, but mostly to Roland Romano Paoletti, the Italian architect who came to London from Hong Kong (where he had done much to shape the impressively efficient new metro) to lead the JLE design team - to be, in effect, both its chief architect and its client. This year, his decade-long project completed, Paoletti plans to return to Lucca, in Italy. His paternal family has lived there for at least 700 years; he is named Romano after a local church.</p> <p>As a nation we have just honoured Paoletti with a CBE. But how can we realistically value the contribution of this cultured, deeply intelligent man who, despite near-overwhelming bureaucracy and all the dismal talk of privatisation and private finance initiatives, has steered through a public project of the very highest order? \"It's an incredible achievement,\" says Richard Rogers. \"You can get great things done in England, but the effort can be crippling. Roland is a very particular and special guy.\"</p> <p>Born to an Italian father and Franco-Italian mother (with Hungarian blood in the mix somewhere) in the long-since demolished City of London hospital, Paoletti was evacuated to Scotland and then, in 1942, to Ireland.

He trained as an architect in Manchester before coming to London to work for Basil Spence, architect of Coventry cathedral, on the design of the much-delayed British embassy in Rome. Two of the architects he was later to employ on the JLE, Michael Hopkins and Richard MacCormac, worked for Spence at that time. \"We never met,\" says MacCormac. \"I was a glorified tea-boy at the time, while Michael and Roland worked in separate buildings; Spence's was a large office with a big throughput of bright young things.\"</p> <p>Paoletti left Spence's office, and England, in 1960, not to return in a professional capacity for 30 years. He went first to pursue post-graduate studies at the University of Venice. Here, he learned from such inspired and original architects as Carlo Scarpa, Ignacio Gardella, Giancarlo De Carlo and Ernesto Rogers, uncle of Lord Rogers of Riverside. At this time Le Corbusier was working on his final project, a city hospital for Venice. It was never built, yet its design came to haunt architects of Paoletti's generation.</p> <p>\"Le Corbusier came to the university to explain the scheme to us,\" Paoletti recalls. \"What he showed us was not so much a building as a system of thought. The idea was for a hospital that was also a kind of sanitorium, like Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain. People might come to die here, but it would be in great dignity, with views of ships and with their bedrooms set above the purely mechanical working of the hospital.\"</p> <p>Ever since, Paoletti has thought of architecture in terms of humane and civilising systems. What he wanted to learn was how to build, how to engineer as well as design, how to think through architecture and construction in the round. He was taken on by his hero, the engineer-architect Pierluigi Nervi. The sublime Canary Wharf JLE station, the result of much enjoyable discussion between Paoletti and David Nelson of Foster and Partners, is clearly a homage to Nervi, resembling his greatest work (airship hangars and sports stadia steeped in the spirit of Rome, yet making optimum use of new materials and technology) as seen through a lens that has been cut and polished in the 90s. Nervi sent Paoletti to Brazil, where he worked on the Italian embassy in Brasilia. This proved to be a long-delayed, frustrating project. In 1975, Hong Kong beckoned and, over 12 years, Paoletti designed no fewer than 37 brutally functional, faultless stations and three depots.</p> <p>Here was \"systems architecture\" on a city-wide scale. It worked with peerless efficiency and was his passport to the JLE, via Wilfred Newton, chief accountant of the Hong Kong Mass Transit Authority, who was appointed chairman of the ailing London Transport in 1990. Putting together his own JLE team, Paoletti brought in some of the best British architects from outside London Transport, and was able to draw up 11 sets of working drawings and tenders within three years. He locked these into binding contracts, so that by the time John Major gave the project the go-ahead in October 1993, the heroic scale of the stations was inviolate. But he had to fight every inch of the way between Westminster and Stratford. \"I had to go down on my knees and beg the architects to design a station for me,\" he says. \"They were suspicious.\"</p> <p>\"In hindsight, it sounds like dreadful behaviour,\" says Richard MacCormac of MacCormac Jamie son Prichard, architects of the magical Southwark station, \"but we were used to a London Underground run on the design side by pretty insensitive engineers who appeared to think architects were there to add some coloured tiles to their tunnels - what Norman Foster once called 'putting lipstick on the face of a gorilla'. Roland convinced us otherwise.\"</p> <p>In fact, the architects came to produce some of their finest work, with Paoletti as client and collaborator. Michael Hopkins's ugly Portcullis House (\"In my opinion, self-indulgent,\" says Paoletti) in Westminster is redeemed by the magnificence of the pure-engineering- style station he has threaded through its complex foundations (\"A balance,\" suggests Paoletti, \"as happy as that achieved at St Pancras by the architect Gilbert Scott and the engineer Barlow\"). </p> <p>Paoletti's own Jubilee line stations, Waterloo and London Bridge (with Weston Williamson), are handsome arrangements of grand passageways and undercrofts.

      "body": "<p>Networking was one of the buzzwords of the 1990s, as people increasingly realised that who you know can have an impact on your career. But there is more to networking than trying to meet important people at parties; other secretaries and support staff are useful contacts as well. They may not necessarily be able to get you a better job, but sharing expertise or discussing common frustrations can be extremely encouraging in realising you are not the only PA to struggle with a difficult boss and a lack of recognition. In an industry not known in general for mobilising on professional grounds, the signs are that workers within the secretarial sector are increasingly getting together. </p> <p>Marjory Mair is head of secretarial and administrative development at the Industrial Society. She actively encourages secretaries and PAs to share expertise, seeing it as a vital coping skill: \"The job is getting tougher, there are higher expectations with more demanded of PAs then ever before. Keeping up with technology can be a challenge and the whole thing about knowledge sharing is something which is a must in order to stay ahead.\" </p> <p>Secretarial networking has in the past been limited largely to a few pro fessional associations. Their membership base is usually defined by subject area or level of qualified expertise, and they can be extremely selective about who is admitted to their circle. </p> <p>With a membership of 3,000 and 13 regional branches, the Institute of Qualified Private Secretaries (IQPS) is the largest professional body for secretaries, PAs and general administrators. Membership is through invitation, and based on a high level of qualification or lengthy senior experience. </p> <p>Cynthia Desmond has been a member for nearly 20 years: \"It gives you backup and the companionship of like-minded people. We are able to contact each other to find out about things; if it's something you don't know, somebody else in the organisation will.\" Other professional bodies, for workers in specialised sectors such as the medical, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, fulfil the same role. </p> <p>But other networking initiatives are on the increase. PA Exchange is the brainchild of Susan Bollond, PA to the chief executive of the Edinburgh international conference centre. \"I set it up to be more informal and accessible,\" says Bollond. \"We probably meet about three times a year, getting to know each other.\" With one eye still kept firmly on business, Bollond organises visits to top venues so that members can select the appropriate ones when organising their employers' corporate events. </p> <p>Important as these large-scale initiatives are, getting together with colleagues within your company specifically to discuss shared work concerns can be enormously encouraging for support staff - and can get results. The internet company Nortel is a good example.

      "bodyText": "Networking was one of the buzzwords of the 1990s, as people increasingly realised that who you know can have an impact on your career. But there is more to networking than trying to meet important people at parties; other secretaries and support staff are useful contacts as well. They may not necessarily be able to get you a better job, but sharing expertise or discussing common frustrations can be extremely encouraging in realising you are not the only PA to struggle with a difficult boss and a lack of recognition. In an industry not known in general for mobilising on professional grounds, the signs are that workers within the secretarial sector are increasingly getting together. Marjory Mair is head of secretarial and administrative development at the Industrial Society. She actively encourages secretaries and PAs to share expertise, seeing it as a vital coping skill: \"The job is getting tougher, there are higher expectations with more demanded of PAs then ever before. Keeping up with technology can be a challenge and the whole thing about knowledge sharing is something which is a must in order to stay ahead.\" Secretarial networking has in the past been limited largely to a few pro fessional associations. Their membership base is usually defined by subject area or level of qualified expertise, and they can be extremely selective about who is admitted to their circle. With a membership of 3,000 and 13 regional branches, the Institute of Qualified Private Secretaries (IQPS) is the largest professional body for secretaries, PAs and general administrators. Membership is through invitation, and based on a high level of qualification or lengthy senior experience. Cynthia Desmond has been a member for nearly 20 years: \"It gives you backup and the companionship of like-minded people. We are able to contact each other to find out about things; if it's something you don't know, somebody else in the organisation will.\" Other professional bodies, for workers in specialised sectors such as the medical, pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, fulfil the same role. But other networking initiatives are on the increase. PA Exchange is the brainchild of Susan Bollond, PA to the chief executive of the Edinburgh international conference centre. \"I set it up to be more informal and accessible,\" says Bollond. \"We probably meet about three times a year, getting to know each other.\" With one eye still kept firmly on business, Bollond organises visits to top venues so that members can select the appropriate ones when organising their employers' corporate events. Important as these large-scale initiatives are, getting together with colleagues within your company specifically to discuss shared work concerns can be enormously encouraging for support staff - and can get results. The internet company Nortel is a good example. When its annual survey registered strong dissatisfaction among secretarial and support staff, the managing director got the company's secretaries together. Their main gripe was lack of entitlement to private medical insurance which was available to the rest of the company, and a feeling that they were not being recognised as part of the team. Shortly after, they evolved into a network called the \"Hub\". Kim Taylor is Hub's chair. \"We have quarterly meetings for members to get together and we provide training that helps support staff to develop,\" she says. \"It's especially good for new people in the company, who can find out what they need to know. I have developed myself, not only my career.\" Members have benefited from sharing ideas and learning various new skills. Better still, they got their private health insurance.

      "body": "<p>There are people out there with designs on your body. You thought it was just you who wanted to be fit and heathy, rippling and raring to go (to work). But no - your boss also wants you to be fitter, less stressed and healthier. Recent years have seen a huge rise in awareness of occupational health, as UK managers cotton on to the idea that a healthier workforce on the office floor equals a wealthier outcome in the annual report. </p> <p>Employers keen to keep their workforce happy in mind, body and spirit now provide anything from massage to ease away aches and pains to tai chi, football, hockey and aerobics classes. From onsite gyms and subsidised gym membership to informal encouragements to get active, there are endless opportunities for staff to run, jog and cycle away the stresses of corporate life. </p> <p>We are even beginning to expect this type of facility at work. According to a report from the Institute of Management, more than one in five say their organisations provide sports and leisure facilities and another third want this type of facility. Mark Hastings, the institute's head of policy, is refreshingly direct in his assessment of the reasons for this people-centred focus: \"Companies used to worry about getting bigger and better machines. Now they have been replaced as an issue by people. Deadlines are important and employers haven't got the extra staff anymore to take up the slack. When someone is off sick, it is not just a problem for them but the rest of the team as well.\" </p> <p>Diane Sinclair, adviser at the Institute of Personnel and Development, agrees. \"The most important aspect of employee management is that employees are present and fit to work - they are not much use if they are not there.\" Apart from the cost of absenteeism, she says, companies with healthier workers can save on insurance costs and on litigation payouts from work-related illnesses. </p> <p>How we work is also a factor. Being draped over a keyboard with a phone clutched to your shoulder hardly works up a sweat, and it doesn't do much for your posture either. The first six years of the 1990s saw a 122% rise in occupational illnesses, which added up to 2% of the nation's GDP lost to work-related illnesses. </p> <p>But clearly the benefits of you getting fit are not just confined to your boss. \"We drive more, sit more and take too many lifts,\" says Dr Kirstie Gibson, assistant medical director of BUPA wellbeing and corporate health division. \"Activity helps your heart, your metabolism and reduces your cholesterol. Sitting around will mean that your flexibility will go as well as your stamina - you won't be able to run for that bus.\" </p> <p>Putting its money where its professional mouth is, BUPA offers its staff an onsite gym, which opens from 8am to 8.30pm. Nellie Raymond, 38, PA to the director of corporate communications, uses the gym three times a week. Along with the 330 other staff in the company's central London headquarters, she can also choose from nine aerobic classes held each week. \"I usually use the gym at the end of the day and I could be there anything from 45 minutes to an hour.\" </p> <p>But there was no dramatic new year resolution or road to Damascas conversion for Raymond. She cheerfully admits to having always been a \"gym person\" - she is even a fitness instructor in her spare time. So she has become one of the increasing number of employees who consider gym facilities a vital workplace benefit. \"Of course it is a motivating factor,\" she says. \"If I had the option of a contract with a company with a gym or one without, I know which one I would chose.\" </p> <p>What she really rates is the convenience. \"It would be a real struggle for me to get to a local gym. I wouldn't go so often and gradually I know the pounds would creep back on. This way I can regulate my body weight and stay healthier.\" </p> <p>Up to 200 members of Visa International's west London staff use the company's gym facilities every month to spin, step and tone their legs, tums and bums. Lunchtime is the busiest and among members of staff to be found pounding the flesh is 27-year-old Jane McInnes, PA to the vice-president of corporate communications. \"I work out three times a week with either yoga classes or stretching sessions,\" she says. \"It really suits me, helps me unwind and gets me away from my desk. I have had lapses when I haven't worked out quite so much, but my stamina level went down. I have now quite simply made this part of my lifestyle.\" </p> <p>But if you are the sort of person who is exhausted just reading this, and doesn't relish the thought of greeting your boss on the rowing machine at lunch dressed in something tiny in Lycra, there are alternatives that companies may offer. BA's new headquarters near Heathrow offers a gym and classes, but as Judy Cook, head of nursing services for BA, explains, there is plenty for those who don't like the gym. In BA's case, this includes football, ballroom dancing and golf. </p> <p>\"The whole point of occupational health is about self-care for people and to stop people getting ill,\" says Cook. \"Most large organisations don't as yet audit health, but we know from a gut reaction that occupational health has to be proactive.\" </p> <p>Even if your company does not provide formal exercise facilities, there is nothing to stop you mobilising your colleagues into getting active. Posting a notice on the internal mail system is a good way to identify other slothful types who feel they should be getting fit but can't face it alone. Why not arrange to meet at lunchtime for a short jog around the office? </p> <p>The rule of thumb as to how little you can do to stay healthy is 30 minutes' activity three to five times a week. You can walk to work instead of taking the car, use the stairs not the lift, walk an extra bus stop rather than getting on at the stop outside your house. </p> <p>\"Obesity leads to a greater risk of diabetes, and being overweight increases blood pressure,\" says Dr Gibson. \"Activity at any age is good news, but later on in life it's almost like a personal health insurance.\"</p>",

How we work is also a factor. Being draped over a keyboard with a phone clutched to your shoulder hardly works up a sweat, and it doesn't do much for your posture either. The first six years of the 1990s saw a 122% rise in occupational illnesses, which added up to 2% of the nation's GDP lost to work-related illnesses. But clearly the benefits of you getting fit are not just confined to your boss. \"We drive more, sit more and take too many lifts,\" says Dr Kirstie Gibson, assistant medical director of BUPA wellbeing and corporate health division. \"Activity helps your heart, your metabolism and reduces your cholesterol. Sitting around will mean that your flexibility will go as well as your stamina - you won't be able to run for that bus.\" Putting its money where its professional mouth is, BUPA offers its staff an onsite gym, which opens from 8am to 8.30pm. Nellie Raymond, 38, PA to the director of corporate communications, uses the gym three times a week. Along with the 330 other staff in the company's central London headquarters, she can also choose from nine aerobic classes held each week. \"I usually use the gym at the end of the day and I could be there anything from 45 minutes to an hour.\" But there was no dramatic new year resolution or road to Damascas conversion for Raymond. She cheerfully admits to having always been a \"gym person\" - she is even a fitness instructor in her spare time. So she has become one of the increasing number of employees who consider gym facilities a vital workplace benefit. \"Of course it is a motivating factor,\" she says. \"If I had the option of a contract with a company with a gym or one without, I know which one I would chose.\" What she really rates is the convenience. \"It would be a real struggle for me to get to a local gym. I wouldn't go so often and gradually I know the pounds would creep back on. This way I can regulate my body weight and stay healthier.\" Up to 200 members of Visa International's west London staff use the company's gym facilities every month to spin, step and tone their legs, tums and bums. Lunchtime is the busiest and among members of staff to be found pounding the flesh is 27-year-old Jane McInnes, PA to the vice-president of corporate communications. \"I work out three times a week with either yoga classes or stretching sessions,\" she says. \"It really suits me, helps me unwind and gets me away from my desk. I have had lapses when I haven't worked out quite so much, but my stamina level went down. I have now quite simply made this part of my lifestyle.\" But if you are the sort of person who is exhausted just reading this, and doesn't relish the thought of greeting your boss on the rowing machine at lunch dressed in something tiny in Lycra, there are alternatives that companies may offer. BA's new headquarters near Heathrow offers a gym and classes, but as Judy Cook, head of nursing services for BA, explains, there is plenty for those who don't like the gym. In BA's case, this includes football, ballroom dancing and golf. \"The whole point of occupational health is about self-care for people and to stop people getting ill,\" says Cook. \"Most large organisations don't as yet audit health, but we know from a gut reaction that occupational health has to be proactive.\" Even if your company does not provide formal exercise facilities, there is nothing to stop you mobilising your colleagues into getting active. Posting a notice on the internal mail system is a good way to identify other slothful types who feel they should be getting fit but can't face it alone. Why not arrange to meet at lunchtime for a short jog around the office? The rule of thumb as to how little you can do to stay healthy is 30 minutes' activity three to five times a week. You can walk to work instead of taking the car, use the stairs not the lift, walk an extra bus stop rather than getting on at the stop outside your house. \"Obesity leads to a greater risk of diabetes, and being overweight increases blood pressure,\" says Dr Gibson. \"Activity at any age is good news, but later on in life it's almost like a personal health insurance.\"",
