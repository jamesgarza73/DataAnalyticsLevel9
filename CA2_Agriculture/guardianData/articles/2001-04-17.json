On the first occasion he ran clear and squared for Tommy Mooney to score. On the second, he ignored Mooney's calls and scored himself from the edge of the area. On both occasions the Wolves defence played as if they couldn't have cared less. </p> <p>When Smith was released again in the 33rd minute, Sean Connelly decided to assert himself. He pulled the forward's shirt and with the game still awaiting its first booking, was sent off. The game appeared over. </p> <p>The referee however knew better and, as the half drew to a close, awarded a penalty for Paul Robinson's push on Michael Branch. With Alec Chamberlain static, George Ndah scored from the spot. </p> <p>Despite this encouragement Wolves made no attempt to add to the goal as the second half began. Instead they were pegged back for 15 minutes in which the home side could have scored two more. </p> <p>Allan Nielsen, hit the bar with a contortionist's interpretation of a bicycle kick before Noel-Williams drew a fine save from Michael Oakes with a header from Nielsen's centre. Wolves eventually emerged from their shells to gain some kind of foothold in the game, but were fortunate to score from the first real chance of the half. With ten minutes remaining, Ndah nodded down Branch's corner and Adam Proudlock, a second-half substitute, turned to score. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It was sure to be an evening which will linger in the memory of all those present, as well as one that carried old memories for the former Wolves manager, Graham Taylor. Watford still believe they can have a say in the play-off positions - the least of their aspirations given the talent at their disposal. There can be few more promising youngsters outside the top-flight than Tommy Smith, the young Watford forward who did much to decide this game in the first half. Twice within the first 15 minutes he was found in space by Gifton Noel-Williams. On the first occasion he ran clear and squared for Tommy Mooney to score. On the second, he ignored Mooney's calls and scored himself from the edge of the area. On both occasions the Wolves defence played as if they couldn't have cared less. When Smith was released again in the 33rd minute, Sean Connelly decided to assert himself. He pulled the forward's shirt and with the game still awaiting its first booking, was sent off. The game appeared over. The referee however knew better and, as the half drew to a close, awarded a penalty for Paul Robinson's push on Michael Branch. With Alec Chamberlain static, George Ndah scored from the spot. Despite this encouragement Wolves made no attempt to add to the goal as the second half began. Instead they were pegged back for 15 minutes in which the home side could have scored two more. Allan Nielsen, hit the bar with a contortionist's interpretation of a bicycle kick before Noel-Williams drew a fine save from Michael Oakes with a header from Nielsen's centre. Wolves eventually emerged from their shells to gain some kind of foothold in the game, but were fortunate to score from the first real chance of the half. With ten minutes remaining, Ndah nodded down Branch's corner and Adam Proudlock, a second-half substitute, turned to score. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

This is partly for good reasons, (stakeholder pensions), and partly for less good reasons stemming from pensions misselling and recent problems at the Equitable. But there is a more important, more fundamental and worrying reason for pensions to be in the news. This is the impact of current deflationary pressures, which are driving down investment returns. The problems at the Equitable were a direct result of this trend. </p> <p>For the past 50 years all participants in economic life have become accustomed to inflation. They are well used to beating inflation by leveraging property investment, buying equities and participating in the restructuring of the old economy with management buy-outs and management buy-ins in the venture capital industry. This process was stimulated by the tendency of governments and central banks to keep interest rates too low during the inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. The reverse risk is now occurring and it will not be long before the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will have to write to the chancellor to explain why they have undershot the inflation target, which is another way of saying that they are driving deflation. </p> <p>The good news of stakeholder pensions (and the great encouragement to the public to focus on saving for retirement) must be tempered by two important factors. First, the creation of stakeholder pensions (with very modest initial commitments) is just the first step of a massive risk-transfer from the government to the public. The politicians have realised that they will not be able to afford the cost of old-age pensions and the health service and other forms of social security. So one of them has to go, and health and social security are still sacred cows in terms of risk-transfer to the public. It is by no means facile to believe that in 25 years' time state pensions will largely have been eliminated. Thus the allowable contribution to stakeholder pensions will rise steadily in order to facilitate this process. </p> <p>This explains why some far-sighted fund managers have offered to run stakeholder pensions free to start with, as they correctly foresee massive increases of funds under management in this area in the future. The bad news (as personal pension holders are discovering) is that as interest rates fall and investment yields decline, so do the value of annuities. At present this is also coupled with being forced to buy an annuity at the age of 75. </p> <p>The decline in investment yields will drive up the savings rate as people wake up to the new situation and realise how underfunded their pensions are. Ask anyone aged 50 or older - they have seen annuity yields fall by between 30% and 40% (people fail to realise that this is what a decline from, say, 9% to 6% really means). Although inflation may be falling, it is not producing parallel price declines. All of this will reinforce the disinflationary pressure. </p> <p>Another factor that inflation has bred into the system is the concept of \"total returns\", adding the capital appreciation to the dividend on equities, for instance. Again the former element has been fuelled by inflation and the enormous appreciation of equity prices in recent years, which in turn has been driven by the restructuring of the old economy and the impact of technology. </p> <p>The necessary adjustment to this post-inflationary environment is only just starting and will need to be fuelled by further cuts in interest rates. Unless this happens quickly so that everyone's mindset is thereby adjusted, the threat to pensions both in terms of their value and the speed with which government can transfer the risk to the private sector will increase. It is good news from the UK's point of view that we have made a major start in the risk-transfer through personal pensions and now stakeholder pensions. Europe is very far behind in recognising this problem. </p> <p>The second ticking time bomb in the pensions field concerns companies (and this includes most of the largest old economy companies) which still offer final salary-linked pensions, usually with upwards-only RPI indexing. If inflation goes to zero or even negative, these companies will be faced with annually increasing pension commitments, which could prove crippling. This is exacerbated by the fact that these companies have been shrinking their payrolls by pensioning off 50 year olds, and will have to support this pension bill with fewer active members. No wonder more and more companies are closing such schemes to new joiners. </p> <p>\u0095 David Potter is former chairman of City bankers Guinness Mahon. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" david@pdjh.demon.co.uk\">david@pdjh.demon.co.uk</a></p>",

This explains why some far-sighted fund managers have offered to run stakeholder pensions free to start with, as they correctly foresee massive increases of funds under management in this area in the future. The bad news (as personal pension holders are discovering) is that as interest rates fall and investment yields decline, so do the value of annuities. At present this is also coupled with being forced to buy an annuity at the age of 75. The decline in investment yields will drive up the savings rate as people wake up to the new situation and realise how underfunded their pensions are. Ask anyone aged 50 or older - they have seen annuity yields fall by between 30% and 40% (people fail to realise that this is what a decline from, say, 9% to 6% really means). Although inflation may be falling, it is not producing parallel price declines. All of this will reinforce the disinflationary pressure. Another factor that inflation has bred into the system is the concept of \"total returns\", adding the capital appreciation to the dividend on equities, for instance. Again the former element has been fuelled by inflation and the enormous appreciation of equity prices in recent years, which in turn has been driven by the restructuring of the old economy and the impact of technology. The necessary adjustment to this post-inflationary environment is only just starting and will need to be fuelled by further cuts in interest rates. Unless this happens quickly so that everyone's mindset is thereby adjusted, the threat to pensions both in terms of their value and the speed with which government can transfer the risk to the private sector will increase. It is good news from the UK's point of view that we have made a major start in the risk-transfer through personal pensions and now stakeholder pensions. Europe is very far behind in recognising this problem. The second ticking time bomb in the pensions field concerns companies (and this includes most of the largest old economy companies) which still offer final salary-linked pensions, usually with upwards-only RPI indexing. If inflation goes to zero or even negative, these companies will be faced with annually increasing pension commitments, which could prove crippling. This is exacerbated by the fact that these companies have been shrinking their payrolls by pensioning off 50 year olds, and will have to support this pension bill with fewer active members. No wonder more and more companies are closing such schemes to new joiners. \u0095 David Potter is former chairman of City bankers Guinness Mahon. david@pdjh.demon.co.uk",

The young defender's goal followed fine work by Eranio, who added his name to the score sheet when he ended a mazy run by sliding the ball past Simon Royce. The hosts were rarely troubled apart from two headers from corners shortly after half-time. Gary Rowett's was cleared off the line by Chris Riggott and Mart Poom tipped Arnar Gunnlaugsson's to safety via the crossbar. But City's revival was short-lived, making another dismal day for their manager Peter Taylor. The defeat means his team have lost 10 on the bounce away from home and six in succession anywhere - a run that has probably wrecked their hopes of qualifying for Europe. \"If we win our last four games that will take us to 57 points and we could be lucky and qualify,\" Taylor said. \"We didn't deserve to take any points today because of our first-half display and, if I'm honest, we don't deserve to qualify for Europe because of the way we're playing.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He plays in Ljungberg on the right but his cross comes to nothing. 57 Henry races into the area, but is deflected away from goal by the attentions of Pellegrino, and the Arsenal striker can only find the side-netting. 59 Veiera coming into his own in midfield, starting things off for Arsenal and making crucial tackles. 60 Valencia manager Cuper starting to look agitated on the touchline - expect changes soon. 62 Pellegrino chops down Wiltord 35 yards out for a free-kick - wasted at a point in the game when Arsenal look the dominent side. 63 In the next minute Keown gets in a crucial header in the six-yard box to deny the goal that Valencia require. Sign of urgency from the home side as they step up the pace. 66 Heart-stopping moment for Arsenal when Mendieta goes down in the Arsenal area under pressure from Keown. Keown had his foot out but Menieta took a dive. Howls from the crowd. 67 Substitution \u00a314m Argentinian Aimar on for Angulo. 68 Arsenal free-kick to the right of the Valencia area - straight at Canizares. Henry follows up with sublime skill in the area to tee up an ultimately aimless shot across the face of goal. In his defence, it was a hopeless angle. 71 Arsenal free-kick on the right-hand edge of the Valencia area after Henry jigs around and his dragged down by Djukic for his trouble. Pires takes; results in a corner that comes to nothing. 72 Substitution Zahovic on for Sanchez. 75 GOAL: Valencia 1 - 0 Arsenal Angloma crosses for Carew to climb above Adams and send the stadium into raptures with the goal that could well settle this tie. 77 Substitution Kanu on for Pires. 83 Arsenal pushing up at every opportunity while Valencia, with the crowd now well and truly behind them, knock the ball around as if they have been in this position all night. 85 Arsenal win a corner, comes to nothing. 89 The last few minutes have been hell for Arsenal as they fail to create any late chances and Valencia continue to pile on the pressure. 90 Three minutes of stoppage time to play. Vieira crosses to Henry at the far post, Canizares punches clear for a throw. Valencia clear and break, Vicente goes one on one with Seaman and the Arsenal keeper gets there first. Arsenal pile up for one last chance - Henry shoots from 20 yards but it is easy for Canzares. Full-time All over for Arsenal as Wenger stands disbelieving on the touchline. They controlled much of the game, but probably started to enjoy themselves too much and paid the price. Valencia it is who go through to face Leeds in the first semi-final after the Yorkshire club went through 3-2 on aggregate against Deportivo.",

The championship may have slipped away but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reminded his players last night that this season could end with unprecedented success.</p> <p>An FA Cup final against Liverpool is booked for May 12 and a first European Cup final appearance will be two games off if Arsenal hold the 2-1 lead they bring here. Dragging the team off the beach is the least of Wenger's worries.</p> <p>\"You don't need to motivate players for a game like this,\" said the Frenchman, who knows Leeds or Deportivo La Coruna await the winners. \"You need to give belief to the players that they can do it. If you are not motivated at this level you should change your job.\"</p> <p>Arsenal, aware they will go out on away goals if they lose 1-0, will play their usual positive game against a side unbeaten in 16 Champions League matches in the Mestalla stadium. \"If we spend 90 minutes in our box we have no chance,\" Wenger admitted.</p> <p>He will draw hope from the knowledge that Valencia have lost their previous two league games here and four of their last five matches. Yet the manager realises much will depend on his experienced defenders.</p> <p>Since October's 1-1 draw at Lazio Arsenal have tended to lose away to quality opposition - heavily at Liverpool, Manchester United and Spartak Moscow, beaten at Leeds too and the comprehensive 1-0 defeat at Bayern Munich last month. A display more in line with February's 1-0 win at Lyon is required.</p> <p>\"I need the top defenders at the top level,\" said Wenger who, with Silvinho injured, will play Ashley Cole at left-back. \"We know that in such a game we will need a big save from David Seaman and a big tackle from [Martin] Keown and [Tony] Adams. We know that without that we haven't got a chance.\"</p> <p>Valencia, last season's beaten finalists, give a late test to the left midfielder Vicente. \"I don't want the team to commit suicide in the first 20 minutes,\" said their coach Hector Cuper. \"We will play with our hearts but we must also use our heads.\"</p> <p><strong>Valencia (4-3-1-2, possible):</strong> Canizares; Angloma, Ayala, Pellegrino, Carboni; Mendieta, Baraja, Vicente/Angulo; Aimar; Carew, Sanchez.</p> <p><strong>Arsenal (4-4-2, possible):</strong> Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Adams, Cole; Pires, Parlour, Vieira, Ljungberg; Kanu, Henry.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Anyone expecting to find Arsenal in a state of depression after Saturday's 3-0 home defeat by Middlesbrough is in for a shock. The championship may have slipped away but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reminded his players last night that this season could end with unprecedented success. An FA Cup final against Liverpool is booked for May 12 and a first European Cup final appearance will be two games off if Arsenal hold the 2-1 lead they bring here. Dragging the team off the beach is the least of Wenger's worries. \"You don't need to motivate players for a game like this,\" said the Frenchman, who knows Leeds or Deportivo La Coruna await the winners. \"You need to give belief to the players that they can do it. If you are not motivated at this level you should change your job.\" Arsenal, aware they will go out on away goals if they lose 1-0, will play their usual positive game against a side unbeaten in 16 Champions League matches in the Mestalla stadium. \"If we spend 90 minutes in our box we have no chance,\" Wenger admitted. He will draw hope from the knowledge that Valencia have lost their previous two league games here and four of their last five matches. Yet the manager realises much will depend on his experienced defenders. Since October's 1-1 draw at Lazio Arsenal have tended to lose away to quality opposition - heavily at Liverpool, Manchester United and Spartak Moscow, beaten at Leeds too and the comprehensive 1-0 defeat at Bayern Munich last month. A display more in line with February's 1-0 win at Lyon is required. \"I need the top defenders at the top level,\" said Wenger who, with Silvinho injured, will play Ashley Cole at left-back. \"We know that in such a game we will need a big save from David Seaman and a big tackle from [Martin] Keown and [Tony] Adams. We know that without that we haven't got a chance.\" Valencia, last season's beaten finalists, give a late test to the left midfielder Vicente. \"I don't want the team to commit suicide in the first 20 minutes,\" said their coach Hector Cuper. \"We will play with our hearts but we must also use our heads.\" Valencia (4-3-1-2, possible): Canizares; Angloma, Ayala, Pellegrino, Carboni; Mendieta, Baraja, Vicente/Angulo; Aimar; Carew, Sanchez. Arsenal (4-4-2, possible): Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Adams, Cole; Pires, Parlour, Vieira, Ljungberg; Kanu, Henry. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Behind his studied blank-generation exterior, and ever-present camouflage of leather jacket, ripped jeans and giant sunglasses, Joey Ramone, who has died aged 49 after a six-year struggle against lymphatic cancer, brought an acid wit and a critical brain to punk rock.</p> <p>Joey played his first gig with the Ramones in 1974, and later that year the group was booked for a residency at New York's influential club, CBGB's. With his cohorts Dee Dee, Johnny and Tommy Ramone - their adopted surname was a musical alias once used by Paul McCartney - Joey created a blueprint of short, furious songs played at terrifying speed which would prove hugely influential on Britain's punk-rock movement. The Ramones will always be remembered for such deadpan classics as Beat on the Brat, I Wanna Be Sedated and Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue.</p> <p>Joey was born Jeffrey Hyman in the Forest Hills district of New York. Although the Ramones cultivated a sullen, gum-chewing, delinquent image, the embodiment of their song Teenage Lobotomy, the young Jeff displayed sensitivity and artistic leanings. His mother ran an art gallery, and her son dabbled with painting before transferring his allegiance to music. He studied jazz drumming for a time and, during the early 1970s, played in several bands in the New York area, sometimes as \"Jeff Starship\".</p> <p>When the Ramones formed, the original plan was for Joey to be the drummer, but as the songs became increasingly frantic, he could not keep up, and switched to singing instead. He developed a monotonous nasal drone and impassive stage demeanour which became key ingredients of the band's cartoon-like appeal. According to Danny Fields, who became their manager and netted them a 1975 Sire Records contract, \"He was a perfect instrument of those songs and that speed and that energy. He never screamed, never waved his arms around. He stood in one place and delivered. It was so tasteful.\"</p> <p>\"Taste\", though, was not high on the band's agenda. Their first single, Blitzkrieg Bop, was released in 1976, the title perfectly capturing a sense of their mission to put bloated 70s rock to the torch. Music then, Joey pointed out, was \"a hotchpotch of Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and all that. So basically we stripped it right down to the bone, and we disassembled it and reassembled it and put all the raw energy and raw emotion and guts and attitude back into it.\"</p> <p>Their debut album, The Ramones, sent shockwaves through a moribund music scene. While the combo's New York contemporaries were the far more pretentious likes of Talking Heads, Patti Smith and Television, British punks seized on the band's minimalist message with zeal. In November 1976, the Ramones were scheduled to tour Britain with the Sex Pistols, a potentially cataclysmic event scuppered when the New Yorkers pulled out. Only recently, former Clash frontman Joe Strummer described the Ramones as \"the daddy punk group of all time\". The band undertook its first British tour in 1977, in the wake of the Leave Home album. The group's \"gabba-gabba-hey!\" catchphrase became the toast of the music press, and Sheena Is a Punk Rocker was a British top 30 hit.</p> <p>As the initial frenzy of punk subsided, the Ramones' affection for classic rock'n'roll became more apparent. In 1979, ghoulmeister Roger Corman hired them to appear in his film Rock'n'Roll High School, in which they performed the title track. This brought them into contact with Phil Spector, who produced the soundtrack, and Spector subsequently produced the next Ramones album, 1980's End of the Century. Though the group would later denounce it as their worst album, it did give them a top 10 British hit with a cover of the Ronettes' Baby I Love You, Spector's 1964 classic. The album reached number 44 on the US charts, their best ever effort in their own country.</p> <p>Joey became close friends with Ronnie Spector, Spector's ex-wife, whose singing with the Ronettes was cited by the lanky Ramone as one of his greatest inspirations. When Ronnie made a comeback in the late 1990s, Joey produced an album and EP for her, and often joined her on stage. The Ramones' own career, meanwhile, had become steady rather than spectacular. They released 21 albums during 22 years together and, while never enjoying lavish commercial success, they could always depend on a loyal fan base and on the continuing goodwill of generations of bands who were happy to acknowledge their influence.</p> <p>Bruce Springsteen wrote Hungry Heart for the Ramones after seeing them perform in New Jersey, but his manager Jon Landau persuaded him to save it for his own album, The River. During the 1980s, Joey was among the performers featured on the Artists United Against Apartheid anthem, Sun City. It was also Joey who masterminded the band's 1985 song Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, a furious tirade about Ronald Reagan's visit to a German military cemetery.</p> <p>After a final album, Adios Amigos, the Ramones disbanded in 1996. Joey worked intermittently on a solo album which remains unreleased, in between hosting shows at Manhattan clubs and sometimes performing with his brother, Mickey Leigh.</p> <p>He is survived by his mother and brother.</p> <p>\u0095 Joey Ramone (Jeffrey Hyman), musician, born May 19 1951; died April 4 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "Behind his studied blank-generation exterior, and ever-present camouflage of leather jacket, ripped jeans and giant sunglasses, Joey Ramone, who has died aged 49 after a six-year struggle against lymphatic cancer, brought an acid wit and a critical brain to punk rock. Joey played his first gig with the Ramones in 1974, and later that year the group was booked for a residency at New York's influential club, CBGB's. With his cohorts Dee Dee, Johnny and Tommy Ramone - their adopted surname was a musical alias once used by Paul McCartney - Joey created a blueprint of short, furious songs played at terrifying speed which would prove hugely influential on Britain's punk-rock movement. The Ramones will always be remembered for such deadpan classics as Beat on the Brat, I Wanna Be Sedated and Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue. Joey was born Jeffrey Hyman in the Forest Hills district of New York. Although the Ramones cultivated a sullen, gum-chewing, delinquent image, the embodiment of their song Teenage Lobotomy, the young Jeff displayed sensitivity and artistic leanings. His mother ran an art gallery, and her son dabbled with painting before transferring his allegiance to music. He studied jazz drumming for a time and, during the early 1970s, played in several bands in the New York area, sometimes as \"Jeff Starship\". When the Ramones formed, the original plan was for Joey to be the drummer, but as the songs became increasingly frantic, he could not keep up, and switched to singing instead. He developed a monotonous nasal drone and impassive stage demeanour which became key ingredients of the band's cartoon-like appeal. According to Danny Fields, who became their manager and netted them a 1975 Sire Records contract, \"He was a perfect instrument of those songs and that speed and that energy. He never screamed, never waved his arms around. He stood in one place and delivered. It was so tasteful.\" \"Taste\", though, was not high on the band's agenda. Their first single, Blitzkrieg Bop, was released in 1976, the title perfectly capturing a sense of their mission to put bloated 70s rock to the torch. Music then, Joey pointed out, was \"a hotchpotch of Pink Floyd and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and all that. So basically we stripped it right down to the bone, and we disassembled it and reassembled it and put all the raw energy and raw emotion and guts and attitude back into it.\" Their debut album, The Ramones, sent shockwaves through a moribund music scene. While the combo's New York contemporaries were the far more pretentious likes of Talking Heads, Patti Smith and Television, British punks seized on the band's minimalist message with zeal. In November 1976, the Ramones were scheduled to tour Britain with the Sex Pistols, a potentially cataclysmic event scuppered when the New Yorkers pulled out. Only recently, former Clash frontman Joe Strummer described the Ramones as \"the daddy punk group of all time\". The band undertook its first British tour in 1977, in the wake of the Leave Home album. The group's \"gabba-gabba-hey!\" catchphrase became the toast of the music press, and Sheena Is a Punk Rocker was a British top 30 hit. As the initial frenzy of punk subsided, the Ramones' affection for classic rock'n'roll became more apparent. In 1979, ghoulmeister Roger Corman hired them to appear in his film Rock'n'Roll High School, in which they performed the title track. This brought them into contact with Phil Spector, who produced the soundtrack, and Spector subsequently produced the next Ramones album, 1980's End of the Century. Though the group would later denounce it as their worst album, it did give them a top 10 British hit with a cover of the Ronettes' Baby I Love You, Spector's 1964 classic. The album reached number 44 on the US charts, their best ever effort in their own country. Joey became close friends with Ronnie Spector, Spector's ex-wife, whose singing with the Ronettes was cited by the lanky Ramone as one of his greatest inspirations. When Ronnie made a comeback in the late 1990s, Joey produced an album and EP for her, and often joined her on stage. The Ramones' own career, meanwhile, had become steady rather than spectacular. They released 21 albums during 22 years together and, while never enjoying lavish commercial success, they could always depend on a loyal fan base and on the continuing goodwill of generations of bands who were happy to acknowledge their influence. Bruce Springsteen wrote Hungry Heart for the Ramones after seeing them perform in New Jersey, but his manager Jon Landau persuaded him to save it for his own album, The River. During the 1980s, Joey was among the performers featured on the Artists United Against Apartheid anthem, Sun City. It was also Joey who masterminded the band's 1985 song Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, a furious tirade about Ronald Reagan's visit to a German military cemetery. After a final album, Adios Amigos, the Ramones disbanded in 1996. Joey worked intermittently on a solo album which remains unreleased, in between hosting shows at Manhattan clubs and sometimes performing with his brother, Mickey Leigh. He is survived by his mother and brother. \u0095 Joey Ramone (Jeffrey Hyman), musician, born May 19 1951; died April 4 2001",

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Try <a href=\"http://www.art-science.com/Ken/Alpine\">www.art-science.com/Ken/Alpine</a>, an the index of a number of trips in the Alpine region, with route-marked photos &amp; a correspondence page.</p> <p>Ken Baldry</p> <p> \u0095 Although all the European mountains have interesting wild flowers, for accessibility, number of species and spectacular scenery, the Dolomites are my first choice. Try Dobbiaco (or Toblach as it is also known) in the German-speaking region as a base. There are low-level walks near the town in meadows and woods, but to see the biggest range, take a car to the passes and refuges. You can drive up to the Tre Cima at around 2100m or the Auronzo Rifugio (2298m) where there are excellent paths that aren't too strenuous. You'll see many of the Dolomite specialities like the Devil's Claw and poppies within easy reach. The scenery at the Tre Cima is magical. Further south, I wouldn't miss the Pordoi pass. If you want a more southerly base try Cortina. The last week of June is probably the earliest to go but I prefer the first two weeks in July to see the best range of flowers.<br> Alan Davison </p> <p> \u0095 I would strongly recommend the Cevennes as a walking area. The scenery is splendid and there is a good network of well signed Grandes Randonees giving a choice of easy or strenuous out and back or circular routes accessible from roadside parking. With three companions in our 50s and 60s, I had an excellent holiday there in 1994, staying in a converted hilltop fortress - the Castella - near St Bonnet, booked through Vacances in Campagne - and the weather was superb!<br> Michael Miller</p> <p>\u0095 Last year, my husband and I stayed in a lovely chalet in a small village called Manigod, which is about 20 minutes drive from Annecy in the Haute Savoie in France. There were superb walks and trails around the mountains and through the forests and valleys, all within easy access by foot or vehicle from the chalet, and with varying standards of difficulty. You should possibly allow longer than the local guidebooks recommend for these walks to allow time to enjoy the view, sniff the flowers (and take a few breathers!)</p> <p>We booked through Brittany Ferries, who have several g\u00eetes in the area.</p> <p>Good luck! <br>Carolyn Scallan</p> <p>\u0095 We went to the village of Auffach in Wildsch\u00f6nau, Austria, in June 1999. The flowers and the meadows were beautiful. There are at least two gondolas in the valley which allow you to gain altitude easily, and help towards the wilder places. There were some fairly long days' walking, but a pleasant Pension in the village to return to each evening. We went with Waymark, and were very happy with all the arrangements.<br>Colin and Cyndy Patey</p> <p>\u0095 Last year we visited Slovenia and walked in the Julian Alps and Karavanke range close to the magical resort of Lake Bled. The warm climate produces a higher tree line than in other parts of the Alps, with deciduous trees predominating over evergreens. The abundance of wild flowers on the walks led to slow progress as the flora enthusiasts paused to identify them. We walked with a friendly local company, Koren Sports, whose programme is available through Freedom of Slovenia (<a href=\"http://www.humanfish.com\">www.humanfish.com</a>) and Slovenija Pursuits (0870 2 200 201). They offer adventure sports, trekking and a number of day walks, including transport to reduce the amount of climbing.<br>John Cresswell and Sharon Smith</p> <p> \u0095 June is rather early for walking in the Alps as some paths are likely still to be blocked by snow, but it is lovely for flowers. Four years ago we flew into Zurich and took the train to Pontresina, thinking that the weather and snow conditions would be best in the south. The railway journey on the Rhaetische Bahn is an experience in itself, and Pontresina is an excellent centre as it is at the hub of several radiating valleys. One can walk straight out along the Val Rosegg, getting wonderful views of the high peaks, or take the bus or train for a few miles along another valley and walk back. For a different level, there is the Muottas Muragl funicular, and here we followed the retreating snow for soldanella and other delights. If the weather is bad one can take the fantastically engineered railway over the pass into Italy for the day.</p> <p>After a few days, we went north to the Swiss National Park, where marmots and deer are virtually guaranteed, and lammergeier have been reintroduced, though we didn't see any. Here we had more good walking, straight out of the hotel and using the bus. Working our way back in the general direction of Zurich, we spent a few days at Wengen, and although the famous views were mostly hidden in the clouds, the lower level walking was not affected, and the flower meadows were wonderful. If the weather turns really bad, as it did for us, it is a good idea to try the Valais, where there is often a strip of sunshine along the Rhone, and have a couple of nights at Sion to see the castles. Alternatively, there is usually good weather, and good walking, in the Ticino, which can be reached by other interesting railways.</p> <p>This is in-between-season for the Alps, and some hotels and guesthouses are closed, but those that are open are very welcoming, and half-board (three nights minimum) at the cheaper Swiss hotels is invariably a good buy. It is never necessary to book in advance. Il Fuorn in the National Park was more expensive than the hotels where we normally stay, but not to be missed as it is in the middle of wonderful country. When we arrived at Wengen, as usual we looked for the cheapest hotel, and it turned out to be their rest day. The door was open, and a number to ring left by the telephone. So we rang, and a voice told us to take a room key and make ourselves at home! At Sion, it was rest day when we left, so we were given the hotel key and asked to lock up before we departed! We have many other happy memories of Swiss hotels and hoteliers, while for walking, Switzerland is our favourite country. Despite its reputation, it is not unduly expensive.<br>Rosemary and Derek Moore</p> <p>\u0095 My wife and I (now aged 64 &amp; 69) have been walking and climbing in the various mountains of Europe for about 25 years and it is our considered opinion that if somewhere is a 'beautiful wild area' as sought after by Peter Adams and is also accessible without some hard work on foot, then it is immediately filled up with people and hotels, destroying the thing that made the place attractive in the first place. However, let's have a try.</p> <p>The Ordesa (not Odessa) National Park in the Pyrenees is as good a place as you can get and is really fairly easy walking but if that is too tough then one could try the other end of the same range. There is a small French village called Py approachable from Villefranche de Confluent on the N116 west of Perpignan and the surrounding area has narrow valleys which are a paradise for butterflies. There is also 'Le Canigou', the highest point in Catalonia. Above Py is the tiny hamlet of Mantet, also a possibility. These places do not at present have much accommodation but are feasible as days out by car and on foot from the main road.</p> <p>Another possibility might be the Massif Central which resembles the English Lake District without lakes; it may be crowded in the French holiday periods. Better, in June, might be the Queyras, the mountain group south-east of Briancon. This is a large district and has some considerable mountains on the border between France and Italy but accessible by car there are many delightful valleys with fairly uncrowded excursions. Drive up the D902 out of Guillestre (off the N94 south of Briancon), the route splits here and you can go up the Combe du Queyras to Chateau-Queyras and other villages (try St Veran) or towards the Val d'Escreins Nature Reserve (hotels unlikely) or St Marcellin and Les Claux.</p> <p>West of Briancon are the Dauphine Alps (National Parc Les Ecrins). These are wonderful for wildlife but may be too rugged if one finds Ordesa a bit hard.</p> <p>There is, however, the Vosges, between Nancy and Mulhouse; rather a lot of coniferous forests but easy walking and good hotels with gargantuan repasts. Or the Vanoise National Park around Pralognan, which has NO ski lifts.</p> <p>Further afield there are the Italian Dolomites. The valleys around Alleghe or Caprile have walks in mixed forest (but try the Val d'Ombretta) but also small hills with breathtaking views of the bigger mountains. An alternative might be the (German-speaking although Italian) Pustertal - Val Pusteria at the extreme north of the region; several nice teutonic towns e.g. Innichen (Sn Candido), Sexten, Toblach (Dobbiaco) and so on and there are easy walks to the Austrian frontier which are almost deserted.</p> <p>But if you want peace and quiet you must be prepared to work for it; the unspoilt, undiscovered, easy mountain country of the Victorians has been discovered and, I regret, spoilt.<br>Alan Travis Braddock</p> <p>\u0095 We recommend the Vercours, a region of limestone hills, forest and pasture featured in the Guardian in June 1990. We travelled by TGV to Grenoble (we could have flown or driven our car). We were armed with a 50,000 map \"Itineraires de Randonnees\" sheet 12 and the \"Topo-Guide\" for France's long distance footpaths GR 9, 91,93, 95, in French. We took the rather sparse bus service westwards out of town and walked south on the GR91 to small villages and towns each having a modest but comfortable hotel. This form of lodging minimised the weight of our rucksacks. Daily distances were not excessive, usually less than 1000m vertical and 20Km horizontal. I particularly recall the delightful ambience of the Hotel Val Fleuri in Lans-en-Vercours and the spectacular location of the Hotel du col de la Machine. On two occasions we hired bicycles by way of a change. Returning along GR9 we visited the impressive Grottes de Choranche.<br> John and Sylvia Faichney</p> <p>\u0095 How about the Alta Pusteria Valley in the Italian Dolomites? We've been going for 10 years. Very accessible by road and rail from airports such as Verona.Excellent local bus services and excursions if you want a 'day off'. Very helpful local tourist offices. Super hotels, guest houses and apartments in all categories. Wonderful local cuisine and wines, no high rise or modern buildings. We recommend Sesto or Dobbiaco which are well served by cable cars if you wish to do some high walking, but there are excellent waymarked paths on the flat through meadows filled with wild flowers plus river walks. Mainly a winter ski valley, but it excels in summer from mid-May and most hotels do 'Green week' packages which are great value.<br> Janice Carrera</p> <p>\u0095 Austria is just the right place for you. The Alps in the Eastern part of Austria (2000 metres) are a well-kept secret. You will find lush vegetation and spectacular views, but also cable cars and chairlifts which allow you to choose how much or little you want to walk. I recommend Puchberg/Schneeberg or Prein/Rax as a base. And if you are fed up with walking, Vienna is just an hour's drive away.<br>Fatima Martin</p> <p>\u0095 We have had many wonderful early summer walks in south-eastern Switzerland. The villages and small towns at 1000 - 1500m above sea level are ideal at that time, and most have hotels or inns, and excellent post bus connections to the main station in Chur. Arosa, Lenzerheide and Savonign are all pleasant towns with many walks; but for somewhere really quiet, one of our favourites is a small village called Tschiertschen. It sits on the side of a valley and is surrounded by meadows and woods, with the open high alp above. The seasons vary, but if you are lucky, in early June you can walk in a couple of hours from meadows in full flower up to crocuses just breaking through the snow. Wild life includes deer, chamois and steinbock. Not a suitable place, however, if you want level walking - or exciting night life.<br> J Post</p> <p>\u0095 I suggest Crans-Montana near Sierre in the Rhone valley, Switzerland. There are all sorts of walks starting from there, at all grades of difficulty. The easiest are very pleasant strolls and the longer ones can take you to 10000 feet. The walks are well marked and mapped. There is no shortage of alpine meadows with abundant flora - and the\"reines de Vallais\", as the local cows are known, are on the mountain pastures, bells clanging furiously. Placid creatures they are not, but fortunately they take it out on each other. Alpine choughs were all round us on one walk. The surrounding scenery in every direction is magnificent-snowy peaks in all directions. Not only that, but a bus service (free) will take you from the town to Vermala, which is a main starting and finishing point for the walks.

If the answer is 'very', try some of the higher Austrian resorts like Obergurgl. You can start walks above the tree line and be in grand scenery. \"Wild\" is a matter of definition as most day walks in that area will be on well-marked paths and you will meet other people. The Polish Tatras can offer you day walks that will take you over excellent high ridges, with only a minibus ride to get you to and from the start of walks. Try a shop with a really good selection of guides, like Jarvis Books in Matlock, for ideas.<br>David Hart</p> <p>\u0095 For stunning scenery and mountain walking (as opposed to mountaineering) in my opinion the Bernese Oberland area of Switzerland takes first prize every time. Alpine meadows nestling under the snow-covered mountains of the majestic Jungfrau and Eiger, what more do you need? 'Transport,' I hear you say. Well, the Swiss have already thought of that and their railway system is superb. The mountain railway takes you as far as possible, and signed footpaths tell you where you are going and approximately how long it will take you to get there. The mountain railway will take you back to your base when you decide you need a sit down with a cooling beer. If you find you need a day off from walking, you can take a cruise on a selection of lakes, or if you need to do any serious shopping, you can nip into Interlaken. Wengen, Grindelwald and Lauterbrunnen are good bases for a superb holiday. Ask your travel agent for details of the Swiss Travel Service.</p> <p>Barb Garner</p> <p>\u0095 Firstly the Auvergne region of France. If one bases the holiday on accommodation somewhere like Condat en Feniers or Besse en Chandesse there are numerous superb walks for most abilities in both the Monts du Cantal and the Monts Dore. In June the wild flowers are prolific and many raptors can be observed. The French IGN 1:25,000 map series show footpaths clearly and these are usually well marked on the ground too.</p> <p>Secondly the Bernese Oberland in Switzerland. We stayed in the Lenk district of the Simmental and purchased a fortnightly pass for use on cable cars going in two different directions. This enabled us to travel up from the valley floor to about 1,500 metres and arrive directly in the Alpine meadows to spend the days amongst the wild flowers. It was quite possible and not too difficult to walk over the mountain passes from the Simmental to places like Gstaad and Adelboden in neighbouring valleys and return on the same day via the efficient Swiss railways. Lenk comes just on the join of four maps but the local tourist office sells a special with the town appearing in the centre, which is much more useful for walkers.<br> Carol Berwick</p> <p>\u0095 Try Italy. The Sibillini National Park is easily reached from Rome, and has fantastic walking hills and valleys much like the Lake District. Also northern Tuscany, north of Barga has plenty of walking, a bit more rocky than the Sibillini, but still easily accessible (from Pisa or Bologna airports) and with hundreds of waymarked paths in flower meadows. <br>Stephen</p> <p>\u0095 We also are too old for backpacking and camping, but go with <a href=\"http://www.atg-oxford.co.uk\">ATG</a> who take luggage to the next stopping point and bring lunchtime picnics. This year we will try the JURA Covantannez gorge to Besancon. Flowers, mushrooms, forest, fertile valleys, castles, mountain villages. Trips in May and June, or September and October. May look expensive but covers all food and drink, everything you need except stamps and postcards.<br>Eileen Shirley</p> <p>\u0095 Barcelonnette in France. Go north into the Queyras if the weather is good, south into the Alpes Maritimes and Haute Provence (guaranteed sunshine) if it isn't. The very high roads and passes in these areas give access to wonderful, empty and wild mountains without being scared, exhausted or continually rained on (quite possibly all three) that is an ever present risk associated with the higher Alps. In June it will be perfect. See you there!<br> Simon Reece</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Adams should try the Austrian Tyrol where the mountain slopes are not rock and scree but beautiful pastures with abundant wild flowers. We've stayed several times in Saalbach Hinterglemm where there are plenty of well-marked circular walks suitable for varying levels of fitness - an English route guide is available in the resort. Once there, it's a good idea to buy an Alpin Pass which allows you to ride free on the local Postbus and gives you unlimited travel on the four gondolas that operate in the summer. On most of the mountains there are farmer's 'huttes' where you stop for lunch - do try both Tiroler Grostl and Kaiserscharrn but order one-between-two because portions are usually huge! We've been last week of June/first week July and there has still been snow on the mountain ridges so I wouldn't recommend going any earlier. Many mainstream tour operators offer Saalback Hinterglemm in their Lakes and Mountains programme - our favourite hotel is the family run Hotel Gungau in Hinterglemm. The website for the area is <a href=\"http://www.saalbach.com\">www.saalbach.com</a><br> Michele Covington-Jones</p> <p>\u0095 An ideal place for you would be the Berchtesgadener Land in Bavaria. I am from that area originally and every summer we go back for some gentle mountain walking. Our favourite is the Reiter Alm, a small mountain range with a mountain hut (run by the German Alpine Club). It's about two-three hours to the hut (depending which side of the mountain you walk up) and you can stay there overnight (they even have double rooms and serve three meals a day), making it an ideal location to explore the various surrounding peaks or just wander along the plateau. June would also be a good time to see all the Alpine flora in full flow. You should also be able to see some Chamois and I know of some people who heard and saw stags up there. The other area worthwhile visiting is the Steinerne Meer, which you can reach from St. Bartholomew, behind Koenigsee (near Berchtesgaden). There are also a range of mountain huts, and you could just wander from one to the other. Enjoy!<br>Barbara Madigan</p> <p>\u0095 I am loath to mention this, as I want the place to myself, but I really must recommend the Canary islands. Germans have known about the walking country there for ages, but the British seem widely ignorant of the other side of these islands. The north side of Tenerife is the place to go - the Anaga pensinsula in the east and the Teno in the west are lush, verdant volcanic areas with astonishing views and clearly marked paths. A short ferry-ride away is La Gomera - an utterly gorgeous and unspoilt island, and my favourite place in the world so far (there are still a few islands in the archepelago I've not visited yet). If you don't believe me, search out the excellent Sunflower guides in any bookshop and have a look at the pictures. These places are cheap and easy to get to and (another seemingly little known fact) real Canarian cuisine and wine are wonderful and the people, once you get away from the resorts, are shy but friendly and helpful. I'm off there myself in a few days.<br> Chris Whiteley</p>",

Ken Baldry \u0095 Although all the European mountains have interesting wild flowers, for accessibility, number of species and spectacular scenery, the Dolomites are my first choice. Try Dobbiaco (or Toblach as it is also known) in the German-speaking region as a base. There are low-level walks near the town in meadows and woods, but to see the biggest range, take a car to the passes and refuges. You can drive up to the Tre Cima at around 2100m or the Auronzo Rifugio (2298m) where there are excellent paths that aren't too strenuous. You'll see many of the Dolomite specialities like the Devil's Claw and poppies within easy reach. The scenery at the Tre Cima is magical. Further south, I wouldn't miss the Pordoi pass. If you want a more southerly base try Cortina. The last week of June is probably the earliest to go but I prefer the first two weeks in July to see the best range of flowers. Alan Davison \u0095 I would strongly recommend the Cevennes as a walking area. The scenery is splendid and there is a good network of well signed Grandes Randonees giving a choice of easy or strenuous out and back or circular routes accessible from roadside parking. With three companions in our 50s and 60s, I had an excellent holiday there in 1994, staying in a converted hilltop fortress - the Castella - near St Bonnet, booked through Vacances in Campagne - and the weather was superb! Michael Miller \u0095 Last year, my husband and I stayed in a lovely chalet in a small village called Manigod, which is about 20 minutes drive from Annecy in the Haute Savoie in France. There were superb walks and trails around the mountains and through the forests and valleys, all within easy access by foot or vehicle from the chalet, and with varying standards of difficulty. You should possibly allow longer than the local guidebooks recommend for these walks to allow time to enjoy the view, sniff the flowers (and take a few breathers!) We booked through Brittany Ferries, who have several g\u00eetes in the area. Good luck! Carolyn Scallan \u0095 We went to the village of Auffach in Wildsch\u00f6nau, Austria, in June 1999. The flowers and the meadows were beautiful. There are at least two gondolas in the valley which allow you to gain altitude easily, and help towards the wilder places. There were some fairly long days' walking, but a pleasant Pension in the village to return to each evening. We went with Waymark, and were very happy with all the arrangements. Colin and Cyndy Patey \u0095 Last year we visited Slovenia and walked in the Julian Alps and Karavanke range close to the magical resort of Lake Bled. The warm climate produces a higher tree line than in other parts of the Alps, with deciduous trees predominating over evergreens. The abundance of wild flowers on the walks led to slow progress as the flora enthusiasts paused to identify them. We walked with a friendly local company, Koren Sports, whose programme is available through Freedom of Slovenia (www.humanfish.com) and Slovenija Pursuits (0870 2 200 201). They offer adventure sports, trekking and a number of day walks, including transport to reduce the amount of climbing. John Cresswell and Sharon Smith \u0095 June is rather early for walking in the Alps as some paths are likely still to be blocked by snow, but it is lovely for flowers. Four years ago we flew into Zurich and took the train to Pontresina, thinking that the weather and snow conditions would be best in the south. The railway journey on the Rhaetische Bahn is an experience in itself, and Pontresina is an excellent centre as it is at the hub of several radiating valleys. One can walk straight out along the Val Rosegg, getting wonderful views of the high peaks, or take the bus or train for a few miles along another valley and walk back. For a different level, there is the Muottas Muragl funicular, and here we followed the retreating snow for soldanella and other delights. If the weather is bad one can take the fantastically engineered railway over the pass into Italy for the day. After a few days, we went north to the Swiss National Park, where marmots and deer are virtually guaranteed, and lammergeier have been reintroduced, though we didn't see any. Here we had more good walking, straight out of the hotel and using the bus. Working our way back in the general direction of Zurich, we spent a few days at Wengen, and although the famous views were mostly hidden in the clouds, the lower level walking was not affected, and the flower meadows were wonderful. If the weather turns really bad, as it did for us, it is a good idea to try the Valais, where there is often a strip of sunshine along the Rhone, and have a couple of nights at Sion to see the castles. Alternatively, there is usually good weather, and good walking, in the Ticino, which can be reached by other interesting railways. This is in-between-season for the Alps, and some hotels and guesthouses are closed, but those that are open are very welcoming, and half-board (three nights minimum) at the cheaper Swiss hotels is invariably a good buy. It is never necessary to book in advance. Il Fuorn in the National Park was more expensive than the hotels where we normally stay, but not to be missed as it is in the middle of wonderful country. When we arrived at Wengen, as usual we looked for the cheapest hotel, and it turned out to be their rest day. The door was open, and a number to ring left by the telephone. So we rang, and a voice told us to take a room key and make ourselves at home! At Sion, it was rest day when we left, so we were given the hotel key and asked to lock up before we departed! We have many other happy memories of Swiss hotels and hoteliers, while for walking, Switzerland is our favourite country. Despite its reputation, it is not unduly expensive. Rosemary and Derek Moore \u0095 My wife and I (now aged 64 &amp; 69) have been walking and climbing in the various mountains of Europe for about 25 years and it is our considered opinion that if somewhere is a 'beautiful wild area' as sought after by Peter Adams and is also accessible without some hard work on foot, then it is immediately filled up with people and hotels, destroying the thing that made the place attractive in the first place. However, let's have a try. The Ordesa (not Odessa) National Park in the Pyrenees is as good a place as you can get and is really fairly easy walking but if that is too tough then one could try the other end of the same range. There is a small French village called Py approachable from Villefranche de Confluent on the N116 west of Perpignan and the surrounding area has narrow valleys which are a paradise for butterflies. There is also 'Le Canigou', the highest point in Catalonia. Above Py is the tiny hamlet of Mantet, also a possibility. These places do not at present have much accommodation but are feasible as days out by car and on foot from the main road. Another possibility might be the Massif Central which resembles the English Lake District without lakes; it may be crowded in the French holiday periods. Better, in June, might be the Queyras, the mountain group south-east of Briancon. This is a large district and has some considerable mountains on the border between France and Italy but accessible by car there are many delightful valleys with fairly uncrowded excursions. Drive up the D902 out of Guillestre (off the N94 south of Briancon), the route splits here and you can go up the Combe du Queyras to Chateau-Queyras and other villages (try St Veran) or towards the Val d'Escreins Nature Reserve (hotels unlikely) or St Marcellin and Les Claux. West of Briancon are the Dauphine Alps (National Parc Les Ecrins). These are wonderful for wildlife but may be too rugged if one finds Ordesa a bit hard. There is, however, the Vosges, between Nancy and Mulhouse; rather a lot of coniferous forests but easy walking and good hotels with gargantuan repasts. Or the Vanoise National Park around Pralognan, which has NO ski lifts. Further afield there are the Italian Dolomites. The valleys around Alleghe or Caprile have walks in mixed forest (but try the Val d'Ombretta) but also small hills with breathtaking views of the bigger mountains. An alternative might be the (German-speaking although Italian) Pustertal - Val Pusteria at the extreme north of the region; several nice teutonic towns e.g. Innichen (Sn Candido), Sexten, Toblach (Dobbiaco) and so on and there are easy walks to the Austrian frontier which are almost deserted. But if you want peace and quiet you must be prepared to work for it; the unspoilt, undiscovered, easy mountain country of the Victorians has been discovered and, I regret, spoilt. Alan Travis Braddock \u0095 We recommend the Vercours, a region of limestone hills, forest and pasture featured in the Guardian in June 1990. We travelled by TGV to Grenoble (we could have flown or driven our car). We were armed with a 50,000 map \"Itineraires de Randonnees\" sheet 12 and the \"Topo-Guide\" for France's long distance footpaths GR 9, 91,93, 95, in French. We took the rather sparse bus service westwards out of town and walked south on the GR91 to small villages and towns each having a modest but comfortable hotel. This form of lodging minimised the weight of our rucksacks. Daily distances were not excessive, usually less than 1000m vertical and 20Km horizontal. I particularly recall the delightful ambience of the Hotel Val Fleuri in Lans-en-Vercours and the spectacular location of the Hotel du col de la Machine. On two occasions we hired bicycles by way of a change. Returning along GR9 we visited the impressive Grottes de Choranche. John and Sylvia Faichney \u0095 How about the Alta Pusteria Valley in the Italian Dolomites? We've been going for 10 years. Very accessible by road and rail from airports such as Verona.Excellent local bus services and excursions if you want a 'day off'. Very helpful local tourist offices. Super hotels, guest houses and apartments in all categories. Wonderful local cuisine and wines, no high rise or modern buildings. We recommend Sesto or Dobbiaco which are well served by cable cars if you wish to do some high walking, but there are excellent waymarked paths on the flat through meadows filled with wild flowers plus river walks. Mainly a winter ski valley, but it excels in summer from mid-May and most hotels do 'Green week' packages which are great value. Janice Carrera \u0095 Austria is just the right place for you. The Alps in the Eastern part of Austria (2000 metres) are a well-kept secret. You will find lush vegetation and spectacular views, but also cable cars and chairlifts which allow you to choose how much or little you want to walk. I recommend Puchberg/Schneeberg or Prein/Rax as a base. And if you are fed up with walking, Vienna is just an hour's drive away. Fatima Martin \u0095 We have had many wonderful early summer walks in south-eastern Switzerland. The villages and small towns at 1000 - 1500m above sea level are ideal at that time, and most have hotels or inns, and excellent post bus connections to the main station in Chur. Arosa, Lenzerheide and Savonign are all pleasant towns with many walks; but for somewhere really quiet, one of our favourites is a small village called Tschiertschen. It sits on the side of a valley and is surrounded by meadows and woods, with the open high alp above. The seasons vary, but if you are lucky, in early June you can walk in a couple of hours from meadows in full flower up to crocuses just breaking through the snow. Wild life includes deer, chamois and steinbock. Not a suitable place, however, if you want level walking - or exciting night life. J Post \u0095 I suggest Crans-Montana near Sierre in the Rhone valley, Switzerland. There are all sorts of walks starting from there, at all grades of difficulty. The easiest are very pleasant strolls and the longer ones can take you to 10000 feet. The walks are well marked and mapped. There is no shortage of alpine meadows with abundant flora - and the\"reines de Vallais\", as the local cows are known, are on the mountain pastures, bells clanging furiously. Placid creatures they are not, but fortunately they take it out on each other. Alpine choughs were all round us on one walk. The surrounding scenery in every direction is magnificent-snowy peaks in all directions. Not only that, but a bus service (free) will take you from the town to Vermala, which is a main starting and finishing point for the walks. Every day can provide breakfast in a hotel, a great walk, and back for dinner. The ski gondolas will even be working, if you don't fancy walking up, or back down. Civilised, but breathtaking. Elizabeth Wood \u0095 The Picos de Europa in northern Spain would fit the bill perfectly. The wildlife in this Dartmoor-sized area is wonderful and the mountains are beautiful beyond compare.

      "body": "<p>Without higher education, few of the present Cabinet would have risen to the positions they hold today. As Tony Blair\u00eas first administration draws to its expected close, it is timely to consider whether new Labour has left the sector in better shape than when elected in 1997. But first, what has higher education done for today\u00eas crop of senior ministers?</p> <p>Of the Blair Cabinet, 20 studied at university or polytechnic. They're quite brainy, too - four have doctorates, five were barristers and six have worked in higher education as lecturers or tutors.</p> <p>Some have had further to rise than others. Deputy prime minister John Prescott was a seaman in the merchant navy before studying at Ruskin College, Oxford, and Hull University. Northern Ireland secretary Dr John Reid worked as a labourer and insurance clerk prior to gaining a degree in history and a PhD in economic history from Strathclyde University.</p> <p>The Cabinet's university pedigree also stretches wider than the traditional Oxbridge stable. Eight of Blair's senior ministers form the 'Scottish and Newcastle' tendency. Not a reference to brewing - although several Cabinet members list the parliamentary Beer Club among their activities - but recognition of the number who went to university in Scotland and the north-east of England. The government minister with perhaps the strongest track record in the sector, education minister Baroness Blackstone, has yet to make it into the Cabinet. Blackstone, whose responsibilities include higher education and student support, has a PhD from the London School of Economics. She taught at the LSE, became professor of educational administration at London University's Institute of Education and was Master of Birkbeck College for 10 years before joining the government.</p> <p>With ministers of Blackstone's standing outside the Cabinet, and a wealth of graduates and ex-academics inside, the outlook for higher education under Labour looked promising. Better still, there was the pre-election cry of 'education, education, education', and the 1997 manifesto pledge: 'Education will be our number one priority.'</p> <p>But has higher education really benefited under new Labour? Less than three months after victory in the 1997 election, Labour decided to end the maintenance grant and introduce up-front tuition fees for undergraduates. This was in spite of the recommendations of that year's Dearing report, which advocated a student support regime based on a 50-50 mix of grants and loans and the introduction of fees paid retrospectively by graduates once their income had reached a certain level.</p> <p>Up-front tuition fees were introduced in autumn 1998, and the maintenance grant was phased out in 1999. But it was not long before the cracks began to show. A report into student income and expenditure by Claire Callender and Martin Kemp found that by the end of the 1998-99 academic year, full-time students anticipated owing three times as much as students in 1995-96. The average loan taken out by students in 1998-99 was twice that taken out in 1995-96, and loan take-up was greatest among single parents.</p> <p>It was perhaps inevitable that the new funding regime would affect participation in higher education.

      "bodyText": "Without higher education, few of the present Cabinet would have risen to the positions they hold today. As Tony Blair\u00eas first administration draws to its expected close, it is timely to consider whether new Labour has left the sector in better shape than when elected in 1997. But first, what has higher education done for today\u00eas crop of senior ministers? Of the Blair Cabinet, 20 studied at university or polytechnic. They're quite brainy, too - four have doctorates, five were barristers and six have worked in higher education as lecturers or tutors. Some have had further to rise than others. Deputy prime minister John Prescott was a seaman in the merchant navy before studying at Ruskin College, Oxford, and Hull University. Northern Ireland secretary Dr John Reid worked as a labourer and insurance clerk prior to gaining a degree in history and a PhD in economic history from Strathclyde University. The Cabinet's university pedigree also stretches wider than the traditional Oxbridge stable. Eight of Blair's senior ministers form the 'Scottish and Newcastle' tendency. Not a reference to brewing - although several Cabinet members list the parliamentary Beer Club among their activities - but recognition of the number who went to university in Scotland and the north-east of England. The government minister with perhaps the strongest track record in the sector, education minister Baroness Blackstone, has yet to make it into the Cabinet. Blackstone, whose responsibilities include higher education and student support, has a PhD from the London School of Economics. She taught at the LSE, became professor of educational administration at London University's Institute of Education and was Master of Birkbeck College for 10 years before joining the government. With ministers of Blackstone's standing outside the Cabinet, and a wealth of graduates and ex-academics inside, the outlook for higher education under Labour looked promising. Better still, there was the pre-election cry of 'education, education, education', and the 1997 manifesto pledge: 'Education will be our number one priority.' But has higher education really benefited under new Labour? Less than three months after victory in the 1997 election, Labour decided to end the maintenance grant and introduce up-front tuition fees for undergraduates. This was in spite of the recommendations of that year's Dearing report, which advocated a student support regime based on a 50-50 mix of grants and loans and the introduction of fees paid retrospectively by graduates once their income had reached a certain level. Up-front tuition fees were introduced in autumn 1998, and the maintenance grant was phased out in 1999. But it was not long before the cracks began to show. A report into student income and expenditure by Claire Callender and Martin Kemp found that by the end of the 1998-99 academic year, full-time students anticipated owing three times as much as students in 1995-96. The average loan taken out by students in 1998-99 was twice that taken out in 1995-96, and loan take-up was greatest among single parents. It was perhaps inevitable that the new funding regime would affect participation in higher education. While the number of students under 21 has continued to increase in the UK since the introduction of fees and abolition of grants, applications from those aged 21 and over have dropped. David Blunkett's regime lasted only two years in Scotland. In autumn 2000, up-front fees were abolished and replaced with an income-contingent endowment payable after graduation. From this year, means-tested, non-repayable access bursaries will be available for young students from poor families, and there will be discretionary bursaries for mature students. The reason, according to the Scottish Executive, was that high levels of debt could be a disincentive to students from lower-income families. The impact on students suggests strongly that Labour's decision to grasp the funding nettle in 1997 was hasty and ill-thought out. This verdict is borne out by the government's move to raise to 50% the proportion of students in England who will now be exempt from fees. What about higher education institutions themselves? In general, things have improved. The level of government grant has gradually increased under Labour, ending the damaging years of cuts in real terms to the unit of funding per student. In 2001-2, in England and Scotland, the unit is set to increase above the inflation rate. And in the three years to 2004 there will be an additional \u00a31bn poured into the science budget for institutions' research infrastructure, three-quarters of which is coming from the government. Nevertheless, evidence of recruitment and retention problems among academic and academic-related staff continues to grow. The main problem is pay, which in recent years has barely kept pace with inflation and has fallen way behind comparable jobs in other sectors. Another is the ever-increasing burden of bureaucracy, which has intensified under the assessment system set in place after the Dearing report. As for what the future holds, the government has acted on its pre-election commitment to widen access, announcing in 1999 its aim to have 50% of school-leavers going on to higher education by 2010. There have been various initiatives to improve lower socio-economic group access to higher education, particularly since Gordon Brown's attack last year on universities over alleged elitism in the Laura Spence case. But Labour's long-term plans for university expansion have yet to be costed. And any further rise in student numbers will surely mean a return to cuts in the unit of funding.

The issues of student debt and retention, and the impact of Labour's funding arrangements on participation by mature students, are increasingly matters of concern. Moves in Wales and Northern Ireland to follow Scotland's student support system could put pressure on the next government to undo Blunkett's settlement. This would make higher education more attractive to prospective students, but surely not as attractive as it was in the era of the full grant, when most of the current Cabinet were at university.

Rabbi Tony Bayfield, the movement's chief executive, says it has launched a recruitment campaign to persuade young members to think of studying for the rabbinate.

He says they had no difficulty recruiting seven students this year and were able to reject 10 others for lacking the requisite technical background. </p> <p>Some within the Jewish community suggest there may be a problem with young Orthodox rabbis who are out of sympathy and understanding with the cultural and social mores of their flocks, but Weiss denies this. 'If anything, I am worried about overproduction - there is a limited community in Britain,' he says. Even Orthodox rabbis these days need training in subjects such as time management, fund-raising and counselling, and the college is negotiating to establish a new pastoral theology course with Heythrop College, which may well be shared in an ecumenical fashion with trainees from other religions. In modern theological training, at least, some differences are being set aside.</p>",

He says they had no difficulty recruiting seven students this year and were able to reject 10 others for lacking the requisite technical background. Some within the Jewish community suggest there may be a problem with young Orthodox rabbis who are out of sympathy and understanding with the cultural and social mores of their flocks, but Weiss denies this. 'If anything, I am worried about overproduction - there is a limited community in Britain,' he says. Even Orthodox rabbis these days need training in subjects such as time management, fund-raising and counselling, and the college is negotiating to establish a new pastoral theology course with Heythrop College, which may well be shared in an ecumenical fashion with trainees from other religions. In modern theological training, at least, some differences are being set aside.",

      "bodyText": "The National Union of Teachers' conference yesterday endorsed a tougher stance over pupil exclusion by threatening strike action to protect staff from violent and disruptive children. Delegates in Cardiff voted for the scrapping of \"arbitrary and bureaucratic\" government targets to reduce exclusions. They also called for the replacement of the independent appeals panels, which have the power to reinstate excluded pupils, by locally elected panels including teachers and headteachers among their membership. Historically the NUT has taken a less hardline view of pupil exclusion than rival unions, particularly the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, which will debate the issue at its conference in Jersey today and is set to endorse a similar motion. The NUT leadership announced in November it was advising teachers they could threaten strike action if headteachers refused to exclude pupils or if exclusion appeals panels overturned decisions. The union represented members in 120 cases where pupils were being reinstated against the will of teachers. Of those cases, 76 resulted in the members refusing to teach. The union has not yet threatened to strike but the conference decision endorses the retention of that as a last resort. In a survey by the NUT's Gravesham branch of 42 schools, 11 said they had pupils who should be excluded because of behavioural difficulties. The government is committed to reducing the number of exclusions from schools by one-third by 2002 from the 1996-97 figure of 12,700. The education secretary, David Blunkett, was forced to revise guidance on exclusions after fierce protests from head teachers that appeals panels were reinstating too many pupils. A spokesman for the education department said: \"The secretary of state has made it very clear that where head teachers feel the need to exclude a child, that judgment must be upheld.\" Conference also called for more support for teachers facing pupils with threatening and challenging behaviour. The union revealed details of a \u00a337,000 award this month to Jo Daws, 57, a teacher at Beckmead, a school for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties in Croydon, south London, after her back was damaged by having to deal with disruptive pupils. She was forced to give up teaching in December 1996. Central London county court found the school had inadequate and inconsistent procedures for dealing with poor behaviour.

Her husband Patrick works with computer systems.</strong></p> <p>I went into teaching because I thought it would be a creative career and spent my first year in a very difficult school in Peckham - it was a real baptism of fire. Then I spent nearly five years in a primary school in Swindon, which I loved. It had a charismatic head and was very exciting.</p> <p>But it was a very demanding job. I'd get in at 7.30am and leave at 6pm, taking two hours of work home with me. I also spent up to \u00a350 a month on various resources for the classroom. When I got married, my husband and I were on the same salary. Four years later, his salary had doubled and mine had only crept up. When I became pregnant, I didn't know how I could possibly have children and teach because it took so much out of my time. I hated the thought of doing it badly. Also, there were a lot of changes that year, including much more paperwork, which wasn't my cup of tea. I was a creative teacher and this was crushing. I began to feel a bit of a failure.</p> <p>So I gave up teaching when Jacob was born in 1993 and started doing more creative things from home. Soon, I got a toe in illustrating and designing greeting cards. Now I run a course in developing arts and crafts for other women who are at home.

It's a little thing, but it used to really piss me off. </p> <p>Even though the proposals are a welcome gesture, and there are certainly good things in the package, it is far more important to reward those who choose to stay than to drag people back with sweeteners.</p> <p><strong>A former education manager with Lewisham LEA, Beverley Clarke-Brown (44) has two daughters, who are aged 14 and 10.

I went into teaching because I thought it would be a creative career and spent my first year in a very difficult school in Peckham - it was a real baptism of fire. Then I spent nearly five years in a primary school in Swindon, which I loved. It had a charismatic head and was very exciting. But it was a very demanding job. I'd get in at 7.30am and leave at 6pm, taking two hours of work home with me. I also spent up to \u00a350 a month on various resources for the classroom. When I got married, my husband and I were on the same salary. Four years later, his salary had doubled and mine had only crept up. When I became pregnant, I didn't know how I could possibly have children and teach because it took so much out of my time. I hated the thought of doing it badly. Also, there were a lot of changes that year, including much more paperwork, which wasn't my cup of tea. I was a creative teacher and this was crushing. I began to feel a bit of a failure.

Everyone wanted to be my friend; offering me Smarties and bits of liquorice. I was flushed with pride at being the centre of attention, I felt as exotic as a cheetah.</p> <p>'Is there electricity where you come from?' the children asked. They were all white, ruddy-cheeked and big-boned. 'Do you live in a jungle?'</p> <p>As an eight-year-old the questions merely seemed na\u00b4ve. 'Of course there\u00eas electricity in India,' I replied. 'It's just like England but hotter.' I told my mum I liked my new school. The kids were really friendly. But over the next few days my new friends dropped away. By the end of the week no one would talk to me.</p> <p>My primary school was in a tiny Hampshire village and I was the only 'coloured' person most of the children had ever met. I was small and scrawny, I couldn\u00eat run and keep up with games. This helped them to mark me down as part of a weak species. When they saw me their frames of reference were It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Jungle Book. But for me they represented all the glamour of Mallory Towers and the Famous Five.</p> <p>It took only a few weeks for me to be totally ostracised. Breaks became an agony as gangs of kids gathered round me in the playground to taunt me with cries of Brown Sugar and Nig-Nog.

Everyone wanted to be my friend; offering me Smarties and bits of liquorice. I was flushed with pride at being the centre of attention, I felt as exotic as a cheetah. 'Is there electricity where you come from?' the children asked. They were all white, ruddy-cheeked and big-boned. 'Do you live in a jungle?' As an eight-year-old the questions merely seemed na\u00b4ve. 'Of course there\u00eas electricity in India,' I replied. 'It's just like England but hotter.' I told my mum I liked my new school. The kids were really friendly. But over the next few days my new friends dropped away. By the end of the week no one would talk to me. My primary school was in a tiny Hampshire village and I was the only 'coloured' person most of the children had ever met. I was small and scrawny, I couldn\u00eat run and keep up with games. This helped them to mark me down as part of a weak species. When they saw me their frames of reference were It Ain't Half Hot Mum and Jungle Book. But for me they represented all the glamour of Mallory Towers and the Famous Five. It took only a few weeks for me to be totally ostracised. Breaks became an agony as gangs of kids gathered round me in the playground to taunt me with cries of Brown Sugar and Nig-Nog. They would sing the hit Boney M song, Brown Girl In The Ring, as they spun round and round me. I don\u00eat recall any of the teachers intervening to stop the bullying \u00e3 which must have been apparent to even the most myopic playground supervisor.

      "body": "<p>It is rare that the death of a publisher should be seen as an event of national importance. But the death from cancer of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lindon, at the age of 75, has aroused considerable emotion in France. Lindon's publishing house, Les Editions de Minuit, is not a big organisation; it publishes some 20 books a year, it has a staff of 10, and while it is no longer on the verge of bankruptcy, its profits are modest.</p> <p>Lindon made Les Editions de Minuit's postwar reputation. He did this by his taste for fine writing, his flair for seeing what was important and by the confidence that he inspired in authors. Two winners of the Nobel prize for literature, Samuel Beckett and Claude Simon, were published by him, many novels on his lists were awarded the prix Goncourt, and in the world of fiction, philosophy and social thinking, he dominated French cultural and intellectual life in the latter half of the 20th century.</p> <p>Then there was Marguerite Duras. With her turbulent private life and her creative energy, few authors could be as difficult as she. By 1957, she had published five novels with Gallimard. But when she finished Moderato Cantabile, she became aware of her dissatisfaction with those who seemed to publish her automatically and who, she suspected, never read her.</p> <p>Lindon understood her. He told her, on the very night she delivered her manuscript, that he would read it and discuss it with her the next morning. This he did. Duras decided that she preferred the energy and the enthusiasm of a man who loved books to the daily round of a sacrosanct institution such as Gallimard. The book was published in 1958 and won the prix de Mai awarded by the St Germain bookshop, La Hune.</p> <p>Lindon was born in Paris, into a family with Polish-Jewish origins. His father, a lawyer, was a nephew of Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn, related to the Dreyfus and Bergson families: this was the well-connected Jewish upper bourgeoisie that had become totally French. As he was 14 at the outbreak of war in 1939, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was not called up, but in 1942 he joined the resistance movement, Combat.</p> <p>That February the clandestine novel, Le Silence de la Mer, a token of resistance to the Germans written by Vercors (Jean Bruller), was published. It marked the founding of the hidden publishing house - by Vercors and another member of the resistance, Pierre de Lescure - that took the appropriate name of Les Editions de Minuit, since it functioned in the depths of night, and produced some 24 further novels in wartime.</p> <p>In 1946, when Lindon joined Vercors, the firm was distinctly shaky. Thanks to money invested by the Lindon family, bankruptcy was avoided. Vercors left, and by the end of 1948 Lindon, at 23, had become the director, a position he occupied for the next 53 years.</p> <p>At a time when Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus dominated French literature, Lindon was confident that there was a new avant-garde and that he knew how to find it. In 1950, Samuel Beckett sent him the manuscript of his novel Molloy, which had suffered five rejections elsewhere but which Lindon published in 1951; in 1953, he followed this with Les Gommes by Alain Robbe-Grillet. Soon there sprang up a group of authors who rejected traditional methods of writing. Pioneers of the nouveau roman, they were christened the \"new novelists\".</p> <p>But the name was not accepted by everyone. It was suggested that, since the real link between them was their progressive publisher, they should be known as the \"\u00e9cole de minuit\", and one American literary review published a survey of these authors under the heading of the \"Midnight Novelists\".</p> <p>Lindon published philosophers who were to make their names in the years that followed - Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, the social specialist Pierre Bourdieu - as well as the reviews Critique and Arguments. And as he believed in intellectual freedom, so he believed in political freedom, and he played an important role in criticisms of the French army in the Algerian war in the late 1950s. He published attacks and petitions against the use of torture that led him into conflict with the government.</p> <p>From the small building in the Rue Bernard-Palissy in the St Germain quarter of Paris, Lindon defended publishers against intense commercialisation and later prepared to defend them against the internet.</p> <p>After Lindon's death, President Chirac commented on his unique role and lamented the loss of a friend.

      "bodyText": "It is rare that the death of a publisher should be seen as an event of national importance. But the death from cancer of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lindon, at the age of 75, has aroused considerable emotion in France. Lindon's publishing house, Les Editions de Minuit, is not a big organisation; it publishes some 20 books a year, it has a staff of 10, and while it is no longer on the verge of bankruptcy, its profits are modest. Lindon made Les Editions de Minuit's postwar reputation. He did this by his taste for fine writing, his flair for seeing what was important and by the confidence that he inspired in authors. Two winners of the Nobel prize for literature, Samuel Beckett and Claude Simon, were published by him, many novels on his lists were awarded the prix Goncourt, and in the world of fiction, philosophy and social thinking, he dominated French cultural and intellectual life in the latter half of the 20th century. Then there was Marguerite Duras. With her turbulent private life and her creative energy, few authors could be as difficult as she. By 1957, she had published five novels with Gallimard. But when she finished Moderato Cantabile, she became aware of her dissatisfaction with those who seemed to publish her automatically and who, she suspected, never read her. Lindon understood her. He told her, on the very night she delivered her manuscript, that he would read it and discuss it with her the next morning. This he did. Duras decided that she preferred the energy and the enthusiasm of a man who loved books to the daily round of a sacrosanct institution such as Gallimard. The book was published in 1958 and won the prix de Mai awarded by the St Germain bookshop, La Hune. Lindon was born in Paris, into a family with Polish-Jewish origins. His father, a lawyer, was a nephew of Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn, related to the Dreyfus and Bergson families: this was the well-connected Jewish upper bourgeoisie that had become totally French. As he was 14 at the outbreak of war in 1939, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was not called up, but in 1942 he joined the resistance movement, Combat. That February the clandestine novel, Le Silence de la Mer, a token of resistance to the Germans written by Vercors (Jean Bruller), was published. It marked the founding of the hidden publishing house - by Vercors and another member of the resistance, Pierre de Lescure - that took the appropriate name of Les Editions de Minuit, since it functioned in the depths of night, and produced some 24 further novels in wartime. In 1946, when Lindon joined Vercors, the firm was distinctly shaky. Thanks to money invested by the Lindon family, bankruptcy was avoided. Vercors left, and by the end of 1948 Lindon, at 23, had become the director, a position he occupied for the next 53 years. At a time when Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus dominated French literature, Lindon was confident that there was a new avant-garde and that he knew how to find it. In 1950, Samuel Beckett sent him the manuscript of his novel Molloy, which had suffered five rejections elsewhere but which Lindon published in 1951; in 1953, he followed this with Les Gommes by Alain Robbe-Grillet. Soon there sprang up a group of authors who rejected traditional methods of writing. Pioneers of the nouveau roman, they were christened the \"new novelists\". But the name was not accepted by everyone. It was suggested that, since the real link between them was their progressive publisher, they should be known as the \"\u00e9cole de minuit\", and one American literary review published a survey of these authors under the heading of the \"Midnight Novelists\". Lindon published philosophers who were to make their names in the years that followed - Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, the social specialist Pierre Bourdieu - as well as the reviews Critique and Arguments. And as he believed in intellectual freedom, so he believed in political freedom, and he played an important role in criticisms of the French army in the Algerian war in the late 1950s. He published attacks and petitions against the use of torture that led him into conflict with the government. From the small building in the Rue Bernard-Palissy in the St Germain quarter of Paris, Lindon defended publishers against intense commercialisation and later prepared to defend them against the internet. After Lindon's death, President Chirac commented on his unique role and lamented the loss of a friend. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the ministers for culture and education, and writers such as Robbe-Grillet and Simon paid tribute to him, as did fellow publisher Gallimard. In a rare gesture, Le Monde devoted its leading article to him while Lib\u00e9ration gave him four pages. He was buried in Montparnasse in a grave near that of his friend, Samuel Beckett. He is survived by his wife Annette, his two sons, Andr\u00e9 and Matthieu, and his daughter Ir\u00e8ne, who is now managing director of the publishing house. \u0095 J\u008er\u00f4me Lindon, publisher, born June 9 1925; died April 9 2001",

The result was put beyond doubt in the 63rd minute when Inter's defence stood and watched an Inzaghi cross reach Del Piero and the Juve captain drove home, with the help of a deflection off Inter defender Laurent Blanc. </p> <p><strong>AC MILAN 3 UDINESE 0 </strong></p> <p>Georgian defnder Kakha Kaladze scored a scrappy opener for Milan but their other two goals were pearls.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to council finance, the current government has proved to be ultra cautious. That could be about to change. </p> <p>During the summer ministers will put out to consultation what is potentially one of the most important local government reforms Labour has made since coming to power. They are considering giving councils the chance to speculate on the money markets.</p> <p>A final decision is expected by the autumn and the Treasury, always the most important and difficult department to convince, is thought to be keen on the idea.</p> <p>If ministers give the go-ahead they could create a \u00a315bn market by allowing local authorities to invest spare public cash, gained from sources including council house sales, in financial instruments such as corporate bonds, money market funds and commercial paper - a short-term corporate investment.</p> <p>The move to consult is a result of ongoing high-level discussions between officials from the Treasury, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and local government officials.</p> <p>On face value the decision to allow taxpayers' money to be invested by local authority treasurers is highly contentious - history is not on the side of local government. In the 1980s and 1990s, some councils lost heavily on the market.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to council finance, the current government has proved to be ultra cautious. That could be about to change. During the summer ministers will put out to consultation what is potentially one of the most important local government reforms Labour has made since coming to power. They are considering giving councils the chance to speculate on the money markets. A final decision is expected by the autumn and the Treasury, always the most important and difficult department to convince, is thought to be keen on the idea. If ministers give the go-ahead they could create a \u00a315bn market by allowing local authorities to invest spare public cash, gained from sources including council house sales, in financial instruments such as corporate bonds, money market funds and commercial paper - a short-term corporate investment. The move to consult is a result of ongoing high-level discussions between officials from the Treasury, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and local government officials. On face value the decision to allow taxpayers' money to be invested by local authority treasurers is highly contentious - history is not on the side of local government. In the 1980s and 1990s, some councils lost heavily on the market. The London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is commonly thought to have lost millions throughout the 1980s - a claim the authority denies. The enthusiasm with which Hammersmith and Fulham embraced the market is clear. At one stage it was the third largest trader in the country, with almost 600 transactions made between 1983 and 1989, enthusiastically investing in financial instruments such as swaps and gilt options - bonds issued by the government. In 1991, the high court ruled that the council had exceeded its powers and that such trading was illegal, leaving banks that it had invested in to pick up a bill running into millions. Hammersmith and Fulham says that not a penny of taxpayer's money was lost, and at the time of the high court ruling it held almost \u00a315m in reserve accounts from money it had traded. Another authority courting controversy was the Western Isles council. It lost \u00a324m with the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. One of the results of this was the tightening of regulations on the types of investments councils could make. The Approved Investment Regulations specified where councils could and could not put their surplus cash. They encourage councils to invest in government-backed instruments, such as short-term deposits with national banks, such as the Bank of England, rather than more speculative assets such as equities. Any council that does not comply with these regulations and instead invests in a non-approved instrument has to use 50% of any yield to pay off debt - a strong disincentive to many. However, local government officials argue that investments such as money market funds - a portfolio of short-term securities - would be less risky as they are triple-A rated, the highest form of security rating given by the City, than some of the banks councils currently put money into. They are also easy to invest in. Seen as a short-term investment, a council treasurer could invest for a period as short as 24 hours. A minimum amount, anywhere between \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000 would have to be invested. Such arguments appear to be winning over some in government and councils accept that any changes would have to come with new regulation. \"We are not wishing to allow local authorities to use inappropriate risky investments,\" says Martin Easton, capital policy adviser with the Local Government Association. \"We will be expecting to stick to investments of the highest quality and the investment types under the new regulations.\" This means, says Mr Easton, that councils will \"certainly not\" be allowed to invest in equities or derivatives. Authorities likely to benefit most from any change in the rules would be district councils who have shed their housing stocks, are largely debt-free and want to make returns on short-term investments. Eyeing this new and potentially big market is the City. Marc Doman, managing director of AIM Global, a specialised money market fund provider that is part of Invesco Asset Management, says it is time the current regulations are relaxed. \"Over the last 10 years these have become very outdated and very restrictive.

The speed with which a pub fracas became a matter of 'defending our area' to Asian youths in the usually quiet quarter of Lidget Green lends weight to the panel's warnings of \"growing ghetto-isation\" in the Yorkshire city. You could see the process in action on Legrams Lane, the commuter route from Halifax that passes all three battered pubs, the day after the brief but furious outbreak of violence. Defiant young men recounted how \"invading skinheads from out of town\" had been seen off, while older residents mourned that \"this used to be such a nice area\". Actually it still is. The Coach House, where the trouble began, is far from being the sort of inner city dive where you might expect brawls. A former farm, it still has an 18th-century dovecote built into its gritstone walls, and families often sit in the sun in its beer garden. It is also just the sort of place, in modern, multicultural Bradford, where a Hindu wedding reception would go off well; and the Indian community often uses it for such events. It was horribly anomalous that guests from just such a reception got caught up in a quarrel, then a fight, which ignited the worst window-smashing, missile-throwing and car-burning seen in Bradford since the Manningham street violence of 1995.

That is why some of Bradford's most moderate and liberal politicians are worried about the imminent prospect of a Muslim high school; a logical step, given the success of Catholic and Jewish schools, but with obvious implications for ghettoisation. The school will happen, but Lidget Green underlines the need for mixing everywhere else: at Bradford City's football ground (blessed by local imams); in the Bradford district cricket league; at the Interfaith Centre; in shops; in jobs. This is not a matter of do-gooder moralising but of hard-headed social and economic sense. Britain's best curry is only part of the great contribution to local prosperity made by second-generation Asian entrepreneurs. Bradford's excellent, cosmopolitan air is, after all, what gives it a potential edge on all other northern cities.

      "bodyText": "A leaked Tory memo warning candidates to avoid racist or religiously provocative language in the general election campaign has been seized on by Labour and Liberal Democrat activists as evidence of deep-seated prejudice in Conservative ranks. The Conservative party chairman Michael Ancram wrote to all Tory prospective parliamentary candidates in March telling them to \"avoid using language which is likely to generate racial or religious hatred.\" The need for such a memo prompted Labour MP Fraser Kemp to accuse the Tories of being \"worried about the possibilities of racial outbursts from their candidates.\" He added: \"\"It's going to take more than a memo to shift the fundamentally right-wing and bigoted opinions of today's Tory party.\" The memo was sent to all 659 conservative candidates just two days before Tory MP John Townend's comments on immigration to a constituency party came to light. Mr Townend, who is stepping down at the next election, blamed immigration for \"undermining anglo-saxon society\" and claimed that Enoch Powell would have been made prime minister if people had realised how correct his predictions were to become. He also claimed immigrants came from areas where crime was high. The letter goes on to state: \" The Conservative party is utterly opposed to racial discrimination. We believe in a Britain where what matters is your talent and effort, not the colour of your skin or who your parents were.\" Today, prospective Conservative MP for Henley, Boris Johnson, added his voice to the growing row, by calling for Mr Townend, MP for Yorkshire East, to have the whip removed. In an interview with Guardian Unlimited Mr Johnson said: \"If I were leader he would have done.\" In a damage-limitation exercise, backbench Conservative MP Peter Bottomley today claimed that the Tory party would be the first to have a black or Asian prime minister. He said: \"I suspect that in the same way that the Conservative party was the first party to have a prime minister of Jewish background, the first party to have a woman, we're quite likely to be the first to have a prominent black or Asian politician as our prime minister. \"The colour of my skin should be as important as the colour of my eyes or the colour of my hair; something you may notice but doesn't tell you any more about me,\" he added.

Dozens of angry youths took to the streets after a fight at a Hindu wedding reception triggered errant rumours of a racist attack against Muslims. Lidget Green, a quiet area of the city, was littered with broken glass yesterday and pungent with the smell of burned tyres and carpets. Extra police were on duty last night as detectives traced how an isolated scuffle escalated into stone throwing and street fighting with startling speed. A small instant response unit called to the Coach House pub - a converted farmhouse with a family garden and no record of trouble - was overwhelmed by the rapid spread of violence which led to three arson attacks. Two men were kept in Bradford infirmary overnight with facial fractures, six others suffered minor injuries. Three men, of different races, were arrested on suspicion of causing violent disorder; they were later released on police bail. Superintendent Mark Whyman, head of operations for Bradford North division, said that the groups involved in the initial fighting had been of mixed race.

Rumours of an attack on the largely Muslim neighbourhood, allegedly involving National Front members from the outlying Buttershaw estate, had spread \"instantly\" after the initial violence, said Mohammed Zahid Ibrahim. Another Asian witness, who did not want to be named, said that trouble had flared at 7.30pm on Sunday between an Indian guest at a wedding reception and a young white man drinking at the Coach House: \"The guest ran across to a takeaway pizza place on the other side of Legrams Lane and this other guy was after him, threatening to smash in the window if he didn't come out.\" Further fights broke out round the pub and windows were smashed, as the first of what Supt Whyman called \"a huge number of emergency calls in a very short space of time\" were made to police.

Though the Lebanese government predictably condemned Israel's airstrike, anyone who cares about the independence of Lebanon should be thanking Israel. \"As long as the Lebanese government does not have the power or the will to resist its exploitation by Iran and Syria, Israel will have to act against those foreign forces directly.\" The same macho mood surfaces in a commentary by former defence minister Moshe Arens for the liberal Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz. He argues that all of Israel's problems stem from the secretly negotiated Oslo agreement, which allowed Yasser Arafat to represent the Palestinians: \"There is little doubt that the Lebanon withdrawal served as fuel for the current Al-Aqsa Intifada. \"Arafat knows that Israel is capable of overcoming the Palestinian violence, but he is counting on Israel not having the staying power to handle an extended period of violence. By now it should be clear to Israel that giving in to violence is only going to lead to further violence. \"Refusing to negotiate unless the Palestinian violence ceases has become the acid test of Israel's determination to protect its interests. It is a choice between victory and defeat.\"",

The BBC1 movie premiere had just 7.4m viewers and a 31% share; while ITV's Frost repeat had 8.8m, according to unofficial overnights. BBC1 enjoyed more success with movie repeat Mrs Doubtfire, which was on between 8pm and 10pm on Thursday night. The Robin Williams vehicle drew 7.5m and a third of viewing. It lost out to Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, which had 8.8m, but beat ITV medical drama A&amp;E, with 6.5m. BBC1's big Easter drama, the Whistleblower, starring Amanda Burton as a mother who puts her family at risk from vengeful drug barons when she blows the whistle on a bank's money laundering activities, went out over two 85-minute episodes on Saturday and Sunday night. Saturday's opening instalment had 7.2m and a 32% share; but lost out to Stars in Euro Eyes with 7.6m, and Who Wants to be a Millionaire? with 8.5m. The second part on Sunday slipped back to 6.5m and 26% of the available audience, against ITV's concluding episode of Nicholas Nickleby, which had 7.1m. BBC1's new Ulrika Jonsson gameshow vehicle Dog Eat Dog had a disappointing debut on Saturday night between 6.55pm and 7.40pm. Dog Eat Dog had just 5.5m and a 27% audience share, while ITV opposition Blind Date had 6.9m. Channel 4's Easter mini-series, star-studded US import Jason and the Argonauts, proved more successful on Sunday and Monday afternoons. The first instalment had 3.3m and an 18% audience share; while the concluding episode the following day had 2.7m and a 14% share - both good ratings by Channel 4 standards. The broadcaster's Sunday ratings were also buoyed up by the terrestrial debut of Julia Roberts movie My Best Friend's Wedding, from 8.40pm. The movie had a 4.3m audience and an 18% share of viewing. Channel 4 enjoyed more Sunday success with a repeat of religious epic the Greatest Story Ever Told between 2.05pm and 5.35pm. It had 2m viewers and a 16% audience share. Yesterday it was ITV's turn to score big afternoon ratings with classic bank holiday fare, in this case the umpteenth repeat of the Great Escape. The prisoner of war escape epic had a 35% share of Monday afternoon viewing and 3.8m viewers. Related stories 17.04.2001: Rape lifts Corrie ratings 17.04.2001: TV religion proves Easter turn-off",

      "bodyText": "A national database to help vet candidates for the priesthood should be set up by the Roman Catholic church in an effort to stamp out paedophile activity, a report recommended today. No decisions on choosing would-be priests could be taken without referring to the database, under recommendations set out in the first independent report on child protection by the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales. The database would work alongside a new national child protection unit set up by the church to promote good practice and liase with other agencies. Between 1995 and 1999, 21 of the 5,600 Catholic priests in England and Wales were convicted of offences against children. Today's report, headed by Lord Nolan, a former law lord, recommended that staff, volunteers and clergy should be subjected to police checks where necessary to root out child abusers. All applicants for work in the Roman Catholic church should be asked to disclose any details of criminal offences against children and young people. The report made 50 recommendations and follows a string of damaging revelations involving paedophile priests. At a news conference in London, Lord Nolan said that aside from the \"wickedness\" of the paedophiles and the damage they had done to the victims, the scandals had caused damage to the reputation of the church. \"The care of children is at the forefront of the teachings of Christ,\" he said. \"We believe that the Catholic church in England and Wales should become an example of best practice in the prevention of child abuse and in responding to it. \"We are confident that the huge majority of church members strongly support this objective and we have been impressed by the work many are already doing to bring it about.\" The report was compiled by a committee of 10 members, six of whom were non-Catholics. The recommendations will be considered by the Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales next week. The Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, himself came under fire last July for his own handling of a scandal involving a paedophile priest. Friar Michael Hill, who was released from prison last autumn, served three-and-a-half years of a five-year prison sentence imposed in 1997 for nine sex attacks, which included one on a boy with learning difficulties he met at Gatwick Airport chapel. The archbishop conceded he had made a mistake when it emerged that he was responsible for appointing Hill as chaplain to the airport even though concerns had been raised about his behaviour. The Archbishop of Cardiff, the Most Rev John Ward, has been replaced indefinitely by the Vatican amid accusations that he ignored warnings over a paedophile priest Joseph Jordan. Friar Jordan was convicted of child abuse last year and sentenced to eight years in jail. The review was ordered in September last year, after the Cardinal admitted that \"inadequate procedures\" had led to errors in the past. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor said today that the independent report was \"extremely constructive and helpful\".

      "body": "<p>Eight-year-old Andrew Thomas has not found it easy settling in at Dunmail Primary School in Bristol. He arrived at the beginning of the year and his aggressive behaviour, tendency to fight and the things he said so alienated his classmates that he now spends most playtimes alone. The others choose not to sit next to him in class and there is no child he can call his friend. Andrew's is an all too familiar story and schools around the country struggle to cope with unhappy and disruptive children. At Dunmail, staff became sufficiently concerned about Andrew\u00cds behaviour that they knew something had to be done. </p> <p>There are schools in which Andrew might have been punished and in due course excluded, but Dunmail is clear that this would be a failure for them and would only add to Andrew's own problems. Instead they decided to set up a 'circle of friends', a strikingly simple but carefully structured initiative that draws on classroom peers to take responsibility for the 'focus child's' problems and for helping him or her to change. </p> <p>On the day that Andrew's circle of friends is being set up he stands facing the children with class teacher Helen Sanday sitting beside him, her arm around his waist. She asks gently: 'You're finding it difficult to make friends aren't you?' As Andrew nods looking down, giving a crooked smile but seeming close to tears, Sanday explains that the other children understand this and so they have told her all the things they like about him. She reads these out: 'he is sometimes nice to me', 'he plays football with me', 'he does good drawings'.</p> <p>But, Sanday explains gently, there are also things that upset the children and these are the things that stop them wanting to be friends and Andrew listens as she recites: 'he fights', 'he doesn't share', 'sometimes he gets in moods'. Sanday then explains that the children want to help him settle in and a number have volunteered to be his special friends, staying with him in the classroom, in the playground, during activities. As she says it her class nods and smiles at Andrew and he, looking slightly dazed, sits down among them. </p> <p>Dunmail introduced circle of friends, supported by the Bristol Behavioural Educational Unit, three years ago, and since then they have organised circles for four children who were causing enough concern that exclusion was being considered. Sanday explains the organisation of this project, which originated in Canada and which is now used here in more than 100 local authority primary and secondary schools for children with emotional and social difficulties: </p> <p>'I begin by holding a meeting of the class but without the focus child. The children talk about the ways in which he or she annoys and upsets them. But then we think about how a person might be aggressive or show off because they feel lonely and sad and it always amazes me how much empathy and kindness children show once they think in this way. At the same time it\u00cds important for the focus child to hear the negatives as well as the positives and understand that they do need to change.'</p> <p>\u00f1I then ask for volunteers to be one of the child's special circle of friends and I usually get more children than I need. Each one chosen has a particular task, so a single child is not expected to be with the focus child all day long. The idea is that all through the day the child who has been isolated has 'friends' supporting him or her. There are weekly meetings with the circle of friends and the focus child to discuss how things are going.</p> <p>It surprises Sanday how quickly children quieten down and become more cooperative as well as better able to learn once the circle, which generally lasts in its formal structure for a term, is set up. And she has seen how the children who have been given a circle of friends have all made lasting friendships. As she says this James Phillips, 10, for whom the first circle at Dunmail was set up, strides into the room flanked by his two 'best friends', Matthew Bartley and Lee Harris, both nine, both of whom were volunteers originally. </p> <p>Sanday recollects: 'James was so troublesome we really didn't think we could keep him and his parents were very worried about how unhappy he was and how angry at home. But once the children started including him, he stopped driving them mad with his attention-seeking.' James agrees: 'I never wanted to come to school and my mum and dad got cross with me a lot. Now my friends come to the house to call for me and I\u00cdve always got someone to play with.' </p> <p>There have been similarly optimistic reports from many of the 100 local authority primary and secondary schools that, since 1998, have used the circle of friends approach. And the Gulbenkian Foundation, which provided funding for a pilot scheme in Bristol as part of its commitment to getting emotional education into schools, has just published an in-depth evaluation of how it has worked in four schools \u0084 The Positive Power of Friendship: An Illuminative Evaluation of the Circle of Friends Approach Within the Primary and Secondary School Phases. </p> <p>The author, Gill Taylor, strategic manager for Birmingham Social Inclusion, explains that the whole class is mobilised in a way that strengthens the bonds between them as a community. She adds: \u00f1The facilitator of the class discussion has a critical role in communicating respect and care for the focus child and for highlighting the fact that the problem situation is the whole class\u00cds problem and not just the focus child's.'</p> <p>For the evaluation Taylor and her co-author, Professor Bob Burden, head of the School of Education, Exeter interviewed the children selected, their parents and teachers, and their findings were analysed to see how far they reflected the main aims of circle of friends for the focus child, which include increased confidence and belief in the possibility of change, a sense of belonging, empowerment and improved problem-solving behaviour. Nine-year-old Sylvester is in year 4 at a London primary. He was constantly disrupting activities and class with his shouting and singing. When children told him to stop he was liable to become angry and spiteful. His mother's despair at her son's isolation crystallised in the fact he was never invited to birthday parties and no one had come to his. Sylvester was unhappy enough to respond positively when offered a circle of friends. After seven months he described how he was now 'sticking together' with the others and felt able to control his temper and walk away when he was annoyed. </p> <p>His teacher had watched how the class tried to calm Sylvester down and adopted the catchphrase 'it's not worth it'. They accepted him more and he would now help other children who were hurt. For Sylvester's mother, who noted that he was better behaved at home, the greatest delight was that three people had come to his birthday party and 'he was really happy'. </p> <p>Sheridan, 13, was already in secondary school when she was offered a circle of friends by teachers concerned about her inability to listen to what other children had to say, her determination to be the strongest and her inability to negotiate friendships. She was failing badly academically. And she was not enthusiastic about the group helping her at first, but after the third circle meeting her attitude began to show \u00f1a marked positive change\u00ee. </p> <p>The virtue of circle of friends, believes Taylor, who introduced it into Britain, is that it can be set up in any mainstream school without expensive resourcing, although she is adamant that proper training for the facilitating teacher is necessary. She is clear that circle of friends must be done with thought and care. For example, she says there is a risk, if all the attention is on the focus child and friends, that other children in the class will feel left out and they could then sabotage it. So some way of including them, too, is important. Also, she says, it is important that the emphasis is on letting the focus child see that they have a choice to change and that it is something they want to do rather than making it seem punitive or that they are so bad they will be rejected if they don\u00cdt change. \u00f1It takes skilful handling to ensure this process of negotiation,\u00ee Taylor explains. </p> <p>She hopes that the scheme will go on expanding, particularly in secondary schools where adolescents can be \u00f1more volatile in their emotions and more difficult to convince\u00ee. It is also essential that there is enough teacher time for it to be done properly. </p> <p>But whatever the difficulties and shortcomings teachers may encounter - and Sanday, realist to the last, talks of \u00f1pleasing improvements not miracle cures\u00ee \u0084 Taylor and Burden are adamant that: \u00f1In every case . . . the conclusion of the target child, their parents and their teachers was that something positive had happened as a result of establishing a circle of friends.\u00ee</p> <p>For more information about Circle of Friends, email: <a href=\"mailto:gill_taylor@ birmingham.gov.uk\"> gill_taylor@ birmingham.gov.uk</a> or telephone Circles Network on 0117 9393917.</p>",

As she says it her class nods and smiles at Andrew and he, looking slightly dazed, sits down among them. Dunmail introduced circle of friends, supported by the Bristol Behavioural Educational Unit, three years ago, and since then they have organised circles for four children who were causing enough concern that exclusion was being considered. Sanday explains the organisation of this project, which originated in Canada and which is now used here in more than 100 local authority primary and secondary schools for children with emotional and social difficulties: 'I begin by holding a meeting of the class but without the focus child. The children talk about the ways in which he or she annoys and upsets them. But then we think about how a person might be aggressive or show off because they feel lonely and sad and it always amazes me how much empathy and kindness children show once they think in this way. At the same time it\u00cds important for the focus child to hear the negatives as well as the positives and understand that they do need to change.' \u00f1I then ask for volunteers to be one of the child's special circle of friends and I usually get more children than I need. Each one chosen has a particular task, so a single child is not expected to be with the focus child all day long. The idea is that all through the day the child who has been isolated has 'friends' supporting him or her. There are weekly meetings with the circle of friends and the focus child to discuss how things are going. It surprises Sanday how quickly children quieten down and become more cooperative as well as better able to learn once the circle, which generally lasts in its formal structure for a term, is set up. And she has seen how the children who have been given a circle of friends have all made lasting friendships. As she says this James Phillips, 10, for whom the first circle at Dunmail was set up, strides into the room flanked by his two 'best friends', Matthew Bartley and Lee Harris, both nine, both of whom were volunteers originally. Sanday recollects: 'James was so troublesome we really didn't think we could keep him and his parents were very worried about how unhappy he was and how angry at home. But once the children started including him, he stopped driving them mad with his attention-seeking.' James agrees: 'I never wanted to come to school and my mum and dad got cross with me a lot. Now my friends come to the house to call for me and I\u00cdve always got someone to play with.' There have been similarly optimistic reports from many of the 100 local authority primary and secondary schools that, since 1998, have used the circle of friends approach. And the Gulbenkian Foundation, which provided funding for a pilot scheme in Bristol as part of its commitment to getting emotional education into schools, has just published an in-depth evaluation of how it has worked in four schools \u0084 The Positive Power of Friendship: An Illuminative Evaluation of the Circle of Friends Approach Within the Primary and Secondary School Phases. The author, Gill Taylor, strategic manager for Birmingham Social Inclusion, explains that the whole class is mobilised in a way that strengthens the bonds between them as a community. She adds: \u00f1The facilitator of the class discussion has a critical role in communicating respect and care for the focus child and for highlighting the fact that the problem situation is the whole class\u00cds problem and not just the focus child's.' For the evaluation Taylor and her co-author, Professor Bob Burden, head of the School of Education, Exeter interviewed the children selected, their parents and teachers, and their findings were analysed to see how far they reflected the main aims of circle of friends for the focus child, which include increased confidence and belief in the possibility of change, a sense of belonging, empowerment and improved problem-solving behaviour. Nine-year-old Sylvester is in year 4 at a London primary. He was constantly disrupting activities and class with his shouting and singing. When children told him to stop he was liable to become angry and spiteful. His mother's despair at her son's isolation crystallised in the fact he was never invited to birthday parties and no one had come to his. Sylvester was unhappy enough to respond positively when offered a circle of friends. After seven months he described how he was now 'sticking together' with the others and felt able to control his temper and walk away when he was annoyed. His teacher had watched how the class tried to calm Sylvester down and adopted the catchphrase 'it's not worth it'. They accepted him more and he would now help other children who were hurt. For Sylvester's mother, who noted that he was better behaved at home, the greatest delight was that three people had come to his birthday party and 'he was really happy'. Sheridan, 13, was already in secondary school when she was offered a circle of friends by teachers concerned about her inability to listen to what other children had to say, her determination to be the strongest and her inability to negotiate friendships. She was failing badly academically. And she was not enthusiastic about the group helping her at first, but after the third circle meeting her attitude began to show \u00f1a marked positive change\u00ee. The virtue of circle of friends, believes Taylor, who introduced it into Britain, is that it can be set up in any mainstream school without expensive resourcing, although she is adamant that proper training for the facilitating teacher is necessary. She is clear that circle of friends must be done with thought and care. For example, she says there is a risk, if all the attention is on the focus child and friends, that other children in the class will feel left out and they could then sabotage it. So some way of including them, too, is important. Also, she says, it is important that the emphasis is on letting the focus child see that they have a choice to change and that it is something they want to do rather than making it seem punitive or that they are so bad they will be rejected if they don\u00cdt change. \u00f1It takes skilful handling to ensure this process of negotiation,\u00ee Taylor explains. She hopes that the scheme will go on expanding, particularly in secondary schools where adolescents can be \u00f1more volatile in their emotions and more difficult to convince\u00ee. It is also essential that there is enough teacher time for it to be done properly. But whatever the difficulties and shortcomings teachers may encounter - and Sanday, realist to the last, talks of \u00f1pleasing improvements not miracle cures\u00ee \u0084 Taylor and Burden are adamant that: \u00f1In every case . . . the conclusion of the target child, their parents and their teachers was that something positive had happened as a result of establishing a circle of friends.\u00ee For more information about Circle of Friends, email: gill_taylor@ birmingham.gov.uk or telephone Circles Network on 0117 9393917.",

The service offers information, discounts and special offers on music and entertainment products sold in Tower Records. Consumers can sign up for the service by entering a competition to win a trip to New York which will be promoted by a print advertising campaign, via flyers, in-store and on www.towerrecords.co.uk. As part of the initiative, \"electronic vouchers\" are text-messaged to mobile phone users and redeemed by consumers showing the text message they have received to the shop assistant, like a virtual voucher. The aim of the text messaging service is to drive more music lovers to Tower Records and allows the retailer to communicate directly to consumers. Worldpop will receive prominent branding on all promotional material for the service. \"This is a massive opportunity to drive revenue for retailers, record companies and for Worldpop,\" said Dan Avener, the head of marketing at Worldpop. \"We have already shown the potential in this area with a stream of recognised brands and companies advertising through our SMS 'Music Alert' services. This deal brings the service into a high street arena providing fantastic opportunities for revenue generation.\" Useful link Tower Records",

Today there is further evidence that interest in God and religion is falling away with TV ratings showing that as few as 1m viewers bothered to tune in to vicariously celebrate what is the most important feast day of the Christian calendar. Easter Service on BBC1 and the Sunday Morning Show on ITV were watched by as few as 500,000 viewers apiece. More viewers - 600,000 - were paying homage to temples of the flesh over on Channel 5 where Charlie's Angels was providing an alternative morning's viewing. Even teenage soap Hollyoaks on Channel 4 fared better with 1.5m viewers. Just 900,000 tuned in to see the ailing Pope deliver his traditional Easter message from St Peter's Square in Rome in BBC1's Urbi et Orbi. Over on ITV, Melvyn Bragg - who is enjoying a new contract to cover the big religious issues as well as the arts - will have been disappointed to see that just 500,000 - 7% of the audience - bothered to watch the start of his new 10-part series, The Apostles. Religious TV on Good Friday didn't fare much better - although practising Christians may well have treated this day of abstinence as a TV-free zone. Just 800,000 viewers tuned in to see the Passion Play - Father Forgive: a meditation for Good Friday - on BBC at 11am. The animated portrayal of the life of Jesus, Miracle Maker, was the most popular religious programme of the weekend with 2.4m - almost a third of those watching TV at the time - switching on for the award-winning film starring the voices of Ralph Fiennes, William Hurt, Julie Christie and Richard E Grant.",

Diane Thompson, the chief executive of Camelot, will be joining the Advertising Standards Authority council alongside Dan O'Donoghue, head of strategic planning at advertising agency Publicis Worldwide. They are the first appointments made by the ASA's new chairman, Lord Borrie, since he took on the job in January. \"I am delighted to have secured the services of two people with such vast experience and knowledge,\" he said. \"They will play an important role in helping to ensure that UK non-broadcast advertising is legal, decent, honest and truthful,\" he added. The pair will replace Hugh Burkitt, the chairman of advertising agency Burkitt DDB, and Peter Mitchell, a director of Capital Radio, who leave after serving six years on the council. Just four members of the 12-strong council can be from the advertising industry. Ms Thompson became chief executive of Camelot in December 2000, having worked as commercial operations director since February 1997. She was credited with seeing off a challenge from Richard Branson to secure Camelot a second licence to run the National Lottery. Mr O'Donoghue has worked at Publicis for 17 years and was deputy chairman of the UK agency before moving over to Publicis Worldwide. Ms Thompson and Mr O'Donoghue will attend their first council meeting in June.",

Unfortunately, it has copped out of a recommendation that could improve the lives of poor people.</p> <p>To be fair, the committee is to be congratulated on producing its report so quickly. It started receiving evidence in February 2001 and the report was published on April 4. That's lightning by parliamentary standards.</p> <p>But it is to be condemned for not following the logic of its own analysis, which implied that social fund loans should be replaced by grants. It wimped out.</p> <p>Prior to 1988, claimants depending upon welfare benefits long term were entitled to grants for essential domestic items such as fires and cookers. In a cost-cutting exercise, the then Conservative government devised the social fund. The fund retained some grants, called community care grants, for people leaving institutions or to prevent them having to enter institutions.</p> <p>Other grants, however, were replaced by loans. Budgeting loans were for \"irregular needs\" - such as when a family's cooker blows up - while crisis loans were for emergencies. The loans were repaid by automatic deductions from weekly incomes. They were interest free and could take up to a quarter of the debtor's weekly income.</p> <p>In opposition, the Labour party vehemently condemned the changes. But once in power it retained them. It is to the social security committee's credit that it decided to investigate the workings of the social fund, and its report provides a thorough and critical analysis.</p> <p>The report points out that despite constant demand, the number of community care grants has dropped from 294,000 in 1993-94 to 219,000 in 1999-2000. Four in 10 applications for budgeting loans and nearly three in 10 (27%) for crisis loans were rejected. The applicants might well be eligible and in desperate need but under the social fund system each district has a fixed and inadequate budget. So when that budget runs out, no more is available.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, some applicants for loans have been refused because they were considered too poor to make repayments. In other words, the very poorest were denied help. Those receiving loans could purchase one essential item but, the committee found, the weekly repayments left them in absolute poverty.</p> <p>Both those refused loans and those repaying them then often turned to commercial lenders who charge interest rates of up to 150%.</p> <p>The committee summed up: \"The present social fund system is working against the government's key aim of reducing child poverty [It] is adding to the poverty and social exclusion of families with children by, in many cases, denying them access to basic necessities and increasing their indebtedness. This is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>The report contains 218 pages of evidence from witnesses, nearly all of whom call for loans to be abolished and grants put in their place. The exception was Angela Eagle, a minister from the Department of Social Security. In words which Mrs Thatcher would no doubt applaud, she opposed grants because they were \"wide open to abuse and led to expenditure spiralling out of control\".</p> <p>So given the evidence and the trend of the committee's analysis, it was to be expected that it would recommend the abolition of loans. Indeed, after a lone mother told them: \"They must give you grants for they are essential,\" the committee added: \"We agree.\"</p> <p>However, despite making useful proposals to increase district budgets, to introduce an impartial review system for complaints, and to humanise the administration, it does not call for loans to go and grants to return</p> <p>It lamely ends: \"The level of repayments and the repayment period should be much more flexible in order to minimise the hardship which claimants experience.\" In short, the core of the present system should continue.</p> <p>What explains this cop out? It can't be cost. In his evidence to the committee, Professor Gary Craig estimated that a scheme based primarily on grants would cost about \u00a3800m - the government throws that amount at farmers without a thought.</p> <p>The committee states that the government is unlikely to accept a wholesale change to grants and implies that such a radical recommendation, therefore, is not worthwhile. Perhaps the predominant Labour membership of the committee did not want to put pressure on New Labour before the next general election. Whatever the explanation, the committee has failed the poor.</p> <p>Last week a lone mother told me how her daughter had spilt a drink on, and ruined, her only fire. She has already had an application to the social fund refused. Does the committee advise her to get money from a loan shark or just to stay cold?</p> <p>As a voluntary neighbourhood worker in the Easterhouse estate, Glasgow, I have seen 50 families in financial distress over the last two years. So what is my way forward? I propose that every long-term claimant be given a \u00a3500 annual bonus.</p> <p>It would be up to them to decide whether to use it to buy furniture, Christmas presents or a holiday. The community care grants would have to remain, as often the costs of people taking up residence in the neighbourhood after years in an institution are more than \u00a3500. </p> <p>But the loans would be abolished and, with them, their expensive administration. People on low incomes would have \u00a3500 as an entitlement and so be spared the humiliating experience of trying to convince officials that they need a loan.</p> <p>But even this would not deal with poverty. It is significant that the select committee wants the government to \"fund research into the levels of income needed to avoid poverty\". The committee acknowledges that the social fund exists because people just do not have enough money.</p> <p>Until New Labour is prepared to say just how much weekly income is required for a decent lifestyle and to ensure that all citizens have that level, then poverty will continue.</p> <p>\u0095 Bob Holman is the author of the pamphlet, George Lansbury: Labour's Neglected Leader, Christian Socialist Movement.</p>",

The report points out that despite constant demand, the number of community care grants has dropped from 294,000 in 1993-94 to 219,000 in 1999-2000. Four in 10 applications for budgeting loans and nearly three in 10 (27%) for crisis loans were rejected. The applicants might well be eligible and in desperate need but under the social fund system each district has a fixed and inadequate budget. So when that budget runs out, no more is available. Extraordinarily, some applicants for loans have been refused because they were considered too poor to make repayments. In other words, the very poorest were denied help. Those receiving loans could purchase one essential item but, the committee found, the weekly repayments left them in absolute poverty. Both those refused loans and those repaying them then often turned to commercial lenders who charge interest rates of up to 150%. The committee summed up: \"The present social fund system is working against the government's key aim of reducing child poverty [It] is adding to the poverty and social exclusion of families with children by, in many cases, denying them access to basic necessities and increasing their indebtedness. This is unacceptable.\" The report contains 218 pages of evidence from witnesses, nearly all of whom call for loans to be abolished and grants put in their place. The exception was Angela Eagle, a minister from the Department of Social Security. In words which Mrs Thatcher would no doubt applaud, she opposed grants because they were \"wide open to abuse and led to expenditure spiralling out of control\". So given the evidence and the trend of the committee's analysis, it was to be expected that it would recommend the abolition of loans. Indeed, after a lone mother told them: \"They must give you grants for they are essential,\" the committee added: \"We agree.\" However, despite making useful proposals to increase district budgets, to introduce an impartial review system for complaints, and to humanise the administration, it does not call for loans to go and grants to return It lamely ends: \"The level of repayments and the repayment period should be much more flexible in order to minimise the hardship which claimants experience.\" In short, the core of the present system should continue. What explains this cop out? It can't be cost. In his evidence to the committee, Professor Gary Craig estimated that a scheme based primarily on grants would cost about \u00a3800m - the government throws that amount at farmers without a thought. The committee states that the government is unlikely to accept a wholesale change to grants and implies that such a radical recommendation, therefore, is not worthwhile. Perhaps the predominant Labour membership of the committee did not want to put pressure on New Labour before the next general election. Whatever the explanation, the committee has failed the poor. Last week a lone mother told me how her daughter had spilt a drink on, and ruined, her only fire. She has already had an application to the social fund refused. Does the committee advise her to get money from a loan shark or just to stay cold? As a voluntary neighbourhood worker in the Easterhouse estate, Glasgow, I have seen 50 families in financial distress over the last two years. So what is my way forward? I propose that every long-term claimant be given a \u00a3500 annual bonus. It would be up to them to decide whether to use it to buy furniture, Christmas presents or a holiday. The community care grants would have to remain, as often the costs of people taking up residence in the neighbourhood after years in an institution are more than \u00a3500. But the loans would be abolished and, with them, their expensive administration. People on low incomes would have \u00a3500 as an entitlement and so be spared the humiliating experience of trying to convince officials that they need a loan. But even this would not deal with poverty. It is significant that the select committee wants the government to \"fund research into the levels of income needed to avoid poverty\". The committee acknowledges that the social fund exists because people just do not have enough money. Until New Labour is prepared to say just how much weekly income is required for a decent lifestyle and to ensure that all citizens have that level, then poverty will continue. \u0095 Bob Holman is the author of the pamphlet, George Lansbury: Labour's Neglected Leader, Christian Socialist Movement.",

As the internet loses its gloss, pundits are predicting the next big development will be interactive TV. However, a report out today claims there is a distinct lack of clarity among marketeers about how iTV fits into future campaigns. Of 300 marketeers canvassed by researchers at BMPtvi, an overwhelming 85% said they didn't know what implications iTV had for marketing. Confusion reigns over cost, consumer penetration, lack of results and effectiveness, with 60% of those questioned unable to comment on the costs of iTV. Additionally, 71% of participants believed there was a low level of consumer awareness of iTV, despite a 30% household penetration of the medium. This is projected to rise to 40% by the end of this year. Andrew Howells, the managing director of iTV advertising agency BMPtvi, called for more clarity. \"It's important that the iTV platforms provide more information about their interactive services,\" he said. \"Marketers need more detail on viewers interacting as well as specific case study results.

      "body": "<p>Confusion is growing over the fate of up to 250 child slaves after officials in the west African nation of Benin initially found only seven children on board the ship that they had suspected was carrying them.</p> <p>The Nigerian-registered ship, MV Etireno, docked in Benin's capital, Cotonou, early this morning, and port authorities found it to be carrying mostly adults. Officials are continuing to search the ship for the missing children.</p> <p>The failure to find the children on board has fuelled fears that the children may have been offloaded at a remote port in Nigeria or even thrown overboard to allow the ship's crew to escape prosecution.</p> <p>The Etireno has been at sea since March 30, when it set sail from Cotonou headed for Gabon, where it was refused permission to dock. It is believed that the ship's crew intended to deliver the children into slavery in Gabon.

      "bodyText": "Confusion is growing over the fate of up to 250 child slaves after officials in the west African nation of Benin initially found only seven children on board the ship that they had suspected was carrying them. The Nigerian-registered ship, MV Etireno, docked in Benin's capital, Cotonou, early this morning, and port authorities found it to be carrying mostly adults. Officials are continuing to search the ship for the missing children. The failure to find the children on board has fuelled fears that the children may have been offloaded at a remote port in Nigeria or even thrown overboard to allow the ship's crew to escape prosecution. The Etireno has been at sea since March 30, when it set sail from Cotonou headed for Gabon, where it was refused permission to dock. It is believed that the ship's crew intended to deliver the children into slavery in Gabon. Officials from Benin and the UN said that port authorities in both Gabon and Cameroon had reported turning away a ship with anything from 100-250 child slaves aboard. UN officials in Cotonou earlier speculated that the Etireno's captain, a Nigerian man with a criminal past, could have thrown his human cargo overboard. After the ship's arrival, the same officials said that the truth would probably not be known until the government finished an investigation, including interviews with the passengers on board. However, a government minister in Benin said that there has been a mix-up, and another unidentified vessel is the slave ship. The social protection minister, Ramatou Baba Moussa, said the Etireno, which UN and local officials originally thought had left Benin with the children, may have been confused with a second ship, whose name and current location remain a mystery. She said that it was not known whether or not any unaccompanied children were on board the Etireno. \"I don't know what to think,\" said Nicolas Pron, a senior official with the UN children's fund in Benin. \"My main concern is that the kids are here and safe, and we will hear if that is the case.\" The Etireno, a white, 200-foot-long ferry, pulled into Cotonou port shortly after 1am local time (12am GMT), as Cabinet ministers, police, soldiers, journalists and UN employees crowded the dockside. Dozens of women, a few men and a handful of children could be seen through the ship's passenger cabin windows, from which laundry was hanging inside, as the boat's Nigerian crew barked orders in English. Journalists who boarded the ship found nervous and exhausted passengers who said that no child slaves had been on the ship. Some appeared frightened. The vessel's 40-year-old Nigerian captain, Lawrence Onome, echoed their denials. \"I have not committed any offense that will warrant my arrest,\" Mr Onome said. \"I am not into child slavery, they can't prove it. It is one thing to say and one thing to prove.\" Related articles 17.04.2001: Fears grow for children as slave ship docks 16.04.2001: Aboard the slave ship of despair 14.04.2001: 250 'child slaves' to sail back to Benin 16.04.2001: Aminata's tale of tears and cruelty Useful links Unicef UN report on slave trafficking between Benin and Gabon The Guardian (Nigeria)",

We know this because Riv's team-mate Pep Guardiola's agent (keeping up?) said on Spanish telly: \"Do you think Rivaldo is staying at Barcelona? I'm saying that because next Thursday there will be a meeting at which a very important English club is going to propose the signing of Rivaldo to representatives of Barcelona.\" But there's a stumbling block: the Brazilian will cost at least \u00a322m and \u00a3100,000 a week. Oh, and Rivaldo himself says he wants to stay with Barca. \"I know nothing about meetings between clubs and I don't want to know anything about them,\" he said. \"If it is down to me I will honour my contract but it all depends on the fans, the president and directors.\" Manchester United have joined Leeds in the chase for Newcastle's Kieron Dyer. But they'll have to beat David O'Leary's bid of \u00a311m, which Bobby Robson feels is derisory. Espanyol's Romanian midfielder, Constantin Galca, is being tracked by Rangers and Tottenham. And according to Planet Football, the 29-year-old will decide on his future this week: \"It is nice to know Dick Advocaat was here to watch me but I've not given him my decision.

      "bodyText": "BBC1 has failed to turn around its ratings decline in the first six months of the new Ten O'Clock News schedule. Its audience share has fallen beneath the pyschologically important 30% barrier. It means significantly fewer than one in three viewers have been switching on to BBC1 in peaktime since the new-look schedule was introduced. On occasions, the number tuning in has dropped as low as 3m. Overall, the channel has averaged a 28.6% share in peaktime between 6pm and 10.30pm since its late news bulletin moved to 10pm. In the same six-month period in 1999-2000, BBC1 had 30.2% of peaktime viewing. Senior executives admit part of the BBC's problem is that it did not have the drama or entertainment hits stockpiled when the channel went head first into the ratings war with ITV. This, at least, is what one executive admitted when asked about the poor performance on March 29, when Channel 5 achieved record ratings for its coverage of the England v Albania World Cup qualifier. It was a crucial night for the nation's football lovers - but not for the nation. ITV managed to hold its own by scheduling a documentary on the Sound of Music. The BBC had a reduced audience of 3m and a 13% audience share during Celebrity Ready Steady Cook, which featured guests Greg Rusedski and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson. BBC insiders accept the new schedule was launched without the necessary programming in place to give ITV a serious run for its money. In tts first week, the corporation pulled out all its best programmes. This did wonders for the ratings - the new and final series of One Foot in the Grave, the Royle Family and the Men -n Black movie premiere got the new-look BBC1 got off to a good start. But the lack of suitable ratings-grabbers soon became apparent. So shows such as Pete Postlethwaite's drama, the Sins, and David Attenborough's natural history documentary State of the Planet, which were never conceived as big audience pullers, were thrown into the mix and pulverised. One of few positive signs the BBC1 controller can point to is the ratings have been boosted between 9pm and 10pm. \"This is good news,\" said a BBC spokeswoman. \"It indicates we have stabilised and even increased audiences in that important slot against the background of rising multichannel viewing.\" Also, after a particularly grim time in January, there have been signs of a BBC1 fightback over the past couple of months. In the six weeks to April 8, the channel has recorded a 29% peaktime audience share after slumping to just over 27% in January. Contributing factors have included the 'who shot Phil Mitchell?' storyline in EastEnders, the foot and mouth crisis boosting news audiences and Liverpool's run in the Uefa Cup, which was covered live in Thursday night Match of the Day specials. BBC1 has also enjoyed some success with its Monday and Tuesday night drama slots, which have been branded Crime Doubles in a dedicated marketing campaign. The Clive Owen vehicle Second Sight was the only show to misfire badly. Looking to the future, Lorraine Heggessey has made long-running crime dramas a priority. No less than 14 new dramas, mostly with a crime theme, will be launched this spring and summer in an attempt to find future ratings bankers that can return next year. BBC1 still has big problems on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday nights. The fourth daily instalment of EastEnders - expected to get under way sometime in the spring or summer - will plug a hole on one of those evenings. Wednesdays seem to be the most needy case. However, fixing the BBC1 schedule will take longer than six months. \"We have always said consolidating the new schedule would be a long game,\" the BBC spokeswoman confirmed.",

      "body": "<p>One look at the TopShop gear and the necklace spelling out \"Foxy\" and you somehow knew, when Judith Kilshaw arrived at the high court last week, that she was not going to be allowed to take those twins home. The babies she and husband Alan had found on the internet and paid \u00a38,200 to adopt would be on their way back to Missouri, their home state, to face a new legal battle between their estranged biological parents over their future. </p> <p>The nation watched in fascinated horror as the saga unfolded. First the tiny babies were grabbed back from their first would-be adopters in California after the Kilshaws offered more money, then they were driven across America to be adopted in Arkansas, where the residency requirements, lax though they were, were flouted by the babies' mother. Doubts grew about the couple's suitability as replacement parents. </p> <p>The Kilshaws' venture into free-market baby acquisition has left them bruised by the media they courted, and tens of thousands of pounds poorer. But the tale, unedifying as it is, will leave one enduring legacy. As the twins head for their fifth short-term home in nine months of life and the battle ground over their custody shifts to a courtroom in St Louis, laws to protect future Belindas and Kimberleys are being rushed into force in Britain. </p> <p>The Kilshaws' QC, Allan Levy, maintains a discreet professional silence on his controversial clients and the merits of their case. Barristers are obliged by the cab-rank rule to pick up any litigant who happens to flag them down. But Levy - a leading child law specialist whose CV includes the Cleveland abuse inquiry in the 1980s, the Pindown children's home scandal in the early 1990s and the recent case of the Siamese twins Jodie and Mary - welcomes moves to tighten the lax controls on adoption from abroad as a vital protection for vulnerable children. </p> <p>\"The problem has been that intercountry adoption has not been properly regulated in any way,\" he says. \"At worst, it's been a bit like the Wild West, where anything went. Although there have been lots of successful intercountry adoptions, I've been involved in cases in the past where there were thoroughly unsatisfactory goings-on in certain central and south American countries and indeed one lawyer who specialised in adoption in a South American country was jailed. </p> <p>\"In certain countries where there had been civil wars, when the British embassy, perhaps at the instigation of the Official Solicitor, was investigating the source of the child, trying to track down the natural parents, they were finding addresses in war zones that were probably non-existent and certainly couldn't be reached. There was a very real likelihood that a serious racket was going on where the children were being sold or, even worse, kidnapped, or the parents were being subjected to some sort of duress or extortion.\" </p> <p>Couples brought in children without the knowledge or approval of social services and immigration officers turned a blind eye. Once the child was settled and had bonded with the new parents, the courts came under huge pressure to approve the adop tion. Had the Kilshaws kept their heads down and avoided the media, the outcome of their case might have been quite different. </p> <p>There has been only one other recent case where a child brought to the UK for adoption was sent back: last year an adoption agency in Texas got back a seven-month-old baby already removed from the prospective adopters by social services, who had deemed them unsuitable to adopt before they went to America. Had the baby been with the couple for a year, said the judge, the decision would have been much more difficult. </p> <p>\"By the time the procedures were gone through, often a year, 18 months, or two years had gone by and it was almost impossible for the court to move the child, so it was a fait accompli,\" says Levy. \"The welfare of the child demanded that the adoption order be made, even though the whole process may have been very dubious.\" </p> <p>From April 30, anyone who brings in a child from abroad without prior approval by an adoption agency and the agreement of the Department of Health will commit a criminal offence, punishable by up to three months in prison, a fine of up to \u00a35,000, or both. The new law will spell the end of immigration officers' practice of simply waving through babies who arrive in their new parents' arms without the proper entry clearance. </p> <p>The reform was planned before the internet twins hit the headlines but their story was the catalyst for rushing it into law. Ironically, though, it would probably not have stopped the Kilshaws because they had an apparently valid adoption order from the US. American adoption orders are recognised in the UK, along with those of the older Commonwealth countries and many European states. But comparatively few US children are brought into Britain for adoption; more than half now come from China, with India the next biggest source. </p> <p>A further measure will be needed to make sure that all adoptions from abroad measure up to the stringent standards that apply to home adoptions. The UK is finally on course to ratify the Hague convention on intercountry adoption next year. </p> <p>Under the convention, couples wanting to adopt a child will have to apply to a central authority here, who will send a report on the would- be parents' suitability to the corresponding authority in the child's country. The adoption will go ahead there only if the natural parents have consented, the central authorities in both countries agree, and the child has been cleared by the Home Office to settle in the UK. </p> <p>Levy, who has appeared in many adoption cases and written a book on the subject, points out that couples have felt compelled to look abroad not just because of the shortage of young babies to adopt in this country but because social services departments have been so restrictive in their adoption policies. \"One of the reasons people were driven to go abroad to countries like China, Ecuador, El Salvador and the USA is that they found social services were not approving them as adopters because they were too old at 35 or 40. Or they were thought to be too middle class or the wrong ethnic origin, or they smoked too much or were overweight. I'm amazed there hasn't been a case that has challenged social services departments on the basis that they were fettering their discretion by taking such narrow views of people who were probably admirable adopters.\" </p> <p>The government agrees that many local councils applied too restrictive a policy in the past, allowing too many children to languish in care. The tiny number of babies given up for adoption at birth means that most of the children adopted in the UK come from care, and the government wants more of them to be found permanent homes more quickly. The adoption and children bill, now going through parliament, was originally pencilled in for the government's second term; its fast-tracking is another legacy of the internet twins drama. </p> <p>\"It's horrific how many placements in care some children have,\" says Levy. \"But adoption in this country in the main means older children, and children who have had a bad start in life and who've got physical or psychological problems. The startling statistic is that one adoption in five of children in care breaks down, and for children aged nine or over the failure rate, amazingly, is 40%. So it's not a primrose path by any means. But I think the government is right to try to speed up and centralise the process because it's far too late. There also needs to be much more post-adoption support for families, and much more galvanising into action of particular councils. The disparities between the numbers of adoptions in different authorities and between the length of time different authorities take to find permanent homes for children is disturbing.\" </p> <p>But while he welcomes most of the bill, he takes issue with one of its reforms, which he thinks may breach human rights laws. One clause replaces the current provision under which a court may override a natural parent's refusal to consent to adoption, if the parent is deemed to be \"unreasonably\" withholding agreement. That provision requires the court to weigh up what a reasonable parent would do in the circumstances, and provides some safeguard for the biological parent. The new clause would simply allow the court to override the parent's refusal if the child's welfare warranted it. </p> <p>\"I think there's a real danger of social engineering,\" says Levy. \"It's not a sufficient safeguard to protect the natural parent. At first blush, what's wrong with the welfare of the child being paramount? But I think there's a great temptation for the court to say 'Well, I think that child would have a better future with the adoptive parents' - and that is pure social engineering - rather than having to say that there is no way this child's welfare can be properly protected by the natural parent and so the court is compelled to make an adoption order. </p> <p>\"I anticipate that this will be an area which will be subject to considerable discussion and opposition. I feel very uneasy about it. I think lawyers and others will make their views very firmly known to parliament - at least I hope they do.\"</p>",

The Kilshaws' venture into free-market baby acquisition has left them bruised by the media they courted, and tens of thousands of pounds poorer. But the tale, unedifying as it is, will leave one enduring legacy. As the twins head for their fifth short-term home in nine months of life and the battle ground over their custody shifts to a courtroom in St Louis, laws to protect future Belindas and Kimberleys are being rushed into force in Britain. The Kilshaws' QC, Allan Levy, maintains a discreet professional silence on his controversial clients and the merits of their case. Barristers are obliged by the cab-rank rule to pick up any litigant who happens to flag them down. But Levy - a leading child law specialist whose CV includes the Cleveland abuse inquiry in the 1980s, the Pindown children's home scandal in the early 1990s and the recent case of the Siamese twins Jodie and Mary - welcomes moves to tighten the lax controls on adoption from abroad as a vital protection for vulnerable children. \"The problem has been that intercountry adoption has not been properly regulated in any way,\" he says. \"At worst, it's been a bit like the Wild West, where anything went. Although there have been lots of successful intercountry adoptions, I've been involved in cases in the past where there were thoroughly unsatisfactory goings-on in certain central and south American countries and indeed one lawyer who specialised in adoption in a South American country was jailed. \"In certain countries where there had been civil wars, when the British embassy, perhaps at the instigation of the Official Solicitor, was investigating the source of the child, trying to track down the natural parents, they were finding addresses in war zones that were probably non-existent and certainly couldn't be reached. There was a very real likelihood that a serious racket was going on where the children were being sold or, even worse, kidnapped, or the parents were being subjected to some sort of duress or extortion.\" Couples brought in children without the knowledge or approval of social services and immigration officers turned a blind eye. Once the child was settled and had bonded with the new parents, the courts came under huge pressure to approve the adop tion. Had the Kilshaws kept their heads down and avoided the media, the outcome of their case might have been quite different. There has been only one other recent case where a child brought to the UK for adoption was sent back: last year an adoption agency in Texas got back a seven-month-old baby already removed from the prospective adopters by social services, who had deemed them unsuitable to adopt before they went to America. Had the baby been with the couple for a year, said the judge, the decision would have been much more difficult. \"By the time the procedures were gone through, often a year, 18 months, or two years had gone by and it was almost impossible for the court to move the child, so it was a fait accompli,\" says Levy. \"The welfare of the child demanded that the adoption order be made, even though the whole process may have been very dubious.\" From April 30, anyone who brings in a child from abroad without prior approval by an adoption agency and the agreement of the Department of Health will commit a criminal offence, punishable by up to three months in prison, a fine of up to \u00a35,000, or both. The new law will spell the end of immigration officers' practice of simply waving through babies who arrive in their new parents' arms without the proper entry clearance. The reform was planned before the internet twins hit the headlines but their story was the catalyst for rushing it into law. Ironically, though, it would probably not have stopped the Kilshaws because they had an apparently valid adoption order from the US. American adoption orders are recognised in the UK, along with those of the older Commonwealth countries and many European states. But comparatively few US children are brought into Britain for adoption; more than half now come from China, with India the next biggest source. A further measure will be needed to make sure that all adoptions from abroad measure up to the stringent standards that apply to home adoptions. The UK is finally on course to ratify the Hague convention on intercountry adoption next year. Under the convention, couples wanting to adopt a child will have to apply to a central authority here, who will send a report on the would- be parents' suitability to the corresponding authority in the child's country. The adoption will go ahead there only if the natural parents have consented, the central authorities in both countries agree, and the child has been cleared by the Home Office to settle in the UK. Levy, who has appeared in many adoption cases and written a book on the subject, points out that couples have felt compelled to look abroad not just because of the shortage of young babies to adopt in this country but because social services departments have been so restrictive in their adoption policies. \"One of the reasons people were driven to go abroad to countries like China, Ecuador, El Salvador and the USA is that they found social services were not approving them as adopters because they were too old at 35 or 40. Or they were thought to be too middle class or the wrong ethnic origin, or they smoked too much or were overweight. I'm amazed there hasn't been a case that has challenged social services departments on the basis that they were fettering their discretion by taking such narrow views of people who were probably admirable adopters.\" The government agrees that many local councils applied too restrictive a policy in the past, allowing too many children to languish in care. The tiny number of babies given up for adoption at birth means that most of the children adopted in the UK come from care, and the government wants more of them to be found permanent homes more quickly. The adoption and children bill, now going through parliament, was originally pencilled in for the government's second term; its fast-tracking is another legacy of the internet twins drama. \"It's horrific how many placements in care some children have,\" says Levy. \"But adoption in this country in the main means older children, and children who have had a bad start in life and who've got physical or psychological problems. The startling statistic is that one adoption in five of children in care breaks down, and for children aged nine or over the failure rate, amazingly, is 40%. So it's not a primrose path by any means. But I think the government is right to try to speed up and centralise the process because it's far too late. There also needs to be much more post-adoption support for families, and much more galvanising into action of particular councils. The disparities between the numbers of adoptions in different authorities and between the length of time different authorities take to find permanent homes for children is disturbing.\" But while he welcomes most of the bill, he takes issue with one of its reforms, which he thinks may breach human rights laws. One clause replaces the current provision under which a court may override a natural parent's refusal to consent to adoption, if the parent is deemed to be \"unreasonably\" withholding agreement. That provision requires the court to weigh up what a reasonable parent would do in the circumstances, and provides some safeguard for the biological parent. The new clause would simply allow the court to override the parent's refusal if the child's welfare warranted it. \"I think there's a real danger of social engineering,\" says Levy. \"It's not a sufficient safeguard to protect the natural parent. At first blush, what's wrong with the welfare of the child being paramount? But I think there's a great temptation for the court to say 'Well, I think that child would have a better future with the adoptive parents' - and that is pure social engineering - rather than having to say that there is no way this child's welfare can be properly protected by the natural parent and so the court is compelled to make an adoption order. \"I anticipate that this will be an area which will be subject to considerable discussion and opposition. I feel very uneasy about it. I think lawyers and others will make their views very firmly known to parliament - at least I hope they do.\"",

Then the photographer had to change the film and we were left in mid-pose. \"The pause seemed like an eternity. I thought 'Say something, anything.' Unfortunately the only thing I could think of was 'Nice speech' and then there was complete silence for nearly two minutes. \"We ended up holding hands for nearly two minutes. He acknowledged my 'Nice speech' and remained really professional in the handshaking pose but the time seemed to be an eternity.\" Mr Green has been compiling the thoughts of people, including some celebrities, on what they would have said on a website. Suggestions for topics range from the ridiculous - for example had he changed the toilet seats at No 10 so he would not be sitting on the same piece of plastic or wood as Margaret Thatcher - to the very serious, including Ireland, devolution and the plight of pensioners. The suggestions are to be gathered in a book called A Minute With. Anyone who wants to offer a contribution to the book should look at the website www.aminutewith.com \u0095 Breaking news about the PR sector at MediaGuardian.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Former Channel 5 boss David Elstein is spearheading an initiative to slash the cost of digital TV access for viewers. Mr Elstein is chairman of Xios Transcast Corporation, which plans to cut the cost of the set-top boxes that decode digital TV signals. \"This technology could solve the problem of how to produce cheap set-top boxes. It could be on the way to creating a worldwide standard as ubiquitous as Microsoft's Windows,\" he said. The government plans to switch off the analogue TV signal over the next five years, but millions of homes will have to be kitted out with set-top boxes in order to meet the deadline. Mr Elstein believes a new product from XTC provides a cheap solution to the problem, and is looking for \u00a36m from investors to see the company through the next two years. \"It is quite possible to imagine \u00a31bn of sales in several years,\" he said. XTC has found a niche in the market thanks to the prohibitive cost of computer memory, which is keeping the price of current set-top boxes high. The new box reduces the amount of memory needed by streaming information from a satellite rather than storing it in a box and filtering it into a television. The company plans to license the technology rather than manufacture it itself. Mr Elstein has been a busy man since he resigned as chief executive of Channel 5 in October last year. He works as a media consultant at Arthur D Little and recently joined the board of film and TV production group Civilain Content. He has also received offers to be chairman of other companies.

Vaccination has been highly effective against the human smallpox and polio viruses but its effectiveness against foot and mouth is not so clear cut.</p> <p>First, foot and mouth presents itself as a multiplicity of strains and vaccination against one strain gives variable protection against others. Further, the virus has the unfortunate knack of mutation, so vaccines that give good protection on one occasion may be less effective subsequently. Efforts to mitigate this situation take the form of the production of multivalent vaccines - that is, vaccines containing several of the strains deemed of likely occurrence in any given area. Although this produces a wider umbrella of protection, even the best vaccines are less than perfect.</p> <p>The shortcomings of the vaccines is only part of the problem. The protective antibodies in cattle subside relatively quickly, sometimes rendering animals susceptible to reinfection in as little as six or seven months. Biannual vaccination would be expensive and inconvenient, requiring a cumbersome administrative structure and inspection to ensure that the programme was being universally applied. The biggest problem from a commercial view, however, is that vaccinated animals may harbour the virus without showing signs of ill health, effectively putting paid to Britain's meat products export trade for an unforeseeable period.</p> <p>The kneejerk demand for vaccination ignores the fact that the slaughter policy has kept Britain free from substantial losses due to foot and mouth since 1967. The only outbreak in those 34 years occurred in the 1980s when this now reviled policy resulted in rapid containment and eradication of the disease.</p> <p>Any decision about whether to vaccinate is difficult because there are so many unknown factors, the chief of these being the frequency and costliness of outbreaks. It is worth noting that the incidence of the disease worldwide (and hence the possible sources of infection) has increased in recent years.

This is because a switch to vaccination at this stage might well produce the worst of all worlds. Taiwan did just that recently, with the result that after the expense of slaughter and disposal of thousands of pigs they must endure the expense and inconvenience of vaccinating all remaining stock once or twice a year. Further, the virus probably still lurks among the vaccinated animals, and all exports are banned. International regulations dictate that no animal exports are permitted for three years after the last vaccinated animal has been destroyed. If infection is detected after vaccination has commenced, the delay in resuming exports would be set back even further.</p> <p>Limited vaccination in the form of the inoculation of livestock in a barrier area surrounding infected areas is also under consideration.

The saliva of afflicted animals is heavily loaded with the virus, so that the surrounding atmosphere becomes contaminated both by drooling and by exhalation.

      "bodyText": "With half of Britain's livestock threatened with destruction farmers and the public are demanding to know why vaccination is not being used to stop the slaughter. Vaccination has been highly effective against the human smallpox and polio viruses but its effectiveness against foot and mouth is not so clear cut. First, foot and mouth presents itself as a multiplicity of strains and vaccination against one strain gives variable protection against others. Further, the virus has the unfortunate knack of mutation, so vaccines that give good protection on one occasion may be less effective subsequently. Efforts to mitigate this situation take the form of the production of multivalent vaccines - that is, vaccines containing several of the strains deemed of likely occurrence in any given area. Although this produces a wider umbrella of protection, even the best vaccines are less than perfect. The shortcomings of the vaccines is only part of the problem. The protective antibodies in cattle subside relatively quickly, sometimes rendering animals susceptible to reinfection in as little as six or seven months. Biannual vaccination would be expensive and inconvenient, requiring a cumbersome administrative structure and inspection to ensure that the programme was being universally applied. The biggest problem from a commercial view, however, is that vaccinated animals may harbour the virus without showing signs of ill health, effectively putting paid to Britain's meat products export trade for an unforeseeable period. The kneejerk demand for vaccination ignores the fact that the slaughter policy has kept Britain free from substantial losses due to foot and mouth since 1967. The only outbreak in those 34 years occurred in the 1980s when this now reviled policy resulted in rapid containment and eradication of the disease. Any decision about whether to vaccinate is difficult because there are so many unknown factors, the chief of these being the frequency and costliness of outbreaks. It is worth noting that the incidence of the disease worldwide (and hence the possible sources of infection) has increased in recent years. However, Britain's position as an island remote from any endemic infected lands means, in theory at least, that the exclu sion of infected materials should be straightforward. On the other hand, increasing international trade presents the hazard of importing infected material either inadvertently or by means of smuggled goods. Contingency plans for vaccination do exist and are under continuous consideration, though they would probably be used only as a last resort. This is because a switch to vaccination at this stage might well produce the worst of all worlds.

But the adverts will stay up because politicians have exempted themselves from the rules governing advertising. The Advertising Standards Authority said it had received several complaints about the adverts but was powerless to act on them. And industry experts say that the film-style posters, which show the grinning faces of Mr Hague and Mr Portillo above the words \"Economic Disaster II\", are in direct contravention of advertising rules on privacy. The watchdog's rules state that advertisers should not portray people in a negative way without their permission. It was this rule that led to the banning of the Conservatives' infamous \"demon eyes\" posters during the 1997 election potraying Tony Blair as the devil. \"We have received complaints and have sent back letters saying it's not within our remit any more,\" said an ASA spokesman. \"We upheld complaints about 'demon eyes' on the grounds that Mr Blair had been portrayed in a negative way without his permission.

Then again, the career opening excites me.</p> <p>A few years ago I turned down the job of Ali's deputy for personal reasons, but times have changed. So my colleague Marina Hyde rings No 10 for my application form. It's a sign of how well open government has caught on under Ali that the first person refuses to give her name.</p> <p>Then Anne Shebas comes on. \"There isn't a position available,\" she begins primly. Ah, so it's been filled already? A long pause ensues. \"There isn't a position available. You're simply referring to something in the papers.\" Yes, and presumably it's you lot who placed it there. \"There is no position available,\" she repeats. \"I have nothing more to say. Goodbye.\" I like this Anne's style.

Of course, we'll miss the merriment - who can forget him being questioned by a detective who'd read the cobblers here about him and Jill Dando? Then again, the career opening excites me. A few years ago I turned down the job of Ali's deputy for personal reasons, but times have changed. So my colleague Marina Hyde rings No 10 for my application form. It's a sign of how well open government has caught on under Ali that the first person refuses to give her name. Then Anne Shebas comes on. \"There isn't a position available,\" she begins primly. Ah, so it's been filled already? A long pause ensues. \"There isn't a position available. You're simply referring to something in the papers.\" Yes, and presumably it's you lot who placed it there. \"There is no position available,\" she repeats. \"I have nothing more to say. Goodbye.\" I like this Anne's style.

It may need only a slight swing back to the Tories and the helpful nudge of a few hundred Muslim voters to send him packing. Elsewhere, in Ilford South, a bitter gloves-off battle has ensued between local Muslims and Mike Gapes, whose majority of 14,000 may not be as comfortable as it appears.

In Jack Straw's seemingly unassailable constituency, Blackburn, the rumour mill is churning out news of a challenge to the home secretary.</p> <p>What connects these disparate and uncoordinated local challenges - and the list is far from exhaustive - is that they are the work of second and third generation Muslims whose motivation has less to do with class and race than religion. Gardiner and Gapes are being targeted because of their Zionist associations - both are members of Labour Friends of Israel. Although Godsiff has been sensitive to local pressure to back Kashmiri independence, he has failed to support calls for an end to sanctions against Iraq and the Russian invasion of Chechnya. As for Straw, he is being cast as the draconian enforcer of the anti-Muslim Terrorism Act 2000.</p> <p>Some of these challenges are more optimistic than real, some are merely symbolic.

A confidential MoD document seen by the Guardian reveals that detailed negotiations are under way with three bidders to take over duties at up to 96 locations, including sites in Britain, Germany and Cyprus. All three bidders are threatening job cuts. As well as providing fire and crash cover, the bidder winning the 25-year contracts would refuel and tow aircraft, control aircraft movements on the ground and clear ice and snow from runways and planes. The winner, which will be selected by Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, would also be required to support \"operational deployments\", such as peacekeeping in the Balkans. The Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Menzies Campbell, last night warned that the proposals could compromise security and urged ministers not to get locked into long, inflexible agreements. \"These services will be provided at some of the most sensitive military sites in the country,\" said Mr Campbell. \"There are bound to be questions about security and it does seem pretty strange that this contract is to run for 25 years. There will be not much opportunity for a change of policy during that period.\" Labour has sold off a growing number of MoD services despite criticism of earlier privatisations, including damage caused to RAF fighters by a private maintenance contractor. The MoD document, headed \"restricted - commercial\", was prepared for the department's equipment approvals committee. It discloses that the winning bidder would assume responsibility for 3,500 vehicles worth \u00a3350m, in addition to the workers involved. \"The airfield support services project aims to pass responsibility for certain airfield services, currently undertaken by some 2,100 MoD civilians, to a private sector provider,\" says the report. \"These services consist of fire-crash cover, aircraft fuelling, movements and air cargo handling, airfield clearance, aircraft services and a part of air traffic control services (the runway caravan).\" Civilians at Gibraltar's RAF base would be kept in MoD employment for \"political reasons\" while a \"memorandum of understanding\" to provide fire cover at seven US airfields in the UK must be renegotiated. Three consortia have started negotiating ahead of the proposed sell-off in April 2003. One group, Logicair, includes Serco, whose safety record was criticised when it bid unsuccessfully for the civilian national air traffic control services scheduled to be privatised shortly after the election. Another, Approach Services, includes BP and the Lex vehicle leasing company, and plans to cut 300 of the 2,100 jobs. The third, Airside, set up by Amey Ventures and British Midland Handling, is promising savings of up to a third by involving firms such as Unipart to provide vehicle parts. Service personnel would be \"embedded\" within the privatised services, in some cases directing staff and reporting back to the MoD, which would retain overall control. An MoD spokeswoman denied security would be jeopardised by the plans and said: \"We are looking to get the best value for money and cost effectiveness for airfield support. We will make an announcement when there is something to announce.\" But the creation of what would be Britain's first large-scale civilian fire service has alarmed trade union leaders who fear it might be extended to fighting fires outside bases.

      "body": "<p>The Home Office has amassed an arsenal of new generation weaponry, including electrical stun weapons, rubber ball rounds, laser guns and glue guns, which are being tested for possible use by police forces.</p> <p>Government officials have requested samples of products from arms manufacturers in Europe and the US in the past six months, amid the concern of chief constables that forces need access to more powerful, \"less lethal\" weapons, if the drastic step of arming officers with guns is to be avoided.</p> <p>Among products obtained by the Home Office are an electric stun gun that paralyses the central nervous system, a device that temporarily blinds the target by overloading the optic nerve, and a weapon that fires bean bags filled with lead shot, knocking the target to the ground.</p> <p>Officials from the defence evaluation and research agency have also travelled to California to investigate a laser that fires an ultra-violet beam that paralyses the subject. Prototypes of the \"tetanizing beam weapon\", a version of which can disable the electrical system of a car, tank or aeroplane, will be ready for testing within a year.</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that Dera and the police scientific development branch were reviewing \"the full range\" of less lethal technology available, and would select specific weapons for possible deployment to officers.</p> <p>The weapons being reviewed included water cannon, stun guns, rubber ball rounds and glue weapons.</p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers has pressed for forces to be given access to weapons that have been restricted in the UK but are widely used elsewhere.</p> <p>CS gas is the only \"non-lethal\" option for mainland UK forces, although Sussex police last month became the first force to be issued with pepper spray on a trial basis. Nottinghamshire is the only mainland force to arm officers on the beat.</p> <p>Any new technology would have to be tested and approved by the Home Office, but some forces have been impatient for results. Representatives from Sussex, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire and Hertfordshire constabularies were among delegates at an alternative weapons trade fair in Florida in February.</p> <p>This month the Northern Ireland Office published a report on the first stage of its own investigation of alternative weaponry. The study was in response to the Patten report on policing, which called for a safer alternative to plastic bullets.</p> <p>It has examined weapons including chemical sprays, smoke grenades, laser and stun guns, baton rounds and incapacitation devices using nets and glue.</p> <p>Steve Tuttle, director of government and law enforcement affairs for the laser weapon manufacturers Taser International, said the Home Office late last year had requested two samples of its Advanced Taser M26.</p> <p>The weapon fires two probes a distance of up to five metres, delivering a 50,000 volt electric shock that sends the victim into a foetal position on the floor.</p> <p>The company had been trying to interest the Home Office in its product for six years, Mr Tuttle said. He felt that the present trial indicated a change in its attitude to alternative weaponry. \"They are now trying to get several of these emerging technologies into the Home Office to see if they are viable.\"</p> <p>The human rights organisation Liberty said it welcomed weapons that could reduce the risks to officers and individuals being arrested, but it was concerned about how they would be used. \"They have to be accompanied by rigorous training and restrictive guidelines on their use,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p><b>What they might use</b><br></p> <p><b> Taser</b><br>A gun-like device that fires two probes up to 21ft. These can penetrate up to two inches of clothing, before delivering a five second, 50,000 volt electric shock.</p> <p><b> Laserdazzler</b><br> A laser gun that resembles a torch but temporarily blinds the subject for up to 15 minutes. It fires a random series of green flashes up to 400m, which block out part of the light spectrum.

      "bodyText": "The Home Office has amassed an arsenal of new generation weaponry, including electrical stun weapons, rubber ball rounds, laser guns and glue guns, which are being tested for possible use by police forces. Government officials have requested samples of products from arms manufacturers in Europe and the US in the past six months, amid the concern of chief constables that forces need access to more powerful, \"less lethal\" weapons, if the drastic step of arming officers with guns is to be avoided. Among products obtained by the Home Office are an electric stun gun that paralyses the central nervous system, a device that temporarily blinds the target by overloading the optic nerve, and a weapon that fires bean bags filled with lead shot, knocking the target to the ground. Officials from the defence evaluation and research agency have also travelled to California to investigate a laser that fires an ultra-violet beam that paralyses the subject. Prototypes of the \"tetanizing beam weapon\", a version of which can disable the electrical system of a car, tank or aeroplane, will be ready for testing within a year. A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that Dera and the police scientific development branch were reviewing \"the full range\" of less lethal technology available, and would select specific weapons for possible deployment to officers. The weapons being reviewed included water cannon, stun guns, rubber ball rounds and glue weapons. The Association of Chief Police Officers has pressed for forces to be given access to weapons that have been restricted in the UK but are widely used elsewhere. CS gas is the only \"non-lethal\" option for mainland UK forces, although Sussex police last month became the first force to be issued with pepper spray on a trial basis. Nottinghamshire is the only mainland force to arm officers on the beat. Any new technology would have to be tested and approved by the Home Office, but some forces have been impatient for results. Representatives from Sussex, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire and Hertfordshire constabularies were among delegates at an alternative weapons trade fair in Florida in February. This month the Northern Ireland Office published a report on the first stage of its own investigation of alternative weaponry. The study was in response to the Patten report on policing, which called for a safer alternative to plastic bullets. It has examined weapons including chemical sprays, smoke grenades, laser and stun guns, baton rounds and incapacitation devices using nets and glue. Steve Tuttle, director of government and law enforcement affairs for the laser weapon manufacturers Taser International, said the Home Office late last year had requested two samples of its Advanced Taser M26. The weapon fires two probes a distance of up to five metres, delivering a 50,000 volt electric shock that sends the victim into a foetal position on the floor. The company had been trying to interest the Home Office in its product for six years, Mr Tuttle said. He felt that the present trial indicated a change in its attitude to alternative weaponry. \"They are now trying to get several of these emerging technologies into the Home Office to see if they are viable.\" The human rights organisation Liberty said it welcomed weapons that could reduce the risks to officers and individuals being arrested, but it was concerned about how they would be used. \"They have to be accompanied by rigorous training and restrictive guidelines on their use,\" said a spokesman. What they might use Taser A gun-like device that fires two probes up to 21ft. These can penetrate up to two inches of clothing, before delivering a five second, 50,000 volt electric shock. Laserdazzler A laser gun that resembles a torch but temporarily blinds the subject for up to 15 minutes. It fires a random series of green flashes up to 400m, which block out part of the light spectrum. Japanese police might use them for crowd control in the 2002 World Cup. Bean bag gun Fires 40g \"socks\" filled with lead shot, which knock the subject to the ground. Designed to be \"non-penetrating\" and spread the impact over a wide surface area, delivering a blow comparable to \"a punch from a professional boxer\".

      "bodyText": "Peaktime share down Since October 16 BBC1 has averaged a 28.6% peaktime share, compared with 30.2% in the equivalent period 12 months earlier. But BBC insiders are quick to point out that peaktime multichannel viewing has been rising over the same period, from 11.1% to a 13.1% audience share. Ratings up between 9pm and 10pm Between October 16 2000 and March 25 this year, the average BBC1 audience across this hour has been 6.6m. This is up by 0.8m compared with the equivalent period in 1999-2000. In audience share terms, BBC1 has raised its game between 9pm and 10pm year-on-year from 23.7% to 26.3%. ITV's performance undented So far ITV has hardly been affected by the changes to the BBC1 schedule. The network's overall peaktime share over the past six months has been 35.9% - ever so slightly down from the 36.1% it recorded 12 months earlier. And ITV's share of viewing between 9pm and 10pm has actually increased slightly year-on-year, by 0.3% to 35%. Ten O'Clock News versus News at Ten? A draw Both BBC1 and ITV can claim credit in the TV news wars. ITV reinstated its News at Ten for an average of three nights a week on January 22. Between then and Monday April 9, 5.1m viewers on average have tuned into both the BBC1 Ten O'Clock News and ITV's late evening bulletins. This, however, includes at least two nights a week when there is no News at Ten on ITV. When the 10.15pm, 10.30pm or 11pm ITV bulletins are taken out of the equation, the result is different, however. When it comes to a head-to-head battle at 10pm, News at Ten comes out on top, averaging 6m viewers. The Ten O'Clock News versus the Nine O'Clock News? A draw Overall, going back to the start of the Ten O'Clock News on October 16, the new BBC1 bulletin has still averaged 5.1m viewers - exactly the same as the average for the old Nine O'Clock News in 2000.

      "body": "<p><strong>Yahoo! and porn - what's the big deal?</strong><br> The internet media giant Yahoo! bowed to customer criticism on Good Friday when it agreed to remove all pornography from its shopping and auction channels, as well as reject similar advertising. <br> Yahoo! said its US site would take a few weeks to remove offending material but that it could still be on sale on its other portals around the world. Yahoo!'s individual country managers have been told to make up their own policy on porn matters, but it is unlikely they will fail to follow the lead of Yahoo! US. </p> <p><strong>Why was Yahoo! so keen on porn in the first place?</strong><br> It was the money, stupid. Having been a victim of the current slump in online advertising sales, Yahoo! was hoping it could cash in on one of the internet's most profitable areas - porn. <br> When the world's media cottoned on to Yahoo!'s plan to expand its revenues from porn, the company initially came back with platitudes such as, \"We're taking extra precautions by placing adult merchandise and products behind a secure firewall.\" To enter 'porn areas' Yahoo users would have to enter their credit card details and verify their age.</p> <p><strong>What happened?</strong><br> Just two days after Yahoo! came out in defence of its controversial \"Adult and Erotica\" store featuring hard-core porn tapes, it caved in to widespread objections and said it would remove all pornography from its shopping and auction services. Within hours, much of the offending material was gone. <br> Jeff Mallett, Yahoo!'s president and chief operating officer, put a statement up on Yahoo's press website late Friday saying that, \"While Yahoo! has offered controlled access to adult products available via the Internet since launching our commerce services more than two years ago, many of our users voiced concerns this week about some of the products sold by merchants on Yahoo! Shopping. We heard them and swiftly responded.\"</p> <p><strong>But why did Yahoo! back-pedal?</strong><br> Because it received a barrage of criticism after the Los Angeles Times ran a piece saying Yahoo! was upping its carriage of porn. Yahoo! clearly didn't want a repeat of last year's Nazi memorabilia fiasco when the auction of weapons, uniforms and recruitment posters on one of its sites landed the internet giant in court, so it quickly did a u-turn to make sure it didn't get back into people's bad books. Yahoo was put in a glaringly uncomfortable spotlight.<br> The flap over porn came as Yahoo! faced increasing financial woes, staff discontent and headhunting troubles after a number of key executives have quit. It didn't need to become embroiled in a smear campaign. <br> In the end, it was easier for Yahoo! to simply pull the plug on porn. </p> <p><strong>Was Yahoo! right to ditch porn?</strong><br> Morally yes, but commercially no. Yahoo! has been in the financial doldrums of late and with porn being such a strong revenue driver, this would perhaps be the kind of boost Yahoo! needed. A posting on the dot.com death website, Fuckedcompany.com, said it all: \"They would have made a shitload of money and the complainers would have stopped caring after two weeks.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yahoo! and porn - what's the big deal? The internet media giant Yahoo! bowed to customer criticism on Good Friday when it agreed to remove all pornography from its shopping and auction channels, as well as reject similar advertising. Yahoo! said its US site would take a few weeks to remove offending material but that it could still be on sale on its other portals around the world. Yahoo!'s individual country managers have been told to make up their own policy on porn matters, but it is unlikely they will fail to follow the lead of Yahoo! US. Why was Yahoo! so keen on porn in the first place? It was the money, stupid. Having been a victim of the current slump in online advertising sales, Yahoo! was hoping it could cash in on one of the internet's most profitable areas - porn. When the world's media cottoned on to Yahoo!'s plan to expand its revenues from porn, the company initially came back with platitudes such as, \"We're taking extra precautions by placing adult merchandise and products behind a secure firewall.\" To enter 'porn areas' Yahoo users would have to enter their credit card details and verify their age. What happened? Just two days after Yahoo! came out in defence of its controversial \"Adult and Erotica\" store featuring hard-core porn tapes, it caved in to widespread objections and said it would remove all pornography from its shopping and auction services. Within hours, much of the offending material was gone. Jeff Mallett, Yahoo!'s president and chief operating officer, put a statement up on Yahoo's press website late Friday saying that, \"While Yahoo! has offered controlled access to adult products available via the Internet since launching our commerce services more than two years ago, many of our users voiced concerns this week about some of the products sold by merchants on Yahoo! Shopping. We heard them and swiftly responded.\" But why did Yahoo! back-pedal? Because it received a barrage of criticism after the Los Angeles Times ran a piece saying Yahoo! was upping its carriage of porn. Yahoo! clearly didn't want a repeat of last year's Nazi memorabilia fiasco when the auction of weapons, uniforms and recruitment posters on one of its sites landed the internet giant in court, so it quickly did a u-turn to make sure it didn't get back into people's bad books. Yahoo was put in a glaringly uncomfortable spotlight. The flap over porn came as Yahoo! faced increasing financial woes, staff discontent and headhunting troubles after a number of key executives have quit. It didn't need to become embroiled in a smear campaign. In the end, it was easier for Yahoo! to simply pull the plug on porn. Was Yahoo! right to ditch porn? Morally yes, but commercially no. Yahoo! has been in the financial doldrums of late and with porn being such a strong revenue driver, this would perhaps be the kind of boost Yahoo! needed. A posting on the dot.com death website, Fuckedcompany.com, said it all: \"They would have made a shitload of money and the complainers would have stopped caring after two weeks.\"",

The changes are likely to be announced when M&amp;S reports its annual profits on May 22. </p> <p>The ailing store chain is also expected to name two new design heads this week. It is bringing them in to oversee womenswear and menswear, in an attempt to win back dissatisfied customers and halt the recent slide in sales. </p> <p>A senior insider has estimated that women's clothing sales have fallen by up to 25% in recent weeks. The design duo, both of whom are being brought in from outside the M&amp;S group, are currently in the final stages of contract negotiations. </p> <p>Womenswear, which is crucial to any turnaround at M&amp;S, has proved to be a bigger problem than M&amp;S first had thought. Over the past 18 months the group has repeatedly stated that its new ranges would be winners, only to see shoppers spurn them. </p> <p>In December, according to internal M&amp;S documents, the retailer was expecting womenswear sales to be \u00a31.3bn this year, some \u00a370m less than last year.

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer is understood to be planning a top-level management reshuffle as it struggles to rediscover its winning formula. The revamp will focus on amalgamating the two boards that run the business. The changes are likely to be announced when M&amp;S reports its annual profits on May 22. The ailing store chain is also expected to name two new design heads this week. It is bringing them in to oversee womenswear and menswear, in an attempt to win back dissatisfied customers and halt the recent slide in sales. A senior insider has estimated that women's clothing sales have fallen by up to 25% in recent weeks. The design duo, both of whom are being brought in from outside the M&amp;S group, are currently in the final stages of contract negotiations. Womenswear, which is crucial to any turnaround at M&amp;S, has proved to be a bigger problem than M&amp;S first had thought. Over the past 18 months the group has repeatedly stated that its new ranges would be winners, only to see shoppers spurn them. In December, according to internal M&amp;S documents, the retailer was expecting womenswear sales to be \u00a31.3bn this year, some \u00a370m less than last year. It cut prices by more than \u00a360m to generate more sales, but the move generated only \u00a312m as customers were still not tempted to buy. Its menswear ranges have performed equally badly. Sales there are forecast to be 10% down on last year's level, at \u00a3800m. Prices in that department were cut by more than \u00a332m, but profits still slid by \u00a317m. The chairman, Luc Vandevelde, who remains under pressure over a potential \u00a3800,000 bonus, admitted at the weekend that he was considering a change in the boardroom structure. If a reshuffle goes ahead it will be the third in two years. In the past two-and-a-half years the board has been almost completely replaced.

      "body": "<p>Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, slashed prices yesterday as a suspected slump in demand prompted a sell-off in its shares. </p> <p>Shares in the California-based company were down 5% to $26.62 (\u00a318.50) yesterday morning after a leading analyst issued a profits downgrade because of slowing demand. Intel's shares have fallen from a 52-week high of $75 last September. Prices of Intel's powerful Pentium 4 chips were cut by up to 19% yesterday as part of its attempt to stimulate demand. Several Wall Street analysts believe that yesterday's cuts - part of a monthly pricing review - will be followed by even more drastic changes before the month ends. </p> <p>Dan Niles, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, is among those who believe that prices for various Pentium 4 models could be cut by up to 60%. </p> <p>The changes are expected to spark a bitter price war in the semiconductor market, which has been hit hard by the sharp downturn in demand for hi-tech products. </p> <p>Analysts fear the price cuts will harm margins and fail to stimulate sufficient demand to compensate for the downturn. </p> <p>Ashok Kumar, an analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said: \"It's going to have a catastrophic impact on gross margins.\" </p> <p>Intel regularly cuts prices to avoid stock build-ups as new products come on to the market. But a 60% cut in a month would be the sharpest for years at Intel, which controls more than 80% of the world's microprocessor market. </p> <p>The gloomy outlook for the chip industry prompted a sell-off in technology shares yesterday. At noon, the Nasdaq composite index was off 31 points at 1,930, erasing some of last week's 14% gain. </p> <p>Seth Walker, an Intel spokesman, confirmed yesterday's price cuts but refused to discuss any future announcements. The company is expected to launch a 1.7GHz Pentium 4 chip later this month. The launch of more powerful chips is typically followed by price-cuts in slower models. </p> <p>Intel issued the latest of a series of profits warnings last month when it announced 5,000 job cuts around the world. Falling demand from some of the world's largest computer manufacturers and a slowing economy have hit the company's profits. </p> <p>Mark Edelstone, analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his earnings outlook on Intel and the rest of the chip sector for this year and next on the eve of Intel's quarterly results, due out today. </p> <p>The leading Wall Street analyst cut his earnings estimate by 25% from 60 cents to 45 cents for the current year.2222</p>",

      "bodyText": "Intel, the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, slashed prices yesterday as a suspected slump in demand prompted a sell-off in its shares. Shares in the California-based company were down 5% to $26.62 (\u00a318.50) yesterday morning after a leading analyst issued a profits downgrade because of slowing demand. Intel's shares have fallen from a 52-week high of $75 last September. Prices of Intel's powerful Pentium 4 chips were cut by up to 19% yesterday as part of its attempt to stimulate demand. Several Wall Street analysts believe that yesterday's cuts - part of a monthly pricing review - will be followed by even more drastic changes before the month ends. Dan Niles, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, is among those who believe that prices for various Pentium 4 models could be cut by up to 60%. The changes are expected to spark a bitter price war in the semiconductor market, which has been hit hard by the sharp downturn in demand for hi-tech products. Analysts fear the price cuts will harm margins and fail to stimulate sufficient demand to compensate for the downturn. Ashok Kumar, an analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said: \"It's going to have a catastrophic impact on gross margins.\" Intel regularly cuts prices to avoid stock build-ups as new products come on to the market. But a 60% cut in a month would be the sharpest for years at Intel, which controls more than 80% of the world's microprocessor market. The gloomy outlook for the chip industry prompted a sell-off in technology shares yesterday. At noon, the Nasdaq composite index was off 31 points at 1,930, erasing some of last week's 14% gain. Seth Walker, an Intel spokesman, confirmed yesterday's price cuts but refused to discuss any future announcements. The company is expected to launch a 1.7GHz Pentium 4 chip later this month. The launch of more powerful chips is typically followed by price-cuts in slower models. Intel issued the latest of a series of profits warnings last month when it announced 5,000 job cuts around the world. Falling demand from some of the world's largest computer manufacturers and a slowing economy have hit the company's profits. Mark Edelstone, analyst at Morgan Stanley, slashed his earnings outlook on Intel and the rest of the chip sector for this year and next on the eve of Intel's quarterly results, due out today. The leading Wall Street analyst cut his earnings estimate by 25% from 60 cents to 45 cents for the current year.2222",

      "body": "<p>The Rokeby Venus has had a few adventures. When Velazquez painted her in the mid-17th century in Catholic Spain, she had to be hung discreetly away from Inquisitorial eyes, and she was still under wraps 150 years later when the Duchess of Alba gave her as a present to Spain's first minister. He kept Venus and Cupid, as the painting was then called, in a private room of saucy art that also contained a painting apparently conceived as a parody of it: Goya's Naked Maja (1800). </p> <p>Velazquez's nude came to Britain in 1813, to hang at Rokeby Hall in Yorkshire, and then in 1906 was purchased for the National Gallery and for the first time went on permanent public view. The consequences were catastrophic. At 11am on March 10, 1914, a woman was seen to stare at the Rokeby Venus for some time and the next minute set about \"hacking furiously at the painting with a chopper which, it is assumed, she had concealed under her jacket\". This was the Suffragette Mary Richardson, protesting at the treatment of Emmeline Pankhurst in Holloway prison but adding in 1952: \"I didn't like the way men visitors gawped at it all day long.\" </p> <p>Repaired, celebrated, recently reframed and certainly not shocking any more, the Rokeby Venus hangs today in state - only to be subjected to one more ignominy, one more act of vandalism. The painter Nicholas Barker has copied it, emulating the luxuriant, silky brushstrokes, get ting the structure, if not the precise texture, of the painting just right; then, over Venus, he has spliced in a nastily pornographic 1970s centrefold model. While the copied details from Velazquez are aged, rich, Old Masterish, the Playmate's skin is sleek, fetishy, with the coldness of a photograph. </p> <p>Barker's vandalised Old Masters are the most immediately striking things in an exhibition that claims \"to inject some life into the dead dog of painting\". The show is called Death to the Fascist Insect that Preys on the Life of the People and is curated by painter and self-publicist Martin Maloney. And it has definitely got something going for it: vulgarity. In Britain now avant-garde art is the new religion, and when you go to Tate Modern it's clear what the prime relics are, those Minimalist objects by Don Judd and Carl Andre. Then you look at what's on in London'sEast End and it seems every young artist is trying to make a statement more coolly restrained than the last. Bad taste is sorely lacking from today's art scene. </p> <p>Maloney's claims to be spokesman for a generation are pretty much exhausted, given the critical condemnation of his last outing, Die Young Stay Pretty at the ICA, and his close involvement in Charles Saatchi's Neurotic Realism. This time, however, he seems to have his tongue in his cheek. The show's silly title is a piss-take of the very idea of an avant-garde storming the bastions, driving the fascist insects out of the castle of high culture, and so on. The very location of the show is a travesty of the rhetoric of the East End. It takes place in a crumbling, abandoned building with lots of neglected space for young artists to colonise. But this building is in the heart of the West End and is owned by the international art dealer Anthony d'Offay and is to be converted into a hi-tech art space by Sir Norman Foster. Maloney has short-circuited the avant-garde fantasies of contemporary art - the dance of small spaces and big dealers - admitting right off that the tough rhetoric is phoney. </p> <p>Do Maloney and co reanimate the corpse of painting? It's embarrassing to look at Barker's canvases. In addition to the Velazquez he exhibits personal tributes to two Titian masterpieces, the Penitent Magdalen and the Venus of Urbino, both in the Uffizi in Florence. The warmly painted skin of Titian's Venetian beauties is replaced by the intensely tanned, hard flesh of porn stars; the titillating way in which Titian reveals Mary Magdalen's nipples through her long hair is brought crassly to the point by Baker's centrefold with her Farrah Fawcett hair. The jokes are in the details: the oaky, undulating locks of the Magdalen are contrasted with the airbrushed lifeless hair of the model; the Magdalen's hand on her heart is replaced by the model's hand next to her crotch. But can you look long enough to notice these parallels? </p> <p>Painting has been going on for too long, is too saturated in convention and tradition, ever to be truly \"youthful\" or \"in-your-face\". To paint is to do some thing recherch\u00e9, not to mention bourgeois, and the lengths to which contemporary artists go in order to make painting hip, abolishing every colour but one, copying images from Vogue, only make painting look more foolish, more vulnerable. Painters can't paint as if they were the first painter in the way that it's possible to make videos as if you were the first video artist. Painters need to paint as if they were the last painter, relating themselves to everything that has gone before. This is why painting worth its salt is never restrained. It's tasteless in its consumption and vomiting of the past. Goya parodies Velazquez, and Nicholas Barker parodies Goya parodying Velazquez. </p> <p>The significance of the tangled story of Velazquez's Rokeby Venus is that it once troubled its viewers; and the history of modern art is of painters becoming bolder in their attempts to do this and make painting live. Manet's Olympia, the prostitute replacing Velazquez's Venus, is one of the modernist paintings Barker recapitulates; and then there's C\u00e9zanne's Modern Olympia and Courbet's The Origin of the World. All this is in Barker's ugly, imposing pictures. </p> <p>It's in Elizabeth Neal's crass pop collage-paintings too, which fill a room with body parts, tabloid headlines and the mentality of someone spray-painting obscenities under a motorway bridge. And in Kirsten Glass's pictures, which reek of a teenager's bedroom with their cut-up magazine faces and sexy daydreams. These pictures are tacky, but that's evocative of the history of painting, the sillier uses to which painting has always been put. Fragonard painted ridiculous erotic scenarios too. </p> <p>Martin Maloney may be pushy but at least he appears to like art, and so do the painters he promotes here. Martin McGinn's Iceland, a vast perspective view down an aisle of the frozen-food store, is not nearly as dull as it sounds. Actually, you could look at it for hours. This is because it is made of receding planes of creamy paint whose luxury of texture and colour - golds, crimsons, olive green, flesh pink, the purest white - intimates deliberately, and rather more subtly than Barker, the glory of Velazquez. Even the scale and recessive grandeur of the space is a restaging of Velazquez's Las Meninas. Instead of the king and queen, whose faces we see in the mirror at the back of Velazquez's painted room, we see at the end of the aisle a man in shirt and tie with no face, just a blank disc. </p> <p>But the stars of the show are a collective of eight painters who call themselves Hobbypopmuseum. They come from various parts of Europe, live in London and have created something truly excessive, a sprawling, ludicrous installation of big, loosely painted canvases. They give you a satisfaction that only grows with time. This palace of painted surfaces, wrapped around pillars as well as dominating the walls, is easy to dismiss as derivative. It's obviously indebted to the late painter and prankster Martin Kippenberger. It also pays homage to Gainsborough in its louche landscapes, Daumier in its caricatures conjured in a couple of brushstrokes, Tiepolo in its decorative magnificence. There are painted tower blocks that remind you again of what a pointless artist Julian Opie is as they take his banal architectural motifs and breathe life into them. </p> <p>Once you get past the jokey profusion, you notice that these painters can paint. The terrorists, planes held at airports and interrogation rooms on which their imaginations immaturely feast have a sensual presence; the hooded figure marching across one canvas with a machine gun looks like a Republican mural if it had been painted by a French Impressionist. </p> <p>Promiscuous and in poor taste, this is a visual pleasure, which is what painting is supposed to be. It's easy to imagine one of the Hobbypop artists turning out to be a real painter, a brash eater of art history. Nothing about this show justifies premature celebrations of painting's resurrection, but at least it presents work that is literate in its own traditions, and therefore has a chance of a future. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Anthony d'Offay Gallery, 6 Haunch of Venison Yard, London W1 (020-7499 4100), until May 5.

      "body": "<p>There is a fax machine in the toilet of Colin Matthews's house in Wandsworth, south London, and a large pile of recent communications. Their location is open to several interpretations, but the one I prefer is that Matthews is always active, working, thinking of ways to propagate contemporary music in his many guises. As composer, teacher, administrator and record producer, he has taken on a task that would have given Sisyphus pause for thought. </p> <p>After all, we don't even know what to call this music: \"new\", \"serious\", \"contemporary classical\"? Record companies are often loath to commit it to disc. Orchestras seem happy to give first performances, but how many will play new pieces thereafter? Audiences are small. Few composers, even those as established as Matthews, can make a living from their compositions alone. Where contemporary music is concerned, we deny ourselves context and continuity: we label it difficult but its difficulties stem from our unwillingness to engage with it. It is a vicious circle that only we, the prospective audience, can break. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I feel composers have no role whatsoever,\" Matthews once said, after the hostile reaction to the performance of Harrison Birtwistle's Panic at the 1995 Proms. \"If we withdrew our labour, nobody would notice, and quite a few people would give a cheer.\" That bleak statement is hard to square with the evangelising Matthews, who produces records of British contemporary music on the NMC label, helps run the Holst and Britten estates, and has been made professor of composition at the Royal College of Music - and so it proves. The panic seems to have passed. </p> <p>\"Most of the things I do are attempts to break through the wall blocking contemporary music,\" he explains. \"That's the reason I got NMC going. I'm optimistic that the wall will get broken through, but sometimes it does feel as if you're banging your head against it. I don't know whether it's our fault or because music is now so available: we're fighting for shelf space in a way that has never happened before. And composers have become a different breed. The composer of the 19th century was always a performer, and contemporary music was the only music that was played.\" </p> <p>I first met Matthews last autumn at a play-through of a new piece called Continuum, commissioned by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group and financed under its \"sound investors\" scheme. Matthews was meeting his backers, and there was great warmth between them. Even though the piece, only 10 days or so from its premiere, was not quite complete, the shareholders evidently had confidence in the creative director. </p> <p>Matthews wrote about the genesis of Continuum for the magazine Aret\u00e9 last year. What is intriguing about his account is how discontinuous the process of composition was. The piece evolved over three years, interrupted by other commitments - adjudicating a composers' competition in Jerusalem, supervising the recording of Anthony Payne's reconstruction of Elgar's Third Symphony, and a disastrous couple of months working on the score for the Hugh Hudson film My Life So Far, only for Miramax to drop it and commission a new score from Howard Blake. </p> <p>Matthews was also simultaneously working on three other commissions, including one fraught with danger - the addition of Pluto to Holst's Planets. Would audience or critics forgive such heresy? Happily for Matthews, they did. Once the media had stoked the fires of controversy, he expected to be booed at the premiere last May, but the piece was encored and has been well received in subsequent performances. </p> <p>Like Continuum, Matthews's Horn Concerto, which will be premiered at the Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, also had a prolonged birth. \"It was commissioned in the mid-1990s, and I did a lot of work then, but the premiere was postponed. I did a lot of sketching in 1997, then tied the sketches up and didn't reopen them until last November. I was horrified: they were awful.\" While the shape of the piece and some of the ideas have survived, he had to start the music itself more or less from scratch. </p> <p>That separation of intellectual impulse and musical realisation is characteristic of Matthews. \"I do think of things visually and architecturally,\" he says. \"It's a failing in some ways, and it probably reflects the fact that my background is not particularly musical. I never went through the normal academic mill and I can't just let the music come out; it has to be constructed. But that can be an advantage because I come in at a rather odd angle.\" </p> <p>Matthews makes a similar point when he refers to his early affinity with Michael Tippett. \"Tippett sometimes seems to be almost struggling to find the notes, and I found that very inspiring, particularly the music from The Midsummer Marriage onwards to the late 1960s. After that, the notes were coming more easily, and the music tails off as a result.\" </p> <p>Matthews taught himself to compose. He and his elder brother David, who is also a composer, grew up in Leytonstone, east London. They learned piano and decided to throw themselves into composing in their early teens. Their lives have developed in parallel ever since: both studied classics at Nottingham University before formally studying composition; both worked with Benjamin Britten, and both helped Carl Davis on scores for silent films such as The Wind. The brothers remain close, occasionally collaborate, and now live about a mile apart. </p> <p>\"It's an odd relationship but it's never been adversarial,\" says Colin, at 55 the younger by three years. \"We've always felt encouraged by the other's success. Coming from a non-musical background, there was no reason that either of us should have become composers, let alone both of us, so there's been a strength in that.\" </p> <p>The teenage Colin must have been frighteningly intense. At 14, already a Mahlerian, he heard Deryck Cooke's \"performing version\" of Mahler's 10th Symphony on the radio (the composer had left only sketches of the work on his death). Matthews borrowed a score, studied it, and wrote to Cooke pointing out errors and infelicities. \"Amazingly, instead of slapping me on the head and telling me to go away, he said that no one had ever written anything quite like that before and that he welcomed the comments,\" Matthews recalls. \"I went to meet him, we talked for hours and from then on it became a collaboration.\" </p> <p>The collaboration lasted 10 years as Cooke prepared the score for publication. \"We had to take what Mahler left in the state he left it,\" says Matthews. \"Deryck was adamant that there would be no recomposition. You could add detail, but it was a rule that nothing would be changed, even where it was obvious that Mahler had been working in extreme haste.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of this period, Matthews began working with Britten, copying scores and later, as Britten became weaker physically, as his amanuensis. \"He didn't really like talking about music,\" says Matthews, \"though in the last three years of his life his personality changed and I was able to talk much more freely to him. He was aware that I was a composer and asked to see some pieces of mine, which was generous because he didn't normally do that. </p> <p>\"He had had a heart operation, which left him with a weakness on his right side. He could only play the piano with his left hand, so he asked me to come and play things through for him. That went on until his death [in 1976], and I took over the orchestration of his last two pieces.\" In 1980, Matthews became a trustee of the Britten foundation, and later became chairman of the Britten estate. </p> <p>Matthews's work with Britten in Aldeburgh also brought him into contact with Imogen Holst, who was editing her father's work, and the two collaborated until her death in 1984. He became director of the Holst foundation, and over the past 20 years his income as a paid administrator for the two estates has, he says, allowed him to survive as a composer. Without it, he would have had to concentrate on film and TV work. His experience on My Life So Far suggests that was a fate he did well to avoid.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is a fax machine in the toilet of Colin Matthews's house in Wandsworth, south London, and a large pile of recent communications. Their location is open to several interpretations, but the one I prefer is that Matthews is always active, working, thinking of ways to propagate contemporary music in his many guises. As composer, teacher, administrator and record producer, he has taken on a task that would have given Sisyphus pause for thought. After all, we don't even know what to call this music: \"new\", \"serious\", \"contemporary classical\"? Record companies are often loath to commit it to disc. Orchestras seem happy to give first performances, but how many will play new pieces thereafter? Audiences are small. Few composers, even those as established as Matthews, can make a living from their compositions alone. Where contemporary music is concerned, we deny ourselves context and continuity: we label it difficult but its difficulties stem from our unwillingness to engage with it. It is a vicious circle that only we, the prospective audience, can break. \"Sometimes I feel composers have no role whatsoever,\" Matthews once said, after the hostile reaction to the performance of Harrison Birtwistle's Panic at the 1995 Proms. \"If we withdrew our labour, nobody would notice, and quite a few people would give a cheer.\" That bleak statement is hard to square with the evangelising Matthews, who produces records of British contemporary music on the NMC label, helps run the Holst and Britten estates, and has been made professor of composition at the Royal College of Music - and so it proves. The panic seems to have passed. \"Most of the things I do are attempts to break through the wall blocking contemporary music,\" he explains. \"That's the reason I got NMC going. I'm optimistic that the wall will get broken through, but sometimes it does feel as if you're banging your head against it. I don't know whether it's our fault or because music is now so available: we're fighting for shelf space in a way that has never happened before. And composers have become a different breed. The composer of the 19th century was always a performer, and contemporary music was the only music that was played.\" I first met Matthews last autumn at a play-through of a new piece called Continuum, commissioned by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group and financed under its \"sound investors\" scheme.

Matthews was also simultaneously working on three other commissions, including one fraught with danger - the addition of Pluto to Holst's Planets. Would audience or critics forgive such heresy?

He's absolutely terrible.' \" </p> <p>Four years later, theatre-lovers can rest easy. Walsh, 20, is putting his voice to use as a singer, and his band are the hottest property in British rock. At the start of this year almost every music publication in the land predicted great things for Wigan boys Starsailor, dubbed \"the new Coldplay\" before they had even released a record. They have now been on the cover of NME, done Top of the Pops and joined the Brats tour of rising new bands. Starsailor's label, EMI, said it would be \"delighted\" if their first release entered the top 100; in the event, the Fever EP went in at 18. The next single, Good Souls - an uplifting, electric affair that should dispel associations with the morose new acoustic movement - deserves to do even better. </p> <p>\"It's been insane,\" says Walsh, who has a hushed speaking voice but sings in a hurricane falsetto. \"But because everything's happened so quickly, it's been easier to keep our feet on the ground. We're still the same people.\" And perhaps that's true, since none of the hyperbole has come from Starsailor themselves. \"You get bands who shout from the rooftops about how good they are, but deep down they tend to be the most unconfident, with no real ability whatsoever,\" says Walsh. \"Terris said they were going to make the best album ever. How can you follow that? It's just putting extra pressure on yourselves. We tend to keep quiet, because we know we're doing our best.\" </p> <p>Drummer Ben Byrne and bassist James Stelfox have been playing together since the age of nine, when Stelfox was given a bass by his father, and formed the band with Walsh four years ago at a Wigan college for drama and music. They played \"horrible\" gigs across the north-west with various guitarists, under names such as Waterface or Morph. The present name came from an album by Tim Buckley, father of singer-songwriter Jeff, to whom they are often compared. </p> <p>\"I love Jeff Buckley,\" Walsh admits. \"You have to be honest about you're inspired by. But my songs start off a lot more Buckley than they finish. I have so much respect, I'd never try to copy him.\" </p> <p>Seeing the Verve at their Wigan Haigh Hall gig in 1998 was a turning point for Walsh. However, while noting the ambition of the hometown headliners, he was particularly drawn to the support act, folk-rocker John Martyn. \"He got the worst reception I've ever seen,\" Walsh remembers. \"They were throwing bottles of piss at him! But he had real soul.\" </p> <p>Starsailor's line-up was completed last year when Barry Westhead joined on keyboards. Shortly afterwards, Byrne, Stelfox and Walsh (who now does guitar duties) moved into the same house, where they live with their roadie, Les, who \"drinks like a fish and has one lung. It's like the Monkees.\" </p> <p>This being the rock world, things could go wrong any minute. But for the moment Starsailor are on a roll. Walsh has had a marriage proposal, the band already have a stalker and they have undergone the attentions of record company stylists after turning up to a video shoot looking like tramps. More importantly, they have enough killer tunes to cause Coldplay and others a few sleepless nights. </p> <p>\"It helps that we're all close friends,\" says Stelfox. \"You look around and there's three of your best mates with you.\" </p> <p>Are they comfortable with being styled? \"I'm comfortable with it all,\" insists Walsh. \"I've always dreamed of singing in a band and everything that goes with it.

In his first act as military governor of rebel territory in the Nuba mountains since Kuwa's death on March 31, Abdel Aziz Adam el-Helo last week convened the Nuba's advisory council, or parliament. More than 200 delegates who had walked for up to three days to attend the meeting voted unanimously against surrender, according to Commander Helo, who leads the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in the region. \"They said: 'Yousif brought us out of the caves and opened the door for us to express ourselves as Nuba',\" Commander Helo said in an interview in the secret mountain location where Kuwa was buried with full military honours on April 10. \"Yousif's death has depressed people because he was a teacher and a father, but they are still committed. People are determined - they want a way out,\" he said. In the year before his death, illness kept Kuwa away from the mountains. Government troops, militias and \"holy warriors\" captured much of the Nuba's best agricultural land, forcing starving civilians to flee to government garrisons where the only possible identity is an Arab-Islamic one. Ambushes and rape increased significantly in the plains between the mountains, cut off from the world since the National Islamic Front seized power in 1989. Since arriving among the African Nuba two months ago, Commander Helo - a friend of Kuwa and reputed to be one of the SPLA's most effective leaders - has been reorganising to try to seize the initiative for the first time in a decade. He has two priorities: \"To recapture productive land and to ensure that the democratic process instituted by Yousif continues and flourishes.\" Morale was high at Kuwa's funeral as 120 soldiers escorted the coffin to the foothills from the rough airstrip that is the Nubas' only gateway to the world. \"Yousif had the vision.

The Netherlands became the first country to legalise it last week. Bernard Kouchner said in Le Monde yesterday that he would open a debate on the right of incurably sick people to have their lives ended. Reuters, Paris Easter killings in Colombia An Easter Sunday attack left nine people dead when hundreds of leftwing guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia stormed a village controlled by far-right militias, the authorities said yesterday. Houses and cars were burned in La Caucana in north-western Antioquia province. Reuters, Bogota Sudan silent on BBC reporter The family of a Reuters and BBC reporter, Alfred Taban, detained last week during a demonstration in Khartoum, said yesterday they had no word of him. Geert Linnebank, Reuters' editor-in-chief, has written to ask President Omar al-Bashir to release Mr Taban, a Sudanese national. Reuters, Cairo Australians dive for free beer Dozens of Australians put on scuba gear to dive for 24,000 bottles of lager lost after a truckload of beer fell into a river at Tweed Heads, north of Sydney, at the weekend. One man alone was reported to have netted 400 bottles. Patrick Barkham, Sydney Yemen arrests bomb suspects Five people suspected of ties to Islamist terrorist cells were arrested at the weekend in an investigation into October's bombing of the destroyer USS Cole. In the past three weeks, 20 people have been arrested in Aden, where the attack took place. Seventeen US sailors were killed and 39 wounded. AP , Sanaa Baby turtles spawn hope Thousands of baby Olive Ridley turtles have begun crawling out of eggs laid on India's east coast, making officials hopeful that the species can be pulled back from the brink of extinction.

Bobby Sands, the first of 10 Irish Republicans who died in the Maze prison hunger strike in 1981, lived for only 66 days after his protest began. Some of the Turkish hunger strikers have been refusing food for nearly six months, although they have been taking sugar, salt and vitamin B to prolong their lives - and the protest. The government says it is up to inmates, and the illegal organisations to which they belong, to end the protest. But the strike will provide ammunition to critics who say Turkey has a long way to go before it can begin negotiations on membership of the European Union.",

It accused Syria of encouraging such attacks to ratchet up the pressure as it confronts a Palestinian revolt.</p> <p>\"The rules of the game have changed. We will extract a price from Syria if they fail to constrain Hizbullah,\" a spokesman for the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said.</p> <p>The cycle of attack and reprisal remained unbroken.

      "bodyText": "Israel launched air, sea and ground attacks on the Gaza Strip last night, capping a day that saw tensions climb sharply all over the Middle East. Helicopter and navy gunships bombarded a post of Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17 security section in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, and armoured bulldozers, backed by tank fire, rolled into Palestinian-ruled territory at Beit Hanoun, in the north of the territory. The twin assaults came less than 24 hours after Israeli warplanes attacked a Syrian radar station in Lebanon, heightening international concerns that the bloody seven-month Palestinian uprising could fuel violence elsewhere in the region. As fears grew of the possibility of a direct confrontation between the two great enemies of the Middle East following the Israeli attack on Lebanon, Jordan led a flurry of international demands for restraint. \"We think this is an unjustified escalation that will have a negative effect on the security and stability of the region,\" the visiting Jordanian foreign minister, Abdul-Ilah Khatib, said in Jerusalem. \"Once again the use of force will not solve anything on the ground.\" The overnight attack - the first deliberate strike on a Syrian position in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion - marks a steep escalation of Israel's response to attacks by Hizbullah guerrillas. Three Syrian soldiers were killed in the raid, which Israel said was in retaliation for the killing of a soldier by Hizbullah guerrillas on its northern frontier at the weekend. It accused Syria of encouraging such attacks to ratchet up the pressure as it confronts a Palestinian revolt. \"The rules of the game have changed. We will extract a price from Syria if they fail to constrain Hizbullah,\" a spokesman for the hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, said. The cycle of attack and reprisal remained unbroken. Hours after the raid on Lebanon, Palestinian militants fired mortar shells on the southern development town of Sederot, which lies inside the borders of the Jewish state. The missiles landed harmlessly, but the attack on Sederot, about three miles from the Gaza Strip, fed Israeli fears that the Palestinians are beginning to get greater range from their home-made mortar launchers, and are singling out population centres. The army's inevitable retaliation arrived swiftly. In Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, Israel launched its third ground invasion of Palestinian-ruled territory in a week, sending tanks and bulldozers to pound two police buildings. Hours later, the airforce attacked Deir al-Balah, injuring three people. The spasm of violence demonstrated the ease with which events on Israel's northern frontiers can fuel an escalation in the West Bank and Gaza. Most of the Hizbullah attacks have focused on a disputed stretch of the northern border called the Shebaa Farms. Although the UN says the territory is part of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Hizbullah claims it is Lebanese and should have been evacuated when Israel ended its 18-year occupation in May. In recent weeks Israeli military officials have claimed evidence of growing collaboration between the Lebanese militants and Palestinian groups; they claim to have uncovered a Hizbullah cell which has fired mortars on Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. Hizbullah remained defiant yesterday saying in a statement from Beirut that it would choose its moment, and its means, for taking revenge. \"We will chop off the hand of the enemy which reached into our land and our brothers'. \"We will turn Sharon's dream of terrorising our people into a nightmare that will chase the defeated, invading Zionist army, their terrorist bases and their camps,\" the statement said. The Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, said the attack \"revealed anew the blood-coloured policies\" of Mr Sharon, the architect of Israel's 1982 invasion. Meanwhile in Damascus, an official spokesman called the reprisal attack \"a challenge to the will of the Arab nation\". The angry exchanges sharpened concern in Washington, Paris, Bonn, London and Moscow, where there were universal calls for restraint.

The sun was setting, sending glorious bright orange streaks across a calm ocean as we cracked open a bottle of champagne and enjoyed the relaxed moment and more of Tony's yarns. It felt a great privilege to be one of the nine crew on board Team Legato, helping Tony fulfil his dream of racing non-stop round the world.</p> <p>Back in our home city of Bristol, over the previous two years Tony and I shared many Sunday mornings eating bacon sandwiches and drinking mugs of tea on the dockside. As we chatted he outlined his project for The Race, and every so often he would reveal a little more of his fascinating past and I got a glimpse into the very individual mind of this most enigmatic sailor.</p> <p>Tony is obviously best known for his sailing exploits and his dramatic rescue from the southern ocean in 1997, but in Bristol he is also known as one of the city's great characters.

      "bodyText": "Tony Bullimore celebrated his 63rd birthday aboard the giant catamaran on which he has just sailed around the world. The sun was setting, sending glorious bright orange streaks across a calm ocean as we cracked open a bottle of champagne and enjoyed the relaxed moment and more of Tony's yarns. It felt a great privilege to be one of the nine crew on board Team Legato, helping Tony fulfil his dream of racing non-stop round the world. Back in our home city of Bristol, over the previous two years Tony and I shared many Sunday mornings eating bacon sandwiches and drinking mugs of tea on the dockside. As we chatted he outlined his project for The Race, and every so often he would reveal a little more of his fascinating past and I got a glimpse into the very individual mind of this most enigmatic sailor. Tony is obviously best known for his sailing exploits and his dramatic rescue from the southern ocean in 1997, but in Bristol he is also known as one of the city's great characters. Over the years he has owned a number of nightclubs in the city - the Granary and the Bamboo are fondly recalled by those now too old for the austere techno caverns favoured by the kids of today. Tony doesn't often talk about the deep-rooted connections he has with the city's Afro-Caribbean community, however, on many occasions as we sailed together, he mused about the time not too far off, when he will retire with his wife Lalel to her native Jamaica. My communication station on board Legato was near Tony's bunk and the ship's main satellite phone, so I was there when they spoke fondly to each other on his birthday. Too soft you might think from such a bulldog of a man with his famous will of steel, yet I saw that gritty determination, even stubbornness, in fair measure too. For several days we were becalmed in the notorious equatorial doldrums and when we picked up wind again, somebody noticed that one of our wind generators wasn't turning properly. This time Tony wasn't sailing single-handed, and with the luxury of a crew he could easily have dispatched someone to sort it out. But he decided this was a task he was going to do himself. Armed with a pocketful of spanners and screwdrivers he perched precariously on a communications dome and stolidly took the thing apart bit by bit before it became apparent that the fault was terminal and we didn't have the kit on board to fix it. A more comical example of Tony's behaviour came shortly after we crossed the equator when the weather was warm, but the wind was picking up.

      "body": "<p>For three days I sat in the public gallery of court number six, heart in mouth and eyes fixed on the top of the head in the dock. It was all I could see of the man everyone was talking about. He was an angry man, they said. Volatile. Prisoner H10109 had been locked up for the past 20 years for a brutal murder he said he hadn't committed. This was his last chance to prove his innocence. If this appeal failed he knew he would die in prison. It was a real-life drama unfolding before my eyes and I had persuaded my boss and John Kamara to let me film him from the moment he got out. If he got out.</p> <p>The appeal had been running for three days when suddenly the judges took their leave. Nobody knew what was going on. It was a strange place to stop. A detail of one of the witness statements, which had been buried for 20 years, was being examined. The judges had drawn their heads together in a huddle and then, suddenly, they got up and left. Everyone in the court room - lawyers, journalists and supporters sat in tense silence. Five minutes later, the judges returned and abruptly told the defence barrister, Michael Birnbaum QC, that Kamara's conviction had been quashed. Nobody moved a muscle. There wasn't a murmur. All my preconceived notions of families jumping in the air, shouting in jubilation, were out of place that day. The judges didn't have a single word of apology for Kamara. Their thanks went to the lawyers. They didn't even look at the man who had been robbed of 20 years of freedom.</p> <p>An hour later, I stood at the back door of the appeal court and waited for Kamara to come out into the sunshine. Finally, I met the man who, until an hour before, was classed as one of the country's most dangerous men. He was quietly spoken and bemused. He said he didn't understand what the judges were saying when they quashed his conviction. He thought he was being taken back to the cells, then he heard one of the security guards saying he would be going home.</p> <p>The trouble was, he had no home. We got into a taxi and started filming as we pulled out of the court precinct. A small crowd of supporters shouted and cheered as we drove out on to the Strand and Kamara flinched and blinked in the glare of the lights. I didn't want to rush in with 101 idiotic questions so we sat in the taxi - Kamara, his brother, a friend, me, and a colleague, Sara Hardy, who was operating a video camera - in silence. The atmosphere was charged as, for what seemed like an hour, we drove through London and looked at the view.</p> <p>When I viewed the raw footage later I was amazed to discover it only lasted eight minutes. Then I began talking to Kamara. He was friendly and kind but punch-drunk. When he found the words to express himself they came in a jolt. He said it felt as if the taxi was driving too fast. Later, he would tell me that everything seemed to be going too fast, even people walking looked as if they were scurrying about on fast-forward. His eyes couldn't take in the colour because in prison everything is grey, so on that first journey, the tones, to him, were like an overexposed photograph. Finally, we arrived at Paddy Hill's house. The two men had met in Parkhurst prison in the early 80s - eight years before Hill's release as one of the Birmingham Six. Kamara was going there because he had nowhere else to go. At the court he had been given \u00a346 and a travel pass that ran out that evening at 8pm. He left with sacks and sacks of court papers and one set of clothes. As an innocent man, nobody in authority had responsibility for Kamara. He didn't fall into the remit of the probation service because they only deal with guilty people. He had spent 16 of the past 20 years in solitary confinement fighting his case. No human contact for 23 hours a day. Day after day. Year after year. He had been told when to eat, sleep and exercise for two decades and now he was being put back on the streets with no help at all.</p> <p>When we got to Hill's house we continued filming. Suddenly the tables had turned for Kamara. After all those years of being told what to do, I started asking him for opinions and permission to film. He didn't know what I wanted him to do, but I didn't want him to do anything for the camera. I wanted him to be natural but he didn't know what natural was.</p> <p>We stopped filming when it got dark. News crews were turning up, thrusting huge cameras about the place. Kamara was giving interviews and saying he was waiting for a prison guard to tell him to get behind his cell door. Sara Hardy packed up the camera and we left. I shook Kamara's hand on the way out.</p> <p>The next time I spoke to Kamara he was going to Liverpool, so we met there. He had stunned me by saying he was going to meet the father of the victim of the crime for which he had been imprisoned. BBC Radio Merseyside had tracked Kamara down and invited both men on to its live phone-in show the next day. For years, John Suffield, the victim's father, had believed Kamara was guilty. Now he wanted to meet him. I arranged to be there, too, and film the meeting. Afterwards, Kamara and I would return to London on a train. I had heard stories of other people released from long prison sentences who had freaked out on a fast-moving vehicle or gone berserk if an unwitting bystander had shut the door on them while in a small room.</p> <p>The radio interview went well. The two Johns showed nothing but mutual respect and it was plain that Kamara was comforted by Suffield declaring publicly in a loud, clear voice that he was an innocent man. Suffield had sat through the appeal. He knew that Kamara was not one of two men who had bound his son, a betting shop manager, to a swivel chair and tortured him for the combination to the safe. It was a combination the manager could not give because, in his terror, his stammer worsened and he could not get the words out. It was another emotional, highly charged day for Kamara, made worse by the huge cameras of the local news crews who followed him everywhere. He was happy with ours because it was so small and, probably, because we were two women who didn't crowd him. But the bulk of the crews and their equipment nearly panicked him.</p> <p>Over the following months Kamara and I spoke daily and met regularly. Sometimes Sara or another colleague came too and filmed. Other times, we just sat and chatted. Kamara had a rollercoaster of a life those first few months - tracing and meeting lost siblings, trying to get benefits to live on, trying to come to terms with the fact that, after a 20-year battle to clear his name, people now expected him just to forget about it. He had virtually no friends and nothing to do except go over the case papers which had been the focus of his life for so long. He was not offered counselling; he needed people to talk to.</p> <p>I had to resolve issues too. How do you draw the line when you are so personally involved? There were times when I thought Kamara would end up homeless because he didn't exist in the eyes of the social services and wasn't eligible for housing. Should I offer my spare room? I couldn't film with him all day and then leave him out in the cold, but I couldn't save him either. How could I make a film about the injustice done to people freed after wrongful conviction, but step in and provide the food and shelter he was denied?</p> <p>Three months after Kamara's release he reached his lowest point. He had arranged to go to the House of Commons to meet his MP, Louise Ellman, with whom he had corresponded regularly from prison. We arranged to meet at Westminster underground station where we had permission to film Kamara's arrival. It had always been virtually impossible to ask Kamara to do anything for the camera. He felt self-conscious walking in or out of a building for us, so we couldn't get set-up shots. He would get angry and anxious and was in danger of de-camping entirely; we always had to grab whatever we could on the hoof. On this particular June morning, Kamara was in such a state of despair he could barely talk to me. We were held up at the tube station by a delegation of Japanese businessmen on a guided tour. Every time I tried to go up to Kamara to explain, he would cross the street and walk away. He looked gaunt and was a shadow of the punch-drunk but dignified man released from prison a few months previously.</p> <p>At times, Kamara would telephone to say he didn't want any more to do with the film. He would shout and rant and say he was pulling out of the project and wanted all the tapes. He was still being messed around by social services and had no home of his own. He couldn't sleep and spent most nights sitting up at Alexandra Palace, staring at the distant lights of London, wishing he was back in prison. He needed some outlet for the anger that had reached boiling point and I was one of a small number of people with whom he had regular contact.</p> <p>A year on, I class Kamara as a friend. He is now spending his time trying to help other prisoners who claim to be innocent. He has a strong network of supportive friends and family. He has his own home; he has even found love and plans to marry.</p> <p>I have acted as a kind of counsellor to him at times, but have also had to keep a distance and observe. It has been a difficult line to tread, but it has allowed me to witness the extraordinary strength of his character: Kamara survived in spite of the system, not because of it.</p> <p>\u0095 Life After Life, a Rough Justice special, is on BBC1 tonight at 10.35pm.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1956, when private galleries were rare outside London, Howard Roberts, who has died aged 79, established the Howard Roberts Gallery, Wales's first successful commercial art gallery. It generated interest in Welsh artists, and showed work by names in modern British art such as Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson and Bridget Riley.</p> <p>Roberts was born in Cardiff and attended Cardiff High School. In his teenage years, a voyage to Italy opened his eyes to Renaissance architecture and the riches of Florence's Uffizi Gallery.

      "bodyText": "In 1956, when private galleries were rare outside London, Howard Roberts, who has died aged 79, established the Howard Roberts Gallery, Wales's first successful commercial art gallery. It generated interest in Welsh artists, and showed work by names in modern British art such as Henry Moore, Ben Nicholson and Bridget Riley. Roberts was born in Cardiff and attended Cardiff High School. In his teenage years, a voyage to Italy opened his eyes to Renaissance architecture and the riches of Florence's Uffizi Gallery. From 1938 to 1941, he attended Cardiff College of Art, where he met his first wife, Joan Prosser. His education was interrupted by gruelling war service in North Africa, as a wireless operator in the 57th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, but he eventually transferred to a camouflage unit in company with other artists. Towards the end of the war he taught art in Florence and met the war artists Carel Weight and William Coldstream. From 1947 to 1955, Roberts taught at Tiverton Art School in Devon, after which he returned to Cardiff to concentrate on painting.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jenny Male pours herself a glass of white wine to calm her nerves and suggests we get a few things straight before we start. \"Look, babe, these are the ground rules. No names of ex-husbands or children. And I'd rather you didn't mention where I live.\"</p> <p>Being in control is important to Male. Now, perhaps, more than ever. For most of her strikingly privileged life - public school, famous friends, wealthy partners - she felt dependent on others. Then, three years ago, when she was single and, for the first time, penniless, she found a freelance job that paid her a half-decent wage and allowed her to break free from a troubled past. The career? Prostitution.</p> <p>With income came the freedom to manage her own time; to read, to study at university, to see her children. At 42, Male was enjoying independence. But she didn't have it for long.</p> <p>It was ripped from her, she says, and much more besides, by a Sunday tabloid which three weeks ago exposed her life as a \"secret call girl\", shortly after she appeared as a contestant on the BBC quiz The Weakest Link, hosted by Anne Robinson.</p> <p>She thought she had persuaded the News of the World not to run the story, but a piece appeared anyway - on Mother's Day - leaving her no time to tell her sons, aged 23, 21 and 17, and her daughter, who is 14. None of them knew, or even suspected. The boys in particular were devastated. \"You could have done anything else and we'd have forgiven you, but not this,\" said one. Another claimed his \"whole world had fallen apart\".</p> <p>\"To see them hating me,\" Male says, \"to see them so cold and hard, when we have always been so close - it took away feelings from me that prostitution never could. I hope I can get them back.\"</p> <p>Male understands their reaction - she was brought up to believe prostitution was \"totally vile\" - but she wants them to listen to her. Morality works on all sorts of levels, she says.</p> <p>So how did a self-confessed Sloane Ranger, who grew up in a six-bedroom Worcestershire farmhouse, (with live-in nanny, housekeeper and maids), and went on to marry men who had respectable, well-paid jobs, end up becoming a suburban escort?</p> <p>The crunch came, she explains, in the mid-1990s, following the break-up of her second marriage, when she was alone and trying to raise four children with virtually no money. \"I'd been trying to meet new men, going out on dates with people who had advertised in the Sunday Times magazine. They were wealthy Yorkshire farmer types. They'd take me to expensive restaurants and give me lovely presents. But what use were they to me? I didn't need another fantastic meal or Gucci handbag. I needed to pay for food in Tesco and I wanted time with my children.\"</p> <p>When one of her regulars called to ask her out again, she suggested alternative entertainment. \"I told him I would see him, but that it would cost \u00a3100. And instead of having dinner, I said, why don't we just go to bed? It seemed a much more honest exchange of my time for his money. He wanted to sleep with me, so why go through a four-hour dinner ordeal?</p> <p>\"I'm not prudish about sex. It is a pleasurable thing. I didn't tell anyone because of the way society treats prostitutes. Did I feel ashamed or embarrassed? No, I felt terrific.\"</p> <p>Male vetted her clients by asking a series of questions of anyone who answered her newspaper ad. Those who spoke eruditely had a chance. Those who didn't were fobbed off. She charged \u00a370 for every half hour and saw no more than two men per day.</p> <p>After a series of failed relationships, there was, she says, a simplicity to sleeping with strangers. \"I know lots of women in unhappy marriages who are forced into sex. I have suffered violence and abuse from boyfriends, but not once from a client. I'm always on top, so they cannot trap me.</p> <p>\"When men sleep with a prostitute, they wear a condom because they are worried about catching something. You try to get a man to wear a condom when you are on a date! I didn't feel cheap being an escort. Feeling cheap is when you sleep with a man and never get a call the next day.\"</p> <p>Appearing on The Weakest Link was, Male says, rather foolish. During the show, which was broadcast on Monday March 26, she told Anne Robinson she was a housewife from Sussex. Someone watching knew it was a lie and two days later, a well-spoken man made an appointment. He told her he was \"in property\" and was heading for a meeting at Gatwick airport. The man paid Male \u00a370, but then took a call on his mobile phone and said he had to leave immediately.</p> <p>Male says she tried to give the money back, but he insisted.</p> <p>Male was the victim of a classic tabloid expos\u00e9. In a blind panic, she demanded to speak to a senior editor to plead that the story should not be printed. \"I told him the pain and hurt this would heap on my children. He told me the paper was doing me a favour because I'd been putting myself in great danger as a prostitute.\"</p> <p>Male agreed to see a journalist face to face and by Saturday evening she was urging a reporter who had flown to the Algarve not to pursue the story.

      "bodyText": "Jenny Male pours herself a glass of white wine to calm her nerves and suggests we get a few things straight before we start. \"Look, babe, these are the ground rules. No names of ex-husbands or children. And I'd rather you didn't mention where I live.\" Being in control is important to Male. Now, perhaps, more than ever. For most of her strikingly privileged life - public school, famous friends, wealthy partners - she felt dependent on others. Then, three years ago, when she was single and, for the first time, penniless, she found a freelance job that paid her a half-decent wage and allowed her to break free from a troubled past. The career? Prostitution. With income came the freedom to manage her own time; to read, to study at university, to see her children. At 42, Male was enjoying independence. But she didn't have it for long. It was ripped from her, she says, and much more besides, by a Sunday tabloid which three weeks ago exposed her life as a \"secret call girl\", shortly after she appeared as a contestant on the BBC quiz The Weakest Link, hosted by Anne Robinson. She thought she had persuaded the News of the World not to run the story, but a piece appeared anyway - on Mother's Day - leaving her no time to tell her sons, aged 23, 21 and 17, and her daughter, who is 14. None of them knew, or even suspected. The boys in particular were devastated. \"You could have done anything else and we'd have forgiven you, but not this,\" said one. Another claimed his \"whole world had fallen apart\". \"To see them hating me,\" Male says, \"to see them so cold and hard, when we have always been so close - it took away feelings from me that prostitution never could. I hope I can get them back.\" Male understands their reaction - she was brought up to believe prostitution was \"totally vile\" - but she wants them to listen to her. Morality works on all sorts of levels, she says. So how did a self-confessed Sloane Ranger, who grew up in a six-bedroom Worcestershire farmhouse, (with live-in nanny, housekeeper and maids), and went on to marry men who had respectable, well-paid jobs, end up becoming a suburban escort? The crunch came, she explains, in the mid-1990s, following the break-up of her second marriage, when she was alone and trying to raise four children with virtually no money. \"I'd been trying to meet new men, going out on dates with people who had advertised in the Sunday Times magazine. They were wealthy Yorkshire farmer types. They'd take me to expensive restaurants and give me lovely presents. But what use were they to me? I didn't need another fantastic meal or Gucci handbag. I needed to pay for food in Tesco and I wanted time with my children.\" When one of her regulars called to ask her out again, she suggested alternative entertainment. \"I told him I would see him, but that it would cost \u00a3100. And instead of having dinner, I said, why don't we just go to bed? It seemed a much more honest exchange of my time for his money. He wanted to sleep with me, so why go through a four-hour dinner ordeal? \"I'm not prudish about sex. It is a pleasurable thing. I didn't tell anyone because of the way society treats prostitutes. Did I feel ashamed or embarrassed? No, I felt terrific.\" Male vetted her clients by asking a series of questions of anyone who answered her newspaper ad. Those who spoke eruditely had a chance. Those who didn't were fobbed off. She charged \u00a370 for every half hour and saw no more than two men per day. After a series of failed relationships, there was, she says, a simplicity to sleeping with strangers. \"I know lots of women in unhappy marriages who are forced into sex. I have suffered violence and abuse from boyfriends, but not once from a client. I'm always on top, so they cannot trap me. \"When men sleep with a prostitute, they wear a condom because they are worried about catching something. You try to get a man to wear a condom when you are on a date! I didn't feel cheap being an escort. Feeling cheap is when you sleep with a man and never get a call the next day.\" Appearing on The Weakest Link was, Male says, rather foolish. During the show, which was broadcast on Monday March 26, she told Anne Robinson she was a housewife from Sussex. Someone watching knew it was a lie and two days later, a well-spoken man made an appointment. He told her he was \"in property\" and was heading for a meeting at Gatwick airport. The man paid Male \u00a370, but then took a call on his mobile phone and said he had to leave immediately. Male says she tried to give the money back, but he insisted. Male was the victim of a classic tabloid expos\u00e9. In a blind panic, she demanded to speak to a senior editor to plead that the story should not be printed. \"I told him the pain and hurt this would heap on my children. He told me the paper was doing me a favour because I'd been putting myself in great danger as a prostitute.\" Male agreed to see a journalist face to face and by Saturday evening she was urging a reporter who had flown to the Algarve not to pursue the story. The paper went ahead re gardless. \"A friend called me at 8am to say I was on the front page. I rang home immediately and spoke to my son. I told him something awful had happened, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him what it was. I didn't know what to say. I'd never considered myself a whore before it was written in the paper. For the first time in my life, I felt I'd been raped.\" On Sunday evening, her daughter and middle son flew to Portugal for the most difficult meeting of all their lives. \"I met them at the airport and my son's body language said it all. The next morning we went for a walk along the beach and he told me I had destroyed the family.\" Knowing that the News of the World hoped to run a second story the following week, Male needed advice on damage limitation. She rang international directory inquiries and asked for Max Clifford in London. The number was in the book. Clifford advised her to give the News of the World a story or risk seeing it print whatever it liked. She cooperated and was paid \u00a31,000 by the paper. Clifford received nothing. \"I told them my clients included a doctor, a judge and an Olympic gold medallist. It was rubbish, but it kept the names and photographs of those closest to me out of the paper. I was wary of ringing Max, but he gave me good advice when I was crying my eyes out and I'm grateful to him.\" Male is now back in the UK and trying to reconstruct her life. She has \"retired\" from prostitution. With the help of her daughter, she is hoping to be reconciled with her sons. \"The stuff about Mum is not going to affect the way I feel for her,\" the 14-year-old says. \"And it's not going to affect the way she feels for me.\"",

      "body": "<p>A safety warning has been issued after a passenger jet on its way to Britain was forced to land at Paris when an engine iced up, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>The plane, which was carrying 109 passengers and five crew, was a BAe 146, a series popular with charter operators on short haul flights, and also often used to ferry the royal family and government ministers.</p> <p>Pilots flying the type have been warned against exceeding a specified altitude in any situation that could involve icy weather.</p> <p>The plane was cruising at 28,000ft on its way from Marseilles to land at Stansted one evening in last June when it met a thin layer of cloud and climbed to 31,000ft, the type's maximum altitude.</p> <p>Storms forced the plane to descend to 26,000ft. The captain, aged 43 and with 7,800 hours flying experience, noticed that the fan speed of one of the four Lycoming engines was decreasing. The engine also began to overheat.</p> <p>The captain shut down the engine and was given permission to divert to Charles de Gaulle airport, where he landed safely.</p> <p>An examination of the plane's flight recorder data, according to an air accidents investigation branch bulletin yesterday, found that the engine problem was probably caused by ice; the bulletin said the other engines were unaffected because of minor variations in their condition.</p> <p>The BAe 146's icing problem had been noted in the past, and modifications made to some planes of the type but not all. Pilots flying planes with unmodified engines have to follow a revised flight manual - drawn up two years ago - prohibiting them from flying above 26,000ft in conditions where a plane is likely to encounter ice.</p> <p>In this case, the bulletin said that the revised instructions were misinterpreted. The pilot had believed he could fly above 26,000ft for a portion of the flight when there was no risk of encountering ice. The manufacturer intended that a plane should not fly above the limit at all if ice was going to be encountered at any point.</p> <p>Since the incident the manual has been rewritten to clarify the point, and the manufacturer has been told to review the risks of the problem. Extra training may also be given to pilots.</p> <p>The BAe 146 first flew commercially in 1983, and over the next 10 years more than 200 came into service.

      "bodyText": "A safety warning has been issued after a passenger jet on its way to Britain was forced to land at Paris when an engine iced up, it emerged yesterday. The plane, which was carrying 109 passengers and five crew, was a BAe 146, a series popular with charter operators on short haul flights, and also often used to ferry the royal family and government ministers. Pilots flying the type have been warned against exceeding a specified altitude in any situation that could involve icy weather. The plane was cruising at 28,000ft on its way from Marseilles to land at Stansted one evening in last June when it met a thin layer of cloud and climbed to 31,000ft, the type's maximum altitude. Storms forced the plane to descend to 26,000ft. The captain, aged 43 and with 7,800 hours flying experience, noticed that the fan speed of one of the four Lycoming engines was decreasing. The engine also began to overheat. The captain shut down the engine and was given permission to divert to Charles de Gaulle airport, where he landed safely. An examination of the plane's flight recorder data, according to an air accidents investigation branch bulletin yesterday, found that the engine problem was probably caused by ice; the bulletin said the other engines were unaffected because of minor variations in their condition. The BAe 146's icing problem had been noted in the past, and modifications made to some planes of the type but not all. Pilots flying planes with unmodified engines have to follow a revised flight manual - drawn up two years ago - prohibiting them from flying above 26,000ft in conditions where a plane is likely to encounter ice. In this case, the bulletin said that the revised instructions were misinterpreted. The pilot had believed he could fly above 26,000ft for a portion of the flight when there was no risk of encountering ice. The manufacturer intended that a plane should not fly above the limit at all if ice was going to be encountered at any point. Since the incident the manual has been rewritten to clarify the point, and the manufacturer has been told to review the risks of the problem. Extra training may also be given to pilots. The BAe 146 first flew commercially in 1983, and over the next 10 years more than 200 came into service. There are three versions: the Marseilles plane was a 300 series, built in 1989, with a maximum of 112 seats. The Queen has at her disposal three adapted BAe 146s, which can carry a maximum of 26 passengers. Last year it was reported that the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne had complained about having smelled fuel while on the planes. Earlier this year it emerged that government ministers used the royal flight more often than the Queen and her family between last April and the end of January. The government argued that royal flights were often cheaper than commercial flights. It is not known how many BAe 146s are still flying with unmodified engines. Nobody from BAE Systems, formed following a merger between British Aerospace and Marconi Electronic Systems, was available for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Police last night launched a murder inquiry after thieves deliberately drove over a woman they had just robbed. The 43-year-old from west London, who has not been named, ran after the pair as they fled with her handbag. Travellers at Euston station, central London, watched in horror as she was hurled on to the bonnet of the Ford Fiesta after she tried to stop them, but was thrown off and then crushed beneath the front wheels. Witnesses said the woman clung to the bonnet of the car for up to half a minute while the driver drove forwards and backwards at speed, trying to shake her off. The woman screamed for help but finally lost her grip and was run over by the car, as her husband looked on. Detective Inspector Martin Lee, of the Metropolitan police's serious crime group, described the incident as \"absolutely horrendous and absolutely traumatic\". \"It would appear that she was run over deliberately. I cannot say anything other than that it was a horrendous and appalling incident.\" He said detectives were examining CCTV footage from cameras at the station, adding that they were hunting a man and a woman, both white and in their mid-20s. Asked about the woman's decision to chase after the thieves, he said: \"She acted bravely on impulse.\" The woman was waiting for a train in the Cafe Ritazza coffee shop at the station with her husband at around 9am yesterday when her handbag was snatched. Justin Nam, a waiter at the cafe, said that the woman chased after the thieves, although her husband tried to stop her. The thieves then jumped into a white Ford Fiesta and tried to drive away. Det Insp Lee said the circumstances surrounding her being hit by the car were \"a little sketchy\". Martin Johnson, a Big Issue seller who was on his way to work, said he saw the car driving at between 40 and 50mph while the woman clung on to the bonnet, kicking violently. He said that the Fiesta then reversed at full speed and hit a kerb, while the woman screamed \"help me, help me\" to a nearby bus driver. \"The car then went full speed ahead and the woman's legs were now dangling over the front,\" he said. \"She lost her grip and the car went over her.

But it is made to seem foolish when \"best advice\" from British experts and scientists, said to be based on scientific facts, can be both conflicting and unreliable at best, and spun in favour of particular interests at worse. Now the chief scientist is singing a different song from the chief vet, while both seem to ignore significant information available on the internet, from sources such as the Canadian government.</p> <p>It is not surprising the public loses faith that policies are sound and credible when the Ministry of Agriculture says the foot and mouth virus can travel for as much as a 100km on dust in air currents, but that GM maize pollen will travel no more than 50m or so. We are told foot and mouth cannot infect humans (shades of BSE/CJD?), yet several sources agree it can, if only rarely, causing only flu-like symptoms with some blistering (Warwickshire county council) and \"exanthemas on fingertips and interdigital spaces, fever and miocarditis\" (Our Food website) .</p> <p>Were the strains of the picornavirus that caused rare cases of FMD in humans the same as that now in British cloven-hooved livestock? There is, apparently, no record of human-to-human transmission (Bupa website), but if the infection is rare, was this ever looked for?</p> <p>The Institute for Animal Health is the official international vaccine bank. It holds the stock vaccine, long-lasting concentrates, stored under liquid nitrogen, that have been obtained from \"commercial sources that offer the highest standards in vaccine manufacture and quality control\" (institute website). The vaccine bank was established in 1985. Presumably these vaccine sources were all created from cattle that, even at that date, could be guaranteed free from BSE. Or might there be some small reluctance to vaccinate because that cannot be certain (Afro-nets website)? <br><b> Dr Colin Leakey </b><br> Cambridge <a href=\"mailto:clal@zoom.co.uk\">clal@zoom.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 I was asked recently by a friend in the west country to set up a website which corresponds to the request made by Judith Cook (Letters, April 14).

For the sake of the whole countryside, farming must now suffer the loss of our disease free status and the loss of our export markets. Anthony Steel (farmer) Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire aisteel@aol.com \u0095 It is a sad day when one has to feel sorry for the government. But it is made to seem foolish when \"best advice\" from British experts and scientists, said to be based on scientific facts, can be both conflicting and unreliable at best, and spun in favour of particular interests at worse. Now the chief scientist is singing a different song from the chief vet, while both seem to ignore significant information available on the internet, from sources such as the Canadian government. It is not surprising the public loses faith that policies are sound and credible when the Ministry of Agriculture says the foot and mouth virus can travel for as much as a 100km on dust in air currents, but that GM maize pollen will travel no more than 50m or so. We are told foot and mouth cannot infect humans (shades of BSE/CJD?), yet several sources agree it can, if only rarely, causing only flu-like symptoms with some blistering (Warwickshire county council) and \"exanthemas on fingertips and interdigital spaces, fever and miocarditis\" (Our Food website) . Were the strains of the picornavirus that caused rare cases of FMD in humans the same as that now in British cloven-hooved livestock? There is, apparently, no record of human-to-human transmission (Bupa website), but if the infection is rare, was this ever looked for? The Institute for Animal Health is the official international vaccine bank. It holds the stock vaccine, long-lasting concentrates, stored under liquid nitrogen, that have been obtained from \"commercial sources that offer the highest standards in vaccine manufacture and quality control\" (institute website). The vaccine bank was established in 1985. Presumably these vaccine sources were all created from cattle that, even at that date, could be guaranteed free from BSE. Or might there be some small reluctance to vaccinate because that cannot be certain (Afro-nets website)? Dr Colin Leakey Cambridge clal@zoom.co.uk \u0095 I was asked recently by a friend in the west country to set up a website which corresponds to the request made by Judith Cook (Letters, April 14). The site is active and allows for correspondence and debate which is open and visible to all. It also has links to other relevant sites http://www.vexxed.co.uk Andrew Walworth London andrew.walworth@vexxed.co.uk",

      "byline": "Clare Dyer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One look at the TopShop gear and the necklace spelling out \"Foxy\" and you somehow knew, when Judith Kilshaw arrived at the high court last week, that she was not going to be allowed to take those twins home. The babies she and husband Alan had found on the internet and paid \u00a38,200 to adopt would be on their way back to Missouri, their home state, to face a new legal battle between their estranged biological parents over their future.</p> <p>The nation watched in fascinated horror as the saga unfolded. First the tiny babies were grabbed back from their first would-be adopters in California after the Kilshaws offered more money, then they were driven across America to be adopted in Arkansas, where the residency requirements, lax though they were, were flouted by the babies' mother. Doubts grew about the couple's suitability as replacement parents.</p> <p>The Kilshaws' venture into free-market baby acquisition has left them bruised by the media they courted, and tens of thousands of pounds poorer. But the tale, unedifying as it is, will leave one enduring legacy. As the twins head for their fifth short-term home in nine months of life and the battle ground over their custody shifts to a courtroom in St Louis, laws to protect future Belindas and Kimberleys are being rushed into force in Britain.</p> <p>The Kilshaws' QC, Allan Levy, maintains a discreet professional silence on his controversial clients and the merits of their case. Barristers are obliged by the cab-rank rule to pick up any litigant who happens to flag them down. But Levy - a leading child law specialist whose CV includes the Cleveland abuse inquiry in the 1980s, the Pindown children's home scandal in the early 1990s and the recent case of the Siamese twins Jodie and Mary - welcomes moves to tighten the lax controls on adoption from abroad as a vital protection for vulnerable children.</p> <p>\"The problem has been that intercountry adoption has not been properly regulated in any way,\" he says. \"At worst, it's been a bit like the Wild West, where anything went. Although there have been lots of successful intercountry adoptions, I've been involved in cases in the past where there were thoroughly unsatisfactory goings-on in certain central and south American countries and indeed one lawyer who specialised in adoption in a South American country was jailed.</p> <p>\"In certain countries where there had been civil wars, when the British embassy, perhaps at the instigation of the Official Solicitor, was investigating the source of the child, trying to track down the natural parents, they were finding addresses in war zones that were probably non-existent and certainly couldn't be reached. There was a very real likelihood that a serious racket was going on where the children were being sold or, even worse, kidnapped, or the parents were being subjected to some sort of duress or extortion.\"</p> <p>Couples brought in children without the knowledge or approval of social services and immigration officers turned a blind eye. Once the child was settled and had bonded with the new parents, the courts came under huge pressure to approve the adop tion. Had the Kilshaws kept their heads down and avoided the media, the outcome of their case might have been quite different.</p> <p>There has been only one other recent case where a child brought to the UK for adoption was sent back: last year an adoption agency in Texas got back a seven-month-old baby already removed from the prospective adopters by social services, who had deemed them unsuitable to adopt before they went to America. Had the baby been with the couple for a year, said the judge, the decision would have been much more difficult.</p> <p>\"By the time the procedures were gone through, often a year, 18 months, or two years had gone by and it was almost impossible for the court to move the child, so it was a fait accompli,\" says Levy. \"The welfare of the child demanded that the adoption order be made, even though the whole process may have been very dubious.\"</p> <p>From April 30, anyone who brings in a child from abroad without prior approval by an adoption agency and the agreement of the Department of Health will commit a criminal offence, punishable by up to three months in prison, a fine of up to \u00a35,000, or both. The new law will spell the end of immigration officers' practice of simply waving through babies who arrive in their new parents' arms without the proper entry clearance.</p> <p>The reform was planned before the internet twins hit the headlines but their story was the catalyst for rushing it into law. Ironically, though, it would probably not have stopped the Kilshaws because they had an apparently valid adoption order from the US. American adoption orders are recognised in the UK, along with those of the older Commonwealth countries and many European states. But comparatively few US children are brought into Britain for adoption; more than half now come from China, with India the next biggest source.</p> <p>A further measure will be needed to make sure that all adoptions from abroad measure up to the stringent standards that apply to home adoptions. The UK is finally on course to ratify the Hague convention on intercountry adoption next year.</p> <p>Under the convention, couples wanting to adopt a child will have to apply to a central authority here, who will send a report on the would- be parents' suitability to the corresponding authority in the child's country. The adoption will go ahead there only if the natural parents have consented, the central authorities in both countries agree, and the child has been cleared by the Home Office to settle in the UK.</p> <p>Levy, who has appeared in many adoption cases and written a book on the subject, points out that couples have felt compelled to look abroad not just because of the shortage of young babies to adopt in this country but because social services departments have been so restrictive in their adoption policies. \"One of the reasons people were driven to go abroad to countries like China, Ecuador, El Salvador and the USA is that they found social services were not approving them as adopters because they were too old at 35 or 40. Or they were thought to be too middle class or the wrong ethnic origin, or they smoked too much or were overweight. I'm amazed there hasn't been a case that has challenged social services departments on the basis that they were fettering their discretion by taking such narrow views of people who were probably admirable adopters.\"</p> <p>The government agrees that many local councils applied too restrictive a policy in the past, allowing too many children to languish in care. The tiny number of babies given up for adoption at birth means that most of the children adopted in the UK come from care, and the government wants more of them to be found permanent homes more quickly. The adoption and children bill, now going through parliament, was originally pencilled in for the government's second term; its fast-tracking is another legacy of the internet twins drama.</p> <p>\"It's horrific how many placements in care some children have,\" says Levy. \"But adoption in this country in the main means older children, and children who have had a bad start in life and who've got physical or psychological problems. The startling statistic is that one adoption in five of children in care breaks down, and for children aged nine or over the failure rate, amazingly, is 40%. So it's not a primrose path by any means. But I think the government is right to try to speed up and centralise the process because it's far too late. There also needs to be much more post-adoption support for families, and much more galvanising into action of particular councils. The disparities between the numbers of adoptions in different authorities and between the length of time different authorities take to find permanent homes for children is disturbing.\"</p> <p>But while he welcomes most of the bill, he takes issue with one of its reforms, which he thinks may breach human rights laws. One clause replaces the current provision under which a court may override a natural parent's refusal to consent to adoption, if the parent is deemed to be \"unreasonably\" withholding agreement. That provision requires the court to weigh up what a reasonable parent would do in the circumstances, and provides some safeguard for the biological parent. The new clause would simply allow the court to override the parent's refusal if the child's welfare warranted it.</p> <p>\"I think there's a real danger of social engineering,\" says Levy. \"It's not a sufficient safeguard to protect the natural parent. At first blush, what's wrong with the welfare of the child being paramount? But I think there's a great temptation for the court to say 'Well, I think that child would have a better future with the adoptive parents' - and that is pure social engineering - rather than having to say that there is no way this child's welfare can be properly protected by the natural parent and so the court is compelled to make an adoption order.</p> <p>\"I anticipate that this will be an area which will be subject to considerable discussion and opposition. I feel very uneasy about it. I think lawyers and others will make their views very firmly known to parliament - at least I hope they do.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "One look at the TopShop gear and the necklace spelling out \"Foxy\" and you somehow knew, when Judith Kilshaw arrived at the high court last week, that she was not going to be allowed to take those twins home. The babies she and husband Alan had found on the internet and paid \u00a38,200 to adopt would be on their way back to Missouri, their home state, to face a new legal battle between their estranged biological parents over their future. The nation watched in fascinated horror as the saga unfolded. First the tiny babies were grabbed back from their first would-be adopters in California after the Kilshaws offered more money, then they were driven across America to be adopted in Arkansas, where the residency requirements, lax though they were, were flouted by the babies' mother. Doubts grew about the couple's suitability as replacement parents. The Kilshaws' venture into free-market baby acquisition has left them bruised by the media they courted, and tens of thousands of pounds poorer. But the tale, unedifying as it is, will leave one enduring legacy. As the twins head for their fifth short-term home in nine months of life and the battle ground over their custody shifts to a courtroom in St Louis, laws to protect future Belindas and Kimberleys are being rushed into force in Britain. The Kilshaws' QC, Allan Levy, maintains a discreet professional silence on his controversial clients and the merits of their case. Barristers are obliged by the cab-rank rule to pick up any litigant who happens to flag them down. But Levy - a leading child law specialist whose CV includes the Cleveland abuse inquiry in the 1980s, the Pindown children's home scandal in the early 1990s and the recent case of the Siamese twins Jodie and Mary - welcomes moves to tighten the lax controls on adoption from abroad as a vital protection for vulnerable children. \"The problem has been that intercountry adoption has not been properly regulated in any way,\" he says. \"At worst, it's been a bit like the Wild West, where anything went. Although there have been lots of successful intercountry adoptions, I've been involved in cases in the past where there were thoroughly unsatisfactory goings-on in certain central and south American countries and indeed one lawyer who specialised in adoption in a South American country was jailed. \"In certain countries where there had been civil wars, when the British embassy, perhaps at the instigation of the Official Solicitor, was investigating the source of the child, trying to track down the natural parents, they were finding addresses in war zones that were probably non-existent and certainly couldn't be reached. There was a very real likelihood that a serious racket was going on where the children were being sold or, even worse, kidnapped, or the parents were being subjected to some sort of duress or extortion.\" Couples brought in children without the knowledge or approval of social services and immigration officers turned a blind eye. Once the child was settled and had bonded with the new parents, the courts came under huge pressure to approve the adop tion. Had the Kilshaws kept their heads down and avoided the media, the outcome of their case might have been quite different. There has been only one other recent case where a child brought to the UK for adoption was sent back: last year an adoption agency in Texas got back a seven-month-old baby already removed from the prospective adopters by social services, who had deemed them unsuitable to adopt before they went to America. Had the baby been with the couple for a year, said the judge, the decision would have been much more difficult. \"By the time the procedures were gone through, often a year, 18 months, or two years had gone by and it was almost impossible for the court to move the child, so it was a fait accompli,\" says Levy. \"The welfare of the child demanded that the adoption order be made, even though the whole process may have been very dubious.\" From April 30, anyone who brings in a child from abroad without prior approval by an adoption agency and the agreement of the Department of Health will commit a criminal offence, punishable by up to three months in prison, a fine of up to \u00a35,000, or both. The new law will spell the end of immigration officers' practice of simply waving through babies who arrive in their new parents' arms without the proper entry clearance. The reform was planned before the internet twins hit the headlines but their story was the catalyst for rushing it into law. Ironically, though, it would probably not have stopped the Kilshaws because they had an apparently valid adoption order from the US. American adoption orders are recognised in the UK, along with those of the older Commonwealth countries and many European states. But comparatively few US children are brought into Britain for adoption; more than half now come from China, with India the next biggest source. A further measure will be needed to make sure that all adoptions from abroad measure up to the stringent standards that apply to home adoptions. The UK is finally on course to ratify the Hague convention on intercountry adoption next year. Under the convention, couples wanting to adopt a child will have to apply to a central authority here, who will send a report on the would- be parents' suitability to the corresponding authority in the child's country. The adoption will go ahead there only if the natural parents have consented, the central authorities in both countries agree, and the child has been cleared by the Home Office to settle in the UK. Levy, who has appeared in many adoption cases and written a book on the subject, points out that couples have felt compelled to look abroad not just because of the shortage of young babies to adopt in this country but because social services departments have been so restrictive in their adoption policies. \"One of the reasons people were driven to go abroad to countries like China, Ecuador, El Salvador and the USA is that they found social services were not approving them as adopters because they were too old at 35 or 40. Or they were thought to be too middle class or the wrong ethnic origin, or they smoked too much or were overweight. I'm amazed there hasn't been a case that has challenged social services departments on the basis that they were fettering their discretion by taking such narrow views of people who were probably admirable adopters.\" The government agrees that many local councils applied too restrictive a policy in the past, allowing too many children to languish in care. The tiny number of babies given up for adoption at birth means that most of the children adopted in the UK come from care, and the government wants more of them to be found permanent homes more quickly. The adoption and children bill, now going through parliament, was originally pencilled in for the government's second term; its fast-tracking is another legacy of the internet twins drama. \"It's horrific how many placements in care some children have,\" says Levy. \"But adoption in this country in the main means older children, and children who have had a bad start in life and who've got physical or psychological problems. The startling statistic is that one adoption in five of children in care breaks down, and for children aged nine or over the failure rate, amazingly, is 40%. So it's not a primrose path by any means. But I think the government is right to try to speed up and centralise the process because it's far too late. There also needs to be much more post-adoption support for families, and much more galvanising into action of particular councils. The disparities between the numbers of adoptions in different authorities and between the length of time different authorities take to find permanent homes for children is disturbing.\" But while he welcomes most of the bill, he takes issue with one of its reforms, which he thinks may breach human rights laws. One clause replaces the current provision under which a court may override a natural parent's refusal to consent to adoption, if the parent is deemed to be \"unreasonably\" withholding agreement. That provision requires the court to weigh up what a reasonable parent would do in the circumstances, and provides some safeguard for the biological parent. The new clause would simply allow the court to override the parent's refusal if the child's welfare warranted it. \"I think there's a real danger of social engineering,\" says Levy. \"It's not a sufficient safeguard to protect the natural parent. At first blush, what's wrong with the welfare of the child being paramount? But I think there's a great temptation for the court to say 'Well, I think that child would have a better future with the adoptive parents' - and that is pure social engineering - rather than having to say that there is no way this child's welfare can be properly protected by the natural parent and so the court is compelled to make an adoption order. \"I anticipate that this will be an area which will be subject to considerable discussion and opposition. I feel very uneasy about it. I think lawyers and others will make their views very firmly known to parliament - at least I hope they do.\"",

It may have turned out even better for the Man in the Moustache's side had Deportivo not scored a late winner to finally see-off relegation-threatened Osasuna 2-1 at the Riazor. Javier Irureta's side remain 8-points behind Madrid, and now turn their attention to Leeds. Midfielder Emerson, the man who single-handedly rescued Soul-Glow during his Middlesborough days, claimed Depor can turn things around when he claimed earlier in the week that \"scoring four goals is easier than you think\". Emerson was talking about Leeds, but - in view of Bar\u00e7a's last two performances - he might be better telling that to Gerard Houllier. Osasuna's defeat against Depor leaves them second bottom, level on points with Numancia and two below Racing Santander and Real Sociedad. Numancia came from 3-1 down against la Real to secure a 3-3 draw, and could even have ended up with a win but for the intervention - three times - of the post. The gloves come off Down at the bottom no one is giving up and Numancia's battling qualities certainly aren't unique. Real Sociedad have improved since Toshack's arrival, and Racing Santander are also pulling out all the stops - they stunned form side Celta de Vigo 3-0 on Sunday, with Espina, Mazzoni and Regueiro the men on target. The result of all this is that the relegation three-from-four of a couple of weeks back might now be three-from-five (or possibly even three-from-eight). After losing 1-0 to Valladolid, Oviedo lay only two points clear of Real Sociedad and Racing. Vallodolid keeper Bizzarri (the man that finally saw john Benjamin get his marching orders at the Bernab\u00e9u) was on inspired form and helped the club ease three points clear of Radi Antic's side - not safe, but breathing a little easier. Level on points with Valladolid, and nervously looking down, are Las Palmas and Athletic Bilbao, who lost 1-0 at home to yet another Ra\u00fal Tamudo goal for Espanyol. Either side of them are M\u00e1laga and Rayo Vallecano, who drew 1-1 on Sunday. Now, there are those games that lend themselves to match reports with more puns than a dyslexic bakery. And Saturday night's clash between Valencia and Alav\u00e9s was one of them. But it was Easter, so forget that Alav\u00e9s boss, Man\u00e9 might be Vicente Del Bosque's twin brother, or that having brilliantly guided his side to the Uefa Cup semi (and probably the final) he'll almost certainly be at the helm at Valencia next year. Or even that Alav\u00e9s won 2-1. Never mind all that - what really mattered on Easter weekend was that it was Dan Eggen who scored the winner. What's more, Eggen rose (again) to head home a cross and secure all three pontius for his side. Now, what was that about a bakery?",
