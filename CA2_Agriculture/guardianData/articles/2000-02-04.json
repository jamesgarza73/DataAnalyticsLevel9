The match was in England's favour when South Africa needed seven from four balls. But Mark Ealham's next two deliveries were full tosses and the unflappable Shaun Pollock crashed them to leg for four. </p> <p>England achieved the highest score in the competition so far when they made 231 for six from their 50 overs, but they looked a little uncertain whether to be pleased with themselves or not.

The tourists brought in Alan Mullally for Craig White, who was reported as only 95% fit with a hamstring injury and was rested as a precaution; South Africa replaced Henry Williams with Pieter Strydom. </p> <p>England appeared anxious to make the most of their opening overs when Nasser Hussain pulled Nantie Hayward through midwicket for four and Nick Knight, with an absence of style, cudgelled Pollock through the same area for another boundary. </p> <p>But in the fifth over, Hussain made a premeditated charge against Pollock and was caught behind. It was not the last rash stroke played in the England innings. </p> <p>Graeme Hick, having cover-driven and square-cut with relish, then spooned Hayward to cover for 11; 35 for two in the eighth.

Knight, whose 64 came from 111 balls and included six fours, was fifth out at 144, offering a gentle return catch to a ball from Strydom that bounced more than he expected. </p> <p>Then came the most explosive batting of the innings. Mark Alleyne, whose place had been under threat and whose previous one-day best was 38, scored a violent 53. Fifteen came from one Lance Klusener over as Alleyne hit him over mid-off for six and then, next ball, straight for four. </p> <p>But his crashing innings ended after only 68 balls when he was caught in the covers, having added 74 in 13 overs with Ealham, whose 29 came from 39 deliveries. </p> <p>England had reached par. But their rather sheepish expressions betrayed the feelings of a side who feared they had not scored enough. </p> <p>They started poorly in the field. Darren Gough, looking as out of touch as he has been for most of this winter, opened with two wides and when his first three overs disappeared for 18 he was replaced by Mullally. </p> <p>It was Mullally who made the breakthrough in his second over, but he needed some good fortune; Herschelle Gibbs did not appear to have touched the ball when he was given out caught behind. </p> <p>Mark Boucher was promoted to No3 but the ploy failed.

      "body": "<p>Leicester City reacted with anger last night as their celebrations at reaching Wembley were marred by the news that five players and three backroom staff have been charged with misconduct after the Football Association's inquiry into ticket distribution for last year's Worthington Cup final. </p> <p>Less than 24 hours after the 1-0 victory over Aston Villa earned Leicester a third final in four years, the FA announced it was pressing charges in connection with the \"alleged irresponsible distribution\" of hundreds of tickets.</p> <p>Steve Guppy, Neil Lennon, Graham Fenton, Arnar Gunnlaugsson and Stuart Campbell have been charged along with the chief scout Jim Melrose, the academy director David Nish and the physiotherapist Ian Andrews. Tony Cottee and Andy Impey already faced similar charges, and the \"Leicester 10\" have been summoned to a specially convened FA hearing at Filbert Street on March 15.</p> <p>It follows the FA's investigation of the crowd violence that marred Tottenham's 1-0 win at Wembley last March after Spurs supporters obtained tickets for sections reserved for Leicester fans. But the timing of the announcement annoyed Leicester, whose manager Martin O'Neill was described as \"furious\".</p> <p>Sir Rodney Walker, chairman of the club's plc board, said: \"I am astonished that there should be a lapse of several months without us hearing anything from the FA and now they drop this on our toes the morning after we have reached a Wembley final. It is totally inexplicable.</p> <p>\"If it is a coincidence it is truly amazing. But if it is a deliberate act it is something that needs to be explored at the highest level.</p> <p>\"To choose this of all moments is an extraordinarily bad piece of timing and I will be letting the FA know my feelings on the matter.\"</p> <p>The FA charged Cottee and Impey in September and 25 players and staff were accused of failing to assist its inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Leicester City reacted with anger last night as their celebrations at reaching Wembley were marred by the news that five players and three backroom staff have been charged with misconduct after the Football Association's inquiry into ticket distribution for last year's Worthington Cup final. Less than 24 hours after the 1-0 victory over Aston Villa earned Leicester a third final in four years, the FA announced it was pressing charges in connection with the \"alleged irresponsible distribution\" of hundreds of tickets. Steve Guppy, Neil Lennon, Graham Fenton, Arnar Gunnlaugsson and Stuart Campbell have been charged along with the chief scout Jim Melrose, the academy director David Nish and the physiotherapist Ian Andrews. Tony Cottee and Andy Impey already faced similar charges, and the \"Leicester 10\" have been summoned to a specially convened FA hearing at Filbert Street on March 15. It follows the FA's investigation of the crowd violence that marred Tottenham's 1-0 win at Wembley last March after Spurs supporters obtained tickets for sections reserved for Leicester fans. But the timing of the announcement annoyed Leicester, whose manager Martin O'Neill was described as \"furious\". Sir Rodney Walker, chairman of the club's plc board, said: \"I am astonished that there should be a lapse of several months without us hearing anything from the FA and now they drop this on our toes the morning after we have reached a Wembley final. It is totally inexplicable. \"If it is a coincidence it is truly amazing. But if it is a deliberate act it is something that needs to be explored at the highest level. \"To choose this of all moments is an extraordinarily bad piece of timing and I will be letting the FA know my feelings on the matter.\" The FA charged Cottee and Impey in September and 25 players and staff were accused of failing to assist its inquiry. Those allegations have now been dropped, although advisory letters from Lancaster Gate have been sent to everyone who was investigated. Leicester's spokesman Paul Mace said: \"They should never have been charged in the first place and we would expect a full apology from the FA for the embarrassment and worry they have caused. \"We also find it hard to believe that, having qualified for a second successive final, the FA should still be nowhere near completing this inquiry. The eight concerned are extremely angry and upset and will be taking independent legal advice. It goes without saying they will be protesting their innocence most strongly.

      "body": "<p>Toy Story 2 is not a sequel. It is an upgrade. It is a manufacturer's improvement - of staggering ingenuity. It is a software refinement. It is a species leap, a higher order of being. </p> <p>This film combines a witty and charming children's fantasy in a tradition going back to the Grimm brothers and Hans Christian Andersen, with computer animation above and beyond \"state-of-the-art\". Its bright, hyperreal light, its sleek, impossibly clean planes, its laser-sharp pixellation and its extra-terrestrial landscaping will take you, in the stirring words of Buzz Lightyear himself, to infinity - and beyond!

      "bodyText": "Toy Story 2 is not a sequel. It is an upgrade. It is a manufacturer's improvement - of staggering ingenuity. It is a software refinement. It is a species leap, a higher order of being. This film combines a witty and charming children's fantasy in a tradition going back to the Grimm brothers and Hans Christian Andersen, with computer animation above and beyond \"state-of-the-art\". Its bright, hyperreal light, its sleek, impossibly clean planes, its laser-sharp pixellation and its extra-terrestrial landscaping will take you, in the stirring words of Buzz Lightyear himself, to infinity - and beyond!

The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said 97% of fees were collected in 1998-99, the first year of the means-tested system. Baroness Warwick, the chief executive, said universities made every effort to help students to cope with the charges by offering flexible payment methods. \"Higher education staff have worked hard to ensure their institutions were able to collect tuition fees, and these have paid off in large measure.\" Universities were allowed \u00a320m to cover administering the fees, and the bad debt will be written off out of that provision. But the CVCP said it was \"important that students who have not paid do so\".",

After primary school in <a href=\"\" target=\"_new\">Loughton</a>, he became a boarder at <a href=\"http://www.brentwood.essex.sch.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Brentwood School</a>. Mr Straw has admitted to bullying fellow pupils in the dorms (which he regrets) but says \"I emerged a better person from school than when I began\".</p> <p>Politics was an early interest: he was on the <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/uk/facility/awe_aldermaston.htm\" target=\"_new\">Aldermaston</a> ban-the-bomb march in April 1959, aged 12, and was only 13 when he made his first political speech, at a Labour candidate's meeting.

Within the university he was regarded as something of a conservative (he opposed, and still does, all soft drug use) but outside developed the reputation of a \"radical who plans militancy whenever he considers it necessary\". </p> <p>He was elected president of the <a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/index_flash.html\" target=\"_new\">National Union of Students</a>, age 22, in a minor coup which saw the previous president, Trevor Fisk, ousted midway through his first year of the job. Mr Fisk was the first NUS president not to see out his term.</p> <p>As president, Mr Straw politicised the NUS and warned it would come into conflict with the government on four key issues: the union's belief in comprehensive education; its opposition to racism; the fight against social deprivation; and the egalitarian growth of higher education. </p> <p>In the mid-1970s, when newspaper diarists asked \"Where are they now?\", they remembered Mr Straw as Britain's hard-left student leader.</p> <p><a name=\"C\"><b>Law, television or politics?</b></a></p> <p>At the beginning of that decade Mr Straw was completing his legal training. He left the NUS in 1971, attended the <a href=\"http://www.icsl.ac.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Inns of Court</a> law school and was called to the bar in July 1972. He was in practice as a criminal barrister until 1974. In 1977 he joined the staff of <a href=\"http://www.granadatv.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Granada Television</a>'s World in Action.</p> <p>Mr Straw returned to politics in the years in between.

At the same time he was deputy leader of the inner London education authority and served on <a href=\" http://www.islington.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Islington council</a>. As vice-chairman of the housing committee, Mr Straw was tough on pets - under his regime council tenants in possession of dogs, pigeons, large caged birds or poultry were liable for eviction. \"I am sure that people will welcome the fact that they are now allowed to keep cats,\" was Mr Straw's response at the time.</p> <p><a name=\"D\"><b>Entering parliament</b></a></p> <p>Mrs Castle stepped down from parliament in 1979 and the <a href=\"http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Blackburn</a> seat she had held since 1944 passed to her quick-witted former adviser.

Kate Winslet. To follow Titanic with Hideous Kinky shows she's following her own path and true to herself. Which film character would you like to be? George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life. He goes on a philosophical journey of doubt and insecurity and where he ends up is knowing that the life he has is perfect. Why is the monster in your film more like a zombie flesh eater than the traditional Mummy? It's been branded with the crappy Hammer House of Horror idea and become part of this psyche of a guy who chases you at two miles an hour. You could have a glass of wine, dinner and brush your teeth before he'd even got to you. One of the reasons why this film was so successful and connected with people is because it created a very human monster, everything he did was for love. You've worked with Oxfam in campaigns against the arms trade. Are you doing any more campaign work against the weapons trade? Not at the moment, I still support it and certainly admire those who keep banging against the wall. \u0095 John Hannah is in The Mummy, now available to buy and rent on video.",

According to Stuhr, Kieslowski, whose Three Colours trilogy won him international acclaim, gave him the script in 1976 during a period when he wasn't thinking of making any more films. \u0095 Bruce Feirstein who wrote The World is not Enough and the previous three Bond pictures, is to script a remake of The Professionals, the tough 1966 Western about a wealthy ranch owner who hires a group of mercenaries to find the man who kidnapped his wife. Starring Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster the original film won three Oscar nominations.",

      "body": "<p>If, these days, you are a busy person, or a keenly-organised one, or a business executive who travels and likes gadgets, you may find yourself acquiring strange typing habits. Perhaps you only use your little fingers; or the edges of your fingertips; or a pen or a pencil, even, to peck more precisely at the keys. You probably type in public: on trains, at cafe tables, on streetcorners. You may feel nicely modern, bent over your personal organiser, great mineshafts of information and pulses of global communication beneath its slot of a screen. And just next to your tiny keyboard, the manufacturer's logo, most likely, will be an apparently unpronounceable word in yellow capitals: Psion. </p> <p>It sounds Californian - another anonymous-but-crucial Silicon Valley conglomerate, like Sun Microsystems or 3Com. Or maybe East Asian. When Psion (pronounced \"Sion\") commissioned research about its country of origin two year ago, most of its customers thought it was Japanese. But Psion is British. Its name stands for \"Potter Scientific Instruments Or Nothing\", its founder was a physics professor, and its history has been as charmed and erratic as any aficionado of these islands' famed inventiveness could hope for. What is more, in the great profitless deserts of British computing and innovation, Psion has actually made money. It could be about to make a great deal more. </p> <p>Since the early 80s, improbably at first but with steadily growing credibility, Psion has been selling an idea of the electronic future based on computers the size of pencil cases. While everyone else has been building faster, flasher machines, with features to please the nerds and prices to match, Psion has been producing far simpler, cheaper, more genuinely portable models. Until quite recently these were barely considered computers at all - a sort of electronic Filofax. On the business pages, Psion was praised, but modestly, as an \"innovative\" niche enterprise. </p> <p>Now, rather suddenly, it is being compared to Microsoft. And not just by over-excited financial journalists: in October 1998, Bill Gates himself \"leaked\" a Microsoft memo to the US media identifying Psion as his vast corporation's \"Number One Global Threat\". Since then, other computing and communications conglomerates have been queueing up to collaborate with Psion, like sixth-formers begging for a glimpse of the upcoming exam questions. On Tuesday, Motorola announced a joint manufacturing deal. Nokia, Ericsson, Oracle, and Matsushita, among others, have already joined a project started by Psion, called Symbian, to create the operating system for the next great advance in computing: fusion with the mobile phone. </p> <p>There are currently at least 380m mobile phones in the world. There are only 330m personal computers. Within two years, Nokia estimates, mobile phone numbers will have breached one billion. Day by day, it seems to be becoming clearer that people prefer their electronics small, cute, and pocketable - the way that Psion, more than anyone, has always built them - rather than desk-bound, boxy, and designed for offices. By next year, according to the publicist for Symbian, there will be \"30 or so\" mobile \"communicators\" or \"smartphones\" or \"wireless information devices\" for sale. They will combine telephone functions with email, internet access, and word processing. </p> <p>The publicist looks up from his laptop computer, where his presentation program is unfurling in a giddy whirl of rhetoric and dollar symbols. \"This is not a computing industry any more,\" he says, his smile suddenly gone. \"Consumers will not tolerate what they've lived with up to now.\" On the table, his slim new laptop, which is not a Psion, suddenly looks like a lump of stone. He purses his lips. \"I don't see this as an evolution.\" </p> <p>The company was more modest at the start. In 1980, after two decades teaching at Cambridge and Imperial College and the University of California, an expatriate white Zimbabwean with restless eyes and a love of London called David Potter decided to take a punt on computers. He was already a successful semi-professional investor, and had \u00a370,000 in spare profits. His curiosity had been stirred by the beginnings of Silicon Valley: \"A couple of my colleagues [in California] went off and built a mini-computer in 1974,\" Potter remembers. \"That impressed me hugely.\" </p> <p>He founded Psion as a software company, writing computer games. Across Britain, other people were inventing hungry hardware; early on, Psion provided software for some of the personal computers sold by Sir Clive Sinclair. And as most of the new computer firms began to fail, cut down by recession and naive marketing, Psion managed to prosper. \"We were very lucky,\" says Potter. \"We made huge profits very early on.\" He hung on to these windfalls to sustain Psion when things got worse. \"They made their own luck,\" says Sinclair. </p> <p>In 1984, Potter unveiled his first Organiser. It cost \u00a3100, and was little more than a computerised filing system, plus a calculator. But unlike the rival products that soon followed - such as the Microwriter and the Agenda, which asked users to learn an entirely new way of typing - it was practical. By the mid-80s, Psions were being used, very publicly, by British Rail staff and Marks &amp; Spencer. Potter the ex-academic, \"analytical by nature\", seemed to understand how to exploit novelty better than most entrepreneurs. \"If you look at the computer industry over 40 years,\" he says now, a professorial boom entering his voice, leaning back in one of the many chairs in his office at Psion's London headquarters, \"you get these disruptive transitions. Each time, the controllers of the technology, the high priests, lose power.\" A shark-like smile splits his long, tanned face. His eyes light with mischief. \"This is all solid-state physics, ultimately.\" </p> <p>In 1987, he confidently floated Psion on the Stock Exchange. Within a year, the share price had quadrupled; profits were surging up the graphs too. Two years later, both had collapsed. Psion, for all its cerebral self-awareness, had not yet learned a fairly obvious lesson about business: the more innovative a company is, the more it can suffer from its own \"disruptive transitions\". Each time Psion had a new product out, its customers would get excited and sales and profits would climb; but then, as the novelty eroded, and expectations about the next new gadget began to grow, people would stop buying and wait. In the meantime - which might be several years - Psion would be spending millions on research and development. The stock market, not known for its patience, would panic. At the memory, Potter's face abruptly tightens - from playful inventor to beleaguered pioneer. \"The major transition periods have been very difficult,\" he says. </p> <p>Currently, Psion is enduring another. As it makes promises about Symbian, and all its associated miracles of minaturisation and communication, so some of the items Psion sells now - its latest range of silvery slim Organizers, its standard software packages - already seem old-fashioned. On Tottenham Court Road, London's ceaselessly competitive electronics bazaar, Psion's recently-launched organiser for the younger, \"switched-on\" market, the Revo, has already been marked down from \u00a3300 to \u00a3260. </p> <p>Psion's shares have been lurching sharply up and down for months. The company website warns that \"On-going investment in Symbian will continue to constrain... short-term profitability.\" Senior Psion staff, some long-term, have been leaving in greater numbers of late than feels comfortable. Since 1996, Potter, who is 56, has suffered heart alarms and surgery. He has given up the day-to-day running of the company to become chairman. </p> <p>\"My role is more of a guiding one these days,\" he says. His office at Psion is on the top floor, facing away from the ferment of central London; a glass wall gives onto dozing Mayfair rooftops, a terrace, drifting clouds. \"In 1988, when we were about 120 people, I absolutely knew everyone,\" Potter continues. \"A larger organisation becomes more... process-driven.\" He has been acquiring projects outside Psion. He has recently been invited to Downing Street to give a lecture on entrepreneurship. He is a regular on education quangos. </p> <p>Meanwhile, across the corridor from his office, the new chief executive of Psion is plotting reform. David Levin is 20 years younger, a former management consultant, and has a background, not in electronics or new inventions, but in \"venture capital\" and \"abrasives\". He likes to whizz around his office on his chair castors. The view from his windows is of building sites, business premises being transformed or torn down. </p> <p>Levin wants to turn Psion from a deviser of gadgets into \"a platform for content\". He fixes his eager gaze: \"The category of organisers... is going to come to an end.\" The company needs to become more \"market-driven\", and less \"technology-driven\"; it must be \"nimble\", accept the need to \"reinvent\" itself. What all this means, in practical terms, remains a little unclear, for all Levin's chair-rolling and tumbling syllables. But he does mention one concrete initiative: he has sold off some of the company's factories. </p> <p>Such reinventions have not always suited Psion. In 1996, it tried to become a high-street favourite by buying Amstrad, the consumer electronics firm. The deal failed. The plans for Symbian are a similar gamble. The alliance could quickly raise Psion from a vigorous but commercially-vulnerable company of middling size to something much bigger and more stable. Potter and Levin anticipate receiving a large and constant income, via licence agreements, from the makers of the new devices that use Symbian software. Or the great collaboration could crumble. Some of Psion's current allies seem to be hedging their bets: last December, Motorola and Nokia became investors in the Palm Pilot, an American rival to the Psion Organiser; the same month, Ericsson announced a link-up with Microsoft to develop mobile email. </p> <p>Victor Basta, the managing director of Broadview, a consultancy specialising in the merger of computer firms, thinks this phoney war could last \"a year or two\". After that, as in many sorts of e-commerce, one or two conglomerates may be left standing. \"Psion's got a pretty good shot,\" he says. \"People have been saying Microsoft will kill them for a while now, and they haven't yet.\" </p> <p>High above Mayfair, behind his glass wall, Potter disagrees that such all-consuming competition will ever loom. \"No one company can manage the whole wireless future. You've got to be interdependent.\" He cites Europe's greater sophistication than the US, when it comes to mobile phones: in America, the network remains patchy and uncooperative because, he says, the telephone companies refuse to pool their resources. At board meetings for Symbian, by way of a contrast, Potter says he acts as \"the Kofi Annan\". </p> <p>It all sounds very civilised. That the electronic future might be partly constructed, not by some pale perpetual teenager from the cold school of capitalism, but by \"an old-fashioned liberal\" who \"believes in things\", and finds the time to advise the South African government, for example, on how to better educate poor people, is a reassuring notion. Perhaps we will all become more like Psion users: keen on our machines, more practical in our use of them, more resistant to pure marketing, a bit patriotic or political even in the brands we favour. </p> <p>There may be a few problems to sort out first, though. When the man from Symbian runs his demonstration program, the portable computer he shows is twice the likely actual size. Yet its screen is barely bigger than two matchboxes. He talks, quickly and a bit vaguely, about folding screens and putting the screen down the back and offering \"not internet, but internet-type content\". </p> <p>Sir Clive Sinclair knows about such difficulties. \"Whenever I'm at a meeting and we're deciding about dates,\" he says, \"the people with diaries are always 10 times faster. But the people with Psions get terribly cross if you say so.\"</p>",

Mr Blair was speaking at the Eden Project near St Austell, Cornwall, an environmental scheme which organisers hope will attract money into the region. Mr Blair's campaign to show Labour cares about the country follows the hostile reception given to the government's report earlier this week on rural life. The report recognised that income from farming had fallen by 60% since 1995 but said it had doubled in the previous five years. It pointed out that nearly 60% of farmers had other sources of income and the population of rural England had risen by nearly 25% in the last 25 years, four times the growth in the country as a whole. Most people regarded the quality of life as better in the countryside and two-thirds of people would move there if they could, the report said. Mr Blair's itinerary had been kept secret in order to avoid the protests which met his visit to Exeter yesterday. He later visited the post office and village store in Polgooth, Cornwall, run by Dawn and David Geeves for 14 years. Mr Geeves told the Prime Minister how vital social security payments had been to their business: \"People come in to get their benefit and allowances and then spend money in the shop.\" He said about 30 to 40% of his business was made up of paying benefit and allowances. Mr Blair said: \"So we are going to have to find another way to get people in. What we want to do is sit down with you guys and work out what we can do. \"We can't let rural post offices down. It's an important element in the community.\"",

      "byline": "Janine Gibson, Media Correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Proposals for a complete overhaul of the regulations governing broadcasting and telecommunications will be published this autumn, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, announced yesterday. </p> <p>The wide-ranging changes are being prepared in partnership with the department of trade and industry and aim to free up British media companies so that they can compete globally as the industry goes digital. </p> <p>Rules on programme content, the remit of public service broadcasting, and the laws restricting ownership of media companies will all be covered in the white paper.

      "bodyText": "Proposals for a complete overhaul of the regulations governing broadcasting and telecommunications will be published this autumn, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, announced yesterday. The wide-ranging changes are being prepared in partnership with the department of trade and industry and aim to free up British media companies so that they can compete globally as the industry goes digital. Rules on programme content, the remit of public service broadcasting, and the laws restricting ownership of media companies will all be covered in the white paper. The terrestrial broadcasters, including ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, have long argued for a relaxation of the detailed regulations which govern their programmes, and which currently force them to show a certain number of hours of arts, current affairs, children's and religious shows a week. Although Mr Smith has said he aims for a \"lighter touch\" regulation of television channels now that digital television has greatly increased the number of channels available, he insisted that viewers' and consumers' interests would be fully protected. He emphasised the importance of safeguarding children from unsuitable programmes and upholding the core public service duties of broadcasters. Mr Smith said yesterday that the white paper signalled the way forward for the consolidation of ITV. The companies which own most of the ITV network, Carlton Communications, United News and Media, and Granada Group, are already immersed in merger plans which most believe will inevitably lead to the creation of one ITV company if media legislation is changed. Mr Smith said that his consultation period and proposals for the white paper would run parallel to the ongoing investigations by the office of fair trading into the proposed ITV mergers. He confirmed he would be consulting broadcasters, regulators and viewers' interest groups, and warned the ITV companies that he felt the regional nature of the ITV companies should be protected. Reports that the prime minister has approved plans for a \u00a315 increase in the BBC's licence fee to cover the corporation's digital plans were \"complete nonsense\", he said. The across the board increase in the licence fee would be a turnround for the government, which has been investigating recommendations from the Davies committee to impose a supplementary fee on digital viewers. Broadcasters Sky Digital and ONdigital have vehemently opposed a supplement. Mr Smith said: \"No decision has yet been taken and we are still considering a range of options.\" An announcement is expected before the end of the month.",

It is coming under the hammer, along with other Withnail memorabilia, to help raise money for the Waterford School in Swaziland. Back in the 70s, Grant attended this multi-racial school for gifted children, along with Nelson Mandela's daughters, and he has organised the auction to follow a celebrity screening of the film. </p> <p>The coat was the creation of costume designer Andrea Galer, who wanted it to look as though it had come from the family attic. She based it on a 19th-century riding coat, to allow Grant ease of movement as he gallivanted around the countryside. \"When shooting fish, he had to be able to tie it up,\" she explains. \"Or in the scene where he rubs in Deep Heat, he had to push the sleeves up and make it look like an entirely usual activity.\" </p> <p>The result, in tweed lined with striped Indian silk dupion (\"Some hippie friend had decided to give it a lift into the 60s\") is suitably louche. \"Withnail needed to look decadent,\" Galer says. \"It's a coat that has a life.\" </p> <p>Over the years, she has fielded countless requests from Withnail fans who want to buy a replica. A couple of years ago, she produced a limited edition Withnail coat to mark the 10th anniversary of the film; today, you can buy a replica for the relatively bargain price of \u00a3295. </p> <p>Fashion and film have long been linked, but Galer pushes the relationship to its logical conclusion. A fashion, bridalwear and costume designer, she develops her film clothes into full-on fashion collections then made available to the public. Until a year ago, she had a shop in London's Belsize Park. \"It drove me nuts,\" she admits. Having all her samples stolen 18 months ago didn't help: \"It was very traumatic.\" </p> <p>These days, she takes the modern approach of putting her collections on the web. \"I can't understand why I didn't do it earlier,\" she enthuses, genuinely excited about the creative opportunities. \"You can have moving images, something to art-direct.\" </p> <p>Log on (<a href=\"http://www.andreagaler.co.uk)\">www.andreagaler.co.uk)</a> and you will find clothing inspired by Withnail, plus bridal and eveningwear from more recent film projects: Channel 4's Cinderella, shown on New Year's Day and starring Kathleen Turner, for which Galer created a look based on 50s couture; the new film version of Mansfield Park, which premiered at the London Film Festival and opens here next month; and the 1998 period drama Firelight. </p> <p> As well as the film collections, Galer produces women's suits and eveningwear. Based on corsetry and traditional tailoring, her look translates well into film: a model of cross-fertilisation, Galer's contemporary clothing influences her costume, which in turn has an impact on her main collections. Look at the rails of clothes in her Belsize Park studio and you can see how it works. A curvy bridal jacket, made up in a different fabric, shortened and tweaked, fits right into the world of Jane Austen. A raspberry empire-line dress, also designed for Mansfield Park, wouldn't look out of place in a ballroom today. \"That's a dress for now,\" Galer says, pointing at it with some satisfaction. </p> <p>When designing the costumes for something like Mansfield Park, she will research a period thoroughly, then alter the look slightly to appeal to the modern eye. A slip dress, for example, will be cut on the bias and slimmed down at the sides for a more contemporary look - in Jane Austen's day, women wanted to look slightly rounder than they do now. </p> <p>\"I'm sure that in a few years' time, you will be able to look back and see when a dress was made,\" Galer acknowledges. But, as she says: \"Stars want to look attractive. Everything looks better if it flatters somebody.\" </p> <p>Throughout her career, Galer has fused fashion and costume. She started out making theatrical outfits, which led to her dressing the likes of Julie Christie, as well as various pop stars of the 70s. It was through Christie that she received her first film commission, designing the costumes for Nicolas Roeg's 1973 movie Don't Look Now. After taking 10 years out to have children, Galer returned in the mid-80s, clothing the likes of Paul Young and Dire Straits for their videos. </p> <p>Then, of course, came Withnail. \"It's a bit like the Rocky Horror Show,\" Galer says, reflecting on its enduring appeal. \"I still find it funny.\" </p> <p>She already has her own outfit planned for Monday night's auction. She will be wearing a tailored coat from Savile Row, a Withnail scarf, a pair of jodhpurs from Cinderella and a shirt from Mansfield Park. Film and fashion don't get much more intertwined than that.</p>",

He said the number of admissions in January was something \"that any leisure attraction in the UK would cut off its right hand for\".</p> <p>Given the sluggish January tourist season, the Dome could have been expected to attract between 2.5% and 3% of its annual total in its first month and had, in fact, reached just over 3%.</p> <p>\"This, and the published polls on demand, show that the Dome remains on course to attract 12 million visitors in the year,\" said Mr Kane.</p> <p>The Dome could break even with 10 million admissions, the NMEC now calculates, if each visitor spent \u00a34 in retail outlets at the Dome, \u00a34 on eating and drinking and paid an average of just over \u00a313 for an admission ticket.</p> <p>Mr Kane said he expected business at the Dome to pick up along with other tourist attractions in the summer months with a further peak in the autumn as people rush to visit it before it closes.</p> <p>Dome organisers also took heart from a new Mori poll which showed that 82% of visitors were either very or fairly satisfied with their day out.</p> <p>However, only 16% of people said they would definitely return to visit the attraction again. In addition, 11% of visitors were either very or fairly dissatisfied with their visit and 19% thought the trip was either very poor or fairly poor in terms of value for money.</p> <p>The poll showed that residents of London and the south-east of England accounted for 55% of visitors, while overseas tourists accounted for 11%.

      "bodyText": "The Millennium Dome attracted 366,420 visitors in its first month, just 3% of the original break-even figure of 12 million for the whole of 2000. Dome organisers were anxious to put a positive spin on the figures, although the New Millennium Experience (NMEC) also confirmed it had applied to the Millennium Commission for an additional repayable grant of \"up to \u00a360 million\" to deal with a cash-flow shortage. It attributed the cash shortfall to sponsors failing to pay up as scheduled rather than the disappointing visitor figures, which included 21,800 schoolchildren on free visits and other non-paying guests. \"Not a bad result,\" was NMEC managing director Liam Kane's verdict. He said the number of admissions in January was something \"that any leisure attraction in the UK would cut off its right hand for\". Given the sluggish January tourist season, the Dome could have been expected to attract between 2.5% and 3% of its annual total in its first month and had, in fact, reached just over 3%. \"This, and the published polls on demand, show that the Dome remains on course to attract 12 million visitors in the year,\" said Mr Kane. The Dome could break even with 10 million admissions, the NMEC now calculates, if each visitor spent \u00a34 in retail outlets at the Dome, \u00a34 on eating and drinking and paid an average of just over \u00a313 for an admission ticket. Mr Kane said he expected business at the Dome to pick up along with other tourist attractions in the summer months with a further peak in the autumn as people rush to visit it before it closes. Dome organisers also took heart from a new Mori poll which showed that 82% of visitors were either very or fairly satisfied with their day out. However, only 16% of people said they would definitely return to visit the attraction again. In addition, 11% of visitors were either very or fairly dissatisfied with their visit and 19% thought the trip was either very poor or fairly poor in terms of value for money. The poll showed that residents of London and the south-east of England accounted for 55% of visitors, while overseas tourists accounted for 11%. Just 2% of visitors were from Wales, 2% from Northern Ireland and 7% from Scotland. Day by day at the Dome January 1 - 11,190 January 2 - 22,252 January 3 - 21,718 January 4 - 17,535 January 5 - 9,414 January 6 - 7,506 January 7 - 9,838 January 8 - 20,541 January 9 - 16,325 January 10 - 6,670 January 11 - 5,990 January 12 - 6,243 January 13 - 5,084 January 14 - 7,650 January 15 - 17,619 January 16 - 15,090 January 17 - 7,406 January 18 - 7,145 January 19 - 6,918 January 20 - 6,794 January 21 - 9,079 January 22 - 18,040 January 23 - 16,262 January 24 - 6,746 January 25 - 8,437 January 26 - 7,696 January 27 - 8,208 January 28 - 13,247 January 29 - 23,304 January 30 - 19,486 January 31 - 6,987",

      "body": "<p><strong>AW:</strong> You first started thinking about making an adaptation of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair seven or eight years ago. What led you to the script?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Because it was there. No, because I re-read it six years ago and I think everybody knows Graham Greene don't they, and everybody was acquainted when they were a child, or as an adolescent - I was. </p> <p>I re-read it about six years ago and I was struck by the fact that it is a most powerful book, and I was struck by the naked honesty of this portrayal of this need and this terribly damaged relationship, particularly the pitiless portrayal of Bendrix and his jealousy and his obsession and his need to repossess what he lost. </p> <p>And I also thought that there could perhaps be something cinematic at the heart of it - in the fact that at the heart of the events of the novel is a few pivotal scenes in the relationship between two people that is viewed in different ways, so it becomes a kaleidoscopic exploration of the same pivotal scenes and I thought that would be really interesting. I found Columbia had the rights to the novel and spoke to Stephen [Woolley] about it, we spoke to Columbia, they were very keen and I just kept thinking about it for a few years and finally I got down to writing a script.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> How long did that take?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> It didn't take long, about three or four weeks... but a lot of thinking!</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> That's fast!</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I write fast, but after thinking about it for a long while. But it was only when I began to write it I saw that there really is a film there. I started with the guy walking across the heath, and the meeting and walking into the house and those flashes of the relationship.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Did you look at the Edward Dmytryk film at all?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I didn't look at it until we were just about to make the film and then I got very depressed! [Laughter]. I'm not saying it's a bad film or anything, just that it's one of a kind of adaptations of novels they consistently made in those days and it alarmed me a little bit. Then I forgot about it and just went ahead.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Stephen, what role did you have as producer. Did you go to Columbia with a treatment from Neil?</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> No, Neil and I have made ten movies together and they've all been very different in terms of our relationship and how things have developed... Columbia had the rights because they had made the original 50s version and Neil wanted to do it. </p> <p>I loved the book, I thought the novel was fantastic, and just the idea of making a film in London. I've been very lucky in that I've been able to work here. London is the place where I was born and I really love material that's about the city and this was so much about London, it plays a second, or third, or fourth, or fifth character in this film so the thought of making this film, putting it together was exciting. </p> <p>Columbia asked me to produce it, partly because of our relationship. So that was really good and I was really pleased about that, really enjoyed it. But The Crying Game and Mona Lisa are things we've taken from a conversation, or something in a newspaper, this wasn't developed in that way. This was very much a studio picture to a certain extent and we were working with Columbia as a studio picture, not a high budget one, but a studio picture all the same which comes with all the good and bad things studio pictures come with, but they left us alone to be honest. </p> <p>I don't think we ever met a person from Columbia throughout the whole shoot which was nice and I think the stuff that Neil was turning out was so beautiful and the performances were so wonderful that they just said, \"Get on with it\", and I think we came in way under budget and it was a really good relationship which I have to say - with the films we made with Warner Bros as well - that's been the case. The three movies we made with Warner's and David Geffen and the film we made with DreamWorks were also studio free in terms of shooting them. We've worked together so long there is a trust people have in us.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Was there a green light to who you cast?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> There were a few names mentioned who were inappropriate.</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> It was really about, how much will the film cost you rather than you've got to cast X,Y, Z. And because Neil had quite a good track record with actors we felt that we would probably cast people that they would like - they trusted our take on that. I think that they would have been very disappointed if we had cast total unknowns, or cast inappropriately but we weren't really about to do that.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Ralph, at what stage did you talk to Neil about the project? Was it one of dozens of scripts you'd been sent speculatively? How did you get involved?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> It was quite a coincidence, because a couple of friends, independently of each other, had said, \"You should read The End of the Affair because if it's ever a film that's the part you might be interested in\". So I had actually bought it to read but had not read it and then coincidentally Neil sent me the screenplay so I sensed something fated about it. </p> <p>I read the book first because I had heard so much about it. I wanted to come to it not via a screenplay, and I read it and loved it and was very moved by it, and in fact the other Greene books that I had read I had loved and then thought the screenplay was a wonderful and truthful adaptation. </p> <p>I mean, I had some questions for Neil about the changes but I've actually come to understand that in adapting there is a necessary mutation that has to happen and in the hands of a director it seems that the director would be redundant if they were just going to replicate a novel scene by scene, they have to weave into their own vision and that's really how it come about. </p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> What were the challenges of adapting The End of the Affair? What I thought was how remarkably faithful it was to the spirit and the dramatic impact of the book, but were there any main challenges?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> The main challenge was its status as a piece of literature - that is kind of intimidating. I've got a theory that if something is finished as a piece of perfect work there is no point in trying to do anything with it. In this case I felt there was something to be done.

But the thing I've said about the love affair viewed from different perspectives and in particular I felt - and maybe people will disagree with me here - that towards the end of the novel there is a sense of Greene the novelist beginning to depart from it slightly, and I could feel Greene the philosophic obsessive beginning to take over and I felt the series of coincidences that were revealed about Sarah's death and the thing that led to her sainthood were slightly forced in a Hardy-esque way - you know the way Hardy would make his characters inevitably doomed - and I felt there was something for me to do there.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Even though you've changed the person to whom the miracle happens - from the priest to the boy - I thought it was extremely brave to go for the realisation of the miracle.</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Well, the book wouldn't exist without some relationship to some deity which Bendrix is fighting against and it wouldn't exist without some malignant force which is driving these characters towards a conclusion that they don't want.

And what I've done dramaturgically is kept Sarah alive longer ... </p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> ... and taken her to Brighton! [Laughter]</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I like Brighton. Brighton is a place where people used to go to get divorced and be snooped on in bed by a little private detective and that bit seemed right to me.

I just kept her alive longer.

Did you do much research on Graham Greene, were you trying to naturalise elements of Greene?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> I think when people talk about actors doing research it conjures up this image of someone travelling, poring over books, consuming information and in the end you can have a lot of knowledge but it doesn't help you act any better when someone says, \"Action\". </p> <p>But there is a case in every part to stimulate your imagination because I think that is a key tool for an actor, and clearly, in this case, the love affair in the book is based or inspired by Graham Greene's own love affair with Catherine Walston, but I really resist when people say it's clearly autobiography, I don't think it is, I think like every novelist he's taken something of his own experience and extended it, fictionalised it. </p> <p>It was useful to me read up about Graham Greene's life, to get a sense of his persona because I think some of his persona is in Bendrix and it was useful for me to read his love letters to Catherine Walston - or extracts from them - because they do reveal his neediness and his passion and his insecurity and his neuroses, and so putting bits of information together there is a picture of a man who didn't like to reveal his interior life to people, in fact went out of his way to put up smokescreens of information. </p> <p>At the same time, in his love-letters to Catherine there was incredibly direct expression of need and emotion and I think that all helps.

I liked that, that was a man in pain and I liked his anger, it was just something I responded to and his humour, too. There's a cruel irony in some of things he says and does and I liked it.

      "bodyText": "AW: You first started thinking about making an adaptation of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair seven or eight years ago. What led you to the script? NJ: Because it was there. No, because I re-read it six years ago and I think everybody knows Graham Greene don't they, and everybody was acquainted when they were a child, or as an adolescent - I was. I re-read it about six years ago and I was struck by the fact that it is a most powerful book, and I was struck by the naked honesty of this portrayal of this need and this terribly damaged relationship, particularly the pitiless portrayal of Bendrix and his jealousy and his obsession and his need to repossess what he lost. And I also thought that there could perhaps be something cinematic at the heart of it - in the fact that at the heart of the events of the novel is a few pivotal scenes in the relationship between two people that is viewed in different ways, so it becomes a kaleidoscopic exploration of the same pivotal scenes and I thought that would be really interesting. I found Columbia had the rights to the novel and spoke to Stephen [Woolley] about it, we spoke to Columbia, they were very keen and I just kept thinking about it for a few years and finally I got down to writing a script. AW: How long did that take? NJ: It didn't take long, about three or four weeks... but a lot of thinking! AW: That's fast! NJ: I write fast, but after thinking about it for a long while. But it was only when I began to write it I saw that there really is a film there. I started with the guy walking across the heath, and the meeting and walking into the house and those flashes of the relationship. AW: Did you look at the Edward Dmytryk film at all? NJ: I didn't look at it until we were just about to make the film and then I got very depressed! [Laughter]. I'm not saying it's a bad film or anything, just that it's one of a kind of adaptations of novels they consistently made in those days and it alarmed me a little bit. Then I forgot about it and just went ahead. AW: Stephen, what role did you have as producer. Did you go to Columbia with a treatment from Neil? SW: No, Neil and I have made ten movies together and they've all been very different in terms of our relationship and how things have developed... Columbia had the rights because they had made the original 50s version and Neil wanted to do it. I loved the book, I thought the novel was fantastic, and just the idea of making a film in London. I've been very lucky in that I've been able to work here. London is the place where I was born and I really love material that's about the city and this was so much about London, it plays a second, or third, or fourth, or fifth character in this film so the thought of making this film, putting it together was exciting. Columbia asked me to produce it, partly because of our relationship. So that was really good and I was really pleased about that, really enjoyed it. But The Crying Game and Mona Lisa are things we've taken from a conversation, or something in a newspaper, this wasn't developed in that way. This was very much a studio picture to a certain extent and we were working with Columbia as a studio picture, not a high budget one, but a studio picture all the same which comes with all the good and bad things studio pictures come with, but they left us alone to be honest. I don't think we ever met a person from Columbia throughout the whole shoot which was nice and I think the stuff that Neil was turning out was so beautiful and the performances were so wonderful that they just said, \"Get on with it\", and I think we came in way under budget and it was a really good relationship which I have to say - with the films we made with Warner Bros as well - that's been the case. The three movies we made with Warner's and David Geffen and the film we made with DreamWorks were also studio free in terms of shooting them. We've worked together so long there is a trust people have in us. AW: Was there a green light to who you cast? NJ: There were a few names mentioned who were inappropriate. SW: It was really about, how much will the film cost you rather than you've got to cast X,Y, Z. And because Neil had quite a good track record with actors we felt that we would probably cast people that they would like - they trusted our take on that. I think that they would have been very disappointed if we had cast total unknowns, or cast inappropriately but we weren't really about to do that. AW: Ralph, at what stage did you talk to Neil about the project? Was it one of dozens of scripts you'd been sent speculatively? How did you get involved? RF: It was quite a coincidence, because a couple of friends, independently of each other, had said, \"You should read The End of the Affair because if it's ever a film that's the part you might be interested in\". So I had actually bought it to read but had not read it and then coincidentally Neil sent me the screenplay so I sensed something fated about it. I read the book first because I had heard so much about it. I wanted to come to it not via a screenplay, and I read it and loved it and was very moved by it, and in fact the other Greene books that I had read I had loved and then thought the screenplay was a wonderful and truthful adaptation. I mean, I had some questions for Neil about the changes but I've actually come to understand that in adapting there is a necessary mutation that has to happen and in the hands of a director it seems that the director would be redundant if they were just going to replicate a novel scene by scene, they have to weave into their own vision and that's really how it come about. AW: What were the challenges of adapting The End of the Affair? What I thought was how remarkably faithful it was to the spirit and the dramatic impact of the book, but were there any main challenges? NJ: The main challenge was its status as a piece of literature - that is kind of intimidating. I've got a theory that if something is finished as a piece of perfect work there is no point in trying to do anything with it. In this case I felt there was something to be done. There was something valid I could do to make it a movie, and it was partly the incredible ironic cleverness of the story, the way Maurice and Henry meet and have this conversation about an unknown lover, without Henry knowing that [Maurice] Bendrix is in fact the lover. There are multiple ironies that begin even there. But the thing I've said about the love affair viewed from different perspectives and in particular I felt - and maybe people will disagree with me here - that towards the end of the novel there is a sense of Greene the novelist beginning to depart from it slightly, and I could feel Greene the philosophic obsessive beginning to take over and I felt the series of coincidences that were revealed about Sarah's death and the thing that led to her sainthood were slightly forced in a Hardy-esque way - you know the way Hardy would make his characters inevitably doomed - and I felt there was something for me to do there. AW: Even though you've changed the person to whom the miracle happens - from the priest to the boy - I thought it was extremely brave to go for the realisation of the miracle. NJ: Well, the book wouldn't exist without some relationship to some deity which Bendrix is fighting against and it wouldn't exist without some malignant force which is driving these characters towards a conclusion that they don't want. I was just re-reading it tonight actually because I was anticipating people saying, \"Why did you do this\" \"Why did you do that?\" [Laughter]. And what I've done dramaturgically is kept Sarah alive longer ... AW: ... and taken her to Brighton! [Laughter] NJ: I like Brighton. Brighton is a place where people used to go to get divorced and be snooped on in bed by a little private detective and that bit seemed right to me. But more importantly in the book after Sarah dies - she's cut down with a scythe, a novelist's impatience I think in a way: he writes her out with a stroke of a pen, \"I'm terribly sorry, Sarah's dead\". He goes to Henry's house and he finds a letter from her that she sent to him, so the speech that she gives to Bendrix at the end when she is dying, the essence of her letter is there, so I think I've been truthful to the emotional movements of Greene's book. I just kept her alive longer. And the character Smythe, I never thought was successful - the rationalist preacher who gets this sudden kind of overwhelming conversion, I never thought this character was very successful. Those are my opinions and other people can disagree but that's why I did what I did. AW: In interviews Greene later said that he regretted putting the miracle in the book at all. NJ: Well, I thought that if a strawberry mark is removed from a 42-year-old atheist and he suddenly says, \"Oh my God, I believe, I believe\" like St Paul, I have to be a bloody believer to believe that, I have to take issue with the idea of faith to believe that. But I think those things do happen to adolescent kids, they go through changes in their lives, they're powerfully affected by emotional encounters and I just thought it was more ambiguous on a boy. AW: How did you approach the character of Bendrix? Did you do much research on Graham Greene, were you trying to naturalise elements of Greene? RF: I think when people talk about actors doing research it conjures up this image of someone travelling, poring over books, consuming information and in the end you can have a lot of knowledge but it doesn't help you act any better when someone says, \"Action\". But there is a case in every part to stimulate your imagination because I think that is a key tool for an actor, and clearly, in this case, the love affair in the book is based or inspired by Graham Greene's own love affair with Catherine Walston, but I really resist when people say it's clearly autobiography, I don't think it is, I think like every novelist he's taken something of his own experience and extended it, fictionalised it. It was useful to me read up about Graham Greene's life, to get a sense of his persona because I think some of his persona is in Bendrix and it was useful for me to read his love letters to Catherine Walston - or extracts from them - because they do reveal his neediness and his passion and his insecurity and his neuroses, and so putting bits of information together there is a picture of a man who didn't like to reveal his interior life to people, in fact went out of his way to put up smokescreens of information. At the same time, in his love-letters to Catherine there was incredibly direct expression of need and emotion and I think that all helps.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>AW:</strong> Stephen, the film started shooting in February 1999 and it was finished by the end of the year, you'd shot it, done all the post-production... </p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> We delivered it in October I think. <br><br><strong>AW:</strong> This is very fast, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> I hate to sound like a film producer but it was a fantastic shoot. I think Ralph and Julianne and Stephen [Rea] and Ian [Hart] and our crew just got on like a house on fire. We all loved the work, everybody supported Neil in every way, we supported the actors any way we could. </p> <p>It was an incredibly intelligently-made film in that there were no egos, no tantrums, it was very much that we wanted to get the best work that we could on screen, so the shoot went incredibly well - I mean there were problems and there were crises and panic, crisis-management things you have to get involved in but everybody did it in a really level-headed adult way - that's unusual for films. </p> <p>Film-makers generally don't act like adults, they act like spoilt brats [laughter] and that includes everyone. On a film you can have a props person who will drive you completely crazy because of their antics and they can affect the whole unit. One person plays games and suddenly everyone's into it. </p> <p>We just lucked-out with an A-team on every front and that is unusual. We shot the film quickly with a great deal of ease. Of course when you finally see the piece there are changes that have to be made because some things work splendidly, some things don't work so well but it was a real joy and a really easy, fluid experience and I think that's why we managed to deliver it so quickly.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> You surprised me when you said the film came in under budget because it looks like an expensive movie... </p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> There are two ways to shoot a film. One way is where you shoot a lot of stuff with a lot of energy and fire a lot of squibs off in the dark and you make the film and you edit it - that takes a long time. The other way is to decide what the film should be like before you shoot it and that takes a shorter time and I prefer the second way! </p> <p>But we confined it, we didn't try to turn the book into a wider, more epic, more sweeping portrait of London, or of the Blitz, or of the war, if anything we reduced it. Our energies did go into making this city and the wider experience of London to be an enabler to their relationship, the war was just seen through their bedroom.</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> We didn't make a feature about the war, that was the important thing. It was as if that was going on so when the bomb actually comes it's actually quite shocking, it should be the moment when people jump out of their seats because it's so unexpected, given that although you do see war-torn London you don't really ever come to grips with the inherent violence. </p> <p>During the love-making scenes when the bombs are dropping you feel it's not going to drop on the house. We used the locations very, very carefully and the atmosphere of claustrophobia that is there within the characters' relationships and the secretiveness is also there in those beautiful rain-filled scenes and moments where you feel things are encroaching on you. <strong>AW:</strong> Did you have a lot of rehearsals?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> We had a week. [Laughter]</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Is that a long time, Ralph?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> For films that is quite long. I think two, three weeks is very generous on a film and very often there is no rehearsal. I think a week is good - ish. [Laughter]</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> We used the rehearsal because there was a script, there was me as director, there were the actors and there was the novel. I would say I used it selfishly because there were certain elements in the characters or in the characterisation or in the overall meaning of where the characters were going that could perhaps have been highlighted, or perhaps were underdeveloped in what I had written. </p> <p>There was one scene in particular that I had written where Bendrix and Henry have a ferocious confrontation in Brighton and Ralph's instinct very strongly was that he would not shout at Henry and he said, \"Look at the book again\" and the character he does shout at is the priest. And I looked at that scene again and I rewrote that last scene and that's the thing that comes out of working closely with people who are really committed to their craft, and are approaching the subject with huge intelligence. [Pushes Ralph playfully]. </p> <p>No, I'm serious and there was another scene - the scene with the biscuits - where he apologises to Henry, those two things came out of conversations with the actors and there's other little bits I added when I felt things were missing.</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Those rehearsals were useful because you were open to suggestions about the dialogue. It may sound odd, but it's quite good not to rehearse for a film in the terms of \"giving a performance\" in the rehearsal room, because unlike the theatre I think that those moments that are unexpected and surprise even the actor themselves have to be protected.</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> They have to be avoided really until you begin. [Laughter] Otherwise you never find them. A point does come when I see the performance beginning and I get terrified, I say, \"Let's stop now please\" because I don't want to see that and I don't think the actor wants to see it either. Film is a different thing than theatre; I'd love to do it for theatre sometime to see what that was like.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Did you use storyboards?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> No, well for huge scenes like that bomb. Everyone has to know how high that window has to be so they can blow it up. A stuntman has to do an incredibly dangerous fall through three stories of a building, stuff like that you need to storyboard, and the explosion in the park where the doodlebug falls, but that's very basic stuff. </p> <p>I don't know how you could storyboard a film like this, I think it would be rather silly. It is about performance and it's about atmosphere and it's about creating the haunted context within which these steamy emotions can exist.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Ralph, do you agree with Neil here?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> I'm in complete agreement, that's what I was just trying to say. This week of so-called rehearsal is more a discussion and just simply reading with no indication of any interpretation, just reading it to get a sense of how it plays and I think you don't want to shoot your bolt before you've got a camera turning. Steven Spielberg didn't do a single rehearsal at all on Schindler's List - not one for that reason. He would be shooting rehearsals in case something happened. <strong>AW:</strong> What does that mean for your relationship with Julianne Moore, because The End of the Affair is such an intense love story... </p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Lots of drinks [Laughter]. People say so-and-so and so-and-so have great chemistry but actors can't act chemistry. I think it's luck in a way if there's some kind of trust. Actually, I think Julianne and I found a shared sense of humour a lot of the time, especially during these love-making scenes because it is frightening and it is quite absurd isn't it - to create this very intimate thing with all these cameras around and lights and people holding things and everyone shuffling and looking very serious [laughter] and looking at their stopwatches and scratching their heads and Neil says \"Action\" and then you do it. </p> <p>You do IT and then he says \"Cut\" and you stop IT. It's funny, it's absurd. You have to have a sense of humour and I think the humour makes you trust each other and from that relief that you can laugh, it's not so terrible, it's not so embarrassing, and then I think you can just get on and do it.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> On screen you and Ian Hart are a great double-act, but Parkis is a difficult character because it would be easy to make him a stereotype... </p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I think Parkis is a great character. He's a great character in the book and he's got - and this is how good Greene was because he's so specific as a novelist - he's got almost Parkis-speak hasn't he? As I was writing this I could adopt this mode of speech, it was almost Mr Gradgrind from Hard Times: \"The party in question did this, the party in question did that\". The particular way he'd use important legal-sounding words and stuff like that. And Ian is a very interesting actor.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Let's talk about Stephen Rea for a moment because he's a bit of a talisman for you. His role struck me as one of the most difficult roles in the film - to be convincing.</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Yes, it's probably the most difficult part in a way because how do you portray a good human being, particularly when that human has nothing to do? First of all you're demanding that an actor be passive, you're also demanding he be uninteresting. But I had a conception and I think Henry is different in the film than he is in the novel. </p> <p>I think Greene was quite witheringly cruel to Harry Walston, that was a piece of real life that was in there. When Stephen spoke to me about the role first he said \"This man is a dreary little cuckold, what can I make of this guy?\" I thought it had to express the goodness of the ordinary person, the goodness of the non-dramatic human being, and as I began to talk about this with Stephen I could see he got interested and I was lucky I had a relationship which went over several movies so that I could persuade him to take a part which he had initially rejected. But those sort of parts need enormous subtlety and there's an enormous attractiveness to those parts. <strong>AW:</strong> Stephen, tell us about how The End of the Affair got its controversial 18 rating?</p> <p><strong>SW: </strong>The film was shown to the MPAA in America - the US equivalent to the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) here - and they gave it, on a technicality - the two love-making scenes - an NC-17 which means no-one can come unless they are 17+ under any circumstances. We resubmitted the film and said, \"Please could you get more people to see it because we don't believe that the way this film's going to be released, the kind of audience that are going to see this picture, are going to be shocked and they in fact are going to be put off by that kind of certification because it would suggest that it's not an adaptation of the book at all, but something that's been modernised or changed or perverted\". </p> <p>So they looked at it again and said, \"You're right, it's an art film and technically yes those two scenes are a little close to the edge but given the context of the film we'll give you an R\". And an R means that anyone can see the film accompanied by an adult, anyone over 17 can see the picture, anyone under 17 can see the picture if they're accompanied by someone over 17. So then the film was shown to the Irish censor who immediately gave the film 15 with no questions asked. </p> <p>Then we showed it to the BBFC and they came back to us and said, \"It's an 18 because you have two scenes and there's a little too much movement from Ralph in one scene [Laughter] and the positioning of that shot is too long\". And I said, \"Could you please get Robin Duval, the director of the BBFC, to see it because I really think that if he sees the picture he'll realise that this film isn't an 18\". </p> <p>I mean, there isn't going to be a lot of 16-year-olds who are going to be clamouring for this picture anyway, it's just that I didn't want to send out the wrong signals because a lot of people who will see The End of the Affair are, I hope, people who perhaps don't go to the cinema very often. I mean my mother-in-law and her mother who's 92 came to see the picture and just adored it because they're big Graham Greene fans, they don't go to the movies that much, when you're 92 you don't rush out every weekend to see a movie [Laughter]. </p> <p>But she came to the movie and just loved it and was bowled over. But when she and her friends get together to hire videos or they go to the movies they'll think, \"Oh that's going to be like those terrible Scream movies, or it's violent and sexual and they'll be lots of swearing. The closest this film gets to swearing is when Ralph says, \"She's a tart to your mumbo-jumbo\", that's as hardcore as it gets. </p> <p>The violence happens more or less off-screen, it's just those two scenes. The irony of this is that the censors said, \"We don't want you to cut those scenes for a 15. We think it might harm the integrity of the movie. We don't want to be seen harming the integrity of the movie, but we'll give you an 18. It was just sending out mixed messages. And that weekend I immediately looking at other films with certification and I noticed that the Peter Greenaway film 8* Women got a 15. </p> <p>I started looking at the reviews for that film and realised that it was probably the worst reviewed film of last year and particularly as it was reviewed as being a very sexist and nasty portrayal of women. I saw the film and it was pretty shocking. And then I noticed that the James Bond film got a 12 which is essentially a catalogue of murder and mayhem and people garrotted and blown up every two minutes. </p> <p>It just seemed rather ludicrous that The End of the Affair... I want people to tell me it should have an 18 certificate because any 16-17-year-old teenager would, I think, benefit from seeing the movie if they stayed the course. Most 16-17-year-olds are going to see the Bond film but if anyone wants to see this movie I think they should be applauded for wanting to see it, not banned. </p> <p>I mean a 17-year-old woman can do anything, and a man can as well, but they can't see The End of the Affair?! It's really, really shocking and I thought they would come back and say, \"We're kidding\" [Laughter]. It's like being on Death Row, any minute now the governors are going to come in with your pardon but they haven't come back with a pardon so we're releasing with an 18 and I do think that it will discriminate what will happen to the film because we would of course never cut it. </p> <p>What will happen is that a certain audience out there, who would have loved the novel perhaps, who only go to the cinema a few times a year will be put off seeing this movie because people of a certain generation do not see films which have 18 certificates. It is worrying to me and if there is someone here who could explain to me that it's a good decision I'd like to hear it. <strong>AW:</strong> Why did you employ Michael Nyman to write the score?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> He's got tremendous simplicity, he's written some extraordinarily great music. To return to Peter Greenaway, when I saw The Draftsman's Contract... Peter cut the movie to Michael's music because the bar changes happened on the cuts and it's really thrilling to see that merger. I loved what he did in The Piano. I wanted a score for this which was quite restrained and English, definitely. I met with Michael several times, we discussed it and he just went for it really.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Why did you choose a composer instead of selecting a source, because it would have been quite easy with that period?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Well, it's weird. If you take the music from that period, Charlie Parker was playing, Benjamin Britten was composing, I think Ravel was still alive and obviously Gracie Fields was singing and George Formby was twinkling away. There's a huge range to choose from in that period but Michael came up with something beautiful and incredibly melodic which I loved. It expressed a sense of loss from the word go.</p>",

      "bodyText": "AW: Stephen, the film started shooting in February 1999 and it was finished by the end of the year, you'd shot it, done all the post-production... SW: We delivered it in October I think. AW: This is very fast, isn't it? SW: I hate to sound like a film producer but it was a fantastic shoot. I think Ralph and Julianne and Stephen [Rea] and Ian [Hart] and our crew just got on like a house on fire. We all loved the work, everybody supported Neil in every way, we supported the actors any way we could. It was an incredibly intelligently-made film in that there were no egos, no tantrums, it was very much that we wanted to get the best work that we could on screen, so the shoot went incredibly well - I mean there were problems and there were crises and panic, crisis-management things you have to get involved in but everybody did it in a really level-headed adult way - that's unusual for films. Film-makers generally don't act like adults, they act like spoilt brats [laughter] and that includes everyone. On a film you can have a props person who will drive you completely crazy because of their antics and they can affect the whole unit. One person plays games and suddenly everyone's into it. We just lucked-out with an A-team on every front and that is unusual. We shot the film quickly with a great deal of ease. Of course when you finally see the piece there are changes that have to be made because some things work splendidly, some things don't work so well but it was a real joy and a really easy, fluid experience and I think that's why we managed to deliver it so quickly. AW: You surprised me when you said the film came in under budget because it looks like an expensive movie... NJ: There are two ways to shoot a film. One way is where you shoot a lot of stuff with a lot of energy and fire a lot of squibs off in the dark and you make the film and you edit it - that takes a long time. The other way is to decide what the film should be like before you shoot it and that takes a shorter time and I prefer the second way! But we confined it, we didn't try to turn the book into a wider, more epic, more sweeping portrait of London, or of the Blitz, or of the war, if anything we reduced it. Our energies did go into making this city and the wider experience of London to be an enabler to their relationship, the war was just seen through their bedroom. SW: We didn't make a feature about the war, that was the important thing. It was as if that was going on so when the bomb actually comes it's actually quite shocking, it should be the moment when people jump out of their seats because it's so unexpected, given that although you do see war-torn London you don't really ever come to grips with the inherent violence. During the love-making scenes when the bombs are dropping you feel it's not going to drop on the house. We used the locations very, very carefully and the atmosphere of claustrophobia that is there within the characters' relationships and the secretiveness is also there in those beautiful rain-filled scenes and moments where you feel things are encroaching on you. AW: Did you have a lot of rehearsals? NJ: We had a week. [Laughter] AW: Is that a long time, Ralph? RF: For films that is quite long. I think two, three weeks is very generous on a film and very often there is no rehearsal. I think a week is good - ish. [Laughter] NJ: We used the rehearsal because there was a script, there was me as director, there were the actors and there was the novel. I would say I used it selfishly because there were certain elements in the characters or in the characterisation or in the overall meaning of where the characters were going that could perhaps have been highlighted, or perhaps were underdeveloped in what I had written. There was one scene in particular that I had written where Bendrix and Henry have a ferocious confrontation in Brighton and Ralph's instinct very strongly was that he would not shout at Henry and he said, \"Look at the book again\" and the character he does shout at is the priest. And I looked at that scene again and I rewrote that last scene and that's the thing that comes out of working closely with people who are really committed to their craft, and are approaching the subject with huge intelligence. [Pushes Ralph playfully]. No, I'm serious and there was another scene - the scene with the biscuits - where he apologises to Henry, those two things came out of conversations with the actors and there's other little bits I added when I felt things were missing. RF: Those rehearsals were useful because you were open to suggestions about the dialogue. It may sound odd, but it's quite good not to rehearse for a film in the terms of \"giving a performance\" in the rehearsal room, because unlike the theatre I think that those moments that are unexpected and surprise even the actor themselves have to be protected. NJ: They have to be avoided really until you begin. [Laughter] Otherwise you never find them. A point does come when I see the performance beginning and I get terrified, I say, \"Let's stop now please\" because I don't want to see that and I don't think the actor wants to see it either. Film is a different thing than theatre; I'd love to do it for theatre sometime to see what that was like. AW: Did you use storyboards? NJ: No, well for huge scenes like that bomb. Everyone has to know how high that window has to be so they can blow it up. A stuntman has to do an incredibly dangerous fall through three stories of a building, stuff like that you need to storyboard, and the explosion in the park where the doodlebug falls, but that's very basic stuff. I don't know how you could storyboard a film like this, I think it would be rather silly. It is about performance and it's about atmosphere and it's about creating the haunted context within which these steamy emotions can exist. AW: Ralph, do you agree with Neil here? RF: I'm in complete agreement, that's what I was just trying to say. This week of so-called rehearsal is more a discussion and just simply reading with no indication of any interpretation, just reading it to get a sense of how it plays and I think you don't want to shoot your bolt before you've got a camera turning. Steven Spielberg didn't do a single rehearsal at all on Schindler's List - not one for that reason. He would be shooting rehearsals in case something happened. AW: What does that mean for your relationship with Julianne Moore, because The End of the Affair is such an intense love story... RF: Lots of drinks [Laughter]. People say so-and-so and so-and-so have great chemistry but actors can't act chemistry. I think it's luck in a way if there's some kind of trust. Actually, I think Julianne and I found a shared sense of humour a lot of the time, especially during these love-making scenes because it is frightening and it is quite absurd isn't it - to create this very intimate thing with all these cameras around and lights and people holding things and everyone shuffling and looking very serious [laughter] and looking at their stopwatches and scratching their heads and Neil says \"Action\" and then you do it. You do IT and then he says \"Cut\" and you stop IT. It's funny, it's absurd. You have to have a sense of humour and I think the humour makes you trust each other and from that relief that you can laugh, it's not so terrible, it's not so embarrassing, and then I think you can just get on and do it. AW: On screen you and Ian Hart are a great double-act, but Parkis is a difficult character because it would be easy to make him a stereotype... NJ: I think Parkis is a great character. He's a great character in the book and he's got - and this is how good Greene was because he's so specific as a novelist - he's got almost Parkis-speak hasn't he? As I was writing this I could adopt this mode of speech, it was almost Mr Gradgrind from Hard Times: \"The party in question did this, the party in question did that\". The particular way he'd use important legal-sounding words and stuff like that. And Ian is a very interesting actor. AW: Let's talk about Stephen Rea for a moment because he's a bit of a talisman for you. His role struck me as one of the most difficult roles in the film - to be convincing. NJ: Yes, it's probably the most difficult part in a way because how do you portray a good human being, particularly when that human has nothing to do? First of all you're demanding that an actor be passive, you're also demanding he be uninteresting. But I had a conception and I think Henry is different in the film than he is in the novel. I think Greene was quite witheringly cruel to Harry Walston, that was a piece of real life that was in there. When Stephen spoke to me about the role first he said \"This man is a dreary little cuckold, what can I make of this guy?\" I thought it had to express the goodness of the ordinary person, the goodness of the non-dramatic human being, and as I began to talk about this with Stephen I could see he got interested and I was lucky I had a relationship which went over several movies so that I could persuade him to take a part which he had initially rejected. But those sort of parts need enormous subtlety and there's an enormous attractiveness to those parts. AW: Stephen, tell us about how The End of the Affair got its controversial 18 rating? SW: The film was shown to the MPAA in America - the US equivalent to the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) here - and they gave it, on a technicality - the two love-making scenes - an NC-17 which means no-one can come unless they are 17+ under any circumstances. We resubmitted the film and said, \"Please could you get more people to see it because we don't believe that the way this film's going to be released, the kind of audience that are going to see this picture, are going to be shocked and they in fact are going to be put off by that kind of certification because it would suggest that it's not an adaptation of the book at all, but something that's been modernised or changed or perverted\". So they looked at it again and said, \"You're right, it's an art film and technically yes those two scenes are a little close to the edge but given the context of the film we'll give you an R\". And an R means that anyone can see the film accompanied by an adult, anyone over 17 can see the picture, anyone under 17 can see the picture if they're accompanied by someone over 17. So then the film was shown to the Irish censor who immediately gave the film 15 with no questions asked.

I mean, there isn't going to be a lot of 16-year-olds who are going to be clamouring for this picture anyway, it's just that I didn't want to send out the wrong signals because a lot of people who will see The End of the Affair are, I hope, people who perhaps don't go to the cinema very often.

As a result cabinet ministers are pitched against US secretaries of state rowing over the timing of various airport slots. </p> <p>Details of these talks - down to even John Prescott's scrawled notes - are banned from publication until 2030 by Jack Straw's freedom of information bill, now going through parliament. But Mr Prescott's personal correspondence has been released to the Guardian under US law less than two years after he wrote them. </p> <p>They show an irritable and stubborn Mr Prescott pitched against an equally aggressive Rodney Slater, the US transportation secretary - a working-class buddy of Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The letters reveal that Mr Prescott was ready to block any progress on Britain's official policy for an \"open skies\" agreement with the US until BA got what it wanted. </p> <p><strong> Privy talks</strong><br> </p> <p>The process begins with an aggressive letter in April 1998 from Mr Slater expressing \"extreme disappointment\" that Mr Prescott has not granted US Airways a Gatwick slot for a Charlotte service. </p> <p>By June, Mr Prescott is writing back saying US Airways should get their slot but complaining equally forcefully that BA should be allowed to start its Denver service. \"I would be most grateful if you could now authorise the immediate commencement of the BA Denver service and dismiss the complaint against the UK made under the international air transportation fair competitive practices act. As soon as this is accomplished I will lift the prohibition on Charlotte services for the remainder of summer 1998. I would be happy to discuss this on the telephone if you wish. \" </p> <p>On July 22, Mr Prescott writes again: \"I remain very concerned that the commencement of BA's service to Denver is being held by your department. </p> <p>\"Quite apart from the detriment to a UK airline and to consumers generally this is not creating the right environment for the development of our bilateral air services relationship.\" </p> <p>Mr Prescott offers to restart the open skies debate if the Americans kick-start transatlantic flights. \"May I please urge you to act now to authorise the Denver service so that we can turn to other, wider issues?\" He adds in his own scrawl: \"Why did you not ring back?\" </p> <p>Despite the spat a little over five months months later US Airways has secured a slot for Charlotte and BA has been started its Denver service. </p> <p>Open skies talks opened, but crashed earlier this week. </p> <p>What the letters also reveal is that the US decision to put forward United's name for Heathrow angered UK airlines and ruffled legal feathers in London. Mr Prescott noted: \"Legal opinions on this designation have been exchanged at official level already and, while the UK does not share the US interpretation of Bermuda II [the Anglo-US agreement] on the question ... I have decided in this case to approve the application.\" </p> <p>But Mr Prescott's action was not approved of in the industry. \"Both the UK's major long-haul airlines are unhappy about this decision. I recognise that under the US interpretation ... Virgin could transfer its Boston service to Heathrow but understand Virgin is unable to secure viable slots at Heathrow for the service, unlike United.\" </p> <p>Despite Mr Prescott's intervention, Virgin did not get a Heathrow-Boston service. Officials say Mr Prescott was \"concerned that the slot problems experienced by some US carriers had the potential to spill over into the wider relationship and could have caused harm to BA and Virgin's US operations.\" </p> <p>Officials say that Mr Prescott's decision to allow United to get access to Heathrow was \"pragmatic\"but add that Virgin did not support it. Virgin, they say, did get Mr Prescott's support to run a new service to Chicago later. That may be a small victory for Mr Prescott but he is unlikely to achieve many more. </p> <p>Congressmen are now calling for Concorde to be banned from the US and for permits for British airlines to be withdrawn. \"It's time to get tough and send a message to the Brits,\" said Mr Shuster.</p>",

As a result cabinet ministers are pitched against US secretaries of state rowing over the timing of various airport slots. Details of these talks - down to even John Prescott's scrawled notes - are banned from publication until 2030 by Jack Straw's freedom of information bill, now going through parliament. But Mr Prescott's personal correspondence has been released to the Guardian under US law less than two years after he wrote them. They show an irritable and stubborn Mr Prescott pitched against an equally aggressive Rodney Slater, the US transportation secretary - a working-class buddy of Bill Clinton. The letters reveal that Mr Prescott was ready to block any progress on Britain's official policy for an \"open skies\" agreement with the US until BA got what it wanted. Privy talks The process begins with an aggressive letter in April 1998 from Mr Slater expressing \"extreme disappointment\" that Mr Prescott has not granted US Airways a Gatwick slot for a Charlotte service. By June, Mr Prescott is writing back saying US Airways should get their slot but complaining equally forcefully that BA should be allowed to start its Denver service. \"I would be most grateful if you could now authorise the immediate commencement of the BA Denver service and dismiss the complaint against the UK made under the international air transportation fair competitive practices act. As soon as this is accomplished I will lift the prohibition on Charlotte services for the remainder of summer 1998. I would be happy to discuss this on the telephone if you wish. \" On July 22, Mr Prescott writes again: \"I remain very concerned that the commencement of BA's service to Denver is being held by your department. \"Quite apart from the detriment to a UK airline and to consumers generally this is not creating the right environment for the development of our bilateral air services relationship.\" Mr Prescott offers to restart the open skies debate if the Americans kick-start transatlantic flights. \"May I please urge you to act now to authorise the Denver service so that we can turn to other, wider issues?\" He adds in his own scrawl: \"Why did you not ring back?\" Despite the spat a little over five months months later US Airways has secured a slot for Charlotte and BA has been started its Denver service. Open skies talks opened, but crashed earlier this week. What the letters also reveal is that the US decision to put forward United's name for Heathrow angered UK airlines and ruffled legal feathers in London. Mr Prescott noted: \"Legal opinions on this designation have been exchanged at official level already and, while the UK does not share the US interpretation of Bermuda II [the Anglo-US agreement] on the question ... I have decided in this case to approve the application.\" But Mr Prescott's action was not approved of in the industry. \"Both the UK's major long-haul airlines are unhappy about this decision. I recognise that under the US interpretation ... Virgin could transfer its Boston service to Heathrow but understand Virgin is unable to secure viable slots at Heathrow for the service, unlike United.\" Despite Mr Prescott's intervention, Virgin did not get a Heathrow-Boston service. Officials say Mr Prescott was \"concerned that the slot problems experienced by some US carriers had the potential to spill over into the wider relationship and could have caused harm to BA and Virgin's US operations.\" Officials say that Mr Prescott's decision to allow United to get access to Heathrow was \"pragmatic\"but add that Virgin did not support it. Virgin, they say, did get Mr Prescott's support to run a new service to Chicago later. That may be a small victory for Mr Prescott but he is unlikely to achieve many more. Congressmen are now calling for Concorde to be banned from the US and for permits for British airlines to be withdrawn. \"It's time to get tough and send a message to the Brits,\" said Mr Shuster.",

Stephen King, his body and confidence crushed by a runaway van, is storming back from the brink of retirement with what is said to be the most valuable literary contract in history. He has signed a three-book deal rumoured to be worth \u00a330m. The sum shatters previous records and turns the author of Carrie, The Shining and Misery into the colossus of commercial fiction. King's British publisher, Hodder and Stoughton, yesterday confirmed their biggest-selling author was back in business with a substantial seven figure advance. A separate deal with the American publisher Simon and Schuster covering hardbacks, paperbacks and audio books is believed to have catapulted that to eight figures. The firm refused to confirm American and Italian newspaper reports of \u00a330m, but a source at Hodder and Stoughton said: \"For three books that figure would not be outrageous.\" The American deal gives King a larger chunk of profits in return for a smaller advance. \"We've broken away from the traditional mould of a huge advance for a best-selling author and entered into a partnership, saying 'let's share the risks and get the greater rewards.'

King - who has sold more than 100m copies of his 36 novels in 33 languages - was already the world's highest paid author after securing a four book contract in 1990 worth \u00a315.6 m. Blockbuster rivals such as Michael Crichton - who commanded \u00a36.4m last November for Timeline - and the notoriously secretive John Grisham - who reportedly earns up to \u00a35m a book - have been playing catch-up but the new contract looks set to widen the gulf further. The deal's announcement astonished readers and publishers who were certain King had slipped into retirement after being run over by a van while walking near his home.

      "body": "<p>Henry Francis Montgomery Stuart, writer, born April 29 1902; died February 2 2000.<br> The Irish writer Francis Stuart, who has died aged 97, was a complex and controversial figure, whose devotion to imaginative fiction led him to live against the tide of convention. Pursuing, as he saw it, the primacy of the interior, private experience over the wider civic responsibility, he spent adventurous times, including working for both the IRA and the Nazis, and - as a much older man - flirting with extreme Protestantism in Ulster. </p> <p>He believed in getting close to the action and was attracted to the energising inspiration of political violence as a spur to creativity - a character trait he shared with Graham Greene. He wrote 20 novels, two plays about political violence and many fine poems. </p> <p>Stuart was born in Queensland, Australia, of sheep-farming immigrant parents from Ulster Protestant stock, and his father died in a mental asylum. An education at Rugby left him with a detestation of imperial manners and trappings, although he went on to study at Trinity College, Dublin, then a staunchly pro-British and Protestant university. At 18, he was in the company of the painter and mystic George Russell and WB Yeats, who thought him \"a dunce\". In 1919, he married Iseult Gonne, daughter of Maud Gonne, the inspiration for many of Yeat's poems of unrequited love, and a militant suffragette and republican. </p> <p>During the Irish civil war, he edited leaflets and ran messages for De Valera's republicans, and was subsequently imprisoned. One of the compelling scenes in a later novel is that of an attempted break-out from his concentration camp. As the guards fire over the prisoners' heads, one stands up and survives the fusillades. It was an image that would become a metaphor for Stuart's own life. </p> <p>On release, he published his first poetry collection, We Have Kept The Faith, which gave him status among revolutionary intellectuals - although Yeats continued to snub him. He worked underground for De Valera's cause, only to experience disillusion when his leader acceded to power and suppressed his former comrades - leaving Stuart and a handful of dissidents without a political base. </p> <p>Stuart pursued his artistic ambitions in rural County Wicklow, where he lived with Iseult Gonne and their children, writing 10 novels in as many years. Few made money, though one, The Pillar Of Cloud, was critically acclaimed. He became a keen devotee of country life and a follower of steeple-chasing, losing money in gambling. </p> <p>When his marriage crumbled in 1939, Stuart moved to Berlin as a lecturer, a post facilitated by a German academic talent-spotting for the Abwehr, or German military intelligence. Stuart, in many respects so absorbed with his own interior journey as to be politically naive, also doubled as a courier for the IRA, then being directed by the Abwehr to become a fifth-column unit in the war against Britain. </p> <p>Though ostensibly lecturing on Anglo-Irish history for German radio, Stuart became part of the Nazi war effort, and wrote scripts for Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce). His other mission, to buy arms for IRA units in Ireland, allegedly fell foul of his own temperament, when, according to one version, the money was spent on champagne and flowers for a Russian dancer. </p> <p>In fact, Russian sympathies were to be his undoing. Initially attracted to Hitler's promise of a new social order, Stuart was dismissed by the radio service when he refused to write anti-Soviet propaganda after the collapse of the Hitler-Stalin pact. He was later to say that communism was the only cause he could respect at the end of the war because of the sufferings of the Russian people. He was interned again, this time by the Allies. </p> <p>Out of the war came more novels, notably The Pillar Of Cloud and Redemption - and the latter name became a theme for much of his subsequent work, in which the protagonist is often in a dream-like state, encountering random violence followed by salvation, in a threatening landscape, usually by the love of a strong woman. </p> <p>During the 1950s, Stuart lived in London with his new German wife, Madeleine. In 1957, they returned to Ireland, where he struggled for a literary livelihood. But his German years continued to dog him. Reviews of reprints of his earlier work and media profiles were laudatory, but eventually focused on his war experiences and led to controversy. A play he submitted to the Abbey Theatre was rejected. The award, by the Irish Arts Council, as a saoi, or visionary, provoked a resignation from the award- giving body. </p> <p>Even in his 90s, Stuart refused to recant his Hitler sympathies, although he did modify his previously published views, saying that he wished no offence to relatives of Holocaust victims. Of the novels, Black List: Section H is likely to survive as a work of Kafkaesque darkness. It mixed elements of the German years with forays into fantasia, and is probably the truest reflection of Stuart's own meandering, instinctive life journey. </p> <p>Madeleine died in 1986, and the following year, aged 85, Stuart married the artist Finola Graham. He is survived by a son and daughter by his first wife. </p> <p><strong>Richard Pine writes: </strong> As a writer, Stuart was predominantly a novelist, with fiercely and uncompromisingly autobiographical works such as Black List: Section H (1971) to his credit, but he was also distinguished as a poet and essayist. His credo was: \"Better to be carried away in any direction, and become a prodigal son or lost sheep, than not be carried away at all.\" He prized individual conscience yet craved the \"natural and recognised roots\" that fate and his own penchant for disaster denied him. </p> <p>The ambiguous title of his early poems, We Have Kept The Faith, characterised his career as a non-joiner who converted to Roman Catholicism, as a thrice-married man who had numerous affairs, as a gambler in search of a home. Yet everything Stuart wrote came out of his own life, painfully chronicling his relationships, his addiction to the turf and his dismay at the downward curve of civilisation. </p> <p>Certainly, if Stuart was at all attracted by fascism, he was in the same company as Yeats, Eliot and Pound in their concern for a unity of culture, for an \u00e9litist concept of civilisation in the age of the masses. His main platform was for Irish neutrality, which made him anti-British from an Irish nationalist point of view, but never pro-Nazi. </p> <p>His reputation will rest on the fate of five books: the remarkable trilogy of Pillar Of Cloud (1948), Redemption (1949) and The Flowering Cross (1950), Black List: Section H, and The High Consistory (1981). The honesty and courage with which they are written, and the intensity with which he approached the themes of faith, conscience, deviance and submission, single him out as a writer who acknowledged that the artist is an outsider, not only because society excludes him, but because he has rejected society's values.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> I didn't like the movie. I found it melodramatic and boring. What added value did you bring to the book?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I didn't want to add anything, I thought it would be taxed afterwards. I thought I'd get VAT [Laughter]. It's hard to say, you want to make a movie because you respond to it instinctively. I can only disagree with you but your opinion is... valuable... definitely. [Laughter] But it's hard to say... when I see the movie I obviously like it otherwise I wouldn't be releasing it.</p> <p><strong>Questioner:</strong> But what did you add that is new?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> The scene in Brighton! [Laughter]</p> <p> <strong>Question 2:</strong> How do you feel about Julianne's character being the only woman in the book?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> For me it was interesting to be dealing with a portrait of a woman who was uninformed by any contemporary ideas and is uninformed by any ideas of sexual politics or of empowerment, everything that goes with the gender conversation these days, but I just felt that Greene's portrait of that lady was actually very accurate and it was incredibly simple in a deep way and very true and what interested me was the way she went from this world of sexuality into this world of something other after this traumatic event. </p> <p>I found it very true and I responded to it very much and that's what I was looking for in the casting of the film and I've always found Julianne in the roles that she's played - there's such an honesty and a directness to the way she approaches the material whatever it is - something as raw as Boogie Nights or as subtle as what she played in the Louis Malle film, Vanya on 42nd Street. </p> <p>She always seems to get beyond the surface aspects of the character into something quite simple and quite deep and that's what I wanted for that role.</p> <p> <strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the universal theme that makes the film so moving?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> What I'm going to say is a bit of a truism, but I think there is something about white light shining through celluloid and showing actors' faces, human emotions coming through faces. When they are emotions that you recognise, when you believe in them and when they are phrased and put in a certain order they have the power on the screen to conjure up some quite unusual responses. That is why there is a cult of film, there is something unique about film. </p> <p>And I think that telling stories in films, even if we've seen them before, we might have seen love affairs before, we might have seen murder stories before, but there seems to be something inherently addictive about it and I think that when all the bits of it are put together, music, text, image, light, when they're in a harmony through the director they can move you. </p> <p>I think that it's a phenomenon, I don't think it's very easy to put succinctly why it has a universality. People fall in love, people have affairs, people die, people make war, people are jealous and I think that if the film has worked for you I would suggest it's because you recognise some fundamental truths in it yourself through it being projected on a screen.</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> There is something deeply uncontemporary about the affair and that's what I loved about it. The way in which they were forced to confront something that they couldn't explain. I don't think anybody who's had any deep contact, sexual or otherwise, with a human being ever loses it. I think a lot of people never survive the depth of affection, whether it be a parent, or a lover or a wife, and the way in which Greene pushed the question of the whole meaning of those relationships to bring up an idea as unfashionable as a God, or a destiny, I found very moving and worth re-examining. I think there is something quite true in what he wrote and I hope we've got something of that truth onto the screen.</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> On a simple level I think that all of us would like to turn the clock back and look at the events that happened around relationships where you could chart back and say, \"Oh my God, that was the point when it worked, when it didn't work, when it could have gone on, when it stopped\". Why I feel rewarded by this fantastic film that Neil has made is that moment when you start to read the diary, you start to see the same scenes repeated and with a different aspect, for me that's dream-like and that's why it's very universal. </p> <p>All of us would love to look back on a moment in their lives when someone has acted in some way untoward or seemingly cruelly and we don't get a chance to do that, to step back and re-see something that's gone wrong from the other person's point of view. I think that's what's absolutely fascinating about the film, and what makes the film absolutely moving for me is that you're suddenly in this other person's head after we've spent all this time in Bendrix's head. Suddenly the emphasis shifts to Sarah's head and her story. The story is written twice from two different perspectives and I think that's why people tend to go back to see it again and again.</p> <p> <strong>Question 4:</strong> Is there a parallel between Onegin's suffering and Bendrix's suffering?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> I keep being asked why I'm always playing these tortured lovers [Laughter], and I can see honestly that there is an emotional constipation in both parts maybe. Certainly Onegin doesn't want to acknowledge his emotions, he's very detached to begin with from his feelings and they seep through during the course of the story but Bendrix - in my head anyway - he's someone who is venting his feelings onto the page, but he's not demonstrative of them to other people. </p> <p>He's wearing a kind of mask when he meets Henry, he's playing another role of the benign friend and in that sense there is probably a connection in that they both carry a mask to a certain extent. But I do think that Bendrix privately is very connected to his feelings and Onegin isn't.</p> <p> <strong>Question 5:</strong> Will the ruling on the certification of the film be overruled?</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> I think that this has been such an issue now that I don't think so. I remember seeing Polanski's Macbeth at school for my English O-level. It had a fantastic effect on me. I loved it, I just thought it was incredible and I couldn't believe how great it was. I was studying this brilliant, sexy violent... all the things that were great about Macbeth are in Polanski's movie and it really fired me on. I think that it's so high-profile, this censorship thing, that this current board are going to walk away from this, they're not going to step down because they would look very foolish now. </p> <p>So I think the only chance now is when this film is released on video there might be a way of cajoling, but I think that unless we cut the film there's going to be little chance of us getting anything below an 18. And it's ironic because Shakespeare in Love had a 15 certificate and yet that seemed to have the same combination of things that we have. But if you're 16 or 17 you can get into a 18 film. [Laughter] But it's not really about that, it's about the messages that that certification sends. </p> <p> <strong>Question 6:</strong> Why did you make the love scenes so explicit when they weren't like that at all in the book?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> It's a deeply erotic book. One of the things that surprised me was when I re-read it was that most erotic novels are written by women and very young men and this was an erotic novel written by a 42-year-old Englishman. That was part of the attraction for me for this thing and Greene has written an extraordinary thing. There is an enormous amount of sex in the book, it's perhaps not described in terms that you get in the book, but actually there is an enormous amount of quite graphic description in the novel itself. </p> <p>That line, \"You wouldn't recognise the sound\" that we have a start of the film, that's straight from the middle of the book and in her diary in the novel she talks about how he touches her the way no-one else touches her, and Greene talks about orgasm quite beautifully with this terrible sense of loss. We had to show things I think otherwise it wouldn't have been an affair. And I think we had to show them quite bleakly in a way, because there is something bleak about that kind of passion somehow.</p> <p> <strong>Question 7:</strong> Neil said that the irrational is very relevant to contemporary life and that's what drew you to the book. Would you elaborate on that?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I don't know what I meant by that [Laughter]. But I do know that I am drawn to stories where people do not fully understand the reasons for their actions and I don't know why that is. It's probably because I don't believe people do fully understand the reasons for their actions. I always think of Thomas Hardy. When his second wife died he lived to be a very old man and then he suddenly got this tremendous sense of longing for the woman he married when he was 19 or 20. </p> <p>It's one of the most irrational bursts of poetry in the whole of literature really and I think that the emotions that affect us, particularly to do with sexuality, I do not believe that anyone understands them - President Clinton definitely doesn't understand them [Laughter] and I don't think Sigmund Freud understood them. I think that they exist in that strange realm somewhere beyond understanding and art in a way. I do think Greene touched on it. I'm not as tortured about religion as he was, I described it to myself as a battle between rationality and something else.</p> <p> <strong>Question 8:</strong> Does the complexity of the chronology, particularly in the first half distance you from an emotional involvement with the characters?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> There is a danger when you deal with two time frames and particularly when you deal with two different perspectives, of totally confusing people. But I don't think distance is a bad thing, people speak about lack of emotional engagement with characters as a bad thing but I'm not sure it's a bad thing. Some of the films that I really do love deeply are quite austere movies. I'm also tired of the over-emotionalism of, particularly, Hollywood cinema. I don't think that it's a bad thing that you can sit and make your mind up about these characters, that you can sit and have some distance from them. That was part of what I wanted about this film. Some people won't like it but... </p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> That wasn't an issue with the studio absolutely not, but I think the point of the movie is that you have to unravel it and I think that one of the things that is a joy about the film is that when Bendrix reads Sarah's diary the penny drops, it's true people who like the movie keep going back to see it again because they realised they've missed an aspect of it.</p> <p><strong>Question 9:</strong> Did you shoot the movie in the same way events are recorded in the book?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> We didn't shoot it any kind of sequence at all. On films there's often basic facts of production, like we had to build an enormous set for Henry's interior so we basically shot everything that was in that interior first, in this case the entire relationship as it's played out in the series of drawing rooms and bedrooms of Henry's house. We went through the film from beginning to end without approaching an exterior so it was almost a tiny play of the entire movie.</p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> It's just financially and logistically impossible to keep returning to locations, because on a film like this, you're constantly seeing the same location and the same set but the action is taking place in a different way. You can't just keep closing the streets of London down, they don't like you closing them down anyway, they hate you to be honest - quite rightly in some respects I suppose. Middleton Square, where we shot the Smythe exterior, in which we come back to in many different ways. We shot all that at once so that's how you have to make films, unfortunately.</p> <p> <strong>Question 9:</strong> How do you work so well?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I met Stephen after I'd made Angel. I was a novelist, I hope I still am. Angel was the first movie I made and it was about political violence in the north of Ireland. I didn't know what I'd made and Stephen saw it at Cannes and he rang me up and I came over here to meet him and at that time he'd set up Palace Pictures and his enthusiasm for film I found quite overwhelming and we then went and made A Company of Wolves together. We just kept working together really... </p> <p><strong>SW:</strong> The interesting thing was, we never had a contract. It wasn't like I signed Neil up for a three-picture deal or anything like that, or we said we'd make films together. The things Neil liked I tended to like, Angela Carter for instance. That was a great thing for us to work with Angela and to make that film, it was a wonderful experience for me. Similarly with Mona Lisa, the kind of subjects we were attracted to were quite similar so it never felt like uncomfortable, it wasn't as if, \"Oh I have to make the horrible Butcher Boy or the terrible Michael Collins\". </p> <p>It was great, what a joy that we can make these quite strange, somewhat subversive pieces of entertainment and how lucky we are to do that. We have a new company now called A Company of Wolves which DreamWorks are funding. It's basically a development company where we're looking for projects and now we do have a signed deal so I should think that the next announcement is that it's all over. [Laughter]. We've actually signed a piece of paper for the first time to produce and direct future projects so I... I've just read that Neil's signed a deal to do a project with Salman Rushdie so that's the end of it anyway [Laughter].</p> <p> <strong>AW:</strong> You dipped your toes into production with Onegin. Are you going to do any more producing?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> Yes, but I wouldn't undertake it lightly. I think as an actor I was quite protected from putting a production on, you have no idea unless you've been on the production side. I was quite ignorant about the level of work and time that had to go into nurturing a film and to put the elements of production together. I have a completely different regard for producers and directors and I don't think the public really know the hours and the detailed structuring that has to go on. I think I would have to feel very strongly about something to want to do it again.</p> <p> <strong>Question 10:</strong> How much freedom did Neil give Ralph to improvise?</p> <p>I suppose we didn't improvise much if at all. It never came up. I always felt that the dialogue was superb and it was beautifully written and I think in the early stages I suggested that one or two lines didn't seem right but that was a very subjective response but actually in shooting... if Neil had said to me \"Improvise\" or \"Change it\" or \"That doesn't sound good\" then I would have done it, but I think I took my cue from him. </p> <p>If I had felt that the dialogue wasn't sitting I would have probably have asked to change things in the moment of shooting it, but it never really came up. I have improvised on films before and I've been encouraged to do so by the director and quite enjoyed, but I think that if he or she and the actor doesn't want you to I think it has to be set up by the director in the first place. In this case it was a path Neil never chose to go down and I went with him.</p> <p> <strong>AW:</strong> Is the theme of Catholicism what appealed to you in The End of the Affair?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> Of course, Greene being an English Catholic convert - which means Protestant [Laughter] and me being a Irish Catholic - which means doomed [Laughter] it's for me who grew up with that stuff. Irish Catholicism is more to do with magic - it's a very superstitious set of lessons you learn when you're a child. It's quite easy to abandon them but they never leave your sensibility, so for me to see someone grappling with these problems of faith and believability which he had encountered in his early 20s - and he had a very dubious relationship to them all his life - I think he liked the cruelty of Catholicism in a strange way. </p> <p>He liked the way it implied punishment but it was a punishment deferred. And I found it fascinating to encounter his encounter with those set of ideas which I had encountered as a child but I think they were with him for his life as an intellectual construct and they've not been with me since I was 19 to be honest.</p> <p><strong>Question 11:</strong> Did Bendrix's repellent character appeal to you?</p> <p><strong>RF:</strong> They don't appeal to me as things I try to emulate in my own life. [Laughter]. I think dramatically, as an actor responding to a part, they're strong meat to play, they're what the part demands of an actor, they're just fantastic, just in terms of what you show, what you don't show, which scenes you get to play. </p> <p>I take your point completely, he is manipulative, he is duplicitous, there is a smear of snobbery with the Smythe thing but I think he's an unhappy man and I think at the end, I don't think he's redeemed but I think something is opened up for him that he has never considered before. I think this friendship with Henry - and there's this tender moment of giving the milk and biscuits - I think that very slowly something is unlocked in Bendrix and I always feel that in the moment of looking at Lance's face at the end. </p> <p>However much he's resisting it he can't ignore it and indeed the very last moment is \"I hate you God, leave me alone forever\", but the conceit of that is I think that for ever on Bendrix has a dialogue even if he's saying he hates him. So I think it's complicated but I don't think he's all the things you describe. There's other things moving on but I think Greene probably delighted in making him a bit repellent. </p> <p>A friend of mine was reading the novel and saying \"God, he is repellent\" and this friend was laughing as she was reading so maybe we enjoy a villain taking us into our confidence. I don't think he is a villain but he is full of a negative quality yet he takes us - the viewer or the reader in - and I like that about it just from a dramatic point of view.</p> <p> <strong>Question 12:</strong> You described your portrayal of sex as quite bleak, but the churches are quite sumptuous and seductive. Why did you do this?</p> <p><strong>NJ:</strong> I don't know... What I found interesting is the portrayal of passion in the novel itself, and as I made the movie, [I was thinking of] how spiritual transport in, say, Renaissance painting is portrayed - showing the human body in a state of sexual transport as well. </p> <p>There is a logic to that, and if you go round churches you see these beautifully modelled torsos - mainly male. And to my mind they're not two sides to the same coin, but they belong together somehow in some way I'd like to understand. But I didn't actually mean to make the church beautiful. </p> <p>We were actually looking at a very grey church. It was one of these huge grey interiors somewhere in Islington and I went downstairs and I found this tiny little chapel and it was full of all this gold and I just wanted a photograph there. Perhaps it is a bit too beautiful but I actually do like churches.</p>",

Middleton Square, where we shot the Smythe exterior, in which we come back to in many different ways. We shot all that at once so that's how you have to make films, unfortunately. Question 9: How do you work so well? NJ: I met Stephen after I'd made Angel. I was a novelist, I hope I still am. Angel was the first movie I made and it was about political violence in the north of Ireland. I didn't know what I'd made and Stephen saw it at Cannes and he rang me up and I came over here to meet him and at that time he'd set up Palace Pictures and his enthusiasm for film I found quite overwhelming and we then went and made A Company of Wolves together. We just kept working together really... SW: The interesting thing was, we never had a contract. It wasn't like I signed Neil up for a three-picture deal or anything like that, or we said we'd make films together. The things Neil liked I tended to like, Angela Carter for instance. That was a great thing for us to work with Angela and to make that film, it was a wonderful experience for me. Similarly with Mona Lisa, the kind of subjects we were attracted to were quite similar so it never felt like uncomfortable, it wasn't as if, \"Oh I have to make the horrible Butcher Boy or the terrible Michael Collins\". It was great, what a joy that we can make these quite strange, somewhat subversive pieces of entertainment and how lucky we are to do that. We have a new company now called A Company of Wolves which DreamWorks are funding. It's basically a development company where we're looking for projects and now we do have a signed deal so I should think that the next announcement is that it's all over. [Laughter]. We've actually signed a piece of paper for the first time to produce and direct future projects so I... I've just read that Neil's signed a deal to do a project with Salman Rushdie so that's the end of it anyway [Laughter]. AW: You dipped your toes into production with Onegin. Are you going to do any more producing? RF: Yes, but I wouldn't undertake it lightly. I think as an actor I was quite protected from putting a production on, you have no idea unless you've been on the production side. I was quite ignorant about the level of work and time that had to go into nurturing a film and to put the elements of production together. I have a completely different regard for producers and directors and I don't think the public really know the hours and the detailed structuring that has to go on. I think I would have to feel very strongly about something to want to do it again. Question 10: How much freedom did Neil give Ralph to improvise? I suppose we didn't improvise much if at all. It never came up. I always felt that the dialogue was superb and it was beautifully written and I think in the early stages I suggested that one or two lines didn't seem right but that was a very subjective response but actually in shooting... if Neil had said to me \"Improvise\" or \"Change it\" or \"That doesn't sound good\" then I would have done it, but I think I took my cue from him. If I had felt that the dialogue wasn't sitting I would have probably have asked to change things in the moment of shooting it, but it never really came up. I have improvised on films before and I've been encouraged to do so by the director and quite enjoyed, but I think that if he or she and the actor doesn't want you to I think it has to be set up by the director in the first place. In this case it was a path Neil never chose to go down and I went with him. AW: Is the theme of Catholicism what appealed to you in The End of the Affair? NJ: Of course, Greene being an English Catholic convert - which means Protestant [Laughter] and me being a Irish Catholic - which means doomed [Laughter] it's for me who grew up with that stuff. Irish Catholicism is more to do with magic - it's a very superstitious set of lessons you learn when you're a child. It's quite easy to abandon them but they never leave your sensibility, so for me to see someone grappling with these problems of faith and believability which he had encountered in his early 20s - and he had a very dubious relationship to them all his life - I think he liked the cruelty of Catholicism in a strange way. He liked the way it implied punishment but it was a punishment deferred. And I found it fascinating to encounter his encounter with those set of ideas which I had encountered as a child but I think they were with him for his life as an intellectual construct and they've not been with me since I was 19 to be honest. Question 11: Did Bendrix's repellent character appeal to you? RF: They don't appeal to me as things I try to emulate in my own life. [Laughter]. I think dramatically, as an actor responding to a part, they're strong meat to play, they're what the part demands of an actor, they're just fantastic, just in terms of what you show, what you don't show, which scenes you get to play. I take your point completely, he is manipulative, he is duplicitous, there is a smear of snobbery with the Smythe thing but I think he's an unhappy man and I think at the end, I don't think he's redeemed but I think something is opened up for him that he has never considered before. I think this friendship with Henry - and there's this tender moment of giving the milk and biscuits - I think that very slowly something is unlocked in Bendrix and I always feel that in the moment of looking at Lance's face at the end. However much he's resisting it he can't ignore it and indeed the very last moment is \"I hate you God, leave me alone forever\", but the conceit of that is I think that for ever on Bendrix has a dialogue even if he's saying he hates him. So I think it's complicated but I don't think he's all the things you describe. There's other things moving on but I think Greene probably delighted in making him a bit repellent. A friend of mine was reading the novel and saying \"God, he is repellent\" and this friend was laughing as she was reading so maybe we enjoy a villain taking us into our confidence. I don't think he is a villain but he is full of a negative quality yet he takes us - the viewer or the reader in - and I like that about it just from a dramatic point of view. Question 12: You described your portrayal of sex as quite bleak, but the churches are quite sumptuous and seductive. Why did you do this? NJ: I don't know... What I found interesting is the portrayal of passion in the novel itself, and as I made the movie, [I was thinking of] how spiritual transport in, say, Renaissance painting is portrayed - showing the human body in a state of sexual transport as well. There is a logic to that, and if you go round churches you see these beautifully modelled torsos - mainly male. And to my mind they're not two sides to the same coin, but they belong together somehow in some way I'd like to understand. But I didn't actually mean to make the church beautiful. We were actually looking at a very grey church. It was one of these huge grey interiors somewhere in Islington and I went downstairs and I found this tiny little chapel and it was full of all this gold and I just wanted a photograph there. Perhaps it is a bit too beautiful but I actually do like churches.",

      "bodyText": "Labour suffered a setback last night in the Ceredigion byelection, finishing fourth behind Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives respectively. The nationalists, as expected, held the Welsh-speaking rural seat where the turnout was 47%, a drop of 27.8% from 1997. The seat was left vacant after sitting MP Cynog Dafis quit to concentrate on his work as a member of the Welsh assembly. But Labour, which came second to Plaid Cymru at the general election, suffered after a campaign in which opposition parties sought to make the government's record on the rural economy a key issue. The poll, in which Simon Thomas became the first new MP of the millennium, coincided with a prime ministerial \"rural ride\" to the west country amid escalating calls for more support from farmers. In Wales, meanwhile, opposition parties have sought to capitalise on growing disarray in the new assembly, where Alun Michael's minority regime is facing accusations of selling the country short on European funding for its poorest areas. The first secretary faces a motion of no confidence. Labour played down suggestions that the result amounted to an anti-government protest vote by the largely agricultural community. Mr Thomas, 36, a rural community development manager, succeeds Mr Dafis, who had a 6,961 majority over Labour in 1997. The result Simon Thomas, Plaid Cymru: 10,716 Mark Williams, Liberal Democrat: 5,768 Paul Davies, Conservative 4,138 Maria Battle, Labour 3,612",

      "body": "<p>Who started this \"them and us\" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth.</p> <p>Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover. They are not \"the countryside\". They are a bunch of Tory hunters and farmers who no more represent most country dwellers than red-braced commodity brokers in City champagne bars represent townies.</p> <p>Blair has the facts on his side and he delivered a barrage of them yesterday: the countryside is doing pretty well. There is a farming crisis, there is real rural poverty (though proportionately less) but life for most people in the country is better than in towns. They are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer. Not surprisingly townies tell pollsters they wish they lived there too.</p> <p>The traditional left likes to stress the two nations of the north/south divide while the right tries to capitalise on a rural/urban split, both playing to their own electoral heartlands. William Hague was stoking up that old anti-townie sentiment in his speech to the NFU this week: \"The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing about the countryside.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair is attempting to dismantle the banality of these national semi-myths: the north is also rich, the south also poor, town and country share most common concerns. In Devon yesterday he rightly sought to disentangle the tiny farming industry from most of rural life. Agriculture is only 1% of GDP and only employs 2% of the workforce in England. Even in rural areas it only employs 4% of the workforce. Like everyone else, most people work in services or in small businesses. There is no \"rural crisis\".</p> <p>But yes, there is indeed a farming crisis and this is the worst agricultural recession since the 30s. What should be done? \"Income can go down as well as up and is not guaranteed,\" says the very small print at the bottom of all financial service ads. Most of us live with that possibility because it is part of the human condition to know that disaster can strike.</p> <p>But farmers seem to consider themselves outside the cut and thrust of the normal market processes they so heartily endorse when they go into the polling booths to vote Tory. In real terms farmers' incomes rose by 100% between 1990 and 1995. But now they have dropped by 60% since then. There's every reason to feel especially sorry for the 20% who are tenant farmers with nothing to sell up, but most farmers own valuable land, the price of which has soared recently.</p> <p>Yet even farmers sitting on a fortune think they should be bailed out. Why? Walk into the bankruptcy court any day of the week and case after case will bring tears to your eyes at the sight of so many decent people wiped out by bad luck or bad judgment. Two out of three new business start-ups fail. Farmers are not the only hard-pressed businessmen to commit suicide. Should the state step in and bail them all out?</p> <p>Images of the harsh treatment meted out to the miners colour all our current attitudes towards compensating lame-duck industries. Mrs Thatcher said we couldn't and shouldn't pay people to dig out coal no one wanted, so now it's hard to see why farmers should be paid to breed unsaleable cattle, pigs and lambs. Global markets change and in over-producing meat, farmers misjudged their markets. It happens. We can feel very sorry for them, though their political attitudes don't always make it easy. Letting the Countryside Alliance be their advocate is about as helpful to their cause as Arthur Scargill was to the miners'.</p> <p>Cleverer leadership would have had the farmers' tractors rolling down Whitehall long ago to protest at the high pound which is the gravest single cause of their distress.

      "bodyText": "Who started this \"them and us\" between town and country? The mis-named Countryside Alliance when they marched on London last year and later brayed outside the Labour party conference in Bournemouth. Yesterday the prime minister went to Devon and blew their cover. They are not \"the countryside\". They are a bunch of Tory hunters and farmers who no more represent most country dwellers than red-braced commodity brokers in City champagne bars represent townies. Blair has the facts on his side and he delivered a barrage of them yesterday: the countryside is doing pretty well. There is a farming crisis, there is real rural poverty (though proportionately less) but life for most people in the country is better than in towns. They are healthier, happier, safer, better educated and richer. Not surprisingly townies tell pollsters they wish they lived there too. The traditional left likes to stress the two nations of the north/south divide while the right tries to capitalise on a rural/urban split, both playing to their own electoral heartlands. William Hague was stoking up that old anti-townie sentiment in his speech to the NFU this week: \"The rural way of life is under threat from urban values, Islington pressure groups and a metropolitan elite who know nothing about the countryside.\" Tony Blair is attempting to dismantle the banality of these national semi-myths: the north is also rich, the south also poor, town and country share most common concerns. In Devon yesterday he rightly sought to disentangle the tiny farming industry from most of rural life. Agriculture is only 1% of GDP and only employs 2% of the workforce in England. Even in rural areas it only employs 4% of the workforce. Like everyone else, most people work in services or in small businesses. There is no \"rural crisis\". But yes, there is indeed a farming crisis and this is the worst agricultural recession since the 30s. What should be done? \"Income can go down as well as up and is not guaranteed,\" says the very small print at the bottom of all financial service ads. Most of us live with that possibility because it is part of the human condition to know that disaster can strike. But farmers seem to consider themselves outside the cut and thrust of the normal market processes they so heartily endorse when they go into the polling booths to vote Tory. In real terms farmers' incomes rose by 100% between 1990 and 1995. But now they have dropped by 60% since then. There's every reason to feel especially sorry for the 20% who are tenant farmers with nothing to sell up, but most farmers own valuable land, the price of which has soared recently. Yet even farmers sitting on a fortune think they should be bailed out. Why? Walk into the bankruptcy court any day of the week and case after case will bring tears to your eyes at the sight of so many decent people wiped out by bad luck or bad judgment. Two out of three new business start-ups fail. Farmers are not the only hard-pressed businessmen to commit suicide. Should the state step in and bail them all out? Images of the harsh treatment meted out to the miners colour all our current attitudes towards compensating lame-duck industries. Mrs Thatcher said we couldn't and shouldn't pay people to dig out coal no one wanted, so now it's hard to see why farmers should be paid to breed unsaleable cattle, pigs and lambs. Global markets change and in over-producing meat, farmers misjudged their markets. It happens. We can feel very sorry for them, though their political attitudes don't always make it easy. Letting the Countryside Alliance be their advocate is about as helpful to their cause as Arthur Scargill was to the miners'. Cleverer leadership would have had the farmers' tractors rolling down Whitehall long ago to protest at the high pound which is the gravest single cause of their distress. Other industries get some benefit from cheaper imported raw materials, but for farmers who import nothing the high cost of exporting is pure calamity. The NFU has always been pro-euro, but they haven't rolled out their tanks to demand early entry. Where are the green Barbours on platforms up and down the land demanding we join and that everything is done to lower interest rates, bring down the value of the pound and make euro entry possible?

      "body": "<p>One of the more confusing, even surreal, days of Tony Blair's thousand-odd in power involved him having to contend with the affairs of Britain's most troubled region while simultaneously traipsing round its gentlest.</p> <p>The prime minister was starting a two-day tour of Devon and Cornwall, a faraway country mostly comprising Tory-Lib Dem marginals, of which he appears to know little. At any rate, he called the river Tamar the \"Tammar\".</p> <p>This trip is part of a series of regional tours that constitute the very first move in the seduction of the electorate scheduled for consummation next year. He is, in effect, undoing the electorate's top shirt button. In December he went to the north-west. Scotland comes soon. Wales is rather dodgy at the moment.</p> <p>Mr Blair spent the day in Exeter and Plymouth. He cares very deeply about the farmers, of course, but not so deeply that they can't wait another 24 hours.</p> <p>The focal point of the day was a speech to about 200 businessmen and women at Exeter university. He also visited a ceramics factory and on two separate occasions stared - in his \"gee-whizz-but-gosh-what-do-I-do-with-this-mouse-thingy?\" kind of way - at a couple of internet projects, one run by the yachtsman Pete Goss.</p> <p>One aspect of this, put bluntly by the CBI regional vice-chairman, Steve Hindley, is that agriculture is responsible for only 4% of GDP even in the south-west. It is only 1% in the country as a whole. This was helpful to Mr Blair, who was trying to ram home the message contained in the mega-report on the rural economy prepared by the cabinet office: while farmers are suffering, many other people in the countryside are not.</p> <p><b>Uneasy coalition</b><br></p> <p>As the report says, far more people in the countryside work in services, IT and public administration. (Indeed, in many places, local councils are the largest employers.) Rural tourism could soon overtake agriculture as a source of employment.</p> <p>\"Farming is in crisis,\" Mr Blair admitted in his speech. \"But there are villages, towns and cities in very rural parts of Britain that in fact face the same problems as the rest of Britain.\" This appears to be code for saying they don't really face that many problems at all.</p> <p>\"The answer is not to divide the country up,\" he went on, \"but to bring it together. I am a one-nation politician and this is a one-nation government.\" This was partly directed at critics inside his own party. But farmers were also intended as recipients.</p> <p>Arguably, this is the worst of all messages to give farmers who, at the best of times (which these aren't), are prone to sit in their tractors brooding. Tell them that, whatever their troubles, the people down the road - who have probably just moved in from town, anyway - are doing really well, seems about the worst strategy of all.</p> <p>What Mr Blair seems only to half grasp is the extent to which the countryside is an uneasy coalition between locals and in-comers. The balance of power varies: from home counties villages overwhelmed by expanding concrete, to tracts of the Cotswolds dominated by weekenders, to remote corners where only the old are left or move in. This may fit in with the prime minister's idea of a fluid society, but when the economic disparities are as huge as they are now the consequences are deeply unsettling.</p> <p>There is a better technique and it worked on two of Mr Blair's most vigorous opponents. As he prepared to leave the university after his speech, Robert Persey, a pig farmer from Honiton, was leading a group of protesters and kept up a non-stop barrage of abuse over a mega phone: \"Tony, tell us why you are murdering the British pig industry.\"</p> <p>So Tony took up the challenge. Mr Persey and one of his allies, Ben Pullen, a Gloucestershire dairy farmer, were called in for tea and sympathy. Twenty minutes later, Mr Persey reeled out, transformed: \"He understands our problems - he was very sympathetic - I was greatly impressed.\" Mr Blair told Mr Persey he would like to give pig farmers some money, but there were problems with the exchequer. Mr Persey appeared to accept this. This man could sell sand to Saudis.</p> <p>Mr Blair travelled by train from Exeter to Plymouth. Improbably, it was on time. On the journey two television personalities marched into his carriage past the security and, like the farmers, got 15 minutes of his time. He had been expecting Mr Ahern. He got Richard and Judy, on the way to their house in Cornwall. \"It was just chit-chat,\" said Richard. It sort of made the prime minister's point, though: the south-west is not just about poor farmers - it has rich TV presenters too.</p> <p><b>Poor relations?</b><br>A regional guide</p> <p><b> North-east</b></p> <p>Lowest proportion of population living in rural areas (9.8%).

      "bodyText": "One of the more confusing, even surreal, days of Tony Blair's thousand-odd in power involved him having to contend with the affairs of Britain's most troubled region while simultaneously traipsing round its gentlest. The prime minister was starting a two-day tour of Devon and Cornwall, a faraway country mostly comprising Tory-Lib Dem marginals, of which he appears to know little. At any rate, he called the river Tamar the \"Tammar\". This trip is part of a series of regional tours that constitute the very first move in the seduction of the electorate scheduled for consummation next year. He is, in effect, undoing the electorate's top shirt button. In December he went to the north-west. Scotland comes soon. Wales is rather dodgy at the moment. Mr Blair spent the day in Exeter and Plymouth. He cares very deeply about the farmers, of course, but not so deeply that they can't wait another 24 hours. The focal point of the day was a speech to about 200 businessmen and women at Exeter university. He also visited a ceramics factory and on two separate occasions stared - in his \"gee-whizz-but-gosh-what-do-I-do-with-this-mouse-thingy?\" kind of way - at a couple of internet projects, one run by the yachtsman Pete Goss. One aspect of this, put bluntly by the CBI regional vice-chairman, Steve Hindley, is that agriculture is responsible for only 4% of GDP even in the south-west. It is only 1% in the country as a whole. This was helpful to Mr Blair, who was trying to ram home the message contained in the mega-report on the rural economy prepared by the cabinet office: while farmers are suffering, many other people in the countryside are not. Uneasy coalition As the report says, far more people in the countryside work in services, IT and public administration. (Indeed, in many places, local councils are the largest employers.) Rural tourism could soon overtake agriculture as a source of employment. \"Farming is in crisis,\" Mr Blair admitted in his speech. \"But there are villages, towns and cities in very rural parts of Britain that in fact face the same problems as the rest of Britain.\" This appears to be code for saying they don't really face that many problems at all. \"The answer is not to divide the country up,\" he went on, \"but to bring it together. I am a one-nation politician and this is a one-nation government.\" This was partly directed at critics inside his own party. But farmers were also intended as recipients. Arguably, this is the worst of all messages to give farmers who, at the best of times (which these aren't), are prone to sit in their tractors brooding. Tell them that, whatever their troubles, the people down the road - who have probably just moved in from town, anyway - are doing really well, seems about the worst strategy of all. What Mr Blair seems only to half grasp is the extent to which the countryside is an uneasy coalition between locals and in-comers. The balance of power varies: from home counties villages overwhelmed by expanding concrete, to tracts of the Cotswolds dominated by weekenders, to remote corners where only the old are left or move in. This may fit in with the prime minister's idea of a fluid society, but when the economic disparities are as huge as they are now the consequences are deeply unsettling. There is a better technique and it worked on two of Mr Blair's most vigorous opponents. As he prepared to leave the university after his speech, Robert Persey, a pig farmer from Honiton, was leading a group of protesters and kept up a non-stop barrage of abuse over a mega phone: \"Tony, tell us why you are murdering the British pig industry.\" So Tony took up the challenge. Mr Persey and one of his allies, Ben Pullen, a Gloucestershire dairy farmer, were called in for tea and sympathy. Twenty minutes later, Mr Persey reeled out, transformed: \"He understands our problems - he was very sympathetic - I was greatly impressed.\" Mr Blair told Mr Persey he would like to give pig farmers some money, but there were problems with the exchequer. Mr Persey appeared to accept this. This man could sell sand to Saudis. Mr Blair travelled by train from Exeter to Plymouth. Improbably, it was on time. On the journey two television personalities marched into his carriage past the security and, like the farmers, got 15 minutes of his time. He had been expecting Mr Ahern. He got Richard and Judy, on the way to their house in Cornwall. \"It was just chit-chat,\" said Richard. It sort of made the prime minister's point, though: the south-west is not just about poor farmers - it has rich TV presenters too. Poor relations? A regional guide North-east Lowest proportion of population living in rural areas (9.8%). Legacy of coal mining has left villages without access to modern transport systems. GDP from farming, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a3535m North-west Cumbria and Pennines are remote, sparsely populated and heavily dependent on a vulnerable agricultural industry. West Lancashire and Cheshire are traditionally more affluent but under pressure from declining farm commodity prices. GDP from farming, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a3575m. Population in rural areas: 17.7% Yorkshire and the Humber Diverse rural problems: dependency on agriculture, low pay, ageing population, pockets of unemployment. Also significant strengths: entrepreneurial skills of new migrants and growth of tourism. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.1bn. Population in rural areas: 20.4% East Midlands Rural pay lower than average. Poor transport infrastructure a major problem, but the urban population's demand for access means rural areas are sustainable. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.14bn. Population in rural areas: 45.7% West Midlands Heavy fall in livestock income in the last 10 years. Remote areas face particular challenge but wider picture less gloomy. Some rural wealth above English average. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.14bn. Population in rural areas: 20.8% South-west Third most prosperous region in UK, with some \"economic disparities\". Some rural jobs lost but businesses relocated from London. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.85bn. Population in rural areas: 53.3%. South-east Relative affluence with pockets of rural deprivation. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.4bn. Population in rural areas: 46.6% Eastern North of region dependent on vulnerable agricultural industry where farm incomes declined by 75%. Substantial developmental pressures in commuting areas. GDP from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing: \u00a31.1bn. Population in rural areas: 43.3%. Wales 77% of agricultural land less favoured status, 52% severely disadvantaged. Significant number of farms below level viable to support a family. Many pressures on sustainability of rural communities. Scotland Rural unemployment rates below Scottish level with growing population. Pleasant place to live, agriculture still cornerstone of rural economy. Northern Ireland Faces severe financial difficulties. Farming income declined by 79% compared with 60% across UK.",

That country is surely not on the road back to fascism.

But Austria's was a particularly highly organised dispensation, and one particularly dear to its citizens.</p> <p>The failed coalition negotiations between the Social Democratic and the People's parties revolved around how much of it could be retained. Would the People's party, itching to be \"proper\" European conservatives, cutting and privatising with the rest of them, be allowed to impose an austerity programme, including welfare reductions, and have the unions sign up to it, even though they would have been the junior partner in government? Could the Social Democrats countenance that, and could they also countenance moves away from neutrality?

Hella Pick, formerly the Guardian's diplomatic editor, says in her new book on Austria that the old way, sensible enough in the past, \"has served to stultify Austria's democratic institutions and to make political patronage an all pervasive and corrosive phenomenon. It has reached the point where the democratic system, as operated in Austria, has run into the buffers.\"</p> <p>The Austrian sociologist Adolph Holl suggests that the old duality is being eclipsed by a new one. \"On the one hand, you have a middle-aged, well educated group that wants reforms of a certain kind, and they tend toward the Green party,\" he says. \"On the other you have many of the young, as well as blue collar people of all ages, and workers who have lost their jobs . . . and they tend, at the moment, toward Haider.\"</p> <p>In this realignment there is hope.

He demands action in areas where he knows it has already been taken, as with immigration, or in areas where he knows Austria has no serious chance of changing things, as on restricting European Union expansion.

Besides, the allies had deemed Austria Hitler's \"first victim\" in 1944 in an attempt to encourage resistance to the Nazis, despite Hitler's annexation of March 1938 being greeted deliriously by huge crowds on the streets, and despite the prominence of many Austrians at the apex of the Nazi party.</p> <p>It was only in 1991 that the chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, declared officially that Austria had also been an accomplice of the Nazis.</p> <p>A monument in Vienna's centre, featuring elderly Jews bent double scrubbing a city pavement with a toothbrush, took seven years to be finished against stiff resistance. Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust memorial on Judenplatz has similarly been subject to endless bureaucratic delays and widespread resistance from a public keen to forget or distort the past.</p> <p>A huge memorial to the Red Army troops who helped to liberate Vienna in 1945 stands proudly on Schwarzenbergplatz, emphasising the other historical myth. It was, of course, the Russians who insisted on Austria's \"permanent neutrality\" as the price of the Red Army's withdrawal from Vienna across the cold war frontline into Hungary in 1955.</p> <p>But permanent neutrality, it is argued, was the Austrians' free choice and is now an integral element of the national identity. Comparisons are made with Switzerland, as if centuries of stubborn Swiss isolationism were analogous to Austria's subjection to a Kremlin demand.</p> <p>The Waldheim scandal brought Austria international isolation and humiliation. The president could not travel to the US, for example. But he ran on a campaign embodying the national amnesia, raging against \"international slander\". He took half the vote.</p> <p>Mr Haider may mine a rich electoral seam by similarly playing the role of democracy's martyr. And he is a much more talented vote-getter than Mr Waldheim ever was.</p>",

Besides, the allies had deemed Austria Hitler's \"first victim\" in 1944 in an attempt to encourage resistance to the Nazis, despite Hitler's annexation of March 1938 being greeted deliriously by huge crowds on the streets, and despite the prominence of many Austrians at the apex of the Nazi party. It was only in 1991 that the chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, declared officially that Austria had also been an accomplice of the Nazis. A monument in Vienna's centre, featuring elderly Jews bent double scrubbing a city pavement with a toothbrush, took seven years to be finished against stiff resistance. Rachel Whiteread's Holocaust memorial on Judenplatz has similarly been subject to endless bureaucratic delays and widespread resistance from a public keen to forget or distort the past. A huge memorial to the Red Army troops who helped to liberate Vienna in 1945 stands proudly on Schwarzenbergplatz, emphasising the other historical myth. It was, of course, the Russians who insisted on Austria's \"permanent neutrality\" as the price of the Red Army's withdrawal from Vienna across the cold war frontline into Hungary in 1955. But permanent neutrality, it is argued, was the Austrians' free choice and is now an integral element of the national identity. Comparisons are made with Switzerland, as if centuries of stubborn Swiss isolationism were analogous to Austria's subjection to a Kremlin demand. The Waldheim scandal brought Austria international isolation and humiliation. The president could not travel to the US, for example. But he ran on a campaign embodying the national amnesia, raging against \"international slander\". He took half the vote. Mr Haider may mine a rich electoral seam by similarly playing the role of democracy's martyr. And he is a much more talented vote-getter than Mr Waldheim ever was.",

The industry's alarm that European tourists might take their business elsewhere grew when the Belgian foreign minister advised his countrymen not to take skiing trips to Austria. Martin Uitz, manager of the Salzburg province tourist authority, said that an unspecified number of cancellations had been received, particularly from Germany and Switzerland. Officials in Leogang, in western Salzburg province, were awaiting cancellation of trips by Israeli tourist groups, an expected loss of 15,000 overnight stays this summer, one news agency reported. Unconfirmed reports said that a major medical congress scheduled for next year in Innsbruck might not take place because US sponsors were considering pulling out. In Britain, reaction was more muted. Marion Telsnig the public relations manager for Thomson holidays, said that so far there had been no increase in the usual number of cancellations for holidays to Austria. \"I think people who have saved all year for their skiing holiday would not cancel for that,\" Ms Telsnig said.",

Mr Thompson said that 365, which is sitting on a cash pile of around \u00a350m following its December float, would continue to expand aggressively through both organic growth and acquisition. The company is in the process of developing software and technology capable of delivering its content across multiple platforms. Shares in 365 performed brightly after listing in December and hit a high of 272p, but have since struggled to live up to their pre-float hype. Last night the shares closed down 4p at 228p, following a 16% rise the previous day.",

Mr Yastrzhembsky said Mr Babitsky, a veteran reporter for the US-funded Radio Liberty who has been missing since January 15, was exchanged for two Russian servicemen yesterday afternoon south of the Chechen capital, Grozny. The exchange was filmed and the footage would be made available to the media, the Kremlin said last night. It was a stunning development in a two-week drama involving Mr Babitsky. The reported swap of a journalist hostile to the Russian campaign for Russian soldiers coincided with a warning from Mr Putin's national security chief, Sergei Ivanov, for the media to toe the government line when reporting the war. \"From now on, all federal authorities bear no responsibility for the correspondent's fate,\" said Mr Yastrzhembsky. Andrei Mironov, an activist with Moscow's Memorial human rights group and an expert on Chechnya who knows Mr Babitsky, said he was \"alarmed\" at the news. \"I'm very frightened by Yastrzhembsky's statement that the Russians are no longer responsible for his life,\" he said. On Wednesday, after contacts between Russian officials and Radio Liberty staff, it was reported that Mr Babitsky was about to be escorted from Chechnya to Moscow and released on assurances that he would not return to Chechnya. But Mr Yastrzhembsky announced yesterday that Mr Babitsky had been handed over to a Chechen warlord, Turpalali Atgeriyev, in exchange for two Russian soldiers on the initiative of the Chechens and with the assent of Mr Babitsky. Mr Yastrzhembsky showed journalists two documents, a hand-written proposal from the Chechens for the exchange and a copy of a statement signed by Mr Babitsky declaring the journalist's eagerness \"to provide assistance in the release of forcibly detained servicemen\". \"We don't know who he was given over to,\" Mrs Babitsky said. \"If he gave written consent for the exchange, why hasn't he been allowed to call home? \"He has a family and children here. This was done to strip him of all his rights so that he won't be able to work in this horrible country.\" Mr Mironov said: \"Putin personally promised to pursue Babitsky's fate, and now we have learned a bit more about Putin than we knew before.\"",

      "body": "<p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats have agreed a joint stance on reform of the European Union, in a remarkable piece of co-operation that keeps alive Tony Blair's \"project\" of consensual politics.</p> <p>The partnership between Labour and the Liberal Democrats has been fragile in recent months as electoral reform, the Liberal Democrats' big prize, slipped down the Labour agenda. But today's publication of the document setting out a common negotiating position for the forthcoming European summits on enlargement will revive speculation of closer ties in the future. \"It is about ongoing co-operation. It is about being inclusive,\" a Labour source said.</p> <p>The document, intended to be a counter-blast at Tory Euro-scepticism, says the two parties want to promote an agenda that is \"pro-Europe, pro-enlargement and pro-reform\". A common stance is set out on various issues, including surrender of the British veto (though only in a few areas), number of commissioners and role of the European parliament.</p> <p>Both Labour and the the Liberal Democrats said yesterday it was a first for two political parties to reach consensus on an approach to be taken at the negotiating table - all the more unusual for the fact that one of the parties was not even in the government.</p> <p>Talks between the two parties on Europe were agreed before Christmas at a meeting, chaired by Tony Blair, of a joint cabinet commitee, which is attended by a mixture of senior Labour and Liberal Democrats. It was the first such meeting since Charles Kennedy became Liberal Democrat leader.</p> <p>Robin Cook, along with Mr Blair, is the main advocate of closer ties with the Liberal Democrats. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, is another supporter of \"big tent\" politics but the rest of the cabinet, especially the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, tend to be cool.</p> <p>An intergovernmental conference at the end of the year in France promises to be one of the most important European summits, paving the way for an increase in member countries to 28, most of them from eastern Europe. A preliminary IGC is to be held in a fortnight to pave the way.</p> <p>In their joint paper, Labour and the Liberal Democrats set out \"Britain's core objectives for institutional reform in the IGC to ensure that enlargement can happen\". It adds: \"Our influence will be stronger if we go into the negotiations with a postive agenda of our own instead of simply threatening to veto the ideas of others, as in previous IGCs.\"</p> <p>On the most controversial issue, the extension of qualified majority voting in the main decision making body, the council of ministers, the two are in favour, in contrast with the Conservatives who see this as dilution of sovereignty.</p> <p>The document says: \"Those who claim that QMV is a threat to Britain's interests ignore all the available evidence. Compared to many other member states, Britain is rarely outvoted in the council of ministers, only five times in the last two years. In the same period Germany was outvoted 20 times and France eight times.</p> <p>\"Those who ideologically oppose any extension of QMV often talk as though the rest of Europe wants to gang up on us. This has no rational basis. It is evidence of the paranoia and defeatism that characterises British anti-Europeanism.\"</p> <p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats say in the document the best way forward is to look at the extension of QMV on a case by case basis, favouring it for liberalisation of transport and certain EU appointments but retaining the veto for treaty changes, taxation, social security, defence, border controls, and own resources.</p> <p>Talks between the Labour and Liberal Democrat sides are scheduled to continue throughout the year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour and the Liberal Democrats have agreed a joint stance on reform of the European Union, in a remarkable piece of co-operation that keeps alive Tony Blair's \"project\" of consensual politics. The partnership between Labour and the Liberal Democrats has been fragile in recent months as electoral reform, the Liberal Democrats' big prize, slipped down the Labour agenda. But today's publication of the document setting out a common negotiating position for the forthcoming European summits on enlargement will revive speculation of closer ties in the future. \"It is about ongoing co-operation. It is about being inclusive,\" a Labour source said. The document, intended to be a counter-blast at Tory Euro-scepticism, says the two parties want to promote an agenda that is \"pro-Europe, pro-enlargement and pro-reform\". A common stance is set out on various issues, including surrender of the British veto (though only in a few areas), number of commissioners and role of the European parliament. Both Labour and the the Liberal Democrats said yesterday it was a first for two political parties to reach consensus on an approach to be taken at the negotiating table - all the more unusual for the fact that one of the parties was not even in the government. Talks between the two parties on Europe were agreed before Christmas at a meeting, chaired by Tony Blair, of a joint cabinet commitee, which is attended by a mixture of senior Labour and Liberal Democrats. It was the first such meeting since Charles Kennedy became Liberal Democrat leader. Robin Cook, along with Mr Blair, is the main advocate of closer ties with the Liberal Democrats. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, is another supporter of \"big tent\" politics but the rest of the cabinet, especially the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, tend to be cool. An intergovernmental conference at the end of the year in France promises to be one of the most important European summits, paving the way for an increase in member countries to 28, most of them from eastern Europe. A preliminary IGC is to be held in a fortnight to pave the way. In their joint paper, Labour and the Liberal Democrats set out \"Britain's core objectives for institutional reform in the IGC to ensure that enlargement can happen\". It adds: \"Our influence will be stronger if we go into the negotiations with a postive agenda of our own instead of simply threatening to veto the ideas of others, as in previous IGCs.\" On the most controversial issue, the extension of qualified majority voting in the main decision making body, the council of ministers, the two are in favour, in contrast with the Conservatives who see this as dilution of sovereignty. The document says: \"Those who claim that QMV is a threat to Britain's interests ignore all the available evidence. Compared to many other member states, Britain is rarely outvoted in the council of ministers, only five times in the last two years. In the same period Germany was outvoted 20 times and France eight times. \"Those who ideologically oppose any extension of QMV often talk as though the rest of Europe wants to gang up on us. This has no rational basis. It is evidence of the paranoia and defeatism that characterises British anti-Europeanism.\" Labour and the Liberal Democrats say in the document the best way forward is to look at the extension of QMV on a case by case basis, favouring it for liberalisation of transport and certain EU appointments but retaining the veto for treaty changes, taxation, social security, defence, border controls, and own resources. Talks between the Labour and Liberal Democrat sides are scheduled to continue throughout the year.",

Until now, the Bush campaign had conspicuously refused to condemn efforts by the Republican party's state machine, headed by Governor George Pataki, to contest Mr McCain's right to be on the ballot in almost half the state's 31 congressional districts.

The attempt to bar Mr McCain has attracted widespread bad publicity for the Bush camp. The New York Republican congressman Peter King has complained that New York state and Iran are the only places in the world where governments decide whether their opponents can stand for election, while Mr McCain led a march to the local Russian consulate to congratulate them on having a more democratic election system than New York state. Mr Bush's strategist Karl Rove told New York backers on Wednesday that Mr Bush would prefer his supporters not to appeal if Mr McCain's court challenge is successful, as experts believe it will be. The story took an unexpected turn yesterday when a court removed Mr Bush's name from the ballot in New York's 16th congressional district, which covers the heavily Democratic South Bronx area. The state Republican party acknowledged that its workers had forged scores of signatures on Mr Bush's election petition, including those of military personnel stationed overseas and an 85-year-old blind woman.

Her grandfather, John Dumbrell, was driving them to Heathrow.</p> <p>In a statement read out to the inquest in Woking, Surrey, Mr Dumbrell said he had moved forward about three yards in the drive, facing the road, but stopped the car when he realised he had forgotten his glasses.</p> <p>He left the engine running as he went to fetch them. As he returned to the house somebody shouted that the car was moving. \"I went to get back but it was moving too quickly. I got hold of the door but could not open it. The car went through the fence and tipped into the river.\"</p> <p>His son-in-law, Ian Henderson, battled to free Sarah from the back seat. \"He was half out of the car as it floated out about 12ft. Then the current turned it over, and it continued to float downstream.\"</p> <p>Sarah's mother, Mary, a doctor, swam out to the car, said Mr Dumbrell. \"She went to the offside door, and Ian was trying to get to the back door to save his daughter. At this point the car started to sink.\"</p> <p>As it went out of sight Mrs Henderson helped her husband back to the bank, where a crowd was gathering.</p> <p>Mr Dumbrell said: \"There was a group of people trying to get a boat started. I ran back to the house and phoned an ambulance before running back to try to start my own boat.\"</p> <p>The inquest heard that the car was not located for several hours, and efforts by doctors and paramedics to resuscitate Sarah failed.</p> <p>Mr Henderson, a civil servant, told the inquest: \"I managed to get out, but it was not possible to get my daughter out. She was strapped into the middle seat, and it was impossible to get across to her and release her.\"</p> <p>The inquest heard that the Mercedes, which had done 39,000 miles, had a parking brake operated by a foot pedal and released by a lever.</p> <p>A traffic investigator, PC David Pendleton, said the car had been serviced last July and there was \"nothing apparently wrong\". The brakes were \"sufficiently operative\".</p> <p>He added: \"While the engine is cold the automatic choke would operate and would tend to drive the car forward. However, if it is on a very slight incline under normal circumstances, for example waiting at traffic lights, it would need an application of the accelerator to drive it forward.\"</p> <p>He said once the car had started to move forward it would have been impossible to apply the parking brake from the passenger seat.</p> <p>A pathologist, Michael Hall, concluded that Sarah, who was a pupil at Henshaw Church of England primary school, died of drowning.</p> <p>Recording the verdict of accidental death, the Surrey coroner, Michael Burgess, said: \"I am sure all of us feel for the family, all generations of the family, and we extend to the family heartfelt condolences on this very sad death.\"</p> <p>Mr and Mrs Henderson have two other daughters, Ruth, four, and Alexandra, 22 months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The grandfather and father of a girl aged five who drowned when the grandfather's car plunged into the Thames told an inquest yesterday of the desperate battle to save her. Sarah Henderson drowned when the Mercedes 230E automatic rolled out of her grandfather's drive, crashed through railings and sank in the river at Shepperton, Surrey, last December. Sarah, of Redburn, Northumberland, had been staying with her family at her grandparents' home and was setting off with her father for a flight home. Her grandfather, John Dumbrell, was driving them to Heathrow. In a statement read out to the inquest in Woking, Surrey, Mr Dumbrell said he had moved forward about three yards in the drive, facing the road, but stopped the car when he realised he had forgotten his glasses. He left the engine running as he went to fetch them. As he returned to the house somebody shouted that the car was moving. \"I went to get back but it was moving too quickly. I got hold of the door but could not open it. The car went through the fence and tipped into the river.\" His son-in-law, Ian Henderson, battled to free Sarah from the back seat. \"He was half out of the car as it floated out about 12ft. Then the current turned it over, and it continued to float downstream.\" Sarah's mother, Mary, a doctor, swam out to the car, said Mr Dumbrell. \"She went to the offside door, and Ian was trying to get to the back door to save his daughter. At this point the car started to sink.\" As it went out of sight Mrs Henderson helped her husband back to the bank, where a crowd was gathering. Mr Dumbrell said: \"There was a group of people trying to get a boat started. I ran back to the house and phoned an ambulance before running back to try to start my own boat.\" The inquest heard that the car was not located for several hours, and efforts by doctors and paramedics to resuscitate Sarah failed. Mr Henderson, a civil servant, told the inquest: \"I managed to get out, but it was not possible to get my daughter out. She was strapped into the middle seat, and it was impossible to get across to her and release her.\" The inquest heard that the Mercedes, which had done 39,000 miles, had a parking brake operated by a foot pedal and released by a lever. A traffic investigator, PC David Pendleton, said the car had been serviced last July and there was \"nothing apparently wrong\". The brakes were \"sufficiently operative\". He added: \"While the engine is cold the automatic choke would operate and would tend to drive the car forward. However, if it is on a very slight incline under normal circumstances, for example waiting at traffic lights, it would need an application of the accelerator to drive it forward.\" He said once the car had started to move forward it would have been impossible to apply the parking brake from the passenger seat. A pathologist, Michael Hall, concluded that Sarah, who was a pupil at Henshaw Church of England primary school, died of drowning. Recording the verdict of accidental death, the Surrey coroner, Michael Burgess, said: \"I am sure all of us feel for the family, all generations of the family, and we extend to the family heartfelt condolences on this very sad death.\" Mr and Mrs Henderson have two other daughters, Ruth, four, and Alexandra, 22 months.",

Mapmakers will be asked to end the current confusion of having Hull on the map and Kingston in the index, and ferry, train and air line operators are all being lobbied to go for the single syllable consistently.</p> <p>\"We are not officially changing the name of the city,\" said Hull's marketing director, John Till, aware of the strength of tradition in Yorkshire, \"but in developing a brand, we have to focus on one name to avoid confusion.\"</p> <p>The Labour council's advisers, Wolff Olins of London, whose creations include Orange and First Direct, insisted clarity was needed before regeneration projects could succeed.</p> <p>The uncluttered name will be blazoned on approaches to the city with a logo, already nicknamed the \"cog\" or \"petal\", which shows a circle with five stumps leading off it, on a background of olive, tan and pastel colours. Marketing text will focus on five rather more cumbersome words: leading, creating, challenging, discovering and innovating, which will precis into the new Hull motto of \"pioneering\".</p> <p>\"The word Hull itself has no particular branding quality,\" said Aidan Kirby, of Wolff Olins, conscious that linguists are divided on whether it comes from an Old Scandinavian word meaning \"deep river\" or the Celtic term for \"muddy one\". Before Edward I renamed Hull as Kingston in 1293, it was known as Wyke on Hull, from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning \"village\".</p> <p>Hull's relative obscurity in modern times, especially following the decline of deep sea fishing, hides a lustrous history of battles and sieges, and celebrated locals such as William Wilberforce, Amy Johnson and Andrew Marvell. The city is also famous for the white telephone kiosks of its locally-owned phone service, perversely known nowadays as Kingston Communications.</p> <p>Once the Hull brand has sunk in, the council plans to press ahead with 29 regeneration projects, including an after-school children's university and a \u00a337.7m ocean discovery centre designed by the architect Terry Farrell.</p> <p>Ambitions beyond that appear even more vaulting; Mr Till told last night's gathering: \"We need to alter the DNA of Hull to make ourselves one of the country's top 10 cities.\"</p> <p><b>Downside of going uptown</b></p> <p>Harrogate is soon to become Harrogate Spa, in honour of its chalybeate springs, which attracted three queens one night in 1912. The spa complex is being renovated</p> <p>Saffron Walden sounded a lot grander than Chipping Walden, Essex, to 14th century burghers who changed the name to honour the growing of saffron crocuses for the medicinal market. The trade died in 1768.</p> <p>Rugeley in Staffordshire petitioned to change its name in 1855 because of Victorian poisoner William Rugeley. It backed down when the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, gave permission - on condition the town was renamed after him.</p> <p>Buxworth in Derbyshire began as Bugsworth, and local purists have long resented the Victorian name change. But a move to restore the original, put to a referendum last year, was firmly voted down.</p>",

The city's marketing department last night announced a new, re-branded era, with people learning to call their home simply Hull. Mapmakers will be asked to end the current confusion of having Hull on the map and Kingston in the index, and ferry, train and air line operators are all being lobbied to go for the single syllable consistently. \"We are not officially changing the name of the city,\" said Hull's marketing director, John Till, aware of the strength of tradition in Yorkshire, \"but in developing a brand, we have to focus on one name to avoid confusion.\" The Labour council's advisers, Wolff Olins of London, whose creations include Orange and First Direct, insisted clarity was needed before regeneration projects could succeed. The uncluttered name will be blazoned on approaches to the city with a logo, already nicknamed the \"cog\" or \"petal\", which shows a circle with five stumps leading off it, on a background of olive, tan and pastel colours. Marketing text will focus on five rather more cumbersome words: leading, creating, challenging, discovering and innovating, which will precis into the new Hull motto of \"pioneering\". \"The word Hull itself has no particular branding quality,\" said Aidan Kirby, of Wolff Olins, conscious that linguists are divided on whether it comes from an Old Scandinavian word meaning \"deep river\" or the Celtic term for \"muddy one\". Before Edward I renamed Hull as Kingston in 1293, it was known as Wyke on Hull, from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning \"village\". Hull's relative obscurity in modern times, especially following the decline of deep sea fishing, hides a lustrous history of battles and sieges, and celebrated locals such as William Wilberforce, Amy Johnson and Andrew Marvell. The city is also famous for the white telephone kiosks of its locally-owned phone service, perversely known nowadays as Kingston Communications. Once the Hull brand has sunk in, the council plans to press ahead with 29 regeneration projects, including an after-school children's university and a \u00a337.7m ocean discovery centre designed by the architect Terry Farrell. Ambitions beyond that appear even more vaulting; Mr Till told last night's gathering: \"We need to alter the DNA of Hull to make ourselves one of the country's top 10 cities.\" Downside of going uptown Harrogate is soon to become Harrogate Spa, in honour of its chalybeate springs, which attracted three queens one night in 1912. The spa complex is being renovated Saffron Walden sounded a lot grander than Chipping Walden, Essex, to 14th century burghers who changed the name to honour the growing of saffron crocuses for the medicinal market. The trade died in 1768. Rugeley in Staffordshire petitioned to change its name in 1855 because of Victorian poisoner William Rugeley. It backed down when the prime minister, Lord Palmerston, gave permission - on condition the town was renamed after him. Buxworth in Derbyshire began as Bugsworth, and local purists have long resented the Victorian name change. But a move to restore the original, put to a referendum last year, was firmly voted down.",

The Science Museum in Kensington, west London, launched a nationwide search today for men and women prepared to undergo scientific tests to establish their identity - in every possible way. They will be photographed nude. They will have their heads examined by brain scanners, and their DNA sequenced and put on display. Their fingerprints, tongue prints and lip prints will be taken and their heart patterns and family trees will be traced. Their body odour, iris patterns, hand and vein geometry will be measured. Their hair and their personalities will be analysed, and their faces will be morphed to show how they will age. Finally, they - and their video identities - will talk to millions of visitors to the new \u00a350m Wellcome wing of the Science Museum when it opens on June 27. When the wing was announced six years ago, it was dubbed a show case for science that had yet to be discovered.

Standing within yards of the statue of his hero Edward Carson, the firebrand Unionist won loud cheers from the crowd as he berated the government for betraying the province. Veterans of the last power-sharing executive, which was brought down by Mr Paisley in 1974, could have been forgiven for despairing at such a sight. A quarter of a century later, however, Mr Paisley attracted support from across the political spectrum, including leading members of Sinn Fein, who nodded their approval as he spoke out in favour of Northern Ireland farmers. The rally on Tuesday, which was overshadowed by frantic efforts to save the peace process, provided a powerful illustration of the extraordinary changes in Northern Ireland in the past year. Since direct rule was ended in December, Sinn Fein and unionist ministers have been quietly cooperating in government in an unprecedented way. Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness has won widespread praise for his sensitivity as education minister, while the Democratic Unionist hardliner Peter Robinson has impressed opponents with his grasp of detail as planning minister. Only last week Mr Robinson made a rare foray into the staunchly nationalist area of Toome in Co Antrim to open a bypass. Optimists hope the success of the power-sharing executive will eventually convince Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to bury their differences and return to their joint work on bread and butter issues. Such hopes appeared to be remote last night as the threat of suspension hung over the power-sharing executive. Dublin was working hard last night to prevent the restoration of direct rule by persuading the IRA to make an 11th hour gesture on disarmament. Without such a move London knows it will have no choice but to suspend the executive - to preserve the position of David Trimble as first minister - thereby ending any chance of IRA disarmament. The familiar stench of deadlock means that Northern Ireland is likely to be heading towards a long period of shadow-boxing. All sides know in their hearts, however, that there will only ever be one show in town: power-sharing in Northern Ireland buttressed by cross-border links with the Irish Republic. Paul Bew, professor of Irish politics at Queen's university, Belfast, said last night: \"The inclusive model of government, bringing in the former extremists, is so deeply embedded that another solution is simply not on.\" The American press yesterday poured scorn on republicans. Even the Washington Post, which is usually more sympathetic to Sinn Fein than the unionists, had an unequivocal message for republicans. \"The IRA's leaders need to know that their allies in this country will not indulge them if they break up the peace process,\" it said. Unfortunately for Mr Trimble, Sinn Fein leaders are not afraid of falling foul of American opinion. \"Never forget that we always think long term and have never been afraid to give the appearance of slitting our own throats,\" one republican said. If the IRA refuses to disarm, Mr Trimble will hope to persuade the SDLP to form a power-sharing executive with the Ulster Unionists, Mr Paisley's DUP and the non-sectarian Alliance Party, but excluding Sinn Fein. Again, this will be impossible. The entire strategy of the SDLP leader, John Hume, has been based on binding Sinn Fein into the political process in the hope that the IRA will eventually wither. There are also electoral considerations for the SDLP: excluding Sinn Fein would massively boost republican support at Mr Hume's expense. The bleak future facing Northern Ireland was spelt out by Tim Pat Coogan, the author of an authoritative book on the IRA, who believes the provisionals will never disarm if the executive is suspended. \"Republicans feel as if they have been travelling in a car at 100mph which has suddenly been put into reverse without going through neutral,\" he said. \"You can imagine what damage that would do to the car.\" One Unionist observer said yesterday that both sides would have to be prepared to give ground.

In his first Commons appearance as Gordon Brown's opposite, Mr Portillo surprised Labour, the Liberal Democrats - and most Tory MPs - with the policy u-turn.

The unexpected announcements signal Mr Portillo's determination to take a firm grip of Tory economic policy. Although senior Tories spent most of the 1990s predicting that the minimum wage would cost up to 2m low-paid jobs, many had recently felt trapped by the party's opposition, believing it would be difficult to campaign in the election on the basis of wanting to take up to 2m workers' pay rises away. Mr Portillo's statement came amid the ritual knockabout at pre-lunch Thursday question time. \"I want to tell the House today that the next Conservative government will respect the independence of the Bank of England and legislate to enhance that independence and create more accountability of the bank to parliament,\" Mr Portillo told MPs. He added: \"And I want to tell this house that the next Conservative government will not repeal the national minimum wage.\" As delighted Labour MPs waved their order papers, Mr Brown welcomed \"the conversion of the Conservative party to Labour party policy\".

Mr Portillo, then the employment secretary, warned: \"A minimum wage would push up inflation and could cost over a million jobs. \"For a great many workers it would replace modest pay with no pay.\" The statement was headed: \"A minimum wage could cost a million jobs, says Portillo.\" About face: \"I think the minimum wage is a truly immoral policy.

      "body": "<p>Michael Howard should be spinning in his political grave at yesterday's sight of his party's new treasury spokesman, Michael Portillo, signing the Tories up for the national minimum wage.</p> <p>The former employment secretary spent years trying to chill voters' blood with the cost of Labour's commitment to such a hare-brained concept. A \"job destruction policy\" that could put 2m low paid workers out of their jobs, he warned in 1991.</p> <p>One of the shadow ministers he drove to distraction was a young thruster called Blair. But this was one controversial Labour policy to which the future prime minister stuck tenaciously with the result that 1.5m workers - mostly women, half of them part-timers - benefited when the national minimum wage (NMW) came into force on April 1 last year.</p> <p>Far from cutting a swathe through the employability of unskilled workers - as, in an unguarded moment, even John Prescott once admitted that it might - it has hardly hurt them at all.</p> <p>There is an explanation for that: Labour's cautious, consensual approach to the issue which involved both unions and managements giving evidence to the low pay commission chaired by Professor George Bain. Set at a modest \u00a33.60 an hour and \u00a33.20 for the 18-21 group (a late sop to the business lobby), it disappointed unions and rapidly became something the CBI now says it has \"learned to live with\" because of its \"prudent\" level. There were no regional variations or special deals for particular industrial sectors, no linkage to inflation or average wages, no promise even of an annual appraisal or uprating. The Bain commission's latest modest report (still not published) is about lowering the adult age threshold from 22 to 21.</p> <p>All the same, as recently as January 20, the shadow DTI spokesman, Angela Browning, referred to it as one of the \"horrors\" Labour had imposed on business. But there were already signs that the Tories were bending on the minium wage, despite William Hague's gut hostility.</p> <p>The Tory leader had not appointed a commission (as he had on the Bank) to pave the way for a U-turn. But John Redwood, once an implaccable foe, was privately saying that Tory opposition had successfully bullied ministers into setting the low \u00a33.60 rate and it was now safe to accept it.</p> <p>Aides would not say yesterday whether the sudden Portillo move was already planned by Francis Maude whose place he took as shadow chancellor. They said Mr Portillo consulted with William Hague and implied he took the bull by the horns himself - much as Mr Brown set free the Bank of England within days of taking office in 1997.</p> <p>Even the US, bastion of capitalism, has had a minimum wage since the 30s. Britain had wages councils from 1909 to 1993 when John Major abolished the vestiges of what Winston Churchill had introduced. Labour has backed a minimum wage in theory since 1919.</p> <p>So is Mr Howard, himself a maximum wage QC, ashamed of his exaggerated talk? Is the relentlessly free-market Institute of Directors, or the CBI which also made alarmist claims? Yesterday none was rushing to the TV studios to eat humble pie.</p> <p>Nor was Mr Portillo exactly. After the new shadow chancellor had surprised MPs by using his first spat with Gordon Brown across the Commons dispatch box to announce the twin policy U-turn (he no longer opposes operational independence for the Bank of England either) he issued a brief statement to reporters.</p> <p>\"We do not think that the NMW is a well-targeted device for the relief of poverty. But at the modest level at which it has been set by the government, the NMW has caused less damage to employment than we feared.

      "bodyText": "Michael Howard should be spinning in his political grave at yesterday's sight of his party's new treasury spokesman, Michael Portillo, signing the Tories up for the national minimum wage. The former employment secretary spent years trying to chill voters' blood with the cost of Labour's commitment to such a hare-brained concept. A \"job destruction policy\" that could put 2m low paid workers out of their jobs, he warned in 1991. One of the shadow ministers he drove to distraction was a young thruster called Blair. But this was one controversial Labour policy to which the future prime minister stuck tenaciously with the result that 1.5m workers - mostly women, half of them part-timers - benefited when the national minimum wage (NMW) came into force on April 1 last year. Far from cutting a swathe through the employability of unskilled workers - as, in an unguarded moment, even John Prescott once admitted that it might - it has hardly hurt them at all. There is an explanation for that: Labour's cautious, consensual approach to the issue which involved both unions and managements giving evidence to the low pay commission chaired by Professor George Bain. Set at a modest \u00a33.60 an hour and \u00a33.20 for the 18-21 group (a late sop to the business lobby), it disappointed unions and rapidly became something the CBI now says it has \"learned to live with\" because of its \"prudent\" level. There were no regional variations or special deals for particular industrial sectors, no linkage to inflation or average wages, no promise even of an annual appraisal or uprating. The Bain commission's latest modest report (still not published) is about lowering the adult age threshold from 22 to 21. All the same, as recently as January 20, the shadow DTI spokesman, Angela Browning, referred to it as one of the \"horrors\" Labour had imposed on business. But there were already signs that the Tories were bending on the minium wage, despite William Hague's gut hostility. The Tory leader had not appointed a commission (as he had on the Bank) to pave the way for a U-turn. But John Redwood, once an implaccable foe, was privately saying that Tory opposition had successfully bullied ministers into setting the low \u00a33.60 rate and it was now safe to accept it. Aides would not say yesterday whether the sudden Portillo move was already planned by Francis Maude whose place he took as shadow chancellor. They said Mr Portillo consulted with William Hague and implied he took the bull by the horns himself - much as Mr Brown set free the Bank of England within days of taking office in 1997. Even the US, bastion of capitalism, has had a minimum wage since the 30s. Britain had wages councils from 1909 to 1993 when John Major abolished the vestiges of what Winston Churchill had introduced. Labour has backed a minimum wage in theory since 1919. So is Mr Howard, himself a maximum wage QC, ashamed of his exaggerated talk? Is the relentlessly free-market Institute of Directors, or the CBI which also made alarmist claims? Yesterday none was rushing to the TV studios to eat humble pie. Nor was Mr Portillo exactly. After the new shadow chancellor had surprised MPs by using his first spat with Gordon Brown across the Commons dispatch box to announce the twin policy U-turn (he no longer opposes operational independence for the Bank of England either) he issued a brief statement to reporters. \"We do not think that the NMW is a well-targeted device for the relief of poverty. But at the modest level at which it has been set by the government, the NMW has caused less damage to employment than we feared. We remain concerned about compliance costs for business and we will seek to improve its administration,\" he explained. Beneath the routine bluster of the political trade lies an important concession: Mr Portillo has cut the cackle and hints of the Hague shadow cabinet and made the necessary adjustment to political reality. Labour would have hammered the Tories over the NMW at the coming election. Now there is only Conservative opposition to Mr Brown's New Deal and his Working Families Tax Credit to hammer. The Tories still dislike both as costly and ineffectual, and promise to \"reform\" them. Like the minimum wage, all are part of the chancellor's drive to make work profitable and attractive for low-paid working families, his closet socialism which seeks to shift resources to the poorest without upsetting the Daily Mail. Mr Portillo's aides say that the NMW still has implications for jobs and that \"exploitation at slave labour rates has never been our policy\". They also warn that compliance costs - monitoring and enforcing the NMW in small or dodgy firms - is expensive, a further burden to add to the cost of the EU's social chapter. In reality, the NMW was set low enough not to threaten the jobs of marginal workers at a time of economic boom when even McDonalds is paying \u00a35 an hour in prosperous southern towns. That may change if the unions succeed in bumping up the rate to half the median wage, around \u00a34.60 an hour, the sort of target which Neil Kinnock promised before the 1992 election. It is unlikely to happen easily, though the pressure will remain as long as the economy keeps growing - even in vulnerable regions and industries. But what Mr Portillo did yesterday was the sort of thing messrs Blair and Brown, Kinnock and Smith before them, were doing for 10 years before they regained power - throwing discredited dogmas, bloated sacred cows and the rest over the side of the ship. They have a long way to go. According to a cartoon in yesterday's Times the ship is still called the Titanic.",

      "body": "<p>To avoid the dread of a 17-ton astronomy satellite tumbling at random out of the sky, Nasa is considering sending it on a controlled suicide dive over the Pacific in March. </p> <p>The 9-year-old Compton Gamma Ray Observatory is still on a scientific par with the newly mended Hubble Space Telescope despite the failure of one of three gyroscopes in December. </p> <p>But Nasa isn't sure whether the Compton Observatory can function in orbit if another gyroscope breaks. And with 1-in-1,000 odds of such a big, out-of-control satellite hurting or killing someone, Nasa is loath to take any chances. </p> <p>So engineers are scrambling to determine, by mid-February, whether Compton can manage with just one gyroscope for pointing. If one gyroscope is enough, the spacecraft will continue, perhaps for several more years, to collect gamma rays from such hot, violent objects as quasars, pulsars, supernova explosions and the areas surrounding black holes. </p> <p>If not, ground controllers will use Compton's two remaining gyroscopes to guide the observatory down through the atmosphere over an empty stretch of the Pacific Ocean sometime around March 14. </p> <p>Pieces that survive the fiery plunge will rain over an area estimated at 16 miles (26 kilometres) wide by 964 miles (1,550 kilometres) long, says Preston Burch, deputy program manager for space science operations at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Ships and planes would be warned to stay away. </p> <p>Without a controlled re-entry, the debris could slam down anywhere between 28.5 degrees north and 28.5 degrees south of the equator. Bangkok, Calcutta, Mexico City, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, even Miami would be vulnerable. </p> <p>\"I'm sitting here looking at a map,\" says Burch, \"and there are vast regions of South America and Africa, the whole northern half of Australia, most of India, a chunk of China and Southeast Asia, Mexico, all of our Central American friends. They sure would not appreciate that.\" </p> <p>Statisticians have based the odds of the satellite coming down, in part, on Skylab's demise. The 78-ton Skylab, Nasa's first space station, came crashing down in 1979. Debris fell into the Indian Ocean and onto western Australia, but no one was hurt and nothing was damaged. </p> <p>It was essentially a free-fall, with only some minor steering possible by ground controllers. </p> <p>\"We don't need another Skylab,\" Burch says with a laugh. </p> <p>If Compton were to come down on its own, the free-fall would occur three to 11 years from now, says Burch. The timing would depend on the density of the upper atmosphere; an intense solar cycle would increase the density and put more drag on the spacecraft, hastening its end. </p> <p>Unlike the much more expensive Hubble, the $600 million Compton was not built for servicing by astronauts even though it's in a 317-mile (510-kilometer)-high orbit, easily reachable by the space shuttle. As a result, Nasa planned for Compton's suicide dive from the start, stockpiling enough fuel on board for a controlled re-entry. </p> <p>Hubble was the first of Nasa's so-called Great Observatories, launched in 1990 to observe celestial objects mainly in visible light. Compton was the second, carried up by space shuttle Atlantis in 1991 to probe the universe for powerful gamma rays. </p> <p>The third in the series, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, was launched in July aboard space shuttle Columbia. The fourth and final Great Observatory, which will examine the universe in the infrared, is targeted for a 2001 lift-off. </p> <p>Already, Compton has proven a complete success: The mission was intended to last two years and the observatory eight years. \"That it's work done,\" Burch says proudly, \"so everything after that is gravy.\" </p> <p>The gyroscope that shut down December 6 had an electronic failure and it's difficult to predict when, or if, another gyroscope might go, says Burch. Hubble also experienced gyroscope breakdowns last year, but the units were different from those on Compton and were replaced by space-walking astronauts just last month. </p> <p>Despite Compton's astronaut-unfriendly design, Nasa is looking into the possibility, however slight, of sending a space shuttle crew to the observatory's rescue. The question is cost and risk vs. scientific return, says Burch. </p> <p>The observatory is loaded with toxic hydrazine fuel, and there is concern about a potentially leaky valve. </p> <p>Burch says he doesn't give a repair mission, a la Hubble, much of a chance. \"But on the other hand,\" he adds, \"we don't want to leave any stone unturned.\" </p> <p>Another possibility would be for astronauts to bring the Compton Observatory back for museum display, or for astronauts to attach a thruster to boost the spacecraft to a higher, longer-lasting orbit. Both these options are also long shots, says Burch. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of mixed emotions,\" he says. \"On the one hand, we certainly don't want anybody hurt. But it's a tremendous accomplishment of human ingenuity to have created a marvellous spacecraft, so to see it come to an end is sad.\"</p>",

Ships and planes would be warned to stay away. Without a controlled re-entry, the debris could slam down anywhere between 28.5 degrees north and 28.5 degrees south of the equator. Bangkok, Calcutta, Mexico City, Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, even Miami would be vulnerable. \"I'm sitting here looking at a map,\" says Burch, \"and there are vast regions of South America and Africa, the whole northern half of Australia, most of India, a chunk of China and Southeast Asia, Mexico, all of our Central American friends. They sure would not appreciate that.\" Statisticians have based the odds of the satellite coming down, in part, on Skylab's demise. The 78-ton Skylab, Nasa's first space station, came crashing down in 1979. Debris fell into the Indian Ocean and onto western Australia, but no one was hurt and nothing was damaged. It was essentially a free-fall, with only some minor steering possible by ground controllers. \"We don't need another Skylab,\" Burch says with a laugh. If Compton were to come down on its own, the free-fall would occur three to 11 years from now, says Burch. The timing would depend on the density of the upper atmosphere; an intense solar cycle would increase the density and put more drag on the spacecraft, hastening its end. Unlike the much more expensive Hubble, the $600 million Compton was not built for servicing by astronauts even though it's in a 317-mile (510-kilometer)-high orbit, easily reachable by the space shuttle. As a result, Nasa planned for Compton's suicide dive from the start, stockpiling enough fuel on board for a controlled re-entry. Hubble was the first of Nasa's so-called Great Observatories, launched in 1990 to observe celestial objects mainly in visible light. Compton was the second, carried up by space shuttle Atlantis in 1991 to probe the universe for powerful gamma rays. The third in the series, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, was launched in July aboard space shuttle Columbia. The fourth and final Great Observatory, which will examine the universe in the infrared, is targeted for a 2001 lift-off. Already, Compton has proven a complete success: The mission was intended to last two years and the observatory eight years. \"That it's work done,\" Burch says proudly, \"so everything after that is gravy.\" The gyroscope that shut down December 6 had an electronic failure and it's difficult to predict when, or if, another gyroscope might go, says Burch. Hubble also experienced gyroscope breakdowns last year, but the units were different from those on Compton and were replaced by space-walking astronauts just last month. Despite Compton's astronaut-unfriendly design, Nasa is looking into the possibility, however slight, of sending a space shuttle crew to the observatory's rescue. The question is cost and risk vs. scientific return, says Burch. The observatory is loaded with toxic hydrazine fuel, and there is concern about a potentially leaky valve. Burch says he doesn't give a repair mission, a la Hubble, much of a chance. \"But on the other hand,\" he adds, \"we don't want to leave any stone unturned.\" Another possibility would be for astronauts to bring the Compton Observatory back for museum display, or for astronauts to attach a thruster to boost the spacecraft to a higher, longer-lasting orbit. Both these options are also long shots, says Burch. \"There are a lot of mixed emotions,\" he says. \"On the one hand, we certainly don't want anybody hurt. But it's a tremendous accomplishment of human ingenuity to have created a marvellous spacecraft, so to see it come to an end is sad.\"",

He survived the postwar collapse of the industry, and US senate hearings which sought to link juvenile delinquency to comics. In the 1960s, he was critical of the quality of comic-book writing, and struck out in the new directions of self-publishing and graphic novels, trying to broaden the scope of comics, which, by the 1970s, were dominated once again by costumed heroes.</p> <p>Tall and distinguished, Kane was a popular figure at comic conventions, knowledgeable, wry and honest.

      "bodyText": "Gil Kane, (Eli Katz), illustrator, born April 6 1926; died January 31 2000. Although he will long be remembered for his part in the reinvention of comic-book superheroes in the 1960s - and the revival of Green Lantern and The Atom - Gil Kane, who has died aged 73, was a creator who worked in the mainstream to improve the medium he loved. His career spanned the history of the American comic book from 1942, only four years after the arrival of Superman. He survived the postwar collapse of the industry, and US senate hearings which sought to link juvenile delinquency to comics. In the 1960s, he was critical of the quality of comic-book writing, and struck out in the new directions of self-publishing and graphic novels, trying to broaden the scope of comics, which, by the 1970s, were dominated once again by costumed heroes. Tall and distinguished, Kane was a popular figure at comic conventions, knowledgeable, wry and honest. He was the first to admit that his early work was not that good. His best facility was speed, pencilling six to 10 pages of artwork a week; it was perfect for a production-line industry but was starved of creativity. He learned from the best artists around him - Lou Fine, Reed Crandall, Jack Kirby and Alex Toth - and evolved a style that married their design with dynamism.

Joaquin Balaguer, once the right-hand man of the notorious dictator Rafael Trujillo, has announced that he intends to contest the Caribbean country's forthcoming election, his 10th presidential campaign. The Dominican Republic - where 8m people live on an average yearly wage of only $2,000 (\u00a31,245) - is already gripped by election fever, even though the country does not go to the polls until May 16. As his die-hard supporters brandish the red flags of Mr Balaguer's Reformista party and chant his name, it seems the patriarch may yet decide the future of his country. His opponents fear that his resurrection would put an end to moves towards reform under the current president, Leonel Fernandez, pointing to the activities of La Banda, a paramilitary group which killed hundreds of activists during Mr Balaguer's rule in the 1960s and 1970s.

Washington suspects the vessel was smuggling Iraqi oil in breach of UN sanctions, but Moscow insists it was transporting Iranian fuel oil to the United Arab Emirates. \"Russia insists that the tanker be instantly released,\" said Russia's deputy foreign minister responsible for the Middle East, Vasily Sredin. A spokesman for the Russian transport ministry said: \"The word Iraq does not crop up in any of the documents.\" Furious at the interception of the Russian vessel only hours after the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, ended a three-day visit to Moscow, senior Russian officials lodged complaints in Washington and Abu Dhabi while summoning US diplomats to the foreign ministry in Moscow. Relations between the US and Russia are at their coolest since the 1980s. Mr Sredin said the vessel, apparently stopped by the Americans for the second time in a week, had not entered Iraqi waters or any Iraqi port.

La Repubblica newspaper suggested he will go as far as to apologise for the failure to resist the Nazis, but without implicating Pope Pius XII, who has been accused of ignoring the holocaust during the second world war.

Some initiatives have backfired, said Margaret Hebblethwaite, a theologian and Vatican expert. \"Most were not apologies at all. He told the Jews that terrible things had happened to them but that it wasn't the church's fault. Many Jews were hurt by that. I welcome the apology that's coming, but suspect it won't go far enough.\" In a separate development, the Vatican last night advanced the partial rehabilitation of Giordano Bruno, a Dominican priest burned at the stake 400 years ago this month for challenging orthodoxy, including the immaculate conception. The investigating Cardinal, Paul Poupard, said the church was wrong to execute Bruno but right to reject his heresies.",

      "standfirst": "New Labour is gearing up for the next election with a raft of unlikely new candidates who a decade ago would have been happier canvassing for the Tories. And perhaps the strangest of this new breed is the former Tory MP Alan Amos, who was once anti-abortion and pro-flogging.  <B>Sally Weale</B> profiles Millbank's next wave of hopefuls",
      "trailText": "A little over 10 years ago, Alan Amos advocated flogging for rapists and muggers. He believed in birching in schools; he was vehemently anti-abortion (he was a member of SPUC, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child) and he bitterly opposed embryo experimentation.",

      "body": "<p>A little over 10 years ago, Alan Amos advocated flogging for rapists and muggers. He believed in birching in schools; he was vehemently anti-abortion (he was a member of SPUC, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child) and he bitterly opposed embryo experimentation.</p> <p>For five years he was Tory MP for the Northumbrian constituency of Hexham; Andrew Roth's book of parliamentary profiles described him at the time as \"an abortion-obsessed bachelor\"; ambitious, orthodox and right wing. An anti-smoking teetotaller, Amos served under Thatcher and Major and was once found to be the fourth hardest working MP in the house.</p> <p>Today, he is a candidate for Labour - one of 700 members approved by Millbank and hoping to stand at the next general election for a seat in the House of Commons. Amos is perhaps the most unlikely of Labour candidates out of a list which includes individuals who, a decade ago, would have been regarded as equally unlikely. Among the more traditional Labour activists, the trade unionists and town councillors, there is an adviser to a City bank, a wealthy city accountant and a champion of small business - the list, commentators say, marks a swing to business and the right. The newly Labourite Amos is at least in familiar company.</p> <p>That Amos is on the Labour Party's list of approved candidates speaks volumes for the personal transformation he has undergone. For him, it was not a case of shifting a few inches from one side of the political divide to the other, it was a volte-face. But perhaps it also tells us something about the party which has taken him in and adopted him as one of its candidates. For the Labour Party's transformation under Tony Blair is every bit as radical as that of Alan Amos - as the new breed of would-be Labour MPs illustrates.</p> <p>Alan Amos's face, then, is the face of New Labour - pink, scrubbed, and it used to be the face of the Young Conservatives. Dressed in unremarkable green macintosh, dark suit, blue striped shirt and red tie with galloping donkeys (symbol of the American Democrats), he could belong to any political party. His shoes are polished, his hair freshly cut. He is ill at ease and self-conscious, but he is decidedly on-message.</p> <p>Where once he called for flogging, now he preaches tolerance; no more corporal punishment, now it's social justice; more than a decade ago he named and shamed private gynaecologists carrying out late abortions, last week he was talking about understanding and how we all ought to be less judgmental.</p> <p>The lives of Alan Amos and Tony Blair are curiously interweaved. Amos, 47, first began working for the Tories when he was 14. His parents were presidents of the Hendon Young Conservatives and the young Alan would distribute leaflets for his father who was a councillor in Harpenden for seven years. His political career gathered pace when he was elected president of the Oxford University Conservative Association; he was a contemporary of Blair's at St John's College, where he studied PPE. Blair, Amos remembers, was a popular student.</p> <p>Their political lives flourished despite their tender years - in 1984 Amos became the youngest member on Enfield borough council, before succeeding Sir Geoffrey (later Lord) Rippon in Hexham in 1987. Then, in 1992, shortly before the general election, Amos suffered a fall from grace. He was forced to resign after being arrested and cautioned for alleged indecency on Hampstead Heath. He has always denied being gay and dismisses the incident as \"a silly mistake\".</p> <p>But no matter how airily he might try to shrug it off now, his arrest had a devastating impact on him and his career. Amos lost his faith in the Tory Party, in the police and in the tabloid press. Even today he cannot disguise his contempt and loathing for all three - the party activisits at Hexham who forced him out are \"dreadful people\". The tabloid papers who revelled in his downfall are \"the gutter press\" who print what they like regardless of the truth - he refuses to speak to them now. And he loathes the police with a vengeance.</p> <p>For a year after his demise, Amos worked for John Gummer (\"a very nice man\"), then decided to go travelling for a year to sort himself out. \"The Tory party was going very fast and very far to the right. That process was unstoppable. The Conservative party always has to have a group to hate. Years ago there were the communists. Then there's gays, single mothers - now it's everybody in the European Union. I realised I no longer wanted to be part of a minority-bashing, foreigner-hating party.\"</p> <p>At the same time the Tory party lurched to the right, Amos began to acquire a new sense of social justice. He was impressed by the transformation of the Labour Party under first John Smith and then Tony Blair, and soon his friends began to tell him he sounded more Labour than Tory. In 1994, he became a fully paid-up member of New Labour. It had nothing to do with opportunism - it was \"a very courageous, very difficult decision to make\". \"It's not the case that the Labour party has moved so far to the right it can absorb Tory MPs,\" he insists. No? \"No, my views have changed considerably and genuinely.</p> <p>\"What has changed in me is the fundamental way I look at situations and look at people. I like to think I'm a tolerant, understanding person. In those days I was more judgmental.\"</p> <p>So what about flogging? \"I no longer believe in that,\" says Amos. \"At the time what I thought was if we had a deterrent that would stop a lot of crime. With more deterrent you could stop more crime. I've come to see we should be looking at the causes of these people's problems.\" What about abortion?

      "bodyText": "A little over 10 years ago, Alan Amos advocated flogging for rapists and muggers. He believed in birching in schools; he was vehemently anti-abortion (he was a member of SPUC, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child) and he bitterly opposed embryo experimentation. For five years he was Tory MP for the Northumbrian constituency of Hexham; Andrew Roth's book of parliamentary profiles described him at the time as \"an abortion-obsessed bachelor\"; ambitious, orthodox and right wing. An anti-smoking teetotaller, Amos served under Thatcher and Major and was once found to be the fourth hardest working MP in the house. Today, he is a candidate for Labour - one of 700 members approved by Millbank and hoping to stand at the next general election for a seat in the House of Commons. Amos is perhaps the most unlikely of Labour candidates out of a list which includes individuals who, a decade ago, would have been regarded as equally unlikely. Among the more traditional Labour activists, the trade unionists and town councillors, there is an adviser to a City bank, a wealthy city accountant and a champion of small business - the list, commentators say, marks a swing to business and the right. The newly Labourite Amos is at least in familiar company. That Amos is on the Labour Party's list of approved candidates speaks volumes for the personal transformation he has undergone. For him, it was not a case of shifting a few inches from one side of the political divide to the other, it was a volte-face. But perhaps it also tells us something about the party which has taken him in and adopted him as one of its candidates. For the Labour Party's transformation under Tony Blair is every bit as radical as that of Alan Amos - as the new breed of would-be Labour MPs illustrates. Alan Amos's face, then, is the face of New Labour - pink, scrubbed, and it used to be the face of the Young Conservatives. Dressed in unremarkable green macintosh, dark suit, blue striped shirt and red tie with galloping donkeys (symbol of the American Democrats), he could belong to any political party. His shoes are polished, his hair freshly cut. He is ill at ease and self-conscious, but he is decidedly on-message. Where once he called for flogging, now he preaches tolerance; no more corporal punishment, now it's social justice; more than a decade ago he named and shamed private gynaecologists carrying out late abortions, last week he was talking about understanding and how we all ought to be less judgmental. The lives of Alan Amos and Tony Blair are curiously interweaved. Amos, 47, first began working for the Tories when he was 14. His parents were presidents of the Hendon Young Conservatives and the young Alan would distribute leaflets for his father who was a councillor in Harpenden for seven years. His political career gathered pace when he was elected president of the Oxford University Conservative Association; he was a contemporary of Blair's at St John's College, where he studied PPE. Blair, Amos remembers, was a popular student. Their political lives flourished despite their tender years - in 1984 Amos became the youngest member on Enfield borough council, before succeeding Sir Geoffrey (later Lord) Rippon in Hexham in 1987. Then, in 1992, shortly before the general election, Amos suffered a fall from grace. He was forced to resign after being arrested and cautioned for alleged indecency on Hampstead Heath. He has always denied being gay and dismisses the incident as \"a silly mistake\". But no matter how airily he might try to shrug it off now, his arrest had a devastating impact on him and his career. Amos lost his faith in the Tory Party, in the police and in the tabloid press. Even today he cannot disguise his contempt and loathing for all three - the party activisits at Hexham who forced him out are \"dreadful people\". The tabloid papers who revelled in his downfall are \"the gutter press\" who print what they like regardless of the truth - he refuses to speak to them now. And he loathes the police with a vengeance. For a year after his demise, Amos worked for John Gummer (\"a very nice man\"), then decided to go travelling for a year to sort himself out. \"The Tory party was going very fast and very far to the right. That process was unstoppable. The Conservative party always has to have a group to hate. Years ago there were the communists. Then there's gays, single mothers - now it's everybody in the European Union. I realised I no longer wanted to be part of a minority-bashing, foreigner-hating party.\" At the same time the Tory party lurched to the right, Amos began to acquire a new sense of social justice. He was impressed by the transformation of the Labour Party under first John Smith and then Tony Blair, and soon his friends began to tell him he sounded more Labour than Tory. In 1994, he became a fully paid-up member of New Labour. It had nothing to do with opportunism - it was \"a very courageous, very difficult decision to make\". \"It's not the case that the Labour party has moved so far to the right it can absorb Tory MPs,\" he insists. No? \"No, my views have changed considerably and genuinely. \"What has changed in me is the fundamental way I look at situations and look at people. I like to think I'm a tolerant, understanding person. In those days I was more judgmental.\" So what about flogging? \"I no longer believe in that,\" says Amos. \"At the time what I thought was if we had a deterrent that would stop a lot of crime. With more deterrent you could stop more crime. I've come to see we should be looking at the causes of these people's problems.\" What about abortion? He's no longer a member of SPUC but seems uncomfortable talking about his old hobby horse. \"In principle, I think it should not be used as a form of birth control. But I think there are cases where people have to make that decision. Clearly in the case of rape, for example.\" He believes life begins at conception but argues that it is not for others to pontificate. \"We need to understand a bit more. When you are faced with a difficult personal situation, you have to make difficult decisions.\" So who are Amos's fellow candidates and what can they tell us about New Labour second time round? Well, women currently make up a third of the approved list, but the NEC fears that few will be selected without some form of positive action. Much more likely to make it onto constituency shortlists are the like of Stephen Alambritis, 42. Alambritis is the highly successful head of press and parliamentary affairs for the Federation of Small Businesses. It is not so long ago that the FSB was regarded as little more than an arm of the Tory Party. \"The natural assumption is that small business is in the Conservative camp,\" he says. \"But that changed at the last election. The votes were up for grabs. The Conservatives had become complacent. They assumed that it would be theirs, but Labour made a big pitch for it. \"Before that we had millions of self-employed people who felt that the Labour Party was not for them - it was for the worker not the boss. But that started to change under John Smith. Then, in 1996, Tony Blair addressed our annual conference in Maidstone.

Perhaps we should be more surprised at the continuing preponderance of traditional Labour candidates on Millbank's approved list - the trade unionists and the local councillors, rather than the businessmen and City types. It's a mixed bag, but what this second generation of Labour hopefuls reflects most vividly - old Tory-New Labour Alan Amos included - is the colossal scale of change during the government's first term in office and hints at what might lie ahead in the second.",

      "body": "<p>Not too many comedies are based on the lives of people who come across as obnoxious, boorish and unappealing because not many people will pay to see them. One subject who at least partly fits this description is the late Jacqueline Susann, celebrated and reviled author of heavy-breathing immorality tales that turned the stuffy publishing business on its ear some 30 years ago. </p> <p>The problem with chronicling the life of Susann - pill addict, cancer sufferer, mother of an autistic son, and gossipy author, who, in reality, could be aggressively overbearing, uncouth, insecure and frequently unpleasant to be around - was coming up with a script and an actor who could convey the brashness and yet manage to keep the character sympathetic, and funny. </p> <p>The makers of Isn't She Great think they found the ideal choice in Bette Midler, who has made a career of being aggressively overbearing and uncouth - and, above all, very funny. In the hands of Midler, Nathan Lane, David Hyde Pierce, John Cleese, Stockard Channing and director Andrew Bergman, the hard-bitten, foul-mouthed and ultimately courageous Susann of Isn't She Great, which opened last week in the US, has become sweeter and funnier than she ever dreamed of being in real life. </p> <p>A visit to the set during filming in Montreal in the summer of 1998 proved instructive. Cultures collide in a scene in which Hyde Pierce's fictional character, buttoned-down editor Michael Hastings, calls on Susann and her doting husband, Irving Mansfield (played by Nathan Lane, best known here for Mouse Hunt), in their palatial apartment overlooking Central Park. </p> <p>\"Mike!\" blurts out Lane, as publicist and producer Mansfield. \"Come in, take a load off. Jackie, it's Mike!\" </p> <p>A hallucination of powder-blue feather marabou and navy blue dressing gown, dangling pink velvet eyeshades, Midler's Jackie bursts out of the bedroom. </p> <p>\"What the hell is wrong with you?\" she bellows. \"It's fucking dawn!\" </p> <p>Hastings gingerly picks his way forward. \"Miss Susann? I'm Michael Hastings, your editor. We have to get to work. I have a great many comprehensive notes.\" </p> <p>\"Notes?\" asks Jackie, bristling. \"Whaddaya mean, notes?\" \"Miss Susann, your manuscript is presently nigh on incoherent,\" Hastings replies. \"And that's bad?\" she asks ingenuously. \"Yes!\" he answers, exploding in exasperation. </p> <p>\"Well, Mr Picky! Buster, you just hold on,\" retorts Jackie, stalking out to change into another of many gloriously psychedelic Pucci concoctions, ready to do battle with the supercilious Connecticut Yankee publisher in Queen Jackie's court. </p> <p>\"Isn't she great?\" chuckles Irving. \"She's so excited. Thrilled. She's never been edited before.\" </p> <p>Cut. Between shots, Hyde Pierce says of his character: \"It's essentially like I've gone to Mars. I have never met people like this. The book that she's trying to publish is a complete mess, and they're talking about what kind of limousines they should be getting and what the cover of the book jacket is going to look like.\" </p> <p>Part wisecracking comedy of manners, part rags-to-riches romance, Paul Rudnick's script captures what Midler calls \"the Ed Sullivan of it all, the Stork Club, El Morocco and Delmonico's, that Broadway life\" that Jackie and Irving lived for. They invented themselves as characters in a Runyonesque universe, holding court in Lindy's delicatessen and other showbiz haunts. </p> <p>With the media now bristling with tell-all confessionals that Jackie's novels helped pioneer, something of a Susann renaissance is in the works. Her books - Valley of the Dolls, The Love Machine and Once is Not Enough, all number one bestsellers in the 60s and 70s - are back in print. In addition to the Universal feature with Midler and Lane, Fox has in development a remake of Valley of the Dolls, with Betty Thomas attached to produce and direct, and USA Network has already aired (in December 1998) a small-screen biopic about Susann starring Michele Lee. </p> <p>Susann couldn't sing, she couldn't act, she couldn't dance, and she tried them all. Many would argue she couldn't construct a plot if her life depended on it, and, in a way, it did. But, boy, could she schmooze. </p> <p>Up at dawn to bring coffee and doughnuts to the Teamsters, Jackie made sure the truck drivers got her books to the bookstores on time. Armed with a Rolodex listing booksellers' names, birthdays, the names of their children and pets, she and Irving toured the country, greeting salespeople like old friends, shamelessly enlisting a loyal following to flog her scandalous, hugely popular potboilers. </p> <p>According to Michael Korda, Susann's post-Valley of the Dolls editor at Simon &amp; Schuster, she reinvented that mainstay of the publishing business, the romance novel, making room for both \"tears and oral sex\", drug-addicted beauties and Hollywood heels, and paving the way for the likes of Danielle Steel, Jackie Collins and Judith Krantz. </p> <p>\"She reinvented the way books were sold, the marketing and packaging, which may or may not be good for the literary establishment, but it was a reality of the changing times,\" explains Mike Lobell, the film's producer. </p> <p>A beauty-contest winner from Philadelphia, Jackie hit New York at age 18, hungry for fame. She was so self-absorbed that when the Japanese had the effrontery to bomb Pearl Harbor during an ill-timed audition, she flew into a rage, incensed that no one was paying any attention to her husky, off-key baritone. She tried modelling, acting, writing plays, appearing in radio and television commercials, and forming a singing group - proving a rousing failure in everything. </p> <p>Ultimately she found her gimmick. Her books sold in unprecedented numbers, film tie-ins were box-office successes and she became a household name. With characteristic gall, she claimed that the 1960s would be remembered for three landmarks: Andy Warhol, the Beatles and Jackie Susann. Yet, by the 80s, the books were out of print and the self-declared icon was remembered vaguely for her big hair, big lips and heavy, raccoon-eye make-up. </p> <p>Had Susann been only a tough-talking, Machiavellian creature of celebrity, she would have proved as one-dimensional as the pill-popping heroines in her novels. She was not. Beneath her carefully constructed illusion of the glamorous high life were two tragedies she kept deeply private. Part of the reason she drove herself so hard to achieve fame was to pay for institutionalising the Mansfields' autistic son, Guy, whose existence she and Irving hid from all but their closest friends. </p> <p>To overcome her depression over Guy, Irving suggested she write a book. Eventually she produced Every Night, Josephine!, a dog's-eye view of life with Jackie. In yet another blow, however, on the eve of the book's publication in 1963, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which, at the time was nearly always a fatal disease. She had mastectomies, underwent radiation therapy that forced her to wear a series of trademark wigs, and became addicted to sedatives, the cause of her slow-motion speech. Not until after her death from the disease in 1974 at 56 did the public learn of her cancer and the existence of the couple's autistic son (who remains institutionalised at an undisclosed facility). </p> <p>\"Her attitude was: 'Who's gonna buy a sexy book from someone who has cancer?' and I think she was right,\" director Bergman explains. </p> <p>While her novels peeled away glamorous facades to reveal her characters' hidden miseries, she felt the same candour about her own suffering was out of the question. \"In an age where people make whole careers about going public about their private lives, it's ironic that someone so bold, flashy, upfront and in-your-face as Jackie was really completely private,\" says Channing, who plays Susann's best friend. </p> <p>\"Jackie and her crowd had a kind of nobility because they kept up a front. They put on the make-up, the hair, they went out into the world and had fun and entertained other people and didn't moan and groan. There was something fabulous about that.\" </p> <p>Based largely on Korda's alternately painful and hilarious account of working with Jackie, published in August 1995 in the New Yorker magazine, the film also draws on background from Irving's own sanitised biography and Barbara Seaman's less than flattering portrait of the Mansfields in Lovely Me. </p> <p>While Rudnick's script sticks closely to anecdotes in the Korda article and from other sources, it is far from purist biography. The film version tones down some of the couple's grasping nastiness and the more sordid details of their life together, skipping Susann's numerous affairs, principally with Borscht Belt comics and, more scandalously, with Ethel Merman. </p> <p>\"Rudnick captures what made their marriage work and concentrates on the most charming aspects of Irving and Jackie, who I think could be a handful in reality and a little less than charming,\" says Lane. Although still brassy enough to fill Carnegie Hall, Midler's Jackie is a far more sympathetic character. \"In reality, Jackie was a tough, foul-mouthed woman and totally controlling,\" says Bergman. \"Bette is a far more bravura kind of personality than Jackie was and has much more humour than she did.\" </p> <p>\"People said things about her that if they had said them about me, I would've just died,\" says Midler. \"She must've had a hide like an elephant.\" </p> <p>It's nearly midnight on the set in Montreal, but the Mansfields are still waiting for breakfast. A punchy Midler and Channing sing Kurt Weill songs between takes to keep themselves alert. </p> <p>When filming resumes, Channing's Flo, a tipsy, blissfully self-centred actress, charges into the room for the seventh time, trailing a fur stole over her pink sequinned dress, her hair staying as defiantly erect as the Chrysler Building in a towering bouffant. \"They fired me!\" she rages. </p> <p>Suddenly, Jackie materialises, wearing a flamboyant Pucci gown, wig curls bobbing. </p> <p>\"Flo!\" brays Jackie. \"Jackie!\" booms Flo, rushing to her, nearly knocking over the bannister from the landing. </p> <p>From offstage, the director yells cut. \"Stockard, you got to her too soon,\" he says. In this double-time ballet, it's a wonder everyone isn't crashing into one another more often. </p> <p>Once again, Flo sweeps in, Jackie flutters in, and, this time, the choreographed blocking runs like clockwork. </p> <p>\"You wanted changes?\" Jackie challenges a dumbfounded Hastings. \"How's this for editing?\" she says, thrusting her head triumphantly to the ceiling, swishing the gown dramatically. </p> <p>\"They fired me,\" Flo repeats. \"They fired ya?\" parrots Jackie, who commiserates, loudly and vulgarly unprintable. </p> <p>Her outburst finished, Jackie pauses to reflect. \"This is wrong. Too subtle,\" she says, looking down dizsapprovingly at her dress, and turns on her heel to change. </p> <p>Ruthless and bereft of talent as this fairytale Jackie is, she may not be great; but there's no doubt that she's an original, right down to her pink IBM Selectric, the insults as colourful as her endless costumes, and her own wacky brand of bygone dignity.</p> <p>\u0095 Isn't She Great opens in the UK on March 31.</p>",

They put on the make-up, the hair, they went out into the world and had fun and entertained other people and didn't moan and groan. There was something fabulous about that.\" Based largely on Korda's alternately painful and hilarious account of working with Jackie, published in August 1995 in the New Yorker magazine, the film also draws on background from Irving's own sanitised biography and Barbara Seaman's less than flattering portrait of the Mansfields in Lovely Me. While Rudnick's script sticks closely to anecdotes in the Korda article and from other sources, it is far from purist biography. The film version tones down some of the couple's grasping nastiness and the more sordid details of their life together, skipping Susann's numerous affairs, principally with Borscht Belt comics and, more scandalously, with Ethel Merman. \"Rudnick captures what made their marriage work and concentrates on the most charming aspects of Irving and Jackie, who I think could be a handful in reality and a little less than charming,\" says Lane. Although still brassy enough to fill Carnegie Hall, Midler's Jackie is a far more sympathetic character. \"In reality, Jackie was a tough, foul-mouthed woman and totally controlling,\" says Bergman. \"Bette is a far more bravura kind of personality than Jackie was and has much more humour than she did.\" \"People said things about her that if they had said them about me, I would've just died,\" says Midler. \"She must've had a hide like an elephant.\" It's nearly midnight on the set in Montreal, but the Mansfields are still waiting for breakfast. A punchy Midler and Channing sing Kurt Weill songs between takes to keep themselves alert. When filming resumes, Channing's Flo, a tipsy, blissfully self-centred actress, charges into the room for the seventh time, trailing a fur stole over her pink sequinned dress, her hair staying as defiantly erect as the Chrysler Building in a towering bouffant. \"They fired me!\" she rages. Suddenly, Jackie materialises, wearing a flamboyant Pucci gown, wig curls bobbing. \"Flo!\" brays Jackie. \"Jackie!\" booms Flo, rushing to her, nearly knocking over the bannister from the landing. From offstage, the director yells cut. \"Stockard, you got to her too soon,\" he says. In this double-time ballet, it's a wonder everyone isn't crashing into one another more often. Once again, Flo sweeps in, Jackie flutters in, and, this time, the choreographed blocking runs like clockwork. \"You wanted changes?\" Jackie challenges a dumbfounded Hastings. \"How's this for editing?\" she says, thrusting her head triumphantly to the ceiling, swishing the gown dramatically. \"They fired me,\" Flo repeats. \"They fired ya?\" parrots Jackie, who commiserates, loudly and vulgarly unprintable. Her outburst finished, Jackie pauses to reflect. \"This is wrong. Too subtle,\" she says, looking down dizsapprovingly at her dress, and turns on her heel to change. Ruthless and bereft of talent as this fairytale Jackie is, she may not be great; but there's no doubt that she's an original, right down to her pink IBM Selectric, the insults as colourful as her endless costumes, and her own wacky brand of bygone dignity. \u0095 Isn't She Great opens in the UK on March 31.",

I'll never forget those moments of sheer physical pleasure. Seeing The Magnificent Seven was a seminal experience for my generation - like first sex, but more fondly remembered now. And for me more important.</p> <p>I'm not sure if it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema, but it is the first I remember seeing. Its images, dialogue and music seared themselves in my memory - Yul Brynner dressed in black, Steve McQueen riding shotgun on the hearse, and James Coburn unwinding himself from his slumbers to accommodate the foolish gunman who thinks he can draw quicker than Coburn can throw his knife. He was wrong. </p> <p>The Playhouse in North Berwick is long gone. But The Magnificent Seven is very much alive, 40 years after it first appeared. It changed the nature of the western, but its influence went way beyond the genre. Without it, there would have been no Bug's Life, which relocated the story in the insect world, and no Westworld, in which tourists were terrorised by Brynner as an out-of-control robot version of his Magnificent Seven character. </p> <p>James Coburn a tall, slim, silver-haired figure in black jeans and blue jumper extends a hand twisted by the arthritis that took 10 years out of his career, and left him unable to walk for 18 months at the start of the 90s, before he managed to alleviate it with dietary sulphur. But his blue eyes sparkle as brightly as ever.</p> <p>\"Forty years,\" he says, in that deep, laconic tone that rumbled across a string of great films in the 60s and 70s, including The Great Escape, Charade and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. He went on making westerns even after the genre's death notice had been published and in the 90s, he was in Young Guns II and Maverick. He survived Hudson Hawk as well as debilitating illness and finally won an Oscar last year for his performance as Nick Nolte's embittered father in Paul Schrader's little-seen drama Affliction. </p> <p>He can work again now, but admits he is very choosy. The Magnificent Seven is an awesome yardstick. \"Is it really 40 years?,\" he wonders as we settle into a booth in Hollywood's Polo Lounge, where multimillion dollar film deals are a part of the routine. It is Coburn's local and a small army of attendants dance attendance.</p> <p>Coburn is now 71. He got the part in The Magnificent Seven, after a chance meeting with Robert Vaughn. Coburn had been a huge fan of Seven Samurai, the 1954 Japanese film on which The Magnificent Seven was based. He was studying with Stella Adler and working in television in New York when he saw Akira Kurosawa's film. \"I hadn't seen a film like that, ever,\" he says \"To see all these characters... the big fight in the rain and the mud... He just blew me away.\" Coburn saw it 15 times. </p> <p>He remembers reading in the trades that Brynner and Anthony Quinn had acquired the rights to remake it as a western in which a bunch of poor Mexican villagers hire seven gunmen from north of the border to protect them from bandits. He was under the impression that the pact had fallen apart and the project was abandoned, until he met Vaughn in the street one day. </p> <p>\"I said 'Hi, man, what are you doing?' And he said 'I'm going to do The Magnificent Seven.' And, like, my heart just fell.\" Shooting was only weeks away and Coburn feared all the parts would be cast. And they were, more or less. Coburn had recently made his film debut as a bounty hunter in Budd Boetticher's western Ride Lonesome and seemed a more natural candidate for the film than Vaughn, whom he had met on the drama course at LA City College. </p> <p>Coburn was born in Nebraska, but his father moved the family to LA during the Depression in pursuit of work. Vaughn came from a very different background. \"He had come up from Minnesota, very erudite, carrying everything in a briefcase. He looked like he was a golf pro... red pants, checkered shirt.\"</p> <p>Vaughn was to play Lee, the southern gent who has lost his nerve. Brynner, McQueen, Charles Bronson, Horst Buchholz and Brad Dexter were also in place. The role of Britt, the most skilled knifeman and gunman of them all, was written as an older man and was destined for either Sterling Hayden, the rangy star of The Asphalt Jungle and Johnny Guitar, or John Ireland, whose western credits included Red River and Gunfight at the OK Corral. </p> <p>Coburn says they were quibbling over money and he managed to set up a meeting with director John Sturges just in case. \"This was on a Friday afternoon and it had to be cast by Saturday night because an actors' strike was going to take place then. Any film that wasn't cast by Saturday midnight, you couldn't do it... He said 'Well,' [Coburn adopts a high, screechy whine of a voice] 'we'll let you know by three o'clock.' And duly I get a call saying 'Well, run over and pick up your knives'... It was a real thrilling gig to get that, because it was a role that I always coveted.\" </p> <p>It took him no time to learn the rudiments of knives. \"I learned how to throw them one afternoon,\" he says, \"and just practised from then on.\" A laugh issues from deep in some subterranean cavern. There were stories of friction from the Mexican location, with one newspaper reporting a feud between the icy Yul Brynner, who had recently won a best-actor Oscar for The King and I, and the volatile Steve McQueen. </p> <p>McQueen had grown up on a farm and was at home with guns and horses, whereas Brynner was a Russian emigrant who felt more comfortable discussing philosophy in sophisticated nightclubs. Legend has it that for one scene Brynner chose to stand on a mound of earth, which McQueen tried to kick away during the take. Coburn plays down the animosity, but admits there were some ground rules, as far as Brynner was concerned. \"He was the king. Heh-heh-heh... When he would march on to the set, nobody could come within 12 feet of him.\" </p> <p>Coburn got on well with McQueen, though he acknowledges he had a fiercely competitive streak. \"He was a giant egoist,\" says Coburn, who had worked with him on the TV western series Wanted: Dead or Alive and made several other films with him. \"We were shooting Hell is For Heroes and he said 'Why don't they just make a film about one guy - me?' \" </p> <p>Coburn became a major Hollywood leading man in the role of Our Man Flint, which briefly rivalled James Bond in the 60s, and he became the very epitome of cool (Austin Powers watches the sequel, In Like Flint, in his sequel). Vaughn went on to become co-star of TV's The Man from UNCLE, a 60s sensation. And Bronson made the unlikely transition from heavy to superstar-hero thanks to Michael Winner and the Death Wish films. </p> <p>No other western managed to assemble so many actors destined to become stars. \"Well, eh,\" says Coburn, \"what's his name, the guy that nobody can remember, didn't.\" He means stock heavy Brad Dexter. \"He got the part because of Frank Sinatra. He saved Frank Sinatra's life out in Hawaii islands... swimming. A big wave took him out and Brad went out and got him... John Sturges had worked with Frank Sinatra, so Frank asked John to give Brad a part.\" </p> <p>Coburn had reservations about the German actor, Horst Buchholz, as the young Mexican who fancies himself as a gunslinger. \"John was enamoured though... He shot a lot of film of Horst. I thought he missed there, but that was the one place. I think everybody else was cast quite well.\" McQueen's manager, Hilly Elkins, subsequently became Coburn's manager too. \"I met Hilly on The Magnificent Seven, because Steve always had problems. He creates problems, so he had Hilly come down and solve these problems. Of course they were just imaginary, heh-heh. That was one of Steve's great things: he would create a situation and call somebody else in to solve it... something to do with the script probably.\" </p> <p>Coburn and McQueen shared many similar interests and became close friends. \"We would always hang out together, smoke grass, get high and go up the mountains and drive fast cars.\" </p> <p>One of the biggest problems on The Magnificent Seven was the Mexican official who insisted the Mexican peasants' outfits must always be pristine white. \"They didn't want Mexicans to look like they had dirt,\" says Coburn, which explains why they look as if they have just stepped out of a Persil commercial. </p> <p>It was a great script. In the Guardian's Cinefile column, Colin Bateman, author of Divorcing Jack, cited \"We deal in lead\" as his all-time favourite piece of movie dialogue. Mine is Brynner's closing speech: \"The old man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost. We always lose.\" Then Brynner and McQueen ride off into the sunset. And Buchholz, the only other survivor, unfastens his gunbelt and joins the women in the cornfield. Is there a more powerful, scene in cinema? </p> <p>Clint Eastwood gets the credit for pioneering the taciturn western hero, but Coburn has only four words in that unforgettable, four-minute introductory scene in The Magnificent Seven, where he is challenged to a duel, knife against gun, first for sport - \"You lost\", and then for real - \"Call it\". </p> <p>The other guy did all the talking, but the audience is focused on Coburn. Sturges was a former film editor who knew exactly what he wanted and storyboarded every scene. Sturges also directed The Great Escape, which reunited Coburn, McQueen and Bronson, Ice Station Zebra, Gunfight at the OK Corral, Bad Day at Black Rock, and Last Train From Gun Hill, a neglected western masterpiece. </p> <p>And yet, as Coburn puts it, \"you've never heard of a John Sturges film\". But why should Sturges's name remain so obscure when Ford, Leone and Peckinpah are lionised? \"Peckinpah!\" Coburn worked with him on a string of films and was his Pat Garrett opposite Kris Kristofferson's Billy the Kid. \"Difficult is not the word... Sam created a lot of chaos. He liked chaos. He liked to work with it and keep everybody on edge, where John was just the opposite way round - he liked everything under control. \"He didn't impose a directorial style on any picture. He imposed more of an editorial style, which is getting the shot, telling the story clearly. Sam liked ambiguity. He didn't like it on the nose. If it was on the nose, it was wrong. If it was right, it was wrong in his language. He liked to have the audience work.\" </p> <p>And yet The Magnificent Seven was an ambiguous western. Far removed from High Noon, its heroes were not lawmen but professional gunfighters, ready to die, not for the forward march of civilisation, but for adventure, gold and, maybe, some tenuous notion of honour. \"These guys sacrificed themselves to be who they were, because they didn't have anything else to do,\" says Coburn. \"They were the samurai of the day - the era of the gunfighter was over.\" </p> <p>When I grew up no one was looking for adventurers to ride across the Rio Grande any more. But for me, and for many of my generation, it's not over. In our imaginations, we still saddle up with Brynner, McQueen and Coburn.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Mike Leigh, so the legend goes, doesn't suffer fools. Forget about gladly, he just doesn't suffer them. Which is why, with hindsight, it was stupid to ask after his leg when he limped in on a crutch. Maybe he'd have a funny, quotable answer - something about a slapstick on-set mishap, something to break the ice. </p> <p>\"It's not my leg,\" comes the reply. \"It's my hip. I've got chronic arthritis in my hip.\" </p> <p>The pause which follows is brief: a second, maybe two. It seems far longer. </p> <p>Still, despite his reputation for brusqueness and my uncanny way with a faux pas, he chooses not to pass further comment, happily scattering files around his Greek Street office, grabbing a cardboard box to use as an impromptu coffee table. He's already discussing his latest feature, Topsy-Turvy - \"I've always eschewed films about actors, but this time I thought OK, let's just bite the bullet\" - as he balances his crutch against a chair and takes a seat, bright-eyed and apparently unabashed by either physical discomfort or journalistic gracelessness. He looks on good form. </p> <p>It's probably just as well. After all, Topsy-Turvy - ostensibly a portrait of Gilbert and Sullivan struggling through the gestation of The Mikado - isn't short on talking points; not least what this most doggedly egalitarian of directors is doing in bed with the late 19th century kings of light opera. No matter how convincingly he details his long-standing enthusiasm for his subjects, incongruity still hovers over the idea of Leigh, champion of the ordinary ever since 1971's aptly-titled Bleak Moments, mixing it with Three Little Maids. </p> <p>\"Well,\" he explains, \"that in itself is obviously part of the attraction - the naughty attraction - of doing it. It's precisely that particular piece of subversion. And, you know, the whole thing, taking this chocolate box subject matter and treating it perfectly seriously, is full of subversions. So, to tell you the truth, I do think of it as quite a radical film.\" </p> <p>And, when you think of what a Mike Leigh film is supposed to be, all anoraks and awkward silences, he's right. So he must be aware that at least some of his audience - what he calls \"the Naked/Meantime punters\" after the two most emotionally visceral films of his career - will already be recoiling at the mere thought of Jim Broadbent's WS Gilbert waxing his handlebar moustache. \"Of course,\" he admits, \"a core constituency of punters are going to have something to deal with. But the bottom line is, fine, they're going to be able to deal with it. Or they won't. But, actually, if they approach it in the right spirit, they will.\" </p> <p>He shrugs. \"I mean, people always have a bee in their bonnet about something. There was a lot of rubbish talked about misogyny in Naked, and I dare say that put some people off but, you know, I've been around long enough to weather these storms...\" </p> <p>Ah yes, the storms. He'll return to them later. For now, we'll stick with Topsy-Turvy, a film that, despite its rigorous attention to period detail, none the less raises two sly fingers to the dread conventions of costume drama. For a start, there's none of the creepy, thinly-veiled ardour for Victoriana which oozes through the works of, say, Merchant-Ivory. (\"One of the main reasons for doing a period film,\" he confirms, \"was doing one which wasn't like a period film.\") Moreover, in both cast (including such Leigh regulars as Broadbent, Timothy Spall and his former wife Alison Steadman), and gently mordant humour, this is - once you get past the frock coats - still an entirely Mike Leigh movie. </p> <p>\"It is a very idiosyncratic film,\" he says, staring into the middle distance, \"full of me sort of things, jokes and juxtapositions and all of that. And one of the things I tried to do - as I always do - is put in the stuff you normally never see. I mean, I wasn't ever concerned with trying to bring film reality to the world of the opera. The issue was to take an objective look at this industrial process. And, in the context of a period film, I wanted to show what isn't generally shown - someone bellowing down the telephone, someone having their teeth out and so on. Because, ultimately, it's a film about people, and relationships and, you know...\" - Leigh's famously hangdog expression cracks into a smile - \"all the usual things which skulk around in my films. The real things. The moments in between.\" </p> <p>The moments in between; it's as apt a summary of what makes Leigh's films special as you're ever likely to hear. Because for much of his career Leigh told the stories no one else would. His devotion to the minutiae of the seemingly mundane, his grasp of life at the business end of the class divide - these things marked him out. </p> <p>Which made the acclaim that greeted his 1996 opus, Secrets and Lies, all the more gratifying. The only problem was that, to many commentators, the combination of the film's profound warmth and the partial approbation of Hollywood (five Academy nominations, although sadly no gongs) gave Leigh's personal narrative too happy an ending. A lot of them would probably have preferred to see him bow out with his plaudits and his Palme d'Or then and there. Instead he made Career Girls, a slightly mannered comedy concerning two young women reviewing their student days. </p> <p>The critical reaction to Career Girls was tepid, occasionally venomous. Now, with Topsy-Turvy, he must see the danger that when Gilbert reacts in fury to the sniffy notices awarded his and Sullivan's abortive Princess Ida, audiences are simply going to see Mike Leigh up onscreen. \"In all honesty,\" he counters, \"that thought never entered my head until you just said it.\" </p> <p>There's another pregnant pause; eventually his features soften. \"Look, quite rightly you've got a tendency to ask if there's a danger in these things. And the answer, of course, is yes - but there's a danger in every bloody thing. Look at Naked, it's an absolute minefield. I mean, if I get talked about in this gobshite sort of way, that's the way it crumbles. But, yes, if people look back on what I've done in the future, Career Girls runs a serious risk of being squashed.\" He's suddenly animated, endearingly genuine. \"How do you get along with it?\" </p> <p>I tell him I liked it a lot more when I watched it a second time, without the long shadow of its predecessor. \"Right. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing, people tell me they liked it, and it really said something to them, and it was something they really related to. There was just this feeling I was due for a bollocking. It was the same with Naked.\" </p> <p>This is the third time he's mentioned his dense mid-90s sketch of a loveless, broken London which brought equal parts eulogy and vitriol down on its director, the latter inspired - however erroneously - by the film's supposed hostility to women. You wonder if that still rankles. \"Well, when people call me a misogynist,\" he replies, \"I either think they're extremely naive - and therefore not very bright - or I don't trust where they're coming from. To walk away from Naked and only have that to say... I mean, even if one were to take on those kind of criticisms, which I did endlessly at one stage, there's a deliberate spectrum of women dealing with their lives in quite different ways...\" He trails off, exasperated. \"Maybe we should move on.\" </p> <p>So we do. But there's no getting round the fact that Topsy-Turvy finds Leigh in a strange position: on the one hand removing the dents in his reputation left by Career Girls, on the other trying to keep himself interested. He's also got what many people see as an obligation to reflect the spirit of the times (as reflected in the pathological social climbing of his 1977 classic Abigail's Party, or the grim, bloodied defiance of Naked); having trekked back to the 1880s for his latest thematic, has he run out of things to say about the here and now? </p> <p>\"Just for my own sanity,\" he responds, \"it's important not to parody myself. And I'm very aware what I do is fraught with the potential for self-parody. Anyway, the question is, does Topsy-Turvy deliver an unproblematic journey through the jolly old niceties of late Victorian comic opera, or do you get a few smacks in the gob along the way? And I think the answer is clear. I mean, the thing is to make films about ordinary people who are in the end very extraordinary, whereas with this... well, I used to get a huge buzz when the Transport Museum was still in Clapham, because there in Queen Victoria's garage was her personal toilet. And I enjoyed that immensely, standing next to where Queen Victoria used to crap. And that philosophy of looking at apparently remarkable people at their most deeply ordinary has always appealed to me.\" </p> <p>Sure enough, Topsy-Turvy's novelty lies less in its setting than its director's inversion of his trademark MO, taking his glittering subjects and rendering them as bad-tempered, selfish and occasionally inspiring as the rest of us; just as - in reverse - the monstrous Beverly in Abigail's Party or the disastrously inventive chef Aubrey in Life is Sweet crossed the line from mere screen characters to modern British icons.</p> <p>It's part of the process which has seen Leigh become a credible name to drop among the young and gifted (and you can see his influence now in everything from Todd Solondz's dyspeptic Happiness to the small-screen antics of The Royle Family). Yet while everyone craves respect, no one wants to become an institution, gladhanded into history. How does he feel about his status as a walking film school tutorial? </p> <p>\"Nothing bad,\" is his response. \"But on the other hand, it doesn't make me feel in any way disposed to pack up and go home - ie, retire. It's fine, it's good, it's very nice, but it doesn't solve my problems. And my current problem is my next film. I mean, I have worries, not least that I've got to get a new hip, and it's actually terribly important that I get on with things, because if I can't bloody walk then I can't make films. These are the things which preoccupy me - you don't spend your time thinking about legacies. You've got a job to do.\" </p> <p>He gazes out of the third-floor window. \"The only thing I can compare it to is that I sit on the tube every day between Leicester Square and Wood Green, and it remains a surprise if, as sometimes happens, someone comes up and tells me how much they like my films. Because you don't sit there thinking, 'I am Mike Leigh, I am Mike Leigh, look at me, aren't I fantastic, I'm famous and look, I'm sitting here on the tube with you oiks.' You sit there thinking 'Oh, it's getting a bit late, what am I going to do when I get home, shall I go out for a drink, what shall I have for my dinner, shall I have the same as I did last night?'.\" </p> <p>And so life goes on, full as ever with its Mike Leigh moments; the moments in between.</p> <p>\u0095 Topsy-Turvy opens on February 18.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mike Leigh, so the legend goes, doesn't suffer fools. Forget about gladly, he just doesn't suffer them. Which is why, with hindsight, it was stupid to ask after his leg when he limped in on a crutch. Maybe he'd have a funny, quotable answer - something about a slapstick on-set mishap, something to break the ice. \"It's not my leg,\" comes the reply. \"It's my hip. I've got chronic arthritis in my hip.\" The pause which follows is brief: a second, maybe two. It seems far longer. Still, despite his reputation for brusqueness and my uncanny way with a faux pas, he chooses not to pass further comment, happily scattering files around his Greek Street office, grabbing a cardboard box to use as an impromptu coffee table. He's already discussing his latest feature, Topsy-Turvy - \"I've always eschewed films about actors, but this time I thought OK, let's just bite the bullet\" - as he balances his crutch against a chair and takes a seat, bright-eyed and apparently unabashed by either physical discomfort or journalistic gracelessness. He looks on good form. It's probably just as well. After all, Topsy-Turvy - ostensibly a portrait of Gilbert and Sullivan struggling through the gestation of The Mikado - isn't short on talking points; not least what this most doggedly egalitarian of directors is doing in bed with the late 19th century kings of light opera. No matter how convincingly he details his long-standing enthusiasm for his subjects, incongruity still hovers over the idea of Leigh, champion of the ordinary ever since 1971's aptly-titled Bleak Moments, mixing it with Three Little Maids. \"Well,\" he explains, \"that in itself is obviously part of the attraction - the naughty attraction - of doing it. It's precisely that particular piece of subversion. And, you know, the whole thing, taking this chocolate box subject matter and treating it perfectly seriously, is full of subversions. So, to tell you the truth, I do think of it as quite a radical film.\" And, when you think of what a Mike Leigh film is supposed to be, all anoraks and awkward silences, he's right. So he must be aware that at least some of his audience - what he calls \"the Naked/Meantime punters\" after the two most emotionally visceral films of his career - will already be recoiling at the mere thought of Jim Broadbent's WS Gilbert waxing his handlebar moustache. \"Of course,\" he admits, \"a core constituency of punters are going to have something to deal with. But the bottom line is, fine, they're going to be able to deal with it. Or they won't. But, actually, if they approach it in the right spirit, they will.\" He shrugs. \"I mean, people always have a bee in their bonnet about something. There was a lot of rubbish talked about misogyny in Naked, and I dare say that put some people off but, you know, I've been around long enough to weather these storms...\" Ah yes, the storms. He'll return to them later. For now, we'll stick with Topsy-Turvy, a film that, despite its rigorous attention to period detail, none the less raises two sly fingers to the dread conventions of costume drama. For a start, there's none of the creepy, thinly-veiled ardour for Victoriana which oozes through the works of, say, Merchant-Ivory.

      "body": "<p>When the share price of your company triples on its first day of trading it is usually a cause for celebration. But New Capital Invest's Aim debut yesterday was a bit of an embarrassment. </p> <p>The cash shell had spent the past few weeks quietly placing 8m new shares at 25p each with private clients and institutions. Its aim was to secure a low-profile listing from which to acquire a significant stake in a single company working in new media and e-commerce. </p> <p>The management didn't want a JellyWorks or a Knutsford, both of which soared away on hopes of a big bid or investment. But amid the euphoria surrounding dot.coms and retail investors' appetite for small stocks there is no such thing as a quiet arrival. By the close of trading the shares had risen almost fourfold to 92.5p. </p> <p>New Capital's cover was blown as the market focused its attention on two individuals behind the company. The first is its chairman, Nigel Whittaker, a retail guru and one of the original four man management team at Kingfisher and later chairman of B&amp;Q. </p> <p>The second is non-executive director Oded Zucker, vice-president of investments for Prudential-Bache, a Luxembourg fund that handles high net worth clients. He is understood to have extensive contacts in Israel's burgeoning hi-tech industry. </p> <p>Sources suggest New Capital has a tentative list of three or four companies in the region and would like to take a stake of 20%-50% in one of them. The value of the firm could be between \u00a350m and \u00a3300m and the investment would be funded through the issue of new shares to institutions. </p> <p>However, a third individual appears to have gone unnoticed.

      "bodyText": "When the share price of your company triples on its first day of trading it is usually a cause for celebration. But New Capital Invest's Aim debut yesterday was a bit of an embarrassment. The cash shell had spent the past few weeks quietly placing 8m new shares at 25p each with private clients and institutions. Its aim was to secure a low-profile listing from which to acquire a significant stake in a single company working in new media and e-commerce. The management didn't want a JellyWorks or a Knutsford, both of which soared away on hopes of a big bid or investment. But amid the euphoria surrounding dot.coms and retail investors' appetite for small stocks there is no such thing as a quiet arrival. By the close of trading the shares had risen almost fourfold to 92.5p. New Capital's cover was blown as the market focused its attention on two individuals behind the company. The first is its chairman, Nigel Whittaker, a retail guru and one of the original four man management team at Kingfisher and later chairman of B&amp;Q. The second is non-executive director Oded Zucker, vice-president of investments for Prudential-Bache, a Luxembourg fund that handles high net worth clients. He is understood to have extensive contacts in Israel's burgeoning hi-tech industry. Sources suggest New Capital has a tentative list of three or four companies in the region and would like to take a stake of 20%-50% in one of them. The value of the firm could be between \u00a350m and \u00a3300m and the investment would be funded through the issue of new shares to institutions. However, a third individual appears to have gone unnoticed. Command Fund Limited, a Geneva-based, Grand Cayman incorporated company that owns 40% of New Capital, is understood to be the vehicle for Stephen Tucker, a low-profile multi-millionaire. He and associates want to use New Capital to expand a portfolio of new-media investments. This is one to watch.",

      "bodyText": "ICI's arduous three-year restructuring programme has borne fruit for the speciality chemicals group with it almost halving its net debt to \u00a32.3bn and reporting a 17% leap in annual pre-tax profit, before exceptionals and goodwill, to \u00a3376m. The 1999 profit was at the top end of analyst forecasts, prompting immediate earnings upgrades, and saw ICI's share price rise 10% to 539p. Charles Miller Smith, chairman of ICI, predicted more good news in 2000 for the former industrial conglomerate. \"The current positive economic outlook should enable ICI to deliver further sustained profit growth during the coming year,\" he said. ICI's profit and share price performance have suffered through the restructuring with the stock still hovering near 12-month lows. \"The record performance in our core businesses validates our strategic change,\" Mr Miller Smith said. \"Excellent progress was made in reshaping the portfolio and restoring balance sheet strength.\" The former bell-wether of the UK industrial sector slimmed further in 1999 with the sale of four of its operations, the largest of which was a $2.8bn sale of most of its industrial chemicals to US group Huntsman Corporation. Those proceeds helped to reduce debt from \u00a34.2bn to \u00a32.3bn. ICI is expected to begin to look at bolt-on acquisitions in speciality chemicals now its debt has reached a level more acceptable to the market. It's turnover during the year increased 2.6% to \u00a35.6bn, with only some sales affected by millennium bug worries in the last quarter. Trading in core businesses of speciality products and paints jumped 7.8% to \u00a3582m. Industrial chemicals remained loss-making. The group held its final dividend at 32p.",

The global platform would provide a secure niche network for financial groups to undertake mainly e-commerce, equity transactions and other communication services, estimated to be worth \u00a313bn. Reuters said it would own 51% of the joint venture company which is not yet named but will be operating by June and headquartered in New York. The British information group will transfer its Reuters Connect Services Division into the joint venture as well as $130m of its telecommunication network assets and 400 staff, in return for $25m. Equant will contribute 100 staff, $230m in cash and a further $150m of other services and contracted revenue. The announcement yesterday precedes a wider strategy statement that will be made by Reuters next Tuesday on the internet, which may see it floating off some of its divisions such as Instinet, the online broker. David Ure, an executive director of Reuters, said: \"This deal is about putting together elements from two leading organisations to create a great new business - we hope.

Reuters shares soared 80p to \u00a310.46, with some analysts stating that the joint venture could add 127p to the British group's share price. Patrick Wellington, analyst at Schroders, said the $400m in estimated sales of the joint venture company, could give it a market capitalisation of $6bn when compared with peers such as Energis and Colt. \"Reuters are now beginning to leverage their assets and to work their share price,\" Mr Wellington said. He has a target price on the stock of \u00a313. Reuters said the joint venture company would also work closely with its 63%-owned Tibco Software to enable the delivery of its applications over the network. Neither company would comment on cost savings created from the joint venture or the new company's growth prospects. However, it was speculated that the new company would have growth targets of up to 30% annually. Equant also warned yesterday that its 1999 operating profit would be lower than expected.",

But if the markets take the view that the bank does care more about the exchange rate than just its impact on inflation then the way is open for the forex market speculators to try to test its resolve. In the long run, however, a growing perception that the ECB does care about the euro might be no bad thing. The bank cannot be indifferent to the exchange rate, not only for domestic economic reasons but also because it needs to respect the sensibilities of the euro zone's trading partners. But it might be better still if the bank were to acknowledge such concerns openly.",

      "byline": "Paul Murphy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sun editor David Yelland might like to see Piers Morgan, his rival round at the Mirror, locked up. If nothing else, it would be good for circulation and it would be rude not to kick a rival while he's down. </p> <p>The pressure on Mr Morgan to explain why exactly he invested \u00a320,000 in a company run by his friend Sir Alan Sugar just before his newspaper tipped the shares and sent the price up 100% - more or less doubling the Mirror editor's money - is growing rather than fading. But Mr Yelland might as well stop dreaming of that front page picture with the banner header - Guilty! It is just not going to happen. </p> <p>Mr Morgan, it should quickly be pointed out, is protesting his innocence in the strongest possible terms. Lots of people had tipped Sir Alan's Viglen Technology. It was widely known that it was bolstering its internet business and, in any case, Mr Morgan didn't see the piece of journalistic puffery on his paper's City Slickers page until after he had bought the shares. It just made him smile. </p> <p>If he had, there might be a case to answer under part five of the criminal justice act, 1993 - a breach of which carries a recommended sentence of up to seven years and/or an unlimited fine. </p> <p>Yet it is almost nine years since anyone went behind bars for their stock market dealings. The last soul to go down was one Ivan Goodman, a company director trading in a little known company called Unigroup. He got 18 months, nine suspended. </p> <p>There is no guessing how many times the crime of insider dealing has been committed since then. Every single business day in the City of London share prices rise or fall in advance of official news announcements which prove to be \"price sensitive\". </p> <p> Insiders, whether they be company executives, corporate financiers, stockbrokers, publicans or even journalists, are dealing on the stock market in the knowledge that a piece of news is about to emerge which will affect the relevant share price. So when the law says this is a criminal act, why is no one brought to book these days? </p> <p>The answer is sad and simple. The authorities have discovered, to their deep embarrassment, that the legislation doesn't work. On too many occasions, while armed with what on paper looks like a water-tight case, the defendant has slipped off the hook - more often than not because the judge has thrown the case out, declaring that the Crown has failed to argue its case. </p> <p>The problem for the department of trade and the financial services authority, which together police the City, is that as things currently stand insider dealing is nothing short of a criminal act. Prosecutors have to convince a jury of the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. And in the complex world of the stock market, where pieces of hard information, rumours and downright lies are pinging around at lightning speed, doubts are easily raised. </p> <p>So the authorities have given up trying to bring anyone to book and they are instead sitting and waiting for parliament to pass the financial services bill - now at the second reading stage. </p> <p>The new legislation aims to clean up the situation by introducing a new offence on top of the insider dealing provisions called \"market abuse\". This will be a piece of civil legislation, allowing the City's watchdog, the FSA, to go for a \"balance of probabilities\" judgment against suspected insiders. These new powers of legislation are loosely based on the American model, where irregularities in the financial markets are pursued with real passion. </p> <p>But the financial services bill is having a rocky ride through the Commons, with questions raised over whether the legislation breaches the European convention on human rights. Already badly delayed, even a smooth ride from here will not see an entry in the statute book until late spring at the earliest. And none of the regulators charged with implementing the new powers expects to be able to wield them until this time next year. </p> <p>In the meantime, the punishments on offer to the financial police amount to little more than causing public embarrassment. </p> <p>Each year, the surveillance department at the London Stock Exchange undertakes about 300 individual investigations, with probes triggered automatically by abnormal share price movements.

      "bodyText": "Sun editor David Yelland might like to see Piers Morgan, his rival round at the Mirror, locked up. If nothing else, it would be good for circulation and it would be rude not to kick a rival while he's down. The pressure on Mr Morgan to explain why exactly he invested \u00a320,000 in a company run by his friend Sir Alan Sugar just before his newspaper tipped the shares and sent the price up 100% - more or less doubling the Mirror editor's money - is growing rather than fading. But Mr Yelland might as well stop dreaming of that front page picture with the banner header - Guilty! It is just not going to happen. Mr Morgan, it should quickly be pointed out, is protesting his innocence in the strongest possible terms. Lots of people had tipped Sir Alan's Viglen Technology. It was widely known that it was bolstering its internet business and, in any case, Mr Morgan didn't see the piece of journalistic puffery on his paper's City Slickers page until after he had bought the shares. It just made him smile. If he had, there might be a case to answer under part five of the criminal justice act, 1993 - a breach of which carries a recommended sentence of up to seven years and/or an unlimited fine. Yet it is almost nine years since anyone went behind bars for their stock market dealings. The last soul to go down was one Ivan Goodman, a company director trading in a little known company called Unigroup. He got 18 months, nine suspended. There is no guessing how many times the crime of insider dealing has been committed since then. Every single business day in the City of London share prices rise or fall in advance of official news announcements which prove to be \"price sensitive\". Insiders, whether they be company executives, corporate financiers, stockbrokers, publicans or even journalists, are dealing on the stock market in the knowledge that a piece of news is about to emerge which will affect the relevant share price. So when the law says this is a criminal act, why is no one brought to book these days? The answer is sad and simple. The authorities have discovered, to their deep embarrassment, that the legislation doesn't work. On too many occasions, while armed with what on paper looks like a water-tight case, the defendant has slipped off the hook - more often than not because the judge has thrown the case out, declaring that the Crown has failed to argue its case. The problem for the department of trade and the financial services authority, which together police the City, is that as things currently stand insider dealing is nothing short of a criminal act. Prosecutors have to convince a jury of the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. And in the complex world of the stock market, where pieces of hard information, rumours and downright lies are pinging around at lightning speed, doubts are easily raised. So the authorities have given up trying to bring anyone to book and they are instead sitting and waiting for parliament to pass the financial services bill - now at the second reading stage. The new legislation aims to clean up the situation by introducing a new offence on top of the insider dealing provisions called \"market abuse\". This will be a piece of civil legislation, allowing the City's watchdog, the FSA, to go for a \"balance of probabilities\" judgment against suspected insiders. These new powers of legislation are loosely based on the American model, where irregularities in the financial markets are pursued with real passion. But the financial services bill is having a rocky ride through the Commons, with questions raised over whether the legislation breaches the European convention on human rights. Already badly delayed, even a smooth ride from here will not see an entry in the statute book until late spring at the earliest. And none of the regulators charged with implementing the new powers expects to be able to wield them until this time next year. In the meantime, the punishments on offer to the financial police amount to little more than causing public embarrassment. Each year, the surveillance department at the London Stock Exchange undertakes about 300 individual investigations, with probes triggered automatically by abnormal share price movements. If real evidence of abuse of information is found, the case is passed to the DTI, which then has the option of appointing inspectors to carry out their own investigation. About 30 cases reach the DTI each year - and Stock Exchange sources say that each and every one of these looks like a blatant breach of the law. The DTI appoints inspectors in just a small handful of cases. These are never publicised and the resultant report never reaches the public eye. And then? Well, nothing happens at all. The DTI, the Stock Exchange and the FSA just have to hope that the fear of being dragged in front of one of their inspectors, and watching the fact leak out among City colleagues, is enough to shame alleged insiders. They simply hope they are providing some sort of deterrent. Piers Morgan, on current evidence, does not need to feel shame. As for the real insiders, they have a window of opportunity that is still a year wide.",

The British company's victory paves the way for an explosive growth in new-generation mobile phones. The deal, masterminded by Chris Gent, Vodafone's flamboyant chief executive - who ruffled German feathers by launching the country's biggest hostile bid and earned the disparaging sobriquet of Mr Cricket - opens the way to a wave of foreign takeovers of German companies. The former Young Conservative chairman and friend of John Major is now set to dominate the market not only in the US and UK but in Germany, Italy, and Spain. It will also be a big player in France. The deal, giving Vodafone 50.5% and Mannesmann 49.5% of the combined group, will see the demerger and probabable flotation of Orange, Britain's third-largest mobile phone company -bought by Mannesmann last October for \u00a320bn and now worth at least \u00a324bn. Consumers can expect a quantum leap in mobile phone capability, as Vodafone and Mannesmann have both entered agreements with internet service providers and software specialists that could swiftly transform everyday life. The deal brings closer the day when individuals will be able to download video clips, music and other web-based products and services on new-style mobile phones. It will also hasten the time when consumers will be able to use mobile and fixed-line screens to obtain combined monthly statements for telephone and bank accounts, and possibly other services such as domestic fuels and water. Vodafone, which took over the US group Airtouch for $60bn a year ago, is already poised to launch the first stage of a global internet service in July.

BoS believes there will be a \"cascade effect\" to prevent a split vote.</p>",

As the top management of all three banks continued their charm offensive of leading institutional investors, one of the City's top banking analysts, Michael Lever at HSBC, added to the confusion by backing the continuing independence of NatWest. While shareholders have until Valentine's day to decide whether to back either of the Scottish banks' bids or go with NatWest's new management team, they are expected to start reaching their decisions as soon as today. Any confirmation about the views of NatWest's biggest shareholders - such as Prudential, Mercury Asset Management, Schroders and Phillips &amp; Drew - is considered to be crucial in determing the fate of NatWest. None of them has yet stated publicly its opinion - although the City was yesterday mulling the implications of apparent sales of BoS shares by Mercury. Amid conflicting recommendations from the few analysts able to make their views public, shareholders remained concerned that the decision was far from clear-cut and the vote would end up being split, which might allow NatWest to escape both bidders. \"We don't have to decide just yet but [it seems] that the vote will be split,\" a senior fund manager said. \"There are signs that some of the institutions are trying to take leadership so that [a split] doesn't happen, but it is a struggle to get that going,\" he said. \"Yet I still don't detect a huge appetite for NatWest remaining independent.\" A theory began to emerge that big shareholders in NatWest who also hold shares in its two Scottish assailants might end up backing the Royal Bank's bid by default. A number of senior fund managers indicated that, while they might have a positive view of Bank of Scotland, they were starting to lean towards Royal Bank's bid. \"There's a view that you don't spoil a decent bank,\" one banker said. Analysts said it remained difficult to extrapolate any outcome from the four-month tussle, looking at movement in all three banks' shares. NatWest's shares gained 50p to \u00a311.84 - still below the offers by both Scottish banks - while BoS gained 24p to \u00a36.09p and Royal Bank rose 27p to \u00a310.06. Michael Lever, the higly regarded banking analyst who yesterday backed NatWest, said he was surprised the Scottish banks' shareholders were supportive of their bids. He admitted that it had not been an easy decision to back NatWest but he had concluded that the both bids involved \"unacceptable risks\". His views echoed those of Sir David Rowland, the chairman and chief executive of NatWest, who said yesterday: \"At NatWest we are in no doubt that the risk for our shareholders outweigh the claimed rewards\". Both Scottish banks are anxious to build up support behind their bids so shareholders can exert enough pressure on Sir David to recommend one of the bids. BoS believes there will be a \"cascade effect\" to prevent a split vote.",
