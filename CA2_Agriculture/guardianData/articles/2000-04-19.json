However, the bulk of the committee - including the governor, Eddie George - preferred to adopt a wait-and-see stance, warning that higher interest rates could exacerbate the imbalance in the economy between the strong service sector and the weakness in manufacturing. Minutes of the MPC meeting held on April 5-6 showed that the committee took a relaxed view of Gordon Brown's boost to public spending in the March budget, saying \"the impact on future activity and inflation from the budget seemed unlikely to be large over the next two years.\" The more hawkish group on the MPC said that domestic demand was growing rapidly and that although this was being offset in the short run by the burgeoning trade gap, the position was not sustainable over the medium term.

      "body": "<p>SmithKline Beecham has offered to dispose of drugs production for herpes and nausea in an attempt to satisfy competitive concerns over its merger with Glaxo Wellcome. </p> <p>The products, Kytril and Famvir, are in areas where both groups have leading treatments; the suggestion is understood to have been made this week in a submission to the European commission. </p> <p>The pharmaceuticals companies are optimistic that the proposal will avert the need for a lengthy regulatory investigation. The sale could net up to \u00a3600m. </p> <p>On Tuesday the EC extended the deadline for its \"phase one\" ruling on the merger by two weeks until May 8. It is thought unlikely to launch a detailed \"phase two\" inquiry, which could take months longer. </p> <p>Glaxo Wellcome owns the world's leading treatment for herpes, Zovirax, which had sales of \u00a3412m last year. Zovirax has recently gone off-patent but the company is eager to hang on to its successor product, Valtrax. This competes directly with SmithKline's Famvir, which generated revenue of \u00a3130m. </p> <p>Paul Diggle, an analyst at SG Securities, said SmithKline should be able to sell Famvir for a sum equivalent to about two years of sales - although he added: \"Obviously, other companies out there will know they're under a bit of pressure to sell.\" </p> <p>SmithKline's Kytril - used to prevent vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy - had sales of \u00a3416m last year. It is a rival to Glaxo's Zofran. </p> <p>In addition to negotiations with the EC, the two companies are discussing the deal with the United States federal trade commission. </p> <p>If regulators give the green light the companies will send out full offer documents; extraordinary general meetings to vote on the tie-up are likely to be in June. </p> <p>There were initially suggestions that the groups might overlap on smoking cessation products. But regulators are believed to be taking the view that Glaxo's prescription pill, Zyban, is in a different market from SmithKline's smokers' chewing gum, Nicorette, and skin patch Nicoderm. </p> <p>Analysts believe there is still an outside chance that competition authorities could raise concern over aspects of the groups' research pipeline. </p> <p>Both are preparing an assault on the virtually untapped market for irritable bowel syndrome - a condition which is estimated to affect a fifth of the world's adult population. </p> <p>However, this is not thought to have caused a problem in negotiations so far, because the chances of both reaching the market are relatively low. </p> <p>SmithKline and Glaxo are due to announce quarterly results today. </p> <p>At its annual meeting, scheduled for next week, SmithKline will take a step closer to the deal when chief executive Jan Leschly stands down to make way for Jean-Pierre Garnier, who has been designated chief executive of the combined group.</p>",

      "bodyText": "SmithKline Beecham has offered to dispose of drugs production for herpes and nausea in an attempt to satisfy competitive concerns over its merger with Glaxo Wellcome. The products, Kytril and Famvir, are in areas where both groups have leading treatments; the suggestion is understood to have been made this week in a submission to the European commission. The pharmaceuticals companies are optimistic that the proposal will avert the need for a lengthy regulatory investigation. The sale could net up to \u00a3600m. On Tuesday the EC extended the deadline for its \"phase one\" ruling on the merger by two weeks until May 8. It is thought unlikely to launch a detailed \"phase two\" inquiry, which could take months longer. Glaxo Wellcome owns the world's leading treatment for herpes, Zovirax, which had sales of \u00a3412m last year. Zovirax has recently gone off-patent but the company is eager to hang on to its successor product, Valtrax. This competes directly with SmithKline's Famvir, which generated revenue of \u00a3130m. Paul Diggle, an analyst at SG Securities, said SmithKline should be able to sell Famvir for a sum equivalent to about two years of sales - although he added: \"Obviously, other companies out there will know they're under a bit of pressure to sell.\" SmithKline's Kytril - used to prevent vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy - had sales of \u00a3416m last year. It is a rival to Glaxo's Zofran. In addition to negotiations with the EC, the two companies are discussing the deal with the United States federal trade commission. If regulators give the green light the companies will send out full offer documents; extraordinary general meetings to vote on the tie-up are likely to be in June. There were initially suggestions that the groups might overlap on smoking cessation products. But regulators are believed to be taking the view that Glaxo's prescription pill, Zyban, is in a different market from SmithKline's smokers' chewing gum, Nicorette, and skin patch Nicoderm. Analysts believe there is still an outside chance that competition authorities could raise concern over aspects of the groups' research pipeline. Both are preparing an assault on the virtually untapped market for irritable bowel syndrome - a condition which is estimated to affect a fifth of the world's adult population. However, this is not thought to have caused a problem in negotiations so far, because the chances of both reaching the market are relatively low. SmithKline and Glaxo are due to announce quarterly results today. At its annual meeting, scheduled for next week, SmithKline will take a step closer to the deal when chief executive Jan Leschly stands down to make way for Jean-Pierre Garnier, who has been designated chief executive of the combined group.",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge yesterday lifted the veil of government secrecy from 100,000 unfair dismissal, sex and race discrimination and other tribunal claims brought by employees each year. Mr Justice Jackson ruled that full details of claims filed at employment tribunals should be open to inspection. \"As a matter of public policy, litigation should be conducted under public gaze and scrutiny,\" he said. The judge held that the central office of the employment tribunals acted unlawfully in allowing access only to the names of the parties and a bare description of claims. He said parliament had laid down in the Employment Tribunals Act that the public had the right to inspect particulars of cases. The ruling, on the day before the government's much-criticised freedom of information bill has its second reading in the House of Lords, is a victory for the whistleblowers' charity Public Concern at Work. The charity wanted details of claims brought by whistleblowers alleging victimisation, so it could monitor how the Public Interest Disclosure Act was working. The act, which came into force last summer, protects whistleblowers against sacking and allows them to bring victimisation claims. Public Concern at Work challenged the employment tribunal service's refusal to give it the information. In the high court the tribunal service, represented by government lawyers, argued that publicity would hinder Acas, the advisory, conciliation and arbitration service, in trying to settle cases before they reached the tribunal. The service also claimed it would be administratively difficult to provide the details. Guy Dehn, director of Public Concern at Work, said: \"This case shows how easy it is for public officials to think that administrative convenience trumps other public interests. \"The fact that this can happen even when parliament has provided otherwise demonstrates why it is so important that the freedom of information bill is strengthened by the House of Lords.\" A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said the judge had granted permission to appeal and the tribunal service was considering appealing. \"While the government supports freedom of information, there is a balance to be drawn between the competing interests of privacy and public access to what may be personal information.\"",

      "body": "<p>As a musical movement, Scottish jazz has been building since the preternaturally gifted 16-year-old saxophonist Tommy Smith strolled out of Edinburgh's housing schemes onto the world stage in the 80s. Thankfully, the snapshot offered at Jazz Now! was far removed from the creaky official Edinburgh Jazz Festival, embracing everything from the celtic bodhran to drum'n'bass. </p> <p>At the end of last year, a band called AAB won the Radio 3 jazz album of 1999 with Cold Fusion. This was a bit of a shock, as they had never played London. While no one was looking, a groundswell of young Scots had become a serious enclave that now had its own Edinburgh-based label Caber Records, whose latest release, launched during Jazz Now!, is Nemesis from the Paul Harrison Trio. Pianist Harrison's urgent compositions jilted an unsuspecting Traverse audience and introduced an explosive new talent in drummer Paddy Flaherty, whose breakneck rhythmic invention drove the band to exultant heights. </p> <p>AAB were a startling pointer to a new club-friendly jazz sound.

      "bodyText": "As a musical movement, Scottish jazz has been building since the preternaturally gifted 16-year-old saxophonist Tommy Smith strolled out of Edinburgh's housing schemes onto the world stage in the 80s. Thankfully, the snapshot offered at Jazz Now! was far removed from the creaky official Edinburgh Jazz Festival, embracing everything from the celtic bodhran to drum'n'bass. At the end of last year, a band called AAB won the Radio 3 jazz album of 1999 with Cold Fusion. This was a bit of a shock, as they had never played London. While no one was looking, a groundswell of young Scots had become a serious enclave that now had its own Edinburgh-based label Caber Records, whose latest release, launched during Jazz Now!, is Nemesis from the Paul Harrison Trio. Pianist Harrison's urgent compositions jilted an unsuspecting Traverse audience and introduced an explosive new talent in drummer Paddy Flaherty, whose breakneck rhythmic invention drove the band to exultant heights. AAB were a startling pointer to a new club-friendly jazz sound. The trio moved from the jumping staccato Repetitious Song to a Zeppelinesque trip-hammer epic, Kashmir, deconstructed into white noise and jagged saxophone permutations. In contrast, a new acoustic duo, guitarist Don Patterson and pianist Dave Milligan, wound hypnotic improvisational exchanges around stripped-down folk reels and cool laments.

United quickly win possession and look to set to attack from the off.<br> <strong>2</strong> Whatever United's intentions, the first chance of the match falls to Real. A quick break finds Roberto Carlos, who started the game in midfield, in space on the left wing. His low cross is hit early, curls beyond the entire United defence, but misses the Madrid forwards too.<br> <strong>3</strong> A direct run from Ryan Giggs is brought to an end by Ivan Helguera at the expense of a corner. The resulting kick from David Beckham comes to nothing.<br> <strong>5</strong> Again United break down the left, the ball moving from Andy Cole to Ryan Giggs whose cross is cleared unconditionally by Aitor Karanka.<br> <strong>6</strong> Swift interplay between Raul and Fernando Morientes forces Gary Neville into a sliding tackle in the box. Fortunately for the United man, it is a clean one.<br> <strong>9</strong> The ball is stuck in the midfield third and shows no sign on leaving. Both sides seem unable to unpick the opposing defence just yet.<br> <strong>12</strong> Gary Neville misses a header from an Ivan Campo long ball. The ball falls to Roberto Carlos who rockets off toward the United area. His pass finds Morientes, but the striker get the ball caught under his feet and his tame shot falls straight into Raimond van der Gouw's arms.<br> <strong>15</strong> Another run from Ryan Giggs, this time with a cross attached. He cuts the ball back from just in front of the touchline, but Dwight Yorke gets his angles wrong and his header flashes wide.<br> <strong>16</strong> Roberto Carlos pops up in the United area seizing on a loose ball from Neville. Carlos almost nutmegs van der Gouw, but the veteran Dutchman manages to dive over the ball before the Brazilian has a chance to strike.<br> <strong>19</strong> Another cross from the United left, this time from Denis Irwin, almost finds Paul Scholes in the box.<br> <strong>20 GOAL! Man Utd 0 - 1 Real Madrid</strong> Referee Collina plays an advantage and allows McManaman to slip the ball to Helguera. The full back plays a quick cross from the right which looks dangerous. Roy Keane goes to intercept the ball before the near post but only succeeds in putting the ball through his own net. An unfortunate way to concede an away goal.<br> <strong>23</strong> Another Giggs cross comes in, but Dwight Yorke fails to make anything out of it.<br> <strong>25</strong> Giggs finds Scholes whose sly pass picks out David Beckham on the left-hand side of the box. Beckham advances on Iker Casillas who palms away his left-foot shot.<br> <strong>26</strong> Another cross from Giggs creates a chance that is spurned by Yorke, whose knockdown this time misses Andy Cole by some 10 yards.<br> <strong>29</strong> A flick from Cole on the edge of the box finds a typically marauding Keane. He controls the ball well and shoots, but Casillas stands up well. United may be down, but at least they are finding some penetration at last.<br> <strong>32</strong> A lunging tackle from Keane on Savio gives away a free kick on the edge of the box. A certain thick-legged Brazilian takes it, but his characteristically rocket-powered shot scuds wide.<br> <strong>33</strong> A chain of one-touch passing brings United to the edge of the Real area. Irwin gives the ball to Yorke and continues into the box. Yorke looks to play the one-two but his touch lets him down once more and the pass runs straight to Casillas.<br> <strong>36</strong> Ryan Giggs is on fire. For about the fourth time in this first half he gives the run around to more than one Real defender. On this occasion he wins a corner, but the Welshman looks United's best bet of creating a real opening.<br> <strong>37</strong> United win another corner, delivered by Beckham. Yorke meets it at the far post and his looping header eludes Casillas. The ball comes to Cole but he can only head over the bar.<br> <strong>42</strong> United almost hand Real another goal. A cross from Michel Salgado whips across the box and Jaap Stam fails to clear. His toepoke ends up at the feet of Morinetes but he blazes over. <br><strong>46</strong> A minute into stoppage time and Real break. Raul tears at the heart of the United defence before playing in McManaman. His cross deflects off Stam and misses the bar by inches.<br> <strong>47</strong> Half time.</p> <p><strong>Second half</strong><br> <strong>45</strong> United substitution: Silvestre for Irwin. United kick off. <strong>46</strong> Two successive United crosses force first a saving header from Roberto Carlos and then a desperate punch from Casillas. Both Yorke and Cole are yet to get a strike on goal.<br> <strong>47 GOAL! Man Utd 0 - 2 Real Madrid</strong> United are punished on the break barely three minutes into the second half. United are busy banging the ball into the Real box when McManaman intercepts. He races off into the United half leaving half the home team stranded. The former Liverpool man's left-foot pass finds Raul advancing on the right. He drags Silvestre to the edge of the box, cuts inside him and fires an unstoppable shot inside the post for his eigth Champions League goal of the season.<br> <strong>50</strong> Now in a potentially desperate position, United must score. Giggs duly tears forward and finds Cole in the box. His deft touch sets up Keane for United's clearest chance of the game. Keane leans back and fires over. It is not his day.<br> <strong>52 GOAL! Man Utd 0 - 3 Real Madrid</strong> Another goal on the break but this time United cannot really blame themselves. A phenomenal piece of skill from Fernando Redondo makes the whole thing possible, playing the ball around Henning Berg with a back heel and then advancing past the flummoxed Norwegian. It is then a simple case of slotting the ball across the box and finding the waiting Raul for the finish. The Argentinian duly does so, to the exhiliration of his teammates. United are in real trouble now.<br> <strong>60</strong> Paul Scholes is booked for a foul. He will miss United's next European match.<br> <strong>62</strong> Man Utd substitution: Sheringham and Solskjaer for Berg and Cole. Real Madrid substitution: Geremi for Savio. United's saviours last summer take their place on the field. The United crowd is not too impressed, booing the withdrawal of Andy Cole.<br> <strong>65 GOAL!

Unfortunately for the Norwegian he tumbles over the ball seconds after controlling it immaculately.<br> <strong>71</strong> Real Madrid substitution: Anelka for Morientes. Good evening M Anelka.<br> <strong>76</strong> The clock continues to count down and United continue to throw everything at Real without much return. The closest United have come to adding to their score is a long-range drive from Paul Scholes which bobbles wide of Casillas' post. <br> <strong>80</strong> A great save from Casillas denies Solskjaer from close range. The 18-year-old keeper has played beyond his years.<br> <strong>83</strong> Solskjaer strikes again. A through ball from Keane give the Norwegian time to turn on the edge of the box, but his shot curls past the post.<br> <strong>85</strong> United remain camped around the Real area. But the Spanish defence refuses to budge, mopping up Beckham crosses as if they faced them every week.<br> <strong>87 GOAL! Man Utd 2 - 3 Real Madrid</strong> With only three minutes remaining, McManaman bundles over Keane in the box. Penalty. Paul Scholes steps up and slams it home.<br> <strong>93</strong> Full time.

      "body": "<p>Chelsea heroically lost the numbers game last night as the real Barcelona finally stood up to be counted. Gianluca Vialli's side, outclassed and largely outfought, could only watch helplessly as their 3-1 lead from the first leg disappeared before their eyes and those of the 98,000 crowd packed into a cacophonous Nou Camp. </p> <p>The pride of Catalonia came into this game on the back of a dismal run of results but their pedigree remained unquestioned. Unfortunately for Chelsea its full force was unleashed just when it mattered, to steer a stylish path into an all Spanish semi-final against Valencia. </p> <p>For Vialli's team to reach this far in Europe's premier club tournament is quite an achievement and something on which the Italian can build. But he knows that in the end Chelsea lack the class to succeed at this level and serious thought will be required in the summer transfer market. </p> <p>\"We didn't impose ourselves in the first half,\" he said. \"We did what we didn't want to do: defend negatively. But we are proud of what we achieved in getting this far.\" </p> <p>Barcelona's dominance of a game packed with drama contrasted starkly with their off night at Stamford Bridge a fortnight ago. Had not Rivaldo missed a penalty and Ed de Goey once again conjured up a series of defiant saves, the Spanish side's margin of victory would have been embarrassing and there would have been no extra-time. </p> <p>Hard as they worked, Chelsea struggled throughout to contain Barcelona's verve and early in extra-time Celestine Babayaro was sent off for ending Luis Figo's weaving run on goal with a desperate tackle from behind, conceding a penalty which Rivaldo did convert. </p> <p>Although the 10 men fought gamely to the finish, this was destined not to be another night of Premiership triumph in the cauldron where Manchester United lifted the European Cup last season. </p> <p>Chelsea's two-goal cushion from the first leg had disappeared by half-time and, though they regained the aggregate lead after a mistake by the Barcelona keeper Ruud Hesp, the home side's quality told in the end. </p> <p>Barcelona's 3-4-3 formation emphasised their need to attack and find the early goal to settle their nerves and tighten Chelsea's. Almost on cue they forced the breakthrough on 24 minutes having dominated the game until then. Even so the goal contained a touch of good fortune as Rivaldo's 25-yard free-kick deflected off Babayaro in the Chelsea wall and left De Goey stranded. </p> <p>Chelsea blunted the immediate threat of a buoyed Barcelona, then almost scored themselves four minutes before half-time when Tore Andre Flo headed just wide. </p> <p>But seconds before half-time calamity struck as Patrick Kluivert, restored to the side after falling out with Louis van Gaal, hit a 20-yard shot against the post. It rebounded to Figo, who cut inside and fired the ball past De Goey's clutching left hand. </p> <p>Chelsea trudged into the dressing room suddenly behind on aggregate, unable to find an antidote to Barcelona's forward surge and a long way from looking like scoring themselves. </p> <p>After the interval Barcelona picked up where they left off and De Goey did well to block a shot from Philip Cocu. But, just as the home side had profited from a touch of luck to take the lead, so Chelsea benefited now. </p> <p>On the hour Hesp collected an innocuous back-pass and, under pressure from Gianfranco Zola, miskicked his clearance straight to Flo out wide. The Norwegian, spotting the keeper off his line, took careful aim and steered a brilliant bending shot into the bottom left corner. </p> <p>Chelsea were back in the lead on aggregate but the Catalan threat lived on. De Goey tipped Michael Reiziger's dipping cross over and from Josep Guardiola's corner Kluivert headed the ball against the join of post and bar. The substitute Dani, unmarked, then hit the side- netting and forced another fine save from De Goey. </p> <p>Chelsea were a tantalising seven minutes from victory when Barcelona found their aggregate equaliser. This time Dani rose high to head Figo's cross past De Goey.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea heroically lost the numbers game last night as the real Barcelona finally stood up to be counted. Gianluca Vialli's side, outclassed and largely outfought, could only watch helplessly as their 3-1 lead from the first leg disappeared before their eyes and those of the 98,000 crowd packed into a cacophonous Nou Camp. The pride of Catalonia came into this game on the back of a dismal run of results but their pedigree remained unquestioned. Unfortunately for Chelsea its full force was unleashed just when it mattered, to steer a stylish path into an all Spanish semi-final against Valencia. For Vialli's team to reach this far in Europe's premier club tournament is quite an achievement and something on which the Italian can build. But he knows that in the end Chelsea lack the class to succeed at this level and serious thought will be required in the summer transfer market. \"We didn't impose ourselves in the first half,\" he said. \"We did what we didn't want to do: defend negatively. But we are proud of what we achieved in getting this far.\" Barcelona's dominance of a game packed with drama contrasted starkly with their off night at Stamford Bridge a fortnight ago. Had not Rivaldo missed a penalty and Ed de Goey once again conjured up a series of defiant saves, the Spanish side's margin of victory would have been embarrassing and there would have been no extra-time. Hard as they worked, Chelsea struggled throughout to contain Barcelona's verve and early in extra-time Celestine Babayaro was sent off for ending Luis Figo's weaving run on goal with a desperate tackle from behind, conceding a penalty which Rivaldo did convert. Although the 10 men fought gamely to the finish, this was destined not to be another night of Premiership triumph in the cauldron where Manchester United lifted the European Cup last season. Chelsea's two-goal cushion from the first leg had disappeared by half-time and, though they regained the aggregate lead after a mistake by the Barcelona keeper Ruud Hesp, the home side's quality told in the end. Barcelona's 3-4-3 formation emphasised their need to attack and find the early goal to settle their nerves and tighten Chelsea's. Almost on cue they forced the breakthrough on 24 minutes having dominated the game until then. Even so the goal contained a touch of good fortune as Rivaldo's 25-yard free-kick deflected off Babayaro in the Chelsea wall and left De Goey stranded. Chelsea blunted the immediate threat of a buoyed Barcelona, then almost scored themselves four minutes before half-time when Tore Andre Flo headed just wide. But seconds before half-time calamity struck as Patrick Kluivert, restored to the side after falling out with Louis van Gaal, hit a 20-yard shot against the post. It rebounded to Figo, who cut inside and fired the ball past De Goey's clutching left hand. Chelsea trudged into the dressing room suddenly behind on aggregate, unable to find an antidote to Barcelona's forward surge and a long way from looking like scoring themselves. After the interval Barcelona picked up where they left off and De Goey did well to block a shot from Philip Cocu. But, just as the home side had profited from a touch of luck to take the lead, so Chelsea benefited now. On the hour Hesp collected an innocuous back-pass and, under pressure from Gianfranco Zola, miskicked his clearance straight to Flo out wide. The Norwegian, spotting the keeper off his line, took careful aim and steered a brilliant bending shot into the bottom left corner. Chelsea were back in the lead on aggregate but the Catalan threat lived on. De Goey tipped Michael Reiziger's dipping cross over and from Josep Guardiola's corner Kluivert headed the ball against the join of post and bar. The substitute Dani, unmarked, then hit the side- netting and forced another fine save from De Goey. Chelsea were a tantalising seven minutes from victory when Barcelona found their aggregate equaliser. This time Dani rose high to head Figo's cross past De Goey. Two minutes later Frank Leboeuf was forced to bring down Kluivert from behind only for Rivaldo to miss the penalty. In extra-time the world player of the year made amends from the spot to give his team the lead and six minutes later Barcelona sealed victory when Kluivert outjumped Bernard Lambourde to head home Guardiola's free-kick despite the brave De Goey getting a hand to the ball. Chelsea battled on. Dennis Wise and Leboeuf went close but at the other end Gabri should have scored and De Goey again denied Dani. After such a run in the Champions League it seems cruel that Chelsea are unlikely to play in it next season as they struggle to claim a qualifying place in the Premiership. There is, of course, the FA Cup final to come. But one sus pects winning that would be scant consolation for last night's defeat and the deficiencies it exposed in Vialli's grand plan. \u0095 Valencia set up an all-Spanish Champions League semi-final against Barcelona next month when they beat Lazio 5-3 on aggregate despite losing 1-0 in Rome last night to a goal by Juan Veron. Barcelona (3-4-3): Hesp; Puyol (Abelardo, 86min), F de Boer, Reiziger (Sergi, 105); Gabri, Guardiola, Cocu, Zenden (Dani, 72); Figo, Kluivert, Rivaldo. Chelsea (4-4-2): De Goey; Ferrer (Lambourde, h-t), Desailly, Leboeuf, Babayaro; Di Matteo, Deschamps (Petrescu, 102), Wise, Morris; Zola (Poyet, 105), Flo. Referee: A Frisk (Sweden).",

      "trailText": "<p>John Lanchester on Ian Rankin's curmudgeonly detective John Rebus</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Set in Darkness by Ian Rankin.</strong><br> Orion, 415 pp., \u00a316.99, 17 February, 0 75282 129 6 <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502364766,00.html\">Buy it at Bol</a></p> <p>According to the OED, a 'rebus' is 'an enigmatic representation of a name, word or phrase by figures, pictures, arrangement of letters etc, which suggest the syllables of which it is made up'. In 1987, Ian Rankin's novel Knots &amp; Crosses introduced us to a tough Edinburgh Detective Sergeant called John Rebus. A series of local girls had been kidnapped and strangled. Rebus - 41-year-old drinker, ex-soldier, failed husband, absentee father, Christian, annual rereader of Crime and Punishment - begins receiving a series of cryptic notes. The first few messages say THERE ARE CLUES EVERYWHERE. Then a message is delivered to Rebus's home: FOR THOSE WHO READ BETWEEN THE TIMES. It becomes clear that the killer has some personal connection to the detective. An Eng. Lit. professor at Edinburgh University calls Rebus to say that, as the author of Reader Exercises and Directed Exegetic Response, he has noticed that the names of the victims appear to make up a word: take the first letters of their Christian names and surnames and they spell out the word Samantha. That's a rebus; it's also the name of Rebus's daughter. He dashes off to find her but she has already been abducted by the killer, an army buddy of Rebus's who cracked during SAS training and has held a grudge against him ever since. Rebus gets there just in time to save his daughter, though not without being shot - the first of the many woundings, beatings and physical mishaps which befall him in Rankin's books.</p> <p>A new edition of the first three Rebus novels - Knots &amp; Crosses, Hide &amp; Seek, Tooth &amp; Nail - comes with an informative short introduction by Rankin about how he came to write them (Rebus: The early years (Orion, 608pp., \u00a310.99, 18 May, 0 75283 799 0). Rankin's first work, The Flood, was an autobiographical novel 'all about a teenage boy living in a Fife mining town and dreaming of escape to Edinburgh'. He gave it to his father, who read it, 'and went back to his bookshelf: James Bond, Where Eagles Dare'. So Rankin gave James Kelman's first book to his father.</p> <p>\"His sort of thing, I thought. Working-class working man against the system. Dad couldn't read it. Said it wasn't 'written in English'. Said there wasn't any story. I was shocked. This was literature. It was good for you. It was the stuff I was studying. Dad's reaction made me think about the kind of writer I wanted to be.\"</p> <p>The result was Knots &amp; Crosses, an attempt 'to update Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde to 1980s Edinburgh. My idea was: cop as good guy (Jekyll), villain as bad guy (Hyde).'</p> <p>So the Rebus books were born in a deliberate avoidance of the literary - or rather, of a certain idea of what the literary should be. Nobody wants to define 'literary fiction' for fear of sounding stupid or philistine, but at the same time everybody knows what they mean by the term. A clearness about this idea of literary fiction has helped Rankin to write books which are its opposite: novels based on character, plot and underdescribed chunks of the real world. In that sense, the received idea of 'literary fiction' is put to real use in his work. A brief summary of his trajectory as a writer would be to say that it began by being oppositional - i.e. he set out to write books that were not-literary-fiction - and then discovered that he had come upon an identity of his own, which did not depend on not-being anything. The second Rebus novel, Hide &amp; Seek, was published in 1991, the un-Rankinish four-year gap being caused by the fact that he took time out to write a spy novel and a techno-thriller. It was another attempt to use Stevenson, or to rework him, or to think about him, though it was at the same time a less literary book than Knots &amp; Crosses, which does after all turn on a single pun about rebuses. The aspect of the Jekyll and Hyde story which particularly interested Rankin was its portrayal of Edinburgh as a city of appearances and division, a place of almost structural hypocrisy. In the novel the freshly promoted Detective Inspector Rebus grows interested in a case which seems to interest no one else, the death by apparent overdose of a junkie in a squat. The case is made difficult by what appears to be general indifference but turns out to be a systematic cover-up: a number of the city's bigwigs are involved in attending an illegal boxing club called Hyde's, in which rent boys pummel each other in the ring and then have sex with the audience afterwards. Rebus breaks up the club but the cover-up is effective and no news ever gets out. Where Knots &amp; Crosses was an exploration of the formal aspect of the Jekyll and Hyde story, Hide &amp; Seek is a study of the moral implications of Stevenson's work: a study of secrecy and hypocrisy, and a vision of Edinburgh as a city in which respectability and crime rebreathe each other's air. </p> <p>Since that novel, Rankin has barely paused. It's exhausting even to list what he's done. 1992 saw the publication of Tooth &amp; Nail (or, as it was first called until the American editor came up with the improved title, Wolfman). This sent Rebus south to London, on secondment to a murder enquiry in which the killer takes a bite out of his unfortunate victims. Rankin spent time in London and hated it, so he makes Rebus hate it too, and in the course of doing so comes up with some good anti-nature writing: the River Lea is 'a place where supermarket trollies came to die, a dank stretch of water bordered on one side by marshland and on the other by industrial sites and lo-rise housing'. The mantra of the Scottish detective in London is FYTP, or Fuck You Too Pal. 1992 also brought the 12 short fictions of A Good Hanging and Other Stories, on which I can offer no comment because I haven't read it. In the same year Rankin also published another full-length Rebus novel, Strip Jack: it told the story of Gregor Jack, a likable-seeming Scots Labour MP turned over by the tabloids when he is caught in a brothel raid. After Jack's public humiliation his wife disappears, and it looks as if one of his apparently well-wishing friends is trying to destroy him. But then, as Confucius said, few pleasures in life are equal to that of seeing an old friend slip slowly off a roof . . . 1993 saw the publication of The Black Book, in which Rebus is reunited with his brother Mickey, a former stage hypnotist who went to prison for drug dealing at the end of the events described in Knots &amp; Crosses. Rebus becomes caught up in an inquiry into a mysterious hotel fire five years before, involving an unidentified body and further layers of thoroughly suppressed Edinburgh secrets. The sixth Rebus novel, Mortal Causes, published in 1994, begins with a gruesome torture-and-murder in a basement in the middle of town during the Edinburgh Festival. The victim turns out to be the son of Big Ger Cafferty, the worst gangster in town, and Rebus's investigations soon involve gun-running and Loyalist paramilitaries. 1996's Rebus novel was Let It Bleed, which opens with a car crash, continues with the apparent abduction of the Lord Provost's daughter and a shotgun suicide during a local councillor's constituency surgery, and goes on to focus on, again, systematic corruption and covering-up in Edinburgh's high places, this time involving the Scottish Development Agency.</p> <p>The division or turning-point in Rankin's career came in 1997 with the publication of Black &amp; Blue. The first Rebus books were well above average crime novels; from Black &amp; Blue onwards there is an extra sense of range and ambition about Rankin's work. Not coincidentally, this was the point at which Rankin, as publishers say, 'broke out' from his fan base to achieve genuine bestsellerdom. The book owes a great deal to Andrew O'Hagan's The Missing, a debt acknowledged by the dedication of Rankin's next novella, Death Is Not the End, the following year. O'Hagan's book told the story of a murderer known as Bible John whose deeds and, just as important, whose legend terrorised Glasgow in the mid-1960s. In Black &amp; Blue a series of copy-cat murders is being perpetrated by a killer the tabloids have dubbed Johnny Bible. Rebus, as well as following the new case, is looking over the original murders from thirty years before. A third case from twenty years ago, in which a colleague of Rebus's may have framed an innocent man, has been revived by media interest. And as the novel begins a man who works for an oil company is kidnapped, tied up, and plunges to his death on spiked railings outside a block of flats. Then Bible John himself - an oil man, we discover, long gone from Scotland - returns to take an interest in his upstart imitator. And then there is the question of the corrupt policeman Rebus encounters in Aberdeen and his efforts to block Rebus's enquiries, not to mention the detective's own escalating drink problem.</p> <p>The next two novels in the sequence, The Hanging Garden (1998) and Dead Souls (1999), are comparably ambitious in their scope, and cover subjects such as Nazi war criminals living in Scottish retirement, refugee-smuggling rackets from Bosnia, gang wars in Edinburgh's thriving drug scene, the near-fatal injuring of Rebus's daughter by a child joyrider, paedophilia and the question of how to resettle paedophile offenders after their prison terms, abuse in children's homes, vigilantism (a nicely caustic, independent-minded portrait), chequebook journalism, the redevelopment of the dockside area in Leith. The sheer range of subjects treated in the novels is one of the keys to their interest. John Rebus, born in irritation at the self-ghettoising of the literary novel, grew into a highly effective tool for describing and engaging with modern Scotland. Rankin does not indulge any temptation to play formal games with his character. There is no ludic or ironic component to the series, just as there is none to Rebus himself; the books do not experiment with the crime-novel form, and do not make any kind of distancing or Post-Modern gestures towards it. A writer who began by trying to write a book his father might want to read found himself, after the publication of Dead Souls, occupying eight of the top ten positions in the Scottish bestseller list. That is unprecedented.</p> <p>There is one sense in which Rankin is a representative figure. A large irony about late 20th-century British history was the fact that one of its few politicians to have a genuinely passionate, visceral commitment to the idea of the Union - Mrs Thatcher - did more than anyone else to undermine it. The furious rage in Scotland about rule by what seemed like a feudal power several hundred miles to the south lent unstoppable momentum to the arguments for some form of devolved assembly. James Kelman is perhaps more than anyone the writer of this historical moment, of the definition of contemporary Scottish identity as oppositionally not-English. He is, as Rebus might put it, the poet of FYTP. But as the arguments for the de-Anschlussing of Scotland gathered force, another set of questions came into play, or revived. These tended, and tend, to focus not on a Scottishness defined by its quarrel with England so much as by its internal contests and divisions. It's an old story become fresh again since the end of the Cold War: when an imperial or centralising power retreats, old arguments revive and differences reawaken. Scotland is a country with a generous share of these: Highland v. Lowland, Glasgow v. Edinburgh, Protestant v. Catholic, the Edinburgh of lawyers v. the Edinburgh of junkies, Rangers v. Celtic, Hearts v. Hibs, Rab C. Nesbitt v. John Knox. Rankin, born in 1960 and grown to artistic maturity after the Thatcherite Ragnarok, has set out systematically to write about these divisions and contests. His favourite plot device, on which almost every one of his books turns, involves the coming alive of painful secrets from the past. </p> <p>Set in Darkness, Rankin's 13th Rebus book (eleven novels, one book of stories, one novella), opens with a classically Rankinian secret-from-the-past: a body has been found behind a fireplace in a building being torn down to permit the construction of the new Scottish Parliament at Holyrood in Edinburgh. The body appears to have been immured there during building works in the late 1970s, just before the vote on devolution which - thanks to outrageous feats of governmental rigging - failed to win Scottish independence the last time around. Immediately after the discovery of this old crime, as is often the way in Rebusworld, a new crime takes place, with what may or may not be a connection to the past. Roddy Grieve, ambitious member of the Scottish Labour Party and sure-thing candidate for the new legislature when it opens ('Scottish Labour's Mr Fixit' is one nickname, 'Mr Suck-Up' another), is found bludgeoned to death, also on the site of the new Parliament.</p> <p>This introduces a whole new level of difficulty to the affair. Grieve is part of a highly visible media clan, his mother a posh old painter called Alicia Rankeillor, his sister Lorna a model famous in the 1970s, his brother Cammo a pompous Tory MP with a Home Counties constituency. So the press are all over the case, which is assigned to Rebus and an ambitious young toad of a DI called Derek Linford. Meanwhile, Rebus's onetime sidekick and prot*g*e DS Siobhan Clarke, on her way home from an unsuccessful date with Linford, sees a homeless man throw himself over North Bridge to his death. When the tramp's body is searched it turns out he is carrying a building society passbook which shows he is more than \u00a3400,000 in credit. It appears there may be some connection between the tramp and the initial murder back in the 1970s, since the tramp seems to have adopted his identity ex nihilo shortly after the man in the fireplace disappeared - and even took the dead man's name. This is not to mention the sexual assault case being investigated by Clarke, or the missing person's case Rebus is looking into on behalf of an old girlfriend in Fife for whom he is beginning to rediscover tender feelings. And what's all this about Big Ger Cafferty being released from prison with terminal cancer?</p> <p>This is just the set-up: there's plenty more narrative where that came from. Rankin is very good indeed with plot. This might sound like a rudimentary or entry-level requirement for a writer of crime fiction but in fact it is astonishing how bad much work in the genre is in this respect. Earlier I made it sound self-evident that Rankin became famous just as his books hit a new level of achievement; but that is actually a rare event. Most genre writers, from Alistair MacLean to Patricia Cornwell, go off badly once they succeed. Rankin's standards have only got higher as his books have done better. It must be a Calvinist thing.</p> <p>As, indeed, is Rankin's chief creation, DI Rebus himself. In my notes for this piece I reminded myself to make the point that Rebus's name is about the only anti-realistic touch in Rankin's work, the text's sole concession to admitting its own fictionality: not as unlikely as a Dubliner called Dedalus, but still pretty unlikely. Before making this forceful and cogent critical intervention, I thought it would be, as Gordon Brown would say, prudent, to check the Edinburgh phone book. There he is: J. Rebus. Fishily, he lives in Rankin Avenue. This might be a case of life imitating art - as Rankin points out, the site of one of the fictional Wolfman murders in London now bears a graffito saying Wolfman - or it might be whence Rankin got the name in the first place, but either way it rather spookily scuppers what was going to have been my point.</p> <p>What is unquestionably realistic about Rebus is his stuckness. A great deal happens in his life, which incidentally, and genre-defyingly, occurs in real time during the novel sequence: 41 in Knots &amp; Crosses 13 years ago, Rebus is in his mid-fifties for the opening of the Scottish Parliament. His relationship with his daughter has ups and downs, his relationships with girlfriends have downs and downs, he incarcerates Big Ger Cafferty and then more than once depends on favours done him by the gangster, he gets into varyingly severe degrees of trouble with his bosses, and has friends and colleagues get into all sorts of difficulties around him, and through all this is essentially unchanged. Of the characters we meet in the first few pages of Knots &amp; Crosses, Rebus's brother Mickey has gone to prison, come out and retrained as a therapist; Jack Morton has given up drink and cigarettes, come close to helping Rebus do the same, become his best friend, and then been killed in a shoot-out with an armed gang; Jim Stephens, a sleazeball tabloid journalist, has been murdered by a man whose story he was serialising for his paper. Rebus has had his own difficulties with drink, going from being a heavy habitual drinker to something close to a bona fide alcoholic to giving up altogether to going back on the booze to - in a startling plot twist in Set in Darkness - becoming someone who has a drink when he feels like it but tends not to overdo things. Who'd have predicted that?</p> <p>Stubbornness is Rebus's most deep-seated characteristic. All the various ways in which he could improve the quality of his life - which boil down essentially to his being less impossible - are somehow unthinkable. He stands in everybody else's way, but he stands in his own way too: difficult, determined, remorseless, honourable, honest, and proud of his lack of charm. He is a deeply Scottish self-image, in the same way that Asterix (intelligent, fair-minded, moyen sensuel, never at a loss, cunning but not malign) is a deeply French one. The lack of an attempt to be endearing is perhaps Rebus's best feature. In the forthcoming TV series the part has been given to John Hannah, a good youngish actor but one who can't prevent himself from trying to be liked, and not in any way like the sometimes-thuggish Rebus of the novels; it's the sort of move which causes people in TV to say, we've solved it in the casting, meaning, we've buggered it up.</p> <p>As for the books, there is trouble looming. The fact that the novels age their hero in real time means that Rebus is coming up to retirement. Like most of Rankin's fans I have come to feel a deep attachment to St Leonard's Police Station's least clubbable DI. But much as I would like Rebus to enjoy a comfortable retirement with an unlimited supply of Macallan and twin stacks of paperbacks and CDs to wade through, I somehow can't see it. His fate, I suspect, may be closely interlinked with that of Big Ger Cafferty, a complicated figure whose worldview has much more in common with Rebus's than the policeman would be willing to admit - and a better, more delicately drawn Hyde figure than the ones in the early books. At one point in Set in Darkness the two men meet at Warriston Crematorium. They are remembering an earlier conversation. Rebus speaks first; Cafferty refers to him by a private nickname, Strawman.</p> <p> 'You said we're a cruel race, and at the same time we like pain.'</p> <p>'We thrive on defeat, Strawman. And this Parliament will put us back in charge of our own destinies for the first time in three centuries.'</p> <p>'So?'</p> <p>'So maybe it's a time for looking forward, not back.' Cafferty stopped. His breath came out as a grey vapour. 'But you . . . you just can't leave the past alone, can you?'</p> <p>'You brought me to a garden of remembrance to tell me I'm living in the past?' Cafferty shrugged. 'We all have to live with the past; doesn't mean we have to live in it.'</p> <p>Any student of the subject can tell you that there's no point saying that to Rebus. Much more likely that in a few - preferably a good few - novels' time, a convulsive final secret will see him and Cafferty locked together, disappearing over some Caledonian equivalent of the Reichenbach Falls.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">LRB</a>.

Orion, 415 pp., \u00a316.99, 17 February, 0 75282 129 6 Buy it at Bol According to the OED, a 'rebus' is 'an enigmatic representation of a name, word or phrase by figures, pictures, arrangement of letters etc, which suggest the syllables of which it is made up'. In 1987, Ian Rankin's novel Knots &amp; Crosses introduced us to a tough Edinburgh Detective Sergeant called John Rebus. A series of local girls had been kidnapped and strangled. Rebus - 41-year-old drinker, ex-soldier, failed husband, absentee father, Christian, annual rereader of Crime and Punishment - begins receiving a series of cryptic notes. The first few messages say THERE ARE CLUES EVERYWHERE. Then a message is delivered to Rebus's home: FOR THOSE WHO READ BETWEEN THE TIMES. It becomes clear that the killer has some personal connection to the detective. An Eng. Lit. professor at Edinburgh University calls Rebus to say that, as the author of Reader Exercises and Directed Exegetic Response, he has noticed that the names of the victims appear to make up a word: take the first letters of their Christian names and surnames and they spell out the word Samantha. That's a rebus; it's also the name of Rebus's daughter. He dashes off to find her but she has already been abducted by the killer, an army buddy of Rebus's who cracked during SAS training and has held a grudge against him ever since. Rebus gets there just in time to save his daughter, though not without being shot - the first of the many woundings, beatings and physical mishaps which befall him in Rankin's books. A new edition of the first three Rebus novels - Knots &amp; Crosses, Hide &amp; Seek, Tooth &amp; Nail - comes with an informative short introduction by Rankin about how he came to write them (Rebus: The early years (Orion, 608pp., \u00a310.99, 18 May, 0 75283 799 0). Rankin's first work, The Flood, was an autobiographical novel 'all about a teenage boy living in a Fife mining town and dreaming of escape to Edinburgh'. He gave it to his father, who read it, 'and went back to his bookshelf: James Bond, Where Eagles Dare'. So Rankin gave James Kelman's first book to his father. \"His sort of thing, I thought. Working-class working man against the system. Dad couldn't read it. Said it wasn't 'written in English'. Said there wasn't any story. I was shocked. This was literature. It was good for you. It was the stuff I was studying. Dad's reaction made me think about the kind of writer I wanted to be.\" The result was Knots &amp; Crosses, an attempt 'to update Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde to 1980s Edinburgh. My idea was: cop as good guy (Jekyll), villain as bad guy (Hyde).' So the Rebus books were born in a deliberate avoidance of the literary - or rather, of a certain idea of what the literary should be. Nobody wants to define 'literary fiction' for fear of sounding stupid or philistine, but at the same time everybody knows what they mean by the term. A clearness about this idea of literary fiction has helped Rankin to write books which are its opposite: novels based on character, plot and underdescribed chunks of the real world. In that sense, the received idea of 'literary fiction' is put to real use in his work. A brief summary of his trajectory as a writer would be to say that it began by being oppositional - i.e. he set out to write books that were not-literary-fiction - and then discovered that he had come upon an identity of his own, which did not depend on not-being anything. The second Rebus novel, Hide &amp; Seek, was published in 1991, the un-Rankinish four-year gap being caused by the fact that he took time out to write a spy novel and a techno-thriller.

A great deal happens in his life, which incidentally, and genre-defyingly, occurs in real time during the novel sequence: 41 in Knots &amp; Crosses 13 years ago, Rebus is in his mid-fifties for the opening of the Scottish Parliament. His relationship with his daughter has ups and downs, his relationships with girlfriends have downs and downs, he incarcerates Big Ger Cafferty and then more than once depends on favours done him by the gangster, he gets into varyingly severe degrees of trouble with his bosses, and has friends and colleagues get into all sorts of difficulties around him, and through all this is essentially unchanged. Of the characters we meet in the first few pages of Knots &amp; Crosses, Rebus's brother Mickey has gone to prison, come out and retrained as a therapist; Jack Morton has given up drink and cigarettes, come close to helping Rebus do the same, become his best friend, and then been killed in a shoot-out with an armed gang; Jim Stephens, a sleazeball tabloid journalist, has been murdered by a man whose story he was serialising for his paper. Rebus has had his own difficulties with drink, going from being a heavy habitual drinker to something close to a bona fide alcoholic to giving up altogether to going back on the booze to - in a startling plot twist in Set in Darkness - becoming someone who has a drink when he feels like it but tends not to overdo things. Who'd have predicted that? Stubbornness is Rebus's most deep-seated characteristic. All the various ways in which he could improve the quality of his life - which boil down essentially to his being less impossible - are somehow unthinkable. He stands in everybody else's way, but he stands in his own way too: difficult, determined, remorseless, honourable, honest, and proud of his lack of charm. He is a deeply Scottish self-image, in the same way that Asterix (intelligent, fair-minded, moyen sensuel, never at a loss, cunning but not malign) is a deeply French one. The lack of an attempt to be endearing is perhaps Rebus's best feature. In the forthcoming TV series the part has been given to John Hannah, a good youngish actor but one who can't prevent himself from trying to be liked, and not in any way like the sometimes-thuggish Rebus of the novels; it's the sort of move which causes people in TV to say, we've solved it in the casting, meaning, we've buggered it up. As for the books, there is trouble looming. The fact that the novels age their hero in real time means that Rebus is coming up to retirement. Like most of Rankin's fans I have come to feel a deep attachment to St Leonard's Police Station's least clubbable DI. But much as I would like Rebus to enjoy a comfortable retirement with an unlimited supply of Macallan and twin stacks of paperbacks and CDs to wade through, I somehow can't see it. His fate, I suspect, may be closely interlinked with that of Big Ger Cafferty, a complicated figure whose worldview has much more in common with Rebus's than the policeman would be willing to admit - and a better, more delicately drawn Hyde figure than the ones in the early books. At one point in Set in Darkness the two men meet at Warriston Crematorium. They are remembering an earlier conversation. Rebus speaks first; Cafferty refers to him by a private nickname, Strawman. 'You said we're a cruel race, and at the same time we like pain.' 'We thrive on defeat, Strawman. And this Parliament will put us back in charge of our own destinies for the first time in three centuries.' 'So?' 'So maybe it's a time for looking forward, not back.' Cafferty stopped. His breath came out as a grey vapour. 'But you . . . you just can't leave the past alone, can you?' 'You brought me to a garden of remembrance to tell me I'm living in the past?' Cafferty shrugged. 'We all have to live with the past; doesn't mean we have to live in it.' Any student of the subject can tell you that there's no point saying that to Rebus. Much more likely that in a few - preferably a good few - novels' time, a convulsive final secret will see him and Cafferty locked together, disappearing over some Caledonian equivalent of the Reichenbach Falls. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair condemned the attacks on white farmers in Zimbabwe as \"barbaric\" today - but rejected opposition calls for Britain to intervene directly in the growing crisis.</p> <p>Challenged at prime minister's question time by the Tory leader, William Hague, Mr Blair said that the situation was \"totally and utterly unacceptable\". He said the government was pursuing \"every avenue open to us\" to restore order, but added that it was important to help people in Zimbabwe, and not make the situation worse for them.</p> <p>\"It is a difficult balance to strike,\" he told the Commons. \"We want to take any action that is helpful.\"</p> <p>Mr Hague said that it was time for the Commonwealth to consider suspending Zimbabwe's membership, and suggested that the government could investigate the possibility of freezing the assets of the country's president, Robert Mugabe.</p> <p>\"Is it not at such moments that the Commonwealth family of nations comes into its own?\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Blair said that people in Zimbabwe were warning against any emotional reaction or interference. The prime minister told MPs: \"It is best we are guided with those with most to lose - not those commenting from a safe distance.\"</p> <p>\"We are in touch not just with other African leaders in the area, but also with those people who represent the opposition in Zimbabwe and the farmers' union in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"I think they are important people to consult. I think it is important we take their advice and we are acting in accordance with it,\" he said.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, warned that action such as the imposition of sanctions from the international community could entrench Mr Mugabe's position and give credence to his claims of British colonialism and outside interference. He urged Mr Blair to assure farmers or politicians fleeing Zimbabwe that they would not be put into detention camps.</p> <p>The prime minister replied that it was important that the asylum issue was dealt with in a \"responsible manner\".</p> <p><b>Government spending:</b> Mr Blair today labelled Tory attempts to criticise increases in government spending as pathetic. He said that \"Hague-onomics\" was beginning to be found out and by the end of the next election would be in ruins \"along with his party\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair condemned the attacks on white farmers in Zimbabwe as \"barbaric\" today - but rejected opposition calls for Britain to intervene directly in the growing crisis. Challenged at prime minister's question time by the Tory leader, William Hague, Mr Blair said that the situation was \"totally and utterly unacceptable\". He said the government was pursuing \"every avenue open to us\" to restore order, but added that it was important to help people in Zimbabwe, and not make the situation worse for them. \"It is a difficult balance to strike,\" he told the Commons. \"We want to take any action that is helpful.\" Mr Hague said that it was time for the Commonwealth to consider suspending Zimbabwe's membership, and suggested that the government could investigate the possibility of freezing the assets of the country's president, Robert Mugabe. \"Is it not at such moments that the Commonwealth family of nations comes into its own?\" he said. Mr Blair said that people in Zimbabwe were warning against any emotional reaction or interference. The prime minister told MPs: \"It is best we are guided with those with most to lose - not those commenting from a safe distance.\" \"We are in touch not just with other African leaders in the area, but also with those people who represent the opposition in Zimbabwe and the farmers' union in Zimbabwe. \"I think they are important people to consult. I think it is important we take their advice and we are acting in accordance with it,\" he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, warned that action such as the imposition of sanctions from the international community could entrench Mr Mugabe's position and give credence to his claims of British colonialism and outside interference. He urged Mr Blair to assure farmers or politicians fleeing Zimbabwe that they would not be put into detention camps. The prime minister replied that it was important that the asylum issue was dealt with in a \"responsible manner\". Government spending: Mr Blair today labelled Tory attempts to criticise increases in government spending as pathetic. He said that \"Hague-onomics\" was beginning to be found out and by the end of the next election would be in ruins \"along with his party\".",

      "bodyText": "A book variously panned as \"airhead mush\" and \"Bridget Jones without the brains\" has been shortlisted for the controversial Orange Prize. The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, by the actress Rebecca Wells, has received mountains of highly critical reviews but its feelgood plot, which centres on a group of women growing up together in New Orleans, has nonetheless become an international bestseller. The book has even spawned a network of \"sisterhood\" groups, in which women gather to talk about their lives in the same way as the characters in the book. Fans call themselves Ya-Yas and refer to each other as Dahlins, in deference to the novel's gossipy southern belles. Last night Bonnie Greer, a member of the judging panel for the women-only prize, defended the decision to shortlist a novel that she conceded was a \"genre book\" for Britain's richest literary award. \"You should not always be confined by the strictures of high literature.

Neither did Julia Leigh's first novel, The Hunter - about a man who goes in search of the extinct Tasmanian tiger - despite ecstatic reviews. Despite the populist appeal of the Ya-Ya phenomenon, the clear favourite is Zadie Smith's White Teeth, a sprawling dispatch from multicultural London. The Guardian writer Linda Grant's When I Lived in Modern Times, set during the creation of Israel, is also widely tipped. Ms Greer said the judges - who include Ffion Hague, the wife of the Tory party leader William Hague - had gone for \"strong voices\". \"We did not know about Ya-Ya groups, but it shows that it has struck a chord.

Last year the chair of the judges, Lola Young, caused a storm by comparing British fiction writers unfavourably with Americans. The full shortlist is: If I Told You Once, by Judy Budnitz; When I Lived in Modern Times, by Linda Grant; The Dancers Dancing, by \u00c9ilis Ni Dhuibhne; White Teeth, by Zadie Smith; Amy and Isabelle by Elizabeth Strout; The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, by Rebecca Wells. \u0095 The winner will be announced on June 6.

      "body": "<p><strong>Could you tell me the name of the last Manchester City player to score 30 or more goals in a season; and whether the club has previously achieved back-to-back promotions at any point in its history?</strong> asks Richard Sealby</p> <p>Francis Lee is your man - he was the top scorer in the old First Division with 33 league goals in 1971-2. His total included 13 penalties, the most ever scored by a player in a single league season. Just for the record, City's top league haul was achieved by Tommy Johnson, who netted 38 top-flight goals in 1928-9. And to think he's still banging them in for Celtic.</p> <p>As for back-to-back promotions - seeing last season's sojurn into the Second Division was the first time City have sunk so low, they've never before needed to climb more than one division to reach the top flight. So if they manage a second promotion in a row this season it'll be a Maine Road first.</p> <p><strong>Did Nobby Stiles ever score for England?</strong> asks Carl Keszei</p> <p>Yes he did. Nobby played 28 times for England but only scored one goal, which came against West Germany in a friendly at Wembley in February 1966. Perhaps unsurprisingly it was a scrambled affair from close range, although it did bring England a 1-0 win against their future World Cup final opponents.</p> <p>The former Manchester United star is now earning a living on the lucrative after-dinner circuit, where he appears with Tommy Smith MBE and Norman Hunter under the banner 'The Hardmen of Soccer.' The players are also available for office and store openings and charity dinners. Anyone wanting further details should contact MBN promotions on <a href=\"http://www.mbnpromotions.co.uk/speakers.htm\">http://www.mbnpromotions.co.uk/speakers.htm</a>.</p> <p><strong>Mark Hughes will become the third on Friday, but can you name the only other two current Premiership players to have played in both a Merseyside and a Manchester derby?</strong> asks Charlotte Freemantle</p> <p>In fact there are three current Premiership players who have had a derby run-out in the colours of both Everton and Manchester City. Peter Beagrie of Bradford and Sheffield Wednesday's Andy Hinchcliffe are two. And did you know that Middlesbrough's Paul Ince once played for both Manchester United and Liverpool? </p> <p><strong>I have heard it said that the 1966 World Cup should have seen England playing their semi-final at Villa Park as opposed to Wembley, the host nation thereby stopped from playing all games at 'home.' The fan that informed me of this fact had actually booked the tickets in advance but ended up watching USSR v.W.Germany. Is this true?</strong> asks a demanding Richard Sealby</p> <p>Your friend is certainly on the right lines. According to the book England: The Quest for the World Cup by Clive Leatherdale, \"Controversy attended the choice of venue for the semi-final.

      "bodyText": "Could you tell me the name of the last Manchester City player to score 30 or more goals in a season; and whether the club has previously achieved back-to-back promotions at any point in its history? asks Richard Sealby Francis Lee is your man - he was the top scorer in the old First Division with 33 league goals in 1971-2. His total included 13 penalties, the most ever scored by a player in a single league season. Just for the record, City's top league haul was achieved by Tommy Johnson, who netted 38 top-flight goals in 1928-9. And to think he's still banging them in for Celtic. As for back-to-back promotions - seeing last season's sojurn into the Second Division was the first time City have sunk so low, they've never before needed to climb more than one division to reach the top flight. So if they manage a second promotion in a row this season it'll be a Maine Road first. Did Nobby Stiles ever score for England? asks Carl Keszei Yes he did. Nobby played 28 times for England but only scored one goal, which came against West Germany in a friendly at Wembley in February 1966. Perhaps unsurprisingly it was a scrambled affair from close range, although it did bring England a 1-0 win against their future World Cup final opponents. The former Manchester United star is now earning a living on the lucrative after-dinner circuit, where he appears with Tommy Smith MBE and Norman Hunter under the banner 'The Hardmen of Soccer.' The players are also available for office and store openings and charity dinners. Anyone wanting further details should contact MBN promotions on http://www.mbnpromotions.co.uk/speakers.htm. Mark Hughes will become the third on Friday, but can you name the only other two current Premiership players to have played in both a Merseyside and a Manchester derby? asks Charlotte Freemantle In fact there are three current Premiership players who have had a derby run-out in the colours of both Everton and Manchester City. Peter Beagrie of Bradford and Sheffield Wednesday's Andy Hinchcliffe are two. And did you know that Middlesbrough's Paul Ince once played for both Manchester United and Liverpool? I have heard it said that the 1966 World Cup should have seen England playing their semi-final at Villa Park as opposed to Wembley, the host nation thereby stopped from playing all games at 'home.' The fan that informed me of this fact had actually booked the tickets in advance but ended up watching USSR v.W.Germany. Is this true? asks a demanding Richard Sealby Your friend is certainly on the right lines. According to the book England: The Quest for the World Cup by Clive Leatherdale, \"Controversy attended the choice of venue for the semi-final. The pre-tournament blurb stated that this particular semi-final, irrespective of who would contest it, would be staged at Goodison.Park. Some punters had bought tickets in advance in the expectation that if England were still in the running they would be heading for Merseyside. Fifa's organising committee now insisted that it had all along reserved the right to reallocate the semi-final venues. Portugal had been based in the north-west zone and had beaten Brazil and North Korea at Everton. England, on the other hand, had yet to move from Wembley.

She reaches forward. \"Now imagine you're stirring food in a big round cauldron... first to the right... then to the left.\" Apart from one or two giggles, the children are absorbed. </p> <p>It sounds like a game, but Flisek-Boyle is an expert in dharma yoga, and she is introducing the children to a holistic exercise and breathing regime that calms them down, helps them concentrate and could prevent future health problems. This is just one class at a community centre in north London, where the children share a class with pensioners, but Flisek-Boyle has far bigger plans - she is a founder member of Body Awareness, a new organisation campaigning for yoga to be made part of the school curriculum. </p> <p>Flisek-Boyle began teaching yoga at Gospel Oak primary school in north London in 1997. \"I noticed my son's teacher was using yogic tech niques during storytime to settle the kids. I asked him if I could take a session with them, which went down very well. Within a fortnight I was taking four classes.\" </p> <p>Flisek-Boyle was surprised at how restricted children were in their movement, with hunched shoulders, stiffness and an inability to sit upright. Children as young as four are now being given treatment for back problems normally associated with computer operators. Computer games are causing bad postural habits, a problem worsened by poorly designed school furniture which is often too small. By the age of seven, children are storing up problems for later in life. </p> <p>The experts say that, with its holistic approach to health, yoga is an ideal way to improve posture, correct physical problems and reduce stress. Madonna is one of yoga's most famous practitioners, but Flisek-Boyle insists it is not just the preserve of glamorous superstars. It's a technique that should be available to all ages and abilities, from toddlers to the elderly. </p> <p>Backcare (formerly the Back Pain Association) reports that in 1997-8 more than 119m working days a year were lost because of registered back problems. Taking into account those who don't claim sickness benefit, the total estimate could be nearer 180m days. As approximately \u00a3480m is spent by the NHS on services used by people with back pain, campaigners say it makes sense to fund preventative exercise such as school yoga. \"After a few months of regular weekly yoga, children are much less restricted,\" says Flisek-Boyle. </p> <p>The effects go beyond the merely physical. Eight-year-old Mukuba was a withdrawn, traumatised refugee from Zaire who hardly spoke. Within months of doing yoga at school, she started to talk. \"She suddenly blossomed like a flower. She was beautiful, elegant and she really came out of herself,\" says Flisek-Boyle. </p> <p>Teachers at the school report a marked improvement in children's ability to concentrate after they have taken yoga classes, while parents say that they are calmer at home. Even the most difficult children respond. Members of a special-needs group, for instance, could barely concentrate during their first few sessions, but now they can for at least part of the time. \"Other children give it attitude, suggesting they're too cool to do yoga. They stand there defiantly with one hand on the hip. But that changes; they gradually drop the pose,\" says Flisek-Boyle. </p> <p>After she had begun work with primary pupils, Flisek-Boyle asked osteopaths and other yoga teachers to come in to observe the children. \"I talked to my GP, and got funding to set up Body Awareness.\" The psychosocial and physiological department at East London University is now preparing a full-scale 18-month research study into the impact of yoga on children. </p> <p>The response from teachers and parents has been overwhelmingly positive, although \"one mother wouldn't let her child participate because I burned incense,\" says Flisek-Boyle, who now keeps the sessions patchouli-free. </p> <p>The emphasis is on the physical, with gentle nudgings towards a holistic understanding of mind and body. At a class funded by Kingsway College in a Camden community centre, Flisek-Boyle teaches children and pensioners together. When the children come in, they fidget and chatter excitedly. But within minutes, their eyes are closed and they're sitting with hands in their laps. \"Be aware of the sound of your breath,\" Flisek-Boyle says gently. \"Be aware of the sense of taste in your mouth.\" She teaches them simple breathing and stretching exercises to loosen up joints and muscles in the body. </p> <p>Afterwards the children rush to the table for lunch. In between crisps, Chelsea, nine, says solemnly: \"I've been doing yoga for about three months and I really like it. My mum says that before I do it I look really hard, and when I come home I'm very relaxed.\" Her mother, Amanda Johnston, adds: \"Chelsea's very hyper - she can never sit still, she finds it hard to switch off. I've noticed that the yoga has a calming effect on her, and she really looks forward to it.\" </p> <p>Eight-year-old Aaron, wearing a football strip and trainers, finds that yoga improves his football. \"I play better. I'm less stiff,\" he says with a grin. Yasmine, nine, likes the relaxation best. \"At school I'm very tense, and yoga is the only time I can really relax. My mum says that she might do it now.\" </p> <p>In classes children are taught basic anatomy and encouraged to look at alignment and physical restrictions. They do detective work in pairs, noticing each other's body shape, observing and evaluating each other. Some of those who do the classes say they are teaching their siblings relaxation and visualisation techniques at home; some are so enthralled with it they practise in the playground. </p> <p>Flisek-Boyle says that she could have benefited from yoga at school. Now 39, she discovered it at the age of 15, and within 10 years was beginning to teach it full time. With Body Awareness, she and co-founder Annie Calverley are aiming to \"de-stigmatise\" yoga, and bring it from the new age arena of smells and bells to the centre of the community. The organisation is up and running, but despite a small grant from Camden education authority it will soon need more funding (in the region of \u00a335,000) to continue this pioneering work. </p> <p>\"When I was in my early 20s my father died and my brother committed suicide seven months later. I don't know what I would have done without yoga at the time - it was my rock,\" says Flisek-Boyle. \"It's something that can strengthen the mental as well as physical, for everybody.\" For more information on Body Awareness 2000+, call 020-7697 8512 or email <a href=\"mailto:khapaga@flashmail.com\">khapaga@flashmail.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>If the field of psychology rests on a need to understand odd behaviour, there is one circumstance that defies it: the child killed by its parent is persistently regarded, outside of the scientific community, as an incomprehensible anomaly. The reflex emotional response to a case such as that of the two boys, Christopher and Oliver Fairless, killed by their father in Lincolnshire this week, is that it must have been an act of random lunacy, an expression of derangement that can't be fitted into a wider pattern or mitigated by commonality. </p> <p>The clinical response is more disturbing. It identifies a thread of behaviour that links the two boys' deaths to other killings that, although relatively few and far between, share enough characteristics to approach the level of a syndrome. </p> <p>Christopher and Oliver's father, Frank Fairless, had recently split up with their mother, Claire. The self-employed builder faced losing the children, nine and six, in a custody battle and after killing his sons, killed himself. \"My experience of these revenge-type killings of a child by a separated father is that they are often perpetrated by people who have appeared to be relatively normal, before the murder,\" says Dr Christopher Cordess, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Sheffield. </p> <p>Dr Cordess is currently assessing a man whose estranged wife has identified him as a possible threat to their children. \"He is slightly dependent, he can't accept that the marriage is over and someone else has moved in with his ex-wife and is now the father of the children. Often, the issue in these cases is not the man's failure to accept his ex-wife's new marriage, but to accept that he has lost his kids to another man. If there is no history of violence, it is difficult to make a prediction.\" </p> <p>Statistically, the Fairless brothers were at low risk of being killed by their parents. Every year, between 70 and 100 children in England and Wales are murdered, the majority of them under the age of one and by their parents. Neonaticide, the killing of a baby in its first 24 hours of life, is most commonly perpetrated by the mother, but in the first year of its life, there is an even divide between babies killed by the mother and father. By the time a child is in its infancy, however, there has been a shift towards the culpability of the father. </p> <p>\"The motives are quite different when older children are killed by their parents,\" says Maureen Marks of the Maudsley Institute of Psychiatry. \"For younger ones, it's most frequently a case of someone losing their temper with the children. When an older child is killed, the parent is more likely to be mentally ill.\" Within this category is a sub-division of children killed by their father in an apparent act of revenge against their mother - usually in the context of a bitter custody battle. </p> <p>In October 1999, David Price from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, gassed his eight-year-old daughter, his six-year-old son and himself, after splitting up with their mother. Two weeks previously, Peter Stafford had murdered his sons, aged six and two, his seven-year old-daughter and his 27-year-old wife, before killing himself in a house in Birmingham. His wife had walked out on him two weeks before. In April 1999, Stephen Carter, a factory manager from Weaver Hills, Staffordshire, killed himself and his three children after the break-up of his marriage. \"Carter wanted to destroy everything he held of great value in his life,\" said the coroner, John Wain. \"Regrettably, this included his own children.\" </p> <p>Forensic psychiatrists estimate that, in Britain, there are roughly 10 children murdered in this fashion every year and that it is a vastly under-researched area. \"If the estimated figures are right,\" says Dr Todd Hogue, a consultant psychologist, \"it is more likely that your partner is going to kill your children when you leave him than that they are going to be killed by a stranger in the park.\" </p> <p>The agonising factor in most of these killings is that the men who carry them out do not have a history of abusing their children, but maintain a love for them that is almost pathological. Police say there was no advance warning that Frank Fairless would harm his children. In 1994, Dr Sukhdev Sandhu strangled his two children before jumping from a tower block and killing himself. He had just learned that his estranged wife was seeing another man. \"That their father could ever hurt them is unbelievable,\" said his wife, \"but that he could end their lives is beyond comprehension.\" In February last year, Kenneth McKay of Fleetwood, Lancashire, cut the throats of his two children, who survived, and killed himself. \"He had used violence before,\" said his ex-partner Tanya, \"but he had never touched the children.\" </p> <p>Experts insist, however, that the signs of latent mental illness are readable well before the crime is committed, without violence entering into it. \"If a psychotherapist had talked to these people before, they would have known that they were capable of this,\" says Maureen Marks. \"They would have noticed how the person reacted to things not going their way, how being spurned by the one they loved could stir up this rage.\" </p> <p>They might have noticed that the father was mildly obsessive, that his identity was too dependent on his role as a provider, as the traditional man of the house, to withstand a seismic alteration.\"In retrospect, you'll say that these are very abnormal people,\" says Dr Cordess. \"Not abnormal in that they have a psychiatric illness, but that they are possibly dependent men who can't imagine living alone, who regard their wives as possessions. They might describe their situation in the rubric of a stalker: that they can't fall out of love with their ex-wife, that she's a wonderful woman, therefore they follow everywhere. She experiences this as demonisation, but they might kill her saying they love her, they love her to bits.\" </p> <p>The propensity of the courts to award custody to the mother has made this a father's crime. But there are occasionally cases involving the mother. In 1995, Susan Smith, 23, from South Carolina, USA, drove her car into a lake, drowning her two young sons. Smith, estranged from her husband David, concocted a story about the children being kidnapped, before admitting that she had killed them herself. The case attracted worldwide attention as Smith faced the death penalty. </p> <p>In the event, she was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, but a mitigating factor in her defence was the implication that she had tried to kill herself that day, too.

      "bodyText": "If the field of psychology rests on a need to understand odd behaviour, there is one circumstance that defies it: the child killed by its parent is persistently regarded, outside of the scientific community, as an incomprehensible anomaly. The reflex emotional response to a case such as that of the two boys, Christopher and Oliver Fairless, killed by their father in Lincolnshire this week, is that it must have been an act of random lunacy, an expression of derangement that can't be fitted into a wider pattern or mitigated by commonality. The clinical response is more disturbing. It identifies a thread of behaviour that links the two boys' deaths to other killings that, although relatively few and far between, share enough characteristics to approach the level of a syndrome. Christopher and Oliver's father, Frank Fairless, had recently split up with their mother, Claire. The self-employed builder faced losing the children, nine and six, in a custody battle and after killing his sons, killed himself. \"My experience of these revenge-type killings of a child by a separated father is that they are often perpetrated by people who have appeared to be relatively normal, before the murder,\" says Dr Christopher Cordess, professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Sheffield. Dr Cordess is currently assessing a man whose estranged wife has identified him as a possible threat to their children. \"He is slightly dependent, he can't accept that the marriage is over and someone else has moved in with his ex-wife and is now the father of the children. Often, the issue in these cases is not the man's failure to accept his ex-wife's new marriage, but to accept that he has lost his kids to another man. If there is no history of violence, it is difficult to make a prediction.\" Statistically, the Fairless brothers were at low risk of being killed by their parents. Every year, between 70 and 100 children in England and Wales are murdered, the majority of them under the age of one and by their parents. Neonaticide, the killing of a baby in its first 24 hours of life, is most commonly perpetrated by the mother, but in the first year of its life, there is an even divide between babies killed by the mother and father. By the time a child is in its infancy, however, there has been a shift towards the culpability of the father. \"The motives are quite different when older children are killed by their parents,\" says Maureen Marks of the Maudsley Institute of Psychiatry. \"For younger ones, it's most frequently a case of someone losing their temper with the children. When an older child is killed, the parent is more likely to be mentally ill.\" Within this category is a sub-division of children killed by their father in an apparent act of revenge against their mother - usually in the context of a bitter custody battle. In October 1999, David Price from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, gassed his eight-year-old daughter, his six-year-old son and himself, after splitting up with their mother. Two weeks previously, Peter Stafford had murdered his sons, aged six and two, his seven-year old-daughter and his 27-year-old wife, before killing himself in a house in Birmingham. His wife had walked out on him two weeks before.

      "bodyText": "Frank Dobson, Labour Housing Labour's mayoral challenger wants to introduce 10,000 new low-cost homes for teachers and nurses to attract skilled staff who have been priced out of the capital's housing market back to London. He also promises to provide 80% of households with internet connections by 2004. Health Mr Dobson, a former health secretary, has launched plans for a London-wide lottery to raise up to \u00a3100m a year for health and education schemes in the capital. He says he will channel money raised from a weekly lottery to health and education projects such as specialist hospital equipment, care for old people, summer schools and homework clubs. He also wants a dedicated medical officer for London. Environment Mr Dobson argues that practical sustainable development comes through improving public transport and regenerating deprived areas - partly through reducing crime. His stated environmental priorities are to defend the green belt and promote the recycling of land through conversion or rebuilding on brownfield sites. Business Wants to see corporate tax on London firms cut as a way of increasing investment and jobs and has set a target of 100,000 more jobs in London within the next four years. He will also set up a task force to tackle black and Asian unemployment.

All you have to do is send a joining fee of \u00a315. </p> <p>But when Joe Mann, a trading standards officer, responded to the advert as part of an investigation into the scheme, he received a bag of roughly cut plywood, a tube of glue and some indecipherable instructions. Unable to assemble a single box, he was forced to forfeit his joining fee. </p> <p>The scam may seem painfully obvious, but last year saw an increase of over 60% in the numbers of desperate house-bound workers seduced by misleading get-rich-quick offers, according to the National Group on Homeworking. </p> <p>Responding to adverts in the classified columns of newspapers, on supermarket bulletin boards, or flyers strapped to traffic-light poles, more and more of the estimated 1m homeworkers in Britain are being duped out of an up-front \"registration fee\" - or, if they complete the work, are receiving a pittance for their efforts. </p> <p>Linda Devereux, director of NGH, says that the number of complaints against firms offering employment in the home increased from 6,737 in 1998 to 11,107 last year, but represented just a fraction of the total number of vulnerable homeworkers being targeted. </p> <p>\"Our phonelines are jammed and the calls we get are just the tip of the iceberg,\" she says. \"We received 174 complaints about one company, but later found it had taken over 103,000 up-front payments in response to an advertisement campaign. </p> <p>\"Because regular homeworkers desperately need an income, many are afraid to complain when they get less than they hoped for from their wage packets. </p> <p>\"They are normally paid according to their output, based on a fair estimate of what can be achieved in an hour. On paper, this often works out slightly over the minimum wage. In practice, the estimates are unachievable and the homeworkers earn much less.\" </p> <p>Vanessa Griffiths, a trading standards officer in Cheshire, says the increasing number of companies advertising misleading homeworking schemes makes legal action difficult. </p> <p>\"With one or two exceptions, it is a small number of complaints against a large number of companies,\" she says. \"In most cases, the level of complaints and the amounts concerned are not enough for trading standards officers to justify enforcement action.\" </p> <p>Private action through small claims courts was often equally fruitless and potential claimants could be put off by the cost of litigation, with no guarantee of getting their money back. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which has seen complaints about homeworking scams treble in the past two years, says adverts offering vast sums of money for what appears to be very little work were still very common. </p> <p>\"As a result, we asked for the withdrawal of 13 adverts for homeworking schemes in 1999,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, the growing number of leaflet drops and postcards in shop windows are not covered by our regulations.\" </p> <p>Trade secretary Stephen Byers's \"modern markets\" white paper last year recognised that current laws on fair trading were failing some homeworkers, and a spokeswoman for the DTI confirms that various ways of tackling the problem are still being considered. </p> <p>Until then, homeworkers are told: if a job advert looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p> <p><strong>Poor rewards</strong></p> <p>Vanessa Wood recently gave up her job as a homeworker for Industrial Rubber Mouldings plc after six years. She says the final straw came when she was given a batch of particularly intricate work and was paid just \u00a39 for what took her more than 11 hours to complete. </p> <p>Three times a week, Wood, 36, from Gosport in Hampshire, took delivery of various rubber components from IRM - including stoppers for walking sticks and seals for gas-masks or inflatable lifeboats - and trimmed them to size in her living room. She says that the job had suited her circumstances as a mother of two young girls and kept her occupied when her husband, who is in the navy, was away. </p> <p>\"I can remember on some occasions, when my husband was at sea, that I'd work until the kids came in from school, then I would start work again about 9pm and carry on right through till about 3am,\" she says. \"By the third night, I'd be absolutely shattered and have to go to bed at a reasonable time and then get up the following morning and rush like mad to get all the work done.\" </p> <p>Wood fell out with IRM last year when they appeared to be disregarding new national minimum wage legislation. </p> <p>Despite being an experienced trimmer, she has calculated that she never earned more than \u00a32.50 an hour, because she couldn't keep up with IRM's estimated work rates.</p>",

Responding to adverts in the classified columns of newspapers, on supermarket bulletin boards, or flyers strapped to traffic-light poles, more and more of the estimated 1m homeworkers in Britain are being duped out of an up-front \"registration fee\" - or, if they complete the work, are receiving a pittance for their efforts. Linda Devereux, director of NGH, says that the number of complaints against firms offering employment in the home increased from 6,737 in 1998 to 11,107 last year, but represented just a fraction of the total number of vulnerable homeworkers being targeted. \"Our phonelines are jammed and the calls we get are just the tip of the iceberg,\" she says. \"We received 174 complaints about one company, but later found it had taken over 103,000 up-front payments in response to an advertisement campaign. \"Because regular homeworkers desperately need an income, many are afraid to complain when they get less than they hoped for from their wage packets. \"They are normally paid according to their output, based on a fair estimate of what can be achieved in an hour. On paper, this often works out slightly over the minimum wage. In practice, the estimates are unachievable and the homeworkers earn much less.\" Vanessa Griffiths, a trading standards officer in Cheshire, says the increasing number of companies advertising misleading homeworking schemes makes legal action difficult. \"With one or two exceptions, it is a small number of complaints against a large number of companies,\" she says. \"In most cases, the level of complaints and the amounts concerned are not enough for trading standards officers to justify enforcement action.\" Private action through small claims courts was often equally fruitless and potential claimants could be put off by the cost of litigation, with no guarantee of getting their money back. A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which has seen complaints about homeworking scams treble in the past two years, says adverts offering vast sums of money for what appears to be very little work were still very common. \"As a result, we asked for the withdrawal of 13 adverts for homeworking schemes in 1999,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, the growing number of leaflet drops and postcards in shop windows are not covered by our regulations.\" Trade secretary Stephen Byers's \"modern markets\" white paper last year recognised that current laws on fair trading were failing some homeworkers, and a spokeswoman for the DTI confirms that various ways of tackling the problem are still being considered. Until then, homeworkers are told: if a job advert looks too good to be true, it probably is. Poor rewards Vanessa Wood recently gave up her job as a homeworker for Industrial Rubber Mouldings plc after six years. She says the final straw came when she was given a batch of particularly intricate work and was paid just \u00a39 for what took her more than 11 hours to complete. Three times a week, Wood, 36, from Gosport in Hampshire, took delivery of various rubber components from IRM - including stoppers for walking sticks and seals for gas-masks or inflatable lifeboats - and trimmed them to size in her living room. She says that the job had suited her circumstances as a mother of two young girls and kept her occupied when her husband, who is in the navy, was away. \"I can remember on some occasions, when my husband was at sea, that I'd work until the kids came in from school, then I would start work again about 9pm and carry on right through till about 3am,\" she says. \"By the third night, I'd be absolutely shattered and have to go to bed at a reasonable time and then get up the following morning and rush like mad to get all the work done.\" Wood fell out with IRM last year when they appeared to be disregarding new national minimum wage legislation. Despite being an experienced trimmer, she has calculated that she never earned more than \u00a32.50 an hour, because she couldn't keep up with IRM's estimated work rates.",

Officially, of course, the IMF doesn't 'impose' anything. It 'negotiates' the conditions for receiving aid.

The FHA's director, Jenny Stephenson, had agreed to take on the challenge of turning a dream into reality: the dream of John Carter - at the time, the face of TV's Wish You Were Here - to offer a holiday to every child looked after in residential care homes by UK local authorities in the year 2000. The project was called Time2Care. </p> <p>With the help of a well-known travel industry personality, Jeremy Muller, and the Abta president, Steven Freudmann, all the country's best known tour operators, including Airtours, Cosmos, First Choice, JMC, Panorama and Thomson, responded magnficently to the Time2Care appeal, as did PGL Adventure Holidays, British Holidays, and the Football Trust (for football holidays). Astonishingly, enough holidays for about 7,000 young people and carers have been donated, and Lunn Poly have dedicated a special bookings service free of charge. </p> <p>The Association of Train Operating Companies, representing 25 different rail companies, also stepped in to offer, for the first time, national support for a charitable project, giving all Time2Care participants free rail travel to their holiday. And Travel &amp; Personal Underwriters and Citybond set up a free travel insurance scheme. </p> <p>National childcare organisations and the children and families committee of the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS) responded with a mix of scepticism and, you guessed it, incredulity. But advice and support were readily on offer, especially from Gene Hill, on behalf of the ADSS. As a result, six pilot trips were staged, which quickly convinced all concerned of the huge benefits to be gained by participants. </p> <p>When most of us think about getting away, we take it for granted that we're able to have a break, see new sights, travel with friends or family and take time out to rest, to become ourselves again. </p> <p>For children who have been taken into local authority care because of family illness, abuse, psychiatric or behavioural difficulties at home, a holiday is not something they take for granted. In fact, there is no national standard of holiday provision for children in care homes. </p> <p>On Time2Care pilot trips, I've seen young people from Leicester, Croydon and Northumberland touching and tasting the Mediterranean for the first time - in fact, one young person asked when the sea shut. They've been caravanning, had an activity holiday, stayed in a hotel and visited a theme park in France, just like everyone else. </p> <p>After one pilot trip, a young person asked about how to train to become a kiddies' rep, while the whole group returned from Ibiza to school last September, proud to tell their schoolmates that they'd had a holiday abroad. </p> <p>The social workers involved in the pilot trips see Time2Care as an opportunity to enhance their working relationships with the young people in their care. Others see it as a chance to assess their behaviour in a new and stimulating environment. And the Department of Health is assessing how a Time2Care holiday can contribute to promoting the health and educational objectives of children's services. </p> <p>The public has responded to national press coverage about Time2Care in the most heart-warming ways. Private holiday homes, cottages and villas around the UK and Europe have been offered, so that social workers can take breaks with children who need a short quiet break at the last minute. </p> <p>I got a call from a social worker in Northumberland recently, asking for a weekend caravanning break for a 13 year old and two social workers - the circumstances were pretty bad, but a few hours later they had a free luxury caravan for the weekend, with free passes to the activity park thrown in.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We were travelling in a rickety Brazilian bus on the way from Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, in the north of the Amazon basin, to the Venezuelan frontier. Through the dust-covered window, we caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a small field of soya beans, Brazil's main export crop. \"Yes, that's what it is,\" said a fellow passenger. \"They're telling us it's going to be the wonder crop for our state. I might try it next year.\" </p> <p>The process of change the Portuguese initiated is gathering momentum for a final, definitive assault on the Amazon basin. The globalised market is reaching one of its final outposts. Agribusiness is replacing the subsistence agriculture practised by Indians and peasant families, and monoculture is taking the place of diversity. </p> <p>This process is supported by the Brazilian authorities. Three years ago, when he was in Manaus to open the Madeira-Amazon waterway, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said: \"This project will produce a new cycle of development for the region. From now on, Amazonia has to develop its agriculture and send its crops all over the world.\" </p> <p>The crop that is spearheading the new development is soya beans. Over the past five years, soya farmers have moved, quietly but very rapidly, into the Amazon basin from the south.

      "bodyText": "We were travelling in a rickety Brazilian bus on the way from Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima, in the north of the Amazon basin, to the Venezuelan frontier. Through the dust-covered window, we caught a glimpse of what appeared to be a small field of soya beans, Brazil's main export crop. \"Yes, that's what it is,\" said a fellow passenger. \"They're telling us it's going to be the wonder crop for our state. I might try it next year.\" The process of change the Portuguese initiated is gathering momentum for a final, definitive assault on the Amazon basin. The globalised market is reaching one of its final outposts. Agribusiness is replacing the subsistence agriculture practised by Indians and peasant families, and monoculture is taking the place of diversity. This process is supported by the Brazilian authorities. Three years ago, when he was in Manaus to open the Madeira-Amazon waterway, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said: \"This project will produce a new cycle of development for the region. From now on, Amazonia has to develop its agriculture and send its crops all over the world.\" The crop that is spearheading the new development is soya beans. Over the past five years, soya farmers have moved, quietly but very rapidly, into the Amazon basin from the south. These farmers have already devastated much of the savannah and transitional rainforest of Mato Grosso. At the front of the soya invasion is a tiny elite of extremely powerful Brazilian farmers, closely allied with local politicians. Their leader is 72-year-old Andre Maggi, the largest soya farmer in the world.

Patient groups are ready to damn Nice to perdition if they are not allowed the medicines they want on the NHS, while health authorities are consumed with worry about the possible consequences to their budgets. And don't imagine that the government is watching with equanimity. </p> <p>At the heart of it, preparing to defend Nice to the hilt and deflect flak from the clinicians who must take the decisions, is Andrew Dillon, the chief executive. Some might think his job unenviable. He says it's great. </p> <p>\"There's huge enthusiasm here for what we're doing because it is something really important for the NHS,\" he says. \"There's nobody who works here who doesn't come into it with their eyes open. All of the pressures, all of the influences on the process, are evident. </p> <p>\"The good thing about what we're doing is that we don't pretend the pressure is not there. And we're as clear as we honestly can be, based on our experience so far, as to how we're going to handle it to produce something that does have integrity, that does have value for the NHS.\" </p> <p>He believes in transparency and openness. Cynics might say that is the only way to survive as piggy-in-the-middle between powerful vested interests such as the government and the pharmaceutical industry. </p> <p>But Dillon is convinced that the appraisal committee - the high-powered group of scientists who must make a cost-effectiveness judgment on controversial new medicines and technologies - will not be swayed. They will make their decisions on the evidence, he says repeatedly, and will defuse the critics by being open about the way they came to their verdict. </p> <p>\"The one thing we've got to show is that we're consistent in the way we approach the analysis of the evidence and that we can show an audit trail that takes you from the evidence that we considered through to the decision that goes out,\" he insists. \"We've got to be able to show how it's possible and appropriate to get from the evidence to the decision. And then we have to explain it.\" </p> <p>But Nice's remit is not only clinical effectiveness, but cost effectiveness. So will it not be nothing more than a rationing mechanism? What about those hints in the early days from Sir Michael Rawlings, the chair, that Nice would have to live in the real world and cut its cloth according to NHS budgets? Will Nice take into account the amount of money the government is willing to spend on a new drug when it makes its decisions? </p> <p>Dillon says the views of the Department of Health and of the national assembly for Wales must be taken into account during the consultation process - but only in the same way as the views of any other interested party. </p> <p>\"Half way through the process, we've got a draft of the appraisal and we send that out to patient groups and manufacturers and the department of health,\" Dillon explains. \"So the department has, entirely appropriately, an opportunity to influence - just as everybody else does - the nature of the appraisal that comes out.\" </p> <p>He denies that ministers' views might weigh more heavily than others - but the reality is that the department holds the purse strings. </p> <p>So far, the government has not indicated that it has any spending limits in respect of the first 20 appraisals it has requested of Nice, says Dillon, but he accepts that it may happen. </p> <p>\"I don't know whether the department would, in any particular circumstances, be so specific as to say that there's a fixed amount - a net total increase - for this particular technology, but any of us can envisage circumstances in which they might, because no healthcare system can write a blank cheque,\" he admits. \"They would know in the consultation process what it's likely to cost. The department would then be in a position to make an assumption about the impact that's going to have on their responsibility to make sure that all services are available to patients.\" </p> <p>He could see the government asking whether a new drug might be restricted to the group of patients it would most benefit - which is what Frank Dobson unilaterally decided to do with Viagra. Or perhaps the government, he ponders optimistically, might consider making more money available. </p> <p>The fact is, he acknowledges, that he is thinking on his feet about the way the process will work \"because we don't really have any experience of it at all\". </p> <p>The sticky moments have not yet arrived. The crunch decisions have yet to be made. But it becomes clear in conversation that the absolute objectivity, the demonstrable scientific logic of the process that Dillon likes to emphasise are not the end of the story. </p> <p>\"The appraisal committee will be aware of the department's view, which, in an individual case, might be a view on the ability of the health service to afford what seems to be the emerging guidance,\" he says. \"The committee members have got that information in front of them. So that view is one of a whole series of influences on the committee's thinking. The point of having the appraisal committee - this group of 24 people - is to enable the inevitably very human judgment to be made about how particular technology should be applied.\" </p> <p> And so we have the human factor. Ministers will not be the only source of pressure. Other forceful influences will be brought to bear on the committee from patients who may be dying or hope for a better quality of life in the short time they have left. A new drug may offer them an extra year - at a huge cost to the NHS. But what price a year of life? It isn't difficult to anticipate the headlines. </p> <p>\"The committee members are human beings like you and me and like the editors of newspapers and have exactly the same thoughts about precisely that issue,\" Dillon says. \"What they can do is combine that very human thinking and very human sensitivity to what it actually means to get this clinical benefit - they can add to that from their very specific skills and experience. </p> <p>\"So they can arrive at a judgment that can be seen to be informed by the evidence of clinical trials, but turned into advice for the institute by people who can themselves make the judgments human beings can make about benefit. And that simply can't be made on the basis of numbers crunched by a machine.\" </p> <p>Whether that will wear with the patient groups if their drug is refused Nice's blessing for supply on the NHS is another matter, but Dillon is hopeful. </p> <p>\"By deliberately and genuinely trying to be open and inclusive, I think we've got to the point where patient groups are prepared to give us a go,\" he says. \"They are sufficiently persuaded of the way we are doing things to take part in it. They haven't rejected the whole concept of Nice.\" </p> <p>Not yet. But Nice has not yet pronounced on those controversial medicines for cancer, for multiple sclerosis, for Alzheimer's - and there will be many more such in years to come. Nice will surely win respect if it proceeds as Dillon expects - but winning friends is another matter altogether.</p>",

Will Nice take into account the amount of money the government is willing to spend on a new drug when it makes its decisions? Dillon says the views of the Department of Health and of the national assembly for Wales must be taken into account during the consultation process - but only in the same way as the views of any other interested party. \"Half way through the process, we've got a draft of the appraisal and we send that out to patient groups and manufacturers and the department of health,\" Dillon explains. \"So the department has, entirely appropriately, an opportunity to influence - just as everybody else does - the nature of the appraisal that comes out.\" He denies that ministers' views might weigh more heavily than others - but the reality is that the department holds the purse strings. So far, the government has not indicated that it has any spending limits in respect of the first 20 appraisals it has requested of Nice, says Dillon, but he accepts that it may happen. \"I don't know whether the department would, in any particular circumstances, be so specific as to say that there's a fixed amount - a net total increase - for this particular technology, but any of us can envisage circumstances in which they might, because no healthcare system can write a blank cheque,\" he admits. \"They would know in the consultation process what it's likely to cost. The department would then be in a position to make an assumption about the impact that's going to have on their responsibility to make sure that all services are available to patients.\" He could see the government asking whether a new drug might be restricted to the group of patients it would most benefit - which is what Frank Dobson unilaterally decided to do with Viagra. Or perhaps the government, he ponders optimistically, might consider making more money available. The fact is, he acknowledges, that he is thinking on his feet about the way the process will work \"because we don't really have any experience of it at all\". The sticky moments have not yet arrived. The crunch decisions have yet to be made. But it becomes clear in conversation that the absolute objectivity, the demonstrable scientific logic of the process that Dillon likes to emphasise are not the end of the story. \"The appraisal committee will be aware of the department's view, which, in an individual case, might be a view on the ability of the health service to afford what seems to be the emerging guidance,\" he says. \"The committee members have got that information in front of them. So that view is one of a whole series of influences on the committee's thinking. The point of having the appraisal committee - this group of 24 people - is to enable the inevitably very human judgment to be made about how particular technology should be applied.\" And so we have the human factor. Ministers will not be the only source of pressure. Other forceful influences will be brought to bear on the committee from patients who may be dying or hope for a better quality of life in the short time they have left. A new drug may offer them an extra year - at a huge cost to the NHS. But what price a year of life? It isn't difficult to anticipate the headlines. \"The committee members are human beings like you and me and like the editors of newspapers and have exactly the same thoughts about precisely that issue,\" Dillon says. \"What they can do is combine that very human thinking and very human sensitivity to what it actually means to get this clinical benefit - they can add to that from their very specific skills and experience. \"So they can arrive at a judgment that can be seen to be informed by the evidence of clinical trials, but turned into advice for the institute by people who can themselves make the judgments human beings can make about benefit. And that simply can't be made on the basis of numbers crunched by a machine.\" Whether that will wear with the patient groups if their drug is refused Nice's blessing for supply on the NHS is another matter, but Dillon is hopeful. \"By deliberately and genuinely trying to be open and inclusive, I think we've got to the point where patient groups are prepared to give us a go,\" he says. \"They are sufficiently persuaded of the way we are doing things to take part in it. They haven't rejected the whole concept of Nice.\" Not yet. But Nice has not yet pronounced on those controversial medicines for cancer, for multiple sclerosis, for Alzheimer's - and there will be many more such in years to come. Nice will surely win respect if it proceeds as Dillon expects - but winning friends is another matter altogether.",

Mrs Overfield said: \"His wish was that if he died we should donate his organs for transplant to give someone else a chance of life. He was such a generous, giving boy, so we allowed the transplant of his organs.\" He had been in trouble at school and had been placed on report. The coroner, David Hinchliff, was told that Daniel disliked art. As well as the comment on his attention span, his report card had two crosses which counted towards detention, although Daniel's headteacher had told him not to worry about them. After Mrs Overfield found Daniel hanging, ambulance crews resuscitated him, but he died in Leeds general infirmary four days later having suffered irreversible brain damage. Mr Hinchliff said the criticism and the possibility of a detention could have been preying on Daniel's mind, but he could not believe he had deliberately tried to kill himself. \"It might have been to draw attention to himself.\" He recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said teachers faced a dilemma in judging their comments to children. The teacher in this case \"had no remote conception that he might have been writing out a death sentence\".",

Tory strategists believe that on past form, their plans to lock up all immigrants in army barracks for six weeks will deliver an electoral revival. But the Tories have claimed victory by default on asylum. They have only won in the past because progressive opinion has opted out of the debate. The kneejerk reaction amongst liberals has been to condemn inflammatory language without answering the vexed question of how we deal with the huge increase in asylum applications. Now, the left is finally realising that it needs persuasive policies to counter the prison-camp rhetoric.</p> <p>Immigration is always emotive and has real resonance in Labour's heartlands. But however much people complain about it, it isn't one of the bread-and-butter issues that will decide the Blair government's fate. Monthly polls organised by Mori show that only 4% of voters think it is the most important political issue. With political leadership, it should be possible to win on this issue, but Labour urgently needs a clear intellectual case. First, they must resist the kneejerk reaction against foreigners. The current climate treats all newcomers - economic migrant or asylum seeker, bogus or legitimate - as a problem. A new breed of politicians never tire of celebrating multicultural Britain, yet in the same breath, they refer to new refugees as a \"burden\".</p> <p>This confusion - mixing up asylum and immigration and failing to develop a coherent approach to either - doesn't just betray our human rights and our history of global links. It fails to see that getting immigration right is vital to our success in the global knowledge economy.</p> <p>On asylum, the xenophobic right must be prevented from hijacking our history. Our long tradition of providing refuge for the persecuted is often conveniently airbrushed out. Britain's protection of Huguenots persecuted by Louise XIV should be invoked by speech writers as often as the Battle of Britain. The Conservatives' attacks on asylum seekers can be easily resisted by glancing at the biographies of the upper echelons of the party. It's not just that Michael Portillo would not be in Britain today if Anne Widdecombe's policies had been adopted in the 1930s - Nigel Lawson, Leon Brittan and Keith Joseph would never have made it either.</p> <p>Support for accepting genuine asylum seekers is undermined by a shambolic system which takes 13 months to process an average claim. Last year, Britain had 53% more asylum applications than in 1998 and now receives more than Germany. Numbers have increased tenfold in a decade - from 4,000 in 1989 to 46,000 in 1998 - not because Britain is a \"soft touch\" but because of the fallout at the end of the cold war. Britain has to fulfil its obligations under international treaties, but there is clearly a limit to the number that can be absorbed. The government should make a clear commitment every three years on the maximum number of asylum seekers - in the absence of a major catastrophe that might require negotiation. As the prime minister argues: \"unless reasonable and tolerant people\" deal with abuses in the system, the unreasonable and intolerant will seize control.</p> <p>On immigration, we need to be guided by hardheaded economic analysis rather than the mental hangover of an ethnic colour bar. It is ironic that the tabloid furore has reached fever pitch at the same time that forecasters are calling for an increase in skilled immigrant labour. Economists and demographers are predicting a fiercely competitive international market for the best-educated migrants. Europe will struggle to support its pensioners as life spans stretch and birth rates slow. A dwindling band of young workers will have to pay for the pensions and healthcare of their parents and grandparents. Countries may be forced to offer cash incentives to import young wealth creators from Asia and the third world.</p> <p>Immigrants have a proven track record of creating wealth wherever they go - and it isn't all down to hard work. Global markets have a constant thirst for new ideas, new products, new recipes, new ways of doing things. Immigrants shake up vested interests, take on bloated corporations and bring about new working practices.</p> <p>But our negative stereotypes of immigrants stop us harnessing their potential. The tabloid assumption that they sign on the dole within hours of touchdown is replicated by official structures. Asylum seekers are not allowed to enter the employment market while their case is being investigated and the only advice they receive is how to access the social security network. Yet hard working migrants in search of a better life haven't come here to live on a sink estate on \u00a340 a week. Gordon Brown could think about a new deal for immigrants with language training, work experience and advice on setting up a business.</p> <p>The chancellor claims that 1m jobs are left vacant in the UK. But there has been no systematic attempt to identify where the skill shortages lie. The Department of Trade and Industry could also carry out a national skills audit to find out whom we need and where we need them.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to asylum seekers, the right have always had the best tunes. The send 'em all home brigade in Smith Square are again drafting draconian policies to woo middle England. Tory strategists believe that on past form, their plans to lock up all immigrants in army barracks for six weeks will deliver an electoral revival. But the Tories have claimed victory by default on asylum. They have only won in the past because progressive opinion has opted out of the debate. The kneejerk reaction amongst liberals has been to condemn inflammatory language without answering the vexed question of how we deal with the huge increase in asylum applications. Now, the left is finally realising that it needs persuasive policies to counter the prison-camp rhetoric. Immigration is always emotive and has real resonance in Labour's heartlands. But however much people complain about it, it isn't one of the bread-and-butter issues that will decide the Blair government's fate. Monthly polls organised by Mori show that only 4% of voters think it is the most important political issue. With political leadership, it should be possible to win on this issue, but Labour urgently needs a clear intellectual case. First, they must resist the kneejerk reaction against foreigners. The current climate treats all newcomers - economic migrant or asylum seeker, bogus or legitimate - as a problem. A new breed of politicians never tire of celebrating multicultural Britain, yet in the same breath, they refer to new refugees as a \"burden\". This confusion - mixing up asylum and immigration and failing to develop a coherent approach to either - doesn't just betray our human rights and our history of global links. It fails to see that getting immigration right is vital to our success in the global knowledge economy. On asylum, the xenophobic right must be prevented from hijacking our history. Our long tradition of providing refuge for the persecuted is often conveniently airbrushed out. Britain's protection of Huguenots persecuted by Louise XIV should be invoked by speech writers as often as the Battle of Britain. The Conservatives' attacks on asylum seekers can be easily resisted by glancing at the biographies of the upper echelons of the party. It's not just that Michael Portillo would not be in Britain today if Anne Widdecombe's policies had been adopted in the 1930s - Nigel Lawson, Leon Brittan and Keith Joseph would never have made it either. Support for accepting genuine asylum seekers is undermined by a shambolic system which takes 13 months to process an average claim. Last year, Britain had 53% more asylum applications than in 1998 and now receives more than Germany. Numbers have increased tenfold in a decade - from 4,000 in 1989 to 46,000 in 1998 - not because Britain is a \"soft touch\" but because of the fallout at the end of the cold war. Britain has to fulfil its obligations under international treaties, but there is clearly a limit to the number that can be absorbed. The government should make a clear commitment every three years on the maximum number of asylum seekers - in the absence of a major catastrophe that might require negotiation. As the prime minister argues: \"unless reasonable and tolerant people\" deal with abuses in the system, the unreasonable and intolerant will seize control. On immigration, we need to be guided by hardheaded economic analysis rather than the mental hangover of an ethnic colour bar. It is ironic that the tabloid furore has reached fever pitch at the same time that forecasters are calling for an increase in skilled immigrant labour. Economists and demographers are predicting a fiercely competitive international market for the best-educated migrants. Europe will struggle to support its pensioners as life spans stretch and birth rates slow. A dwindling band of young workers will have to pay for the pensions and healthcare of their parents and grandparents. Countries may be forced to offer cash incentives to import young wealth creators from Asia and the third world. Immigrants have a proven track record of creating wealth wherever they go - and it isn't all down to hard work. Global markets have a constant thirst for new ideas, new products, new recipes, new ways of doing things. Immigrants shake up vested interests, take on bloated corporations and bring about new working practices. But our negative stereotypes of immigrants stop us harnessing their potential. The tabloid assumption that they sign on the dole within hours of touchdown is replicated by official structures. Asylum seekers are not allowed to enter the employment market while their case is being investigated and the only advice they receive is how to access the social security network. Yet hard working migrants in search of a better life haven't come here to live on a sink estate on \u00a340 a week. Gordon Brown could think about a new deal for immigrants with language training, work experience and advice on setting up a business. The chancellor claims that 1m jobs are left vacant in the UK. But there has been no systematic attempt to identify where the skill shortages lie. The Department of Trade and Industry could also carry out a national skills audit to find out whom we need and where we need them. We should allow into the country a limited number of economic migrants based on proof of their skills. Canada has created a points system that scores would-be migrants according to their skills and qualifications. Every year 100,000 asylum seekers disappear from the radar screen during the protracted claims process. Most are working as cleaners, waiters and security guards. I have come across mini-cab drivers who are trained engineers, psychiatrists working as builders. We need a route to guide them back into the formal, taxed economy. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has suggested that immigrants could be guaranteed citizenship if they were willing to use their qualifications.

Labour won't win if it tries to out-Widdecombe the Tories. But it can show that the Tories' attempts to wrap themselves in the flag betray this country's history and store up economic problems for the future.

      "bodyText": "The biggest mass trial so far of suspected former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army began in the southern Serbian city of Nis yesterday. Traffic was halted in the city as the 145 Albanian defendants, who are charged with terrorist activities, were driven in three buses to the heavily guarded court. The Albanians, from the Kosovan town of Djakovica, are accused of \"organising and participating in terrorist and enemy activities\" - including the killing of police officers - against Serbian security forces stationed in Kosovo last year. The use of the words \"terrorist activities\" in the indictment indicates that the authorities consider the defendants - mainly young men - to be former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has since been officially disbanded. Yesterday's proceedings were dominated by the taking of personal details from all 145 defendants: a task defence lawyers said would normally be carried out before the trial. Proceedings are expected to start in earnest today, with verdicts likely later this week. The defendants were arrested in Djakovica, near the Albanian border, during Nato air strikes a year ago. They were among hundreds of Albanian prisoners held by the Serbian authorities in Kosovo until Belgrade ceded control of the province to Nato last June. When the Yugoslav army and Serb police withdraw from Kosovo, they took with them more than 2,000 prisoners, mainly Kosovo Albanians charged with terrorism, and moved them to jails elsewhere in Serbia. A number of prominent Albanians, including the paediatrician and women's activist Flora Brovina, and the student leader Albin Kurti have already been convicted of terrorism and sentenced to long prison terms at trials which drew criticism both locally and abroad. The UN mission in Kosovo estimates that about 1,500 Kosovo Albanians remain in Serbian jails. International officials have called for them to be returned to Kosovo. More than 20 lawyers are taking part in the defence of this latest group of Albanians, whose trial is being monitored by human rights activists. The lawyers say that the defendants were held from May to December without being informed of the reasons for their detention. \"This is a political trial through which the Belgrade regime is attempting to cover up the great tragedy it has provoked in Kosovo,\" said Natasa Kandic of the Humanitarian Law Centre in Belgrade. \"These Albanians are innocent civilians who were not involved in armed actions and who were kidnapped on the streets of Djakovica.\" The trial comes as Belgrade pursues a creeping clampdown on its opponents in politics and the media. The campaign is likely to be stepped up following an opposition protest rally last Friday for which more than 100,000 people turned out to demand an end to the regime of President Slobodan Milosevic. The authorities are making full use of the malleable Serbian legal system to try to neutralise voices of dissent. Opposition activists, former police officers and newspaper editors have all been brought to trial. The criminal charges are intended to discredit opposition politicians, while heavy fines imposed on newspapers and broadcasters threaten to cripple financially the non-government press. The control of public opinion in Serbia is vital, since local elections are due to be held by the end of the year. The authorities have used telecommunications legislation to seize the equipment of a number of radio and television stations, and they are jamming the signal of the influential Studio B television channel in Belgrade, which is controlled by the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic. Analysts in Belgrade suspect that President Milosevic may try to offer enticements to either Mr Draskovic or another opposition figure to break the newly established but fragile unity of the Serbian opposition.",

The government's restrictions would force Mr Livingstone to resign his directorship of Localaction, the company which receives his earnings from media work and after-dinner speaking. Mr Livingstone was forced to apologise to the Commons last month for failing to disclose \u00a3158,000 worth of income from his media engagements. Parliamentary guidelines permit MPs to hold company directorships, provided they are logged in the register of members' interests. But the tougher rules for the London mayor reflects No 10's desire to keep Mr Livingstone on a short leash if, as opinion polls suggest, the former Labour MP is elected on May 4. Meanwhile, Mr Livingstone continued his move away from the Labour party today by urging his supporters to back the Green party in the \"top-up\" section of the mayoral vote. Mr Livingstone sees the Greens as potential partners for his independent mayoralty, which is likely to face criticism from the probable Labour majority in the assembly. He praised the Greens' \"cooperative\" attitude, and said: \"London's environmental pollution shortens the life of every Londoner. A strong Green contingent in the assembly is vital to clean up London.\" Mr Livingstone recommended that people vote for Labour in the constituency section of the elections \"because almost all of these contests are straight fights between Labour and the Tories\". His suggestion that his supporters should give their second choice votes to Frank Dobson, Labour's official candidate, is based on the calculation that the Tories' Steven Norris and the Liberal Democrats' Susan Kramer may pose a greater threat in the second round of the ballot. If no candidate wins 50% of the vote, the second-choice votes of the losing candidates are distributed between the top two to calculate the overall winner.",

      "bodyText": "For Martin Olds it was a chilling wake up call. At around 6am yesterday more than 100 squatters gathered at the white farmer's gate in Nyamandlovu, about 50 miles from Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city. They had come in a convoy of 14 cars and a tractor trailer, many of them carrying hunting weapons. By 6.15am Olds, 42, was radioing the Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents white farmers, in a state of panic. \"They're cutting through my fence,\" he said and warned the CFU that it looked as though the situation might turn ugly. Within minutes it was out of control. The protesters had broken down his gate and were at his door. The homestead, which Olds had named Compensation, was surrounded. The next time he called the CFU his message was short. \"I've been shot, call an ambulance.\" His appeal sent the airwaves crackling as the local white community got on their radios. Following the abduction and murder of the white farmer David Stevens in another part of the country, they had been worrying about where the protesters might strike next. Rumours had been circulating in Matabeleland - which includes the area surrounding Bulawayo - that war veterans had been armed with AK-47s. What is more, Olds knew he might be a target; he had already been threatened at least once. According to one local couple, last month he took \"trespassers\" on his land to the police station and had them arrested after a court ruled that the land occupations were illegal. The squatters warned him they would get even. No sooner had the word gone out that one of their number was in trouble than white farmers in the area climbed into their pickup trucks and raced to Old's cattle farm to offer their assistance. One flew his private plane over the house to see what was happening. But whenever they got close to the homestead they were shot at by the veterans who also, say the farmers, opened fire on an ambulance. Back at the house Olds was engaged in a shootout with the squatters which some locals say lasted for three hours. A spokesman for Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF, which has supported the squatters, said that Olds had fired at the veterans, hitting five of them with pellets, and it was only then that they shot back. Farmers insist that Olds, a father of two, was simply defending his house by the same means that the squatters were trying to take it - through the barrel of a gun. The police arrived at the scene while the gunfight was in full throttle but did not stop it. The stand-off ended when squatters threw molotov cocktails into the house. Olds's home started to burn and when the heat became too intense inside he stumbled out into the hands of the veterans. They beat him severely and then shot him twice in the face at close range. \"They killed my son,\" said Gloria Olds, Martin's mother. \"They beat him to a pulp.\" Compensation crumbled to a cinder - a smouldering backdrop to its owner's corpse - and the squatters left as they had come: slowly, in a long, snaking convoy edging back towards Bulawayo. No attempt was made to occupy the land they had just taken. Instead, they exchanged a few, casual words with the police as they left. The police here, say locals, are simply coathangers for uniforms. They did not make any arrests. White farmers in the area still do not know quite how to react. They have accused the government of arming the protesters and claim it proves that the occupations are acts of political intimidation, prompted by Robert Mugabe's government, rather than a misguided policy to help the landless. \"If land invasions were demonstrations for land, why are people being given weapons?\" asked Mac Crawford, the chairman of the Matabeleland CFU. \"This is a deliberate ploy to escalate violence.\" Crawford believes that the police's inaction makes them complicit in the occupations but he can provide no proof beyond anecdotal evidence. The home affairs minister, Dumiso Dabengwa, denied knowledge of anyone supplying arms to protesters. He agreed that the state of law and order in Zimbabwe left much to be desired but insisted that the police were doing all they could to stop the violence. White farmers are not convinced. Despite the fact that they are hopelessly outnumbered and have little political clout, they have started issuing scarcely-veiled threats that they are ready to fight back. \"The farmers are now on alert and standing by,\" Mr Crawford said, adding that his members were taking \"necessary security measures\". But on the ground, there is a mixture of bewilderment, frustration and despair rather than defiance. Farmers in the area have decided to move women and children out immediately and are holding a meeting tomorrow to decide whether to remain or evacuate the area altogether, as happened in the Macheke area after David Stevens was killed at the weekend. \"This thing will escalate until somebody takes a stand to stop it,\" says Chris Jarrett, who has a farm nearby. \"What precautions can you take when 150 men break onto your land and burn down your house?\" asked Harry Greaves who lives on the farm next to Compensation. \"Especially if the police will not protect you.\"",

And numerous Mr Browns are sweating, some in the Caribbean and some in South Asia. Coloured, in the new cricketing vernacular, is what insiders call a scripted game, and colour is a vital component of this crisis. </p> <p>The Asian view of Cronjegate is simple: shock and relief, in equal measure. Shock, because it now seems that the most conclusive evidence in cricket history is in the possession of the Indian police. Up to now, all the Asian scandals and inquiries have lacked one crucial element: proof. Shock, because all those lingering accusations are suddenly given immense weight. And, shock that a white cricketer, and one of Cronje\u00b9s stature, has been exposed.</p> <p>But therein lies the relief. Match-fixing had become an Asian disease; as if it was something Asians did, and the rest of the world should pity us for. The three Asian judicial inquiries might have been flawed, but they did provide enough information for a half-alert ICC to seize on. Shame, that never happened. Shame, too, that match-fixing remained an apparently Asian trait even though Shane Warne and Mark Waugh took money from bookies. Their transgression was labelled trifling. Did Cronje really do any worse? In this game of half-truths and partial confessions we may never know. But, certainly, Warne and Waugh are extremely fortunate that their board hushed up the affair with ICC\u00b9s blessing, and that there are no taped conversations implicating them in something more serious.</p> <p>Cronje\u00b9s plight highlights the double standards in international cricket. Accuse an Asian cricketer of match-fixing and the reaction is that it is probably true; it is barely considered newsworthy. Accuse South Africa\u00b9s captain of the same, and the blanket response is moral outrage; a plan cooked up by those awful brownies to deflect attention from their own corruption and abysmal form. Cronje is a religious man after all. But, as any South Asian will tell you, probably from personal experience, devout believers are capable of the most outrageous acts, and financial impropriety is one of them.</p> <p>Once Cronje had confessed, his whiter-than-white front was shattered. I can understand the shock in South Africa. Partly because Asians have felt the same when our best players have been implicated, and partly because I have had an insight into the way Cronje was revered. It was after South Africa defeated Pakistan at Trent Bridge in last year\u00b9s World Cup. At the post-match press conference, the South African media were embarrassing. It was clear that they worshipped Cronje and were in complete awe of their golden boy. They fawned over him, laughed at his dull jokes, and asked him the most ingratiating questions. No wonder, then, that they cannot believe his fall.</p> <p>But it isn\u00b9t just the South African media that has revealed its prejudicial view of justice. Australians and Englishmen have done the same, from broadsheets to tabloids to the internet. For example, Michael Henderson, who occupies the key position of cricket correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, concluded that England should stop playing India and Pakistan, as well as spurning any invitations to play at Sharjah. Excuse me, but where does Cronje come from? And what about Warne and Waugh? Or am I getting it wrong, and it is one rule for the white nations and another for the rest?</p> <p>Indeed, it has to be the same rule for all, and the only way of ensuring that is for ICC to fulfil its mandate rather than remaining a pale imitation of an ineffectual branch of the UN. It should begin by poring over the findings of the Australian, Indian, and Pakistani inquiries. The Australians remain defensive and protective of their stars. The Indians, basking in their success over Cronje, are reopening the book on past indiscretions. While the Pakistanis are keeping suspiciously quiet. Judge Qayyum\u00b9s report remains officially undisclosed, but its findings have been so widely leaked that the Pakistani authorities are simply making it look more like a cover-up with each passing day.</p> <p>Echoes of the past are coming back to haunt us: the divide between Asia and the old cricketing powers; the legacy of bungled inquiries; and the impotence of ICC. One more lesson must be learned and that is about the treatment of whistleblowers. Manoj Prabakhar, Rashid Latif, and Amir Sohail have all suffered for making a stand. They have been dismissed as troublemakers and has-beens. They may be both, but their accusations are more powerful by the day. Chris Lewis has now reluctantly joined that group. He may have an axe to grind too, but he doesn\u00b9t deserve a character assassination. Whistleblowers are generally treated like scoundrels and presumed to be liars. That is as foolish as believing all accusations.</p> <p>The enigma of match-fixing is correctly identifying the villains and the heroes. The waters are rapidly clearing. And the reflex judgement that white is good and brown is bad is now less sustainable than it ever was. For that, at least, thank you, Hansie.</p> <p><em>Kamran Abbasi, born in Lahore, brought up in Rotherham, is editor of the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation.

No wonder, then, that they cannot believe his fall. But it isn\u00b9t just the South African media that has revealed its prejudicial view of justice. Australians and Englishmen have done the same, from broadsheets to tabloids to the internet. For example, Michael Henderson, who occupies the key position of cricket correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, concluded that England should stop playing India and Pakistan, as well as spurning any invitations to play at Sharjah. Excuse me, but where does Cronje come from? And what about Warne and Waugh? Or am I getting it wrong, and it is one rule for the white nations and another for the rest? Indeed, it has to be the same rule for all, and the only way of ensuring that is for ICC to fulfil its mandate rather than remaining a pale imitation of an ineffectual branch of the UN. It should begin by poring over the findings of the Australian, Indian, and Pakistani inquiries. The Australians remain defensive and protective of their stars. The Indians, basking in their success over Cronje, are reopening the book on past indiscretions. While the Pakistanis are keeping suspiciously quiet. Judge Qayyum\u00b9s report remains officially undisclosed, but its findings have been so widely leaked that the Pakistani authorities are simply making it look more like a cover-up with each passing day. Echoes of the past are coming back to haunt us: the divide between Asia and the old cricketing powers; the legacy of bungled inquiries; and the impotence of ICC. One more lesson must be learned and that is about the treatment of whistleblowers. Manoj Prabakhar, Rashid Latif, and Amir Sohail have all suffered for making a stand. They have been dismissed as troublemakers and has-beens. They may be both, but their accusations are more powerful by the day. Chris Lewis has now reluctantly joined that group. He may have an axe to grind too, but he doesn\u00b9t deserve a character assassination. Whistleblowers are generally treated like scoundrels and presumed to be liars. That is as foolish as believing all accusations. The enigma of match-fixing is correctly identifying the villains and the heroes. The waters are rapidly clearing. And the reflex judgement that white is good and brown is bad is now less sustainable than it ever was. For that, at least, thank you, Hansie.

The draft now being sold by Christie's in Paris details how he reluctantly plumped for the latter. Having been rejected by pretty well every publisher in Paris, Proust printed the book himself, paying extra for his constant revisions. The chopped and changed manuscript on sale forms all but one page of Du Cote de Chez Swann (Swann's Way), the first volume of his magnum opus, which somehow became detached from the rest of the Proust papers after the death of his brother Robert in 1935.

Jacob's justified his underwhelming endorsement of the programme by arguing that two 'satisfactory' years in a row represented an improvement on Cannes' traditional good year/bad year pattern. 'This is something that hasn't happened in along time', he said. The Festival runs from 10-21 May. The main films in competition are: Joel Coen's musical O Brother, Where Art Thou?, with George Clooney and John Turturro, Lars Von Trier's musical Dancer in the Dark, starring Bjork, Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood for Love, and 20-year-old Iranian wunderkind Samira Makhmalbaf's second feature The Blackboard. This year's jury is headed by Luc Besson and includes Jonathan Demme, Kristin Scott Thomas and Jeremy Irons. The Festival opens with Roland Joffe's Vatel, starring Gerard Depardieu, and closes with Stardom, directed by Denys Arcand.",

      "bodyText": "Edited commentary from the government-owned Zimbabwe Herald newspaper South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki had sober words for those hoping for a fall-out between his country and Zimbabwe over the issue of the farm invasions. Questioned by journalists in Cuba this week, he instead urged dialogue, saying there is need for Zimbabwe and Britain to get together, back to the understanding reached when the independence of Zimbabwe was negotiated in 1979 and to solve the problem that way. He rightly noted that Britain and the US had at the time committed themselves to funding the purchase of white-owned land. President Mbeki's responses were to the obvious chagrin of those who misguidedly thought that Zimbabwe's powerful neighbour would bring pressure to bear on the government of Zimbabwe for the benefit of the status quo on land. The land problem, which Morgan Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change would rather contemptuously treat as a periphery issue, was the major stumbling block at the Lancaster House conference in London in 1979. It remains the stumbling block to peace and security in Zimbabwe. The constitutional agreement, signed on December 21 that year, placed restrictions on the first majority rule government's ability to redistribute land forcibly taken away from the blacks over some 90 years of colonial rule. Election or no election, the land needs to be redistributed, and fast too, to correct the imbalance and bring the majority of the indigenous people out of subsistence farming in the virtually barren communal areas. And these communal farmers are not where they are today through choice. In the very early days of colonialism in the late 1890s, the first \"reserves\" created for the blacks were deliberately on land so poor and hostile that the colonials themselves did not want it. And, for example, 38% of the black population of Matabeleland had been forced into such areas by 1898. By 1931 a handful of whites had some 50m acres of prime land while vast numbers of blacks were herded onto just 21m acres. This policy of keeping the black farmers poor and, therefore, subservient to the colonial masters, was to be carried further by successive colonial regimes, with the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 and the Land Tenure Act of 1969, in particular. In Havana last week, President Mugabe was emphatic about the government's determination to acquire land from the white farmers, who own up to 75% of the best farmland, for redistribution to the disadvantaged black population. He stressed that the government would not allow any resistance to this. But, as he has done previously, he also assured that no farmer would be left without land. As with past appeals long before the farm invasions by liberation war veterans, if the farmers want to have a secure future in this country they would be well advised to treat land redistribution not as \"robbery\" as they prefer to view it, but a virtual necessity. It is vitally important, for future peace and prosperity, that the farmers accept that a situation where they sit on vast acres of prime land - the result of colonial brutal actions on the blacks - is untenable. Zimbabwe's economy is agriculture-based and a major advantage of putting more people on productive land will be a rise in output, with the resultant benefits to the economy. The time should have long since passed when some of these farmers treat their farms as \"little Rhodesias\" where they, and only they, rule supreme, to the extent of disparaging anyone black, including the president and the government. The passing of the constitutional amendment on land returns the responsibility to Britain of paying for land acquired from white commercial farmers as agreed at Lancaster in 1979. The present distribution of land in this African country is untenable, with just a minute number of \"European\" farmers - up to 4,500 - owning upwards of 70% of the most fertile land. Rather than hoping to cling on to it by sponsoring a political party they imagine can stem the tide, the white community would be best advised to work with the government for a permanent distribution that will bring prosperity through the land to the greater majority, and not just the few as at present. It is foolish for any ethnic minority to throw all its eggs into one leaky basket by taking the extremist position of supporting to the hilt the opposition against a government, in a manner that absolutely has nothing to do with democracy.

      "bodyText": "William Hague's decision to toughen up the Tories' asylum policy was hailed by his supporters last night as a powerful example of his ability to respond to the concerns of ordinary folk. During a series of Keep the Pound rallies around Britain in recent months, the Tory leader is said to have been struck by the number of voters who have complained to him personally that the asylum crisis is the most pressing political issue facing Britain. \"We have pledged to listen to Britain and William's speech shows that we are doing just that,\" one senior Tory said. Labour sources said, however, that the Tory leadership was deluding itself if it believed that the few hundred people who turned up at Keep the Pound rallies represented a broad swath of public opinion. The rallies usually attract rightwing opponents of Europe who are even more determined to defend the pound than Mr Hague and are therefore likely to be deeply hostile to asylum seekers. Allowing xenophobes at Eurosceptic rallies to dictate party policy provides another strong example of Mr Hague's lurch to the right, ministers believe. The think this shows that the Tories have abandoned the political centre ground, where elections are won. Mr Hague attempted to qualify the shrill tone of his speech by insisting that he remained committed to the British tradition of providing a safe haven for people genuinely fleeing persecution. However, his central message showed how the Tories show no signs of resembling an alternative government for two broad reasons. Mr Hague's harsh language yesterday, in a speech that was leaked to the rightwing Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and Sun, show that the Tory leadership is still only able to address its own constituency. Tories hope that his pledge to detain all asylum seekers will prove to be a vote winner in next month's local elections, and in next year's general election. However, Mr Hague appears not have learned the harsh lesson absorbed by Labour in the 1980s that a party which only addresses its core supporters will be repeatedly rejected by the voters. Central Office makes great play of its attempts to reach out beyond its traditional white, middle class support base. These efforts are likely now to be in tatters. Mr Hague seems to have ignored another lesson which Labour eventually learnt in the 1980s: never outline a major shift in policy without subjecting it to a rigorous assessment of the costs. Mr Hague's calculation that his plan would eventually save taxpayers \u00a3600m appears to be back of the envelope stuff, which was challenged by the Home Office yesterday. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, who has condemned both the Labour party and the Conservatives for their use of inflammatory language, summed up the charge against Mr Hague. \"I guess that the Hague speech is much less about the interests of refugees, asylum seekers or the British electorate than the interests of the Tory party,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's new asylum plans are based on the German system for asylum seekers but with a more optimistic timescale - six weeks - for resolving claims than even Berlin's bureaucratic efficiency can achieve. Initial calculations - supported by Home Office estimates -show that Mr Hague's plan to house all new asylum seekers in secure detention centres while their applications are being resolved would double the \u00a3857m annual cost of Britain's asylum system. Conservative Party spokesmen yesterday suggested that only \"five or six reception centres holding between 300 to 400\" would be needed. But this would only create places for 2,400 asylum seekers. Applications are running at 6,000 to 7,000 a month. Many cover families so the number of people applying for asylum each month probably exceeds 10,000. The Conservatives say they intend to cut the time it takes to resolve a claim from the current average of 13 months to six weeks. If, and it is a very big if, they achieved this target they would need a minimum of 9,000 places for applicants, although that excludes women and children who apply as part of families, in a network of more than 20 detention centres with about 400 places each. The newly opened processing centre at Oakington, near Cambridge, has 400 places and cost \u00a34m to convert from former army barracks. The running costs amount to \u00a3527 a week for each place or nearly \u00a311m a year. But there is not an inexhaustible supply of former army barracks around the country waiting to be converted into asylum detention centres. The prison service has spent three years scouring the country for possible sites for such centres. The Oakington camp only became available after a 2 year planning battle, and the service has exhausted possibilities of using other sites. The service has had to turn to prison ships to bridge the gap. These \"floatels\" could be an option for the Conservatives - they are used in Hamburg - but are regarded as only a short-term solution. So the Tories would have to build most of the extra detention centres needed at a cost of \u00a340m each, according to Home Office figures. The total bill could easily top \u00a3900 million which would double the cost of the current system. Mr Hague says he would make savings in the annual \u00a3600m cost in vouchers and accommodation by cutting the average waiting time to six weeks. But most commentators are highly sceptical of Labour's promise to cut the current wait of 13 months to six months by next April. When the shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe was immigration minister in the last government, the average wait was 23 months. Labour has employed 400 extra case workers at the asylum division of the Home Office in Croydon in an attempt to achieve its target. They are making decisions at the rate of 10,000 a month. To get the wait down from 13 months to six weeks would require hundreds more staff.",

      "body": "<p>In my grandfather's 1920 wedding photograph, he stands awkwardly, looking something of an impostor in an all too obviously rented topper and tails. That photo was taken in London several years after he successfully wormed his way (as some might put it these days) into Britain. Fetching the picture out now, I think: \"Were you a bogus asylum seeker, grandpa?\"</p> <p>It is a dismaying question to find running through the mind, because I had always previously felt quite straightforwardly towards those in authority who had let my grandfather, Abraham Levack, in off the dockside. My longstanding emotion can be summed up very simply. Thank you, England.</p> <p>Now the airwaves are heavy with the most malevolent descriptions of asylum seekers and their dirty ways. \"Flooding\" is the word I'm sure I heard Ann Widdecombe use on the radio one morning. The tabloids are baying, and a Labour home secretary is issuing demeaning vouchers and talking of tough measures against foreigners. William Hague promises a \"removals agency\" to speed the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers and the Daily Mail hires Paul Johnson as his cheerleader: \"I salute Mr Hague for the courage and vigour with which he has broached the issue.\" Johnson assures respectable England in large type that \"the problem of asylum seekers is now the biggest issue in British politics. It affects all of us\".</p> <p>Is it people like my family that he means to define as \"the problem\"? I suspect it is. When my grandfather arrived, he and his brothers could not speak a word of English. And they were not alone in that. The hired gun Paul Johnson himself, flying a much more tolerant flag in his book, A History of the Jews, describes vividly the apprehension he fancies to have been aroused by the appearance in the west of that vast crowd of would-be migrants from Russia: \"These two million refugee Jews were overwhelmingly Yiddish-speaking, Orthodox or Hasidic, wild-eyed and frightened, superstitious, and desperately poor.\"</p> <p>They were described as \"alien hordes\". This was the first modern mass refugee movement. Britain at the time had an open-door policy that allowed any destitute foreigner in without controls. But not for long. Soon it passed its very first immigration law - the Aliens Act of 1905. Its purpose was to exclude as many as possible of these poor Jews from Russia. To that extent, all the arriving \"asylum seekers\" were regarded as \"bogus\" (as we would put it today). They were not allowed to land without a permit from an immigration officer, and could thereafter be expelled for poverty, criminal convictions, or vagrancy.</p> <p>Professor Saskia Sassen from the University of Chicago, one of the most authoritative analysts of world migration flows, points out: \"This act made a distinction between refugees and immigrants; its perspective on refugees was one of political activists or revolutionaries suffering persecution, not masses of poor persecuted people. The Jews were not seen as refugees.\"</p> <p>And the passage of the act had been promoted by years of violent press attacks on these \"bogus\" arrivals. In 1888 the Manchester City News wrote: \"Their unclean habits, their wretched clothing and miserable food enables them to perpetuate existence upon a pittance... They have flooded the market with cheap labour.\"</p> <p>The Mail of those times carried reportage about the arrival of my foreign family and those like them that was even more venomous than its equivalent today. In 1900, its reporter described the passenger liner Cheshire docking in Southampton with \"600 so-called refugees\" among its passengers.</p> <p>\"There were Russian Jews, Polish Jews, German Jews, Peruvian Jews: all kinds of Jews, all manner of Jews. They fought and jostled for the foremost place at the gangways; they rushed and pushed into the troopshed, where the mayor of Southampton... had provided free refreshments. They had breakfasted well on board, but they rushed as though starving at the food. They cursed if they were not quickly served, they helped themselves at will, they thrust the children to the background, they pushed the women... they jostled and upset the weak, they spilled coffee on the ground in wanton waste.</p> <p>\"Incredible as it may seem, the moment they were in the [rail] carriages they played all manners of games at cards, staking sovereigns on a single card. These were the penniless refugees, and when the relief committee passed by they hid their gold and fawned and whined and... asked for money for their train fare.\"</p> <p>My grandfather - as you might expect - told a very different story. Although there were aspects of my own family's flight which did not fit perfectly with the preferred notion of the political refugee, their whole exodus was plainly brought about by the excesses of the Romanov regime and Tsar Nicolas II - \"that wicked tyrant\", as my grandfather referred to him.</p> <p>Abraham Levack and his parents originally lived in Lipcon, outside the town of Kishinev, near the river Pruth which divided Romania from Ukraine as it ran down towards the Black Sea. Their lives were pretty hellish by the sound of it.</p> <p>Successive tsars had sought to shore up the popularity of the crumbling Russian state by bullying and impoverishing the Jews, herding them into reservations, banning them from many occupations, blocking them from education, and conscripting their sons into the lowest ranks of the tsarist army.</p> <p>In 1881 came a first wave of pogroms in Ukraine, with mobs attacking more than 100 Jewish communities. It reverberated as far as England itself, where humanitarian protests were met with the smooth tsarist explanation that popular hostility to the ways of the Jews had led to spontaneous misbehaviour. The authorities certainly intended to stamp it out, they said. The pogroms continued intermittently.</p> <p>The hero of the family was my great-grandmother, Hannah Goldstein. It was she who ran the small holding, with the cow to make cheese for sale, on which the family subsisted. It was she who bore six children. And it was she who was left destitute - still breast-feeding my grandfather at the time - when her husband Solomon Levack injured his leg and contracted gangrene. In 1896, it took him a month to die in a primitive hospital.</p> <p>Hannah Goldstein had got her eldest son out to London at the age of 18 to save him from being drafted into the Russian military. Her 16-year-old daughter followed. Finally, in 1901, she got herself out - illegally - with the rest of the young children. She bribed local Russians who we should today call racketeers, or human smugglers, and they hiked for three nights, until they got past the border guards and safe into Romania.</p> <p>Hannah Goldstein had been wise to run. In 1903 came the big pogrom in Kishinev itself. The details are still commemorated in the history books. While police stood idly by, and Russian newspapers were censored, 45 Jews were killed, and nearly 600 injured and 1,500 homes destroyed by the mob.</p> <p>Hannah's flight was the start of a desperate wandering through Europe that lasted for the next six years, first in Austria and then in Frankfurt, and finally in Holland, in Rotterdam. The plan was to sail to London. \"They charged \u00a35 per person,\" my grandfather Abraham recalled in later years. \"That meant \u00a325 for all of us, but we didn't possess that much.\" Another two years passed before the grown-up children in London could save the cash from their meagre wages and send it across.</p> <p>The refugees' luckier compatriots made it to New York, the true destination of choice for those huddled masses yearning to breathe free. England was always second best. But at last my family got on the boat. They fetched up in the tenements around Brick Lane, part of the swarm of 200,000 Russian Jews who crammed for sanctuary into the east end of London. Thank you, England.</p> <p>But how did the 12-year-old Abraham Levack, his brothers and his mother, beat the hostile provisions of the 1905 Aliens Act and talk their way in? I consulted Nicholas Blake QC, one of England's most prominent immigration lawyers. He pointed out they must have been able to persuade the authorities that they weren't going to be a burden on the state.</p> <p>And they weren't. By God, they weren't! My illiterate grandfather went to school for the first time in his life - to the Jewish free school organised by his own community - for just two years, until he was 14. They taught him to read English, and offered to allow him to stay on until he was 16. It was a hard blow when Hannah Goldstein refused to let him have any more schooling. She needed him to earn money.</p> <p>He wrote to me years later as an old man, saying sadly: \"I very much regret that I had no opportunity to have the fortune of having a good English education, to which I was looking forward so much.\" He underlined the words \"so much\".</p> <p>Instead came a lifetime of ill-paid work - as a shop boy on a bike; helping a cap manufacturer; and finally, 31 years in a hat factory. For that, he became entitled to the old-age pension and lived to the age of 90. Thank you, England.</p> <p>The little Levack family clearly had an ambivalent status back at the dockside in 1907. Many of the general public certainly saw them as \"bogus asylum seekers\" - dirty, illiterate and dangerous; taking the bread out of English mouths. But the new regulations designed to shut them out were relatively porous. After demonstrating years of tenacity, and dragging themselves, sometimes illegally, across the whole breadth of Europe, my forebears did get in.</p> <p>Would they be treated better or worse today, if they turned up on Jack Straw's doorstep? The Russian Jews would have received the same sort of hostile reaction from the Mail and the other tabloids that the Gypsies and the Kosovars get at present. My grandfather and his foreign-looking brothers would no doubt be once again accused these days of picking pockets in any spare time they had left over from raping English girls and spreading diseases.</p> <p>But what about the government? Certainly in some respects, they'd have treated my family much worse while their cases were assessed. If the Home Office had their way, they'd be packed off to some remote part of the country far from friends and support; forced to live on inadequate and humiliating \"asylo\" vouchers; forbidden to work; and denied a speedy decision on their case.</p> <p>As Nicholas Blake points out, the government would also now like to count against my family's request for asylum the two years they spent in Holland, waiting for the boat fare. \"They'd say, 'No way, Jose' and suggest you went back there.\" With its large Jewish population for support and absence of persecution, Rotterdam would be classed as a safe haven. No need to come to England.</p> <p>But it might nevertheless be possible to argue successfully against such a ruling, because we had two close family members already in the UK. In which case, everything would turn on whether we had a \"well- founded fear of persecution\". Poring over the checklist of the questions modern adjudicators must ask themselves, which the Home Office now publishes, I would have thought my grandfather must have had a sporting chance of success on those grounds. Every case has to be looked at \"in the round\", and there's plenty of room for discretion. But the Russian authorities were continuously mistreating the Jews in his \"country of origin\". No doubt of that.</p> <p>All in all, then, my grandfather - who was an absolutely genuine refugee from persecution - would probably still get eventual asylum in this country if he arrived today, just as he did 93 years ago. But he would only be allowed in after enduring both a bad dose of media hostility, and treatment from the Labour government that is in some ways worse than that dished out to suffering migrants in the primitive days of 1907. For that, then, thank you, England.</p> <p><b>First and second generation Britons talk to Pippa Crerar about how their families came to the United Kingdom</b></p> <p><b> Zadie Smith</b> novelist <br></p> <p>\"My mum grew up in Jamaica. Her mum left there when she was seven - to come here to work. Mum stayed behind and was brought up by her grandmother, who died in 1969. So then mum flew to England, aged 15, went to school for two years, then became a typist. She didn't feel England made things easy for her, but the feminist movement gave her different opportunities from what she would have had growing up in the Jamaican countryside.

I think if people are really fleeing from persecution and terror we are obliged to help them. If my parents had come to Britain under today's system, being white would have helped, and also my father's money.\"</p>",

They had breakfasted well on board, but they rushed as though starving at the food. They cursed if they were not quickly served, they helped themselves at will, they thrust the children to the background, they pushed the women... they jostled and upset the weak, they spilled coffee on the ground in wanton waste. \"Incredible as it may seem, the moment they were in the [rail] carriages they played all manners of games at cards, staking sovereigns on a single card. These were the penniless refugees, and when the relief committee passed by they hid their gold and fawned and whined and... asked for money for their train fare.\" My grandfather - as you might expect - told a very different story. Although there were aspects of my own family's flight which did not fit perfectly with the preferred notion of the political refugee, their whole exodus was plainly brought about by the excesses of the Romanov regime and Tsar Nicolas II - \"that wicked tyrant\", as my grandfather referred to him. Abraham Levack and his parents originally lived in Lipcon, outside the town of Kishinev, near the river Pruth which divided Romania from Ukraine as it ran down towards the Black Sea. Their lives were pretty hellish by the sound of it. Successive tsars had sought to shore up the popularity of the crumbling Russian state by bullying and impoverishing the Jews, herding them into reservations, banning them from many occupations, blocking them from education, and conscripting their sons into the lowest ranks of the tsarist army. In 1881 came a first wave of pogroms in Ukraine, with mobs attacking more than 100 Jewish communities. It reverberated as far as England itself, where humanitarian protests were met with the smooth tsarist explanation that popular hostility to the ways of the Jews had led to spontaneous misbehaviour. The authorities certainly intended to stamp it out, they said. The pogroms continued intermittently. The hero of the family was my great-grandmother, Hannah Goldstein. It was she who ran the small holding, with the cow to make cheese for sale, on which the family subsisted. It was she who bore six children. And it was she who was left destitute - still breast-feeding my grandfather at the time - when her husband Solomon Levack injured his leg and contracted gangrene. In 1896, it took him a month to die in a primitive hospital. Hannah Goldstein had got her eldest son out to London at the age of 18 to save him from being drafted into the Russian military. Her 16-year-old daughter followed. Finally, in 1901, she got herself out - illegally - with the rest of the young children. She bribed local Russians who we should today call racketeers, or human smugglers, and they hiked for three nights, until they got past the border guards and safe into Romania. Hannah Goldstein had been wise to run. In 1903 came the big pogrom in Kishinev itself. The details are still commemorated in the history books. While police stood idly by, and Russian newspapers were censored, 45 Jews were killed, and nearly 600 injured and 1,500 homes destroyed by the mob. Hannah's flight was the start of a desperate wandering through Europe that lasted for the next six years, first in Austria and then in Frankfurt, and finally in Holland, in Rotterdam. The plan was to sail to London. \"They charged \u00a35 per person,\" my grandfather Abraham recalled in later years. \"That meant \u00a325 for all of us, but we didn't possess that much.\" Another two years passed before the grown-up children in London could save the cash from their meagre wages and send it across. The refugees' luckier compatriots made it to New York, the true destination of choice for those huddled masses yearning to breathe free. England was always second best. But at last my family got on the boat. They fetched up in the tenements around Brick Lane, part of the swarm of 200,000 Russian Jews who crammed for sanctuary into the east end of London. Thank you, England. But how did the 12-year-old Abraham Levack, his brothers and his mother, beat the hostile provisions of the 1905 Aliens Act and talk their way in? I consulted Nicholas Blake QC, one of England's most prominent immigration lawyers. He pointed out they must have been able to persuade the authorities that they weren't going to be a burden on the state. And they weren't. By God, they weren't! My illiterate grandfather went to school for the first time in his life - to the Jewish free school organised by his own community - for just two years, until he was 14. They taught him to read English, and offered to allow him to stay on until he was 16. It was a hard blow when Hannah Goldstein refused to let him have any more schooling. She needed him to earn money. He wrote to me years later as an old man, saying sadly: \"I very much regret that I had no opportunity to have the fortune of having a good English education, to which I was looking forward so much.\" He underlined the words \"so much\". Instead came a lifetime of ill-paid work - as a shop boy on a bike; helping a cap manufacturer; and finally, 31 years in a hat factory. For that, he became entitled to the old-age pension and lived to the age of 90. Thank you, England. The little Levack family clearly had an ambivalent status back at the dockside in 1907. Many of the general public certainly saw them as \"bogus asylum seekers\" - dirty, illiterate and dangerous; taking the bread out of English mouths. But the new regulations designed to shut them out were relatively porous. After demonstrating years of tenacity, and dragging themselves, sometimes illegally, across the whole breadth of Europe, my forebears did get in. Would they be treated better or worse today, if they turned up on Jack Straw's doorstep? The Russian Jews would have received the same sort of hostile reaction from the Mail and the other tabloids that the Gypsies and the Kosovars get at present. My grandfather and his foreign-looking brothers would no doubt be once again accused these days of picking pockets in any spare time they had left over from raping English girls and spreading diseases. But what about the government? Certainly in some respects, they'd have treated my family much worse while their cases were assessed. If the Home Office had their way, they'd be packed off to some remote part of the country far from friends and support; forced to live on inadequate and humiliating \"asylo\" vouchers; forbidden to work; and denied a speedy decision on their case. As Nicholas Blake points out, the government would also now like to count against my family's request for asylum the two years they spent in Holland, waiting for the boat fare. \"They'd say, 'No way, Jose' and suggest you went back there.\" With its large Jewish population for support and absence of persecution, Rotterdam would be classed as a safe haven. No need to come to England. But it might nevertheless be possible to argue successfully against such a ruling, because we had two close family members already in the UK. In which case, everything would turn on whether we had a \"well- founded fear of persecution\". Poring over the checklist of the questions modern adjudicators must ask themselves, which the Home Office now publishes, I would have thought my grandfather must have had a sporting chance of success on those grounds. Every case has to be looked at \"in the round\", and there's plenty of room for discretion. But the Russian authorities were continuously mistreating the Jews in his \"country of origin\". No doubt of that. All in all, then, my grandfather - who was an absolutely genuine refugee from persecution - would probably still get eventual asylum in this country if he arrived today, just as he did 93 years ago. But he would only be allowed in after enduring both a bad dose of media hostility, and treatment from the Labour government that is in some ways worse than that dished out to suffering migrants in the primitive days of 1907. For that, then, thank you, England. First and second generation Britons talk to Pippa Crerar about how their families came to the United Kingdom Zadie Smith novelist \"My mum grew up in Jamaica. Her mum left there when she was seven - to come here to work. Mum stayed behind and was brought up by her grandmother, who died in 1969. So then mum flew to England, aged 15, went to school for two years, then became a typist. She didn't feel England made things easy for her, but the feminist movement gave her different opportunities from what she would have had growing up in the Jamaican countryside. Mum always had problems getting a flat - it was the same after she married my dad, who's English. Julia Neuberger rabbi \"My grandfather came over from Frankfurt in 1906 to work for his uncle's merchant bank, and my father was born here. My mother came from Germany fairly freely just before the war when she was 22, to be a domestic. Friends lent her money so her family could come over and wouldn't be reliant on the state.The rest of her family perished. I think if people are really fleeing from persecution and terror we are obliged to help them. If my parents had come to Britain under today's system, being white would have helped, and also my father's money.\"",

The gallery has one of the most glamorous sites in the city, with a magnificent pillared gate on the Grand Canal left over from a Renaissance palazzo. The new gallery would be the third Guggenheim in New York. As well as the Frank Lloyd Wright building, a smaller gallery in SoHo was opened in 1992. In 1979, on her death, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection became part of the Guggenheim Foundation. Then in 1997 two new Guggenheims appeared. The Berlin Guggenheim, specialising in German collections reflecting the family's homeland, was developed in partnership with Deutsche Bank, and occupies the ground floor of its headquarters close to the Brandenburg Gate. In the same year the Bilbao Guggenheim was launched and transformed the economy of the rundown post-industrial city at a stroke.",

      "body": "<p>When Nomura International, the Japanese investment bank, yesterday made its agreed \u00a3402m bid for Hyder, formerly Welsh Water, everyone in government and City circles heaved a sigh of relief. </p> <p>Yet some 10 years ago, Peter Lilley, the then trade and industry secretary, was issuing dire threats against foreign companies contemplating buying large chunks of Britain's water industry. </p> <p>The change in attitude is simple to explain.

      "bodyText": "When Nomura International, the Japanese investment bank, yesterday made its agreed \u00a3402m bid for Hyder, formerly Welsh Water, everyone in government and City circles heaved a sigh of relief. Yet some 10 years ago, Peter Lilley, the then trade and industry secretary, was issuing dire threats against foreign companies contemplating buying large chunks of Britain's water industry. The change in attitude is simple to explain. Hyder is in deep trouble and its ambition to become the one-stop shop for utility services in Wales is in tatters. In the years following privatisation of the industry in 1989, the big 10 water companies, including Welsh Water, were regarded as money-making machines for shareholders and directors. Unlike the other privatised utilities the water companies were allowed to increase prices to fund the urgently needed investment in their pipelines and plants, which had been neglected during years of state ownership. The government had offered fat dividends as an incentive to persuade investors to take the industry and its investment liabilities off its hands. But the industry has been swimming in turbulent waters since Labour came to power. It was hit first by the windfall levy, then by government demands for huge extra environmental spending and finally by a new price regime involving big price cuts this year. Hyder had borrowed heavily to fund its investment programmes and its ambitious expansion into the electricity and gas industries. The company had run up debts of \u00a31.9bn. It is now faced with a \u00a31.3bn investment programme over the next five years, and this year alone it has to cut domestic water bills by 10.5% and electricity tariffs by 26%. Ironically Hyder's chief executive, Graham Hawker, was regarded as having good New Labour credentials and Labour used to cite the company as proof that it could \"do business with business\". But Hyder's share price indicates that the firm could not do business with Labour, at least not to its advantage. Its shares, which rose steadily from its offer price of \u00a33, peaked at \u00a310.50 in mid-1998, and have since plunged to less than \u00a32. Bid rumours lifted the price a bit in recent months but Nomura's \u00a32.60 a share bid is still well below the price at which the shares were first offered to the public in 1989. City pressure forced the group to undertake a wide-ranging review of all its operations. Options included sale of part of its business, such as the electricity supply operation, or sale of the whole company. In the end the directors have opted for the latter, leaving Nomura to sort out the mess. The Nomura bid is the work of the bank's London-based principal finance group headed by Guy Hands. It is a measure of Hyder's problems that it should have attracted Mr Hands' attention. He specialises in buying distressed or underperforming assets to turn them around with new management and investment - before selling at a tidy profit. Mr Hands said: \"Hyder's core utilities operations have impressive strengths and benefit from their experienced employees. It also has exciting opportunities through growing its non-regulated businesses, an area which particularly attracts us.\" He is bringing in Mike Kinski, the former head of the Stagecoach transport business, to succeed Mr Hawker as the chief executive. Mr Kinski, who is a director of Scottish Power, built up a reputation as a cost-cutter during his time at Stagecoach. Mr Kinski said he did not expect any further job losses and added that Hyder's head office would remain in Cardiff. His comments will take some of the heat out of the local political situation. There were fears that a new owner would move the utility business out of the principality and impose further cutbacks on the workforce. Hyder has already announced the loss of 1,000 jobs in a bid to meet the productivity levels demanded by the latest water price review. Mr Kinski said Nomura saw Hyder as a long term investment. \"Hyder has an ongoing efficiency programme at the moment,\" he said. \"We don't see the need for job losses over and above those being assessed by Hyder.\" Nomura would aim to grow Hyder's regulated utilities business, but would be examining its non-regulated operations. \"How we grow them [the non-regulated businesses] and what structure they become part of will become evident in the next couple of months,\" Mr Kinski said. There has been speculation that the electricity supply business could be sold. Hyder itself is no stranger to controversy. When as Welsh Water it moved into the private sector, it was much criticised for its diversification into hotels, country clubs and restaurants. It was also thought to have paid top price when it bought South Wales Electricity for \u00a3893m. Following that acquisition, Welsh Water changed its name to Hyder - the Welsh word meaning confidence. In retrospect, it was not an entirely appropriate choice.",

Volatility means people need more facts at their fingertips and more shares are traded, boosting revenue at Instinet, Reuters' online brokerage - especially as it provides dealing services on the US tech stocks index, Nasdaq. Instinet was the star performer in Reuters' first-quarter trading statement yesterday: revenue leapt 58% to \u00a3197m while overall sales edged up 8% to \u00a3832m. The number of transactions on Nasdaq jumped 67% in January and 107% in February. The trend should continue this month, as investors react to huge variations in share prices. Despite this Reuters' own stock has weakened lately - it rose 28p to \u00a310.08 yesterday against a peak of more than \u00a316 last month. This is largely due to a decline in the value of Tibco, the American software business in which Reuters has a 63% stake. Tibco's shares have suffered from the general dot.com malaise, slumping by two-thirds in recent weeks, which means Reuters' investment has fallen from $8bn to $3.5bn. Tibco is still a substantial chunk of Reuters' worth - the group as a whole has a market capitalisation of just over \u00a314bn. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that this is low, given Reuters' collection of other internet associates. Chief executive Peter Job has been talking about a spin-off of the Greenhouse Fund, an incubator with investments in dot.com start-ups, which could attract a price of more than \u00a31bn.

Across the euro zone, Eurostat released the following national inflation rates for March, with those for February in parentheses: Portugal, 1.4% (1.6%); Netherlands, 1.6% (1.5%); France, 1.7% (1.5%); Austria, 2% (2%); Germany, 2.1% (2.1%); Belgium, 2.5% (2.1%); Italy, 2.6% (2.4%); Spain, 3% (3%); Luxembourg, 3% (2.6%); Finland 3.2% (2.7%); Ireland 5% (4.6%). The following were the rates for the other EU nations: Britain, 0.7% (1%); Sweden, 1.4% (1.4%); Greece, 2.8% (2.6%); Denmark, 3% (2.8%).",

Two burnt-out cases - Jeff Bridges' crumpled ex-DJ; Robin Williams's mad ex-professor - cross paths in New York and find salvation in the latter's quest for the Holy Grail. (He is barking.) While it looks great - the city is dark and deeply gothic - you can work too hard at being whimsical, and Williams's twinkling life-affirmations are, well, depressing. This Sporting Life (Lindsay Anderson, 1963) 10.20pm, FilmFour Anderson knuckles down to capture the full earthy flavour of David Storey's bleak, woeful novel. Hardnut Richard Harris batters his way through as Frank Machin, miner turned rugby league star in the days before big salaries and Antipodean sunshine transformed the game. This is dour, and cold, the \"sporting\" deeply ironic as the foolish Frank spurns the plain love of widowed Rachel Roberts. With Alan Badel, Colin Blakely, Arthur Lowe.",

('Cancer link' to nuclear plants, April 13). Coming from a company with the appalling environmental and safety record of BNFL, which - by its own admission - fabricated data in the recent Japanese plutonium shipment scandal and which, according to last Thursday's Guardian, embarked on a dirty tricks campaign to unsettle, discredit and mislead MPs and government ministers, that is rich indeed. The US government - in stark contrast to the British - has acknowledged, after decades of official denial, responsibility for radiation - induced cancers and diseases contracted by its nuclear workers. All of us in Britain should be asking two hard questions. Can Britain's nuclear industry ever be trusted to come clean on sensitive issues involving radiation and public health and safety? And in light of Tony Blair's mystifying silence on the above revelations and continued support of BNFL and all things nuclear, who leads the government's front bench on matters concerning nuclear power and the environment - Tony Blair or the nuclear industry?

If a person fails to meet the asylum criteria for any reason, that does not render his or her application bogus or fraudulent; it is simply an application which has failed. If I apply for a job, I do not become a bogus job seeker just because my application is rejected. Paul Barber Alton, Hants plovers@gn.apc.org \u0095 Can't the Conservatives see that every time they talk about Britain being a \"soft touch for bogus asylum seekers\" they are as good as issuing an invitation to precisely the sort of people they say they want to keep out? Dr M Louise Pirouet Cambridge \u0095 Of course Britain attracts bogus asylum seekers. We have the most bogus asylum any country could wish to offer. Tony Purcell Chelmsford, Essex",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers for the home secretary yesterday began an unprecedented court battle to establish that he alone can decide what constitutes a threat to national security. The case, in the court of appeal, concerns a Pakistani Muslim iman, Shafiq Ur Rehman, who Jack Straw tried to deport in 1998 because of allegations that he gave active support to an armed Kashmiri independence group. The court's ruling will have far reaching consequences for the home secretary's discretion to deport other people suspected of supporting terrorist organisations abroad. Mr Rehman challenged the deportation order and his was the first case to go to the new special immigration appeals commission last year. The commission decided that the home secretary had taken too wide a view of the meaning of national security. After a four day hearing, it found that the term \"national security\" could not mean in the interests of good relations between the UK and another country, in this case India. It also ruled that the home secretary had failed to prove that Mr Rehman had been involved in terrorist activities. During the hearing it emerged from an M15 witness that the security service had tried to recruit Mr Rehman under threat of deportation. He refused. Yesterday Mr Straw appealed against the commission's ruling before Lord Woolf, the master of the rolls, sitting with Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Harrison. Mr Rehman, most of whose family live in the north of England, came to Britain in 1993 and he was given leave to remain until February 1997 to study to become an iman. He is now a priest at an Oldham mosque and has two children born here. In March 1997 he applied for indefinite leave to remain. This was refused. The Home Office claimed he was involved in fundraising and recruiting rebels for the armed mujahideen group Lashkar Tayyaba - which is fighting the Indian army in Kashmir - as well as its legal political wing Markaz Ud Dawawal Irshad (Centre for Invitation to the Divine Teachings). He admitted only sending money for building hospitals and schools in Pakistan. Philip Sales, counsel for the home secretary, said Mr Rehman's activities led directly to the presence in the UK of individuals who were highly committed to a cause, indoctrinated in extremist beliefs and trained in weapons handling. They were people \"who may at some future time or in response to some future perceived provocation, attack other similar groups within the UK with whom they disagree.\" He said the phrase national security had never been defined in statute because \"it is a protean concept, designed to emcompass the many, varied and unpredicatable ways in which the security of the nation may best be protected.\" The courts, he said, have always allowed the home secretary to be the judge of threats to national security. \"It is the secretary of state and the government who have the heavy political responsiblity of protecting national security. \"It is right and proper that the courts, including the commission, should not substitute their view of what national security may require.\" Sibghat Kadri QC, Mr Rehman's counsel, said the commission had been right to decide that Mr Rehman did not pose a threat to UK national security. \"It was entitled to say that the the secretary of state had got it wrong,\" he said. The hearing continues today.",

      "bodyText": "The Clinton administration's policy of engagement with China faces two congressional defeats in the coming weeks as support grows in congress for a tougher stance in defence of Taiwan and the rejection of normal trade relations with Beijing. After weeks of lobbying by groups for and against Beijing, the White House announced yesterday that it intends to sell Taiwan upgraded versions of three medium-range air-to-air and air-to-ship missiles, as well as a new long-range \"Pave Paws\" radar system designed to give early warning of hostile missile and aircraft attacks launched against the island from deep inside the mainland. The carefully calibrated decision is seen as too much by China and too little by Taiwan. Republican congressional leaders have also condemned it as inadequate, given the recent signs of a more aggressive Chinese military posture towards Taiwan. The US critics, led by Jesse Helms, chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, also want the US to sell Taiwan four hi-tech Aegis destroyers, which are equipped with missiles and radar systems that can track up to 100 targets simultaneously. The Taiwanese and Chinese governments have mounted massive congressional lobbying efforts for and against the sale of the Aegis ships, which cost $1.1bn (\u00a3696m) each. \"I am extremely disappointed to learn that the Pentagon has apparently succumbed to pressure from the state department and the White House to sacrifice Taiwan's security in order to appease the dictators in Beijing,\" Mr Helms said. Republican leaders signalled yesterday that they will vote either to add the Aegis ships to the weapons package, a move which would almost certainly be vetoed by President Clinton, or to build the ships anyway for the US navy, so that they could be deployed in north Asian waters to fulfil the same deterrent purpose. The package approved by the administration for sale to Taiwan represents a partial victory for Beijing. It is also a clear sign that the White House remains intent on improving relations with Beijing and liberalising trade rather than making moves which could escalate a crisis over Taiwan in a US election year. But its hope of securing the passage of its China trade bill, scheduled for a crucial vote in the house of representatives on May 22, which will give China permanent trading partner status, suffered a serious blow last night when the house Democratic leader, Dick Gephardt, announced that he would oppose it. His decision could sink the bill, which is the centrepiece of the administration's legislative effort on Capitol Hill this spring.",

The man, said to be in his thirties or forties, tall and with dark hair, was spotted by on least 12 occasions in the area of Fulham where Ms Dando, 37, lived. Detective Inspector Hamish Campbell said police believed all the witnesses had identified the same man, even though their descriptions varied slightly. At least three said he had a trilby on, while others said he wore large glasses and a baggy suit. Det Insp Campbell said the man was likely to be a loner, emotionally isolated, and may have shown an interest in Ms Dando or been infatuated with other women in the past. The Crimewatch presenter was killed by a shot to the back of the head on April 26 last year outside her home on Gowan Avenue. Despite one of the biggest hunts in Metropolitan police history, nobody has been arrested for the crime. Detectives are believed to have all but discounted the theory that Ms Dando was the victim of a professional hitman, after a \u00a3250,000 reward offer and hundreds of inquiries among underworld sources failed to produce a lead. The new clues to a possible killer feature in an appeal on Crimewatch on BBC1 tonight to mark the anniversary of her death. The programme also features an interview with Ms Dando's father, speaking publicly for the first time about her death. Jack Dando, 82, of Westonsuper-Mare, Somerset, told the programme: \"I've come to the conclusion that they will get somebody one day [for the murder] - I'm living in hope that one day he will be caught.\" The man police are hunting was spotted by a workman on three occasions. On Monday April 12 he noticed the man standing outside a nursery school on Munster Road, and he was still there when he came out of a cafe 35 to 40 minutes later. The following Monday, April 19, the workman spotted the man on the corner of Waldon Avenue and Sidbury Street, and he saw him again on Wednesday April 21 at about 11am. He said the man, who was walking down Sidbury Street, became agitated when he noticed that he had spotted him and tried to hide his face by looking at the pavement. Police believe the killer must have an intimate knowledge of firearms because of the way the bullet, a Remington made in or after 1994, was \"crimped\" to hold it into the cartridge. Det Insp Campbell said the man must have used or handled guns in the past. Mr Dando told the programme that the last time he saw his daughter was when he went to London to see a specialist about having an eye operation. \"My eyesight was getting steadily worse, so Jill arranged for me to have a private consultation. \"One of the main reasons was the wedding, and I thought that I was going to have my eyesight much better so I could have walked her up the aisle; but it didn't work out that way.\" Describing the moment he heard his daughter had been murdered, he said: \"I was having my lunch.

      "bodyText": "The government drive to raise education standards is putting children under such pressure that it will not be long before schools report test-induced pupil suicides, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers warned yesterday. The association's annual conference in Belfast unanimously passed a motion objecting to the \"factory farming\" of children and demanding research into the space needed for teaching. Hank Roberts, a north London secondary teacher, said pressure on staff to meet school targets was transmitted to pupils, causing anxiety, irritability and short tempers. \"This government is treading a route to child suicide, as in Japan, because of the intolerable hothouse pressures put on children's learning,\" he said. Last year there were 192 suicides of children under 16 in Japan - a 44% increase on the previous year that was attributed in part to academic pressures. Mr Roberts, a teacher at Copland community school in Wembley, said pressures on children were driven by the government's need to achieve its education targets to secure another Labour victory at the next election. Ministers wanted to extend the school day to 5pm and were promoting after-hours homework clubs, Saturday schools and holiday revision classes. \"It's time to end factory farming and give our kids a bit of free range,\" he said. Pat Bennett, a Lambeth primary teacher, said classrooms needed more space to meet the expanding requirements of the national curriculum. Instead, children were squeezed into a smaller area and that made them more volatile. Peter Smith, the association's general secretary, said: \"Obviously it is right children should be put under some pressure to do their best. \"But we have to make a sensible judgment about the point at which it becomes counter-productive.\" Peter Wilson, director of Young Minds, a mental health charity, said: \"Children respond differently to the testing regime. \"Some rise to it, but our education system doesn't take into consideration children grow up with different levels of ability. For some, testing is demanding and disturbing. \"There are now significant mental health problems for many children who don't have the ability or readiness to cope.\" Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said the teachers were exaggerating. \"I don't accept the country is full of children who are in credibly anxious about their Sats tests after Easter. For ages we put pressure on some of our 11-year-olds because they could not read or write. \"It does mean hard work and a bit more study on the part of the kids, but the bottom line is they go to secondary school with the basic skills they need,\" she said. \u0095 The government yesterday promised \u00a360m to renovate secondary school science labs after a warning from the office for standards in education that 750 do not have the facilities needed to teach the national curriculum. Estelle Morris, the school standards minister, said 400 secondaries would receive cash from the government's capital modernisation fund over the next two years. Ms Morris also announced a \u00a370m grant to give performance incentives to head teachers, deputies and advanced skills teachers. Another \u00a310m will be spent on experimental bursaries for classroom teachers to develop their professional skills. Ms Morris, Labour MP for Yardley, Birmingham, also said Rover car workers at Longbridge would be encouraged to retrain as teachers.",

For much of his working life, he had the advantage of being not at a university but at a small, independent research unit, the Institute of Community Studies in Bethnal Green, east London. Thus, he was doubly close to the working-class people he wrote about - close to them in space, and close to them in spirit.</p> <p>The empathy came from his own past. Willmott was born in Adderbury, near Banbury, where his engineer father owned a garage and ran a rural one-bus service. When the family moved to Luton, Peter became an engineering apprentice in a car factory, although he did not always get on well with his foreman. On one occasion, he made a mistake on his lathe. The foreman was standing over him. \"I do apologise,\" said Peter. \"Are you trying to be fucking funny with me, eh?\" replied the foreman.</p> <p>During the second world war, Willmott was a Bevin boy, working down a mine in the Rhondda valley. He never had good eyesight. Hacking away in narrow seams and peering through the clouds of dust and sweat that coated his glasses, he developed the miners' disease, nystagmus, and was declared unfit for further work below ground. After that, he worked with the Quakers - in the Friends Relief Service and the Friends Ambulance Unit - before getting a place at Ruskin College, Oxford.</p> <p>Not long after that came the most important event in Willmott's life; he met his wife, Phyllis Noble, In the fourth volume of her marvellous autobiography, Joys And Sorrows, she describes how their love was sparked shortly after the end of the war. By then, Peter was working at a Methodist homeless hostel; Phyllis, on her way to becoming an almoner, wanted to find a place for a tramp.</p> <p>\"At first sight of him through the glass panelling, I knew that Peter Willmott seemed less attractive in the flesh than that agreeable voice of his on the telephone had led me to hope,\" she wrote. \"Yet within 10 minutes I was beguiled by his eloquence, in half an hour by his easygoing good humour and charm; and, as I left, I caught myself thinking, I could be happy living with this man . . .</p> <p>\"Ridiculous, really, I thought gloomily. I looked out of the train window, as we clanked along and swerved around the curving track past the shops in Lee High Road, and got ready to get off at the next stop. It was ridiculous, because why should I ever see this man again? Well, I decided I could at least scribble a note to thank him for the visit.\"</p> <p>She risked it and, from that time on, Phyllis was, alongside her solo work, Peter's collaborator and chief support. While Peter was working on Family And Kinship In East London (1957), the first of the Bethnal Green books, he and she lived for three years in the attic of the institute. Their children, Lewis and Michael, went to local schools.</p> <p>Phyllis took them there, and collecting them at the schoolgates and chatting to other mums, she became a sharp observer of the people around us. She was the ethnographer-in-chief, while Peter and I interviewed random samples of the local population. She kept a daily journal, as she has continued to do ever since.</p> <p>Later on, Peter and she, when poverty on its up-and-down cycle had become popular again, directed a large survey of poverty in Europe. While Beatrice and Sidney Webb were the great advocates for the Soviet Union, Phyllis and Peter Willmott were devoting themselves to make something of social democracy in Britain and Europe.</p> <p>Peter came into my life in 1947. He saw a note in the Observer about a Labour party pamphlet I had written, entitled Small Man, Big World. He wrote to me about it and was soon in the party's research department, of which I was secretary, for a time being in charge of propaganda as well as research.</p> <p>He was a natural writer. He became the author and editor of a fortnightly pamphlet, with the jazzy title of Talking Points, which aimed to post useful \"ammunition\" (one of our much overused words at the time) to MPs and party workers around the country. Almost the only way we were like the more professional spin doctors of today was in our enthusiasm. We were spin nurses, perhaps influenced too much by Clement Attlee, who in 1945, in his final appeal to the nation, wrote his own script and read it out from his own handwriting into the BBC microphone.</p> <p>It did not seem such a large step from socialism to sociology, which in Britain was then in its trampolining infancy. For one thing, the words were so similar. We were young and na\u00efve enough to believe that, if we could report, in a convincing way, on the needs and hopes of Labour supporters, even if only in one working-class district, it would help to \"bridge the gap\" (another of our favourite platitudes) with the leadership - and that the leaders might take note.</p> <p>As Peter put it, less party-politically: \"The aim of the institute which we founded was to undertake research, which would both add to basic knowledge about society and illuminate practical questions of social policy, and to publish the findings in a form which would interest the layman as well as the specialist.\" We were ambitious as well as na\u00efve.</p> <p>Family And Kinship In East London was the first book by Willmott and me. Others followed, including Family And Class In A London Suburb (1960) and The Symmetrical Family (1973); there was also The Family Life Of Old People (1957), by Peter Townsend, and Widows And Their Families (1958), by Peter Marris.</p> <p>The Evolution Of A Community (1963) was the first of Willmott's solo books. It was about Dagenham, the largest housing estate in the world, and probably the most dreary. Mrs Adams, one of Peter's informants, remembered how it was in the 1920s: \"I went out for a walk and, when I came back, all the houses looked alike to me. I was in a terrible state, in tears. The workmen said: 'What's the matter ducks?' I said: 'I can't find my house'.\"</p> <p>Another resident, Mrs Hamilton, described how \"there were awful muddy holes in the road, and the women used to pick up bricks from the building site and drop them in the holes to give us stepping stones for our feet on the way back.\"</p> <p>Peter Willmott had a much better story to tell about the 1960s. Dagenham had, in the course of time, become about as stable and settled as Bethnal Green, with extended families almost as thick on the ground, and residents thinking that, on the same unprepossessing site -and with houses as uniform - it was a \"lovely place\".</p> <p>His second book on his own was Adolescent Boys Of East London (1966). It was partly about crime, which was (and is) widespread there. An 18-year-old said: \"We used to thieve now and again, same as anyone else, but I don't think we was bad - it was just a normal thing we used to do.\"</p> <p>A 16-year-old was, in Peter's view, exaggerating only slightly when he said: \"There's not a boy I know who hasn't knocked something off at some time or another\" - they knocked off more than they knocked down.</p> <p>These quotations illustrate one feature of Peter's method. He could talk to anyone, and get them to talk to him. This belonged to the anthropology of the institute in its community studies (the other side was the statistical). We considered the qualitative method essential; indeed, it was the only way to touch on the individual experience.</p> <p>But surveys of random samples were (and are) needed too. The individual's experience has to be put into a context to show how far anyone's experience is, in some way, typical or not. Without random samples, one cannot normally generalise about anything; without picking out individuals, the results of the random sampling can be lifeless.</p> <p>The third feature of our method was to be readable. Since Peter, all members of the \"Bethnal Green school\" have to avoid the jargon which is the curse of sociology. Peter continued in the same vein when, later on, he joined the Policy Studies Institute, and with his further work on communities and the role of friendship, as well as families within them.</p> <p>All Peter's work reflected his personality. He hated bullshit, perhaps especially when it came from academics. He was humorous, and had a lovely laugh. He was intensely interested in all sorts of people. Flim-flam made him roll his nystagmic eyes and smile at the same time, especially if he thought the person he was with would understand the rolling eyes.</p> <p>He mocked the pretentious. Popular beliefs - for example, that the extended family had disappeared, or that \"the family\" was on its way to disaster, or that politicians were a bad lot - were dismissed by him. He did not make loose generalisations. He was commonsense incarnate.</p> <p>He liked good food and, even more, good wine. He made nothing of having been a professor at the University of Paris, the University of London or the University of California. He loved Arsenal. He leaves Phyllis, Lewis and Michael.</p> <p>Peter Willmott, sociologist, born September 18 1923; died on April 8 2000</p>",

I looked out of the train window, as we clanked along and swerved around the curving track past the shops in Lee High Road, and got ready to get off at the next stop. It was ridiculous, because why should I ever see this man again? Well, I decided I could at least scribble a note to thank him for the visit.\" She risked it and, from that time on, Phyllis was, alongside her solo work, Peter's collaborator and chief support. While Peter was working on Family And Kinship In East London (1957), the first of the Bethnal Green books, he and she lived for three years in the attic of the institute. Their children, Lewis and Michael, went to local schools. Phyllis took them there, and collecting them at the schoolgates and chatting to other mums, she became a sharp observer of the people around us. She was the ethnographer-in-chief, while Peter and I interviewed random samples of the local population. She kept a daily journal, as she has continued to do ever since. Later on, Peter and she, when poverty on its up-and-down cycle had become popular again, directed a large survey of poverty in Europe. While Beatrice and Sidney Webb were the great advocates for the Soviet Union, Phyllis and Peter Willmott were devoting themselves to make something of social democracy in Britain and Europe. Peter came into my life in 1947. He saw a note in the Observer about a Labour party pamphlet I had written, entitled Small Man, Big World. He wrote to me about it and was soon in the party's research department, of which I was secretary, for a time being in charge of propaganda as well as research. He was a natural writer. He became the author and editor of a fortnightly pamphlet, with the jazzy title of Talking Points, which aimed to post useful \"ammunition\" (one of our much overused words at the time) to MPs and party workers around the country. Almost the only way we were like the more professional spin doctors of today was in our enthusiasm. We were spin nurses, perhaps influenced too much by Clement Attlee, who in 1945, in his final appeal to the nation, wrote his own script and read it out from his own handwriting into the BBC microphone. It did not seem such a large step from socialism to sociology, which in Britain was then in its trampolining infancy. For one thing, the words were so similar. We were young and na\u00efve enough to believe that, if we could report, in a convincing way, on the needs and hopes of Labour supporters, even if only in one working-class district, it would help to \"bridge the gap\" (another of our favourite platitudes) with the leadership - and that the leaders might take note. As Peter put it, less party-politically: \"The aim of the institute which we founded was to undertake research, which would both add to basic knowledge about society and illuminate practical questions of social policy, and to publish the findings in a form which would interest the layman as well as the specialist.\" We were ambitious as well as na\u00efve. Family And Kinship In East London was the first book by Willmott and me. Others followed, including Family And Class In A London Suburb (1960) and The Symmetrical Family (1973); there was also The Family Life Of Old People (1957), by Peter Townsend, and Widows And Their Families (1958), by Peter Marris. The Evolution Of A Community (1963) was the first of Willmott's solo books. It was about Dagenham, the largest housing estate in the world, and probably the most dreary. Mrs Adams, one of Peter's informants, remembered how it was in the 1920s: \"I went out for a walk and, when I came back, all the houses looked alike to me. I was in a terrible state, in tears. The workmen said: 'What's the matter ducks?' I said: 'I can't find my house'.\" Another resident, Mrs Hamilton, described how \"there were awful muddy holes in the road, and the women used to pick up bricks from the building site and drop them in the holes to give us stepping stones for our feet on the way back.\" Peter Willmott had a much better story to tell about the 1960s. Dagenham had, in the course of time, become about as stable and settled as Bethnal Green, with extended families almost as thick on the ground, and residents thinking that, on the same unprepossessing site -and with houses as uniform - it was a \"lovely place\". His second book on his own was Adolescent Boys Of East London (1966). It was partly about crime, which was (and is) widespread there. An 18-year-old said: \"We used to thieve now and again, same as anyone else, but I don't think we was bad - it was just a normal thing we used to do.\" A 16-year-old was, in Peter's view, exaggerating only slightly when he said: \"There's not a boy I know who hasn't knocked something off at some time or another\" - they knocked off more than they knocked down. These quotations illustrate one feature of Peter's method. He could talk to anyone, and get them to talk to him. This belonged to the anthropology of the institute in its community studies (the other side was the statistical). We considered the qualitative method essential; indeed, it was the only way to touch on the individual experience. But surveys of random samples were (and are) needed too. The individual's experience has to be put into a context to show how far anyone's experience is, in some way, typical or not. Without random samples, one cannot normally generalise about anything; without picking out individuals, the results of the random sampling can be lifeless. The third feature of our method was to be readable. Since Peter, all members of the \"Bethnal Green school\" have to avoid the jargon which is the curse of sociology. Peter continued in the same vein when, later on, he joined the Policy Studies Institute, and with his further work on communities and the role of friendship, as well as families within them. All Peter's work reflected his personality. He hated bullshit, perhaps especially when it came from academics. He was humorous, and had a lovely laugh. He was intensely interested in all sorts of people. Flim-flam made him roll his nystagmic eyes and smile at the same time, especially if he thought the person he was with would understand the rolling eyes. He mocked the pretentious. Popular beliefs - for example, that the extended family had disappeared, or that \"the family\" was on its way to disaster, or that politicians were a bad lot - were dismissed by him. He did not make loose generalisations. He was commonsense incarnate. He liked good food and, even more, good wine. He made nothing of having been a professor at the University of Paris, the University of London or the University of California. He loved Arsenal. He leaves Phyllis, Lewis and Michael. Peter Willmott, sociologist, born September 18 1923; died on April 8 2000",

      "trailText": "<p>Fanny Burney was one of the great writers of her time, admired by the likes of Sheridan and Byron. Now she's making a comeback.</p>",
      "byline": "Kate Chisholm",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the memorial to Fanny Burney is unveiled in Westminster Abbey in June 2002, to mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, she will join Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bront\u00eb sisters as the only women to be commemorated in Poets' Corner. But who reads Burney now? Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch and Jane Eyre still sell millions of copies around the world, but who knows of Burney's novels, such as Evelina, Cecilia or The Wanderer? And yet Burney was a sensation in her lifetime. </p> <p>In 1778, when Burney's first novel, Evelina, was published, everyone wanted to know who had written such a wickedly funny satire on fashionable society. Joshua Reynolds, Edward Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Dr Johnson all praised the novel. And when her last book, The Wanderer, was advertised for publication in 1814, Byron rushed to the printers to read it while it was still in proof. </p> <p>So why has Burney been forgotten? And why is her reputation at last being resurrected? Because Burney was not only a novelist, but also a diarist, ranking alongside Pepys for her insights into the world in which she lived. And, as we have recently discovered, she was also a secret playwright. Burney's comedy A Busy Day, or An Arrival from India is now being given its first-ever full-scale production by the Bristol Old Vic before transferring to the West End. </p> <p>Burney wrote A Busy Day in 1800 while living in Surrey with her husband, General d'Arblay, a penniless exile from the French Revolution. She was desperate for money and thought that perhaps she could emulate Sheridan, who had made over \u00a315,000 (worth about \u00a3750,000 now), from The School for Scandal. Indeed, when Sheridan was running the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, he once asked her to write a play for his next season after reading Evelina. </p> <p>A Busy Day begins when the young heiress, Eliza, arrives back in London from the British trading post of Calcutta to be confronted by her long-lost family. They have come up in the world, having made lots of money in the City, but they are ill at ease in the circles in which they now move. Further misunderstandings and farcical meetings occur when Eliza's family are introduced to the haughty parents of her husband-to-be. </p> <p>Burney, however, never saw her play performed. Before she had the chance to finish it, d'Arblay returned to Paris to recover his lost fortunes, taking advantage of the peace that had been declared between France and Britain.

      "bodyText": "When the memorial to Fanny Burney is unveiled in Westminster Abbey in June 2002, to mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, she will join Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bront\u00eb sisters as the only women to be commemorated in Poets' Corner. But who reads Burney now? Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch and Jane Eyre still sell millions of copies around the world, but who knows of Burney's novels, such as Evelina, Cecilia or The Wanderer? And yet Burney was a sensation in her lifetime. In 1778, when Burney's first novel, Evelina, was published, everyone wanted to know who had written such a wickedly funny satire on fashionable society. Joshua Reynolds, Edward Gibbon, Edmund Burke and Dr Johnson all praised the novel. And when her last book, The Wanderer, was advertised for publication in 1814, Byron rushed to the printers to read it while it was still in proof. So why has Burney been forgotten? And why is her reputation at last being resurrected? Because Burney was not only a novelist, but also a diarist, ranking alongside Pepys for her insights into the world in which she lived. And, as we have recently discovered, she was also a secret playwright. Burney's comedy A Busy Day, or An Arrival from India is now being given its first-ever full-scale production by the Bristol Old Vic before transferring to the West End. Burney wrote A Busy Day in 1800 while living in Surrey with her husband, General d'Arblay, a penniless exile from the French Revolution. She was desperate for money and thought that perhaps she could emulate Sheridan, who had made over \u00a315,000 (worth about \u00a3750,000 now), from The School for Scandal. Indeed, when Sheridan was running the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, he once asked her to write a play for his next season after reading Evelina. A Busy Day begins when the young heiress, Eliza, arrives back in London from the British trading post of Calcutta to be confronted by her long-lost family. They have come up in the world, having made lots of money in the City, but they are ill at ease in the circles in which they now move. Further misunderstandings and farcical meetings occur when Eliza's family are introduced to the haughty parents of her husband-to-be. Burney, however, never saw her play performed. Before she had the chance to finish it, d'Arblay returned to Paris to recover his lost fortunes, taking advantage of the peace that had been declared between France and Britain. Burney and their son Alex followed, and were then trapped on the other side of the Channel when war broke out again. They did not settle back in Britain until after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The experience gave Burney brilliant material for her diaries, and her account of being in Brussels as the troops marched off to Waterloo was used by Thackeray when he came to write Vanity Fair. But it did nothing to advance her ambition to work in the theatre. D'Arblay died not long after their return to Britain, and although Burney went back to live in London, where she had grown up, she never attempted to have her plays staged. She once wrote that writing plays was what \"I have all my life been urged to, &amp; all my life intended - I thought the field more than open\". But this was the beginning of the 19th century and the theatre was an unsuitable occupation for ladies of a certain class. The re-emergence of A Busy Day began in the 50s, when the great Burney scholar Joyce Hemlow discovered the manuscript in the New York Public Library. Hemlow realised that not only had Burney completed her play, she had also prepared it for production, even noting her ideal cast.

This Scott, whose themes were recycled in many a vintage Warner Bros cartoon, has been much celebrated over the past few years, his compositions recorded by the Kronos Quartet, sampled by Soul Coughing, lionised by John Zorn, and programmed in the Meltdown festival by Elvis Costello. </p> <p>The other Raymond Scott is a very different figure. From the 40s on, Scott devoted himself increasingly to developing electronic instruments, and the eccentricity of his jazz compositions took a sharp left into another time zone, acquiring the textures of extreme futurism. This Scott was first unearthed in 1997, when the Basta label reissued his three albums of music for infants, Soothing Sounds for Baby - \"soothing\" being something of a misnomer for their eerie keening and metronome rhythms. </p> <p>The baby music brought Scott belated acclaim as a godfather of minimalist repetition and ambient soundscaping, but the definitive proof of his innovative imagination is now available on Basta's elegantly packaged two-CD set Manhattan Research Inc, named after the company Scott founded in 1946. Manhattan Research was at once a workshop for creating new instruments, a think-tank for speculating on new musical languages and - at bottom dollar - a factory for ad music and jingles, written for clients that included Nescaf\u00e9, General Motors and Vim. </p> <p>The CDs feature many of the instruments devised by Scott: the rhythm-generating Bandito, the Clavivox, the Circle Machine and the Electronium, a \"composing machine\". Unearthly, grating and, indeed, archaic as some of the sounds are, Scott is far more than a whimsical exotic to file away condescendingly under Incredibly Strange Music. His explorations occupied a particular space at the juncture of commerce, science and utopian ideology, where avant-garde thought about sound met mainstream functionalism. The very name of his company combines the image of Manhattan (urban speediness and Madison Avenue, hub of the US ad industry) with that of research (lab coats, circuit diagrams, the dream of manufacturing a better tomorrow). The music embodies a conviction that if only the right sounds could be developed, then the world would be a better place. Not only would babies sleep more soundly, but Auto-Lite spark plugs could be marketed more effectively, oiling the wheels of industry, boosting the economy, and moving us all towards a point where, as Scott's clients Bendix (\"The Tomorrow People!\") confidently forecast, we would soon be visiting hotels on the sea bed or sightseeing on the moon. </p> <p>The urge was, as the Bendix ad put it, \"To research! To discover! To develop!\" There was also a desire to educate, as seen in Scott's collaborations with Muppets creator Jim Henson; in Henson's short film Limbo: The Organised Mind, a stoned-sounding beatnik dude offers a tour, both pedagogic and psychedelic, of his own brain, accompanied by Scott's rhythmic creaks and gurgles. </p> <p>Some of Scott's sound montages are as evocative and densely structured as short films in their own right. One track collaging disparate snatches of sales sloganeering was designed to illustrate the flexibility of Scott's music for commercial purposes. Instead it subverts the ideolog ical confidence of early-60s American advertising in a way that Mad magazine, or a contemporary Soviet satirist, would have envied: \"Don't beat your wife every night - chew Wrigley's, that's a Griffin shine!\" </p> <p>The Manhattan Research collection obviously carries a powerful nostalgic charge. It makes you yearn, on one hand, for a suburban sci-fi world in which every spaceman - and even \"space girls\" (sic) - knew that \"You've just gotta have Hostess Twinkies along!\"; and, on the other, for a DIY age in which electronica couldn't just be bought as ready-wrapped software, but was something to which you had to devote time, space and thousands of feet of wiring. Some of this gee-whiz, frontier-spirit futurism is now being rediscovered by artists such as Mouse on Mars, Add N to (X) and Appliance, electronica acts either devising new gizmos or excavating the future dreams dormant in obsolete technology. </p> <p>Listening to Scott's music now, you could almost believe he invented just about everything electronic that followed. There are fleeting premonitions here of drum'n'bass, of dub reggae, of Stereolab, Devo, Pere Ubu; there's even the keyboard riff of Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground 12 years before its day (in the 70s, Scott was hired to research for Motown with, supposedly, no discernable results). Scott's is a music out of time: in many ways, as wildly wrong in its predictions about sound as the Bendix Corporation was wrong about future lifestyles. Yet his music contains enough pre-echoes to suggest that, rather than having an influence as such, Scott simply travelled through certain points on the circuit board that other musicians would arrive at later. The real 2000 is nothing like the rocket-science utopia that Scott imagined, but his music has somehow become very much the sound of now.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Watching The Villains' Opera last week at the Olivier, a number of questions popped into my head. Who sanctioned it? What did it cost? And would such a soft-brained piece of twaddle ever have passed through the sieving process if it hadn't come in the guise of a would-be popular musical, the holy Grail that these days we are all meant to worship? </p> <p>Since we are now midway through Trevor Nunn's tenureship on the South Bank, it seems a good time not only to ask such questions but to look at the state of the National Theatre. If I am hyper-critical, it is because one has a right to expect more of this theatre than any other. It receives a larger subsidy - rising by six per cent in the coming year to nearly \u00a313m - than any rival theatre. With that privilege come responsibilities. Rather than being a follower of fashion, the National should act as a beacon and standard-bearer to the rest of the British theatre. Is it currently discharging that duty? </p> <p>In one sense, yes. In 1999 the National created a permanent ensemble, which led to a golden string of successes all directed either by Nunn himself or John Caird: Troilus and Cressida, The Merchant of Venice, Candide, Money and Summerfolk. For this, Nunn, the company, and individual performers such as Henry Goodman were showered with awards at the Olivier, Evening Standard and Critics' Circle ceremonies. So that's OK then? God is in his Heaven and all's right with the world. Well no, actually, not quite. </p> <p>My first question concerns the NT repertory and its increasing reliance on musicals as an easy way to fill its nightly quota of 2,500 seats. By March 2001 the NT will have brought us no fewer than five musicals in less than two years: Candide (excellent), Honk! The Ugly Duckling (mediocre), The Villains' Opera (dire), with Singin' in the Rain to come this summer and My Fair Lady, in association with Cameron Mackintosh, next spring. Am I alone in finding this devotion to tune-and-toe shows somewhat excessive? </p> <p>It is all a question of degree. The National's involvement with musicals goes back to the late 60s when Olivier and Tynan planned to revive Guys and Dolls, a classic of the American stage unseen in the West End for a generation. No one could deny that its ultimate realisation, in Richard Eyre's production, was a triumph. But there is all the difference in the world between occasional classic revivals and saturation bombardment. The NT's intensification of its musical programme also comes at a time when the West End itself is about to launch an unprecedented number: this year we look forward, with barely containable excitement, to The King and I, Notre Dame de Paris, Hard Times, La Cava, The Witches of Eastwick, The Beautiful Game and Napoleon, with shows about Dusty Springfield, Mario Lanza and Tammy Wynette rumoured to be on their way. What one craves from the National is some alternative to a musical-dominated commercial culture, rather than a duplication of it. </p> <p>In the field of straight plays, one looks to the National to explore the international repertory in the way it is uniquely equipped to do. In the coming year, however, one finds it sticking to the well-trodden paths of the English-Irish-American repertory. With the exception of Pinter's version of Proust, which bodes well, the only work from the non-English speaking world is Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. The conservative nature of Nunn's taste is summed up by a revival, in a joint venture with Sheffield Theatres, of The Heiress, based on Henry James's Washington Square. Even in 1949, critic TC Worsley classed this rep standby as \"modern melodrama in mid-Victorian dress\". </p> <p>When it comes to new plays, the National has happily just struck lucky with Joe Penhall's admirable Blue/Orange. Not, one might say, before time. To date, the defining characteristic of Nunn's National has been to take previously admired living writers and then stage their worst-ever play. If you think I'm exaggerating, then you have only to call to mind Frank McGuinness's Mutabilitie, Hanif Kureishi's Sleep With Me, Stephen Poliakoff's Remember This and Nick Stafford's Battle Royal. The irony is that under Peter Hall and Richard Eyre new writing was the National's strongest card; under Trevor Nunn it has become its Achilles' heel. One just hopes that, with Penhall's success, a corner has been decisively turned. </p> <p>But if the National, under Trevor Nunn, has enjoyed mixed fortunes, I suspect the answer may lie in the management structure. At the RSC, in the heady years from 1968 to 1986, Nunn enjoyed great success, not least because he surrounded himself with a brilliant team of associates and co-directors: Terry Hands, John Barton, David Jones, Howard Davies, Ron Daniels, Barry Kyle, to name but a few.

      "bodyText": "Watching The Villains' Opera last week at the Olivier, a number of questions popped into my head. Who sanctioned it? What did it cost? And would such a soft-brained piece of twaddle ever have passed through the sieving process if it hadn't come in the guise of a would-be popular musical, the holy Grail that these days we are all meant to worship? Since we are now midway through Trevor Nunn's tenureship on the South Bank, it seems a good time not only to ask such questions but to look at the state of the National Theatre. If I am hyper-critical, it is because one has a right to expect more of this theatre than any other. It receives a larger subsidy - rising by six per cent in the coming year to nearly \u00a313m - than any rival theatre. With that privilege come responsibilities. Rather than being a follower of fashion, the National should act as a beacon and standard-bearer to the rest of the British theatre. Is it currently discharging that duty? In one sense, yes. In 1999 the National created a permanent ensemble, which led to a golden string of successes all directed either by Nunn himself or John Caird: Troilus and Cressida, The Merchant of Venice, Candide, Money and Summerfolk. For this, Nunn, the company, and individual performers such as Henry Goodman were showered with awards at the Olivier, Evening Standard and Critics' Circle ceremonies. So that's OK then? God is in his Heaven and all's right with the world. Well no, actually, not quite. My first question concerns the NT repertory and its increasing reliance on musicals as an easy way to fill its nightly quota of 2,500 seats. By March 2001 the NT will have brought us no fewer than five musicals in less than two years: Candide (excellent), Honk! The Ugly Duckling (mediocre), The Villains' Opera (dire), with Singin' in the Rain to come this summer and My Fair Lady, in association with Cameron Mackintosh, next spring. Am I alone in finding this devotion to tune-and-toe shows somewhat excessive? It is all a question of degree. The National's involvement with musicals goes back to the late 60s when Olivier and Tynan planned to revive Guys and Dolls, a classic of the American stage unseen in the West End for a generation. No one could deny that its ultimate realisation, in Richard Eyre's production, was a triumph. But there is all the difference in the world between occasional classic revivals and saturation bombardment. The NT's intensification of its musical programme also comes at a time when the West End itself is about to launch an unprecedented number: this year we look forward, with barely containable excitement, to The King and I, Notre Dame de Paris, Hard Times, La Cava, The Witches of Eastwick, The Beautiful Game and Napoleon, with shows about Dusty Springfield, Mario Lanza and Tammy Wynette rumoured to be on their way. What one craves from the National is some alternative to a musical-dominated commercial culture, rather than a duplication of it. In the field of straight plays, one looks to the National to explore the international repertory in the way it is uniquely equipped to do. In the coming year, however, one finds it sticking to the well-trodden paths of the English-Irish-American repertory. With the exception of Pinter's version of Proust, which bodes well, the only work from the non-English speaking world is Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard. The conservative nature of Nunn's taste is summed up by a revival, in a joint venture with Sheffield Theatres, of The Heiress, based on Henry James's Washington Square. Even in 1949, critic TC Worsley classed this rep standby as \"modern melodrama in mid-Victorian dress\". When it comes to new plays, the National has happily just struck lucky with Joe Penhall's admirable Blue/Orange. Not, one might say, before time. To date, the defining characteristic of Nunn's National has been to take previously admired living writers and then stage their worst-ever play. If you think I'm exaggerating, then you have only to call to mind Frank McGuinness's Mutabilitie, Hanif Kureishi's Sleep With Me, Stephen Poliakoff's Remember This and Nick Stafford's Battle Royal. The irony is that under Peter Hall and Richard Eyre new writing was the National's strongest card; under Trevor Nunn it has become its Achilles' heel. One just hopes that, with Penhall's success, a corner has been decisively turned. But if the National, under Trevor Nunn, has enjoyed mixed fortunes, I suspect the answer may lie in the management structure. At the RSC, in the heady years from 1968 to 1986, Nunn enjoyed great success, not least because he surrounded himself with a brilliant team of associates and co-directors: Terry Hands, John Barton, David Jones, Howard Davies, Ron Daniels, Barry Kyle, to name but a few. But at the National, while one applauds Nunn's own Stakhanovite labours, there is no comparable sense of a ministry of all the talents; indeed, John Caird seems his sole permanent associate.

Squads of riot police used teargas to dispel crowds of angry youths who rampaged through the city's depressed southern suburbs after midnight, hurling stones and molotov cocktails and setting fire to cars, public buildings and two metro stations.

In what could prove to be a landmark case for Europe's most deprived and fastest growing ethnic group, the parents of the nine- to 15-year-olds claim that their offspring face a lifetime of under-achievement because they were placed in schools for those with learning difficulties. The European Roma Rights Centre in Budapest, which is representing the children - from the north-eastern city of Ostrava - said that the education ministry and local authorities had for decades \"perpetuated a system which routinely brands disproportionate numbers of Gypsies as mentally retarded\". Human rights organisations have long argued that the education system is linguistically and culturally biased against Gypsies and that standard procedures give free rein to \"conscious and unconscious racial prejudice\". A case was lodged with the Czech constitutional court last June, but was rejected in October when the judges ruled that they did not have the authority to make a decision based on statistical evidence. In the district of Ostrava Gypsy children out number non-Gypsies in special schools by a proportion of more than 27 to one. Although they represent less than 5% of all primary school age students in the city, they constitute 50% of the special school population. The Czech government has conceded that nationwide 75% of Romany children attend special schools, making up over half of the special schools' population. The parents are demanding compensatory education for their children, as well as financial recompense and an official apology from the government, acknowledging that Gypsies are systematically under-educated in the Czech Republic because of their ethnic origin. \"I hope that if we win the case my daughter can go back into the mainstream system, but even if that happens she won't have won the battle against racism,\" Berta Cervenakova said. Her 11-year-old daughter Nikol was transferred to a special school three years ago despite achieving average marks at primary school. James Goldston, the American lawyer representing the children, said if the case was successful it could contribute to educational reform throughout the region. \"I don't think we've ever seen this lawsuit as the one and only solution, but this is a contribution to a debate in a field where change needs to happen urgently,\" he said. He added that the case would open the floodgates for similar lawsuits from Gypsies in the Czech Republic and other eastern European countries who were \"similarly plagued\" by the problems of their children being sent to schools for the mentally handicapped. He said that the first case anywhere in post-communist eastern Europe to challenge systematic racism in education marked the \"beginning of a long journey\". \"In the United States it took more than 30 years and dozens and dozens of cases before the supreme court struck down racial segregation in schools, and we're turning to the ECHR to begin the same process here,\" he said. The case could also add legal clout to the asylum applications of Gypsies going to Britain claiming racial discrimination, he added. Gypsy children often start school with little or no knowledge of Czech or speaking an \"ethnolect\" - a mix of Czech, Slovak and Romany. That, plus the fact that their culture stresses oral rather than written skills gets them off to a bad start.

In one famous example a Romany boy was evaluated as mentally handicapped because he could not name \"cutlery\" as the common noun for \"knife\", \"fork\" and \"spoon\", although the word does not exist in Romany. \"Romany children simply do not have a high enough IQ to manage normal schooling,\" said Marta Tepla of the department of special schools in the Ministry of Education. \"If you studied anything about them, you would know that they stick together, they get married in those large families, and they have children with genetic problems. \"You can see this just by looking at their names,\" she added.",

In a significant concession to pensioners' campaigners, the Treasury announced that it would accept the recommendation of the recent Royal Commission on the care of elderly people which called for the Financial Services Authority to oversee long-term care insurance. The move was welcomed last night by the Labour peer Lord Lipsey who had led a backbench rebellion in the Lords against the government's refusal to accept the commission's proposal. Lord Lipsey, a member of the commission, said: \"This is only common sense. Thousands of pensioners will be enormously reassured by this.\" The concession was announced by Lord McIntosh, the Treasury spokesman in the Lords. He said that ministers would introduce measures to monitor the long-term care insurance market once the financial services and markets bill has passed through the Lords.The concession represents a significant victory for campaigners who had warned that the government's failure to act could lead to a scandal on the same level as pensions and mortage missellings of the 1980s and 1990s. At the time of the royal commission report only 23,000 long-term care policies had been taken out. Since then this has increased to 30,000. The industry will grow vastly if, as expected, the government recommends that wealthier people must pay privately for their long-term care. Supporters of regulation say the elderly are at their most vulnerable when they need to enter private long-term care institutions, making them prey to poor insurance products. The royal commission proposal was supported by the Personal Investment Authority and a group of loyal Labour peers, including the former director general of the office of fair trading, Lord Borrie. The Treasury economic secretary, Melanie Johnson, told the rebel Labour peers last month that she was sympathetic to the case for regulation.",

He offered to resign on Monday after losing heavily to Mr Berlusconi in the regional elections but President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi refused the offer and told him to seek a confidence vote. Coalition partners fed up with Italy's first ex-communist prime minister threatened to defect, so Mr D'Alema is expected to quit irrevocably today. Only speed and decisiveness in selecting a successor will avert the general election which Mr Berlusconi's centre-right alliance is demanding, a year early. Mr Berlusconi, a media tycoon and former prime minister, sniffs blood after sweeping the north and key regions in the south with anti-immigration policies. An early election would catch him on a roll and possibly stymie a May 21 referendum to abolish the vestiges of proportional representation, an electoral reform which Mr Berlusconi opposes. The government hopes that by dumping Mr D'Alema it can find a leader to unite its eclectic grouping of greens, social democrats, ex-communists and centrists. Observers were sceptical that the ruling parties, which have spent much of their 18 months in power gouging lumps from each other, could agree on a candidate. The favourite was the treasury minister Giuliano Amato, a former socialist prime minister, who is respected for reining in a budget deficit.

The 53 acres were sold to the city in 1870 for \u00a340,000 by the velvet manufacturers, Listers of Manningham, on the condition that they would always form a public park.

Their bodies were discovered in the house in Scotter, Lincolnshire, on Sunday. </p> <p>A postmortem examination on Monday confirmed the two boys had died from asphyxiation. </p> <p>Fairless separated from his wife six months ago and the couple recently divorced. </p> <p>The children were on their first overnight stay with their father after custody had been worked out when they were murdered in their beds. </p> <p>They were found under the covers in separate bedrooms and Fairless was found hanging in the garage.

      "bodyText": "Boating lake gets a facelift The return of pedalo and park rowing skiff to British culture was celebrated yesterday with the launch of a new series of lottery-funded boating lakes. The first \u00a34.2m project was launched in Bradford by a boatload of civic dignitaries, who circled three acres of fish-stocked and island-dotted water close to the city centre. The Manningham Park lake has been restored, after 30 years of neglect, just in time to rescue from oblivion the boatkeeper's traditional cry: \"Come in number 11, your time is up.\" Local people voted overwhelmingly for a fresh start on the lake and disused boating pavilion as the top priority in restoration of the park. The new lake will be followed this autumn by Britain's first Mughal water garden, a tribute to the large south Asian community in Manningham and modelled on formal hedges, flowerbeds and canals developed by India's ruling dynasty between 1527 and 1857. Local people have advised on plantings, which will follow patterns laid out in Delhi, Agra and other Indian cities. The park's original botanic garden and assorted statues of Victorian worthies will also be re stored in the final phase of the renewal in 2001. The 53 acres were sold to the city in 1870 for \u00a340,000 by the velvet manufacturers, Listers of Manningham, on the condition that they would always form a public park. Martin Wainwright Child killer faced rape charge A father who murdered his two young sons before killing himself was due to stand trial for rape, it was revealed yesterday. Frank Fairless, 36, was due to appear at Gainsborough magistrates court in Lincolnshire next month ac cused of a rape in December of last year. Fairless was also due to stand trial on separate charges of assaulting his wife, Claire, 31, and her father, James Forrington, last Christmas. Fairless killed his sons Christopher, nine, and Oliver, six, in their beds before hanging himself in the garage. Their bodies were discovered in the house in Scotter, Lincolnshire, on Sunday. A postmortem examination on Monday confirmed the two boys had died from asphyxiation. Fairless separated from his wife six months ago and the couple recently divorced. The children were on their first overnight stay with their father after custody had been worked out when they were murdered in their beds. They were found under the covers in separate bedrooms and Fairless was found hanging in the garage. A number of handwritten notes were found at the scene. Court fight over album royalties A widow and a girlfriend of two tragic pop figures are battling in the high court for a share of the royalties of an album they claim was compiled from live tapes taken without their knowledge. Peter Ham and Tommy Evans were in the 70s group Badfinger and wrote the hit song Without You. Both hanged themselves, having received not a penny in royalties for the song. Anne Ferguson, Ham's girlfriend, and Marianne Evans have joined with Badfinger drummer Michael Gibbins and manager Bill Collins against the group's guitarist and vocalist Joey Molland. Molland left the band in 1974 with tapes of a live recording they made at the Agora Club, Cleveland, Ohio. After re-mastering the tapes in America 14 years later, he did a record deal which effectively cut out the other four from any royalties, deputy judge Lord Goldsmith was told. Molland claims he made no secret of having the tapes, and that the other four should pay towards his expenses in re-mastering the tapes. The ruling was reserved. Footballer detained for assault A Premiership footballer who headbutted a young woman was sentenced yesterday to eight months' detention in a young offenders' institution. Derby County striker Marvin Robinson, 20, broke Mary Morris's nose outside the Canal Club in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, last September, the town's crown court was told. Judge Christopher Hodson, who was told that the player's club would stand by him, said the assault could only be marked by a custodial sentence. Michael Anning, prosecuting, said Robinson, who pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to assault occasioning actual bodily harm, attacked Miss Morris, 18, after she told his former girlfriend that he was seeing another girl.

Mr Anning said: \"The defendant emerged from an alleyway and said 'I am going to finish the job'. With that he went up to her and headbutted her.\" Scrapyard search for body Police have called in archaeologists in the search for the remains of a mother who they believe was murdered and bundled into a car which was then fed into a scrap shredder. Forensic teams and staff from Manchester University's field archaeology unit are sieving dust and slurry from the shredder in Stoke-on-Trent in the search for Zoe Simpson, who disappeared in October 1996 from her home in Longsight, Manchester. She would have had a substantial legacy from her father on her 25th birthday two months later. Detectives from Greater Manchester police said yesterday they had extended inquiries to Ms Simpson's home town, Macclesfield, Cheshire. Detective Superintendent Andy Tattersall said: \"There may be people out there who assisted in the removal of her body and the subsequent destruction of her body. \"The net is closing in on them. The time to come forward is now, before we question them.\" Ms Simpson was reported missing by her partner's mother, who cares for her children, Nicole, now 10, and Joseph, four. New information led police to search the scrapyard. David Ward Vitamin link to bowel disease A link has been found between vitamin D deficiency and inflammatory bowel disease, it was disclosed yesterday. Mice genetically engineered to have two human bowel disorders, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, suffered worse symptoms when deprived of vitamin D. But given supplements of the vitamin for two weeks their condition improved. The study, led by Margherita Cantorna at Pennsylvania State University in Philadelphia, is the first to demonstrate the connection. Inflammatory bowel disorders are autoimmune diseases in which the body attacks itself. Previous research has already shown a link between vitamin D and two other autoimmune diseases, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Dr Cantorna, who presented the findings at a conference on experimental biology in San Diego, California, said that the discovery might help in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.",

      "body": "<p>It's the ultimate teenage nightmare. Not only are your parents going to thwart all your efforts at largin' it big time by joining you on your holiday to Ibiza, but they're going to have excruciatingly loud sex in the hotel room next to the one you share with your best friend. What's a would-be mixmaster DJ virgin to do? Kevin and Perry Go Large is an excuse to wallow vicariously in the misery of adolescence. Expanded from a series of sketches on Harry Enfield's Television Programme, it is the story of a grotty, self-deluding teen (Harry Enfield) and his hapless best (only) mate Perry (Kathy Burke) as they embark on a quest to lose their virginity and become superstar DJs into the bargain. </p> <p>For any adult male it is a painfully accurate reminder of the nightmare of having balls that feel like they're about to explode, a face that is exploding on a daily basis, and parents who simply exist. For parents suffering the indignities of being told that their son is \"not your slave\" every time they ask him to pass the salt, it's at least a reassurance that they're not alone. There are gross-out, American-style gags about erections, spots and puke, and very British characters who think they're far cooler, smarter, and better-looking than they really are.\"Kevin came from me, really,\" says Harry Enfield who co-wrote and directed the film. \"I woke up at 14 or 15 and realised that I was a genius with an encyclopedic knowledge of punk music, but my parents were concerned with trivial matters, like whether I picked my socks up or not. They were just ludicrous ignoramuses compared to me, and I became a Jesus-like figure in my own head. They were my Romans, out to persecute me.\" Kevin indulges in similar delusions of grandeur. He imagines his own funeral, surrounded by hysterical relatives and beautiful girls who wished they had realised his genius before it was too late; and he fantasises about being Anne Boleyn's executioner, saving her at the last minute and being rewarded with a shag. </p> <p>Unlike most character comedians, who tend to keep their repertoire to half a dozen guises at the most, Enfield is known for doing such a broad spectrum of characters that it seems a strange choice to take one sketch and stretch it out into an hour and a half's worth of gags big enough to look good on 35mm. \"I've always thought that I wouldn't do a film with any of my characters because it would be an extended sketch. But I really like working with Kathy, and the acting relationship we have is so good, that I thought if anything could work, it would have to be with her. I got together with Dave (Cummings, Enfield's co-writer) and we came up with the idea of doing an English rites-of-passage/gross-out film. Rather than taking British TV sitcoms that went to the big screen and didn't work as our precedent, like Steptoe and Son and On the Buses, we looked to American teen films like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Wayne's World, and planned an English version of that, with all the English quirks that that means. But we got a call from LA [the film was backed by American company Icon Entertainment], saying 'push the envelope', which meant make it disgusting. Squeeze the spots, essentially.\" </p> <p>The American influence is also there in the way that Kevin and Perry is, in its own suburban way, aspirational, with the acne-strewn teens ultimately escaping from their dirty-bedrooms-and-sticky-Kleenex mire. \"I'm not a massive Mike Leigh fan myself,\" says Enfield. \"The British tend to make films that are either a bit rainy or costume dramas. I wanted to do something where we got up and out into the sun and which was ultimately about international rites of passage - we're all like this, it's a hormonal, rather than a social thing.\" But there are certain aspects of our own culture that run too deep to ever be eradicated. \"Films like Bill and Ted always feel about 10 minutes too long because they're only on one level, you're asked to suspend your disbelief when Wayne and Garth suddenly get these Hollywood babes. So we added that British sense of pathos by going one step further - Kathy's a woman and I'm 38. They're monsters, and the girls they go after are fairly monstrous too, and just as awkward. Although they end up being pretty, because I wanted a happy ending of course.\" </p> <p>In the original sketches Kevin is relentlessly nasty, but in the film he gets so knocked back - mainly by girls, but also by the hideous Eyeball Paul (Rhys Ifans), Ibiza's top DJ - that he even starts being nice to his parents. \"The boys are humiliated time after time,\" says Enfield. \"They get vomited on in the nightclub, don't get the girls, and have to leave in disgrace.\" </p> <p>The boys lose their cool entirely over Eyeball Paul: they clean his floor and carry his records, all in the hope that he will listen to their DJ mix tape, before telling them to fuck off. And no matter what he does to them, the boys always have the same response: \"That Eyeball Paul's such a nice bloke!\" \"Though people in the music business tell me Eyeball Paul's just like X or Y,\" says Enfield, \"he was based on my memories of punk gigs, going backstage and being told to fuck off, then walking away saying, 'He told me to fuck off!' It's that optimism that makes Kevin and Perry loveable.\" </p> <p>But Kevin's only truly effective tormentors are his parents, who make his life a living hell by reminding him, night after night, how they brought him into the world in the first place. \"My parents weren't like Kevin's in what they got up to,\" Enfield firmly points out. \"But my relationship with them was like that, and in many ways it still is. My dad, Edward Enfield, is on telly a lot now doing holiday programmes, and I can't watch it, although I think he's really good, and attractive at what he does - I hate to use that word about my father, my backbone's gone all funny just having said the word. I turn into Kevin as soon as I watch him on television.\" </p> <p>It's tempting to imagine what might have happened if Enfield had chosen to adapt any of his other characters for film. \"Because of the relationship I have with Kathy I did have a story for Wayne and Waynetta Slob. It was about them splitting up and everyone mistaking Wayne for David Bailey, but it was one side of a piece of paper.\" The other characters that have made Enfield famous - Tim Nice But Dim, Tory Boy, even Stavros and Loadsamoney - seem very much confined to three-minute sketches, with the exception of one. Norbert Smith: A Life was a brilliant satirical one-off on the history of British cinema through the eyes of a genteel luvvie who had seen it all, from 30s Will Hay comedies through to swinging 60s thrillers. \"That was the first thing I wrote,\" says Enfield. \"It was very stylised stuff. A David Hemmings character saying to a girl, 'Come on you bitch, into the car.' Charlie Higson [his regular collaborator] was in that, and it's interesting seeing his Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased), which has that stylised feel to it.\" </p> <p>Enfield is known for playing other people. Would he ever want to move away from sketch based-comedy to stand-up? \"I'd been on Wogan one time, and the next day this bloke in the street said: 'You're a right cunt in real life, aren't you?' It doesn't bother me if people think like that, but it takes confidence not to do sketches.\" </p> <p>The whole point of Kevin and Perry is that they're desperate to get laid. As their house anthem Big Girl goes, \"All I want to do is do it\". Needless to say, the film reaches a feverish climax. Can there be any future for them now? \"It kind of depends on how much the film makes,\" says Enfield, who at the moment has no future plans, at all. \"I suppose if it's really successful they could wake up and it was all a dream.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Kevin and Perry Go Large opens on Friday.</p>",
