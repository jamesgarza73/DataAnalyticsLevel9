      "body": "<p>The Cathar heretics of Languedoc in France, and their terrible fate, have fascinated people for centuries. The Cathars were dissident, pacifist Christians who believed that an evil deity had created the material world and a good god all the invisible rest. </p> <p>As if to prove Cathar beliefs, the armed might of Rome and Paris exterminated them with such glee that the name given to the Cathars' torment - the Albigensian crusade - still evokes a shiver. In the mid-12th century, the Cathar Perfect, who were hard-working preachers leading lives of poverty, won a threateningly large following in Languedoc, which was then an independent region of traders impatient with the strictures of the Church. Popes vainly pleaded with the nobles of Languedoc to extirpate the heresy, and St Dominic set out on a preaching tour in the 13th century, but it fell on deaf ears. </p> <p>Only when a hated papal legate, Peter of Castelnau, was felled by assassins in the region did the most powerful of medieval popes, Innocent III, find a pretext to enrol northern Europe in a campaign of terror in Languedoc. The crusade began at B\u00e9ziers in 1209, when 20,000 people were slaughtered (\"Kill them all, God will know his own!\" was the order) and lasted 20 bloody years. The greatest Cathar figures - Raymond Roger Trencavel of Carcassonne, Esclarmonde of Foix and Raymond VI of Toulouse - were either killed, or forced into hiding or surrender. </p> <p>The crusade was followed by the birth of the Inquisition, expressly formed to hunt down and burn the remaining Cathars. As inquisitors fanned out over the countryside of Albi, Toulouse and Carcassonne, anyone resisting them was imprisoned, tortured or killed. On March 16, 1244, some 200 Cathars who had withstood a 10-month siege atop their summit hideout of Monts\u00e9gur were marched into a field and burned alive. Although the faith survived fitfully for a few generations, Monts\u00e9gur marked the end of all hope for Catharism. </p> <p>In the 19th century, the subject drew writers - many of them cranks - attracted to the story of the faith's demise. Foremost was Napol\u00e9on Peyrat, an anticlerical bourgeois liberal and talented fabulist, who concocted in the 1870s an account of the Cathars, which, though largely made up, still passes as truth in esoteric circles. </p> <p>His Cathars were heroic, the forefathers of progress in the darkness of Catholic totalitarianism. His heretics hoarded an immense treasure - spiritual and material - at Monts\u00e9gur, and managed, before their incineration, to hide it in the foothills of the Pyrenees. And Esclarmonde of Foix, a high-born Cathar Perfect who may have debated with St Dominic, was transformed, in Peyrat's narrative, into an Occitan Joan of Arc, a virginal high priestess. </p> <p>Thanks to Peyrat, the faith of the Cathars, further bowdlerised by enthusiasts, went on to enliven turn-of-the-century seances, jazz age Orientalist fantasies, Nazi musings, Languedoc separatist diatribes, hippie literature, treasure-hunter tall tales and other alternative writings. \"Esclarmonde of Foix\" began showing up in Paris as a disembodied voice at seances frequented by intellectuals and socialites disgusted, at least for an evening, by 19th-century materialism. The Cathar Perfect were ideal interlocutors for such groups. </p> <p>Fin-de-si\u00e8cle France also saw an explosion of theosophy - a rediscovery of the religions of the east. Among the occult salons and secret societies, Peyrat's Cathars prospered. They went from being proto-liberals to inheritors of a line of eastern wisdom. A neo-Gnostic Church was founded by a man who declared himself the gnostic patriarch of Paris - and, significantly, of Monts\u00e9gur. </p> <p>Peyrat's treasure of Monts\u00e9gur became a cache of ancient knowledge in a theory advanced by an influential occultist, Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan. His friends - Charles Baudelaire, Joris-Karl Huysmans and others - called him Sr, as befitted his self-proclaimed status as descendant of the monarchs of ancient Assyria. P\u00e9ladan-Sr pointed out that Montsalvat, the holy mountain of Wagner's Parsifal and Lohengrin, had to be Monts\u00e9gur. This led to the myth of the Pyrenean Holy Grail, the elusive secret behind western civilisation hidden in the mountains between France and Spain. </p> <p>After the calamity of the first world war, which led to a continent-wide interest in the paranormal, the call of the Cathars was heard beyond France. British spiritualists descended on Monts\u00e9gur, where occultists were busily embroidering Peyrat's narrative, among them D\u00e9odat Roch\u00e9, a notary from a town near Carcassonne. Roch\u00e9 was a disciple of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, which promised its followers direct immediate contact with the spirit world. Roch\u00e9's Cathar-tainted anthroposophy was open to all influences - Hinduism, druidism, gnosis. </p> <p>He made much of cave scratchings near Monts\u00e9gur, claiming they were pentagrams traced by Cathar fugitives to transmit a message to posterity. Any cave graffito not obviously modern was immediately Catharized by Roch\u00e9 (who died in 1978, at the age of 101). </p> <p>Around him was a group of young spiritual seekers, including, for a time, the philosopher Simone Weil. She used an anagrammatic pen-name, Emile Novis, for her articles about medieval Languedoc as a moral utopia. But one of the best distorters and exporters of the legacy of Peyrat was Maurice Magre, a writer of con siderable talent now almost forgotten. In the 20s and 30s, this prolific novelist and essayist (and prodigious consumer of opium) brought the energy of Montparnasse to Catharism. He wrote two Cathar novels, The Blood Of Toulouse and The Treasure Of The Albigensians. In the first he recast the fabulations of Peyrat and caricatured the enemies of the Cathars: the wife of the crusade leader, Simon de Montfort, is described as having rotting teeth, skin the colour of Sicilian lemons, and a big nose. His second, less successful novel presented the Perfect as Buddhists. </p> <p>In 1930 Magre met a young German graduate student in Paris, Otto Rahn. Magre directed Rahn to his friends in the Pyrenees, and the result, in 1933, was a book, Crusade Against The Grail. Rahn assembled all the Pyrenean Grail stories and compared them to the medieval Parzifal, by Wolfram von Eschenbach. Montsalvat became Monts\u00e9gur, Parsifal (or Perceval) became Trencavel, and the guardian of the Grail was the feminised Esclarmonde of Foix. </p> <p>She was guarding a sacred stone, dropped when the angels had fallen from heaven, and hid it in the mountain before the storming of Monts\u00e9gur. This was the true Grail, mistakenly placed (in the 14th-century cycle written by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes) in the north of France and wrongly appropriated by Christian mythology. </p> <p>Rahn's Cathars were pagans; they were also - and this was new - troubadours. His book successfully placed the Cathars at the centre of esoteric Grail studies. Rahn then cast the darkest shadow ever across Cathar country; in 1937, he published The Court Of Lucifer, another Grail book. By this time, he had moved back to Germany and joined the SS. </p> <p> Who were the Cathars, in Rahn's view? \"We do not need the god of Rome, we have our own. We do not need the commandments of Moses, we carry in our hearts the legacy of our ancestors. It is Moses who is imperfect and impure... We, Westerners of nordic blood, we call ourselves Cathars just as Easterners of nordic blood are called Parsees, the Pure. Our heaven is open only to those who are not creatures of an inferior race, or bastards, or slaves. It is open to Aryas. Their name means that they are nobles and lords.\" </p> <p>Rahn's benign Grail speculations and his later Hitlerian take combined. After the second world war, well into the 1970s, a cottage industry of former Vichy collaborators produced innumerable rumours connecting the Nazis to the Cathars. One held that on March 16 1944, the 700th anniversary of Monts\u00e9gur, Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi theorist, overflew the peak in homage. </p> <p>Hitler and his closest advisors were said to have been part of a neo-Cathar pagan secret society. German engineers were said to have excavated Monts\u00e9gur during the Occupation and come away with the Holy Grail. In this last tale (suggesting the films Raiders Of The Lost Ark and its sequel Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade), Esclarmonde's Cathar stone - or, according to extreme right-wingers, a non-Jewish tablet of commandments - was buried in a glacier in the Bavarian Alps just before the fall of Germany. These rumours had stubborn staying power. In 1978 there was a minor diplomatic incident when rowdy German boy scouts were accused by locals of trying to steal blocks of stone from Monts\u00e9gur. The alleged prank was taken as proof that the boys had neo-Nazi leanings. </p> <p>The legacy of Peyrat did not degenerate wholly into nostalgia for the Third Reich. In fact, Rahn's competition overwhelmed him. There was an obvious comparison to be made between Cathars and members of the French Resistance, fighting an invading force. This came up again and again in works published in the 50s. The Cathars - bourgeois liberals, Buddhists, gnostics, Nazis etc - had now joined the maquis. </p> <p>The propaganda of Roch\u00e9 and Magre also led to a serious archeological search of Monts\u00e9gur for signs of hidden chambers and tunnels. Nothing was found. This did not stop Fernand Niel from publishing a study showing Monts\u00e9gur to have been constructed as a solar temple, and including one of his diagrams in a volume he wrote about the Cathars for a French collection of handbooks destined for schools and reference libraries. </p> <p>His explanation of the solar nuances of Cathar construction has since been vitiated by the scientific conclusion that the ruined castle atop Monts\u00e9gur was built long after the Cathar crusade. (The original castle was demolished in the 13th or 14th century, then replaced). The same conclusion about other ruined castles in the Corbi\u00e8res and the Pyrenees has not prevented them becoming \"Cathar castles\" - evocative remnants visited by eco-hikers convinced that they are looking at solar temples destroyed by Catholicism. </p> <p>The 60s updated the lore surrounding Cathars to suit the counter-culture. The babas-cool , French back-to-the-land hippies, made the Pyrenees a prime target for returning to nature and making goat's cheese. When they began arriving in the late 60s, they were met by Dutch Rosicrucians, neo-gnostics from Belgium and other groups who had already moved to Cathar country summer camps. The babas-cool found the idea of the Cathars appealing: they were vegetarians; they were said to disapprove of marriage - therefore they were pro-free love; women could be Perfect - therefore the Cathars were feminists; and they partook of the troubadour love culture of Occita nia. Rock groups serenaded crowds at the foot of Monts\u00e9gur, where the billows of smoke came now only from reefers. </p> <p>British psychiatrist Arthur Guirdham gained notoriety in the 70s through occult books that inspired many Britons to explore south-western France. He described several of his patients who independently exhibited signs of being reincarnated Cathar Perfect. He, himself, is/was Guilhabert de Castres, the greatest of the heretical holy men. Why so many of these Cathar spirits congregated in Bath, the home of Guirdham's practice, is not answered, but his new age updating of Parisian salon seances has proved enduring. </p> <p>By the late 70s, people measured the cosmic vibrations at Cathar castles. Occitan nationalists gathered for ceremonies at Monts\u00e9gur. Weekend archeologists turned up what they always claimed were Cathar crosses, pendants and stone doves. Replicas of these became the staples at craft fairs through Languedoc. Stonehengers and other neo-pagans took an interest. French television did specials on the enigmas of the Cathar story, all more or less inherited from the work of Roch\u00e9 in the 30s. </p> <p>Shortly after Roch\u00e9's death, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln published the most successful book ever about Cathar country: The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail, now past its 35th printing in English. The trio made Catharism a mass phenomenon and turned the international Glastonbury Arthurian followers on to a new medieval romance. The writers took the legacy of Magre, Roch\u00e9 and others and wrote a thoroughly entertaining occult detective story, marketed, however, as non-fiction. </p> <p>The mystery goes like this: at the turn of the 20th century, B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re, a country priest in the remote parish of Rennes-le-Chteau, near Carcassonne, suddenly took to living very well and constructing additions to his church and residence, spending millions of francs. Where did he get them? The short and true answer is that he master-minded a system of mail-order fund-raising and conned local notables into leaving him money in their wills. The long answer is in the 500-plus pages of The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail wherein the priest found the treasure that the Cathars smuggled out of Monts\u00e9gur during the siege. He sold off parts of it, and blackmailed the Vatican. </p> <p> In the book, the Cathar treasure, besides containing an incalculable hoard of Visigothic gold, contained proof that Jesus was not God, but a king who had married Mary Magdalene. Their son founded the line of Merovingian kings, who were, incidentally, Jewish. This secret, along with others debunking the divinity of Jesus, had been found below the Temple of Jerusalem during the Crusades. It had been transmitted to both the Cathars and Knights Templar. </p> <p>The story continues that, after the treasure's narrow escape at Monts\u00e9gur, an occult society had kept the secret to themselves until the priestly discovery at Rennes-le-Chteau. In the past, the secret society was supposed to have been headed by, among others, Leonardo da Vinci, Nicolas Poussin, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Claude Debussy. There are hints that not all of the treasure has been found. Since the book's publication, the land around Rennes-le-Chteau has become pockmarked with the spadework of treasure-hunters. A landing pad for UFOs has been constructed and tours are now conducted through what is a very ordinary country church. </p> <p>The imaginary landscape first outlined by Napol\u00e9on Peyrat has become progressively weirder. The Cathars are now a protean bunch, ready to transform into just about anything that a questing soul could desire. Religious cults of the 80s and 90s used them in lethal delirium: the Order of the Solar Temple - the Franco-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois-Swiss suicide cult - based some of its arcane calculations on the nonsense written about the Cathar castles. </p> <p>The website of Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate cult teemed with references to the asceticism of the Cathars and \"the god hidden behind the god\". He eventually persuaded his followers to commit suicide, in order to go to the \"level beyond human\" - a state similar to that attributed to the Cathar Perfects - and have their souls ascend and speed away in the wake of the real, celestial Hale-Bopp Comet. </p> <p>The Cathar industry continues to expand: wineries, websites, restaurants, estate agents, tinned duck packagers, and many other businesses in modern Languedoc have appropriated the label Cathar. There is also a movie in preparation, a French film, The Hand of God, directed by Yves Lombard, to be released this or next year. The film will deal with the great unsolved mystery of the Cathar drama: who killed Peter of Castelnau? </p> <p>The Cathars are also likely to have a bright future on the internet, a matter-free medium perfect to serve as an echo chamber of esoteric thought. (At least 5,500 websites have already co-opted the Cathar name, if not the original beliefs.) The medieval heresy, which the Catholic church thought it had so successfully quelled, has, thanks to fabulists, cranks, wishful thinkers and romantics, proved remarkably enduring. </p> <p> \u00a9 Stephen O'Shea 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 Excerpt adapted by the author fromThe Perfect Heresy, published by Profile Books at \u00a315 on October 12.

Roch\u00e9 was a disciple of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, which promised its followers direct immediate contact with the spirit world. Roch\u00e9's Cathar-tainted anthroposophy was open to all influences - Hinduism, druidism, gnosis. He made much of cave scratchings near Monts\u00e9gur, claiming they were pentagrams traced by Cathar fugitives to transmit a message to posterity. Any cave graffito not obviously modern was immediately Catharized by Roch\u00e9 (who died in 1978, at the age of 101). Around him was a group of young spiritual seekers, including, for a time, the philosopher Simone Weil. She used an anagrammatic pen-name, Emile Novis, for her articles about medieval Languedoc as a moral utopia. But one of the best distorters and exporters of the legacy of Peyrat was Maurice Magre, a writer of con siderable talent now almost forgotten. In the 20s and 30s, this prolific novelist and essayist (and prodigious consumer of opium) brought the energy of Montparnasse to Catharism. He wrote two Cathar novels, The Blood Of Toulouse and The Treasure Of The Albigensians. In the first he recast the fabulations of Peyrat and caricatured the enemies of the Cathars: the wife of the crusade leader, Simon de Montfort, is described as having rotting teeth, skin the colour of Sicilian lemons, and a big nose. His second, less successful novel presented the Perfect as Buddhists. In 1930 Magre met a young German graduate student in Paris, Otto Rahn. Magre directed Rahn to his friends in the Pyrenees, and the result, in 1933, was a book, Crusade Against The Grail. Rahn assembled all the Pyrenean Grail stories and compared them to the medieval Parzifal, by Wolfram von Eschenbach. Montsalvat became Monts\u00e9gur, Parsifal (or Perceval) became Trencavel, and the guardian of the Grail was the feminised Esclarmonde of Foix. She was guarding a sacred stone, dropped when the angels had fallen from heaven, and hid it in the mountain before the storming of Monts\u00e9gur. This was the true Grail, mistakenly placed (in the 14th-century cycle written by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes) in the north of France and wrongly appropriated by Christian mythology. Rahn's Cathars were pagans; they were also - and this was new - troubadours. His book successfully placed the Cathars at the centre of esoteric Grail studies. Rahn then cast the darkest shadow ever across Cathar country; in 1937, he published The Court Of Lucifer, another Grail book. By this time, he had moved back to Germany and joined the SS. Who were the Cathars, in Rahn's view? \"We do not need the god of Rome, we have our own. We do not need the commandments of Moses, we carry in our hearts the legacy of our ancestors. It is Moses who is imperfect and impure... We, Westerners of nordic blood, we call ourselves Cathars just as Easterners of nordic blood are called Parsees, the Pure. Our heaven is open only to those who are not creatures of an inferior race, or bastards, or slaves. It is open to Aryas. Their name means that they are nobles and lords.\" Rahn's benign Grail speculations and his later Hitlerian take combined. After the second world war, well into the 1970s, a cottage industry of former Vichy collaborators produced innumerable rumours connecting the Nazis to the Cathars. One held that on March 16 1944, the 700th anniversary of Monts\u00e9gur, Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi theorist, overflew the peak in homage. Hitler and his closest advisors were said to have been part of a neo-Cathar pagan secret society. German engineers were said to have excavated Monts\u00e9gur during the Occupation and come away with the Holy Grail. In this last tale (suggesting the films Raiders Of The Lost Ark and its sequel Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade), Esclarmonde's Cathar stone - or, according to extreme right-wingers, a non-Jewish tablet of commandments - was buried in a glacier in the Bavarian Alps just before the fall of Germany. These rumours had stubborn staying power. In 1978 there was a minor diplomatic incident when rowdy German boy scouts were accused by locals of trying to steal blocks of stone from Monts\u00e9gur. The alleged prank was taken as proof that the boys had neo-Nazi leanings. The legacy of Peyrat did not degenerate wholly into nostalgia for the Third Reich. In fact, Rahn's competition overwhelmed him. There was an obvious comparison to be made between Cathars and members of the French Resistance, fighting an invading force. This came up again and again in works published in the 50s. The Cathars - bourgeois liberals, Buddhists, gnostics, Nazis etc - had now joined the maquis. The propaganda of Roch\u00e9 and Magre also led to a serious archeological search of Monts\u00e9gur for signs of hidden chambers and tunnels. Nothing was found. This did not stop Fernand Niel from publishing a study showing Monts\u00e9gur to have been constructed as a solar temple, and including one of his diagrams in a volume he wrote about the Cathars for a French collection of handbooks destined for schools and reference libraries. His explanation of the solar nuances of Cathar construction has since been vitiated by the scientific conclusion that the ruined castle atop Monts\u00e9gur was built long after the Cathar crusade. (The original castle was demolished in the 13th or 14th century, then replaced). The same conclusion about other ruined castles in the Corbi\u00e8res and the Pyrenees has not prevented them becoming \"Cathar castles\" - evocative remnants visited by eco-hikers convinced that they are looking at solar temples destroyed by Catholicism. The 60s updated the lore surrounding Cathars to suit the counter-culture. The babas-cool , French back-to-the-land hippies, made the Pyrenees a prime target for returning to nature and making goat's cheese. When they began arriving in the late 60s, they were met by Dutch Rosicrucians, neo-gnostics from Belgium and other groups who had already moved to Cathar country summer camps. The babas-cool found the idea of the Cathars appealing: they were vegetarians; they were said to disapprove of marriage - therefore they were pro-free love; women could be Perfect - therefore the Cathars were feminists; and they partook of the troubadour love culture of Occita nia. Rock groups serenaded crowds at the foot of Monts\u00e9gur, where the billows of smoke came now only from reefers. British psychiatrist Arthur Guirdham gained notoriety in the 70s through occult books that inspired many Britons to explore south-western France. He described several of his patients who independently exhibited signs of being reincarnated Cathar Perfect. He, himself, is/was Guilhabert de Castres, the greatest of the heretical holy men. Why so many of these Cathar spirits congregated in Bath, the home of Guirdham's practice, is not answered, but his new age updating of Parisian salon seances has proved enduring. By the late 70s, people measured the cosmic vibrations at Cathar castles. Occitan nationalists gathered for ceremonies at Monts\u00e9gur. Weekend archeologists turned up what they always claimed were Cathar crosses, pendants and stone doves. Replicas of these became the staples at craft fairs through Languedoc. Stonehengers and other neo-pagans took an interest. French television did specials on the enigmas of the Cathar story, all more or less inherited from the work of Roch\u00e9 in the 30s. Shortly after Roch\u00e9's death, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln published the most successful book ever about Cathar country: The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail, now past its 35th printing in English. The trio made Catharism a mass phenomenon and turned the international Glastonbury Arthurian followers on to a new medieval romance. The writers took the legacy of Magre, Roch\u00e9 and others and wrote a thoroughly entertaining occult detective story, marketed, however, as non-fiction. The mystery goes like this: at the turn of the 20th century, B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re, a country priest in the remote parish of Rennes-le-Chteau, near Carcassonne, suddenly took to living very well and constructing additions to his church and residence, spending millions of francs. Where did he get them? The short and true answer is that he master-minded a system of mail-order fund-raising and conned local notables into leaving him money in their wills. The long answer is in the 500-plus pages of The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail wherein the priest found the treasure that the Cathars smuggled out of Monts\u00e9gur during the siege. He sold off parts of it, and blackmailed the Vatican. In the book, the Cathar treasure, besides containing an incalculable hoard of Visigothic gold, contained proof that Jesus was not God, but a king who had married Mary Magdalene. Their son founded the line of Merovingian kings, who were, incidentally, Jewish. This secret, along with others debunking the divinity of Jesus, had been found below the Temple of Jerusalem during the Crusades. It had been transmitted to both the Cathars and Knights Templar. The story continues that, after the treasure's narrow escape at Monts\u00e9gur, an occult society had kept the secret to themselves until the priestly discovery at Rennes-le-Chteau. In the past, the secret society was supposed to have been headed by, among others, Leonardo da Vinci, Nicolas Poussin, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Claude Debussy. There are hints that not all of the treasure has been found. Since the book's publication, the land around Rennes-le-Chteau has become pockmarked with the spadework of treasure-hunters. A landing pad for UFOs has been constructed and tours are now conducted through what is a very ordinary country church. The imaginary landscape first outlined by Napol\u00e9on Peyrat has become progressively weirder. The Cathars are now a protean bunch, ready to transform into just about anything that a questing soul could desire. Religious cults of the 80s and 90s used them in lethal delirium: the Order of the Solar Temple - the Franco-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois-Swiss suicide cult - based some of its arcane calculations on the nonsense written about the Cathar castles. The website of Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate cult teemed with references to the asceticism of the Cathars and \"the god hidden behind the god\". He eventually persuaded his followers to commit suicide, in order to go to the \"level beyond human\" - a state similar to that attributed to the Cathar Perfects - and have their souls ascend and speed away in the wake of the real, celestial Hale-Bopp Comet. The Cathar industry continues to expand: wineries, websites, restaurants, estate agents, tinned duck packagers, and many other businesses in modern Languedoc have appropriated the label Cathar. There is also a movie in preparation, a French film, The Hand of God, directed by Yves Lombard, to be released this or next year. The film will deal with the great unsolved mystery of the Cathar drama: who killed Peter of Castelnau? The Cathars are also likely to have a bright future on the internet, a matter-free medium perfect to serve as an echo chamber of esoteric thought. (At least 5,500 websites have already co-opted the Cathar name, if not the original beliefs.) The medieval heresy, which the Catholic church thought it had so successfully quelled, has, thanks to fabulists, cranks, wishful thinkers and romantics, proved remarkably enduring. \u00a9 Stephen O'Shea 2000. \u0095 Excerpt adapted by the author fromThe Perfect Heresy, published by Profile Books at \u00a315 on October 12.

      "body": "<p>\"Pronto?\" I lift the phone in our bedroom. \"My name is Paolo Baldassarre and I wish to speak to the writer Mr Timothy Parks.\" It's a breathless, urgent, demanding voice that drags me back 10 years and more. </p> <p>\"Paolo!\" </p> <p>\"I'll get Rita,\" I tell him; his younger sister, my wife. </p> <p>But he wants to speak to me. </p> <p>\"Next week we'll be seeing each other\" he says. </p> <p>\"That's right. I'm looking forward to it\" </p> <p>\"I want you to know I've changed. I'm very sorry about what happened.\" </p> <p>My last glimpse of Paolo was on the platform at Verona station when I pointed him out to the police. He had announced he was coming to Verona, where I live, to kill me. Shabby, frantic, and obese, he waved three or four bunches of keys as they took him away; he had slipped one round each finger to form a sort of gothic knuckleduster. Shortly afterwards we received a visit from Italy's elite anti-terrorist police. Paolo had written to tell them I was working with Mossad to eliminate Palestinians in Italy. Now, a decade on, I assure him there are no hard feelings. \"I'd like you to help get the Anglo-American sanctions against me lifted,\" he says. \"In time for my release, the year after next.\" </p> <p>He explains that he needs to purchase an academic book called Symbolic Logic. Only the American publisher is demanding \u00a3600 for a hardback edition because of the sanctions against him. He must complete his education before leaving the institute. That is imperative. \"As you know my father never let me study,\" he announces. \"He poisoned my orange juice.\" </p> <p>I mildly suggest that all this is bullshit. \"I bet I can get you a hefty discount on that book, Paolo.\" He changes tack. For five minutes we enjoy a completely normal brother-in-law conversation. \"A presto,\" I sign off. </p> <p>Paolo was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic some 25 years ago when he and Rita were studying in the United States, she at UMass Amherst, he at the University of Albany. The previous semester Paolo had written home asking if his mother would come to live with him. Then at a certain point he had stopped responding to either letters or phone calls. This had gone on for months. Finally Rita took the bus to Albany. She found her brother barricaded in his room in a supposedly supervised dorm, ankle-deep in filth, delirious and hallucinating. Nobody had noticed anything. </p> <p>Sent back from Albany to his family, he began a long series of fruitless, short-lived therapies. He seemed abnormally attached to and at the same time extremely antagonistic towards his parents. Incapable of forming relationships with girls he mailed pornography to his sister and myself. From time to time he disappeared and lived as a bum, practised various kinds of self-mutilation, attempted to buy an Algerian prostitute as a bride, \"ran rings\", as he boasts, round a number of analysts, and read some of the most advanced books on quantum physics ever published. Or at least, those books were purchased for him, often at considerable expense. </p> <p>He was for many years a considerable financial burden, emotional strain and even potential physical danger to his parents. When violent he could be forced to stay in hospital and take the neuroleptic drugs that calmed him down. But then the law required he be released and, being well aware of the long-term negative side effects of the drugs, he stopped taking them. Very soon the paranoid delusions and agitation would begin again. </p> <p>In the end it was only after he had committed a serious crime that he could be imprisoned and forced to take medicine on a regular basis for a long time. This happened seven years ago. Paolo held his mother at knifepoint, then smashed up the family home with a sledgehammer. Since then his parents have visited him fortnightly, first in high-security jails, then in the less restrictive mental institutions. But on New Year's Day 1999 my father-in-law died. Now his wife - we both call her Mamma - who never learned to drive, needs someone else to take her to where Paolo is presently based, way up in the rugged highlands between Genoa and Savona, a place apparently unreachable by public transport. </p> <p>My mother-in-law arrives in Verona on the train from the family home in Pescara some 300 miles to the south on the Adriatic coast. Going to bed at nine she tells us we must be up at the crack of dawn to set off on the drive west to Genoa. She is irritated when Rita and I refuse to start before 7.30am. In the car there's my mother-in-law, my wife, myself and Lucia, our five-year-old daughter. But the presence of little children was never an obstacle to adult conversation in the Baldassarre family. The old lady begins to talk about her husband's bones. Adelmo was buried in the earth, but in Italy the authorities remove the remains after 15 years in order to recycle the space. \"Under no circumstances,\" Mamma says heatedly, \"are those bones ever to be moved into my family tomb. Do you understand that, Rita? I will not have that whoremonger's bones in my family tomb.\" </p> <p>Theirs was an embattled marriage. My father-in-law frequently said the happiest times with Mamma were in the car, he driving while she slept. Towards the end they lived in separate apartments on the same decaying family property. Struck by a massive heart attack, having no phone in his apartment, Adelmo staggered over to knock on her windows in the middle of the night. She called an ambulance and went back to bed, believing he had overeaten again. In hospital he didn't wish to see her and she made no attempt to visit. Three days later he was dead. </p> <p>My wife steers the conversation to Mamma's favourite subject: the possibility that now, after seven years' imprisonment, Paolo will be allowed out for a week in order to come down to visit her in Pescara. Mamma becomes extremely cheerful and excited. There is even a catch in her voice, as of someone looking forward to a week's pure evasion, with a lover perhaps, in any event a bliss beyond which life need never resume again. </p> <p>The institute houses 40 or so men and women who seem emblematic of all that is run-down and futureless, shuffling vacantly from room to room or standing catatonic in corners. After a few minutes Paolo appears. To my immense relief, apart from the hollow, hunted eyes, the hunched shoulders, and the fact that on a hot day he is wearing at least five layers of shirts, jumpers and jackets, he seems pretty normal. We exchange friendly greetings and even a hug. I had not fully understood, despite my wife's warnings, that the difficult person to deal with during this encounter would not be Paolo, but Mamma. \"Look at the make-up she's put on for him,\" Rita had whispered that morning. </p> <p> Immediately Mamma is kissing her son, almost on the lips. She disengages, but only to throw out her arms and embrace him again, kiss again. Seconds later she's adjusting the collar of one of his shirts. It's not straight. It's not clean. And his hair's too long. He hasn't been eating enough. Has he eaten? She apologises that we didn't arrive at 10, as she promised. Paolo merely nods amiably, informing us that he's already had his lunch, but that he'll be happy to sit beside us while we eat at our hotel. </p> <p>Some 30 years ago, in the crazy 60s, a group of psychotherapists concluded that many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, might be related to the family relationships surrounding the sufferers. A form of therapy was developed which involved getting the whole family together and trying to change the way people behaved with each other. Some successes were scored, particularly with anorexia, but any number of sensibilities were offended too. Who wants to hear that they are even indirectly responsible for anything? The feminists ran to the defence of the mothers who were being made scapegoats. Parents' associations complained about public money being spent on such mad ideas. And particularly with chronic schizophrenia, the results of this kind of therapy were disappointing, so it's hardly surprising that by the mid-80s the game was up. The medical profession settled back into its traditional vision that schizophrenia is basically the result of a biological disorder. </p> <p>So today, if you consult the latest literature, you'll be told that the disorder is partly genetic (though how big a part they can't say), or that it may be due to an abnormally large right brain hemisphere (though many schizophrenics don't have this and many who aren't do), or that it's the result of an unidentified virus contracted in the womb but mysteriously clicking in not when they're cutting the umbilical cord, but 20 years later. </p> <p>Observe us, then, as we sit down to lunch, a perfectly \"normal\" family except that 25 years ago one member sadly succumbed to this hypothetical organic anomaly, or gene defect, or virus. The hotel restaurant is empty but the proprietress offers to rustle up tagliatelle and ragout followed by a steak. So far, Paolo's behaviour is exemplary. He is still crazy, already bothering Rita with the story of the hugely expensive Symbolic Logic and international sanctions. But he is calm and pleasant. \"No, no tagliatelle for me,\" he tells the waitress cheerfully. \"I've already had an excellent lunch, thanks.\" </p> <p>\"Bring a plate for him as well,\" his mother says. </p> <p>\"Mamma,\" Rita protests. \"He says he's eaten!,' she tells the waitress. \"Bring a plate for my son,\" the old lady orders. </p> <p>\"Mamma, no, I've had enough.\" </p> <p>\"You're thin,\" she accuses. </p> <p>Proudly, Paolo begins to explain that over the last two months he's managed to lose 10 pounds. </p> <p>\"Bring tagliatelle for him as well!\" </p> <p>\"Mamma, for Christ's sake!\" I wade in. \"The guy's an adult. He knows whether he wants to eat or not!\" </p> <p>\"You understand nothing!\" she yells at me. \"Nothing! He's starving himself.\" </p> <p>But exactly as we gang up against Mamma, Paolo turns his head to the waitress and says, \"Yes, do bring me a plate.\" Then immediately he embraces his mother. He begins to caress her wrists and neck and face. One hand has slipped inside the arm of her short-sleeved dress. She is kissing him. \"Mammina,\" he says. \"Mammina. You're all I have left now. There's only us two. Just a few years together,' he whimpers. \" Povero, povero ,\" she says with immense satisfaction at our expense. But as he pulls away from her, he demands: \"So, have you brought the money? I want my money.\" </p> <p>One of the purposes of these trips is to bring Paolo his monthly spending money. </p> <p>\"We'll have to talk about that later\" Mamma says. </p> <p>\"But you can't not give me my money,\" he whines. </p> <p>\"Tell me about the therapy,\" I ask when we're back in the car. \"Just pills,\" he says. He names an impressive list of drugs, mostly dopamine-blockers, clearly relishing his expertise. \"We're all schizophrenics,\" he says candidly, \"all nuts, so we need these things. Sometimes people do smash the place up, then they get a big injection.\" </p> <p>I begin to notice that Paolo's conversation is mostly normal so long as you don't touch on two key subjects: the reasons for his illness or \"failure in life\", and the possibilities for his future. If this is the effect of a virus, it sure is an odd one. </p> <p>I ask him if they ever try to reduce the amount of drugs, to see if he still needs them. He says yes. \"And how is it?\" \"Fine.\" \"So why don't they reduce them some more?\" \"They can't,\" he says, \"because the levels were stipulated in the sentence that condemned me to my imprisonment.\" \"I bet that's not true,\" I tell him. \"I try to get better,\" he says, \"so that I'll be ready to come out in two years' time.\" I say nothing, because we all know that he can only come out when a psychiatrist decides he's well enough. </p> <p>I can't help but feel he's engaging me in a sort of teasing game, inviting me to discuss serious questions, then suddenly retreating into fantasy when I poke my nose where I shouldn't. In each case these fantasies have to do with things that blocked him in the past or are preventing him from having any future now. In the past there was his father's perfidy, ordering that he couldn't study, couldn't marry and putting poison in his food. Now there is the court ruling about his level of drug treatment and the Anglo-American conspiracy demanding he pay thousands of dollars for books. </p> <p>He turns in his seat. \"Mammina, Mammina. You're the only one who cares for me.\" </p> <p>Mamma smiles and begins to talk about his possible visit to Pescara. \"That would be wonderful,\" he agrees. \"So nice. I can see my old room. You will give me the money, won't you, Mammina?\" </p> <p>At the institute again, two big surprises are in store. The first is a bus stopping right outside. And where does that bus come from? From Savona. So it would be possible, after all, for Mamma to take the train to Savona and then the bus to the institute! We discuss the situation. Paolo is extremely sensible. \"Why on earth come so often, Mamma?\" he asks, \"especially when it's so hot. Wait till October.\" </p> <p>But Mamma has always insisted that she must visit him once a month if possible, once every two months at least, even though the doctors have suggested that these visits have a negative effect on Paolo. </p> <p>\"You can send the money by post,\" he suggests. She says she'll think about it. But as soon as Paolo goes off to the bathroom for a moment, she hisses, \"What on earth am I supposed to do with him if I come without a car? What am I going to say to him all day?\" </p> <p>Briefly I imagine lovers who don't share the same language and who have been forbidden to embrace. What can they do but, as we did, drive around while others do the talking? That is why Rita and I are here, not because Mamma needed transport. We are chaperones to their mad mismatch. </p> <p>When Paolo returns Mamma is very businesslike and says it's time to sort out the money. Reluctantly, she gives him what he wants. </p> <p>The second surprise comes when the psychiatrist finally ushers us in. I'd thought Mamma was going to ask whether Paolo could be granted leave to go down to Pescara. Instead she starts complaining about some detail related to her son's disabled person's pension. She rails about the tangles of Italian bureaucracy. The doctor agrees and seems to think the interview is over. </p> <p>\"But what about the visit to Pescara?\" I ask. Mamma leans over to whisper, \"He'll never grant it. I asked last time.\" But I feel that if we don't ask, the interview will have been wasted. \"We've been wondering,\" I say, \"if Paolo is well enough to spend a few days with the family in Pescara.\" </p> <p>\"What do you think, Paolo?\" he asks. </p> <p>Paolo is clearly unhappy. \"I'd like to go,\" he hesitates, \"so long as no one touches my room here.\" </p> <p>\"Of course nobody will touch it,\" the doctor says. \"That's fine then. Let's say, in three or four months' time, shall we?\" </p> <p> Suddenly I see that the doctor knows perfectly well this visit will never happen because neither Mamma nor Paolo wants it. So his words are completely empty. Vaguely he grants what they vaguely ask. Thus he integrates himself perfectly in the way they operate together. They can fantasise about it, without needing to clinch anything. As soon as we're out Rita asks: \"Paolo, did they ever suggest you have some therapy with the family?\" </p> <p>Actually, I know she knows the answer to this. We discussed it with her father once. Paolo nods. He's very matter-of-fact. He did two sessions with Babbo, he says, but Mamma wouldn't come. </p> <p>\"That's not true,\" she exclaims. </p> <p>\"Yes it is,\" Paolo is mild and matter-of-fact, completely convincing, \"I remember you said you didn't want to come.\" </p> <p>Mamma is furious. \"Do you think I wouldn't have come if it could have been useful for you? I can't believe this!\" </p> <p>Immediately he withdraws and we're back to the Mammina routine. Apparently it is impossible for him to comment openly on his mother's contradictory behaviour, her strange mixture of love and recalcitrance. Or could it be that he actually wants things this way, encourages this behaviour? Certainly there's no question here of any one person being solely to blame, it's more the way each person's behaviour complements the other's that seems so unhealthy. </p> <p>On the drive back, we start talking about the building work that must be done on the family property. But this only leads Mamma to attack Babbo again. \"So why did your father marry me?\" Mamma suddenly demands, \"if all he wanted was his whores and sluts?\" Fortunately little Lucia is asleep. As evening draws on, speeding along this turnpike that my parents-in-law drove up and down so many times, it comes to me that in this family to talk about anything always means to talk about everything, because nothing has ever been resolved between them. The whole family is somehow marooned in the ambiguous behaviour of my father-in-law exactly 50 years ago when he married a woman without apparently wanting to, yet at the same time forever promising that one day there would be the dreamt-of resolution, the whole family together and happy by the sea in Pescara. </p> <p>It's a mentality that fits perfectly with the contemporary and strictly organic approach to schizophrenia. For the time being the patient can be tranquillized on what are truly very sophisticated drugs. If one has to be marooned somewhere, it's as well to keep the anguish levels low. Anyhow, nothing else can be done and it's certainly no one's fault - unless, that is, we're going to be so primitive as to believe that people can really drive each other mad. </p> <p>In the 25 years of Paolo's illness no one has suggested to Mamma that she might look for different ways of behaving with her son. No one has suggested that her weirdly intense relationship with him might have anything to do with the unhappy prevarications of her husband. But then, why bother? In the future, when medical research finally gets there, the whole disorder will be cleared up with an appropriate medicine and everybody can go on behaving exactly as they please. </p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this piece appears in the current issue of Granta magazine: Shrinks, available now in bookshops for \u00a38.99, or direct from Granta for \u00a36.99 or free: Guardian readers can subscribe to Granta for just \u00a321.95 (50% off), and get Shrinks free.

      "bodyText": "\"Pronto?\" I lift the phone in our bedroom. \"My name is Paolo Baldassarre and I wish to speak to the writer Mr Timothy Parks.\" It's a breathless, urgent, demanding voice that drags me back 10 years and more. \"Paolo!\" \"I'll get Rita,\" I tell him; his younger sister, my wife. But he wants to speak to me. \"Next week we'll be seeing each other\" he says. \"That's right. I'm looking forward to it\" \"I want you to know I've changed. I'm very sorry about what happened.\" My last glimpse of Paolo was on the platform at Verona station when I pointed him out to the police. He had announced he was coming to Verona, where I live, to kill me. Shabby, frantic, and obese, he waved three or four bunches of keys as they took him away; he had slipped one round each finger to form a sort of gothic knuckleduster. Shortly afterwards we received a visit from Italy's elite anti-terrorist police. Paolo had written to tell them I was working with Mossad to eliminate Palestinians in Italy. Now, a decade on, I assure him there are no hard feelings. \"I'd like you to help get the Anglo-American sanctions against me lifted,\" he says. \"In time for my release, the year after next.\" He explains that he needs to purchase an academic book called Symbolic Logic. Only the American publisher is demanding \u00a3600 for a hardback edition because of the sanctions against him. He must complete his education before leaving the institute. That is imperative. \"As you know my father never let me study,\" he announces. \"He poisoned my orange juice.\" I mildly suggest that all this is bullshit. \"I bet I can get you a hefty discount on that book, Paolo.\" He changes tack. For five minutes we enjoy a completely normal brother-in-law conversation. \"A presto,\" I sign off. Paolo was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic some 25 years ago when he and Rita were studying in the United States, she at UMass Amherst, he at the University of Albany. The previous semester Paolo had written home asking if his mother would come to live with him. Then at a certain point he had stopped responding to either letters or phone calls. This had gone on for months. Finally Rita took the bus to Albany. She found her brother barricaded in his room in a supposedly supervised dorm, ankle-deep in filth, delirious and hallucinating. Nobody had noticed anything. Sent back from Albany to his family, he began a long series of fruitless, short-lived therapies. He seemed abnormally attached to and at the same time extremely antagonistic towards his parents. Incapable of forming relationships with girls he mailed pornography to his sister and myself. From time to time he disappeared and lived as a bum, practised various kinds of self-mutilation, attempted to buy an Algerian prostitute as a bride, \"ran rings\", as he boasts, round a number of analysts, and read some of the most advanced books on quantum physics ever published. Or at least, those books were purchased for him, often at considerable expense. He was for many years a considerable financial burden, emotional strain and even potential physical danger to his parents. When violent he could be forced to stay in hospital and take the neuroleptic drugs that calmed him down. But then the law required he be released and, being well aware of the long-term negative side effects of the drugs, he stopped taking them. Very soon the paranoid delusions and agitation would begin again. In the end it was only after he had committed a serious crime that he could be imprisoned and forced to take medicine on a regular basis for a long time. This happened seven years ago. Paolo held his mother at knifepoint, then smashed up the family home with a sledgehammer. Since then his parents have visited him fortnightly, first in high-security jails, then in the less restrictive mental institutions. But on New Year's Day 1999 my father-in-law died. Now his wife - we both call her Mamma - who never learned to drive, needs someone else to take her to where Paolo is presently based, way up in the rugged highlands between Genoa and Savona, a place apparently unreachable by public transport. My mother-in-law arrives in Verona on the train from the family home in Pescara some 300 miles to the south on the Adriatic coast. Going to bed at nine she tells us we must be up at the crack of dawn to set off on the drive west to Genoa. She is irritated when Rita and I refuse to start before 7.30am. In the car there's my mother-in-law, my wife, myself and Lucia, our five-year-old daughter. But the presence of little children was never an obstacle to adult conversation in the Baldassarre family. The old lady begins to talk about her husband's bones. Adelmo was buried in the earth, but in Italy the authorities remove the remains after 15 years in order to recycle the space. \"Under no circumstances,\" Mamma says heatedly, \"are those bones ever to be moved into my family tomb. Do you understand that, Rita? I will not have that whoremonger's bones in my family tomb.\" Theirs was an embattled marriage. My father-in-law frequently said the happiest times with Mamma were in the car, he driving while she slept. Towards the end they lived in separate apartments on the same decaying family property. Struck by a massive heart attack, having no phone in his apartment, Adelmo staggered over to knock on her windows in the middle of the night. She called an ambulance and went back to bed, believing he had overeaten again. In hospital he didn't wish to see her and she made no attempt to visit. Three days later he was dead. My wife steers the conversation to Mamma's favourite subject: the possibility that now, after seven years' imprisonment, Paolo will be allowed out for a week in order to come down to visit her in Pescara. Mamma becomes extremely cheerful and excited. There is even a catch in her voice, as of someone looking forward to a week's pure evasion, with a lover perhaps, in any event a bliss beyond which life need never resume again. The institute houses 40 or so men and women who seem emblematic of all that is run-down and futureless, shuffling vacantly from room to room or standing catatonic in corners. After a few minutes Paolo appears. To my immense relief, apart from the hollow, hunted eyes, the hunched shoulders, and the fact that on a hot day he is wearing at least five layers of shirts, jumpers and jackets, he seems pretty normal. We exchange friendly greetings and even a hug. I had not fully understood, despite my wife's warnings, that the difficult person to deal with during this encounter would not be Paolo, but Mamma. \"Look at the make-up she's put on for him,\" Rita had whispered that morning. Immediately Mamma is kissing her son, almost on the lips. She disengages, but only to throw out her arms and embrace him again, kiss again. Seconds later she's adjusting the collar of one of his shirts. It's not straight. It's not clean. And his hair's too long. He hasn't been eating enough. Has he eaten? She apologises that we didn't arrive at 10, as she promised. Paolo merely nods amiably, informing us that he's already had his lunch, but that he'll be happy to sit beside us while we eat at our hotel. Some 30 years ago, in the crazy 60s, a group of psychotherapists concluded that many mental disorders, including schizophrenia, might be related to the family relationships surrounding the sufferers. A form of therapy was developed which involved getting the whole family together and trying to change the way people behaved with each other. Some successes were scored, particularly with anorexia, but any number of sensibilities were offended too. Who wants to hear that they are even indirectly responsible for anything? The feminists ran to the defence of the mothers who were being made scapegoats. Parents' associations complained about public money being spent on such mad ideas. And particularly with chronic schizophrenia, the results of this kind of therapy were disappointing, so it's hardly surprising that by the mid-80s the game was up. The medical profession settled back into its traditional vision that schizophrenia is basically the result of a biological disorder. So today, if you consult the latest literature, you'll be told that the disorder is partly genetic (though how big a part they can't say), or that it may be due to an abnormally large right brain hemisphere (though many schizophrenics don't have this and many who aren't do), or that it's the result of an unidentified virus contracted in the womb but mysteriously clicking in not when they're cutting the umbilical cord, but 20 years later. Observe us, then, as we sit down to lunch, a perfectly \"normal\" family except that 25 years ago one member sadly succumbed to this hypothetical organic anomaly, or gene defect, or virus. The hotel restaurant is empty but the proprietress offers to rustle up tagliatelle and ragout followed by a steak. So far, Paolo's behaviour is exemplary. He is still crazy, already bothering Rita with the story of the hugely expensive Symbolic Logic and international sanctions. But he is calm and pleasant. \"No, no tagliatelle for me,\" he tells the waitress cheerfully. \"I've already had an excellent lunch, thanks.\" \"Bring a plate for him as well,\" his mother says. \"Mamma,\" Rita protests. \"He says he's eaten!,' she tells the waitress. \"Bring a plate for my son,\" the old lady orders. \"Mamma, no, I've had enough.\" \"You're thin,\" she accuses. Proudly, Paolo begins to explain that over the last two months he's managed to lose 10 pounds. \"Bring tagliatelle for him as well!\" \"Mamma, for Christ's sake!\" I wade in. \"The guy's an adult. He knows whether he wants to eat or not!\" \"You understand nothing!\" she yells at me. \"Nothing! He's starving himself.\" But exactly as we gang up against Mamma, Paolo turns his head to the waitress and says, \"Yes, do bring me a plate.\" Then immediately he embraces his mother. He begins to caress her wrists and neck and face. One hand has slipped inside the arm of her short-sleeved dress. She is kissing him. \"Mammina,\" he says. \"Mammina. You're all I have left now. There's only us two. Just a few years together,' he whimpers. \" Povero, povero ,\" she says with immense satisfaction at our expense. But as he pulls away from her, he demands: \"So, have you brought the money? I want my money.\" One of the purposes of these trips is to bring Paolo his monthly spending money. \"We'll have to talk about that later\" Mamma says. \"But you can't not give me my money,\" he whines. \"Tell me about the therapy,\" I ask when we're back in the car. \"Just pills,\" he says. He names an impressive list of drugs, mostly dopamine-blockers, clearly relishing his expertise. \"We're all schizophrenics,\" he says candidly, \"all nuts, so we need these things. Sometimes people do smash the place up, then they get a big injection.\" I begin to notice that Paolo's conversation is mostly normal so long as you don't touch on two key subjects: the reasons for his illness or \"failure in life\", and the possibilities for his future. If this is the effect of a virus, it sure is an odd one. I ask him if they ever try to reduce the amount of drugs, to see if he still needs them. He says yes. \"And how is it?\" \"Fine.\" \"So why don't they reduce them some more?\" \"They can't,\" he says, \"because the levels were stipulated in the sentence that condemned me to my imprisonment.\" \"I bet that's not true,\" I tell him. \"I try to get better,\" he says, \"so that I'll be ready to come out in two years' time.\" I say nothing, because we all know that he can only come out when a psychiatrist decides he's well enough. I can't help but feel he's engaging me in a sort of teasing game, inviting me to discuss serious questions, then suddenly retreating into fantasy when I poke my nose where I shouldn't. In each case these fantasies have to do with things that blocked him in the past or are preventing him from having any future now. In the past there was his father's perfidy, ordering that he couldn't study, couldn't marry and putting poison in his food. Now there is the court ruling about his level of drug treatment and the Anglo-American conspiracy demanding he pay thousands of dollars for books. He turns in his seat. \"Mammina, Mammina. You're the only one who cares for me.\" Mamma smiles and begins to talk about his possible visit to Pescara. \"That would be wonderful,\" he agrees. \"So nice. I can see my old room. You will give me the money, won't you, Mammina?\" At the institute again, two big surprises are in store. The first is a bus stopping right outside. And where does that bus come from? From Savona. So it would be possible, after all, for Mamma to take the train to Savona and then the bus to the institute! We discuss the situation. Paolo is extremely sensible. \"Why on earth come so often, Mamma?\" he asks, \"especially when it's so hot. Wait till October.\" But Mamma has always insisted that she must visit him once a month if possible, once every two months at least, even though the doctors have suggested that these visits have a negative effect on Paolo. \"You can send the money by post,\" he suggests. She says she'll think about it. But as soon as Paolo goes off to the bathroom for a moment, she hisses, \"What on earth am I supposed to do with him if I come without a car? What am I going to say to him all day?\" Briefly I imagine lovers who don't share the same language and who have been forbidden to embrace. What can they do but, as we did, drive around while others do the talking? That is why Rita and I are here, not because Mamma needed transport. We are chaperones to their mad mismatch. When Paolo returns Mamma is very businesslike and says it's time to sort out the money. Reluctantly, she gives him what he wants. The second surprise comes when the psychiatrist finally ushers us in. I'd thought Mamma was going to ask whether Paolo could be granted leave to go down to Pescara. Instead she starts complaining about some detail related to her son's disabled person's pension. She rails about the tangles of Italian bureaucracy. The doctor agrees and seems to think the interview is over. \"But what about the visit to Pescara?\" I ask. Mamma leans over to whisper, \"He'll never grant it. I asked last time.\" But I feel that if we don't ask, the interview will have been wasted. \"We've been wondering,\" I say, \"if Paolo is well enough to spend a few days with the family in Pescara.\" \"What do you think, Paolo?\" he asks. Paolo is clearly unhappy. \"I'd like to go,\" he hesitates, \"so long as no one touches my room here.\" \"Of course nobody will touch it,\" the doctor says. \"That's fine then. Let's say, in three or four months' time, shall we?\" Suddenly I see that the doctor knows perfectly well this visit will never happen because neither Mamma nor Paolo wants it. So his words are completely empty. Vaguely he grants what they vaguely ask. Thus he integrates himself perfectly in the way they operate together. They can fantasise about it, without needing to clinch anything. As soon as we're out Rita asks: \"Paolo, did they ever suggest you have some therapy with the family?\" Actually, I know she knows the answer to this. We discussed it with her father once. Paolo nods. He's very matter-of-fact. He did two sessions with Babbo, he says, but Mamma wouldn't come. \"That's not true,\" she exclaims. \"Yes it is,\" Paolo is mild and matter-of-fact, completely convincing, \"I remember you said you didn't want to come.\" Mamma is furious. \"Do you think I wouldn't have come if it could have been useful for you? I can't believe this!\" Immediately he withdraws and we're back to the Mammina routine. Apparently it is impossible for him to comment openly on his mother's contradictory behaviour, her strange mixture of love and recalcitrance. Or could it be that he actually wants things this way, encourages this behaviour? Certainly there's no question here of any one person being solely to blame, it's more the way each person's behaviour complements the other's that seems so unhealthy. On the drive back, we start talking about the building work that must be done on the family property. But this only leads Mamma to attack Babbo again. \"So why did your father marry me?\" Mamma suddenly demands, \"if all he wanted was his whores and sluts?\" Fortunately little Lucia is asleep. As evening draws on, speeding along this turnpike that my parents-in-law drove up and down so many times, it comes to me that in this family to talk about anything always means to talk about everything, because nothing has ever been resolved between them. The whole family is somehow marooned in the ambiguous behaviour of my father-in-law exactly 50 years ago when he married a woman without apparently wanting to, yet at the same time forever promising that one day there would be the dreamt-of resolution, the whole family together and happy by the sea in Pescara. It's a mentality that fits perfectly with the contemporary and strictly organic approach to schizophrenia. For the time being the patient can be tranquillized on what are truly very sophisticated drugs. If one has to be marooned somewhere, it's as well to keep the anguish levels low. Anyhow, nothing else can be done and it's certainly no one's fault - unless, that is, we're going to be so primitive as to believe that people can really drive each other mad. In the 25 years of Paolo's illness no one has suggested to Mamma that she might look for different ways of behaving with her son. No one has suggested that her weirdly intense relationship with him might have anything to do with the unhappy prevarications of her husband. But then, why bother? In the future, when medical research finally gets there, the whole disorder will be cleared up with an appropriate medicine and everybody can go on behaving exactly as they please. \u0095 A longer version of this piece appears in the current issue of Granta magazine: Shrinks, available now in bookshops for \u00a38.99, or direct from Granta for \u00a36.99 or free: Guardian readers can subscribe to Granta for just \u00a321.95 (50% off), and get Shrinks free.

      "body": "<p>I have just one certificate stuck to the cork board above my desk, but what I did to get it is something I'm particularly proud of, and also a little embarrassed about. It certifies that I successfully completed a flight aboard a British Airways aircraft - there is even a photograph of the very plane, a Boeing 757, way above the white cliffs of Dover. When I look at this picture, I often wonder how I got through this flight. Perhaps I should have made a lunge for the emergency exit and bailed out. Or kicked and screamed until the pilot turned back. You see, I did once get off an aircraft shortly before it taxied to the runway. That was a couple of years before I undertook the fear-of-flying course; a couple of years during which I steadily lost touch with reality. </p> <p>Fear of flying is totally irrational, or so I've been told countless times, but when you experience it, it seems the most logical thing in the world. And it can take your breath away, literally, because it's not just a mental condition; it has powerful physical symptoms, too. What might at first seem to be a dull ache in your stomach quickly spreads throughout your body, so you hurt all over. Meanwhile, your heart rate begins to shoot up, along with your blood pressure, and you start to sweat profusely. You become nauseous. And everything appears to close in around you. You feel as if you are about to implode. You don't exactly feel rigid with fear, more you just feel totally crushed by it. </p> <p>The symptoms first manifested themselves on a Swissair Airbus that was about to depart Geneva for London Heathrow. They were so bad that neither the cabin crew, or even my uncle with whom I was travelling, could have persuaded me to stay on board. </p> <p>Perspiring and shaking wildly, I finally stood up, grabbed my hand luggage, muttered something to my uncle about taking the train, and stumbled for the exit. I didn't look back. I was allowed to get off because the plane had been delayed for more than an hour-and-a-half due to a \"technical problem\", and a few other businessmen sitting in the front of the plane were also getting off, though clearly for very different reasons. </p> <p>Had there not been a \"technical problem\", I'm pretty sure I would have completed this flight, albeit very nervously. As it was, the longer we sat on the Tarmac, with men in overalls wandering on board every so often, the more anxious I became. In fact, at one point the plane actually pushed back from the stand and was heading for the runway, engines roaring, or, rather, sort of whining, only to return a number of minutes later. The pilot eventually explained that a computer would have to be changed, although this was a pretty quick operation and we would be off shortly. I, however, couldn't help thinking that it would be a lot easier to get off - after a while, I couldn't bare to look at what was going on (in retrospect, I think this was because I didn't want to witness an engineer making a mistake, not that I would have known what that would have looked like). With each new setback, I was more convinced that this plane was never going to make it to London and that it was going to crash, that we were all going to die, gruesomely - my anxiety and the corresponding physical symptoms spiralling ever more out of control. </p> <p>The source of my phobia was a Swissair Airbus (for all I know, it might have been the very same) leaving Geneva for London almost one year earlier. Everything was going smoothly that day. There were no delays, the evening sky appeared clear - a beautiful, deep mauve colour with a few snowy peaks just visible. Travelling for work, I happened to be sitting in the business section and was more concerned with the newspaper I had been handed than anything that was going on around me. We took off right on schedule - that I remember, as I was eager to get back in time for dinner with my fianc\u00e9e. A few seconds later, just as we were at what seemed to be the steepest (and slowest) point of the climb, there was a huge bang, an explosive bang. An electric-blue flash shot through the cabin, along the side walls and aisle, the overhead lockers and right under my feet. A number of people screamed, though not at the front of the plane, not in business class. Then there was this eerie silence. No one even rustled their paper as we waited for the plane to start tumbling back to earth. </p> <p>My first thought was, wow, I'm going to die in a plane crash. Me. Why me? And why now? I had just got engaged. I had recently sold my first novel. I had a terrific new job. For about the first time in my life everything was going right. Then wham. But instead of plunging to earth, the plane kept on climbing. Up in the plush business section, we started to look at one another quizzically. After what seemed like for ever, but what must have been four or five minutes, the pilot came on the PA to say that the plane had been hit by lightning but there was nothing to worry about. They had run a number of checks and we were to continue to London Heathrow, where we were still expected to land on time. </p> <p>Over the next year I flew a great deal - I had little option. My \"terrific\" new job was in fact travel editor of an international newspaper. Refusing to accept that I had suddenly become afraid of flying - I never talked about the lightning strike - I found myself drinking more and more heavily before I got on a plane. And then I started making up all sorts of excuses to get out of going on trips, particularly those involving developing countries or eastern European airlines, or airlines that used Airbuses. I'd ring ahead to check. Looking back, I see that I turned down Brazil, Mexico, Morocco twice, Budapest and Prague. </p> <p>As well as the alcohol, I also began consuming handfuls of beta-blockers that my doctor had prescribed for me. Beta-blockers are meant to help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, and with those out of the way, without your heart pumping like mad, it's supposedly easier to think about something other than your anxiety - though I think that I found the drink more effective. When I went to New York on Concorde, I consumed so much Dom P\u00e9rignon 1985 Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon that we could have left the stratosphere completely and zoomed off into space for all I would have known. Then I tried to go everywhere on Eurostar, and despite on one occasion being stuck in the tunnel for four hours (three of which were in darkness), I still vastly preferred the experience to flying. It simply didn't set my mind racing with so many catastrophic thoughts. </p> <p>Yet why I let myself in for another Geneva hop, on Swissair, almost exactly a year after I thought I was going to be in a fatal crash, I still can't quite explain - perhaps I was testing myself. However, once on the Tarmac, in this Airbus that obviously had a serious technical problem, I knew I wouldn't be so lucky a second time - I had already been warned. My fate was sealed. Suddenly flying didn't just frighten me; I had developed a phobia about it. All rationality had gone out of the window. Why would Swissair, an airline with one of the best safety records in the world, allow a dodgy plane to take off? </p> <p>Of course, I knew that nothing would happen to the plane - I left my uncle on it, after all - just as I knew flying was one of the safest forms of travel. Still, I was glad I got off that plane. I remember walking through the terminal building, heading for the train, feeling a huge weight had lifted. I suppose in succumbing to my anxiety, my phobia, I at least recognised that I had a problem. </p> <p>For a while I let things get really out of hand. I read everything I could find about planes and their safety records. Regardless of the statistics, I would always come to the conclusion that none of them was that safe. There was always a crash somewhere to prove my point, or suddenly a plane with an impeccable safety record, such as the Concorde, would fall appallingly out of the sky. </p> <p>I pored over articles on specific crashes - the Valujet DC-9 that slammed into a Florida swamp, the TWA Boeing 747 that blew up in midair just out of JFK, the Swissair MD11 that came down in Nova Scotia, the Romanian A310 that barely had time to become airborne after leaving Bucharest airport. I read somewhere that all the pathologist had to identify the pilot of a Boeing 737 (the most popular commercial jet in the world) that crashed in Pittsburgh was the sole of his foot, a slither of charred flesh. A friend, who works for a big City bank, passed me an internal report that graded airlines by their safety records so its employees could decide which they would feel happiest flying with. I can tell you that at the bottom of this listwas Macedonian Airlines, closely followed by Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan Airlines and Orbi Georgian Airlines - not, of course, that I had ever flown with any of these. </p> <p>A short while later, the same friend (friend?) passed me some information that I thought at the time proved my phobia wasn't quite so irrational, that I'd been on the right track all along. It included the terrifying fact that cars are actually 12 times safer than planes and that, of all modes of transport, only motorbikes are more dangerous. This statistic was arrived at by calculating the number of trips taken, as opposed to the norm of looking at the deaths per distances travelled. Even, apparently, if you measure the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure to a particular form of transport, cars and planes come out pretty evenly. </p> <p>Gradually, I became aware of not just how common my condition was, but that I wasn't the only travel writer who was afraid of flying. Aside from numerous tales of head-banging turbulence and engine fires, aborted takeoffs and undercarriage failures, many of my former colleagues feared that because they flew so much, by the law of averages one day their time would be up. But regardless of all this, and irrespective of how you skew the figures (and even if there has just been a terrible crash - you can usually find at least one major incident in the world in any given month), flying is remarkably safe, and getting safer. The overall accident rate per flight stands at one in a million, well down from 50 in a million in the 60s. </p> <p>Yet, to the phobic mind, these figures are meaningless - the plane you are on is going to crash, and nothing anyone says can distract you from that thought. I like to think that I eventually left my travel editor job for other reasons (to concentrate on my novel-writing, say, and to spend more time with my new wife), but it is conceivable that my fear of flying played a considerable part. </p> <p>With my feet planted firmly on the ground, I began to question why flying affects so many people in such a negative way (some say up to half the adult population fear it) - why exactly it generates all this anxiety. I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane without my palms becoming clammy and this heaving sensation starting up in my chest. In fact, I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane again. Why was I being so bloody irrational about it? I just couldn't get my mind to accept the reality of the situation - that I wasn't going to die every time I stepped on to a plane, even if it were to be involved in an incident. Planes are obviously well built enough to withstand lightning strikes, as well as all sorts of mechanical and systems failures. I then started to think about the nature of phobias. My doctor intimated that what most phobias ultimately do is mask some other, probably deeper-rooted anxiety. So what else was troubling me? What had the Geneva incident really triggered? </p> <p>By the time I eventually enrolled on a fear-of-flying course, I had already got somewhere with containing my phobia, even if I hadn't yet got that far with understanding what lay behind it. I had decided to set my next novel on a plane, thinking that an object capable of inspiring such powerful feelings in me would provide great source material. Or, if you like, I wanted to put my obsession, my pre-eminent anxiety, to good use. Plus, I've always thought of my writing as a kind of therapy, a way of exorcising demons, of trying to confront long-buried issues - of working out who I am and where I come from. And I also wanted to know what made the cabin crew tick, what made them able to spend their lives flying around the world fearlessly. As it was, I soon discovered that they aren't all that fearless. </p> <p>A friend who once worked for Virgin told me how turbulence used to frighten her so badly that she often found herself screaming out loud, much to the alarm of nearby passengers. She resigned after a particularly bumpy transatlantic flight. A senior BA purser I came across said that he was fine to begin with, but that after almost a decade he couldn't cope with it any more unless he took a Valium. And, in the course of my research, I heard numerous other tales of drug and alcohol dependency among cabin crew, of people locking themselves in the crew rest area, of people not going to work at all because flying suddenly scared the wits out of them. </p> <p>In the course of my research, I managed a number of flights (specifically eight - four return trips to New York, which is the route in my book) without resorting to my usual cocktail of beer and beta-blockers, by convincing myself that because I was writing a novel set on a plane it would be too extraordinary for me to die in a plane crash. I felt I was somehow invincible - which, if nothing else, illustrates how phobias can really twist your mind, your rationality. At least I was able to concentrate on my surroundings, trying to observe everything in the name of research, rather than worry about a bomb going off in the cargo hold, or the chances of being in a midair collision. </p> <p>In the past, I hadn't even been able to look out of the window and always asked for an aisle seat, then I'd cower behind newspapers and magazines. Now, I'd stare at the cloud formations, the sun dipping behind a cresting wave of stratocumulus, and think, yeah, actually this is pretty beautiful. I'd listen to the steady, almost reassuring trilling of the engines, rather than turn up the volume on my headset. I'd no longer fight the sense of motion, but let my body relax into the seat (as much as that's ever possible). </p> <p>It was amazing, too, watching the cabin crew scuttling up and down the aisles, dealing with demanding passengers, handing out the hot meals (or \"hots\", as they say in the business), and every so often checking that their hair was in place. I suppose what slowly struck me - and this was after I had ventured into numerous galleys for a gossip - was the fact that they weren't some alien species. They were just like you and me - certainly me, in the way they worried about their relationships and their social lives, about their job security and who was bitching about them behind their back. Except everything seemed to be so condensed. It was as if they were operating on fast-forward. They weren't just suddenly overfamiliar with each other; they had affairs and bust-ups on one-night stopovers that would have taken months to materialise in normal jobs. Taking all this in suddenly seemed much more interesting than worrying about the plane crashing. </p> <p>So when I turned up for the fear-of-flying course - which I had booked months beforehand - I was feeling surprisingly confident thanks to this whole new agenda my phobia had provoked and the knowledge (both social and technical) that I had already gained through my research. In many ways, I felt that I had largely overcome my fear of flying, or at least had learned to cope with it. I honestly believed that the BA-approved course would be a breeze, that I might come top of the class. </p> <p>What I did not realise was that most people who are seriously afraid of flying know an enormous amount about it. There were people attending (about 150 in all, and a pretty even mix between men and women) who recalled crashes I'd never heard of, people who could describe the workings of a modern aircraft just as competently as the smooth-talking pilots taking the course. And whenever one of the course instructors said some flight system or particular control was infallible - bound by what is known in the industry as in-built redundancy - there was always someone who could successfully contradict him. </p> <p>\"Turbulence is not comfortable,\" we were told to recite, \"but it is not dangerous.\" Which, sadly, isn't quite true, someone pointed out - a number of passengers have apparently died in midair due to severe turbulence. And planes aren't immune to lightning strikes, either - in 1976, an Iranian jumbo jet was reported to have exploded after being struck just outside Madrid. </p> <p>My early confidence quickly subsided - the gloomy surroundings of the bland Heathrow airport hotel, where the course was being held, didn't help. I had clearly been kidding myself that I had somehow got over my fear of flying. In fact, what I had probably been doing was just hiding it, or, I suppose, smothering it behind the whole idea of my novel. As we moved on from the technical aspects of the course to the mental issues, it became increasingly apparent that I had been ignoring the issue of phobias and, more important, what really lies behind them (and concentrating on cabin crew gossip instead). It transpires that people afflicted with a fear of flying roughly divide into two groups. There are those whose fear comes from unfamiliarity with the experience and those who, for whatever reason, have developed a phobia. The first lot are easy enough to treat. It's the second lot, people like me, who are the problem. </p> <p>The psychotherapists, who came along for the afternoon, tried, much as my doctor had, to suggest that it is ourselves who are making us anxious and not the aircraft. They said that very often fear is self-administered and that we simply allow our imaginations to play tricks on us. However, they didn't go much beyond telling us to think of pleasant thoughts - ie, to indulge in a bit of positive thinking, which, to a degree, I had already started to do. Mind you, I can't blame them for not expanding further on the issue - it probably would have taken them a few years to sort us lot out, not an afternoon. One of them said something, however, shortly before we were to board the plane for our \"test\" flight, that took me right back to the Geneva incident. </p> <p>\"Remember,\" this patient, soft-voiced, middle-aged woman said, \"anxiety breeds anxiety.\" The time my plane was struck by lightning just so happened to coincide with a great change in my life. I had recently become engaged, accepted a new job, put my flat on the market, sold my first novel, and, I suddenly recalled, been mugged. I'm now certain that the shock of the lightning strike had somehow jumbled all this up in my mind. </p> <p>All my anxiety about having been mugged, and concern over whether my first novel, new job and quite possibly impending marriage would all be the huge success I hoped them to be, shifted on to the very tangible experience of flying. What was suddenly so good about life became confused because of a traumatic experience. </p> <p>I'm not sure how effective the course was in getting me to recognise this, or whether I was moving, albeit slowly, in that direction (or maybe even the opposite direction), anyway. I'm not sure that you could say I was your normal fear-of-flying candidate, being a novelist and perhaps particularly susceptible to neuroses and heightened levels of anxiety. Though from the people I met on the course (and while researching my novel), I reckon a phobia about flying can hit anyone, even an air steward. It took me a long while - almost three years - to recognise all this, and also the very obvious and related fact that flying is about letting go or, rather, relinquishing control (unless you happen to be the pilot). </p> <p>In a way, I see overcoming my phobia - or at least beginning to understand what lay behind it - as a sign of growing up, as a sign of finally accepting that the world doesn't just revolve around me. However, part of me can't help feeling increasingly queasy about having now actually written this novel set on a plane - a novel, as it has turned out, about not just flying but also about relationships and commitment, desire and anxiety. </p> <p>I haven't flown since publication day, because I am worried that I might just be tempting fate once again. The one, probably very obvious, question that I can't recall being asked on the course, was: \"What do you do if the phobia returns?\" As with alcoholism, or any form of addiction, do you ever really get over a fear of flying? </p> <p>\u0095 Henry Sutton is the author of Flying, published by Sceptre, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have just one certificate stuck to the cork board above my desk, but what I did to get it is something I'm particularly proud of, and also a little embarrassed about. It certifies that I successfully completed a flight aboard a British Airways aircraft - there is even a photograph of the very plane, a Boeing 757, way above the white cliffs of Dover. When I look at this picture, I often wonder how I got through this flight. Perhaps I should have made a lunge for the emergency exit and bailed out. Or kicked and screamed until the pilot turned back. You see, I did once get off an aircraft shortly before it taxied to the runway. That was a couple of years before I undertook the fear-of-flying course; a couple of years during which I steadily lost touch with reality. Fear of flying is totally irrational, or so I've been told countless times, but when you experience it, it seems the most logical thing in the world. And it can take your breath away, literally, because it's not just a mental condition; it has powerful physical symptoms, too. What might at first seem to be a dull ache in your stomach quickly spreads throughout your body, so you hurt all over. Meanwhile, your heart rate begins to shoot up, along with your blood pressure, and you start to sweat profusely. You become nauseous. And everything appears to close in around you. You feel as if you are about to implode. You don't exactly feel rigid with fear, more you just feel totally crushed by it. The symptoms first manifested themselves on a Swissair Airbus that was about to depart Geneva for London Heathrow. They were so bad that neither the cabin crew, or even my uncle with whom I was travelling, could have persuaded me to stay on board. Perspiring and shaking wildly, I finally stood up, grabbed my hand luggage, muttered something to my uncle about taking the train, and stumbled for the exit. I didn't look back. I was allowed to get off because the plane had been delayed for more than an hour-and-a-half due to a \"technical problem\", and a few other businessmen sitting in the front of the plane were also getting off, though clearly for very different reasons. Had there not been a \"technical problem\", I'm pretty sure I would have completed this flight, albeit very nervously. As it was, the longer we sat on the Tarmac, with men in overalls wandering on board every so often, the more anxious I became. In fact, at one point the plane actually pushed back from the stand and was heading for the runway, engines roaring, or, rather, sort of whining, only to return a number of minutes later. The pilot eventually explained that a computer would have to be changed, although this was a pretty quick operation and we would be off shortly. I, however, couldn't help thinking that it would be a lot easier to get off - after a while, I couldn't bare to look at what was going on (in retrospect, I think this was because I didn't want to witness an engineer making a mistake, not that I would have known what that would have looked like). With each new setback, I was more convinced that this plane was never going to make it to London and that it was going to crash, that we were all going to die, gruesomely - my anxiety and the corresponding physical symptoms spiralling ever more out of control. The source of my phobia was a Swissair Airbus (for all I know, it might have been the very same) leaving Geneva for London almost one year earlier. Everything was going smoothly that day. There were no delays, the evening sky appeared clear - a beautiful, deep mauve colour with a few snowy peaks just visible. Travelling for work, I happened to be sitting in the business section and was more concerned with the newspaper I had been handed than anything that was going on around me. We took off right on schedule - that I remember, as I was eager to get back in time for dinner with my fianc\u00e9e. A few seconds later, just as we were at what seemed to be the steepest (and slowest) point of the climb, there was a huge bang, an explosive bang. An electric-blue flash shot through the cabin, along the side walls and aisle, the overhead lockers and right under my feet. A number of people screamed, though not at the front of the plane, not in business class. Then there was this eerie silence. No one even rustled their paper as we waited for the plane to start tumbling back to earth. My first thought was, wow, I'm going to die in a plane crash. Me. Why me? And why now? I had just got engaged. I had recently sold my first novel. I had a terrific new job. For about the first time in my life everything was going right. Then wham. But instead of plunging to earth, the plane kept on climbing. Up in the plush business section, we started to look at one another quizzically. After what seemed like for ever, but what must have been four or five minutes, the pilot came on the PA to say that the plane had been hit by lightning but there was nothing to worry about. They had run a number of checks and we were to continue to London Heathrow, where we were still expected to land on time. Over the next year I flew a great deal - I had little option. My \"terrific\" new job was in fact travel editor of an international newspaper. Refusing to accept that I had suddenly become afraid of flying - I never talked about the lightning strike - I found myself drinking more and more heavily before I got on a plane. And then I started making up all sorts of excuses to get out of going on trips, particularly those involving developing countries or eastern European airlines, or airlines that used Airbuses. I'd ring ahead to check. Looking back, I see that I turned down Brazil, Mexico, Morocco twice, Budapest and Prague. As well as the alcohol, I also began consuming handfuls of beta-blockers that my doctor had prescribed for me. Beta-blockers are meant to help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, and with those out of the way, without your heart pumping like mad, it's supposedly easier to think about something other than your anxiety - though I think that I found the drink more effective. When I went to New York on Concorde, I consumed so much Dom P\u00e9rignon 1985 Mo\u00ebt &amp; Chandon that we could have left the stratosphere completely and zoomed off into space for all I would have known. Then I tried to go everywhere on Eurostar, and despite on one occasion being stuck in the tunnel for four hours (three of which were in darkness), I still vastly preferred the experience to flying. It simply didn't set my mind racing with so many catastrophic thoughts. Yet why I let myself in for another Geneva hop, on Swissair, almost exactly a year after I thought I was going to be in a fatal crash, I still can't quite explain - perhaps I was testing myself. However, once on the Tarmac, in this Airbus that obviously had a serious technical problem, I knew I wouldn't be so lucky a second time - I had already been warned. My fate was sealed. Suddenly flying didn't just frighten me; I had developed a phobia about it. All rationality had gone out of the window. Why would Swissair, an airline with one of the best safety records in the world, allow a dodgy plane to take off? Of course, I knew that nothing would happen to the plane - I left my uncle on it, after all - just as I knew flying was one of the safest forms of travel. Still, I was glad I got off that plane. I remember walking through the terminal building, heading for the train, feeling a huge weight had lifted. I suppose in succumbing to my anxiety, my phobia, I at least recognised that I had a problem. For a while I let things get really out of hand. I read everything I could find about planes and their safety records. Regardless of the statistics, I would always come to the conclusion that none of them was that safe. There was always a crash somewhere to prove my point, or suddenly a plane with an impeccable safety record, such as the Concorde, would fall appallingly out of the sky. I pored over articles on specific crashes - the Valujet DC-9 that slammed into a Florida swamp, the TWA Boeing 747 that blew up in midair just out of JFK, the Swissair MD11 that came down in Nova Scotia, the Romanian A310 that barely had time to become airborne after leaving Bucharest airport. I read somewhere that all the pathologist had to identify the pilot of a Boeing 737 (the most popular commercial jet in the world) that crashed in Pittsburgh was the sole of his foot, a slither of charred flesh. A friend, who works for a big City bank, passed me an internal report that graded airlines by their safety records so its employees could decide which they would feel happiest flying with. I can tell you that at the bottom of this listwas Macedonian Airlines, closely followed by Azerbaijan Airlines, Kazakhstan Airlines and Orbi Georgian Airlines - not, of course, that I had ever flown with any of these. A short while later, the same friend (friend?) passed me some information that I thought at the time proved my phobia wasn't quite so irrational, that I'd been on the right track all along. It included the terrifying fact that cars are actually 12 times safer than planes and that, of all modes of transport, only motorbikes are more dangerous. This statistic was arrived at by calculating the number of trips taken, as opposed to the norm of looking at the deaths per distances travelled. Even, apparently, if you measure the fatality rate per man-hour of exposure to a particular form of transport, cars and planes come out pretty evenly. Gradually, I became aware of not just how common my condition was, but that I wasn't the only travel writer who was afraid of flying. Aside from numerous tales of head-banging turbulence and engine fires, aborted takeoffs and undercarriage failures, many of my former colleagues feared that because they flew so much, by the law of averages one day their time would be up. But regardless of all this, and irrespective of how you skew the figures (and even if there has just been a terrible crash - you can usually find at least one major incident in the world in any given month), flying is remarkably safe, and getting safer. The overall accident rate per flight stands at one in a million, well down from 50 in a million in the 60s. Yet, to the phobic mind, these figures are meaningless - the plane you are on is going to crash, and nothing anyone says can distract you from that thought. I like to think that I eventually left my travel editor job for other reasons (to concentrate on my novel-writing, say, and to spend more time with my new wife), but it is conceivable that my fear of flying played a considerable part. With my feet planted firmly on the ground, I began to question why flying affects so many people in such a negative way (some say up to half the adult population fear it) - why exactly it generates all this anxiety. I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane without my palms becoming clammy and this heaving sensation starting up in my chest. In fact, I wondered whether I would ever be able to get on a plane again. Why was I being so bloody irrational about it? I just couldn't get my mind to accept the reality of the situation - that I wasn't going to die every time I stepped on to a plane, even if it were to be involved in an incident. Planes are obviously well built enough to withstand lightning strikes, as well as all sorts of mechanical and systems failures. I then started to think about the nature of phobias.

I felt I was somehow invincible - which, if nothing else, illustrates how phobias can really twist your mind, your rationality.

For at least a decade now, British critics have genuflected - in their own version of what Australians call the \"cultural cringe\" - towards American writing.

It was commented at the time that the same might happen with the Booker were it not for the precaution of excluding American novelists.

      "bodyText": "A typical critic's line on the Booker prize since the 80s has been the way in which its shortlists - thronging with novelists from Ireland, India, Sri Lanka, Canada and New Zealand - represented the revenge of the former colonies against the mother tongue. A similar argument has informed much recent cricket-writing. But on the bookshelves - if not yet in the Test match arena - the biggest current winner is a colony lost longer ago: America. For at least a decade now, British critics have genuflected - in their own version of what Australians call the \"cultural cringe\" - towards American writing. Authors from the US had bigger stories, a zappier language, more political relevance. Such bleats have become routine. The new twist in the cringe, however, has been American fiction's assault on our literary prizes: even those designed to keep them out. The fiction shortlist for the leading crime-writing prize, the Macallan Daggers, includes only one British author among the contending six. It was commented at the time that the same might happen with the Booker were it not for the precaution of excluding American novelists. And yet, despite the patriotic firewall inserted in the rules, the Booker 2000 shortlist, announced on Thursday, is arguably - and we are about to have that argument - 50% American.

      "body": "<p>\"Picasso's Weeping Woman!\" For years, this epithet has followed every mention of Dora Maar, as if tears were her only significant characteristic. Or, more sympathetically: \"The trajectory of Dora Maar, in life as in photography, seems that of a meteorite which came too near the sun ...\" Maar's later years, lived as a recluse, further fixed her as a victim. She was said to have suffered \"a nervous breakdown nearly of madhouse gravity and to be living in seclusion\". Her life was not so different from such portrayals, but they are far from telling the whole story. </p> <p>Henriette Theodora Markovitch (her full name) was born in Paris on November 22, 1907. She was the only daughter of a Croatian architect, Joseph Markovitch. By some accounts he was Jewish, though Dora Maar denied that in her later life. Her mother was a French Catholic from Tours, n\u00e9e Julie Voisin. When Theodora was three years old, the family left for Buenos Aires. Her father had secure commissions for several important buildings there, including the Austro-Hungarian Embassy, for which the Emperor Franz Josef gave him a decoration. Yet Dora told James Lord, the American art critic and friend of long standing, that her father must have been \"the only architect who failed to make a fortune in Buenos Aires\". She confided in Lord about the strife between her parents, and the lack of privacy she suffered during childhood. Her room had a glass door covered by a curtain to the outside, so that she could be spied on at any time and could never be entirely alone. </p> <p>At school in Argentina, Theodora spoke both Spanish and French fluently, and read widely in English. Like many left-handed children of her time, she was made to write, eat and conduct her normal affairs with her right hand. However, she drew and painted with her left hand her whole life long. This may go some way towards explaining the occasional awkwardness of her paintings. </p> <p>In 1926, when she was 19, her family moved back to Paris. Theodora took up studies at a photography school before entering the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where women were able to receive the same training as male students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. It was in this period she shortened her name to Dora Maar. She divided her time between painting and photography, until she began to receive far more encouragement for her photography and decided to pursue that full time. Yet when Picasso belittled her photographic talents and urged her to resume painting instead, she was to acquiesce. </p> <p>Her photographs of this early period have something almost Expressionist about them, a taste for high drama, along with something more troubling. Her innate sense of humour, on which all her friends have commented, has a macabre edge: in a humorous yet not so humorous pose with a skeleton, a self-portrait or student collaboration, Dora is smiling into the face of a skull. The inscription reads: \"There you are again, my love! Dora Markovitch.\" The photograph, a confrontation of life and death recalling a vanitas painting - a woman before her mirror, a table gleaming with delights, and a memento mori in a timepiece or a skull - is a clear indication that Dora Maar was already in possession of the techniques and temperament befitting a Surrealist artist. She was undaunted by extremes. </p> <p>By 1929, just as Dora Maar was embarking on her career, the New Photography - with its emphasis on directness of vision, on materials, and on the beauty of everyday and mundane objects - was at its height in France. Brassa\u00ef recollected Dora Maar in these early days in her long white coat, a true professional already, stalking about her subject as a huntress around her prey as she searched for the most telling detail. </p> <p>Her images of street life in Barcelona, Paris and London, of the poverty-stricken, the lame, the blind and the down-and-out, mark clearly her interest, personal, artistic and political. The rise of fascism in Europe in these years was a great spur and cohesive force to the French Left. Dora Maar was very involved with activist groups such as Appel \u00e0 la lutte (Call to the Struggle), whose manifesto she and her former lover Louis Chavance, the film-maker, signed on February 10, 1934: </p> <p>'There's not a moment to lose <br>Unity of action <br>Call for a general strike!' </p> <p>In late 1935, Dora Maar was set photographer on Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, directed by Jean Renoir, and it was on the film set that Paul Eluard first introduced her to Pablo Picasso. Fifty-four years old, he was most likely dressed, as he usually was, in his \"worn old suit with its sagging pockets and baggy trousers, odd waistcoats worn over one or two sweaters and shirts with bent or crumpled collars ...\", his Basque beret and long scarf, his keys fastened to his belt, his money fastened inside his jacket with a safety pin. By 1935 he was estranged from his first wife Olga Kokhlova and recently fathered a daughter, Maya, by Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. He was to remain in close touch with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se throughout his involvement with Dora; she was to be the private lover, Dora the public. </p> <p>Dora vividly remembered their brief meeting on set; he did not. It would take a much more dramatic encounter for this startling young woman to catch his eye. The erotic, the exaggerated and the elegant are interwoven in all the accounts of Maar's meeting with Picasso in early 1936. Here is Jean-Paul Crespelle's version of the tale. Picasso is with his friend Paul Eluard at the Caf\u00e9 des Deux Magots, where he notices Dora at a neighbouring table, \"the young woman's serious face, lit up by pale blue eyes which looked all the paler because of her thick eyebrows; a sensitive uneasy face, with light and shade passing alternately over it. She kept driving a small pointed penknife between her fingers into the wood of the table. Sometimes she missed and a drop of blood appeared between the roses embroidered on her black gloves ... Picasso would ask Dora to give him the gloves and would lock them up in the showcase he kept for his mementos.\" </p> <p>Asking Eluard to introduce them, Picasso addressed Dora in French, which he assumed to be her language; she replied in Spanish, which she knew to be his. The three main ingredients of the encounter - her knife, her fingers and her gloves - are like the elements of a Surrealist still life. They also have a fetishistic value. As it is recounted and re-recounted, the incident feels like a blood sport or a bullfight. Picasso was fascinated by Dora's gratuitous act of self-mutilation, playing with a knife as one would with fire. His attraction to danger was a marked element in his being. It would be expressed in the torturous imagery with which he surrounded some of his images of Dora - uncomfortable chairs, angles sharp as blades, insects and spiders and horns. And just as Picasso kept the bloodied glove, Dora Maar treasured a trace of his dried blood among her souvenirs. </p> <p>According to some accounts, Picasso left town immediately after meeting Dora. Whether or not Picasso fled, he and Dora were to meet again. Picasso drove down to the south of France in July with his chauffeur in his Hispano-Suiza car. He joined his friends Paul and Nusch Eluard who were staying at Mougins, a little village above Cannes. The Eluards and Picasso went to Saint-Tropez to visit the writer Lise Deharme, society hostess and part of the Surrealist group. Staying with Deharme was her good friend Dora Maar. Her house was close to the sea, and Picasso, after visiting there, walked back with Dora along the beach to Mougins. In a drawing of August 1, 1936, he showed a young and diminutive Dora, bag in hand, opening a door on to the naked, bearded patriarch, a dog on his lap. The hierarchy is strongly marked: the newcomer and the priapic old painter. </p> <p>The numerous paintings and drawings Picasso made of Dora Maar in this period show her as a being constantly in transformation: she becomes a bird, a water nymph, she takes on horns or then the features of flowers. Each day the group of friends would dip in the sea, sun on the sand, prepare and consume their simple food, talk politics over the meal, and play cards in their spare moments in the afternoon. After lunch, they would all take a nap - all but Picasso, who was always working at his art. </p> <p>Back in Paris in early 1937, Picasso moved, at Dora Maar's suggestion, into a new studio at 7 rue des Grands Augustins. This attic at the top of an elegant 17th-century mansion was well known to her: it had previously been occupied by the actor Jean-Louis Barrault, and she had frequented it along with other members of the October Group, a radical collective of writers and actors. Once home to the Dukes of Savoy, the building was all the more picturesque for being the fictional location of Balzac's Le Chef d'oeuvre inconnu (The Unknown Masterpiece). </p> <p>According to Jean Cocteau, who was devoted to Picasso, the atmosphere at the studio was regal: \"A regal disorder, a regal emptiness - haunted by the monsters he invents, who compose his universe.\" Among these monsters was the double-natured Picasso himself: \"Picasso is a man and a woman deeply entwined. Like in his paintings. He's a living m\u00e9nage. The Picasso m\u00e9nage. Dora is a concubine with whom he is unfaithful to himself. From this m\u00e9nage marvellous monsters are born.\" </p> <p>Dora moved to an apartment at 6 rue de Savoie, just around the corner from the rue des Grands Augustins. Even so, she was never welcome in Picasso's studio unless invited. Nor did she ever live with Picasso in his apartment at 23 rue la Bo\u00e9tie. Years later, walking with Cocteau past 6 rue de Savoie, Picasso commented: \"In this house, Dora Maar died of boredom.\" </p> <p>In July 1936, General Franco had led a revolt against Spain's democratic government that led to the outbreak of civil war. The following year rightwing Spanish rebels took M\u00e1laga, Picasso's birthplace, with Italian aid, and Franco began a naval blockade. On Sunday April 26, 1937, the defenceless Basque town of Guernica was devastated in a bombing attack by the German Condor Squadron. </p> <p>That terrible event would receive its immortal image at the studio at 7 rue des Grands Augustins. Picasso had been approached at the beginning of the year by the Spanish Republican government to paint a mural for the Spanish Pavilion in the Universal Exposition, due to open in Paris in May. He had agreed, but until now his sketches had been conventional and uninspired. The atrocity of Guernica gave him his theme. </p> <p>Maar, whose dismay at the continuing rise of fascism was intense after years of involvement with the left, was the perfect photographer to capture the evolution of his painting. Brassa\u00ef, who had followed Picasso's work closely with his camera in the past, now stepped aside. During the Spanish civil war it was Dora Maar who was Picasso's photographic witness and collaborator. She even painted some of the vertical strokes on the horse of Guernica, a minor but symbolic contribution. The huge mural - nearly eight metres wide - was completed in little more than a month. </p> <p>Picasso famously said of this work: \"Painting is not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war ... against brutality and darkness.\" He introduced Dora Maar's features into Guernica in the woman holding up a lamp, but also the memory of the woman with the lantern in his Minotaur series, based on Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. It is ironic but fitting that Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Dora came into confrontation during the work's creation. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se entered the studio one day, and began to insist that Dora leave. Fran\u00e7oise Gilot recorded the story, as recounted by Picasso: </p> <p>\"I have a child by this man. It's my place to be here with him,\" said Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. \"You can leave right now.\" Dora said, \"I have as much reason as you have to be here. I haven't borne him a child but I don't see what difference that makes.\" </p> <p>Picasso kept on painting, he told Fran\u00e7oise, while they kept on arguing. \"Finally, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se turned to me and said, 'Make up your mind. Which one of us goes?' It was a hard decision to make. I liked them both, for different reasons: Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se because she was sweet and gentle and did whatever I wanted her to, and Dora because she was intelligent ... I told them they'd have to fight it out themselves. So they began to wrestle.\" </p> <p>Picasso summed up the incident as \"one of my choicest memories\". </p> <p>Between 1936 and 1937, Picasso and Dora collaborated on a collection of photograms, and he painted more and more portraits of her. Many of these paintings convey violence. According to Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, Picasso explained his tortured rendering of Dora as an inevitability. Even though he claimed to have laughed with her more than with anyone else, \"I just couldn't get a portrait of her while she was laughing ... for years I painted her with tortured shapes. This was not because of sadism, but not because of any particular pleasure either. I was simply obeying a profound vision that had imposed itself on me. A profound reality.\" </p> <p>The intensity of feeling vented by Dora Maar's hot-tempered personality leaps out at the viewer from the anguished features of her portraits of these years. Picasso portrayed her again and again as the Weeping Woman in 1937, or entrapped her insect-like image in dense networks of lines. He later told Fran\u00e7oise Gilot that he considered Dora \"a Kafkaesque personality\". Yet the portraits of this period are not all anguished. Roland Penrose picks up the brilliant colours in Dora Maar Seated of 1937, \"which joyously convey the radiance of her youth\". It is unfortunate, if inevitable, that the subsequent storms in their relationship and her life have so often been read back into the tormented portraits of these years. For besides turning her powerful features into an equally powerful lament against the cruelty of war, Picasso expressed in them optimism, energy and tenderness. </p> <p>Another reason for refusing the reduction of Dora Maar's memory to \"the Weeping Woman\" is the crucial fact that she drew upon her lover's imagery in her own representations of his work. This says a great deal about her strength. Her recovery of her image, the agency of her own art, have not been taken as seriously as they deserve. She was not simply \"imitating\" Picasso, as has been said: she was too intelligent for that. Nor is she \"imitating\" his portraits of her. She is collaborating in their representation of this tragedy, as she did in photographing his work. </p> <p>After Guernica, Dora Maar returned in September 1937 with Picasso to Mougins, with the Eluards. They were joined by Jacqueline Lamba and Andr\u00e9 Breton, Roland Penrose and Lee Miller, Eileen Agar and her lover Joseph Bard, Man Ray and his mistress Ady, and Christian and Yvonne Zervos: the company was as warm as the Proven\u00e7al sun. In her witty recollections of that period, the Surrealist artist Eileen Agar recounts their practice of exchanging bedmates: \"It was Picasso who first came up with the idea of name-swapping. Eileen Agar became Dora Agar, Pablo Picasso became Don Jos\u00e9 Picasso, Joseph Bard became Pablo Bard, Man Ray became Roland Ray. If you forgot what your name was for that day, you were fined one or two francs.\" Paul Eluard enjoyed offering the beautiful Nusch to others, especially Picasso, who gladly accepted; her point of view has not come down to us. </p> <p>Dora was painting a great deal now, particularly experimental and stylized portraits of her lover and friends. Picasso had urged her to return to painting, announcing, perhaps believing, that in every photographer - including Man Ray himself - there was always a painter eager to be released. </p> <p>On 3 June 1940, German planes bombed the airports of Paris. Picasso and Dora returned there; the frustrations of life under occupation were grave. During these years Picasso continued to work with a frenzy: paintings of Dora in hats and armchairs, busts of Dora and Nusch. </p> <p>In February and March of 1942, Dora Maar wrote this desperate poem, and typed it, scoring out much of the text. It reflects a growing discord between herself and Picasso. Vividly anticipating her own solitude, remaining motionless in her pride, she refuses to ask herself or anyone else for pity: </p> <p>Today it's another landscape in this<br>Sunday at the end<br>of the month of March 1942 in Paris<br>the silence is<br>so great that the songs of the tame <br>birds are like little <br>flames you can see. I am desperate <br>But let it be </p> <p>The political atmosphere remained grim, fuelled by accusations, denunciations and self-justifications. About the Occupation and its effects, Picasso remarked despairingly to Cocteau: \"You'll see. Everything will go from bad to worse. It's all broken in us.\" </p> <p>In July, almost 13,000 Jews were rounded up by French police into the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, a sports arena in Paris. From there they were taken to the concentration camp at Drancy in north-eastern Paris. In December, Hitler gave the order for all French Jews to be deported. Dora's Jewish parentage, if true, was overlooked, and no one gave her or her father away; nevertheless the fear and claustrophobia of this time must have been overwhelming. </p> <p>The relationship between Picasso and Dora Maar was by now under severe strain. In May 1943, while dining at the Catalan restaurant, Picasso met Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, 20 years younger than Dora and 40 years younger than him. She was tall, slender, beautiful. Dora's state of mind became increasingly unstable as her jealousy mounted. Dora had shared Picasso with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and their daughter Maya for years, a sharing that was never simple. He would insinuate that she was unfeminine, that her sterility - rarely spoken of, but possibly an element in her complicated personality - was the opposite of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's gentle and curvaceous fertility. In his portraits, Picasso would sometimes deliberately confuse their representation, crowning Dora with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's flowers, or dressing Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in a costume more fitting for Dora. He also painted them together, in a double portrait. Early in his affair with Fran\u00e7oise he told her that \"for me, there are only two kinds of women - goddesses and doormats\". </p> <p>Dora Maar had by now given up photography. Perhaps her renewed enthusiasm for painting came about through painting those few strokes in Guernica; perhaps her proximity to a painter of genius inspired her anew. All the same, her submission to what seems to have been Picasso's wish demonstrates a great sacrifice of her talent and her individuality. She was intensely conscious of this, once saying about their relationship, \"I wasn't Picasso's mistress, he was just my master.\" </p> <p>One positive effect of her renunciation of photography was the renewal of her friendship with that other photographer of genius, Brassa\u00ef: \"Professional jealousy shaken off, there was no longer any obstacle to our friendship ...\" When Dora Maar's still lifes were exhibited in 1944, Brass\u00e4i insisted that one fact deserved underlining: \"She has managed to keep herself free of Picasso's formidable influence. Her still lifes - a loaf of bread, a pitcher or a jug - are extremely austere and recall nothing of her friend's colours or any of the periods of his work.\" Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, herself a painter, considered that Maar excelled in a chiaroscuro that was missing in Picasso's work, and in the painting of ordinary objects: \"Lamp or an alarm clock or a piece of bread ... [they] made you feel she wasn't so much interested in them as their solitude, the terrible solitude and void that surrounded everything in that penumbra.\" </p> <p>In December 1944, James Lord first sought out Picasso, hoping for a portrait of himself. He met Dora at lunch. She held out a gloved hand, pride and stylish accoutrements intact. Her gaze, says Lord, \"possessed remarkable radiance but could also be very hard. I observed that she was beautiful, with a strong, straight nose, perfect scarlet lips, the chin firm, the jaw a trifle heavy and the more forceful for being so, rich chestnut hair drawn smoothly back, and eyelashes like the furred antennae of moths.\" Before lighting her Gauloise, taken from Picasso's blue packet, she took out her gold cigarette holder, \"a slender tube several inches long like a tiny trumpet, with a black Bakelite mouthpiece and a flaring bell, into which she studiedly inserted the end of her cigarette. She had remarkably beautiful hands, the fingers exceptionally slender and graceful, with long, pointed, scarlet nails. Having set the cigarette into its holder, she placed the mouthpiece between her teeth and must have clenched them, because the holder jutted upward at an acute angle from her lips. Then she sat there, staring straight in front of her, moving not a muscle with the unlighted cigarette projecting into space.\" Picasso asked for a cigarette lighter; she answered that it must have been lost. Picasso shouted at her in Spanish and rapped his knuckles on the table loudly. \"But he appeared supremely indifferent to everyone but Dora, whose own indifference to Picasso's tirade was evidently absolute, as she simply sat there, the unlit cigarette immobile in front of her face.\" </p> <p>Picasso and Dora continued to see each other until 1946, but by then a final separation was inevitable. Friends had warned Dora that she should protect herself against Picasso, the satanic genius, her \"demon lover\", as people called him; but she had her pride, her stubbornness and her originality. There was now another terrible loss. On November 28, 1946, just after she and Nusch Eluard had been talking on the phone and making plans to meet for lunch while Paul Eluard was away in Switzerland, Nusch suddenly collapsed with a fatal cerebral haemorrhage. To Dora, it must have seemed that she was losing everyone she loved at the same time. </p> <p>During this sad period, Picasso and Fran\u00e7oise Gilot chanced upon Dora at an exhibition of the Unicorn tapestries, and they all went to lunch together at the restaurant Chez Francis. As Gilot tells the story, Dora ordered caviar: \"You don't mind if I order the most expensive thing on the menu, do you?\" she said. \"I suppose I still have the right to a little luxury, for the time being?\" Picasso insisted on telling her all about how marvellous Fran\u00e7oise was: \"What a mind! I've really discovered somebody, haven't I?\" Dora conversed in a witty fashion, but Picasso never laughed at her remarks at all, saving his hearty laughter for Fran\u00e7oise. </p> <p>Some time after that, Picasso ran into Dora again, this time at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore. He invited himself and Fran\u00e7oise to Dora's studio to see her paintings, and forced Dora to tell Fran\u00e7oise that it was all over between them. Fran\u00e7oise recalled that \"Dora Maar looked over at me briefly and witheringly. It was true; there was no longer anything between Pablo and her, she said, and I certainly shouldn't worry about being the cause of their breakup. That was about as preposterous an assumption as she could imagine.\" Dora then ventured that their affair wouldn't last, that Fran\u00e7oise would be \"out on the ash-heap before three months had passed\". Dora turned to Picasso: \"You've never loved anyone in your life. You don't know how to love.\" </p> <p>Tales of Dora's strange comportment in this period abound: she claimed to have been attacked and to have had her bicycle stolen, when in fact it was where she had left it, by the Seine. The same act was played out over other possessions. She was discovered naked on her stairs, and had to be ejected from a cinema where she was making a disturbance. She would force Eluard and Picasso to their knees and accuse them of leading sinful lives, insisting that they confess. </p> <p>She suffered a nervous breakdown. She was taken to a psychiatric hospital, where for three weeks she was subjected to a series of electric-shock treatments, and was then moved to a private clinic at the intervention of the psychiatrist Jacques Lacan, called upon by his close friend Paul Eluard. Picasso blamed Dora's breakdown not on his abandonment of her but on her association with the Surrealists, those irrational eccentrics. Just look how they ended, he said to Fran\u00e7oise: Jacques Vach\u00e9, Jacques Rigaut, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, all suicides; Antonin Artaud, completely mad. And, added Picasso, she had always been crazy. </p> <p>Dora underwent two years of analysis with Lacan. Little by little, she regained her poise and composure. According to Picasso, Lacan found himself forced to decide whether to leave Dora to her madness (and an eventual straitjacket) or to encourage in her a mystical tendency that was already apparent. He chose the latter, which, after a phase of occult belief and then a Buddhist period, placed her in the arms of the Roman Catholic Church. This did not, however, launch her immediately into a solitary life. Once past the worst of her private grief, there ensued a worldly period in which Maar became once more part of the sophisticated circuit. </p> <p>Georges Bernier was the editor of the art journal L'Oeil and had known Dora Maar since she was a young woman. \"Lacan had taken care of her, once more Dora was lively, playful. There was absolutely nothing of 'the weeping woman' about her. She lived a dizzying social life, went out a great deal with the Vicomtesse de Noailles and Lise Deharme, picked up with her old friends again.\" </p> <p>She had not, of course, forgotten Picasso. And even 10 years after they had separated, he never ceased in his attempts to humiliate her. In 1958, when he gave the critic and collector Douglas Cooper permission to produce a facsimile edition of a 1906 sketchbook, Picasso suggested he also look at a Facteur Cheval sketchbook that was in Dora's possession. Dora was initially reluctant to show the notebook. When she did, tearfully and only at Picasso's insistence, it turned out to contain close-up drawings of her crotch. </p> <p>For many years the former lovers maintained an unlikely exchange of gifts, whose meanings we can surmise. In 1954, Picasso sent Dora an elaborately packaged chair made of steel rods and coarse rope; it was both ungainly and uncomfortable. \"Isn't it the ugliest thing anybody ever saw!\" Picasso later exclaimed. Dora in return sent Picasso a rusty shovel blade, with which he was apparently rather impressed: \"Yes. Adorable Dora,\" he said. \"She would have had to select something just right.\" </p> <p>There was another gift, never sent. While rummaging through Picasso's belongings in 1983, a doctor from Canada found a small parcel wrapped in tissue paper with \"pour Dora Maar\" written on it. He wrote to her at the rue de Savoie many times to see when he could deliver this, but had no response. Finally, he unwrapped the parcel himself and found in it a small silver ring, \"resembling a flat signet ring with the engraved initials P-D [Pour Dora (for Dora)], but to my absolute amazement and horror, I found attached on the inside of the signet a large SPIKE! Thus it was absolutely impossible for anyone to wear it! I thanked my lucky stars for her refusing to accept this 'gift' from Picasso ...\" </p> <p>By the late 1950s Dora was living between her Paris apartment and her house in M\u00e9nerbes, where she spent the summers. In Provence, she painted still lifes and land scapes, and made some detailed drawings of the countryside, its trees and lanes and vines, its houses and its hills. Her still lifes were as stark as the Proven\u00e7al landscape. Shecontinued to concentrate on the pure object with the simplest backdrop, as she had done in her early photography. Now her focus was twofold: on her religious meditation and on her art. She had always loved Provence. Some of her photographs of the 1930s had captured perfectly the harshness of the raking light and the dry, often barren landscape of the hills. This terrain was a fitting backdrop for her later life as a recluse. </p> <p>Dora Maar was devout to the end. In M\u00e9nerbes, if the Mass was not being said in the local church, she would ask to be driven to nearby Notre-Dame-des-Lumi\u00e8res. She read widely to the end of her life. Fascinated by the moral problems of Catholicism, she read the novels of Graham Greene, and she even loved to read Spanish books in their English translations, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. </p> <p>She also read auction catalogues to see what prices Picasso's paintings were fetching, for these were what she lived on at the end. She kept many paintings but sold others for large sums. Their value was increased by her ownership, as she well knew, \"and I'll tell you why. Because they're mine. On the walls of a gallery, maybe they're worth only half a million. On the walls of Picasso's mistress, they're worth a premium, the premium of history.\" </p> <p>Dora Maar died on July 16, 1997, at the age of 89. She had outlived Picasso by 24 years. To the end of her life, she treasured all that she had preserved of him. The kitchen was precious because he had stepped inside, the chairs, because he had sat in them. </p> <p>Her poems, kept in a medium-sized notebook end with a sketch headed \"Stage set for a tragedy\". The stage was indeed set, and the drama enacted. But Dora Maar's recuperation through her painting, her photography, and her private poetic record of pain and something beyond it, is not a tragedy, but rather a courageous reclamation of her own life, even in - perhaps especially in - solitude </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Dora Maar With And Without Picasso: A Biography, by Mary Ann Caws, published by Thames &amp; Hudson on October 23, priced \u00a324.95.

      "bodyText": "\"Picasso's Weeping Woman!\" For years, this epithet has followed every mention of Dora Maar, as if tears were her only significant characteristic. Or, more sympathetically: \"The trajectory of Dora Maar, in life as in photography, seems that of a meteorite which came too near the sun ...\" Maar's later years, lived as a recluse, further fixed her as a victim. She was said to have suffered \"a nervous breakdown nearly of madhouse gravity and to be living in seclusion\". Her life was not so different from such portrayals, but they are far from telling the whole story. Henriette Theodora Markovitch (her full name) was born in Paris on November 22, 1907. She was the only daughter of a Croatian architect, Joseph Markovitch. By some accounts he was Jewish, though Dora Maar denied that in her later life. Her mother was a French Catholic from Tours, n\u00e9e Julie Voisin. When Theodora was three years old, the family left for Buenos Aires. Her father had secure commissions for several important buildings there, including the Austro-Hungarian Embassy, for which the Emperor Franz Josef gave him a decoration. Yet Dora told James Lord, the American art critic and friend of long standing, that her father must have been \"the only architect who failed to make a fortune in Buenos Aires\". She confided in Lord about the strife between her parents, and the lack of privacy she suffered during childhood. Her room had a glass door covered by a curtain to the outside, so that she could be spied on at any time and could never be entirely alone. At school in Argentina, Theodora spoke both Spanish and French fluently, and read widely in English. Like many left-handed children of her time, she was made to write, eat and conduct her normal affairs with her right hand. However, she drew and painted with her left hand her whole life long. This may go some way towards explaining the occasional awkwardness of her paintings. In 1926, when she was 19, her family moved back to Paris. Theodora took up studies at a photography school before entering the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where women were able to receive the same training as male students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. It was in this period she shortened her name to Dora Maar. She divided her time between painting and photography, until she began to receive far more encouragement for her photography and decided to pursue that full time. Yet when Picasso belittled her photographic talents and urged her to resume painting instead, she was to acquiesce. Her photographs of this early period have something almost Expressionist about them, a taste for high drama, along with something more troubling. Her innate sense of humour, on which all her friends have commented, has a macabre edge: in a humorous yet not so humorous pose with a skeleton, a self-portrait or student collaboration, Dora is smiling into the face of a skull. The inscription reads: \"There you are again, my love! Dora Markovitch.\" The photograph, a confrontation of life and death recalling a vanitas painting - a woman before her mirror, a table gleaming with delights, and a memento mori in a timepiece or a skull - is a clear indication that Dora Maar was already in possession of the techniques and temperament befitting a Surrealist artist. She was undaunted by extremes. By 1929, just as Dora Maar was embarking on her career, the New Photography - with its emphasis on directness of vision, on materials, and on the beauty of everyday and mundane objects - was at its height in France. Brassa\u00ef recollected Dora Maar in these early days in her long white coat, a true professional already, stalking about her subject as a huntress around her prey as she searched for the most telling detail. Her images of street life in Barcelona, Paris and London, of the poverty-stricken, the lame, the blind and the down-and-out, mark clearly her interest, personal, artistic and political. The rise of fascism in Europe in these years was a great spur and cohesive force to the French Left. Dora Maar was very involved with activist groups such as Appel \u00e0 la lutte (Call to the Struggle), whose manifesto she and her former lover Louis Chavance, the film-maker, signed on February 10, 1934: 'There's not a moment to lose Unity of action Call for a general strike!' In late 1935, Dora Maar was set photographer on Le Crime de Monsieur Lange, directed by Jean Renoir, and it was on the film set that Paul Eluard first introduced her to Pablo Picasso. Fifty-four years old, he was most likely dressed, as he usually was, in his \"worn old suit with its sagging pockets and baggy trousers, odd waistcoats worn over one or two sweaters and shirts with bent or crumpled collars ...\", his Basque beret and long scarf, his keys fastened to his belt, his money fastened inside his jacket with a safety pin. By 1935 he was estranged from his first wife Olga Kokhlova and recently fathered a daughter, Maya, by Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. He was to remain in close touch with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se throughout his involvement with Dora; she was to be the private lover, Dora the public. Dora vividly remembered their brief meeting on set; he did not. It would take a much more dramatic encounter for this startling young woman to catch his eye. The erotic, the exaggerated and the elegant are interwoven in all the accounts of Maar's meeting with Picasso in early 1936. Here is Jean-Paul Crespelle's version of the tale. Picasso is with his friend Paul Eluard at the Caf\u00e9 des Deux Magots, where he notices Dora at a neighbouring table, \"the young woman's serious face, lit up by pale blue eyes which looked all the paler because of her thick eyebrows; a sensitive uneasy face, with light and shade passing alternately over it. She kept driving a small pointed penknife between her fingers into the wood of the table. Sometimes she missed and a drop of blood appeared between the roses embroidered on her black gloves ... Picasso would ask Dora to give him the gloves and would lock them up in the showcase he kept for his mementos.\" Asking Eluard to introduce them, Picasso addressed Dora in French, which he assumed to be her language; she replied in Spanish, which she knew to be his. The three main ingredients of the encounter - her knife, her fingers and her gloves - are like the elements of a Surrealist still life. They also have a fetishistic value. As it is recounted and re-recounted, the incident feels like a blood sport or a bullfight. Picasso was fascinated by Dora's gratuitous act of self-mutilation, playing with a knife as one would with fire. His attraction to danger was a marked element in his being. It would be expressed in the torturous imagery with which he surrounded some of his images of Dora - uncomfortable chairs, angles sharp as blades, insects and spiders and horns. And just as Picasso kept the bloodied glove, Dora Maar treasured a trace of his dried blood among her souvenirs. According to some accounts, Picasso left town immediately after meeting Dora. Whether or not Picasso fled, he and Dora were to meet again. Picasso drove down to the south of France in July with his chauffeur in his Hispano-Suiza car. He joined his friends Paul and Nusch Eluard who were staying at Mougins, a little village above Cannes. The Eluards and Picasso went to Saint-Tropez to visit the writer Lise Deharme, society hostess and part of the Surrealist group. Staying with Deharme was her good friend Dora Maar. Her house was close to the sea, and Picasso, after visiting there, walked back with Dora along the beach to Mougins. In a drawing of August 1, 1936, he showed a young and diminutive Dora, bag in hand, opening a door on to the naked, bearded patriarch, a dog on his lap. The hierarchy is strongly marked: the newcomer and the priapic old painter. The numerous paintings and drawings Picasso made of Dora Maar in this period show her as a being constantly in transformation: she becomes a bird, a water nymph, she takes on horns or then the features of flowers. Each day the group of friends would dip in the sea, sun on the sand, prepare and consume their simple food, talk politics over the meal, and play cards in their spare moments in the afternoon. After lunch, they would all take a nap - all but Picasso, who was always working at his art. Back in Paris in early 1937, Picasso moved, at Dora Maar's suggestion, into a new studio at 7 rue des Grands Augustins. This attic at the top of an elegant 17th-century mansion was well known to her: it had previously been occupied by the actor Jean-Louis Barrault, and she had frequented it along with other members of the October Group, a radical collective of writers and actors. Once home to the Dukes of Savoy, the building was all the more picturesque for being the fictional location of Balzac's Le Chef d'oeuvre inconnu (The Unknown Masterpiece). According to Jean Cocteau, who was devoted to Picasso, the atmosphere at the studio was regal: \"A regal disorder, a regal emptiness - haunted by the monsters he invents, who compose his universe.\" Among these monsters was the double-natured Picasso himself: \"Picasso is a man and a woman deeply entwined. Like in his paintings. He's a living m\u00e9nage. The Picasso m\u00e9nage. Dora is a concubine with whom he is unfaithful to himself. From this m\u00e9nage marvellous monsters are born.\" Dora moved to an apartment at 6 rue de Savoie, just around the corner from the rue des Grands Augustins. Even so, she was never welcome in Picasso's studio unless invited. Nor did she ever live with Picasso in his apartment at 23 rue la Bo\u00e9tie. Years later, walking with Cocteau past 6 rue de Savoie, Picasso commented: \"In this house, Dora Maar died of boredom.\" In July 1936, General Franco had led a revolt against Spain's democratic government that led to the outbreak of civil war. The following year rightwing Spanish rebels took M\u00e1laga, Picasso's birthplace, with Italian aid, and Franco began a naval blockade. On Sunday April 26, 1937, the defenceless Basque town of Guernica was devastated in a bombing attack by the German Condor Squadron. That terrible event would receive its immortal image at the studio at 7 rue des Grands Augustins. Picasso had been approached at the beginning of the year by the Spanish Republican government to paint a mural for the Spanish Pavilion in the Universal Exposition, due to open in Paris in May. He had agreed, but until now his sketches had been conventional and uninspired. The atrocity of Guernica gave him his theme. Maar, whose dismay at the continuing rise of fascism was intense after years of involvement with the left, was the perfect photographer to capture the evolution of his painting. Brassa\u00ef, who had followed Picasso's work closely with his camera in the past, now stepped aside. During the Spanish civil war it was Dora Maar who was Picasso's photographic witness and collaborator. She even painted some of the vertical strokes on the horse of Guernica, a minor but symbolic contribution. The huge mural - nearly eight metres wide - was completed in little more than a month. Picasso famously said of this work: \"Painting is not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war ... against brutality and darkness.\" He introduced Dora Maar's features into Guernica in the woman holding up a lamp, but also the memory of the woman with the lantern in his Minotaur series, based on Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter. It is ironic but fitting that Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Dora came into confrontation during the work's creation. Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se entered the studio one day, and began to insist that Dora leave. Fran\u00e7oise Gilot recorded the story, as recounted by Picasso: \"I have a child by this man. It's my place to be here with him,\" said Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. \"You can leave right now.\" Dora said, \"I have as much reason as you have to be here. I haven't borne him a child but I don't see what difference that makes.\" Picasso kept on painting, he told Fran\u00e7oise, while they kept on arguing. \"Finally, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se turned to me and said, 'Make up your mind. Which one of us goes?' It was a hard decision to make. I liked them both, for different reasons: Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se because she was sweet and gentle and did whatever I wanted her to, and Dora because she was intelligent ... I told them they'd have to fight it out themselves. So they began to wrestle.\" Picasso summed up the incident as \"one of my choicest memories\". Between 1936 and 1937, Picasso and Dora collaborated on a collection of photograms, and he painted more and more portraits of her. Many of these paintings convey violence. According to Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, Picasso explained his tortured rendering of Dora as an inevitability. Even though he claimed to have laughed with her more than with anyone else, \"I just couldn't get a portrait of her while she was laughing ... for years I painted her with tortured shapes. This was not because of sadism, but not because of any particular pleasure either. I was simply obeying a profound vision that had imposed itself on me. A profound reality.\" The intensity of feeling vented by Dora Maar's hot-tempered personality leaps out at the viewer from the anguished features of her portraits of these years. Picasso portrayed her again and again as the Weeping Woman in 1937, or entrapped her insect-like image in dense networks of lines. He later told Fran\u00e7oise Gilot that he considered Dora \"a Kafkaesque personality\". Yet the portraits of this period are not all anguished. Roland Penrose picks up the brilliant colours in Dora Maar Seated of 1937, \"which joyously convey the radiance of her youth\". It is unfortunate, if inevitable, that the subsequent storms in their relationship and her life have so often been read back into the tormented portraits of these years. For besides turning her powerful features into an equally powerful lament against the cruelty of war, Picasso expressed in them optimism, energy and tenderness. Another reason for refusing the reduction of Dora Maar's memory to \"the Weeping Woman\" is the crucial fact that she drew upon her lover's imagery in her own representations of his work. This says a great deal about her strength. Her recovery of her image, the agency of her own art, have not been taken as seriously as they deserve. She was not simply \"imitating\" Picasso, as has been said: she was too intelligent for that. Nor is she \"imitating\" his portraits of her. She is collaborating in their representation of this tragedy, as she did in photographing his work. After Guernica, Dora Maar returned in September 1937 with Picasso to Mougins, with the Eluards. They were joined by Jacqueline Lamba and Andr\u00e9 Breton, Roland Penrose and Lee Miller, Eileen Agar and her lover Joseph Bard, Man Ray and his mistress Ady, and Christian and Yvonne Zervos: the company was as warm as the Proven\u00e7al sun. In her witty recollections of that period, the Surrealist artist Eileen Agar recounts their practice of exchanging bedmates: \"It was Picasso who first came up with the idea of name-swapping. Eileen Agar became Dora Agar, Pablo Picasso became Don Jos\u00e9 Picasso, Joseph Bard became Pablo Bard, Man Ray became Roland Ray. If you forgot what your name was for that day, you were fined one or two francs.\" Paul Eluard enjoyed offering the beautiful Nusch to others, especially Picasso, who gladly accepted; her point of view has not come down to us. Dora was painting a great deal now, particularly experimental and stylized portraits of her lover and friends. Picasso had urged her to return to painting, announcing, perhaps believing, that in every photographer - including Man Ray himself - there was always a painter eager to be released. On 3 June 1940, German planes bombed the airports of Paris. Picasso and Dora returned there; the frustrations of life under occupation were grave. During these years Picasso continued to work with a frenzy: paintings of Dora in hats and armchairs, busts of Dora and Nusch. In February and March of 1942, Dora Maar wrote this desperate poem, and typed it, scoring out much of the text. It reflects a growing discord between herself and Picasso. Vividly anticipating her own solitude, remaining motionless in her pride, she refuses to ask herself or anyone else for pity: Today it's another landscape in this Sunday at the end of the month of March 1942 in Paris the silence is so great that the songs of the tame birds are like little flames you can see. I am desperate But let it be The political atmosphere remained grim, fuelled by accusations, denunciations and self-justifications. About the Occupation and its effects, Picasso remarked despairingly to Cocteau: \"You'll see. Everything will go from bad to worse. It's all broken in us.\" In July, almost 13,000 Jews were rounded up by French police into the V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver, a sports arena in Paris. From there they were taken to the concentration camp at Drancy in north-eastern Paris. In December, Hitler gave the order for all French Jews to be deported. Dora's Jewish parentage, if true, was overlooked, and no one gave her or her father away; nevertheless the fear and claustrophobia of this time must have been overwhelming. The relationship between Picasso and Dora Maar was by now under severe strain. In May 1943, while dining at the Catalan restaurant, Picasso met Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, 20 years younger than Dora and 40 years younger than him. She was tall, slender, beautiful. Dora's state of mind became increasingly unstable as her jealousy mounted. Dora had shared Picasso with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and their daughter Maya for years, a sharing that was never simple. He would insinuate that she was unfeminine, that her sterility - rarely spoken of, but possibly an element in her complicated personality - was the opposite of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's gentle and curvaceous fertility. In his portraits, Picasso would sometimes deliberately confuse their representation, crowning Dora with Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's flowers, or dressing Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in a costume more fitting for Dora. He also painted them together, in a double portrait. Early in his affair with Fran\u00e7oise he told her that \"for me, there are only two kinds of women - goddesses and doormats\". Dora Maar had by now given up photography. Perhaps her renewed enthusiasm for painting came about through painting those few strokes in Guernica; perhaps her proximity to a painter of genius inspired her anew. All the same, her submission to what seems to have been Picasso's wish demonstrates a great sacrifice of her talent and her individuality. She was intensely conscious of this, once saying about their relationship, \"I wasn't Picasso's mistress, he was just my master.\" One positive effect of her renunciation of photography was the renewal of her friendship with that other photographer of genius, Brassa\u00ef: \"Professional jealousy shaken off, there was no longer any obstacle to our friendship ...\" When Dora Maar's still lifes were exhibited in 1944, Brass\u00e4i insisted that one fact deserved underlining: \"She has managed to keep herself free of Picasso's formidable influence. Her still lifes - a loaf of bread, a pitcher or a jug - are extremely austere and recall nothing of her friend's colours or any of the periods of his work.\" Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, herself a painter, considered that Maar excelled in a chiaroscuro that was missing in Picasso's work, and in the painting of ordinary objects: \"Lamp or an alarm clock or a piece of bread ... [they] made you feel she wasn't so much interested in them as their solitude, the terrible solitude and void that surrounded everything in that penumbra.\" In December 1944, James Lord first sought out Picasso, hoping for a portrait of himself. He met Dora at lunch. She held out a gloved hand, pride and stylish accoutrements intact. Her gaze, says Lord, \"possessed remarkable radiance but could also be very hard. I observed that she was beautiful, with a strong, straight nose, perfect scarlet lips, the chin firm, the jaw a trifle heavy and the more forceful for being so, rich chestnut hair drawn smoothly back, and eyelashes like the furred antennae of moths.\" Before lighting her Gauloise, taken from Picasso's blue packet, she took out her gold cigarette holder, \"a slender tube several inches long like a tiny trumpet, with a black Bakelite mouthpiece and a flaring bell, into which she studiedly inserted the end of her cigarette. She had remarkably beautiful hands, the fingers exceptionally slender and graceful, with long, pointed, scarlet nails. Having set the cigarette into its holder, she placed the mouthpiece between her teeth and must have clenched them, because the holder jutted upward at an acute angle from her lips. Then she sat there, staring straight in front of her, moving not a muscle with the unlighted cigarette projecting into space.\" Picasso asked for a cigarette lighter; she answered that it must have been lost. Picasso shouted at her in Spanish and rapped his knuckles on the table loudly. \"But he appeared supremely indifferent to everyone but Dora, whose own indifference to Picasso's tirade was evidently absolute, as she simply sat there, the unlit cigarette immobile in front of her face.\" Picasso and Dora continued to see each other until 1946, but by then a final separation was inevitable. Friends had warned Dora that she should protect herself against Picasso, the satanic genius, her \"demon lover\", as people called him; but she had her pride, her stubbornness and her originality. There was now another terrible loss. On November 28, 1946, just after she and Nusch Eluard had been talking on the phone and making plans to meet for lunch while Paul Eluard was away in Switzerland, Nusch suddenly collapsed with a fatal cerebral haemorrhage. To Dora, it must have seemed that she was losing everyone she loved at the same time. During this sad period, Picasso and Fran\u00e7oise Gilot chanced upon Dora at an exhibition of the Unicorn tapestries, and they all went to lunch together at the restaurant Chez Francis. As Gilot tells the story, Dora ordered caviar: \"You don't mind if I order the most expensive thing on the menu, do you?\" she said. \"I suppose I still have the right to a little luxury, for the time being?\" Picasso insisted on telling her all about how marvellous Fran\u00e7oise was: \"What a mind! I've really discovered somebody, haven't I?\" Dora conversed in a witty fashion, but Picasso never laughed at her remarks at all, saving his hearty laughter for Fran\u00e7oise. Some time after that, Picasso ran into Dora again, this time at the Caf\u00e9 de Flore. He invited himself and Fran\u00e7oise to Dora's studio to see her paintings, and forced Dora to tell Fran\u00e7oise that it was all over between them. Fran\u00e7oise recalled that \"Dora Maar looked over at me briefly and witheringly. It was true; there was no longer anything between Pablo and her, she said, and I certainly shouldn't worry about being the cause of their breakup. That was about as preposterous an assumption as she could imagine.\" Dora then ventured that their affair wouldn't last, that Fran\u00e7oise would be \"out on the ash-heap before three months had passed\". Dora turned to Picasso: \"You've never loved anyone in your life. You don't know how to love.\" Tales of Dora's strange comportment in this period abound: she claimed to have been attacked and to have had her bicycle stolen, when in fact it was where she had left it, by the Seine. The same act was played out over other possessions. She was discovered naked on her stairs, and had to be ejected from a cinema where she was making a disturbance. She would force Eluard and Picasso to their knees and accuse them of leading sinful lives, insisting that they confess. She suffered a nervous breakdown. She was taken to a psychiatric hospital, where for three weeks she was subjected to a series of electric-shock treatments, and was then moved to a private clinic at the intervention of the psychiatrist Jacques Lacan, called upon by his close friend Paul Eluard. Picasso blamed Dora's breakdown not on his abandonment of her but on her association with the Surrealists, those irrational eccentrics. Just look how they ended, he said to Fran\u00e7oise: Jacques Vach\u00e9, Jacques Rigaut, Ren\u00e9 Crevel, all suicides; Antonin Artaud, completely mad. And, added Picasso, she had always been crazy. Dora underwent two years of analysis with Lacan. Little by little, she regained her poise and composure. According to Picasso, Lacan found himself forced to decide whether to leave Dora to her madness (and an eventual straitjacket) or to encourage in her a mystical tendency that was already apparent. He chose the latter, which, after a phase of occult belief and then a Buddhist period, placed her in the arms of the Roman Catholic Church. This did not, however, launch her immediately into a solitary life. Once past the worst of her private grief, there ensued a worldly period in which Maar became once more part of the sophisticated circuit. Georges Bernier was the editor of the art journal L'Oeil and had known Dora Maar since she was a young woman. \"Lacan had taken care of her, once more Dora was lively, playful. There was absolutely nothing of 'the weeping woman' about her. She lived a dizzying social life, went out a great deal with the Vicomtesse de Noailles and Lise Deharme, picked up with her old friends again.\" She had not, of course, forgotten Picasso. And even 10 years after they had separated, he never ceased in his attempts to humiliate her. In 1958, when he gave the critic and collector Douglas Cooper permission to produce a facsimile edition of a 1906 sketchbook, Picasso suggested he also look at a Facteur Cheval sketchbook that was in Dora's possession. Dora was initially reluctant to show the notebook. When she did, tearfully and only at Picasso's insistence, it turned out to contain close-up drawings of her crotch. For many years the former lovers maintained an unlikely exchange of gifts, whose meanings we can surmise. In 1954, Picasso sent Dora an elaborately packaged chair made of steel rods and coarse rope; it was both ungainly and uncomfortable. \"Isn't it the ugliest thing anybody ever saw!\" Picasso later exclaimed. Dora in return sent Picasso a rusty shovel blade, with which he was apparently rather impressed: \"Yes. Adorable Dora,\" he said. \"She would have had to select something just right.\" There was another gift, never sent. While rummaging through Picasso's belongings in 1983, a doctor from Canada found a small parcel wrapped in tissue paper with \"pour Dora Maar\" written on it. He wrote to her at the rue de Savoie many times to see when he could deliver this, but had no response. Finally, he unwrapped the parcel himself and found in it a small silver ring, \"resembling a flat signet ring with the engraved initials P-D [Pour Dora (for Dora)], but to my absolute amazement and horror, I found attached on the inside of the signet a large SPIKE! Thus it was absolutely impossible for anyone to wear it! I thanked my lucky stars for her refusing to accept this 'gift' from Picasso ...\" By the late 1950s Dora was living between her Paris apartment and her house in M\u00e9nerbes, where she spent the summers. In Provence, she painted still lifes and land scapes, and made some detailed drawings of the countryside, its trees and lanes and vines, its houses and its hills. Her still lifes were as stark as the Proven\u00e7al landscape. Shecontinued to concentrate on the pure object with the simplest backdrop, as she had done in her early photography. Now her focus was twofold: on her religious meditation and on her art. She had always loved Provence. Some of her photographs of the 1930s had captured perfectly the harshness of the raking light and the dry, often barren landscape of the hills. This terrain was a fitting backdrop for her later life as a recluse. Dora Maar was devout to the end. In M\u00e9nerbes, if the Mass was not being said in the local church, she would ask to be driven to nearby Notre-Dame-des-Lumi\u00e8res. She read widely to the end of her life. Fascinated by the moral problems of Catholicism, she read the novels of Graham Greene, and she even loved to read Spanish books in their English translations, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She also read auction catalogues to see what prices Picasso's paintings were fetching, for these were what she lived on at the end. She kept many paintings but sold others for large sums. Their value was increased by her ownership, as she well knew, \"and I'll tell you why. Because they're mine. On the walls of a gallery, maybe they're worth only half a million. On the walls of Picasso's mistress, they're worth a premium, the premium of history.\" Dora Maar died on July 16, 1997, at the age of 89. She had outlived Picasso by 24 years. To the end of her life, she treasured all that she had preserved of him. The kitchen was precious because he had stepped inside, the chairs, because he had sat in them. Her poems, kept in a medium-sized notebook end with a sketch headed \"Stage set for a tragedy\". The stage was indeed set, and the drama enacted. But Dora Maar's recuperation through her painting, her photography, and her private poetic record of pain and something beyond it, is not a tragedy, but rather a courageous reclamation of her own life, even in - perhaps especially in - solitude \u0095 This is an edited extract from Dora Maar With And Without Picasso: A Biography, by Mary Ann Caws, published by Thames &amp; Hudson on October 23, priced \u00a324.95.

It's the work not of a pop sociologist or nostalgia-peddler but of an artist, Tom Phillips, one of our most polymathic painters and a maker of beautiful and teasing books. It belongs to the category of millennial publications, but it has infinitely more layers and dimensions than the big photographic anthologies. Phillips has scrutinised and transcribed the scribbled messages of countless correspondents; his book is not just a graphic catalogue of popular icons but a democratic chorus of ordinary voices, a sounding board of the people. The brevity and impulsiveness of postcard messages, he notes, encouraged people who might have been daunted by the conventions of letter-writing. This vernacular intimacy gives the book a great humanity. </p> <p>At the same time The Postcard Century is a book by an artist, and a clever, modernist artist at that. So not only is it a delectable visual object, it plays artistic and philosophical games. Above all games of chance, learned in the school of William Burroughs, inventor of the cut-up, and John Cage, who wrote music governed by a throw of the dice. Like them, Phillips embraces randomness; it's William Blake's injunction to see the world in a grain of sand joined up with the 1930s Mass Observation movement that solicited diaries from ordinary people. But these postcard writers are not consciously documenting their own existence. Life - and its holidays, wars, loves, humour, separations, purchases, loss - seizes them too roughly for self-consciousness. The postcard is a brief, sudden expression. </p> <p>Each year in The Postcard Century gets four pages of images and text. A full-size postcard sets the keynote for each one: Kitchener's recruiting poster for 1914; the Allies' victory march passing the Cenotaph in 1919 (which Phillips, a determined mole of a researcher, informs us was a plaster replica, as the original was not ready in time); an agit-prop image from the World Student Peace Festival in East Berlin of 1951, sporting an exemplary trio of peace-loving young people - Caucasian male, Asian female, African male. \"We were warmly welcomed by the German people,\" reads the formulaic message. </p> <p>A mosaic of assorted cards continues the story of each year. Phillips has chosen images for historical and sociological reasons, but also for aesthetic and comedic ones: the henpecked but randy husbands and elephantine wives of Donald McGill's comic cards feature as frequently as the motor cars, planes, film stars, bombed cities and cemeteries of public record. A 1940 British Legion card sent from Mabel to Elsie shows a red poppy factory; Phillips notes that as late as 1999, 30 million red poppies were produced. The British saucy postcard, you learn, has no equivalent elsewhere. America would never have countenanced the double entendre in a 1911 card featuring two nurses discussing how they get by. \"I get 10/- a week and partial board,\" says one. \"Is that all?\" says the other. \"Why, I get 30/- a week and my whole board!\" </p> <p>He includes only cards that have actually been sent, and whose handwritten messages are in English. This opens the possibility of foreign editions with local variations from the chosen Anglo-American emphasis of this book. Postcards, so often emblazoned with tourist sites, are a world medium. Not even the ubiquitous mobile phone and email could replace the pleasure of picking \"a good view\" and adding one's calligraphic commentary. </p> <p>The messages on the back of the century's cards are often as evocative, funny and touching as the trench songs from Oh! What a Lovely War . In August 1907, Charlie writes to Rubie Weeks in Brighton on a card featuring the cricketer G Cox: \"Will you please meet me at the corner of Holbeck Row on Sunday morning and I will give you a suck of my toffee apple.\" Ken sends a picture of the Nuremberg Rally in 1936: \"I was given a fine free place near Hitler. I was at first pleased with the man's serious bearing but today . . . I was very disappointed in the content and meaning of his speech, because it was one long harangue of hatred against Jews &amp; Russia . . . I am sorry to be of this opinion because the German people are a very fine folk.\" Phillips adds a troubled question: \"What did Ken, in among these gathered faithful, do when saluting time came round?\" </p> <p>Just as often, the most telling messages are those which have no connection with world-historical events, but rather provide a poignant conjunction of opposites, a collision of the ordinary with the fateful. Annie in Southall writes to Mrs White in Reigate on a 1940 postcard of Churchill giving his \"We shall fight on the beaches\" speech: \"The skirt arrived Sat. O.K. Many Thanks indeed it fits fine and will be so warm. HMV won't release me yet but the Civil Defence are appealing against it as they want me . . . Essential work, packing.\" </p> <p>It's not only the handwritten messages that interest Phillips. He's as alert as any semiotician to the signs and signals in the cards, and more keen-eyed than most structuralists. Each of his yearly sections carries twinned, recurrent images of Piccadilly Circus and the New York skyline. They not only give him a time code - in London by the films playing at the London Pavilion and in New York by the rise of new skyscrapers - they also allow him to probe anomalies of visual and verbal information, using the removal and replacement of the Eros statue to unmask a brand-new postcard image as a recycled old one. He has a running commentary on the various printing processes, the major postcard publishers, the unsung postcard artists and photographers. But over and above this thematic and iconographic commentary, his Piccadilly Circus and Manhattan skyline recur as an almost musical reiteration of constancy and change. </p> <p>Indeed, there's a musical quality to the whole book. Not just in its references to \"the potency of cheap music\" - the faces of Marlene Dietrich (1937), Judy Garland (1949) and the Beatles (1963) trigger instant songs in the head - but in its total patterning. Phillips has mined his material to uncover leitmotifs - women, automobiles and aeroplanes; the cinema; architecture and fashion; the \"ethnic\"; the erotic and the comic - whose appearance and re-entry he lovingly charts. There's a polyphonic interweaving in his selection of each year's themes, and a counter point, not only between the private and the public, but between the obviously important and the haphazardly relevant. His own notations have the laconic poetry of Count Basie's pointillist piano solos. He captions a ruined 1943 London street: \"With hindsight and even in memory bombsites had their own beauty and became grown over with grass and willow-herb with amazing speed. Present-day children's adventure playgrounds are a tame imitation of what a mature bombsite was to the wartime child.\" </p> <p>There's a reason why The Postcard Century sings, and is so much more than a millennial wheeze. It comes out of Phillips's 30-year engagement with the postcard, which has produced such haunting works as Benches in the Tate, a Beckettian prospect of mortality drawn from postcard images of old people on benches in municipal parks. Above all The Postcard Century comes from the centrepiece of Phillips's work, the \"treated novel\" A Humument , in which he repeatedly buries much of the text of a Victorian novel to reveal a hidden narrative complete with poems, epigrams and new characters (the hero is called \"bill toge\" and only appears when \"together\" or \"altogether\" appear in the original text). In a similar way, Phillips speculates on the characters and narratives of his vanished postcard-senders and of the blurred bystanders in the pictures, while uncovering landscapes of wonder and networks of meaning in the ephemera of our age. Forget about whether The Postcard Century is high or popular culture. Anyone can see that it's just good.</p>",

Above all The Postcard Century comes from the centrepiece of Phillips's work, the \"treated novel\" A Humument , in which he repeatedly buries much of the text of a Victorian novel to reveal a hidden narrative complete with poems, epigrams and new characters (the hero is called \"bill toge\" and only appears when \"together\" or \"altogether\" appear in the original text). In a similar way, Phillips speculates on the characters and narratives of his vanished postcard-senders and of the blurred bystanders in the pictures, while uncovering landscapes of wonder and networks of meaning in the ephemera of our age. Forget about whether The Postcard Century is high or popular culture. Anyone can see that it's just good.",

In addition, the novel as a literary form has moved on in the past 150 years; it is questionable whether a book as great as its subject is still possible in what is now a dated, if not wholly outdated, form. As a conventional novelist, James Thackara does not address this question, and his book leaves it unanswered; 25 years in the writing, it remains an ambitious failure. </p> <p>Tolstoy had the good sense to stick, for the most part, to what he knew, which was Russia; he knew where his heart was too. Thackara is an American, and his narrative is all over the place, since he collects a small bunch of principal characters of various nationalities and then follows their movements over large parts of the globe. As a result one tends to doubt his credibility, particularly since he peppers his text with bits of German that are almost invariably inaccurate. </p> <p>The selection of characters Thackara chooses to focus on is also rather odd, creating a distinctly lopsided view of the second world war. England and the rest of the British are excluded, which is a bit like writing an account of Waterloo with no Duke of Wellington. The narrative begins in 1932 with four students sharing a Paris flat - two Germans, an American and, oddly, a half-caste youth from Algeria. This is a bunch of young people having a good time and not yet interested in politics, apart from Justin Lothaire, the Algerian, who was politicised by childhood poverty and has a burning ambition to be a writer. David von Sunda will turn out to be a good but ineffectual German and Johannes Godard a silly, misguided one. Duncan Penn is a spare part, doing absolutely nothing in the US for several hundred pages until he has his moment of glory as an all-American hero, and promptly gets killed. </p> <p>Conscious of the immensity of his subject - its 50 million dead - and anxious to avoid the plodding prose of the blockbuster, Thackara adopts a high-flown, poetic style that sets one's teeth on edge. On the other hand, he does know how to keep an eventful narrative moving, so that one skims hastily over the stylistic infelicities in order to find out what happens next; and both the story and the characters are refreshingly unpredictable. </p> <p>David von Sunda marries a Frenchwoman and leaves for Mexico as war becomes inevitable. To avoid his family property being confiscated, he later comes back and joins the Wehrmacht. Being a good German, he gets embroiled with the July plot to kill Hitler, but is too cowardly to do the deed when he gets the chance in the Adlon Hotel and deserts from the Russian front, ending up in a forced labour camp as a wanted man. His brother is executed, but David survives to be reunited with his wife and children. After the war he turns down a job at the UN in favour of rebuilding the family fortune in South America. </p> <p>The problem with his friend Johannes, meanwhile, is that his head has been clouded by too much German philosophy, while his body is in thrall to the sexual charms of a Wagnerian soprano - a fatal combination. When, belatedly, the scales fall from his eyes and he finds out that his Nazi cronies are a bunch of murdering thugs, he tries to make a run for it and gets bumped off by the Gestapo. </p> <p>The time has now come, dear reader, for America to save the world. Enter Duncan Penn, along with seven million others, raring to go - even if it is 1944 and not 1939. \"In the US 3rd Army, there was impatience at the scholarly pace of Field Marshal Montgomery's joint invasion plan.\" I seem to remember that the impatience was all on Churchill and Monty's side, and that if Montgomery had had his way the Allies would have been in Berlin by Christmas, the war shortened and Russia held back. Instead Patton and the 3rd Army took the less risky option of heading south. Here Thackara behaves just like Hollywood, which has been annoying war-weary Britons with its \"How America won the war\" films since 1945. Dunkirk does not get a mention, even though much of the action takes place in occupied France; it might raise awkward questions on the whereabouts of Duncan Penn and his compatriots when their help was most needed and not given. </p> <p>Another significant absence is the Jews, mentioned as a \"race\" being exterminated rather as if they lived on the moon. They were of course an integral part of European life; every character in this novel would in reality have been confronted by personal dilemmas when asked to help desperate individuals. But not a word.

Buy the book and read it. Let's get on.) In its very early days Gemma Bovery had failed to attract me: thin social comment with literary aspirations, I thought, neither a fully fledged cartoon nor a prose work. Too text-heavy for one, too text-light for the other. And what was all that \"Bovery\" stuff? Can we try not to rely on the classics? </p> <p>This attitude lasted for about four days. Not only is a cartoon a cartoon - and therefore, apart from the book reviews, the most enjoyable part of any newspaper - but Posy Simmonds is Posy Simmonds. Like everyone else, I began to marvel at ... well, there is rather a lot to marvel at. Like every single drawing, for a start. From the simplest of lines Simmonds can conjure up a world of nuance and even novelistic insight. I do not exaggerate. Gemma's thought-bubble at the bottom of page 65 told me more than I had ever known about the working of a woman's mind in love. But any drawing of Gemma's face tells its own story with clarity and force. The same applies to her husband, Charlie, whose shifts between dreaminess and irritation are equally well captured. Even the minor characters are treated with equal care; Mme Sannier, for instance, with her pop-eyed, provincial, soign\u00e9 niceness and cretinous conversation (\"la reine M\u00e8re - elle a quelle ge maintenant?\") - Simmonds gets everyone bang to rights. Her characters have expressions you could write monographs on even when their eyes are represented by nothing more than dots. </p> <p>But what makes GB so much more than a work of social satire is the way that her graphic line gives everyone, even the most potentially irredeemable, a chance. At the end of page 71, Delphine, Herv\u00e9's girlfriend, moves from being a shallowly drawn little BCBG nonentity and, at the moment she discovers Herv\u00e9's infidelity, is allowed to become a true portrait. It shows how Simmonds has the ambiguous tenderness of a true creator: almost taken aback by her own skill, one imagines. There is a definite if restrained relish in the way she moves her characters into situations where they can be drawn so well. </p> <p>There is more than just drawing going on here, of course. There is pacing - GB moves from illustrated text to straight comic strip and back again - and there is the prose, from the narrative frame of Joubert, the nosy, creepy baker (for whom we feel a strange kind of pity), to Gemma's diaries, and down to the speech-bubbles of all the characters. Simmonds has, in this sense, two kinds of blank paper staring at her every morning, and she should be honoured for filling them so perfectly, with such a combination of daring and what looks like effortlessness. That she has to do two nationalities as well - would she perhaps care to make things more difficult for herself next time? And, please, can there be a next time very, very soon?

According to Forbes, he makes in excess of $50,000,000 a year (and I didn't accidentally add a few zeros). It all began in 1974 with his first novel Carrie, about a teenage girl with supernatural powers. Some 30 novels and half a dozen story collections later, the man has never looked back, pounding out blockbusters in a way that redefines the word. Not since Dickens has a writer had so many readers - I confess to being one of them - by the throat. Much of his fiction has, of course, been turned into films. As if this weren't enough, King has also written five novels under the name of Richard Bachman and spun out nearly a dozen screenplays or teleplays. On top of which, he's a nice guy. </p> <p>The niceness comes through in his books, encoded in the voice itself: a loud but down-to-earth, friendly and innocent voice that might be America (or America's vision of itself) talking. The fact is, King has got more of postwar America into his fiction than almost any other writer now at work. That he has chosen to write in a particular genre - horror - has, unquestionably, worked against his critical reputation. Perhaps rightly, critics have wondered about his seriousness. The novels are terribly uneven, and even the best of them - The Shining, Pet Sematary, Dolores Claiborne, The Green Mile, Bag of Bones - tend to puff and wheeze after a while like an overweight man on a treadmill. Only his most recent novel, The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, is tautly written. Nevertheless, King's imagination is vast. He knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers, and they have rewarded him handsomely. </p> <p>Lately, King has been on the literary equivalent of a rampage. Bag of Bones was a big, distorted yet wonderfully entertaining novel that rode high on the bestseller lists in 1998. Hard on the heels of that success came a fine collection of stories, Hearts in Atlantis (1999). That same year, he also published The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon - a chilling, often beautiful novel about a young girl lost in the woods. For almost the first time, reviewers sat up respectfully, noting the depth and shapeliness of this work. One could no longer dismiss King as just another bad writer proffering cheap thrills to the multitudes. </p> <p>That same year, he brought out his first electronic book, Riding the Bullet. This novella was the world's first mass-market e-book, released through his conventional publisher, Scribner. Half a million downloads later, the publishing industry had to face up to something new under the sun. Soon the idea occurred to King that he might try e-publishing without a conventional publisher in the background. He would simply post a book on his website and request a dollar from anybody who downloaded it. Instead of writing something fresh, however, he rooted through his bottom drawer and found a long-abandoned piece of fiction called The Plant. It's a revenge fantasy about a frustrated author who sends a man-eating vine to devour his publishers. \"My friends,\" King wrote on his website (<a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com\">www.stephenking.com</a>), \"we have the chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare.\" Although not as successful as Riding the Bullet, the new work did well enough to please King. (For the record, I sent him a dollar.) </p> <p>Now comes On Writing: A Memoir. It is part biography, part collection of tips for the aspiring writer. In the final chapters, King tells, in graphic detail, the story of his recent accident. In June 1999 he was near his home in Maine, taking his usual four-mile stroll along a rural route. Unexpectedly, a blue Dodge minivan lurched over the hilltop, totally out of control. It was driven by a local man called Bryan Smith. King notes, casually: \"Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together because his rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the backseat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside.\" Smith thought at first that he had hit \"a small deer\". </p> <p>It was King he hit. After bouncing off the windscreen, the author found himself at the side of the road with his lap turned the wrong way. One of his legs was broken in nine places, \"like so many marbles in a sock\", as his surgeon later explained. He had a collapsed lung and lacerations on his scalp. </p> <p>His devoted wife Tabitha (herself a novelist) stayed by him through several agonising weeks during which it was not clear whether King would ever walk again. His three grown children - Joe, Naomi and Owen - were by his side as well. King's gratitude shines through this memoir. One comes away from it liking King a great deal and admiring his family. </p> <p>Understanding her husband's compulsion to write, Tabitha established the wheelchaired King at a makeshift desk in a hallway of their rambling Victorian house only five weeks after the accident. That King could possibly summon the will to work in this situation is nothing less than astounding. He wrote a little at first, then a lot. Soon, it was business as usual: the author as locomotive, charging down the tracks of narrative, rock music blaring in the background. The pages gathered on his desk. In the 15 or so months since his accident, he has poured out the e-novella, Riding the Bullet, most of a teleplay in six hour-long parts for American television, and a 900-page novel, Dreamcatcher. Oh, yes, and he added the memoir of his accident to a book about the craft of writing that he'd already finished. </p> <p>King has nothing much to say about writing that isn't obvious. \"In my view, stories and novels consist of three parts,\" he explains with professorial solemnity: \"narration, description, and dialogue.\" He warns us: \"The adverb is not your friend.\" He advises writing behind a closed door: \"It is your way of telling the world and yourself that you mean business; you have made a serious commitment to write and intend to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\" Oh dear. King is infinitely better at writing than talking about writing, though fans will doubtless find moments of interest here, especially when he talks about his own extraordinary writing habits. </p> <p>The best part of the book remains his account of how writing - and the primitive urge to write - saved his life after the accident. It's a bizarre and absorbing story, told brilliantly by one of the great storytellers of our time. One only hopes he lives to write many more books, however uneven.

When Joseph Addison travelled to Italy in the 1690s, he hoped \"to compare the Natural Face of the Country with the Landskips that the Poets have given us of it\". He acknowledged what, since Romanticism, has become a less obvious thought: that landscapes are what we carry in our heads rather than what we discover. </p> <p>And so, when it comes to enjoying a landscape, perhaps we are all conservatives. \"Unspoiled\" became a term of praise from the 1920s, as arterial sprawl edged outwards from the towns. It has become the best that can be said for any rural view. Poetry of landscape concentrates this appetite for what satisfies our visual ideals. Since Wordsworth, at least, poetry has tried to conserve the memory of particular places, which return to please the \"inward eye\". </p> <p>Kenneth Baker begins his introduction to The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry with a candidly financial metaphor for this desire to conserve our visions of the land. \"The two greatest assets that we have in our country are its language and its landscape.\" As well as having been Thatcher's Environment Minister, Baker has edited The Faber Book of Conservatism, and sometimes it seems that his new anthology might be a continuation of that task. He has placed at the front of the book, as if it were a manifesto, Wordsworth's \"The Tables Turned\", which proclaims that \"Sweet is the lore which Nature brings\". Much of the poetry he has chosen tries to find this \"lore\" sustaining, and a good deal of it preserves in verse what seems to be being lost in reality. </p> <p>Baker's amiably jumbled arrangement of poems into 37 weakly thematic sections conceals the historical distinctiveness of his material (the only dates are the births and deaths of his poets, buried in the index). From around the late 18th century, the poetry of British landscape echoes with the sense of precariousness, of endangerment or desecration. We can hear it sharp in Gerard Manley Hopkins's \"Inversnaid\": \"O let them be left, wildness and wet;/ Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet\". Gloomily we hear it in Philip Larkin's \"Going, Going\", regretting the loss of \"The shadows, the meadows, the lanes,/ The guildhalls, the carved choirs\". </p> <p>An early voicing of this strain is William Cowper's The Task (1785), represented by several extracts here. For Cowper the destroyers of the countryside are the modern landowners. \"Estates are landscapes, gaz'd upon a while,/ Then advertis'd and auctioneer'd away\". Enclosures are behind the Tory Oliver Goldsmith's \"The Deserted Village\", an elegiac vision of rural life destroyed by trade and wealth. Their effects are sardonically observed by agricultural labourer John Clare, who sees a land of fences and \"no entry\" signs, \"As tho the very birds should learn to know/ When they go there they must no further go\". Baker's section on \"Birds and Birdsong\" echoes with nightingales and thrushes, Clare's bushes full of \"larks\" and Edward Thomas's songs of \"all the birds/ Of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire\"; they now seem sounds from distant times. </p> <p>Yet once, in imitation of Virgil's Georgics, poets celebrated rural \"industry\" and \"improvement\". A passage from the 18th-century poet John Dyer happily includes in his Yorkshire landscape the smoke from the growing towns of the West Riding - an \"incense of thanksgiving\". Human forming of landscapes could be celebrated. In the 17th century, Andrew Marvell's poetry turned nature into a garden, delighting in what man ordered. </p> <p>The book features a map of Britain and Ireland with the names of poets instead of places scattered across it. It illustrates another Wordsworthian poetic value, which earlier poets would have found strange. This is particularity - truth to a certain place, to \"things founded clean on their own shapes\", as Seamus Heaney has it in \"The Peninsula\". Some poems ask not so much to be judged as poetry as to be matched against a real place. </p> <p>This was not always so. Britain was once the resort of gods and nymphs, a place of groves and grottoes where, as in Milton's \"L'Allegro\", zephyrs blew and eglantine twisted itself around the poet's bower. The poet looked through the lens of his classical reading (and perhaps the paintings of Poussin or Claude). </p> <p>Other pre-Romantic verse is archaeological or etymological. A short extract from Michael Drayton's wonderfully strange Poly-Olbion (a topographical glorification of England) celebrates the fertility of the fens around Ely by listing all the area's fish-filled rivers and streams like a whimsical angler's gazetteer. Such delight is echoed in UA Fanthorpe's \"Rising Damp\", about the \"little fervent underground/ Rivers of London\", whose buried names are still followed through the city. </p> <p>Rarely can we rely on these connections. This capacious collection has its pleasures and surprises, but these are not usually the result of meetings across the centuries. For while Baker's anthology may conceal the history that has made our ideas of landscape, the poems he admires have not done so. They show that landscapes kept alive in poetry are also, as Wordsworth called them, \"spots of time\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry edited by Kenneth Baker 437pp, Faber \u00a325 Buy it at BOL Before the place, there is the picture of the place; before we see, we have been taught how to look. \"Landscape\", that word for the pleasing shapes of the countryside, began as a technical term for painters, a word for a delightful artifice. When Joseph Addison travelled to Italy in the 1690s, he hoped \"to compare the Natural Face of the Country with the Landskips that the Poets have given us of it\". He acknowledged what, since Romanticism, has become a less obvious thought: that landscapes are what we carry in our heads rather than what we discover. And so, when it comes to enjoying a landscape, perhaps we are all conservatives. \"Unspoiled\" became a term of praise from the 1920s, as arterial sprawl edged outwards from the towns. It has become the best that can be said for any rural view. Poetry of landscape concentrates this appetite for what satisfies our visual ideals. Since Wordsworth, at least, poetry has tried to conserve the memory of particular places, which return to please the \"inward eye\". Kenneth Baker begins his introduction to The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry with a candidly financial metaphor for this desire to conserve our visions of the land. \"The two greatest assets that we have in our country are its language and its landscape.\" As well as having been Thatcher's Environment Minister, Baker has edited The Faber Book of Conservatism, and sometimes it seems that his new anthology might be a continuation of that task. He has placed at the front of the book, as if it were a manifesto, Wordsworth's \"The Tables Turned\", which proclaims that \"Sweet is the lore which Nature brings\". Much of the poetry he has chosen tries to find this \"lore\" sustaining, and a good deal of it preserves in verse what seems to be being lost in reality. Baker's amiably jumbled arrangement of poems into 37 weakly thematic sections conceals the historical distinctiveness of his material (the only dates are the births and deaths of his poets, buried in the index). From around the late 18th century, the poetry of British landscape echoes with the sense of precariousness, of endangerment or desecration. We can hear it sharp in Gerard Manley Hopkins's \"Inversnaid\": \"O let them be left, wildness and wet;/ Long live the weeds and the wilderness yet\".

They arrived at this point not as a result of long-term plans, but because other non-lethal expedients to get rid of the Jews had failed. Mass murder may have been latent within their aspirations in 1939 to banish Jews to a reservation in Poland, their hopes of using Madagascar as a dumping ground in 1940 or their dream of driving Jews across the Urals in 1941, but extermination was not then a fully fledged policy and they had no means to carry it out. </p> <p>If it was not inevitable, annihilation was conceivable because within the Nazi machine a consensus about what to do with the Jews already existed. In 1939-40, the Nazis had already engaged in massive transfers of population in Poland that included the savage eviction of Jews. The regime had previously crossed the threshold into criminality and mass murder when Hitler authorised the murder of physically and mentally disabled Germans in September 1939. The readiness to deal with the Jews in the harshest way now met with the availability of expertise in killing on a huge scale. Lower-level initiatives - what Ian Kershaw calls \"local genocides\" - were joined up by central direction into the \"Final Solution\". </p> <p>By now knowledge about the mass shootings of entire Jewish communities in the Soviet Union was percolating back into the Reich.

If you don't want to go, we will remove you violently,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe later told a meeting of his party's central committee that the British government was working with the MDC to create unrest in the cities, \"in the hope that a Zanu-PF government will capitulate or fall in violent circumstances\".</p> <p>The day after his speech, Mr Tsvangirai left on a scheduled trip to Europe and South Africa. He was due to fly back to Harare on Tuesday but delayed his return after various government ministers called for his arrest.</p> <p>The speaker of parliament demanded his detention and prosecution for treason. The police described the \"threat of violence\" as unlawful and said they were prepared to act.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said he had not intended to use the word \"violently\" and meant \"unceremoniously\", and that there was no legitimate reason to arrest him for his comments.</p> <p>\"It was undiplomatic, I must say, but it certainly wasn't treason,\" he said. \"The law cannot be applied selectively; one law for the MDC and another for Zanu-PF. There have been instances of people threatening to use weapons of war and they have not been arrested.\"</p> <p>More than 30 people have died in politically related violence in recent months, either during the occupation of white-owned farms or in attacks on MDC supporters. But there have been no arrests.</p> <p>Ominously, one of Mr Mugabe's old-guard supporters, Nathan Shamuyarira, warned that the ruling party would be more than a match for any uprising.</p> <p>\"The area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe could not afford another two years of Mr Mugabe until the next presidential election.</p> <p>\"I understand he still thinks he has more to contribute to Zimbabwe. That state of mind is delusionary. What he is involved in is the tactics of survival, not a strategy for the survival of the country.\"</p> <p>But he said that if Zimbabweans wanted change, they should learn from the example of Belgrade and not expect others to do it for them.</p> <p>\"You cannot watch a situation where things collapse in your hands and you expect a miracle to come from somewhere,\" he said.</p> <p>The government remains defiant. On Thursday the police shut down Zimbabwe's first independent radio station, less than a week after it went on air, in defiance of a supreme court ruling. The high court has ordered the chief of police and his deputy to appear in court on Monday to explain why they should not be jailed for contempt. The government accused Britain of \"making threats\" to try to stop the move against the radio station.</p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai said this was further evidence of Mr Mugabe's desperation.</p> <p>\"It is an illustration of a government that's intolerant of opposing views,\" he said. \"It does not want the space for any mouthpiece other than that which supports Zanu-PF views.\"</p>",

Mr Mugabe later told a meeting of his party's central committee that the British government was working with the MDC to create unrest in the cities, \"in the hope that a Zanu-PF government will capitulate or fall in violent circumstances\". The day after his speech, Mr Tsvangirai left on a scheduled trip to Europe and South Africa. He was due to fly back to Harare on Tuesday but delayed his return after various government ministers called for his arrest. The speaker of parliament demanded his detention and prosecution for treason. The police described the \"threat of violence\" as unlawful and said they were prepared to act. Mr Tsvangirai said he had not intended to use the word \"violently\" and meant \"unceremoniously\", and that there was no legitimate reason to arrest him for his comments. \"It was undiplomatic, I must say, but it certainly wasn't treason,\" he said. \"The law cannot be applied selectively; one law for the MDC and another for Zanu-PF. There have been instances of people threatening to use weapons of war and they have not been arrested.\" More than 30 people have died in politically related violence in recent months, either during the occupation of white-owned farms or in attacks on MDC supporters. But there have been no arrests. Ominously, one of Mr Mugabe's old-guard supporters, Nathan Shamuyarira, warned that the ruling party would be more than a match for any uprising. \"The area of violence is an area where Zanu-PF has a very strong, long and successful history,\" he said. Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe could not afford another two years of Mr Mugabe until the next presidential election. \"I understand he still thinks he has more to contribute to Zimbabwe. That state of mind is delusionary. What he is involved in is the tactics of survival, not a strategy for the survival of the country.\" But he said that if Zimbabweans wanted change, they should learn from the example of Belgrade and not expect others to do it for them. \"You cannot watch a situation where things collapse in your hands and you expect a miracle to come from somewhere,\" he said. The government remains defiant. On Thursday the police shut down Zimbabwe's first independent radio station, less than a week after it went on air, in defiance of a supreme court ruling. The high court has ordered the chief of police and his deputy to appear in court on Monday to explain why they should not be jailed for contempt. The government accused Britain of \"making threats\" to try to stop the move against the radio station. Mr Tsvangirai said this was further evidence of Mr Mugabe's desperation. \"It is an illustration of a government that's intolerant of opposing views,\" he said. \"It does not want the space for any mouthpiece other than that which supports Zanu-PF views.\"",

They both tease and observe the stale decencies of party loyalty as they wait for the all-consuming Europhobic jihad to end. Welcome to the world of the One Nation Tories: prophets, apparently, without the Tory temple walls.</p> <p>The idea that the One Nation tendency is a very good thing is now widely, and uncritically, accepted beyond the fantasy-patrolled boundaries of the Conservative party. The phrase is a happy one, but what does it mean? What, in particular, has it meant to those who rose by its incantation?</p> <p>Disraeli was the first to use the language of two nations as he looked at the rich and the poor: \"Between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones.\" That's not a bad description of the relation, or lack of it, between the modern Conservative party and the rest of us.</p> <p>Thus far, then, thus charitable. But Disraeli is also a neat illustration of the old Oscar Wilde truth that the sentimentalist is the cynic on a Bank Holiday. His working classes - those \"angels trapped in marble\" - were to be released and protected from radicalism. They were also to be seduced into political passivity by the manipulative Disraelian rhetoric of the nation - a new royalism and a new imperialism.</p> <p>Disraeli's \"young England\" was really very old and hierarchical, a mock-medieval England of useful myths packaged for the credulous in campery's pink ribbons. Suffering would be alleviated but its structural causes retained. Shaftesbury - another Tory liberal titan - pioneered legislation on working conditions but did so in a thoroughly moralising way.

From Churchill to Heath they were the Tories who mattered - and even in bleaker times they were members of the high command. When John Major got into a fix he sometimes claimed to be one of them. Now they are kings over the water - toasted by ever diminishing cliques within their own party, but acclaimed in wider, saner society. They both tease and observe the stale decencies of party loyalty as they wait for the all-consuming Europhobic jihad to end. Welcome to the world of the One Nation Tories: prophets, apparently, without the Tory temple walls. The idea that the One Nation tendency is a very good thing is now widely, and uncritically, accepted beyond the fantasy-patrolled boundaries of the Conservative party. The phrase is a happy one, but what does it mean? What, in particular, has it meant to those who rose by its incantation? Disraeli was the first to use the language of two nations as he looked at the rich and the poor: \"Between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones.\" That's not a bad description of the relation, or lack of it, between the modern Conservative party and the rest of us. Thus far, then, thus charitable. But Disraeli is also a neat illustration of the old Oscar Wilde truth that the sentimentalist is the cynic on a Bank Holiday. His working classes - those \"angels trapped in marble\" - were to be released and protected from radicalism. They were also to be seduced into political passivity by the manipulative Disraelian rhetoric of the nation - a new royalism and a new imperialism. Disraeli's \"young England\" was really very old and hierarchical, a mock-medieval England of useful myths packaged for the credulous in campery's pink ribbons. Suffering would be alleviated but its structural causes retained. Shaftesbury - another Tory liberal titan - pioneered legislation on working conditions but did so in a thoroughly moralising way. The point about lice was that they produced vice and grime led to crime. Dirt was dangerous because it threatened the fabric of order. The more you change, the more you keep. One Nation Toryism was successful in England for a long time and was in its way quite a sophisticated construct. It said that capitalism was necessary but caused suffering.

Another Serbian opposition figure said yesterday that he had talked to the interior minister: \"I have had contacts with Vlajko Stojiljkovic and he has accused the democratic opposition of causing incidents in the parliament and television,\" Momcilo Perisic told reporters. The four Milosevic associates are accused of crimes against humanity - \"part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against the Kosovo Albanian civilian population of Kosovo\" - including violating \"the laws or customs of war\", deportation, murder, and persecution on political, racial and religious grounds. The long and detailed indictments call on all UN governments to investigate whether the four men have assets in their countries and, if so, to freeze them. There are also an unknown number of indicted Bosnian Serbs suspected of having fled to Serbia since the ethnic conflict in Bosnia ended in 1995, Paul Risley, spokesman for the chief prosecutor at the Hague tribunal, Carla del Ponte, said yesterday. They include the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic who, Mr Risley said, had been spotted in Belgrade a week ago, and his former military commander, Ratko Mladic.

A brooding recluse and diabetic, he is known to suffer from periodic bouts of depression. It was not clear yesterday whether Mirjana Markovic, his strong-willed wife who, if anything, is even more hated in Serbia than Mr Milosevic, was still in Belgrade, or whether the couple's son and daughter were still there.</p> <p>His brother dismissed all such talk of depression and of escape plans. \"There are absolutely no reasons to leave the country. These are rumours being spread to give credence to rumours about him being demoralised... Why should he leave the country? Half the population supports him. He is the leader of a major party.\"</p> <p>But reporting to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, on his talks in Belgrade, Mr Ivanov and his boss \"considered measures needed to maintain peace\" in Yugoslavia. Since Mr Milosevic's continued presence in the country is widely seen as the biggest threat to peace, it appeared likely that his safe haven options were also discussed with the Russians. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Mr Putin also discussed the dilemmas later yesterday. They are also believed to have discussed Mr Milosevic's exit options in Moscow on September 25, the day after Mr Kostunica's poll victory.</p> <p>Iraq, China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have all been mentioned as possible boltholes. Mr Milosevic's three lost Balkan wars made refugees of more than 3m people. Now his family may share their fate - displaced and homeless.</p> <p>Along with the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, he is the world's most wanted man. The Hague tribunal indicted him for war crimes in Kosovo last year and is seeking to charge him with further war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia.</p> <p>That makes it highly unlikely that the Kremlin would give him a safe haven. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said yesterday that the asylum issue \"has not been raised or discussed in that way... We are far from assuming that we have to consider the matter in that light.\"</p> <p>More hopefully for Mr Milosevic, the prime minister of Belarus, Vladimir Yermoshin, said that Minsk would consider approaches for \"political asylum\", but that none had been made. His boss, President Alexander Lukashenko, said that no one from the Belgrade regime had requested sanctuary.</p> <p>\"He has many options,\" said Mr Lukashenko. \"Milosevic simply has no grounds for leaving Yugoslavia.\"</p> <p>Despite the statements from Borislav Milosevic, the ambassador admitted last night that he had not spoken to his younger brother yesterday.</p> <p>Apart from sticking unfailingly and triumphantly to his line that Mr Milosevic had to go, Mr Kostunica has made no threatening noises towards the Milosevic family or the regime. He has repeatedly said he will not hand over Mr Milosevic to the tribunal in the Hague, which he views as an illegitimate political tool of the west.</p> <p>But if Mr Kostunica lacks rancour and vengefulness, it is not clear that will be able to rein in hotter tempers bent on meting out rough justice to the hated Milosevic family and the former regime's retinue of cronies and criminals.</p> <p>It appeared that the Russian mediation in Belgrade yesterday was aimed at preempting any such bloodshed, though it was not clear how. Mr Putin departed for his home town of St Petersburg last night on the eve of his birthday without providing any clues as to what should become of Mr Milosevic.</p>",

The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and Mr Putin also discussed the dilemmas later yesterday. They are also believed to have discussed Mr Milosevic's exit options in Moscow on September 25, the day after Mr Kostunica's poll victory. Iraq, China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus have all been mentioned as possible boltholes. Mr Milosevic's three lost Balkan wars made refugees of more than 3m people. Now his family may share their fate - displaced and homeless. Along with the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, he is the world's most wanted man. The Hague tribunal indicted him for war crimes in Kosovo last year and is seeking to charge him with further war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia. That makes it highly unlikely that the Kremlin would give him a safe haven. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, said yesterday that the asylum issue \"has not been raised or discussed in that way... We are far from assuming that we have to consider the matter in that light.\" More hopefully for Mr Milosevic, the prime minister of Belarus, Vladimir Yermoshin, said that Minsk would consider approaches for \"political asylum\", but that none had been made. His boss, President Alexander Lukashenko, said that no one from the Belgrade regime had requested sanctuary. \"He has many options,\" said Mr Lukashenko. \"Milosevic simply has no grounds for leaving Yugoslavia.\" Despite the statements from Borislav Milosevic, the ambassador admitted last night that he had not spoken to his younger brother yesterday. Apart from sticking unfailingly and triumphantly to his line that Mr Milosevic had to go, Mr Kostunica has made no threatening noises towards the Milosevic family or the regime. He has repeatedly said he will not hand over Mr Milosevic to the tribunal in the Hague, which he views as an illegitimate political tool of the west. But if Mr Kostunica lacks rancour and vengefulness, it is not clear that will be able to rein in hotter tempers bent on meting out rough justice to the hated Milosevic family and the former regime's retinue of cronies and criminals. It appeared that the Russian mediation in Belgrade yesterday was aimed at preempting any such bloodshed, though it was not clear how. Mr Putin departed for his home town of St Petersburg last night on the eve of his birthday without providing any clues as to what should become of Mr Milosevic.",

The case went before Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, head of the high court's family division, to test the effect of the new Human Rights Act on doctors' right to withdraw artificial feeding in patients' best interests. The House of Lords ruled in 1993, in the case of the Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland, that doctors could withdraw tube feeding from patients who were in a permanent vegetative state (PVS), because it conferred no benefit on them. Since then, around 20 such patients have been allowed to die, but the law had to be reconsidered in the light of the Human Rights Act. The act, which came into force last Monday, makes the European convention on human rights part of UK law. The convention places a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life. Dame Elizabeth made declarations that doctors could lawfully withdraw treatment from the two women, who are both in PVS, after hearing evidence and submissions over two days from representatives of the two NHS trusts involved and the official solicitor on behalf of the patients. In both cases, she said the two women, identified only as Ms H, 36, and Mrs M, 49, lacked the capacity to make decisions about their future medical treatment. She said it was not in their best interests to continue artificial nutrition and hydration. Both women's families want them to be allowed to die. Mrs M has been vegetative for three years after an anaesthetic mishap during a gynaecological operation overseas. Ms H, who suffers from severe epilepsy, had a heart attack while in hospital last January, depriving her brain of oxygen. Two weeks ago her feeding tube became blocked and doctors were unable to unblock it. The hospital trust treating Ms H said in a statement: \"The decision today represents a further stage in what has been, and continues to be, a difficult and very sad time for everyone involved in this tragic case. \"The application was made only after a very thorough and rigorous process of seeking independent medical opinion, and discussion with the family.\" The trust looking after Mrs M said: \"It is the wish of the family and those responsible for the medical and nursing care of this patient that she is permitted to end her life peacefully and with dignity.\" Lawyers for the trusts and the patients told Dame Elizabeth that both sides agreed that the principles laid down by the House of Lords in the Bland case complied with the European convention. John Grace QC, for the trusts, both of which are in the north of England, said that the patients were \"victims\" of medical technology that did not exist when the human rights convention was drawn up in 1950. But the principles established in the Bland case amounted to \"an adequate protection\" under the convention's right-to-life provisions.",

Up to 1993, Mr Partonic was able to work within the publishing house on an international edition of Politika that caused him no dilemmas. When it shut down, he was transferred to Politika's main newspaper. \"From that time, I started an internal fight against the editorial policy, and the culmination of this fight was yesterday,\" he said. He was moved from his job in the foreign policy section to the financial section, where he would not have to deal directly with the regime's political news. Five other journalists suffered similar moves because of their views, he said. Then on Thursday everything changed. When he came to work there were 100 police special forces in the building with guns, bullet-proof vests and camouflage gear. They were there to protect Politika's director, an intimate friend of the Milosevic family, he said. It was a turbulent day. According to the new Politika, a courier was assaulted by two of the director's bodyguards for destroying a notice forbidding a meeting to discuss a strike at the paper. Mr Partonic said there was a difficult atmosphere throughout the day as the revolution raged outside. Aside from the strikers, the remainder of the journalists worked normally. \"Then our chief came and told us at 7pm to leave the building and we all went out by the back door.\" The director went out with several police and was driven away in their van. The 62 striking journalists went for a drink, then returned to bring out the new Politika.",

      "bodyText": "The ban on stag hunting will continue on National Trust lands, the organisation's ruling council has decided after considering the Burns report on hunting. The decision ends the last hope of the deer hunts in the West Country to overturn the trust's ban, introduced in 1997 after an earlier report had condemned the sport as cruel. Since then the hunters have taken on the trust in a protracted high court battle and commissioned their own study to try to show that the science in the original Bateson report on cruelty was flawed. Each time the trust has remained unmoved, but its council said in January that it would keep an open mind on new evidence and would consider the government-commissioned Burns report. This report looked at the social, economic, conservation and animal welfare aspects of a ban on hunting with hounds, but the trust decided yesterday that the report did not alter the basis on which it had developed its field sports policy. Stag hunting remains banned but other field sports including fox hunting, shooting and fishing can continue, unless the government bans them. In the statement the council said: \"The National Trust is very much aware of the importance of countryside traditions. \"It allows field sports to take place on its property where traditionally practised, providing they are within the law and are compatible with the trust's purposes, which include public access and the protection of rare animals and birds and fragile habitats. \"The trust is a charitable body, and as such cannot take a political position either for or against field sports.\" Relations with the stag hunting fraternity have continued to deteriorate since the ban, with allegations that the hunters have been trespassing on trust land. Ten days ago the master of the Quantock staghounds, Paddy Groves, was forced to apologise to the trust and give a written undertaking that the Quantock staghounds would not trespass in future. The apology followed a trespass at Shervage wood in Somerset on September 4, when the International Fund for Animal Welfare videoed the hunt and provided evidence that the Quantock staghounds had broken the ban. The trust consulted its lawyers and would have taken the hunt to court seeking an injunction to prevent another trespass if it had not received an apology and an undertaking it would not happen again. The trust said at the time: \"We have taken this firm and decisive action to protect the welfare of the red deer on our land.\" Yesterday a spokesman in London said the trust hoped that the battle over hunting was now entirely a matter for the government.",

Mr Cook, euphoric over this week's ousting of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, said that while European spending ministers were re luctant to part with cash, substantial amounts had already been budgeted within the EU for helping Serbia, which with Montenegro makes up Yugoslavia. He said: \"It is important that we get some visible projects to demonstrate to the people of Serbia that things are now different.\" Top of his list was opening up the Danube for navigation.

The UN-imposed arms embargo can be ended only by a UN security council resolution. Monday's Luxembourg meeting is also expected to consider freeing up 2.3bn euros (currently \u00a31.3bn) in economic aid which the EU had earmarked for Serbia in the next seven years if Mr Milosevic was thrown out. The fear in Serbia's secessionist province of Kosovo is that western attention and cash will switch to Serbia proper, but Mr Patten said: \"There cannot be any question of us trying to pay for what will be needed in Serbia out of what is being done for the Balkans as a whole.\" Bernard Kouchner, the United Nations administrator in Kosovo, urged the international community not to be \"diverted from the tasks at hand here in Kosovo\".

In one poem, Paunescu wrote: \"It is Ceausescu himself that introduced honour within the Communist party and the country/He rediscovered our history unadulterated to make us reach for the future in our dreams.\" A StAnza organiser, Brian Johnstone, said Paunescu would play a small part in the four-day event. \"This is a poetry festival; people are here because they are interested in his poems and not in his political leanings.\" Others view Paunescu's inclusion as an affront. Since 1989 he has been a journalist, a children's author and a politician known for his nationalist and anti-western views. \"Paunescu wrote sycophantic odes about Ceausescu and organised mass rallies at which young people were dragooned into praising the dictator,\" said Tom Gallagher, author of Romania After Ceausescu. \"Paunescu was a cultural commissar for the regime and he did very well out of it.\" Amnesty International said it had no evidence, however, that the poet was involved in human rights violations. Another StAnza organiser, Gavin Bowd, said: \"Paunescu had an ambivalent relationship with the regime, but so did most intellectuals and this is now 10 years ago.\"",

His \u00a34m racing catamaran Team Philips lasted only 18 hours on a transatlantic trial voyage to New York. Then it had to limp back to Dartmouth, Devon, after a swaying movement in one of its masts aroused concern. It was a second setback for Goss, who with a four-man crew is testing the vessel to compete in The Race, a non-stop round-the-world dash which starts from Barcelona on December 31. The race crosses some of the world's most battering waters in the south Atlantic. If it is to compete, the catamaran has to be in Monaco by December to take part in a prologue to the event. The embarrassment follows an earlier near-disaster on March 29 off the Isles of Scilly, when 40ft of the craft's port bow snapped off during initial sea trials, crippling the vessel. The latest trial was planned to give the hi-tech Team Philips its toughest outing since then. Before setting off for New York, Goss called his departure \"judgment day\".

But on Thursday night the good citizens of Danville were treated to what was described by the CBS commentator Dan Rather as the best vice-presidential debate ever to have taken place. While this may seem to be damning with faint praise, the debate between Joe Lieberman and Dick Cheney at the Centre College was certainly livelier and better humoured than that of their presidential counterparts two days earlier. Again, no knock-out blow was delivered, but Mr Cheney gave the more self-confident and assured performance and even managed to lighten his image with some jokes. Commentators generally felt that the Republican candidate had managed to humanise himself and catch up with Mr Lieberman in the personal popularity stakes without necessarily swinging many votes. Mr Lieberman started and ended by invoking his parents. He said that his 85-year-old mother had told him before the debate: \"Sweetheart, be positive and remember that I will love you no matter what your opponent says about you.\" He closed with a tearful reference to his late father, who had once worked night shifts on a bakery truck, and had taught that \"in America, if you have faith and work hard and play by the rules there is nothing you cannot achieve\". Mr Cheney won some laughs in response to a tease from Mr Lieberman about how much better off he was after eight years of the Democrats - a reference to the millions Mr Cheney has made in the private sector. \"I can tell you, Joe, that the government had absolutely nothing to do with it,\" he said. Mr Lieberman said that he could see his wife in the audience and thought she must be wishing that he, too, would go into the private sector. \"I'm going to try and help you do that, Joe,\" Mr Cheney said. They were asked by the moderator, Bernard Shaw, an African-American, to imagine themselves as black and to say what they would feel about being stopped by the police purely because of their colour. Mr Lieberman said it made him want to \"hit the wall... we can't tolerate it any more\". Mr Cheney, who quoted Martin Luther King, said it \"would make me extraordinarily angry\", but said he would find it hard, as someone who had always been part of the majority, to understand properly what the experience was of a minority. On the issue of gay rights and gay marriages, Mr Lieberman said that gay people were \"as much children of the same awesome God as any of the rest of us\", and he had an open mind on the issue of gay unions because he had friends in gay or lesbian partnerships who had pointed out \"elements of unfairness\". Mr Cheney said: \"We live in a free society and freedom means freedom for everybody... it's really no one else's business.\" He added, \"I try to be open-minded about it as much as I can,\" and said he felt it was up to each state to decide how relationships were recognised. Both eschewed personal attacks until the end of the 90-minute debate, when Mr Cheney took a sideswipe at Mr Lieberman for attending a Hollywood fundraiser at which a comedian made a joke about George W Bush's religion. Mr Lieberman, who made frequent references to God - almost as frequent as his 18 references to \"Al Gore and I\" - deplored the joke but refrained from making any cracks about Mr Cheney. Each referred to the other by his first name throughout and they paid fulsome compliments to one another. While Mr Rather said that it was perhaps not a debate to listen to if you were operating heavy machinery, the general response was that it had been civilised, that it had shown Mr Cheney to be less of a conservative hardliner than his image, and had emphasised Mr Lieberman's tendency to make jokes to defuse a situation.

      "bodyText": "The role of second banana in the presidential race is a tricky one. While an imaginative choice of running mate may add bounce to a campaign, there is always the danger of a skeleton lurking in the closet. The two vice-presidential candidates squared up on Thursday night with Joe Lieberman ahead of Dick Cheney in the battle for votes. Such had been the lacklustre performance of Mr Cheney up to then that a mischievous \"urban myth\" email had been suggesting that there were plans for him to withdraw from the race on health grounds and be replaced by Colin Powell or John McCain. When Mr Lieberman was chosen, the focus was on the fact that he had been the most prominent Democrat in attacking the conduct of President Clinton in the Lewinsky affair. He was also known as a critic of violence and sex in entertainment and as someone who spoke often of his Jewish faith. The Gore team, in wooing the African-American vote, was also relieved to discover that as a 21-year-old student at Yale in 1963 Mr Lieberman had travelled to Mississippi to campaign for the rights of black voters. He has proved a major plus for the Gore team and, so far, he has passed the financial test which so many of his predecessors failed. His personal accounts show that his and his wife's income last year was $336,201 and that he paid 23.5% income tax. Around 3% of their income goes to charity. But Mr Lieberman has come under fire for continuing to stand for his Senate seat which, if elected vice-president, he would not be able to take up. In contrast, although Mr Cheney's roles as White House chief of staff and defence secretary during 25 years in Washington gave the Bush ticket the bottom it had been lacking, this initial advantage appeared to wear off swiftly. It emerged that he had often not bothered to vote in Texas elections; he received flak for praising Opec for driving up the price of oil in his role as chief executive of an energy services company, Halliburton; and his income of $4,423,289 last year was rather more difficult for the average American to digest. Even more spectacularly, Mr Cheney went on to cash in his stake in Halliburton and make a $20.6m profit.",

      "bodyText": "Essex health authorities waited more than six months before telling 5,000 patients by letter yesterday of a small risk that they might have been infected with HIV during treatment at dental surgeries in three of the county's main towns. Public health officials said they had decided against making an earlier announcement because they wanted first to mount \"a major look-back exercise\" to identify all the patients who had come into contact with the infected health worker over the previous 12 years. Paul Watson, director of public health for north Essex, said the operation to check rigorously through the relevant dental practice records was the biggest of its kind undertaken in Britain. The north Essex and south Essex authorities were told in March that a healthcare worker looking after patients at surgeries in Colchester, Clacton and Southend had tested positive for HIV. They said the person had stopped working immediately after the diagnosis, and they insisted that the risk of patients becoming infected with HIV was very small. No information is being disclosed about whether the individual was a man or woman, or a dentist, dental nurse, hygienist or anaesthetist. \"Had we made an announcement in March that would have caused a lot of worry to a huge number of people,\" Dr Watson said. \"We are expecting thousands of people to call our helpline, afraid that they might have been affected. Had we made an announcement in March that number could have run into millions and caused a lot of unnecessary panic.\" But the decision was causing concern among some local doctors. One said it was \"a complete breach of trust\", asserting that the public had the right to know immediately if they had been exposed to the virus. \"I would expect the authority to inform patients at the surgeries that they may be at risk immediately. By waiting this long, they are only going to cause more panic and concern,\" he said. A non-official source at north Essex health authority said: \"We have been overwhelmed by the number of calls. People are naturally very concerned.\" Dr Watson said the chances of patients being infected with HIV while they received treatment were \"minuscule, but we do feel that people should be informed and offered a confidential test if they want it\". In north Essex about 5,000 patients were notified by letters posted on Thursday. Helplines were set up offering counselling and the opportunity to take a simple saliva test for HIV. In south Essex nearly 100 people were notified and offered the same facilities. Defending the time taken to notify patients, Dr Watson said: \"It has taken this long to set up the exercise and search through records to find patients who might have come into contact with this worker.\" It was \"the biggest look-back exercise\" involving a health care worker with HIV. Dr Watson said there was nothing to suggest that the worker had not taken normal precautions against infecting patients, such as wearing rubber gloves. Bryan Harvey, chairman of the south Essex local dental committee, said any patient who had concerns about dental work should consult their dentist. \"The question will be asked, is it safe to go to the dentist? The answer is that it is. All healthcare workers in dental practice work to professional regulations and high standards of infection-control procedures. These are universal precautions.

Then the chatline coordinator announces that the site has only received 400 hits. \"That's not good,\" Mr Walesa says, shaking his head. \"Am I wasting my time?\" It is the last day of campaigning in the Polish presidential election and - despite having secured a hero's place in European history as the leader of the Solidarity movement, which took Poland out of communism and into democracy - Mr Walesa is not satisfied enough to sit back, whatever he may say about fishing. Rather, he hopes the election will restore his past glories by making him president for the second time. But the former Gdansk shipyard electrician is almost certain to go down to a humiliating defeat. Standing under the slogan \"Black is black and white is white\" (black symbolising the ex-communists in power), Mr Walesa, 57, says he is driven by the stubborn belief that he can reshape Polish life. \"I owe a lot to the nation,\" he says. \"When the country is in trouble, as it is now, I must put myself at the people's disposal.

But it has been peppered with western-style dirty tricks, mainly thanks to Marian Krzaklewski, 50, the candidate from the Solidarity-AWS alliance of trade unions and Catholic parties who is widely considered to be the brains behind the government. Despite Mr Walesa's claim that he is \"still my friend\", Mr Krzaklewski is one of the politicians responsible for squeezing Mr Walesa out of the Solidarity bloc. In August there was brief excitement when they had to defend themselves in a Warsaw court after rivals accused them of having collaborated with the communist secret police. Both were cleared. Last month Mr Kwasniewski suffered a blow which some believed might fell him, when his campaign broadcast showed his national security adviser, Marek Siwiec, parodying the Pope by kissing the soil as he left a helicopter during a 1997 presidential trip. It upset much of the electorate in the predominantly Roman Catholic country and, as Mr Siwiec's boss Mr Kwasniewski suffered a drop of 5-10 percentage points in his popular support. Despite such setbacks, the only unknown in tomorrow's vote is how big tMr Kwasniewski's victory will be over the 11 rightwing and centrist candidates. Much of the success of the communist-turned-social democrat - described by Mr Walesa as a \"well dressed scarecrow who uses Goebbels-style techniques\" - is put down to his ability to epitomise modern Poland. In 1995 image makers from Poland and France were recruited to dress him in designer suits, polish up his communication skills and turn him into one of central Europe's first US-style politicians. Post-communist Poland likes style and aspires to success. \"Kwasniewski is slick, funny and speaks foreign languages, as opposed to Walesa, who wears scuffed shoes and speaks awful Polish,\" says Malgorzata Jatkowska, 30, a film school student at Lodz in central Poland. Respect still attaches to Mr Walesa's past role, but today he is seen as too dogmatic and haphazard. \"Churchill was a good wartime leader, but proved hopeless in peace time, and it's the same with Walesa,\" said a bookseller in Warsaw. But Mr Walesa says he has not yet had a chance to prove what he can do. \"I always expected I'd be elected for a second term,\" he says. \"So I've only realised half my plan and there is still a lot of evil to get rid of.\"",

She was diagnosed with breast cancer by Sir Colin in 1986 and also had a double mastectomy. A checkup in 1994 revealed she did not have the disease. Mrs Cormack's sister was diagnosed with breast cancer in the same month as she received her erroneous biopsy results. For three years Mrs Cormack, who is married with two children, tended to her sister. \"All the time I was looking after her and watching her slip away I was thinking, 'This is me next.'\" Mrs Cormack is now a counsellor with a breast cancer charity. \"I had a great determination not to let this thing warp me. Working as a volunteer has helped,\" she said. \"My family and friends have all learned that life is a one-stop, it's not a rehearsal. You have to take your chances while you can. And always get a second opinion.\"",

The report by the interim chief executive of the Scottish qualifications authority found that some SQA staff were not trained and there were allegations of bullying. The SQA was responsible for collating and distributing results for the 147,000 pupils who took exams in Scotland this year. But thousands of youngsters were sent incomplete or inaccurate grades and the validity of all results for the class of 2000 has been thrown into doubt. In written evidence to an inquiry set up by the Scottish parliament's education committee, Bill Morton, who was appointed as acting SQA chief executive after the scandal broke, said management of the authority was poor. There was little accountability or communication, some staff had not been properly trained , others did not know how to respond to customer needs, and there was evidence of concern about bullying. He said his internal inquiry into the problems also found poor administration of marking - although the quality assurance of the marking was said to be \"robust\" - and inadequate planning, preparation and project management. There was, said Mr Morton, little evidence of checks to prevent errors and omissions, with ad hoc solutions being attempted as successive problems appeared, and there was a clear lack of communication within the body. Mr Morton said staff concerns about difficulties were not acted upon effectively or on time and he found evidence of a fear of bullying among workers. He told MSPs that he had been forced to make key changes because of the seriousness and scale of the problem, and further fundamental changes were in the pipeline. The Scottish National party's education spokesman, Mike Russell, said the report put further pressure on the Scottish exective and the education minister, Sam Galbraith, to explain their role in the fiasco. Mr Galbraith has insisted that he was not aware of the extent of problems in the SQA despite repeated requests for information. \"Mr Morton has found an organsation in deep trouble and it is unlikely that this situation arose overnight,\" he said. \"Why was an organisation that was supposed to be the gold standard for Scottish education allowed to get into such a state? \"Was the education minister informed?

So what is the true state of affairs?</p> <p>Labour calculates there is a \u00a316bn hole in the Tory spending plans, equivalent to \u00a3600 for every taxpayer in Britain. Gordon Brown intends to increase public spending by 3.25% a year between 2001-02 and 2003-04, spending over the period a total of \u00a3439.6bn. By contrast, Labour says Mr Portillo is on record as saying that he would restrict increases in spending to below the trend rate of growth in the economy - which, the government says, would result in \u00a3423.9bn having been spent at the end of this three-year period. Ergo, says Labour, the Tories would \"cut\" \u00a316bn.</p> <p>But Labour makes certain assumptions. The first is the trend rate of growth (an assessment of the average increase in gross domestic product over many decades) the Conservatives would use as their benchmark. Based on remarks made in the summer, Labour assumes the Conservatives believe the trend rate is just over 2%, but neither Mr Portillo nor William Hague has been specific.</p> <p>The government itself is in two minds about the trend rate.

The government is assuming Mr Portillo starts to cut from the moment he walks in to the Treasury, but this would be difficult given that the 2001-02 financial year will have begun next April. It would cause havoc to government departments to announce spending cuts when money was already budgeted for, and Mr Portillo would almost certainly wait until 2002-03 before wielding the axe.</p> <p>So, assuming the Conservatives spend at the same rate as Labour in the first year and then increase spending by 2.5% a year rather than 2%, what would be the difference between the two programmes? By 2003-04, the final year of Mr Brown's three-year plan, the Tories would be spending \u00a3433.2bn as opposed to the government's \u00a3439.6bn - a difference of \u00a36.4bn rather than \u00a316bn. If he increased spending at 2.25% the shortfall would be \u00a38.5bn.</p> <p>In the context of the public finances, both of these figures represent small change. The gap is so small, and the projected size of the government's surplus (set to be \u00a315bn this year) is so big, that Mr Portillo might not need to make any cuts at all, unless he wanted to. In fact, the Tories, given their pronouncements on the desirability of lower taxes, would probably have to spend less than Labour overall.</p> <p>Mr Portillo has agreed to match Labour's spending on the NHS and on pensions - two of the government's biggest items of expenditure. Labour also says the Conservatives have been \"spraying around\" spending commitments for 8,000 soldiers, 18,000 more in the territorial army, abolition of the early release scheme for prisoners, new housing grants, new right-to-buy discounts for council houses, new link roads, more trains on Sundays, endowments for universities, extra police, the restoration of the assisted places scheme, and boosting annuities for pensioners. Whether these are additional to, or substitutes for, existing programmes has yet to be made clear.</p> <p>But the Conservative approach is far less disciplined than the regime Mr Brown imposed on Labour before the 1997 election. Millbank intends to spend the next weeks and months meticulously costing every pledge.</p> <p>Mr Portillo has only a limited range of options for reducing spending to make room for extra commitments. He is unlikely to want to cut the politically sensitive education budget or defence. That leaves transport infrastructure, social security other than pensions, and eliminating bureaucracy and fraud, as candidates for saving serious amounts of money.</p> <p>Some of the money saved will also be earmarked for the tax cuts promised this week by Mr Portillo. In his speech he said he would cut taxes on business, restore the married couples allowance, cut the duty on fuel, help pensioners and hard working families, encourage savings, and reform taxes on entrepreneurs and inward investment.</p> <p>Of these, only fuel duty has been fleshed out, with the 3p a litre cut pledged by Mr Hague likely to cost \u00a31.1bn in the first year. But restoration of the married couples allowance at its level before Mr Brown abolished it this year would cost a further \u00a32bn. If Mr Portillo wanted a 1p cut in the basic income tax, that would cost a further \u00a33bn.</p> <p>The more Mr Portillo spends on tax cuts, the more he will have to save elsewhere. That is not to say there will not be room for any tax cuts - as Mr Brown will almost certainly demonstrate next March, the health of the public finances is such that it is possible to maintain spending and make modest tax cuts.</p> <p>But cutting taxes and increasing spending may come at the cost of higher interest rates.

      "bodyText": "Frank Sinatra's youngest daughter presents the United States tomorrow with a snapshot of an era in which presidential election campaigns took a more relaxed view about where their funds came from than the Gore and Bush teams of today. Tina Sinatra says that her father, one of the most reliable targets each time the world goes looking for a tarnished hero, acted as a facilitator when John F Kennedy's election machine realised it could use a little help from the Mafia 40 years ago. The singer, whose job as a go-between was set up by the Kennedy family patriarch Joseph, asked the Chicago crime overlord Sam Giancana to use the mob's muscle to deliver union votes. It was thought to be \"in Jack Kennedy's best interest if his father did not make the contact directly\", Ms Sinatra, 52, told the CBS current affairs programme 60 Minutes. \"Dad was on an errand.\" Sinatra, who died two years ago at the age of 82, received the call when JFK, then a member of the Senate, was fighting Hubert Humphrey for the Democratic nomination to run as president in 1960. His father believed that Giancana's influence could make the difference in the West Virginia primary. Sinatra was chosen for the task \"because Kennedy knew dad had access to Sam Giancana\", his daughter said. The Mafia boss agreed to help, indicating that it was all in a day's work for him. \"It's a couple of calls,\" he said. But Giancana felt betrayed after Kennedy won the primary and then the the White House, and his brother Robert, the attorney general, turned against organised crime. Ms Sinatra said: \"Sam was saying 'That's not right. You know he owes me' - he meaning Joe Kennedy. And dad, I think, said 'No, I owe you. I asked for the favour'.\" Her father repaid his debt to Giancana by agreeing to play the mobster's Chicago club, the Villa Venice, and made the apology more fulsome by bringing along Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin for an eight-night engagement. Subsequently, the president, the performer and the persistent criminal were linked through the late Judith Exner, who had affairs with all three. Sinatra said that contact with underworld elements was all a part of the entertainment industry. \"In theatrical work, in night club work, in concerts,\" he told an interviewer. \"In restaurants you meet all kinds of people, so that there's really not much to be said about that.

Only the day before three bodies had been removed from a woodshed in the back garden of a property two doors away from the home she has shared with her husband Jack for almost 20 years. Like others in the west Cornwall hamlet of Carnkie, she was barely able to comprehend what was taking place around her. Now in her 70s, she has no grandchildren of her own. Had she been blessed with any, she would have liked them to be like the \"nice kids\" from the nearby property who used to say hello to her and Jack when they went outside. Now, she is having to come to terms with radio reports of their deaths. \"It has not sunk in yet but we are all feeling very bad,\" she said yesterday as police forensic experts clothed in white boilersuits began to wind up their search of the pre-fabricated bungalow where Lesley Ford lived with her four teenage children and the two younger children from her second marriage. On the verge outside the rented property to which the Fords moved two years ago, a bunch of freshly picked sunflowers and two bouquets wrapped in cellophane provided the first outward sign of the community's despair at what has happened. Carnkie, a rural hamlet of some 70 houses a few miles from Helston, has little in the way of public amenities to call its own. But in the bar of the Wendron cricket and football club, the mood was subdued yesterday. Club stewardess Julie Kirk, who moved to the area only a couple of months ago, said people in the village were \"absolutely devastated\" about what they had heard. The pain has been particularly hard to bear at Helston school, Cornwall's largest, where three of Mrs Ford's children - Craig, 13, Steven, 14, and Anne-Marie, 16, were pupils - and where 17-year-old Sarah-Jane spent a term before leaving school and starting a job in a nearby McDonald's restaurant. Headteacher Dennis Johnson said staff and students had been profoundly shocked by news of the tragedy and were being offered counselling by the local authority. Paul Pullen, a local priest, said the clergy stood ready to offer any pastoral care local people wanted: \"The community is in shock and it will take some time for people to come to terms with this.\" Mrs Ford and the four children disappeared from their home in Carnkie more than a month ago but were not reported missing until last week when Mrs Ford's brother, who lives in Hampshire, raised the alarm. Three bodies were discovered on Wednesday in a shed in the garden of their home. Two more were recovered yesterday after a police search of a field at Treluswell, about six miles away. Lesley Ford's parents, who live in Newquay, Cornwall, said they were devastated by what had happened. \"We are reeling, we can't understand it,\" her father, Leslie Wyatt, said last night. In Shropshire, where Mrs Ford's two youngest children are being looked after by relatives, her distraught former husband, Michael Tranter, was being comforted by family and friends at his Telford home. The Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives, Andrew George, said he knew how close-knit the community was in that area. \"It will take years for the wider community to come to terms with the fact that something so shocking and unbelievable could happen in their midst.\" \u0095A 33-year-old man appeared in court at Truro yesterday charged with the murders of his wife and his four stepchildren. Lee Ford, of Carnkie, was charged with murdering Lesley Ford, 36, Sarah-Jane Tranter, 17, Ann-Marie Tranter, 16, Steven Tranter, 14, and Craig Tranter, 13, between August 26 and October 5. He was remanded in custody for a week.",

      "bodyText": "Japan cautiously celebrated a narrow escape yesterday after one of its biggest earthquakes in decades tore up buildings and roads but amazingly did not take a single life. The tremor, which struck Tottori prefecture in western Japan, registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, making it more powerful than the 7.2 Kobe quake which killed more than 6,000 people in 1995. Thirty-six people were injured as the tremor rippled half the length of Japan, sending skyscrapers swaying in Tokyo, more than 370 miles to the north-east. The worst hit places were rural communities in and around Minato, the town nearest to the epicentre. More than 190 homes were destroyed, forcing more than 430 refugees to bed down last night in schools and community centres. \"I've never experienced such a terrifying earthquake in my life,\" a local shopowner said in a television interview. \"I grabbed a customer and held on to her as we cowered on the floor.\" The quake triggered about a dozen landslides, halted train services and blocked roads. In some parts of this mountainous region huge boulders tumbled down on to the roads - fortunately when there was no traffic. Elsewhere there was a catalogue of near misses. Road surfaces cracked and buckled, but no accidents were reported, and bridges swayed: in Okayama one was reported to have collapsed and been swept away. In Saihaku village the heavy tiled roof of a shrine collapsed but the two people inside escaped with injuries. At a construction site in Shimane prefecture two people buried in a landslide were rescued alive. Power cuts, gas leaks and burst gas pipes were also dealt with before anyone was hurt. The biggest escape, however, may have been at two nuclear reactors, just 12 miles from the epicentre, which happened to be shut down for routine checks when the quake hit. Part of the credit for the low number of casualties must go to the authorities, who responded rapidly, in sharp contrast to the blundering delays which worsened the death toll in Kobe five years ago. Within an hour the cabinet had established a crisis-management taskforce and the defence forces had sent planes to make an aerial examination. No emergency action was required, however, prompting a collective sigh of relief from the government. \"We must be thankful that there have been no reports of fatalities,\" the prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, said. \"When you consider the immense size of the earthquake, the damage so far has been small.\" Seismologists were still analysing the data last night to determine why Tottori had been able to escape so lightly. The fact that the quake hit a sparsely populated region in the afternoon was cited as a key factor. This was in contrast to the Kobe quake, which struck early in the morning, killing many people in their beds. It was also speculated that the movement of the quake was mostly horizontal, which sets buildings swaying, rather than the lethal vertical shaking that jolted Kobe. The authorities warned, however, that is was too early to declare an all clear. Aftershocks were still rocking Tottori and the surrounding areas yesterday and the meteorological agency warned that there was a 40% chance of another powerful quake in the next 24 hours. The Japanese need little reminding of the dangers. The country, which sits on the juncture of three tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active in the world. This year the archipelago has been shaken by an unusual number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, prompting the fear that a major movement of the plates in the Earth's crust is taking place.",

      "body": "<p>Late one night, many years ago, a bunch of undergraduates were staggering out of a Scottish university students' union after having had too much to drink. We passed a fellow student who fitted the archetype of the \"queer\", standing by himself. My pal Harry made noisy kissing sounds in his direction and shouted, \"Coming out with me tonight, sister?\" We rolled on down the hill laughing. A few days later I noticed this same man, alone at a table close to ours in the union bar. Suddenly one of our group turned to look directly at him and said, \"I hate fucking perverts, don't you?\"</p> <p>I felt horrified and sick with apprehension - as I suspect this man did, for he got up at once and left the bar. It hit me at once that the gap between this outburst and Harry's drunken remark was small. I was 19 and began to ponder seriously who is and is not my neighbour.</p> <p>That was in the 1950s, when homosexuals had not yet acquired the self-description of gay. The dictionary connotations of the word queer are odd, singular, quaint, open to suspicion, counterfeit, slightly mad, and sickly. This queerness has obviously proved unnerving for many heterosexuals who tend to be afraid of gay people, seen as strangers in our midst. Hence the persecution and, I suppose, the negative biblical references to homosexuality. What am I to make of this as a committed Catholic who just happens to be heterosexual?</p> <p>There is no New Testament record of Jesus mentioning homosexuality. We do know that the scorned and outcast were the kinds of people he particularly cared about and wanted to be with. To me that implies something warmer than mere tolerance.</p> <p>The tone of Vatican teaching is at best reluctantly tolerant. Cardinal Ratzinger's October 1986 Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons said that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\" Homosexual actions are \"in no case to be approved of.\" Since my homosexual friends are on the whole living decent, loving and even admirably religious lives with their partners, I know I could not look them in the eye and repeat this instruction.</p> <p>The Pontifical Council's 1996 document, The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education Within the Family, is made of still sterner stuff. At a time when we have no certainty about the causes of homosexuality, it considers subjecting young people to therapy to change their sexual orientation.</p> <p>One of my students has catalogued the suggestions therapists have made about appropriate methodologies. They include \"exercise to exhaustion; sleeping with prostitutes; electric shock aversion; chemical aversion through nausea inducing drugs; covert sensitisation through reshaping masturbatory fantasies; psychoanalysis.\" I wonder which of these the Pontifical Council has in mind?</p> <p>Martin Pendergast, a member of the Roman Catholic caucus in the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement since 1976, told me how homosexual Catholics often have the literal experience of being treated like strangers in their own church. They feel that there is \"a dogged rejection of real dialogue with lesbian, gay and bisexual people, their parents and families, over the honourable integration of diverse sexual orientations, and their expression, with Christian faith.\"</p> <p>They even feel that this carelessness amounts to a tacit acceptance of the daily bullying, persecution and in recent times even bombing, that gay people suffer. How can it be otherwise when Catholic clergy of goodwill - and there are many- struggle with the tension between the alienating language of Vatican statements and the realities they meet every day?</p> <p>I did learn something from the oppression I once colluded in. It is to do with the mercy of God. Religious people can choose to ignore that and rest inertly upon cultural norms that are so long-standing that they appear to be self-evident. This leads to a forgetfulness of the humanity and goodness of people who find themselves unable to abide by those norms. Sheer lack of awareness leads to a passive and undiscriminating emphasis on the norms while sanctioning blindness to the needs of our neighbours.</p> <p>Passing by on the other side won't do: not on the streets of Scotland, any more than on the road to Jericho.</p> <p>\u0095 Dr David Hay is a former reader in spiritual education at Nottingham University</p>",

Suddenly one of our group turned to look directly at him and said, \"I hate fucking perverts, don't you?\" I felt horrified and sick with apprehension - as I suspect this man did, for he got up at once and left the bar. It hit me at once that the gap between this outburst and Harry's drunken remark was small. I was 19 and began to ponder seriously who is and is not my neighbour. That was in the 1950s, when homosexuals had not yet acquired the self-description of gay. The dictionary connotations of the word queer are odd, singular, quaint, open to suspicion, counterfeit, slightly mad, and sickly. This queerness has obviously proved unnerving for many heterosexuals who tend to be afraid of gay people, seen as strangers in our midst. Hence the persecution and, I suppose, the negative biblical references to homosexuality. What am I to make of this as a committed Catholic who just happens to be heterosexual? There is no New Testament record of Jesus mentioning homosexuality. We do know that the scorned and outcast were the kinds of people he particularly cared about and wanted to be with. To me that implies something warmer than mere tolerance. The tone of Vatican teaching is at best reluctantly tolerant. Cardinal Ratzinger's October 1986 Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons said that \"although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\" Homosexual actions are \"in no case to be approved of.\" Since my homosexual friends are on the whole living decent, loving and even admirably religious lives with their partners, I know I could not look them in the eye and repeat this instruction. The Pontifical Council's 1996 document, The Truth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines for Education Within the Family, is made of still sterner stuff. At a time when we have no certainty about the causes of homosexuality, it considers subjecting young people to therapy to change their sexual orientation. One of my students has catalogued the suggestions therapists have made about appropriate methodologies. They include \"exercise to exhaustion; sleeping with prostitutes; electric shock aversion; chemical aversion through nausea inducing drugs; covert sensitisation through reshaping masturbatory fantasies; psychoanalysis.\" I wonder which of these the Pontifical Council has in mind? Martin Pendergast, a member of the Roman Catholic caucus in the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement since 1976, told me how homosexual Catholics often have the literal experience of being treated like strangers in their own church. They feel that there is \"a dogged rejection of real dialogue with lesbian, gay and bisexual people, their parents and families, over the honourable integration of diverse sexual orientations, and their expression, with Christian faith.\" They even feel that this carelessness amounts to a tacit acceptance of the daily bullying, persecution and in recent times even bombing, that gay people suffer. How can it be otherwise when Catholic clergy of goodwill - and there are many- struggle with the tension between the alienating language of Vatican statements and the realities they meet every day? I did learn something from the oppression I once colluded in. It is to do with the mercy of God. Religious people can choose to ignore that and rest inertly upon cultural norms that are so long-standing that they appear to be self-evident. This leads to a forgetfulness of the humanity and goodness of people who find themselves unable to abide by those norms. Sheer lack of awareness leads to a passive and undiscriminating emphasis on the norms while sanctioning blindness to the needs of our neighbours. Passing by on the other side won't do: not on the streets of Scotland, any more than on the road to Jericho. \u0095 Dr David Hay is a former reader in spiritual education at Nottingham University",

      "bodyText": "Shares in beleagured computer games company Eidos suffered a further battering yesterday following the resignation of its finance chief and increased speculation that a takeover bid for the company is on the verge of collapse. The unexpected announcement that chief financial officer Jeremy Lewis had quit with immediate effect to \"pursue other interests\" has intensified a feeling among analysts that long-running takeover talks with Infogrames of France may end in deadlock. Shares in Eidos slumped 15% in early trading and later closed down 12.75p at 294.5p, around one-fifth of the year high of \u00a312.90p. Eidos and Infogrames have been arguing about the terms of a deal since June 20, when the French firm first indicated that it was interested in making an offer for Eidos. Mr Lewis' sudden departure and chief operating officer Mike McGarvey's admission that Eidos would now look for a finance chief with operational experience to help it through the slump in its busi ness led some analysts to suggest the deal was off, and that Eidos was preparing for life as an independent entity. Eidos sources insisted that former corporate financier Mr Lewis was not leaving because of anything \"sinister\" inside the company. \"The straightforward truth is that Jeremy has a deal-making background and came into the company when we were making acquisitions and our growth cycle was at a different stage,\" Mr McGarvey said. \"We will look for a more operationally focused finance director and focus inwards on controls, systems and overheads.\" Sources close to Eidos admitted that losing Mr Lewis in the middle of takeover talks was far from ideal and would add to negative sentiment over the company in the City. Eidos has been hit by successive profit warnings this year following falling sales of its Tombraider franchise and slowing demand for games as consumers waited for the introduction of new consoles. Its shares fell sharply again last month when Sony admitted to a shortfall in supply of its PlayStation 2.",

The US economy has been expanding for more than nine years with few signs of inflation - partly as a result of ris ing hi-tech productivity. \"This has been a good day for those of us sympathetic to the notion that the 'new economy' effects are crossing the Atlantic,\" said Ciaran Barr, UK economist at Deutsche Bank. The ONS said it had revised upwards its estimates of annual trend growth in manufacturing to 1.5% - and analysts said that despite gloomy headlines there were signs that the sector was returning to health after the last year's mini-recession. \"I think the story throughout this year is that the underlying picture on manufacturing has been better than a lot of the press stories would suggest,\" said Ian Stewart, an economist with the investment bank, Merrill Lynch. \"If you look at the more forward looking indicators from the CBI and the PMI, [Purchasing Managers Index] the order books have weakened, but they certainly have not collapsed and the general picture is one of sluggish but still positive output growth.\" \u0095 Mobile phone operator Orange plans to create 1,500 jobs with the opening of a second customer services centre in north Tyneside. The \u00a315m centre is due to open next August.",

Compel itself said last month that the market for reselling remains weak and expenditure on IT in general remains depressed. Low margins and revenue growth in the reselling industry make consolidation likely in the long run and Computacenter may play a leading part in this. For now though it should concentrate on its core business. Investors appear to have two options. Those prepared to gamble on a potential spin off of Biomi, Computacenter's e-procurement business, securing a rumoured \u00a3600m valuation could find the remainder of the business valued very cheaply. Merrill Lynch says it would leave the core business trading on just 7.6 times 2000 earnings. In that event the stock could be a trading buy. For the more risk-averse the more sensible route is to hold. This is a market that will recover slowly and could still generate further disappointment. Windows 2000 sales are not likely to affect hardware revenues until next year. Computacenter lacks scale in Europe and is still loss making. The shares closed up 8.5p at 332.5p yesterday. The longer term future could be brighter though for those prepared to wait.",

The largest steel trimaran in the world, Triton was built at the Vosper Thornycroft shipyard in Southampton, where workers face the threat of redundancy through lack of contracts. It displaces 1,100 tonnes, cost \u00a313m to build and has a top speed of 20 knots. The design will be adopted for the new generation of Royal Navy frigates and destroyers if tests for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (Dera) are successful. Triton will be sailing in search of heavy seas to prove the advantage of the triple hull design.",

      "bodyText": "The Halifax yesterday signalled a sharp slowdown in house price inflation next year that will result in average price rises of around 4%. The bank said the slump in the growth of house prices this year would continue into 2001 following a marked decline in the London and south east property prices during the third quarter compared to last year. In the last quarter, the Halifax survey shows that house price inflation measured on a year-on-year basis in London was running at 13.2%, well below the 29.5% peak attained in the first quarter of this year. But the bank's figures were in contrast to the Nationwide building society survey published earlier this week which predicted a softer landing for the property market. The Nationwide survey pointed to a 5-7% rise in house prices next year, saying that prices would recover next spring. The average house price rose 1.1% in the third quarter to \u00a385,332. However, the annual rise of 8.1% was down from the annual rate of 11.3% posted in the second quarter. Earlier in the week the bank said a price rise in September of 1.6% was a blip. Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said: \"We expect annual house price growth to ease further in the coming quarters, led by a continuing slowdown in the south.\" Its regional breakdown of house prices for the third quarter showed there is still a sharp divide in prices between north and south. The Halifax found prices in the south of England, where prices have boomed over the last 18 months, remained much higher than those in the rest of the UK. The average price of a semi-detached house varied between \u00a3209,950 in Greater London to \u00a342,850 in Dyfed, Wales, the bank said. Prices in the north, which covers the north-east, have fallen by 1.3% over the past year while other areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, the north-west and Wales experienced modest rises. Wales and the north-west could join the north-east in registering an annual price drop if the cuts in prices during the last quarter of 2.1% and 0.3% respectively continue into next year as the Halifax predicts.",

We can remember the ads - Claudia Schiffer stripping off, all those gorgeous young couples having sex - but no one can ever recall which marques are being promoted.) </p> <p>Every year we spend a weekend with friends in Thorpeness, Suffolk, and we always go to the regular Sunday night family quiz. And every year the town seems to be racked with terrible rumours about people cheating. It was alleged darkly that one family, not knowing the patron saint of doctors, actually sent a child out to the tennis courts to ask a GP who was playing there. </p> <p>Another time the local MP, John Gummer, was accused of having three adults on his table instead of the maximum permitted two. I had reason to take him to lunch soon afterwards and began by saying that there was something important I had to ask him, and that if we cleared it out of the way we could relax and enjoy the lunch. He looked deeply worried, but when I told him of the charge he erupted in a fury. </p> <p>\"I did not cheat!\" he said. \"My poor wife Penny was not taking part in the quiz but she had to go and sit in the bar, on her own, because people kept talking loudly about how we were only allowed two adults, and I'm sick of it!\" But that's quizzes for you; they arouse huge passions and mighty resentments. </p> <p>Last year we took part in a junior school quiz. Next day a woman neighbour, who I know as a pleasant person, asked: \"Aren't you going to congratulate us on our success last night?\" I said I thought she'd only come fourth. \"But we beat you, and that's all that counts!\" she finished. </p> <p>\u0095 It was kind of so many of you to write, but I wish now I hadn't asked for help on the \"he is taller than me/I\" question. Along with quizzes, British people seem obsessed by grammar. I've had innumerable letters and emails, mostly good-humoured but in some cases surprisingly bitter, angry and prescriptive. And long. Heavens, you wouldn't believe how much people can write about two words, one of which is only one letter long. </p> <p>I'd say there was a narrow majority for the accusative case. Quite a lot of you think that \"he is taller than I\" sounds pretentious and clunky, even if it is technically correct. Others dispute even that, claiming that \"than I\", with an implied \"am\" at the end, is a grammarians' invention, dating from the time when they wanted to force the English language into Latin formulations. Another exam ple is the pointless banning of the split infinitive (though the most famous example of that, Star Trek's \"to boldly go\", sounds very peculiar to me. </p> <p>Several point out that our language owes as much to Norman French as to Latin, and the French would always use the strong accusative, \"toi\" and \"moi\". But either way, I shall continue using \"me\" and the correspondence is closed. </p> <p>\u0095 At a whisky reception the other day, I met a man with the splendid title of Professor the Lord Laird of Artigarvan. Even more resonant is his job description, printed on his card in what I thought was Gaelic, yet was instantly understandable: \"Heid-Yin o tha Boord o Ulster Scotch.\" Sadly it turns out to be some weird spoof language which doesn't exist. </p> <p> \u0095 No bore is worse than a football bore, so I'll keep this short. For someone who was raised in Leicester from the age of 13, and who walked to Filbert Street with his brother every fortnight through the season, it is highly gratifying to see Leicester City on top of the Premiership, even if none of the present team was born when I was a regular. Yes, I know it won't last - they play Manchester United in a week's time - and I know that they're thought dogged but dull. But please allow us our brief moment of glory. </p> <p>Lacking big money, Leicester have always had to rely on finding their own talent, including Gordon Banks, Gary Lineker and Emile Heskey. There was a fascinating table published this week showing which Premiership teams use the most foreigners. Chelsea were, of course, top with an average of 8.88 foreigners starting in each game. (Arsenal were second with 7.0). Leicester are comfortably bottom, using an average of only 0.88 foreigners at the beginning of each game. </p> <p>Perhaps if other clubs did a bit more nurturing at home, we might be facing today's game with Germany with a little more confidence. </p> <p>\u0095 The wine writer Tim Atkin was baffled the other day on a trip to Chablis. A Finnish writer on the trip remarked \"your cow is in the ditch\" and all the other Finns at the table fell about laughing. Apparently it means that you are caught between two stools. </p> <p>Tim reminds me of his favourite from the great New Statesman competition for meaningless saws: \"No leg is too short to reach the ground.\" I liked \"seek not the apple blossom upon the cherry tree\". Other examples, real or invented, are welcome. </p> <p>\u0095 At the British Council reception I chatted to Ffion Hague, who's on their board. I can see why the Tories wish she would do more public appearances. She is poised, witty, beautiful, has a lovely speaking voice, and possesses that remarkable gift some women have: she can make any man within 50 yards feel, for a few moments, that he is the most fascinating person in the world. Princess Di had the same knack, which is why weary old goats like me were so completely won over. </p> <p>I was in a group with my old friend John Cassidy, who comes from Leeds but now works for the New Yorker and is over here researching an article about William Hague. </p> <p>\"So we have an interest in common,\" he said to her, by way of small talk. </p> <p>\"Well, at least you don't have a haircut in common,\" Ffion said. </p> <p>\"So that's seen him off,\" I said, pointing to John, who has a perfectly normal bogbrush haircut. </p> <p>\"Oh, no,\" she said, genuinely worried that she'd caused offence. \"I was complimenting his haircut.\" </p> <p>Spelling it out in unnecessary detail, I said, \"so by implication...\" </p> <p>\"Yes!\" she said. No wonder men bend like aspens in the wind. </p>",

(Our worst round was one where you had to say which piece of music was used to advertise which car on TV, but I suspect it was everyone's worst round. We can remember the ads - Claudia Schiffer stripping off, all those gorgeous young couples having sex - but no one can ever recall which marques are being promoted.) Every year we spend a weekend with friends in Thorpeness, Suffolk, and we always go to the regular Sunday night family quiz. And every year the town seems to be racked with terrible rumours about people cheating. It was alleged darkly that one family, not knowing the patron saint of doctors, actually sent a child out to the tennis courts to ask a GP who was playing there. Another time the local MP, John Gummer, was accused of having three adults on his table instead of the maximum permitted two. I had reason to take him to lunch soon afterwards and began by saying that there was something important I had to ask him, and that if we cleared it out of the way we could relax and enjoy the lunch. He looked deeply worried, but when I told him of the charge he erupted in a fury. \"I did not cheat!\" he said. \"My poor wife Penny was not taking part in the quiz but she had to go and sit in the bar, on her own, because people kept talking loudly about how we were only allowed two adults, and I'm sick of it!\" But that's quizzes for you; they arouse huge passions and mighty resentments. Last year we took part in a junior school quiz. Next day a woman neighbour, who I know as a pleasant person, asked: \"Aren't you going to congratulate us on our success last night?\" I said I thought she'd only come fourth. \"But we beat you, and that's all that counts!\" she finished. \u0095 It was kind of so many of you to write, but I wish now I hadn't asked for help on the \"he is taller than me/I\" question. Along with quizzes, British people seem obsessed by grammar. I've had innumerable letters and emails, mostly good-humoured but in some cases surprisingly bitter, angry and prescriptive. And long. Heavens, you wouldn't believe how much people can write about two words, one of which is only one letter long. I'd say there was a narrow majority for the accusative case. Quite a lot of you think that \"he is taller than I\" sounds pretentious and clunky, even if it is technically correct. Others dispute even that, claiming that \"than I\", with an implied \"am\" at the end, is a grammarians' invention, dating from the time when they wanted to force the English language into Latin formulations. Another exam ple is the pointless banning of the split infinitive (though the most famous example of that, Star Trek's \"to boldly go\", sounds very peculiar to me. Several point out that our language owes as much to Norman French as to Latin, and the French would always use the strong accusative, \"toi\" and \"moi\". But either way, I shall continue using \"me\" and the correspondence is closed. \u0095 At a whisky reception the other day, I met a man with the splendid title of Professor the Lord Laird of Artigarvan. Even more resonant is his job description, printed on his card in what I thought was Gaelic, yet was instantly understandable: \"Heid-Yin o tha Boord o Ulster Scotch.\" Sadly it turns out to be some weird spoof language which doesn't exist. \u0095 No bore is worse than a football bore, so I'll keep this short. For someone who was raised in Leicester from the age of 13, and who walked to Filbert Street with his brother every fortnight through the season, it is highly gratifying to see Leicester City on top of the Premiership, even if none of the present team was born when I was a regular. Yes, I know it won't last - they play Manchester United in a week's time - and I know that they're thought dogged but dull. But please allow us our brief moment of glory. Lacking big money, Leicester have always had to rely on finding their own talent, including Gordon Banks, Gary Lineker and Emile Heskey. There was a fascinating table published this week showing which Premiership teams use the most foreigners. Chelsea were, of course, top with an average of 8.88 foreigners starting in each game. (Arsenal were second with 7.0). Leicester are comfortably bottom, using an average of only 0.88 foreigners at the beginning of each game. Perhaps if other clubs did a bit more nurturing at home, we might be facing today's game with Germany with a little more confidence. \u0095 The wine writer Tim Atkin was baffled the other day on a trip to Chablis. A Finnish writer on the trip remarked \"your cow is in the ditch\" and all the other Finns at the table fell about laughing. Apparently it means that you are caught between two stools. Tim reminds me of his favourite from the great New Statesman competition for meaningless saws: \"No leg is too short to reach the ground.\" I liked \"seek not the apple blossom upon the cherry tree\". Other examples, real or invented, are welcome. \u0095 At the British Council reception I chatted to Ffion Hague, who's on their board. I can see why the Tories wish she would do more public appearances. She is poised, witty, beautiful, has a lovely speaking voice, and possesses that remarkable gift some women have: she can make any man within 50 yards feel, for a few moments, that he is the most fascinating person in the world. Princess Di had the same knack, which is why weary old goats like me were so completely won over. I was in a group with my old friend John Cassidy, who comes from Leeds but now works for the New Yorker and is over here researching an article about William Hague. \"So we have an interest in common,\" he said to her, by way of small talk. \"Well, at least you don't have a haircut in common,\" Ffion said. \"So that's seen him off,\" I said, pointing to John, who has a perfectly normal bogbrush haircut. \"Oh, no,\" she said, genuinely worried that she'd caused offence. \"I was complimenting his haircut.\" Spelling it out in unnecessary detail, I said, \"so by implication...\" \"Yes!\" she said. No wonder men bend like aspens in the wind.",

My own poor old trade is now ineradicably polluted by people whose only function is to blather about themselves, and now the same infection is sweeping over politics too.

There was that point in Tony Blair's speech at Brighton where he suddenly abandoned his text and spoke spontaneously (we were supposed to think) from the heart. A lot of people in the hall seemed to find this profoundly moving. Watching it on TV, I found it creepy. Even his diction changed: all at once he was in his chat show mode, saying ah instead of I, and glottal-stopping away like a totter from Tooting. If this is the real Blair, I thought, who was that well-spoken chap we've been listening to for the previous 40 minutes? </p> <p>Then at Bournemouth this week we had that tear-stained sequence when Michael Portillo, abandoning his text altogether and speaking (we were supposed to think) spontaneously from the heart, came out as - well, all sorts of things. A Spaniard, for instance. And a hospital porter. </p> <p> This also explains a phenomenon which has baffled Smallweed all year. Why do people warm to Charles Kennedy when he says so little of substance? His leader's speech at the Lib Dem conference last month was as vacuous a concoction as Smallweed has heard in 40 years of conference-going. Yet he is the one whose ratings are rising.

Suddenly half way through he will have abandoned his text, left the rostrum, stood at the end of the stage and begun to confess the terrible grief he felt at the age of four when his teddy bear was snaffled in a Rotherham park by a labrador. With the hall now awash with tears, the mood will then have changed with the appearance of those stroppy sisters of his, as seen on TV last weekend, and a song-and-dance routine of 60s hits will have ensued. </p> <p>Finally, amidst vast ululations, Ffion will have dropped from the rafters on to the stage like Peter Pan in the pantomime, and she and William will then have gone into a snoggy clinch far out-Goreing the Gores. In the end, the party chairman, a Mr Ancram, will only have prised them apart by throwing large amounts of cold water over them. </p> <p> Exactly the same is happening in the US. I saw a focus group session after the Gore-Bush encounter in which a woman who looked like an adult said she was swinging to Bush because though Gore had a much better command of the issues. Bush seemed the sweeter guy. A woman who put it the other way round - Bush seemed the nicer guy, but Gore was more in command of the issues and therefore more voteworthy - came across as a frosty old puritan. </p> <p>Is this is the way the leadership of the world's most powerful nation stands to be decided? Has there ever (final rhetorical question) been a sillier age than ours? </p> <p> Incidentally, Smallweed was astonished to hear a BBC reporter predicted that Tory chairman Ancram would give a barnstorming speech. I know that as party chairman he has to pretend, like poor old Chris Patten before him, to be what he clearly is not, but barnstorming is not a world I would ever have attached to him. </p> <p>Were I a barn, I would feel quite unworried if I saw Ancram approaching armed to the teeth.

Barn dance music, presumably. </p> <p> Enough of that. The season is changing. For reasons beyond my control, the winds are rocking the trees, and the skies are still dark when I wake in the morning. The stores, meanwhile, are full of Christmassery, and soon one will have to avoid them altogether because the air will be fill of saccharine songs about Santa and sleigh bells. For Christmas this year I intend to give almost everyone one of the most entertaining books in the world: A Lexicon of Musical Invective, by Nicolas Slonimsky, a compilation of insults hurled, mostly by critics, at notable music. </p> <p>But who - I hear Arthur Tartt, of Northowram, Halifax asking - is Slonimsky? Sadly he recently died, having first passed 100, but he used to be a musicologist, composer, conductor and pianist who performed some of the works most complained about. \"For two hours,\" wrote a critic when he conducted Var\u00e8se in Berlin in 1932, \"Slonimsky bore down on the Philharmonic musicians until they finally made no secret of their ugly disposition.\" </p> <p>After his performance of the same composer's Ionaization at the Hollywood Bowl the following year, he received a postcard imploring him to perform the writer's own composition scored for two stoves and a kitchen sink.

The opera composer Vincenzo Bellini (who wrote Norma and La Sonnambula) died in Paris, where he had fled to avoid a scandal, in 1835, a few weeks short of his 34th birthday. The cause of death was given as dysentery and gastro-enteritis.

The premiere was not a success; the choir could not cope with Elgar's choral writing, the tenor appeared to believe that he was singing Victorian drawing-room ballads and the bass was a semitone flat throughout his solo in the second part. Only the mezzo-soprano soloist acquitted herself well. Elgar was devastated, and the score was only gradually recognised for the extraordinary achievement that it is. </p> <p>In Birmingham, the centenary was marked on the day itself, not in the town hall but in Symphony Hall just a couple of hundred yards away, when Gerontius was conducted by Sakari Oramo with the City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus and Orchestra, and an international trio of soloists in a performance that was certainly worthy of the occasion. </p> <p>The choir had learnt the work by heart and delivered it from the heart, producing singing of huge intensity and dramatic involvement and, although the tenor, American Vinson Cole, was by no means ideal (making some of his phrase too expressively Italianate, and coming up with some very strange vowel sounds), the other two soloists were superb. John Tomlinson was a terrifying Priest and Angel of the Agony, sounding for all the world as if Hagen had survived from Gotterdammerung to take up another role in the afterlife, while Anne Sofie von Otter was simply the best Angel, ravishingly beautiful, that I have heard since Janet Baker, and there can be no higher praise than that. </p> <p>It's an often repeated observation that if Elgar had been born a German he would have written operas, while if his contemporary Richard Strauss had been an Englishman he would have produced oratorios. Both composers were conditioned by the musical culture in which they grew up. Yet that doesn't make Elgar a peculiarly English composer (or Strauss a particularly Austro-German one for that matter); great composers transcend that kind of labelling anyway. As Gerontius and the major works that came after it - the symphonies and the concertos - demonstrate, he was arguably the least English in his musical outlook of all early 20th-century British composers, with his musical roots in Brahms, Schumann and Wagner; if there is any specific model for Gerontius it is Parsifal, not any of the pallid Victorian oratorios that epitomised the English choral tradition in 1900. </p> <p>But then Elgar's supposed quintessential Englishness has always been a fiction, the artifact of a musical society that had to find ways of dealing with his genius on terms they could understand; hence the appropriation of Nimrod from the Enigma Variations as some kind of distillation of imperial nobility. And that image of the young Elgar galloping across the Malvern Hills to the accompaniment of the Introduction and Allegro for strings in Ken Russell's famous film is another example of the same make-believe; if you want to regard an English composer as a poet of landscape look at George Butterworth or Vaughan Williams, but not at Elgar. </p> <p> Gerontius proclaims Elgar as an outsider in the musical establishment; he was a Roman Catholic by upbringing and this is after all a profoundly Roman Catholic work, setting words by the most controversial of 19th- century English theologians Cardinal Newman, yet given its first performance in a city that was the centre of non-conformism in Victorian Britain. To suggest, as Norman Lebrecht did on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that The Dream of Gerontius is an \"insincere\" piece is absurd; even had Elgar not been contemplating a work on Newman's poem for a decade before the Birmingham commission sparked him into creative action, what possible mileage would there have been in career terms in arousing hostility in his choice of subject matter? He wrote Gerontius because he had to. It remains his greatest choral work and one of his masterpieces, a work by a composer who ranks alongside the finest.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I recently sat down with a high-minded cinephile friend for a Saturday night\u2019s entertainment - a video of a seven-hour Hungarian art film. \u201cNot bad,\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cBut I thought it slightly went off around the five-hour mark, when the dialogue came in.\u201d</p> <p>The film in question was Satantango, made in 1994 by the Hungarian director Bela Tarr, and something of a legend among aficionados of painstakingly slow European art cinema. A film that long and that sombre is not likely to become an international art-house hit along the lines of Jean de Florette, or even to find a comfortable slot on the festival circuit. But Tarr\u2019s film has a reputation as something more than a lugubrious oddity of monstrous proportions - it is a powerful, visionary piece of cinema that creates its own stark world and keeps the viewer compellingly locked in for its duration. In a recent international critics\u2019 poll, Satantango was voted one of the 30 major films of the 90s. Yet in Britain its director remains largely unknown.</p> <p>Not for much longer, perhaps. An earlier, and considerably shorter, Bela Tarr film, Damnation (1987), is due for release here next year, while his most recent film Werckmeister Harmonies recently caused a stir at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where viewers received it as a genuine cinematic UFO. Filmed in Tarr\u2019s characteristic slow, analytically prowling shots, Werckmeister Harmonies is set in a desolate rural settlement where a violent communal madness is sparked by the arrival of a bizarre fairground attraction - the preserved body of a huge whale. The film culminates in a frightening sequence in which a mob marches on, then silently demolishes, the local hospital. The film\u2019s atmosphere has something in common with David Lynch, but the real affinities are with Kafka, Dostoevsky and Beckett.</p> <p>Tarr and his regular collaborators - his editor (and wife) Agnes Hranitsky and co-writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai - paint society as a simmering nightmare that can explode at any time into brutal dementia. Coming from an eastern European film-maker, the political overtones are evident, if never underlined.</p> <p>In any period of cinema history, a director like Tarr would be an out right exception, but today his work represents a prodigy of dissidence. Tarr is one of the film-makers named by Susan Sontag - in an article published in the Guardian in 1996 - as offering some hope for the continuation of cinema. Sontag was lamenting the death of cinephilia, the attitude that treats cinema as an exceptional art form, \u201cquintessentially modern; distinctively accessible; poetic and mysterious and erotic and moral - all at the same time.\u201d In the 90s, Sontag argued, cinema had gone into \u201cignominious, irreversible decline\u201d, and great films would no longer be merely exceptions, but \u201cheroic violations\u201d of the norm.</p> <p>This may not hold true in all parts of the world - film language seems constantly to reinvent itself in Iran, and in the work of Asian directors such as Taiwan\u2019s Tsai-Ming Liang and Korea\u2019s Hong Sang-Soo. But Tarr is one of a very few European directors determined to work outside mainstream forms, and who still believe in cinema\u2019s potential to transform the viewer. These film-makers are not out to convey obvious messages, and in these pragmatic days, they risk coming across like mystics. But the keynote of their work is not woolly transcendentalism, but intrepid and rigorous formal invention.</p> <p>The antecedents of such cinema are the likes of Andrei Tarkovsky, the almost forgotten Hungarian master Miklos Jansco, the German Expressionist cinema of the 20s, or the work of 70s German directors, especially Werner Herzog. This school of cinema refuses to spoon-feed us with ready-made experiences or easily recognisable beauty: the beauty in these films is easily mistaken for the ugly or drab. That would certainly account for the impatient, almost offended drubbing that British critics last week gave to Abendland, by the young German director Fred Kelemen - another of Sontag\u2019s favoured few, and a former student of Tarr\u2019s. \u201cBela and I share the same vision of cinema,\u201d Kelemen says. \u201cWe believe in time and not in speed - atmospheres and situations rather than stories.\u201d Needless to say, Abendland has already disappeared from London screens after just a week.</p> <p>Kelemen\u2019s films are severe to a fault - although he does have a penchant for trashy Euro-disco on his soundtracks. Abendland tracks the nocturnal movements through an unidentified and vaguely medieval European city of a pair of impoverished, weary lovers. The hellish events they face are sometimes realistic, sometimes have the heightened feel of nightmare, but are rooted in real-world politics - Kelemen\u2019s work is set among Europe\u2019s underclass of homeless and unemployed, and especially Germany\u2019s abused foreign workers. His imaginative landscape is all frontiers and journeys, informed by changing European geography; Frost, his sec ond film, has a mother and child trekking across Germany to the Polish border. But there is an existential angle to the theme. \u201cWe are on a journey, very simply. We\u2019re born, we die and in between we have to make our way, and there\u2019s no way to stop. Even if you sit in your room and do nothing, time is passing and something is happening - which is a very big adventure.\u201d</p> <p>Kelemen and Tarr may inhabit the absolute margins of European cinema but they are by no means alone. The science of long takes and landscape tableaux - as if the screen were a huge map to be unfolded - still flourishes in the work of Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, who has been refining his art of geographically spectacular slowness since the 70s. In Russia, Aleksandr Sokurov\u2019s pictorial finesse unequivocally follows Tarkovsky\u2019s mystical tradition: his muted, enigmatic miniature Mother and Son was a cult art-house success (although for my money, his follow-up Moloch, a chilly, anaesthetised political cartoon about Hitler\u2019s home life, is far more interesting). Other pensive outsiders who fit the mould are the truly marginal Portuguese. For example, there is Pedro Costa, whose Lisbon junkie drama Ossos is one of the great overlooked films of the 90s. And surely the most waywardly unpredictable European auteur, bar none, is Joao Cesar Monteiro, who appears as his own rou\u00e9-philosopher anti-hero in such demented, leisurely rambles as God\u2019s Comedy and The Hips of JW (about a mission to find John Wayne at the North Pole). </p> <p>It goes without saying that this cinema is very much prey to the vagaries of personal taste. It is possible to believe passionately in the virtues of slowness, alienation, the creation of a dream-like, hermetic reality - and still not be able to swallow the self-importance of a film like Bruno Dumont\u2019s L\u2019Humanit\u00e9, which would seem to fulfil all those criteria. Kelemen admits that in the kind of cinema he practices, \u201cit\u2019s always a question of openness, of state of mind, whether one enters into it or not - it can even depend on the day you see it.\u201d That is why many of these films are like messages in bottles, thrown into the ocean in the hope that the right viewer will see them in the right frame of mind. You could call it Castaway Cinema, and one of its most heroically strange castaways is globetrotting Lithuanian director Sharunas Bartas. Bartas\u2019s films include Few of Us, about a young woman\u2019s unexplained mission to Mongolia, and the baroque The House, in which a crowd of outcasts stage enigmatic indoor tableaux.</p> <p>These poetic and exceptionally mysterious pieces are closer to art video than narrative cinema. His latest film Freedom, featured in the forthcoming London Film Festival, is again a wordless affair, of figures in a North African landscape and events replaced by images - crabs falling out of a bag, sand blowing across arid plains. One of the few British screenings of Bartas\u2019 work was provided by Turner Prize winner Steve McQueen, who pro grammed it in a recent season at the ICA. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like having a conversation with someone,\u201d McQueen says. \u201cIt\u2019s in real time, it takes a long time to finish a sentence, but you go through the whole process, and there\u2019s this result, the pay-off, and you think - yes!\u201d</p> <p>The work of these rare, rejected but vital castaway directors can\u2019t easily be defined in terms of where it comes from, how it is made, or even how slow it is. That would account for the challenge, and the unusual rewards, of this very subjective cinema, a cinema that practically psychoanalyses you - and if you\u2019re lucky, cures you of your Hollywood-induced traumas.</p> <p>\u2022 Freedom plays in the London Film Festival on Nov 11. Damnation is released here next year.</p>",

The last gal I heard saying it was the then 15-year-old Billie Piper, in that incredibly bratty chart-topper of the same name. Well, it only took a couple of years to knock that sort of sass out of her, and now poor Billie spends most of her waking hours denying that she takes drugs, drinks to excess and chucks celebrity boyfriends in order to get publicity for her records.

On the contrary, I believe that denying our desires and excusing them as needs causes a lot more trouble than being straightforward about our selfishness would. A society that recognised that people generally do as they want would stand very little nonsense from the two men per week who kill their wives, partners and exes, usually pleading diminished responsibility and claiming they were \"driven\" to it by \"nagging\" or \"taunting\" witches; the same goes for child molesters who \"couldn't help themselves\". Of course, we've got to be understanding and sensitive and all that guff but, if someone really wanted to use that old line about not knowing what came over them in order to wangle a lighter sentence, I'd sure as hell make sure they had their voting rights automatically removed, too; we don't let mad people vote, after all. And if you deny that you have free will and are so weak that you can, in fact, have your actions dictated to you by the liquid distilled from a rotting potato (vodka), as alcoholics do, are you really any more deserving of your stake in democracy than a man who thinks he's Napoleon? </p> <p>I'd have a lot more respect for even nasty people if they just admitted why they do what they do - because they want to. If only a bloke from the Countryside Alliance would stand up just once on Newsnight and say, \"Well, Jeremy, the thing is I get the most enormous stiffy when I see that damned attractive little fox bitch being torn apart, and what's wrong with that, what?\" But, instead, they wheel out a load of cant about the fox enjoying it (just like rapists!) and it being necessary for the countryside, otherwise all the trees would fall down. People who work in animal labs are another lot: they're sadists, and there's no two ways about it. Why not come out and admit it? They'd probably find that, in the long run, people would be far more understanding and tolerant of their sadism than they are of all those transparent lies about a new mango-and-apple shampoo being absolutely vital for the future survival of mankind and therefore worth the sight of a couple of hundred beagles. Hell, if they came out and said that they were addicted to hurting animals, they'd probably get on Richard And Judy, sharing sniffles and big feely hugs with Denise The Agony Aunt. </p> <p> Very few things are truly addictive: heroin, for instance, bends over backwards to let potential addicts off the hook, making most people extremely ill the first few times they take it. It is probably harder to become addicted to heroin than to kick it.

She admits to plastic surgery, even to breast surgery - \"My nipples kind of pointed downward, so I had them moved from here to there,\" she once said in an interview about the after-effects of giving birth to her son, Daniel, in her teens - but \"I haven't had silicone implants, no.\" This is a pity, because she has often been written about confidently as if she had; and, assuming this to be so, I concluded that her triumph last week in a Los Angeles court, where she was awarded $449 million from the estate of her late 90-year-old husband, J Howard Marshall II, was not only a personal triumph but one for the breast transplant industry as a whole. </p> <p>There were strong reasons for thinking this, because she not only met her future husband in Houston, Texas, the city that pioneered the breast transplant, but she did so as a stripper in Rick's Cabaret, the most famous topless bar in Houston. Everything I know about Rick's comes from an enormously long article, which I read five years ago in the Texas Monthly, entitled \"Silicone City: The rise and fall of the implant - or how Houston went from an oil-based economy to a breast-based economy\". </p> <p>\"No two products were more interdependent than Rick's and the implant,\" the article said. Its owner, Robert Watters, a Canadian lawyer with a degree from the London School of Economics, told the magazine, \"In the early and mid-80s, the first material acquisition the dancers saved for was breast augmentation.\" But it seems that Smith was lucky and didn't need it. </p> <p>A brief history of silicone implants ... Silicone was first used after the second world war, when Japanese women, normally smaller-breasted than American women, had it injected into their breasts to please American servicemen. Then, in 1962, a woman called Timmie Jean Lindsay became the first woman in the world to receive a silicone-gel implant: married at 15 and divorced at 30, after bringing six children into the world, she was in hospital in Houston to have tattoos removed from her breasts when the surgeon asked if she would like to have them made more shapely at the same time. Her answer was yes, and with that there was born a multibillion-dollar industry. Throughout the US, breast augmentation rapidly became a female obsession. One Houston celebrity doctor had already performed between 2,500 to 3,000 implants by 1995. He and his colleagues found their incomes rising from the low six figures up to $2 million a year. And even after 1990, when panic erupted about the side-effects of what had been promoted as a cheap, safe operation, there were millions more to be earned, not only by lawyers but by doctors for taking out the bags of silicone they had put in. </p> <p>Research by America's most illustrious medical institutions failed to prove that there was any more illness among women who had had breast implants than among those who hadn't, but the huge awards given by juries to plaintiffs were sufficient to bankrupt the country's principal implant manufacturer - and to burst the implant bubble, as it were. Nevertheless, the implant craze had amazing staying power. It survived the fashion for skinny models, and would probably be going as strong now, if it were not for anxiety about the health side-effects. </p> <p>Trying to explain the phenomenon, the Houston inventors of the silicone-gel implant, Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, wrote in the early 60s that it was perhaps \"due in large measure to the tremendous amount of publicity which has been given to some movie actresses blessed with generous sized breasts. Many women with limited development of the breasts are extremely sensitive about it\". Women who have undergone the operation usually say they wanted to increase their \"self-esteem\". But it seems to be all the fault of men, really - of men such as J Howard Marshall II, the master of an immense oil fortune, who, although 89 years old and confined to a wheelchair, went regularly to Rick's at lunchtime to drool over the generously proportioned body of Anna Nicole Smith. </p> <p>Anna, the small-town girl from Mexia, Texas, who dreamt from childhood of being Marilyn Monroe, believes she understands this: \"Most men, I think, like a womanly figure.\" The feminist campaign against the treatment of women as sex objects seems to have completely passed her by, and she is $449 million richer as a result. \"Are you a feminist?\" she was once asked. \"I don't understand the question,\" she replied. \"Do you fight for women's rights?\" \"Whoever started that, I could kick them in the head.\" But Anna is a religious person. \"What's heaven like?\" she was asked. \"I think heaven's a beautiful place. Gold. You walk on gold floors.\" It looks as if she might be there already.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I don't know how long he'd been standing there. Some actors can do that, make themselves into a hole in the air just by turning themselves off. Most of them do the opposite, come on full-pelt with all their well-rehearsed little sensibilities and idiosyncrasies, so that you think it must be your birthday until you discover that every journalist in the western world has been privy to an identical performance. It seems to be a question of who they're in the habit of being, professionally; themselves or someone else. Given that these days the big movie-selling proposition, the trick that inflates box-office takings, is personality recognition, you don't often find yourself in a room with a star coming on like a hologram. </p> <p>Guy Pearce (I told him, babbling somewhat) reminds me of an actor I used to know who had this amazing knack of becoming invisible when he didn't want to be looked at. It was as though he could do something to his skin, at will, that made your eyes slide off him. \"Was he a good actor?\" asked the man-shaped thing, beginning to substantiate. \"Absolutely,\" I said, \"on stage you couldn't take your eyes off him.\" A faint expression of something like gratification flushed a lean jowl. \"Yeah,\" he said, as in, \"Thank God for that\", and permitted further out-fleshing: handsome, yes, blue-eyed, blue-jeaned, hair like the rats have gnawed it, huge muddy hiking boots and silver rings on at least two fingers. </p> <p>He offers a yard-wide grin and the small intimacy of the sure and certain fact that if I hadn't asked the publicity crew to vacate, he would have done. It was bad enough for him to meet a stranger without having the ghost of a character to wrap himself up in, without getting a bloody audience into the bargain. Circumstances such as these, he says, bring on the big anxiety rush, make his heart pound. He thumps himself somewhere below his left shoulder by way of illustration. And the voice in his head, always the same, goes \"keep it together keep it together keep it together keep it together\", and he's buggered if he knows why, except that he can't tolerate people forming an opinion of him, being the victim of their conclusions while they think he's weird or boring or miserable or whatever. </p> <p>Years ago, he had to go to a conference for young Australian actors hoping to make the big move to Hollywood and some know-all was instructing them they'd have to employ a publicist because publicists publicise your personality. He was puzzling that one out when Sam Neill piped up how he could do without one of those on account of the fact that he doesn't have a personality to publicise. Which is how he feels to this day. He means, Jeez, what's he supposed to do? Roar about going, Way-hey, hup-zing, look at my personality? \"Nah.\" He doesn't have that kind of confidence, which is another thing to be anxious about. </p> <p>Take yesterday. He'd been supposed to spend the morning with photographers and publicists in charge of making the posters for The Count Of Monte Cristo. Fair enough. He turned up on time, got into period costume and did what he was told, then they wanted him to take his cossie off and \"be himself\". Why? What has himself to do with the film? </p> <p>They told him they reckoned that The Count Of Monte Cristo meant zilch to \"the young\", whereas they'd recognise Guy Pearce because he'd been in Neighbours. So he got out of his cossie and sloped off home, like, you know, fuck that . He worries about these things. A mate tried to calm him once, saying, look, it's showbusiness, pronouncing it \"pissiness\", then making it sound even more obscene, \"Show Business \", as in, where's the art in that? It makes you anxious. Particularly when you're a miserable, sarky sod like himself, always seeing the negative side. </p> <p>He's a synapse, he says suddenly, and, no, he doesn't know how you bloody spell it, he just knows what it is. A bunch of raw nerves. He feels like one of those sea anemones, waving their tendrils about until something swims by and they immediately close up like a fist. Unless it is a clown fish. They don't seem to mind clown fish. So that's him, really. Barring the odd encounter with a clown fish, he's just this bundle of nerves who keeps himself to himself until he gets up to do his shtick, which is the whole attraction of being an actor in the first place. </p> <p>Except he does worry a lot that he's not really an actor, that he's just acting being an actor and that deep down he's a fraud, deluding himself. You can't help thinking like that when you've just made a film such as Memento, which this particular publicity-fest is supposed to be in aid of. Responses so far have been \"interesting\", in the sense that people he'd have marked up as intellectual and educated don't seem to understand what the hell it was about, while other, less ostentatiously brainy types get it in one. So what did I think? </p> <p>Art house is what I thought. Noir as Newgate's knocker. Low budget. I thought it was a metaphor for the human condition, and the human condition is so disgusting I don't want to look at it. I thought we are all, all of us, a load of self-serving, self-pitying, manipulative, murderous, greedy, spiteful, vengeful, frighened, confused, pointless shits who keep reminding ourselves to keep up the good work of being a load of self-serving, self-pitying, etcetera and so forth, and I loved the film. \"Yeah,\" he said, \"that's why I loved making it.\" </p> <p>He's not supposed to say what it cost to make. He's not supposed to say that they made the whole film in 25 days flat or that it didn't cost more than $4 million or $5 million. Bad for business, you understand. In the US, they've worked it all out, like, hey, man, it's going to be a $60 million movie, then we get Tom Cruise, which makes it an $80 million movie, then we employ 70 or 80 blokes to stand around on the set scratching themselves and wondering what they can throw more money at. Then they work out the stats of the first week's box-office takings and publish them, so the punters can be assured that the film is already into profit even though the serious reviews say that it's crap. And it works. People go to see the movie and come away saying, well, yes, it was absolute rubbish, but it had lots of huge explosions and it cost $150 million. It has all been something of a culture shock for a simple Aussie actor who is used to making films where actual pride is taken on not pissing money up the wall. So, no, he's not moving to Los Angeles. So far as he's concerned, a job's a job and he's lucky to get one anywhere, but when it's over he lets America trundle on in the way it trundles on and Mr Pearce gets on a plane and goes home to Oz. </p> <p>He used to think he was just a cynical bastard, but now he's not so sure. Maybe he's just another pragmatic Aussie who can't help seeing things the way they are, which is not very nice. He would, for instance, say that he had a wonderful childhood, blessed with a wonderful mother and a wonderful sister and wonderful friends, and that would be nothing but the truth. </p> <p>Only then he made Memento and believed in it and began to wonder about himself. About his own memories. The explicit theme of the film is about a man who loses his short-term memory and has to remind himself, by writing notes to himself and tattooing his emotional status quo all over his body, that he has a score to settle. In other words, he is both a victim and a predator, and has no means of knowing which unlovely side of his character is uppermost at any given moment. Once you start thinking about the implications of that little lot, you have to question the entire contents of your brain. You can't be too careful. </p> <p>Only so much is assured. Guy was born in England, somewhere south of Cambridge, with a New Zealander father and a British mother - he was a test pilot employed by the Royal Air Force, she a schoolteacher specialising in needlework and home economics. His sister's name is Tracy. The family moved to Bristol and then, when he was three, to Australia. </p> <p>So far, so good. He can't be expected to remember England, even though he's always known he can drop into an English accent whenever he needs to. Come to that, he can drop into just about any accent he fancies, just when he feels like it. Anyway, he grew up in Geelong, which is an hour's drive south of Melbourne in the state of Victoria, where, unlike the rest of Australia, it gets very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Geelong was great. It still is. He went to school and had lots of mates and once, by way of a hobby, his mum ran a deer farm there. It wasn't a thriving business, exactly, they just had the deer wandering about, and once a year they'd strip their antlers and sell them to somebody who made a Chinese remedy out of them. He doesn't know what it was a remedy for. </p> <p> He's not entirely sure he remembers this, but he knows, like he knows what a synapse is, that it happened on August 6, 1976, and it was a Friday. It had been Tim's mum's turn to pick them up from school, and the two boys sat in the back of the car on the way home, arranging to meet later. Tim's mum said, no, she didn't think so, which was odd, so they mouthed their own silent intent at each other and Guy went in for his tea. He could tell at once that something special was up, because they seemed to have been visited by all their Kiwi relatives at once and his mum took him up to his room and sat on the end of his bed. He remembers her telling him that his dad had been killed at work and then he remembers seeing her standing in a doorframe bawling her eyes out. He does not remember thinking or feeling anything much more than a small frisson of surprise that his mother was out of control for the first - and, as it happens, the last - time in his life. </p> <p>Guy and his sister didn't go to their father's funeral. Mum went, they stayed at home. And afterwards life went on in the same way as before, except that dad wasn't around any more. He's not sure he has any true, independent memory of his father at all. Of course, he idolised him. He knew, because everybody told him so, that his father was as heroic as it gets. That he was profoundly decent and witty and wonderful. A man without a flaw. </p> <p>There were photographs of his father in the house, and adults who had known him would point out how, looked at in profile, Guy was beginning to resemble him. But mostly there were pictures of him in cockpits and wide-angle shots of jet aircraft so that, being only seven years old, Guy thought that perhaps a Lockhead Lightning was his dad. He had a lot to live up to. He never thought as a child that he was different from other kids because he didn't have a father. It was more that his family as a unit was more controlled, more circumspect, than other families. It felt to him as though they had some great secret to protect. He'd see other families screaming and shouting at each other, letting it all hang out, and he'd think, we're not like that. </p> <p>He supposes that he began to be a bit of a loner at that point. He perceived himself as a well-behaved, responsible boy. His mother told him so, and he believed her. Sometimes, when he was by himself having a bit of a think or trying to work out how something worked, his mum would say to him, \"Get that miserable look off your face\", and he'd immediately go into idiot-happy-boy mode: Oh, right, I'm not miserable, I'm fine, ha-ha-ha. Which he's rather afraid he still does. In fact, he's getting sick of himself expending all his energy cracking on that he's feeling what he imagines other people want him to feel. </p> <p>Ah, but he's not blaming his mum. She coped as best she could. He ran away from school when he was nine. A whole gang of them took off into the wide blue yonder until the cops caught them and sent for their mothers. He remembers watching the other mums claiming their lads. \"Are you all right?\" \"Thank God you're safe!\" All that sort of thing. And then his mum came and said to him grimly, \"If your dad was alive, he'd send you to the technical school for this.\" Which was tantamount to threatening him with reform school. </p> <p>He used to envy other boys their insouciance, their natural ability to tell their mothers to fuck off. He could never do that, because she was always there saying, \"You are such a responsible boy\", while he turned himself inside out to justify her faith in him. Sometimes, he thinks he's spent his entire life waiting for someone to come along and tell him who he is, because he's buggered if he knows. He even wonders if being good at finding a character to be and then being it means he's not even a real actor. Just a kid with a deep, dark, hidden quality that he seems to draw on but doesn't necessarily understand. </p> <p>It was his mum who first took him to the theatre. They'd go to the Geelong Society of Operatic and Dramatic Art, called Gesoda for short, and he knew right away that he wanted to have the affect on people that the actors on the stage were having on him. This had nothing to do with a hidden extrovert quality lurking beneath his guarded exterior. Far from it. He knew from an early age that he could impersonate linguistically. He loved the music of different accents, the whole different language of them and the energy behind them. But he was never the class clown. If he took someone off, he'd make it short; wait for the gasp and the recognition and then stop. He was more likely to use a funny voice to deflect attention from himself than to court the amusement of his peers. </p> <p>He lived in dread of Tuesday mornings when some luckless schoolboy would be obliged to stand up in front of assembly and read aloud the news and sports reports. The idea of presenting himself as himself gave him crippling stage fright. Yet being in a play didn't count. He remembers, or thinks he remembers, the occasion of his first stage role. He must have been nine years old when the school put on a musical version of something called Smith, culled from an English television series. They gave him the title role, and he made a job of this Oliver Twist sort of kid who talked wiv a cockney accent an kep gettin inter trouble. </p> <p>When the first show was over, the cast stood in a line across the stage and the audience applauded and then he had to step forward on his own while everyone clapped and cheered. He remembers he got a buzz, but it wasn't the buzz that mattered; it was what came into his head. The words, \"It works.\" He says he's not very articulate and, of course, he might have made it up after the event and it might not be a true memory at all. But he can still hear it; that clear, triumphal, almost grim little voice. \"It works.\" </p> <p>So he joined Gesoda-for-short, and effectively began his career at the age of 11. Acting and singing were what he did with his time. He had some idea of being a rock singer, but then so did most boys. He is, he says, very narrow-minded. To illustrate his point, he does something with his hands, something meticulous, as though he's mending a particularly delicate wristwatch. He concentrates on what he's doing for as long as it takes and that's all there is to it. He has no sense of ambition, never thought that one day he'd go to Hollywood and be a Hollywood star. It just happened. Local theatre, audition for TV show, TV show, film script, film, play, film script, film, film script, film, Hollywood. That's the chronology, but it was never a career, a progression with a beginning, a middle and an end, a linear journey towards the big bucks. </p> <p>So far as he is concerned, each part he plays is separate from the one before, of the same intrinsic value, but different. What gives him a thrill is the idea that, if he goes on working for the next 60 years, someone would look back at what he's done and say, wow, what a diverse range of stuff. </p> <p>He'd like to be an actor of the Gary Oldman quality. He believes him, always, whatever he does. As opposed to, say, Tom Cruise or George Clooney, who are, well, Tom Cruise and George Clooney. He means, good on 'em and all that, they've got a niche and they're probably great guys when you meet them, but he's not interested. If you know what he means. </p> <p>The price of fame, apparently, is not all that exorbitant for the kind of actor he has become. He finds it particularly gratifying at this juncture to realise that he can wander freely through the streets of Dublin without being besieged by teenaged girls waving autograph books and grabbing his bits. He was a little nervous when he arrived because Neighbours is huge in Ireland, so they tell him. But everyone seems to have grown up now, or forgotten who he used to be. Which is nothing if not respectful of them. He did four years on Ramsay Street playing Mike, the damaged lad, bad childhood, bashed and abandoned by his parents, adopted into Jason and Kylie's world. Daggy. Very daggy. And everywhere he went between the ages of 18 and 22 there were girls screaming, \"Guy Pearce, Guy Pearce\", and following him about. Not that it turned his head. Why would it, when they'd do exactly the same to Bouncer the dog? Something similar happens now, if he's not careful. </p> <p>Going home to Australia from Hollywood, suddenly he's the big star who's kicked American butt and that makes it hard to go back to the theatre to resume what he's good at. He tried it last year, and the bloody fools oversold him and unbalanced the relationship between himself and the other actors. And again, his hands explore the complicated mechanism of the imaginary timepiece. </p> <p>He seems to find something slightly absurd about his chosen profession, something a touch pathetic about being a man who \"shape-shifts\" for a living. At the same time, he hopes that, if he does enough of it and people recognise the value of his talent to metamorphose, he'll calm down as a man and find the confidence to be himself, or, as he puts it, \"be a boring git when I feel like it\". When I tell him that, in my inexpert opinion, his film roles to date might be categorised as giving good mean-streak, he takes it as a rose to pin in his buttonhole. </p> <p>He is not villain material, he merely has a rare and subtle ability to flash the dark, hidden side of a personality without either tearing the arse out of it or persuading you to dislike him. His pious young cop in LA Confidential, Hollywood-drawn rather corny Clark Kentish figure, on the side of law and order, brave as a lion when it comes to the crunch, might have been predictably dull, except that somehow, fleetingly, he managed to convey that he actually enjoys shopping his erring colleagues. The drag queen in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert might have been a spiteful tart who takes pleasure in calling a transsexual \"Ralph\", but for the tender, womanly split-second of his feelings towards a child. </p> <p>His prosecuting attorney in Rules Of Engagement might have been another soulless jobsworth, except he also indicates the sad vulnerability of a man trapped in a testosterone-oriented environment. Wherever he's going, as a shape-shifter, he's well on his way. </p> <p>He thinks one day soon he's going to go looking for the reality of his father; talk to his father's sisters and brothers-in-laws in New Zealand to find out what else he was, besides a paragon of heroism. He thinks it will make him feel better about himself. As it is, he feels as though he's 100 years old, the most practical, responsible, adult person in the history of the world, while running alongside an eight-year-old kid who can only imagine a personality and play it out, the whole caboodle held together by an anxiety neurosis without which he'd be so lost he'd trip over himself and fall down a hole. </p> <p>He is also grievously homesick. He can't believe he's saying this, but he's a married man. Three years ago, he met Kate, and they got married. She's the kind of woman, he says, that when you're at a party you know that you can catch her eye across a crowded room and exchange the wonderful, silent intimacy of acknowledging that everyone in the place is a dickhead. </p> <p>They haven't had any children because they have this thing about over-population and, besides, they like animals. Animals, you understand, being emotionally upfront and honest, unlike human beings. They've got four fish, two cats and a dog called Zelda. She's an African hunting dog, a basenji. He is of the enchantingly Darwinian opinion that, once upon a time, cats and dogs were the same animal and then, for some reason of biological interference, they split into two distinct animals. In this regard, Zelda is a cuspal creature, two legs dog, two legs cat. For one thing, she does not bark, barking being a purely man-made function caused by the stresses put upon dogs by their colonists. No, Zelda yodels and yowls. She also washes herself and climbs trees. </p> <p>Jeez, but he misses Zelda. He wants to go home and dig his garden and bum around and smoke huge amounts of pot and think about what he's going to do next. I think maybe we'd better leave out the bit about the pot, in case they won't let him back into America. He thinks about it for a moment. His hands do their watch-mending thing, then he says, upfront and honest, \"I don't give a shit.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "I don't know how long he'd been standing there. Some actors can do that, make themselves into a hole in the air just by turning themselves off. Most of them do the opposite, come on full-pelt with all their well-rehearsed little sensibilities and idiosyncrasies, so that you think it must be your birthday until you discover that every journalist in the western world has been privy to an identical performance. It seems to be a question of who they're in the habit of being, professionally; themselves or someone else. Given that these days the big movie-selling proposition, the trick that inflates box-office takings, is personality recognition, you don't often find yourself in a room with a star coming on like a hologram. Guy Pearce (I told him, babbling somewhat) reminds me of an actor I used to know who had this amazing knack of becoming invisible when he didn't want to be looked at. It was as though he could do something to his skin, at will, that made your eyes slide off him. \"Was he a good actor?\" asked the man-shaped thing, beginning to substantiate. \"Absolutely,\" I said, \"on stage you couldn't take your eyes off him.\" A faint expression of something like gratification flushed a lean jowl. \"Yeah,\" he said, as in, \"Thank God for that\", and permitted further out-fleshing: handsome, yes, blue-eyed, blue-jeaned, hair like the rats have gnawed it, huge muddy hiking boots and silver rings on at least two fingers. He offers a yard-wide grin and the small intimacy of the sure and certain fact that if I hadn't asked the publicity crew to vacate, he would have done. It was bad enough for him to meet a stranger without having the ghost of a character to wrap himself up in, without getting a bloody audience into the bargain. Circumstances such as these, he says, bring on the big anxiety rush, make his heart pound. He thumps himself somewhere below his left shoulder by way of illustration. And the voice in his head, always the same, goes \"keep it together keep it together keep it together keep it together\", and he's buggered if he knows why, except that he can't tolerate people forming an opinion of him, being the victim of their conclusions while they think he's weird or boring or miserable or whatever. Years ago, he had to go to a conference for young Australian actors hoping to make the big move to Hollywood and some know-all was instructing them they'd have to employ a publicist because publicists publicise your personality. He was puzzling that one out when Sam Neill piped up how he could do without one of those on account of the fact that he doesn't have a personality to publicise. Which is how he feels to this day. He means, Jeez, what's he supposed to do? Roar about going, Way-hey, hup-zing, look at my personality? \"Nah.\" He doesn't have that kind of confidence, which is another thing to be anxious about. Take yesterday. He'd been supposed to spend the morning with photographers and publicists in charge of making the posters for The Count Of Monte Cristo. Fair enough. He turned up on time, got into period costume and did what he was told, then they wanted him to take his cossie off and \"be himself\". Why? What has himself to do with the film? They told him they reckoned that The Count Of Monte Cristo meant zilch to \"the young\", whereas they'd recognise Guy Pearce because he'd been in Neighbours. So he got out of his cossie and sloped off home, like, you know, fuck that . He worries about these things. A mate tried to calm him once, saying, look, it's showbusiness, pronouncing it \"pissiness\", then making it sound even more obscene, \"Show Business \", as in, where's the art in that? It makes you anxious. Particularly when you're a miserable, sarky sod like himself, always seeing the negative side. He's a synapse, he says suddenly, and, no, he doesn't know how you bloody spell it, he just knows what it is. A bunch of raw nerves. He feels like one of those sea anemones, waving their tendrils about until something swims by and they immediately close up like a fist. Unless it is a clown fish. They don't seem to mind clown fish. So that's him, really. Barring the odd encounter with a clown fish, he's just this bundle of nerves who keeps himself to himself until he gets up to do his shtick, which is the whole attraction of being an actor in the first place. Except he does worry a lot that he's not really an actor, that he's just acting being an actor and that deep down he's a fraud, deluding himself. You can't help thinking like that when you've just made a film such as Memento, which this particular publicity-fest is supposed to be in aid of. Responses so far have been \"interesting\", in the sense that people he'd have marked up as intellectual and educated don't seem to understand what the hell it was about, while other, less ostentatiously brainy types get it in one. So what did I think? Art house is what I thought. Noir as Newgate's knocker. Low budget.

He concentrates on what he's doing for as long as it takes and that's all there is to it. He has no sense of ambition, never thought that one day he'd go to Hollywood and be a Hollywood star. It just happened. Local theatre, audition for TV show, TV show, film script, film, play, film script, film, film script, film, Hollywood. That's the chronology, but it was never a career, a progression with a beginning, a middle and an end, a linear journey towards the big bucks. So far as he is concerned, each part he plays is separate from the one before, of the same intrinsic value, but different. What gives him a thrill is the idea that, if he goes on working for the next 60 years, someone would look back at what he's done and say, wow, what a diverse range of stuff. He'd like to be an actor of the Gary Oldman quality. He believes him, always, whatever he does. As opposed to, say, Tom Cruise or George Clooney, who are, well, Tom Cruise and George Clooney. He means, good on 'em and all that, they've got a niche and they're probably great guys when you meet them, but he's not interested. If you know what he means. The price of fame, apparently, is not all that exorbitant for the kind of actor he has become. He finds it particularly gratifying at this juncture to realise that he can wander freely through the streets of Dublin without being besieged by teenaged girls waving autograph books and grabbing his bits. He was a little nervous when he arrived because Neighbours is huge in Ireland, so they tell him. But everyone seems to have grown up now, or forgotten who he used to be. Which is nothing if not respectful of them. He did four years on Ramsay Street playing Mike, the damaged lad, bad childhood, bashed and abandoned by his parents, adopted into Jason and Kylie's world. Daggy. Very daggy. And everywhere he went between the ages of 18 and 22 there were girls screaming, \"Guy Pearce, Guy Pearce\", and following him about. Not that it turned his head. Why would it, when they'd do exactly the same to Bouncer the dog? Something similar happens now, if he's not careful. Going home to Australia from Hollywood, suddenly he's the big star who's kicked American butt and that makes it hard to go back to the theatre to resume what he's good at. He tried it last year, and the bloody fools oversold him and unbalanced the relationship between himself and the other actors. And again, his hands explore the complicated mechanism of the imaginary timepiece. He seems to find something slightly absurd about his chosen profession, something a touch pathetic about being a man who \"shape-shifts\" for a living. At the same time, he hopes that, if he does enough of it and people recognise the value of his talent to metamorphose, he'll calm down as a man and find the confidence to be himself, or, as he puts it, \"be a boring git when I feel like it\". When I tell him that, in my inexpert opinion, his film roles to date might be categorised as giving good mean-streak, he takes it as a rose to pin in his buttonhole. He is not villain material, he merely has a rare and subtle ability to flash the dark, hidden side of a personality without either tearing the arse out of it or persuading you to dislike him. His pious young cop in LA Confidential, Hollywood-drawn rather corny Clark Kentish figure, on the side of law and order, brave as a lion when it comes to the crunch, might have been predictably dull, except that somehow, fleetingly, he managed to convey that he actually enjoys shopping his erring colleagues. The drag queen in The Adventures Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert might have been a spiteful tart who takes pleasure in calling a transsexual \"Ralph\", but for the tender, womanly split-second of his feelings towards a child. His prosecuting attorney in Rules Of Engagement might have been another soulless jobsworth, except he also indicates the sad vulnerability of a man trapped in a testosterone-oriented environment. Wherever he's going, as a shape-shifter, he's well on his way. He thinks one day soon he's going to go looking for the reality of his father; talk to his father's sisters and brothers-in-laws in New Zealand to find out what else he was, besides a paragon of heroism. He thinks it will make him feel better about himself. As it is, he feels as though he's 100 years old, the most practical, responsible, adult person in the history of the world, while running alongside an eight-year-old kid who can only imagine a personality and play it out, the whole caboodle held together by an anxiety neurosis without which he'd be so lost he'd trip over himself and fall down a hole. He is also grievously homesick. He can't believe he's saying this, but he's a married man. Three years ago, he met Kate, and they got married. She's the kind of woman, he says, that when you're at a party you know that you can catch her eye across a crowded room and exchange the wonderful, silent intimacy of acknowledging that everyone in the place is a dickhead. They haven't had any children because they have this thing about over-population and, besides, they like animals. Animals, you understand, being emotionally upfront and honest, unlike human beings. They've got four fish, two cats and a dog called Zelda. She's an African hunting dog, a basenji. He is of the enchantingly Darwinian opinion that, once upon a time, cats and dogs were the same animal and then, for some reason of biological interference, they split into two distinct animals. In this regard, Zelda is a cuspal creature, two legs dog, two legs cat. For one thing, she does not bark, barking being a purely man-made function caused by the stresses put upon dogs by their colonists. No, Zelda yodels and yowls. She also washes herself and climbs trees. Jeez, but he misses Zelda. He wants to go home and dig his garden and bum around and smoke huge amounts of pot and think about what he's going to do next. I think maybe we'd better leave out the bit about the pot, in case they won't let him back into America. He thinks about it for a moment. His hands do their watch-mending thing, then he says, upfront and honest, \"I don't give a shit.\"",

      "body": "<p>A website called Ask Jeeves was not what Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse had in mind when he created his resourceful gentleman's gentleman. But, like any instant oracle, it has its uses. For one thing, it offers an intriguing insight into what keeps other people awake at night. According to one recent survey, the question most frequently asked of Jeeves was, \"Why do farts smell?\" Another favourite, for which the site has a ready-prepared answer, was, \"Why is poop brown?\" (The Americans have such a cute way with words.) It may not be the sort of topic that Bertie Wooster mulled over with his butler of an evening, but the rest of us, it seems, still get a buzz from talking dritty. </p> <p>Dritty? No, it's not a spelling error. A long time ago, when our language was still emerging from the long Icelandic winter, people used the word \"drit\" instead of \"poop\". The Old English \"gedriten\" meant to ... well, you can work it out. Eventually, \"drit\" thawed and softened into \"dirt\", and before long it covered everything in sight - everything that was in the least bit impure or that contaminated other things. </p> <p>Today, \"dirt\" still denotes dung and droppings. But it is also grime and grot, slobber and slime, soil and smut. Dirt is filth, but it is stain and tarnish, too. It is muck on the mat and mud on the carpet. And it is a layer of dust on a piano and the lightest of smudges on a sheet of white paper. </p> <p>Dirt echoes through our language and touches every aspect of our lives, from dirty looks to dirty dishes, from Dirty Harry to dirty videos. Why does it occupy such a prominent position in our consciousness? Perhaps because, when we say \"dirt\", we still think \"drit\". Our aversion to excrement (generations of untouchables were forced to live on the fringes of Indian society because they alone were responsible for emptying the latrines) is as universal as it is powerful. Yet drit will always be with us. </p> <p>Thus finishing his grand survey, <br>Disgusted Strephon stole away <br>Repeating in his amorous fits, <br>Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits! <br><strong> From The Lady's Dressing Room, by Jonathan Swift</strong> </p> <p>The concept of normality comes up quite frequently in any discussion of faeces. Normally, we excrete between three and six ounces a day - ie, four tonnes in the average lifetime. Normal faeces are three-quarters water. Of the remaining solids, as much as half can consist of dead bacteria. That's normal. What's left is made up of indigestible food, fats, protein and minerals. Then there is cell debris and dead blood cells, plus several powerful-smelling chemicals. One of these, skatole, takes it name from the Greek word for dung. </p> <p>If you can stand the stench of skatole, there's no medical reason why you shouldn't eat faeces (connoisseurs say that it tastes like ripe Camembert), provided that the person or animal who produced it isn't carrying a deadly virus or a troublesome parasite. Coprophagia is common among dogs, horses and, to a lesser degree, small children. Are they just trying to be helpful? </p> <p>The dung beetle, a kind of scarab, uses its head to form manure into a ball which can be as big as an apple. Then it buries itself in the ball and feeds on it, eating more than its own weight in 24 hours. In Egyptian cosmogony, the ball represented the earth and the beetle the sun. And that question about the colour? \"Stuff happens,\" says Jeeves. \"In fact, it happens all the time. Your body is always going through cycles - routines - all the time. One of them is the creation, use and re-use of blood cells. A chemical called bilirubin (bill-e-ROO-bin) is made when your body takes old blood cells apart. And bilirubin is brown.\" Thanks old chum. </p> <p>O thou shrouded in thy mantle, arise and warn! Thy Lord do thou magnify, thy robes purify and defilement flee! <br><strong> From the Koran, 74:1-4</strong> </p> <p>Until the 19th century, when scientists began to recognise that disease is caused by invisible organisms, personal hygiene was a hit-and-miss affair. If the well-to-do enjoyed bathing, it was generally for aesthetic reasons, or for fun. And then there was religion. Since earliest times, people have considered it expedient to purify themselves before their gods. That familiar line about cleanliness and godliness is often attributed to John Wesley, the co-founder of English Methodism. \"Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness,\" he said in a sermon about the need for Christians to dress smartly. But the preacher was referring to a Hebrew saying, believed to originate with the ancient rabbi Phinehas ben Yair. For not only did Moses pass on the Ten Commandments, but he also gave the Israelites detailed laws on cleanliness and religious purification. </p> <p>Even the origin of soap seems to be imbued with religious significance. According to Roman legend, it got its name from Mount Sapo, a popular spot for the sacrificing of animals. Whenever rain washed a mixture of melted fat and wood ashes down into the clay soil along the Tiber, women washing their clothes in the river were said to have found the job much easier if they used the soapy clay. </p> <p>Man does not live by soap alone; and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it - or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it. <br><strong> From All I Survey, by GK Chesterton, 1933</strong> </p> <p>The Phoenicians were preparing soap from goat tallow and wood ashes in 600BC (they used it to barter with the Gauls), and the Celts produced something similar, which they called \"saipo\" (so much for the Mount Sapo theory). But none of these people realised that they could use the stuff for washing. Until the 2nd century AD, soap was used either as a treatment for skin conditions or as a sort of hair gel. With the decline of the Pax Romana, Europe almost forgot about soap again. Some was still made around medieval Marseille, and later in Genoa and Venice. But even in 1672, a German sending a box of Italian soap to a Lady von Schleinitz felt it prudent to enclose a set of instructions as to its use. </p> <p>In England, the few soapmakers who did set up shop from the end of the 12th century were heavily taxed, and after the Napoleonic wars soap duty was jacked up so abruptly that soap-boiling pans had to be sealed by the tax collector at the end of each day in order to prevent illicit nocturnal production. When the tax was abolished in 1853, demand went through the roof. </p> <p>With soap so readily available, it was transformed from a luxury into a necessity, and the chemist Justus von Liebig was moved to remark that the civilisation of a nation could now be measured in terms of the quantity of soap it consumed. </p> <p>But when the first world war broke out, fat was needed for more important things. So, in 1916, German chemists developed synthetic detergents. In no time at all, the cracked, green lump at the end of the draining board had metamorphosed into a cupboardful of exciting cleaning products. So fierce was competition among rival manufacturers that in the 30s they began sponsoring daytime drama serials on US radio - and the term \"soap opera\" was born. </p> <p> Hygiene is the corruption of medicine by morality. <br><strong> From Prejudices, by HL Mencken, 1922</strong> </p> <p>Miasma is a strange and evocative word, but what does it evoke exactly? The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as, \"Infections or noxious exhalations from putrescent organic matter\". But in his award-winning book, Biography Of A Germ (Victor Gollancz, \u00a316.99), Arno Karlen goes into riveting detail. In the 1820s, he says, when deadly waves of cholera swept out of Bengal, \"most experts laughed at the notion that creatures too small to be seen could fell armies and turn cities into cemeteries\". Disease, these experts knew, \"was caused by miasmas, noxious vapours that arose from putrefying organic stuff\". </p> <p>As it happened, this false belief fuelled England's sanitary reform movement, led by Sir Edwin Chadwick. \"They collected refuse, tore down hovels, built sewers and pulled dead dogs from the water supply. It was the beginning of something we now take for granted, massive government intervention to protect public health.\" </p> <p>When cholera again struck England in 1866, there were far fewer infections, which seemed to confirm Chadwick's theory that dirt caused disease. \"What the reformers actually proved,\" says Karlen, \"was that good results can flow from flawed theories; some kinds of dirt might invite and spread cholera, but they were not the cause. Therefore sanitation could reduce the epidemic but not eliminate it.\" </p> <p>Not until 1883 did Robert Koch isolate the bacterium that caused cholera, and so settle the thing once and for all. Yet, says Karlen, the equation of dirt with disease did not die. Rather, dirt and disease both became associated with microbes. \"There persisted an old magical association of epidemics with physical and moral filth.\" </p> <p>By the 20th century, most people accepted the germ theory, yet we still tell children \"that dirt and germs are synonymous, and that both will make them sick\". </p> <p> A disease known is half cured. <br><strong> From Gnomologia, by Thomas Fuller MD, 1732</strong> </p> <p>Many people - Koch, Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur to name but three - helped to establish our present understanding of germs, dirt, contagion and disease. But the work of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis most clearly illustrates the difficulties faced by these pioneers. </p> <p>In 1844, Semmelweis took up the post of assistant at the obstetric clinic in Vienna, and soon came up against the problem of childbed fever. Right across Europe, puerperal infection regularly killed a quarter to a third of women who for one reason or another had to give birth in a maternity hospital. It was assumed that overcrowding, poor ventilation and miasma were the cause, and Semmelweis was discouraged from investigating further. But he couldn't help noticing that, in the section of the clinic staffed by midwives, the death rate was three times lower than in an identical section staffed by students. The students, he realised, were coming straight from the dissecting room to the maternity ward, bringing to healthy women the infection from mothers who had died of the disease. When he insisted that students disinfect their hands before each examination, the mortality rates dropped from 18.27% to 1.27%. But although his younger colleagues understood the significance of his discovery, Semmelweis found himself in trouble with his boss. </p> <p>For 20 years, he struggled to get his ideas accepted. One day, while he was performing an operation, a wound on his right hand became infected. In 1865 he suffered a breakdown and later died in a mental hospital of the same disease that he had fought all his life to control. After his death, medical science saw that Semmelweis had been right all along, and Lister subsequently paid tribute to his achievement: \"It fills me with joy,\" he said, \"that at last he is given the respect due to him.\" </p> <p>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. <br><strong> From Genesis, 3:19</strong> </p> <p>Isn't it incredible how much dirt people bring into the house in the course of a day? All that soil and sand on their shoes. Then there's the dust that blows in from the street, the filth that comes in through the open window. And just look what the cat brought in ... </p> <p>Incredible? Quite unbelievable, in fact, since most household dirt is generated on the premises, by the creatures who live there. Between 75% and 80% of vacuum cleaner dirt consists of human skin cells - the dead bits we shed every time we move. The remainder contains hair and animal dander, plus the dust mites that feed on it. Oh, and there's the odd bit of grot that comes in on our shoes. </p> <p>The thing I hated most was the cockroaches. They lived in the lining of the fridge door, and every time you opened the fridge you set them off. Sometimes, it was half an hour before the noise died down. <br><strong> Friend of a friend, recalling student life in America</strong> </p> <p>The word cockroach comes from the Spanish \"cucaracha\" (remember those car horns that used to play La Cucaracha?). Such a jolly name for something that is universally regarded as one of the most loathsome of all household pests. There are more than 3,500 species, yet although only a few are pests, these few have given all cockroaches a bad name. Roaches eat both plant and animal products - anything from paper, clothing and books to dead insects (they are particularly fond of bedbugs). But like foxes, they damage more than they eat. And they smell awful. </p> <p>We are so often ashamed of the Earth - the soil of it, the sweat of it, the good common coarseness of it. To us in our fine raiment and soft manners, it seems indelicate. <br><strong> From Adventures In Contentment, by David Grayson, 1907</strong> </p> <p>Soil is packed full of bacteria. In a single tablespoonful, there are reckoned to be more bacteria than there are human beings on the planet. Capable of existing in extremes of heat or cold and without sunlight, they perform many functions vital to higher life forms, taking nitrogen from the air and converting it into the nitrates needed by plants, and breaking down organic material by soaking it in secreted enzymes and absorbing the result. Almost any material placed in soil will eventually be eaten by bacteria; a few years ago, scientists helping to clean up after a diesel oil spill were delighted to discover that the ground was full of fuel-eating bacteria known as pseudomonas. Research is currently underway to develop methods of purifying contaminated soil using these bacteria, which are so tiny that 50 of them could line up end-to-end across the cutting edge of a piece of paper. </p> <p>There are over 15 million wheelie bins in the UK and this number is growing daily. Quite simply VIP has developed their bin cleaning service to meet the demands of millions of households who use wheelie bins ... <br><strong> Advert for bin cleaning franchise opportunity</strong> </p> <p>Remember the turkey you ate last Christmas? Ever wonder what became of the carcass - or the one before that and the one before that? Chances are, they're all buried deep inside some worked-out gravel pit in Essex, bubbling away nicely, out of sight and out of mind. Each year in the UK, municipal dustcarts collect 28m tonnes of waste, and more than 80% of this ends up in landfill sites. These have come on a bit since the days when contractors simply chucked the rubbish into a hole and covered it with soil. The industry literature talks of clay-lined cells, of entombment landfill and bio-flushing reactor systems. But still nobody is exactly sure what goes on down there - or how long it takes for our rubbish to disappear. </p> <p>Research suggests that three phases of decomposition take place. The first uses up the oxygen buried with the waste, and is all over in less than a month. Next, a variety of micro-organisms start to eat the putrescent material, breaking it down into volatile fatty acids, alcohols and ammonia. This can take years or even decades. Finally, slow-acting bacteria begin digesting these substances to produce carbon dioxide and methane gas - a process which can last for many decades or even centuries. </p> <p>\"Methane is the worst of the greenhouse gases,\" says Sarah Oppenheimer at Friends of the Earth (FoE). \"It is eight times more potent than carbon dioxide. So not only are landfill sites a waste of resources, unsustainable and horrible to live near, but they are also bad for climate change.\" </p> <p>From next year, the European Landfill Directive will force site operators to flare off methane or use it to generate electricity. But it will also insist on a huge reduction in tipping. But the alternative is likely to be incineration, which FoE also opposes on health, pollution and climate grounds. \"Scores of new, large-scale incinerators are already popping up all over the country,\" says Oppenheimer. \"Yet up to 80% of household waste is compostable or recyclable.\" Something to bear in mind next time you get the wishbone. </p> <p>I was seized by the stern hand of Compulsion, that dark, unseasonable Urge that impels women to clean house in the middle of the night. <br><strong> From Alarms And Diversions, by James Thurber</strong> </p> <p>It wasn't easy being Howard Hughes. Billionaire he may have been, but by 1958, he was reduced to living naked in a corner of his Beverly Hills hotel room, handling everything with wads of tissue and dictating memos on the most hygienic way to open a tin of pineapple. Hughes was terrified of germs, and this, with its associated handwashing, is probably the most common manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), along with an overwhelming desire for tidiness. </p> <p>Around one in 30 people is reckoned to suffer from one or another form of OCD. Some have had the condition since birth, and most suffer in secret. But when the obsession is with personal hygiene and a fear of contamination, serious sufferers can wind up in hospital. At what point does fastidiousness tip over into obsessiveness? </p> <p>Colin Putney, of the charity Obsessive Action, reckons that when people begin acting in a ritualised way, it is time to seek help. \"Obviously there's normal cleanliness,\" he says, \"and there are people who are particularly clean. Then there are people who have to have everything just so, and if anything is moved, they get upset. This is borderline. Then you go beyond that into people who conduct daily rituals. If it involves rituals, that's OCD. It's out of control and it needs treatment. Because, if it's left untreated, it gets worse.\" </p> <p>But help is at hand, says Putney. Both pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, as well as self-help for sufferers and their families. </p> <p>'There won't be any revolution in America,' said Isadore. Nikitin agreed. 'The people are too clean. They spend all their time changing their shirts and washing themselves. You can't feel fierce and revolutionary in a bathroom.' <br><strong> From Juan In America, by Eric Linklater</strong> </p> <p>Worried about pongy feet? Slip on some antibacterial socks. Concerned about the state of your bedlinen? Perhaps you need an antibacterial quilt with matching pillow. There is talk of antibacterial chequebooks and antibacterial steering wheel covers. And with so much talk of food poisoning, you certainly need antibacterial cutting boards, surface cleaners, sponges and soaps. </p> <p>Or do you? What if this stuff is upsetting the balance of nature? What if it is causing superbugs? In 1997, supermarket giant J Sainsbury signed an exclusive deal with a US-based company called Microban that had come up with a clever way of incorporating the microbial inhibitor triclosan into a variety of plastics. Suddenly, supermarket shelves were filled with all manner of kitchen utensils whose surfaces were said to discourage bugs from multiplying. </p> <p>To those who claim it doesn't work, Micro-ban's champions point to all sorts of glowing test results. The Leatherhead Food Research Association, for example, contaminated treated and untreated conveyor belts with Escherichia coli , Salmonella enteriditis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus - all major players in any number of food-poisoning outbreaks in recent years. The results were impressive. </p> <p>To those who accept that these products are effective, but who fear that, by suppressing the little bugs, they are opening the door to far nastier varieties, the industry says that, if this were going to happen, it would have been apparent in the 30 years since triclosan began appearing in toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant and soap, as well as any number of antibacterial agents widely used in hospitals. Antibiotics may have given rise to drug-resistant germs, but not triclosan. </p> <p>\"The emergence of resistant bacteria is widely attributed by public-health experts to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics,\" says a joint statement from the US Soap and Detergent Association and the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. \"Hospitals use antibacterial products every day to stop the spread of bacteria, including resistant bacteria.\" </p> <p>What separates two people most profoundly is a different sense and degree of cleanliness. <br><strong> From Beyond Good And Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886</strong> </p> <p>When scientists at Bristol University asked mothers in the West Country how frequently they washed their children, the figures that came back showed huge variations. But when they compared these levels of hygiene with the children's health, the results were even more startling. Ultra-clean children, it seems, are more likely to suffer from allergies. As part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, which will monitor the health of nearly 11,000 newborn babies as they grow into adults, Andrea Sherriff and a team at the Institute of Child Health graded the children according to how often they were washed in a day, then logged any occurrence of wheezing or skin rashes in their first 42 months. \"They were given scores of between zero and 14,\" says Sherriff. \"Zero meant they were practically never washed and 14 meant they were having their face and hands washed more than five times a day, always had their hands washed before meals, and were given a bath or shower more than once a day.\" </p> <p>No fewer than 43 children scored 14. \"These wee souls were having quite extraordinary levels of hygiene in the home,\" says Sherriff. \"And it was the ultra-hygienic children who were statistically more likely to get allergies.\" It occurred to the researchers that mothers who wash their children that frequently might also be using a lot of detergents, bleach, air fresheners and polish in the home, and that these chemicals might be responsible for the wheezing and skin conditions. But even when they built these factors into the statistical model, the allergies could still be related to the washing. </p> <p>Although the results have yet to be submitted for peer review, advanced publicity has already caused some indignation. But Sherriff insists that nobody wants to see a u-turn in personal hygiene. \"There would be huge public health implications if people sent their children out to play in the dirt and not wash them,\" she says. \"We would see all sorts of diseases that we've managed to eradicate because of our improved hygiene and sanitation and diet. But, on the other hand, our immune system has evolved to deal with day-to-day bacteria, and now that we live in this sort of semi-sterile environment our immune systems are not getting the stimulus they need at an early age.\" </p> <p> Man and other civilised animals are the only creatures that ever become dirty.<br><strong> From A Thousand-Mile Walk To The Gulf, by John Muir</strong> </p> <p>It's called the Hygiene Hypothesis, and it has been around for a while. In its crudest form - in newspaper headline terms - it says that dirt is good for you. But it is a little more complicated than that. Professor Graham Rook, an immunologist at University College London and one of the chief proponents of the hypothesis, explains: \"The thinking is that it's actually exposure to bacteria - particularly bacteria that have always been there throughout our evolutionary history - that is what turns on the immune system's regulatory path. We're just not getting exposed enough to these environmental bacteria any more. Living on concrete is not providing an input to the immune system which is actually required.\" </p> <p>More and more research such as that carried out in Avon is feeding into the hypothesis, says Rook. \"A Peruvian guy showed that, if you vacuum up the house dust in people's homes and then measure the amount of endotoxin in it - endotoxin is an easily measurable component of certain types of bacteria - you find that the more endotoxin there is, the less people are allergically sensitised to their house dust. In fact, all the epidemiology is now fitting this notion. There are several studies showing that, if you were brought up on a farm, you are less likely to be allergic. If you keep a dog - dogs go out and get covered in soil, then get wet and shake themselves around your house - you're less likely to be allergic.\" </p> <p>Rook believes the hypothesis applies not only to allergic responses such as asthma and eczema, but also to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type one diabetes and inflammatory bowels diseases, all of which are becoming more common in the squeaky-clean northern hemisphere. </p> <p>In evolutionary terms, says Rook, it adds up. \"When oxygen first appeared on this planet, some organisms adapted to live with it, and of course oxygen is now a necessity. Similarly, we can read off in the human genome the influence of bacteria on it. These bugs have had an impact on us. Basically, for 99.9% of our evolution we were hunter-gatherers, and every time we felt thirsty we went to the waterhole like the hippos did, and basically we lived in mud. So soil organisms are very much a part of our physiology. </p> <p>\"But we can't go backwards. Obviously, hygiene and antibiotics are the two most useful things that have been achieved for mankind. What we do need to do is work out what we are no longer getting from the environment that we actually need, and then put it back.

      "bodyText": "A website called Ask Jeeves was not what Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse had in mind when he created his resourceful gentleman's gentleman. But, like any instant oracle, it has its uses. For one thing, it offers an intriguing insight into what keeps other people awake at night. According to one recent survey, the question most frequently asked of Jeeves was, \"Why do farts smell?\" Another favourite, for which the site has a ready-prepared answer, was, \"Why is poop brown?\" (The Americans have such a cute way with words.) It may not be the sort of topic that Bertie Wooster mulled over with his butler of an evening, but the rest of us, it seems, still get a buzz from talking dritty. Dritty? No, it's not a spelling error. A long time ago, when our language was still emerging from the long Icelandic winter, people used the word \"drit\" instead of \"poop\". The Old English \"gedriten\" meant to ... well, you can work it out. Eventually, \"drit\" thawed and softened into \"dirt\", and before long it covered everything in sight - everything that was in the least bit impure or that contaminated other things. Today, \"dirt\" still denotes dung and droppings. But it is also grime and grot, slobber and slime, soil and smut. Dirt is filth, but it is stain and tarnish, too. It is muck on the mat and mud on the carpet. And it is a layer of dust on a piano and the lightest of smudges on a sheet of white paper. Dirt echoes through our language and touches every aspect of our lives, from dirty looks to dirty dishes, from Dirty Harry to dirty videos. Why does it occupy such a prominent position in our consciousness? Perhaps because, when we say \"dirt\", we still think \"drit\". Our aversion to excrement (generations of untouchables were forced to live on the fringes of Indian society because they alone were responsible for emptying the latrines) is as universal as it is powerful. Yet drit will always be with us. Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon stole away Repeating in his amorous fits, Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits! From The Lady's Dressing Room, by Jonathan Swift The concept of normality comes up quite frequently in any discussion of faeces. Normally, we excrete between three and six ounces a day - ie, four tonnes in the average lifetime. Normal faeces are three-quarters water. Of the remaining solids, as much as half can consist of dead bacteria. That's normal. What's left is made up of indigestible food, fats, protein and minerals. Then there is cell debris and dead blood cells, plus several powerful-smelling chemicals. One of these, skatole, takes it name from the Greek word for dung. If you can stand the stench of skatole, there's no medical reason why you shouldn't eat faeces (connoisseurs say that it tastes like ripe Camembert), provided that the person or animal who produced it isn't carrying a deadly virus or a troublesome parasite. Coprophagia is common among dogs, horses and, to a lesser degree, small children. Are they just trying to be helpful? The dung beetle, a kind of scarab, uses its head to form manure into a ball which can be as big as an apple. Then it buries itself in the ball and feeds on it, eating more than its own weight in 24 hours. In Egyptian cosmogony, the ball represented the earth and the beetle the sun. And that question about the colour? \"Stuff happens,\" says Jeeves. \"In fact, it happens all the time. Your body is always going through cycles - routines - all the time. One of them is the creation, use and re-use of blood cells. A chemical called bilirubin (bill-e-ROO-bin) is made when your body takes old blood cells apart. And bilirubin is brown.\" Thanks old chum. O thou shrouded in thy mantle, arise and warn! Thy Lord do thou magnify, thy robes purify and defilement flee! From the Koran, 74:1-4 Until the 19th century, when scientists began to recognise that disease is caused by invisible organisms, personal hygiene was a hit-and-miss affair. If the well-to-do enjoyed bathing, it was generally for aesthetic reasons, or for fun. And then there was religion. Since earliest times, people have considered it expedient to purify themselves before their gods. That familiar line about cleanliness and godliness is often attributed to John Wesley, the co-founder of English Methodism. \"Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness,\" he said in a sermon about the need for Christians to dress smartly. But the preacher was referring to a Hebrew saying, believed to originate with the ancient rabbi Phinehas ben Yair. For not only did Moses pass on the Ten Commandments, but he also gave the Israelites detailed laws on cleanliness and religious purification. Even the origin of soap seems to be imbued with religious significance. According to Roman legend, it got its name from Mount Sapo, a popular spot for the sacrificing of animals. Whenever rain washed a mixture of melted fat and wood ashes down into the clay soil along the Tiber, women washing their clothes in the river were said to have found the job much easier if they used the soapy clay. Man does not live by soap alone; and hygiene, or even health, is not much good unless you can take a healthy view of it - or, better still, feel a healthy indifference to it. From All I Survey, by GK Chesterton, 1933 The Phoenicians were preparing soap from goat tallow and wood ashes in 600BC (they used it to barter with the Gauls), and the Celts produced something similar, which they called \"saipo\" (so much for the Mount Sapo theory). But none of these people realised that they could use the stuff for washing. Until the 2nd century AD, soap was used either as a treatment for skin conditions or as a sort of hair gel. With the decline of the Pax Romana, Europe almost forgot about soap again. Some was still made around medieval Marseille, and later in Genoa and Venice. But even in 1672, a German sending a box of Italian soap to a Lady von Schleinitz felt it prudent to enclose a set of instructions as to its use. In England, the few soapmakers who did set up shop from the end of the 12th century were heavily taxed, and after the Napoleonic wars soap duty was jacked up so abruptly that soap-boiling pans had to be sealed by the tax collector at the end of each day in order to prevent illicit nocturnal production. When the tax was abolished in 1853, demand went through the roof. With soap so readily available, it was transformed from a luxury into a necessity, and the chemist Justus von Liebig was moved to remark that the civilisation of a nation could now be measured in terms of the quantity of soap it consumed. But when the first world war broke out, fat was needed for more important things. So, in 1916, German chemists developed synthetic detergents. In no time at all, the cracked, green lump at the end of the draining board had metamorphosed into a cupboardful of exciting cleaning products. So fierce was competition among rival manufacturers that in the 30s they began sponsoring daytime drama serials on US radio - and the term \"soap opera\" was born. Hygiene is the corruption of medicine by morality. From Prejudices, by HL Mencken, 1922 Miasma is a strange and evocative word, but what does it evoke exactly? The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as, \"Infections or noxious exhalations from putrescent organic matter\". But in his award-winning book, Biography Of A Germ (Victor Gollancz, \u00a316.99), Arno Karlen goes into riveting detail. In the 1820s, he says, when deadly waves of cholera swept out of Bengal, \"most experts laughed at the notion that creatures too small to be seen could fell armies and turn cities into cemeteries\". Disease, these experts knew, \"was caused by miasmas, noxious vapours that arose from putrefying organic stuff\". As it happened, this false belief fuelled England's sanitary reform movement, led by Sir Edwin Chadwick. \"They collected refuse, tore down hovels, built sewers and pulled dead dogs from the water supply. It was the beginning of something we now take for granted, massive government intervention to protect public health.\" When cholera again struck England in 1866, there were far fewer infections, which seemed to confirm Chadwick's theory that dirt caused disease. \"What the reformers actually proved,\" says Karlen, \"was that good results can flow from flawed theories; some kinds of dirt might invite and spread cholera, but they were not the cause. Therefore sanitation could reduce the epidemic but not eliminate it.\" Not until 1883 did Robert Koch isolate the bacterium that caused cholera, and so settle the thing once and for all. Yet, says Karlen, the equation of dirt with disease did not die. Rather, dirt and disease both became associated with microbes. \"There persisted an old magical association of epidemics with physical and moral filth.\" By the 20th century, most people accepted the germ theory, yet we still tell children \"that dirt and germs are synonymous, and that both will make them sick\". A disease known is half cured. From Gnomologia, by Thomas Fuller MD, 1732 Many people - Koch, Joseph Lister and Louis Pasteur to name but three - helped to establish our present understanding of germs, dirt, contagion and disease. But the work of the Hungarian physician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis most clearly illustrates the difficulties faced by these pioneers. In 1844, Semmelweis took up the post of assistant at the obstetric clinic in Vienna, and soon came up against the problem of childbed fever. Right across Europe, puerperal infection regularly killed a quarter to a third of women who for one reason or another had to give birth in a maternity hospital. It was assumed that overcrowding, poor ventilation and miasma were the cause, and Semmelweis was discouraged from investigating further. But he couldn't help noticing that, in the section of the clinic staffed by midwives, the death rate was three times lower than in an identical section staffed by students. The students, he realised, were coming straight from the dissecting room to the maternity ward, bringing to healthy women the infection from mothers who had died of the disease. When he insisted that students disinfect their hands before each examination, the mortality rates dropped from 18.27% to 1.27%. But although his younger colleagues understood the significance of his discovery, Semmelweis found himself in trouble with his boss. For 20 years, he struggled to get his ideas accepted. One day, while he was performing an operation, a wound on his right hand became infected. In 1865 he suffered a breakdown and later died in a mental hospital of the same disease that he had fought all his life to control. After his death, medical science saw that Semmelweis had been right all along, and Lister subsequently paid tribute to his achievement: \"It fills me with joy,\" he said, \"that at last he is given the respect due to him.\" Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. From Genesis, 3:19 Isn't it incredible how much dirt people bring into the house in the course of a day? All that soil and sand on their shoes. Then there's the dust that blows in from the street, the filth that comes in through the open window. And just look what the cat brought in ... Incredible? Quite unbelievable, in fact, since most household dirt is generated on the premises, by the creatures who live there. Between 75% and 80% of vacuum cleaner dirt consists of human skin cells - the dead bits we shed every time we move. The remainder contains hair and animal dander, plus the dust mites that feed on it. Oh, and there's the odd bit of grot that comes in on our shoes. The thing I hated most was the cockroaches. They lived in the lining of the fridge door, and every time you opened the fridge you set them off. Sometimes, it was half an hour before the noise died down. Friend of a friend, recalling student life in America The word cockroach comes from the Spanish \"cucaracha\" (remember those car horns that used to play La Cucaracha?). Such a jolly name for something that is universally regarded as one of the most loathsome of all household pests. There are more than 3,500 species, yet although only a few are pests, these few have given all cockroaches a bad name. Roaches eat both plant and animal products - anything from paper, clothing and books to dead insects (they are particularly fond of bedbugs). But like foxes, they damage more than they eat. And they smell awful. We are so often ashamed of the Earth - the soil of it, the sweat of it, the good common coarseness of it. To us in our fine raiment and soft manners, it seems indelicate. From Adventures In Contentment, by David Grayson, 1907 Soil is packed full of bacteria. In a single tablespoonful, there are reckoned to be more bacteria than there are human beings on the planet. Capable of existing in extremes of heat or cold and without sunlight, they perform many functions vital to higher life forms, taking nitrogen from the air and converting it into the nitrates needed by plants, and breaking down organic material by soaking it in secreted enzymes and absorbing the result. Almost any material placed in soil will eventually be eaten by bacteria; a few years ago, scientists helping to clean up after a diesel oil spill were delighted to discover that the ground was full of fuel-eating bacteria known as pseudomonas. Research is currently underway to develop methods of purifying contaminated soil using these bacteria, which are so tiny that 50 of them could line up end-to-end across the cutting edge of a piece of paper. There are over 15 million wheelie bins in the UK and this number is growing daily. Quite simply VIP has developed their bin cleaning service to meet the demands of millions of households who use wheelie bins ... Advert for bin cleaning franchise opportunity Remember the turkey you ate last Christmas? Ever wonder what became of the carcass - or the one before that and the one before that? Chances are, they're all buried deep inside some worked-out gravel pit in Essex, bubbling away nicely, out of sight and out of mind. Each year in the UK, municipal dustcarts collect 28m tonnes of waste, and more than 80% of this ends up in landfill sites. These have come on a bit since the days when contractors simply chucked the rubbish into a hole and covered it with soil. The industry literature talks of clay-lined cells, of entombment landfill and bio-flushing reactor systems. But still nobody is exactly sure what goes on down there - or how long it takes for our rubbish to disappear. Research suggests that three phases of decomposition take place. The first uses up the oxygen buried with the waste, and is all over in less than a month. Next, a variety of micro-organisms start to eat the putrescent material, breaking it down into volatile fatty acids, alcohols and ammonia. This can take years or even decades. Finally, slow-acting bacteria begin digesting these substances to produce carbon dioxide and methane gas - a process which can last for many decades or even centuries. \"Methane is the worst of the greenhouse gases,\" says Sarah Oppenheimer at Friends of the Earth (FoE). \"It is eight times more potent than carbon dioxide. So not only are landfill sites a waste of resources, unsustainable and horrible to live near, but they are also bad for climate change.\" From next year, the European Landfill Directive will force site operators to flare off methane or use it to generate electricity. But it will also insist on a huge reduction in tipping. But the alternative is likely to be incineration, which FoE also opposes on health, pollution and climate grounds. \"Scores of new, large-scale incinerators are already popping up all over the country,\" says Oppenheimer. \"Yet up to 80% of household waste is compostable or recyclable.\" Something to bear in mind next time you get the wishbone. I was seized by the stern hand of Compulsion, that dark, unseasonable Urge that impels women to clean house in the middle of the night. From Alarms And Diversions, by James Thurber It wasn't easy being Howard Hughes. Billionaire he may have been, but by 1958, he was reduced to living naked in a corner of his Beverly Hills hotel room, handling everything with wads of tissue and dictating memos on the most hygienic way to open a tin of pineapple. Hughes was terrified of germs, and this, with its associated handwashing, is probably the most common manifestation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), along with an overwhelming desire for tidiness. Around one in 30 people is reckoned to suffer from one or another form of OCD. Some have had the condition since birth, and most suffer in secret. But when the obsession is with personal hygiene and a fear of contamination, serious sufferers can wind up in hospital. At what point does fastidiousness tip over into obsessiveness? Colin Putney, of the charity Obsessive Action, reckons that when people begin acting in a ritualised way, it is time to seek help. \"Obviously there's normal cleanliness,\" he says, \"and there are people who are particularly clean. Then there are people who have to have everything just so, and if anything is moved, they get upset. This is borderline. Then you go beyond that into people who conduct daily rituals. If it involves rituals, that's OCD. It's out of control and it needs treatment. Because, if it's left untreated, it gets worse.\" But help is at hand, says Putney. Both pharmacological and psychological treatments are available, as well as self-help for sufferers and their families. 'There won't be any revolution in America,' said Isadore. Nikitin agreed. 'The people are too clean. They spend all their time changing their shirts and washing themselves. You can't feel fierce and revolutionary in a bathroom.' From Juan In America, by Eric Linklater Worried about pongy feet? Slip on some antibacterial socks. Concerned about the state of your bedlinen? Perhaps you need an antibacterial quilt with matching pillow. There is talk of antibacterial chequebooks and antibacterial steering wheel covers. And with so much talk of food poisoning, you certainly need antibacterial cutting boards, surface cleaners, sponges and soaps. Or do you? What if this stuff is upsetting the balance of nature? What if it is causing superbugs? In 1997, supermarket giant J Sainsbury signed an exclusive deal with a US-based company called Microban that had come up with a clever way of incorporating the microbial inhibitor triclosan into a variety of plastics. Suddenly, supermarket shelves were filled with all manner of kitchen utensils whose surfaces were said to discourage bugs from multiplying. To those who claim it doesn't work, Micro-ban's champions point to all sorts of glowing test results. The Leatherhead Food Research Association, for example, contaminated treated and untreated conveyor belts with Escherichia coli , Salmonella enteriditis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus - all major players in any number of food-poisoning outbreaks in recent years. The results were impressive. To those who accept that these products are effective, but who fear that, by suppressing the little bugs, they are opening the door to far nastier varieties, the industry says that, if this were going to happen, it would have been apparent in the 30 years since triclosan began appearing in toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorant and soap, as well as any number of antibacterial agents widely used in hospitals. Antibiotics may have given rise to drug-resistant germs, but not triclosan. \"The emergence of resistant bacteria is widely attributed by public-health experts to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics,\" says a joint statement from the US Soap and Detergent Association and the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. \"Hospitals use antibacterial products every day to stop the spread of bacteria, including resistant bacteria.\" What separates two people most profoundly is a different sense and degree of cleanliness. From Beyond Good And Evil, by Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886 When scientists at Bristol University asked mothers in the West Country how frequently they washed their children, the figures that came back showed huge variations. But when they compared these levels of hygiene with the children's health, the results were even more startling. Ultra-clean children, it seems, are more likely to suffer from allergies. As part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, which will monitor the health of nearly 11,000 newborn babies as they grow into adults, Andrea Sherriff and a team at the Institute of Child Health graded the children according to how often they were washed in a day, then logged any occurrence of wheezing or skin rashes in their first 42 months. \"They were given scores of between zero and 14,\" says Sherriff. \"Zero meant they were practically never washed and 14 meant they were having their face and hands washed more than five times a day, always had their hands washed before meals, and were given a bath or shower more than once a day.\" No fewer than 43 children scored 14. \"These wee souls were having quite extraordinary levels of hygiene in the home,\" says Sherriff. \"And it was the ultra-hygienic children who were statistically more likely to get allergies.\" It occurred to the researchers that mothers who wash their children that frequently might also be using a lot of detergents, bleach, air fresheners and polish in the home, and that these chemicals might be responsible for the wheezing and skin conditions. But even when they built these factors into the statistical model, the allergies could still be related to the washing. Although the results have yet to be submitted for peer review, advanced publicity has already caused some indignation. But Sherriff insists that nobody wants to see a u-turn in personal hygiene. \"There would be huge public health implications if people sent their children out to play in the dirt and not wash them,\" she says. \"We would see all sorts of diseases that we've managed to eradicate because of our improved hygiene and sanitation and diet. But, on the other hand, our immune system has evolved to deal with day-to-day bacteria, and now that we live in this sort of semi-sterile environment our immune systems are not getting the stimulus they need at an early age.\" Man and other civilised animals are the only creatures that ever become dirty. From A Thousand-Mile Walk To The Gulf, by John Muir It's called the Hygiene Hypothesis, and it has been around for a while. In its crudest form - in newspaper headline terms - it says that dirt is good for you. But it is a little more complicated than that. Professor Graham Rook, an immunologist at University College London and one of the chief proponents of the hypothesis, explains: \"The thinking is that it's actually exposure to bacteria - particularly bacteria that have always been there throughout our evolutionary history - that is what turns on the immune system's regulatory path. We're just not getting exposed enough to these environmental bacteria any more. Living on concrete is not providing an input to the immune system which is actually required.\" More and more research such as that carried out in Avon is feeding into the hypothesis, says Rook. \"A Peruvian guy showed that, if you vacuum up the house dust in people's homes and then measure the amount of endotoxin in it - endotoxin is an easily measurable component of certain types of bacteria - you find that the more endotoxin there is, the less people are allergically sensitised to their house dust. In fact, all the epidemiology is now fitting this notion. There are several studies showing that, if you were brought up on a farm, you are less likely to be allergic. If you keep a dog - dogs go out and get covered in soil, then get wet and shake themselves around your house - you're less likely to be allergic.\" Rook believes the hypothesis applies not only to allergic responses such as asthma and eczema, but also to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type one diabetes and inflammatory bowels diseases, all of which are becoming more common in the squeaky-clean northern hemisphere. In evolutionary terms, says Rook, it adds up. \"When oxygen first appeared on this planet, some organisms adapted to live with it, and of course oxygen is now a necessity. Similarly, we can read off in the human genome the influence of bacteria on it. These bugs have had an impact on us. Basically, for 99.9% of our evolution we were hunter-gatherers, and every time we felt thirsty we went to the waterhole like the hippos did, and basically we lived in mud. So soil organisms are very much a part of our physiology. \"But we can't go backwards. Obviously, hygiene and antibiotics are the two most useful things that have been achieved for mankind. What we do need to do is work out what we are no longer getting from the environment that we actually need, and then put it back. It could be put back in the food, it could be sprayed in the environment, we could have little inhalers, or we could make new vaccines. \"But I'm not sure that people need to alter their behaviour very much. We don't really want kids eating faeces and cat droppings. A little bit of garden soil doesn't do you any harm - in fact, it's good for you. The problem is that it depends on whether it's the bit of the garden soil that the neighbour's cat crapped on.\" Dirt, then, gets a clean bill of health. But drit is quite another matter. \u0095 For further help and information about obsessive-compulsive disorder, or to help sufferers by sending a donation, write to Obsessive Action, Aberdeen Centre, 22-24 Highbury Grove, London N5 2EA.

      "body": "<p>In 1920, Walter Gropius circulated a memo to the professors at his year-old Bauhaus in Weimar, prescribing that women students be directed towards studies in weaving, pottery or bookbinding. Other options, such as metalwork and even painting, were seen as inappropriate. The pottery workshop bent over backwards not to take women. In 1922, the bookbinding workshop closed. That pretty much left weaving. </p> <p>Gunta St\u00f6lzl, who died in Switzerland in 1983, was one of the first students at the Bauhaus when it opened in 1919. She had already studied painting, ceramics and art history in Munich before the first world war, and she was no doubt attracted to the new school by its aims to break down the barriers between arts and crafts. It already had an impressive roster of teachers, too, such as Johannes Itten (the eccentric master colourist who dressed in monkish robes). </p> <p>St\u00f6lzl studied at the Bauhaus, then eventually taught there - until tittle-tattle about so-called \"improprieties\" forced her to resign in 1930. In 1927, she had taken over the running of the weaving workshop, an appointment that was hugely popular among her students, but by no means throughout the Bauhaus. She was the only woman to head a department; even so, she was paid less than the men and never became a professor. Now, after years in the shadows, her work - as one of the most talented and original textile designers and weavers of the 20th century - is finally being recognised. </p> <p>And realised. From her years at the Bauhaus, St\u00f6lzl left a number of impressive designs. Rug designers and makers Christopher Farr and Matthew Bourne have already produced a first collection of eight of these, which are currently on show at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Now, they are turning their attention to a second. </p> <p>Very few of St\u00f6lzl's designs were made during the Bauhaus years; most remained as deceptively simple watercolour sketches. Even in this form, they have an extraordinary vibrancy and life to them: a playfulness that reminds you of Paul Klee, combined with a virtuoso handling of colour and discipline of structure. </p> <p>\"Jack Lenor Larsen, the great American textiles man, suggested about five years ago that we produce St\u00f6lzl's designs,\" says Farr. \"Despite having been at art school myself, I hadn't heard of her at the time. It became clear when I spoke to her younger daughter, Monika Stadler, that Gunta was not a pushy type. She would have been pretty horrified at the way designers promote themselves today. The quest for fame would have been abhorrent to her. For her, the work was everything ... Part of what this project has taught me is how arbitrary art and design history is. It's just a matter of where the spotlight goes.\" </p> <p>Working closely with Stadler and her older sister, Yael Aloni, Farr started work. Despite having St\u00f6lzl's finished designs in front of him, the process was not straightforward. \"Watercolour has its own laws,\" he points out. \"Everything becomes different when you turn it into wool. So you find yourself making qualitative decisions all the way through.\" </p> <p>Stadler helped out with the choice of colours, negotiating her way through the variations in shade apparent in the original sketches. Other decisions had to be made: St\u00f6lzl had left no indication of an intended scale for the designs, for example, so again they had to work on instinct. \"This is probably the most challenging thing we've ever done,\" Farr says. \"As we got deeper into it, we realised how important St\u00f6lzl was to 20th-century design. She wasn't just a footnote. We felt a huge sense of responsibility to make something as inspiring as we had found the original designs.\" The obvious care and attention that Farr and his colleagues have lavished on getting the rugs just right is a fitting tribute to St\u00f6lzl. </p> <p>Had anyone taken the trouble to recognise it at the time, St\u00f6lzl was exactly the sort of artist that the Bauhaus had aimed to produce. She combined artistic brilliance with technical know-how, the latter mostly achieved, it would seem, from her own hard work and willingness to experiment on the looms, rather than from particularly thorough training. Her weaving workshop also successfully sold designs to industry, thus fulfilling another of Gropius's aims for the Bauhaus. </p> <p>When St\u00f6lzl became a teacher, she said that students should have \"a love for the material, imagination, a good feeling for colour, patience, perseverance, originality and flexibility of the mind as well of the hand\" - a fair summation of her own talents. </p> <p>\"You can tell she's got Klee and Kandinsky in her head,\" says Farr (both artists who taught at the Bauhaus). \"But, as a designer, I can see that she is honestly digesting an influence and coming out with something entirely her own\" </p> <p>\u0095 Gunta Stslzl: Bauhaus Master is at the RIBA Architecture Gallery, Portland Place, London W1 (020-7307 3770), until November 21.

      "bodyText": "In 1920, Walter Gropius circulated a memo to the professors at his year-old Bauhaus in Weimar, prescribing that women students be directed towards studies in weaving, pottery or bookbinding. Other options, such as metalwork and even painting, were seen as inappropriate. The pottery workshop bent over backwards not to take women. In 1922, the bookbinding workshop closed. That pretty much left weaving. Gunta St\u00f6lzl, who died in Switzerland in 1983, was one of the first students at the Bauhaus when it opened in 1919. She had already studied painting, ceramics and art history in Munich before the first world war, and she was no doubt attracted to the new school by its aims to break down the barriers between arts and crafts. It already had an impressive roster of teachers, too, such as Johannes Itten (the eccentric master colourist who dressed in monkish robes). St\u00f6lzl studied at the Bauhaus, then eventually taught there - until tittle-tattle about so-called \"improprieties\" forced her to resign in 1930. In 1927, she had taken over the running of the weaving workshop, an appointment that was hugely popular among her students, but by no means throughout the Bauhaus. She was the only woman to head a department; even so, she was paid less than the men and never became a professor. Now, after years in the shadows, her work - as one of the most talented and original textile designers and weavers of the 20th century - is finally being recognised. And realised. From her years at the Bauhaus, St\u00f6lzl left a number of impressive designs. Rug designers and makers Christopher Farr and Matthew Bourne have already produced a first collection of eight of these, which are currently on show at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Now, they are turning their attention to a second. Very few of St\u00f6lzl's designs were made during the Bauhaus years; most remained as deceptively simple watercolour sketches. Even in this form, they have an extraordinary vibrancy and life to them: a playfulness that reminds you of Paul Klee, combined with a virtuoso handling of colour and discipline of structure. \"Jack Lenor Larsen, the great American textiles man, suggested about five years ago that we produce St\u00f6lzl's designs,\" says Farr. \"Despite having been at art school myself, I hadn't heard of her at the time. It became clear when I spoke to her younger daughter, Monika Stadler, that Gunta was not a pushy type. She would have been pretty horrified at the way designers promote themselves today. The quest for fame would have been abhorrent to her. For her, the work was everything ... Part of what this project has taught me is how arbitrary art and design history is. It's just a matter of where the spotlight goes.\" Working closely with Stadler and her older sister, Yael Aloni, Farr started work. Despite having St\u00f6lzl's finished designs in front of him, the process was not straightforward. \"Watercolour has its own laws,\" he points out. \"Everything becomes different when you turn it into wool. So you find yourself making qualitative decisions all the way through.\" Stadler helped out with the choice of colours, negotiating her way through the variations in shade apparent in the original sketches. Other decisions had to be made: St\u00f6lzl had left no indication of an intended scale for the designs, for example, so again they had to work on instinct. \"This is probably the most challenging thing we've ever done,\" Farr says. \"As we got deeper into it, we realised how important St\u00f6lzl was to 20th-century design. She wasn't just a footnote. We felt a huge sense of responsibility to make something as inspiring as we had found the original designs.\" The obvious care and attention that Farr and his colleagues have lavished on getting the rugs just right is a fitting tribute to St\u00f6lzl. Had anyone taken the trouble to recognise it at the time, St\u00f6lzl was exactly the sort of artist that the Bauhaus had aimed to produce. She combined artistic brilliance with technical know-how, the latter mostly achieved, it would seem, from her own hard work and willingness to experiment on the looms, rather than from particularly thorough training. Her weaving workshop also successfully sold designs to industry, thus fulfilling another of Gropius's aims for the Bauhaus. When St\u00f6lzl became a teacher, she said that students should have \"a love for the material, imagination, a good feeling for colour, patience, perseverance, originality and flexibility of the mind as well of the hand\" - a fair summation of her own talents. \"You can tell she's got Klee and Kandinsky in her head,\" says Farr (both artists who taught at the Bauhaus). \"But, as a designer, I can see that she is honestly digesting an influence and coming out with something entirely her own\" \u0095 Gunta Stslzl: Bauhaus Master is at the RIBA Architecture Gallery, Portland Place, London W1 (020-7307 3770), until November 21.

      "body": "<p>The time has come to face up to it: my birthday is on the horizon. To tell the truth, I have little time for birthdays; I don't really like the formality that often accompanies the celebration meal. Instead, my favourite form of dining is the long lunch that drifts on into evening. Companionship and great victuals are the real point of such gatherings, and, in an ideal world, they would occur at random and frequently throughout the year.</p> <p>Mind you, when the boss told me that I could have anything at all for my birthday meal ... wow! Flights of fancy, such as caviar, Hollywood-style, came rushing to mind: as in Garbo as Anna Karenina, dipping into a great heap of ice-cooled sturgeon roe. \"What?\" I cried. \"Money no object?\" No, there's a cap of \u00a310 a head, came back the stern reply. Meanness itself. But perhaps it's better that way: the problem with such grandiose productions is that everything generally looks better on paper. Remember Babette's Feast?</p> <p>No, I would resist the dread words of \"theme\" and \"different\"; I'd just be myself, and cook a simple, elegant, robust meal, and hope for my favourite presents, a bottle of good fizz and an armload of cut flowers. Glad company, hearth and home would create the mise en sc\u00e8ne.</p> <p>So, what to begin with? A starter is a pivotal dish, critical in relaxing all into the meal, and therefore requires a great deal of consideration. While prepping in the restaurant, dwelling on this subject, in walked Mr Beale, a stout fellow with a twinkle in his eye and one of the ruddiest complexions I've ever seen. He was making his once-a-week delivery of the very best smoked eel, and it occurred to me that a dish of Beale's Eels' finest would do splendidly: sliced thinly, accompanied by crisp bacon, a really good poached egg and some horseradish to enliven the whole.</p> <p>Generally speaking, I prefer that a main course should be a dish of simplicity, with the principal ingredient - be that fish, meat, fowl or game - of the finest provenance, and cooked and accompanied in a manner that complements the raw material. That is, after all, the mark of all good cooking. The presentation should be without fuss or fanfare, letting the prime ingredient take its rightful place as the star of the meal.</p> <p>Well, it's a great theory, but what on earth was this dish fit for my birthday to be? It occurred to me that I rarely, if ever, eat veal these days. Sure, I have it on the menu at the restaurant, but its price is such (on account of the calves being hand-reared) that we can't afford to waste any of it, let alone allow any to slip off in the direction of the staff. So, veal is what I chose. The best veal dishes are Italian and, seeing as it is my birthday, a small taste of La Dolce Vita seems a perfectly reasonable request: cream sauces have been given a very bad press of late - of course, cream in every sauce in every meal is silly and lethal to a waistline and heart alike - but, every now and again, and cooked simply, a cream sauce is delicious. And when that sauce is charged with capers and anchovies and grappa et al and then spooned over a veal chop, it is very, very good indeed.</p> <p>I must confess to preferring no vegetables here, save for a few freshly gathered small potatoes, all waxy and delicious, and anointed with a little butter. In fact, I would prefer, instead, some really good cheese to have later on - a cracking good Cheddar or one of those dreamily creamy Irish cheeses, such as Durrus, with that patchy crust coloured varying hues of pink to beige, and the cheese itself all soft and yielding to the touch; or Cashel Blue, so rich and glorious.</p> <p>In the same manner as the devoted oenophile whose choice of wine will determine the choice of food, the ice cream I choose will determine the pudding to partner (in my book, ice cream is a must at any party). Coffee makes a great ice cream, one of the best in fact, yet it is all too rarely seen these days. Coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce is a very good combination; even better is coffee ice cream spooned into a chocolate souffl\u00e9 - a heavenly mix.</p> <p>The final, and most important, ingredient required to make this dinner special is the time to sit and enjoy the fruits of one's labours.</p> <p>All recipes serve six.</p> <p><b> Smoked eel salade - a wonderful composed salad. </b></p> <p>600g smoked eel fillet</p> <p>12 rashers very good streaky bacon</p> <p>18 small waxy potatoes</p> <p>1 tbsp red-wine vinegar</p> <p>4 tbsp top-quality olive oil</p> <p>1 tsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</p> <p>1 tsp caster sugar</p> <p>1 tsp white-wine vinegar</p> <p>3 tbsp double cream</p> <p>1 dssp grated fresh horseradish</p> <p>Salt and pepper</p> <p>6 fresh free-range eggs</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2.

      "bodyText": "The time has come to face up to it: my birthday is on the horizon. To tell the truth, I have little time for birthdays; I don't really like the formality that often accompanies the celebration meal. Instead, my favourite form of dining is the long lunch that drifts on into evening. Companionship and great victuals are the real point of such gatherings, and, in an ideal world, they would occur at random and frequently throughout the year. Mind you, when the boss told me that I could have anything at all for my birthday meal ... wow! Flights of fancy, such as caviar, Hollywood-style, came rushing to mind: as in Garbo as Anna Karenina, dipping into a great heap of ice-cooled sturgeon roe. \"What?\" I cried. \"Money no object?\" No, there's a cap of \u00a310 a head, came back the stern reply. Meanness itself. But perhaps it's better that way: the problem with such grandiose productions is that everything generally looks better on paper. Remember Babette's Feast? No, I would resist the dread words of \"theme\" and \"different\"; I'd just be myself, and cook a simple, elegant, robust meal, and hope for my favourite presents, a bottle of good fizz and an armload of cut flowers. Glad company, hearth and home would create the mise en sc\u00e8ne. So, what to begin with? A starter is a pivotal dish, critical in relaxing all into the meal, and therefore requires a great deal of consideration. While prepping in the restaurant, dwelling on this subject, in walked Mr Beale, a stout fellow with a twinkle in his eye and one of the ruddiest complexions I've ever seen. He was making his once-a-week delivery of the very best smoked eel, and it occurred to me that a dish of Beale's Eels' finest would do splendidly: sliced thinly, accompanied by crisp bacon, a really good poached egg and some horseradish to enliven the whole. Generally speaking, I prefer that a main course should be a dish of simplicity, with the principal ingredient - be that fish, meat, fowl or game - of the finest provenance, and cooked and accompanied in a manner that complements the raw material. That is, after all, the mark of all good cooking. The presentation should be without fuss or fanfare, letting the prime ingredient take its rightful place as the star of the meal. Well, it's a great theory, but what on earth was this dish fit for my birthday to be? It occurred to me that I rarely, if ever, eat veal these days. Sure, I have it on the menu at the restaurant, but its price is such (on account of the calves being hand-reared) that we can't afford to waste any of it, let alone allow any to slip off in the direction of the staff. So, veal is what I chose. The best veal dishes are Italian and, seeing as it is my birthday, a small taste of La Dolce Vita seems a perfectly reasonable request: cream sauces have been given a very bad press of late - of course, cream in every sauce in every meal is silly and lethal to a waistline and heart alike - but, every now and again, and cooked simply, a cream sauce is delicious. And when that sauce is charged with capers and anchovies and grappa et al and then spooned over a veal chop, it is very, very good indeed. I must confess to preferring no vegetables here, save for a few freshly gathered small potatoes, all waxy and delicious, and anointed with a little butter. In fact, I would prefer, instead, some really good cheese to have later on - a cracking good Cheddar or one of those dreamily creamy Irish cheeses, such as Durrus, with that patchy crust coloured varying hues of pink to beige, and the cheese itself all soft and yielding to the touch; or Cashel Blue, so rich and glorious. In the same manner as the devoted oenophile whose choice of wine will determine the choice of food, the ice cream I choose will determine the pudding to partner (in my book, ice cream is a must at any party). Coffee makes a great ice cream, one of the best in fact, yet it is all too rarely seen these days. Coffee ice cream with chocolate sauce is a very good combination; even better is coffee ice cream spooned into a chocolate souffl\u00e9 - a heavenly mix. The final, and most important, ingredient required to make this dinner special is the time to sit and enjoy the fruits of one's labours. All recipes serve six. Smoked eel salade - a wonderful composed salad. 600g smoked eel fillet 12 rashers very good streaky bacon 18 small waxy potatoes 1 tbsp red-wine vinegar 4 tbsp top-quality olive oil 1 tsp chopped flat-leaf parsley 1 tsp caster sugar 1 tsp white-wine vinegar 3 tbsp double cream 1 dssp grated fresh horseradish Salt and pepper 6 fresh free-range eggs Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Lay the rashers of bacon on a rack and cook them in the oven until crisp and well coloured. Scrub the potatoes clean, and boil them until cooked through. While they are still warm, peel the spuds and toss them in the red-wine vinegar, oil, salt and a little pepper. When they are cool, cut the potatoes into slices and toss with a little more oil and the parsley. Dissolve the caster sugar and a pinch of salt in the white-wine vinegar, then add the cream and horseradish (by all means up the quantity of horseradish if you like), and stir.

Veal chop with ham, anchovies, capers and grappa - a splendid dish that is both simple and unusual. Also, it is not without a hint of La Dolce Vita, so it's ideal celebration food. It is worth noting that British veal is dark and extremely delicious. 2 tbsp capers 6 good anchovy fillets 160g thickly sliced boiled ham 6 veal chops, around 2.5cms thick Vegetable oil, for frying Salt and pepper 60g unsalted butter 4 tbsp grappa 6 tbsp whipping cream If the capers are salted, rinse them and then chop roughly.

      "body": "<p>Three of us dined on six fat mackerel fillets for \u00a31.79 the other evening. I carefully filleted the fish with tweezers, sprinkled some paprika over them, flash-fried them on a griddle pan, and then served them with a mountain of spinach that had been cooked with olive oil and garlic, and two baguettes (which also vanished with the goat's cheese afterwards). The wine was the only expensive item of the whole meal: Casa Leona Chardonnay 1999, \u00a34.49, from Marks &amp; Spencer, but that's because I had bottles open for tasting purposes. </p> <p>Last week in this column, there was a \u00a32.99 Argentine white at the Co-Op that would have done splendid duty with those mackerel and the cheese, so I am prompted to observe that, by taking a little trouble, you can eat extremely well in this country and not spend a great deal of money. The Casa Leona, meanwhile, rates 16.5 points out of 20. It has a lovely texture, gentle and not overripe, and a whistle-clean, lemony finish. There is superb finesse here, combined with personality and subtle strength. And it gave my humble repast a slightly opulent edge that was totally at variance with the cost of the food ingredients. At the risk of sounding like a real curmudgeon, I should point out that I got the spinach, all two kilos of it, late in the afternoon in a street market for small change. </p> <p>M&amp;S also has three interesting French red wines for somewhat more than small change. Gold Label Reserve Barrel Aged Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99) has superbly meaty fruit, a touch of old cheroot to the spicy plums and blackberries, and a great rousing finish of oregano and coriander. This is a brilliant dinner party companion where mackerel are definitely not on the menu. Oily fish do not go with red wine, I find, unless you stuff them with herbs and roasted pine nuts, and have a green sauce handy. Abbaye de Tholomies Minervois 1996 (16.5 points, \u00a35.99) shows great texture like ruffled velvet with patches of raw denim. There is a perfect balance of alcohol and tannins, and of fruit and acidity here, so we have a minor masterpiece of rustic richness and unpretentious gluggability. Chteau Planeze Ctes du Roussillon Villages 1998 (16.5 points, \u00a36.99) is an all-action red with depth and daring. The spicy plum and peppery richness of the fruit is jammy but never too cloying, and the finish is complex, concentrated and very classy. </p> <p>Oddbins has also had an influx of interesting reds recently. Segada Tinto Ribatejano 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.49), from Portugal, is a deliciously different wine, presenting as it does a sensual texture, spicy plum/blackcurrant fruit and very deep tannins. San Crispino Primitivo del Salento 1999 (16 points, \u00a34.99), from Italy, meanwhile, has striking richness and ripe fruit of some heftiness. Engaging, elastic, exhilarating, this wine offers the palate a whirlwind ride of flavours. Cosme Palacio y Hermanos Rioja 1997 (16 points, \u00a36.99) is in consistent form with this vintage - it is always one of the more elegantly compact riojas - and the 97 has polish, dash and a slightly courtly, old-fashioned, well-mannered finish. </p> <p>Oddbins is also where the rugged South African Saxenberg Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (17 points, \u00a38.49) resides. This is a quite stunning wine, with a bewilderingly delicious array of extras to the conventional blackcurrants, bellpepper fruit and smoky tannins - these include raisins, figs, spicy cherries, liquorice and herbs. Well, you pay more, you expect more. </p> <p>That's my understanding of value for money, at any rate. But it is palpably not the Co-Op's. This retailer's philosophy is the exact opposite: you pay less and you get even more value for money. This does not happen with all wines, for sure, but Elsa Barbera 1999, a charming red wine from Argentina that normally costs \u00a33.99 has been reduced to \u00a32.99 until October 18. This is not so much value for money as value for peanuts, for this wine sits on the tastebuds like a plumped-up cushion and is full of warm, subtly spicy fruit. As such, it is well worth 15.5 points.</p>",

A jolly spring in your step won't do, unless it looks like you're about to run up and slam dunk a basketball. For hard men, it is vital that you walk with your arms slightly out from your body, as if you had huge muscles under your armpits. Similarly, you must walk with your legs slightly apart, as if you were transporting genitalia of rhinocerine proportions. (It's impossible to be hard and pigeon-toed.) Hard cars need to have fat tyres and a big exhaust pipe. For the chronically hard, shaded windows are a must, so no one else can look at them - for all we know, they're sitting inside wearing a pink fluffy cardigan, but it's probably not worth checking. </p> <p>Conversational pyrotechnics are not at a premium for the truly hard. All you really need is a variation on, 'What is it at which you are looking?' followed by a punchline that can, obviously, be a punch or, if you don't want to have to let go of your grip on your lager/dog/bird, a head-butt. </p> <p>Fighting is a very important part of being hard. Distressingly, for men who aspire to hardness, fighting can actually hurt quite a lot and not necessarily go your way. So, on balance, it's much better to talk loudly about it. This means that you can accidentally brush against someone in the shops and then turn it into an epic street scrap when you're talking to your mates. </p> <p>You would have thought that really hard men would want to find a really hard woman to go out with. Far from it. They usually go for something really soft and fluffy to emphasise their own hardness. It's their way of saying they've outsourced their feminine side. </p> <p>Tattoos are a great short-cut to hardness, unless you have it done on your stag night and come out with 'Derek Is My Darling' on your right bicep. Having 'I Love Mum' is perfectly acceptable for the clinically hard, and does not imply in any way that your are a mother's boy. Again, this is not worth checking, especially if the tattoo is on the face. Muscles and weapons are the currency of hardness, and generally you have one or the other. Small men with no muscles have very sharp, pointy knives, which they like to exhibit at regular intervals. Bigger men like to accumulate muscles and then exhibit them in tight-fitting T-shirts. </p> <p>Remember that this is a private exhibition, and not one to which you're invited, otherwise you may be asked what it is at which you are looking.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the Westbeth studio in Greenwich Village, a vast, iron-beamed space with radiant views of New York city streaming in through every window, the Merce Cunningham Company is warming up for the day's rehearsals. Wearing threadbare tights and woolly leg-warmers, the dancers put their limber bodies through the usual paces, slowly stretching in great, arching steps that seem to consume an acre of floor-space, shaking out their joints in splashes of muscle and grace. </p> <p>It takes a little while to notice, tucked away in one corner behind a raised platform, the old man sitting at his table, \"dreaming up steps\". Looking up nervously now and then, he scribbles away in a note-pad, twisting tiny stick-figures into odd, off-kilter shapes, right until the moment when the rehearsal is scheduled to begin. Then he puts the paper to one side and raises himself from the chair, a tortuous process that seems to take over a minute. </p> <p>Only when he takes his first, halting steps is it possible to see the full harrowing extent of his infirmity: one leg delicate, a little bowed, the other collapsed, crumpled like a parody of one of his contorted line drawings. With great effort, he drags himself over to a barre that runs the length of the room and, his buckled feet scraping the floor, uses it to pull himself along. Only when he has neared the end of his agonising journey, do the lithe, young bodies cease their exercises and stand to attention. </p> <p>\"What a beautiful morning,\" he announces, in a shaking, barely audible voice. \"It was this kind of day - bright and sunny and clear - when I landed in New York for the first time and I thought: 'Oh boy, this is it'. Great things could happen here.\" He then pauses, surveys the dancers for a moment and smiles: \"All right then, let's begin...\" </p> <p>Merce Cunningham is, without doubt, the world's greatest living choreographer. His name stands alongside Martha Graham and George Balanchine in the pantheon of mercurial figures that transformed 20th century dance, though his work arguably reaches further and deeper, celebrating sheer movement for its own stark, austere sake. \"He's just continued to astound people and stay outside of any fashion or polemic,\" says fellow choreographer Bill T Jones, \"Merce is the champion of the struggle to say that dance is it's own primary language.\" </p> <p>At the height of his powers, Cunningham was also a peerless performer. His ability to launch himself into the air was legendary, often drawing gasps from the audience, most famously in the celebrated scene in Martha Graham's Letter To The World in 1940 when, to the cue of Graham's \"Dear March, come in,\" the young Cunningham, in top hat and tails, would bound across the stage. However, it was through his own, eccentric choreography that his feral radiance really shone: \"He never moved like anybody else in the company,\" says Marianne Simon, a Cunningham troupe member, \"he looked not like a man, but like a gazelle or a lily blooming in the field.\" </p> <p>His genius was like a force of nature, sending unlikely jolting, shuddering ripples through his arms and pelvis and legs. Some say, \"he was an animal\". And it's easy to see why, in pieces such as the startling 1960 work Crises, with its darting, shifting solo, outstretched one moment, spastic and convulsive the next or in the finale of Place, where Cunningham gave one of his most disturbing performances, thrashing around wildly inside a transparent plastic sack. </p> <p>Even at the end of his career - he performed later than anyone bar Graham herself - just a flicker of his boney hands could radiate a tremendous energy: \"I remember watching a new solo of his, and he is crawling around the floor and doing all kinds of crazy things,\" says Remy Charlip, who danced with the Cunningham company for its first 11 years, \"and it was like looking into his psyche. I thought he was having a fit and I remember saying: \"He's not going to do that on stage, is he? He can't do that in public?\" </p> <p>This same naturally iconoclastic spirit also shaped the radical approach of this choreography. With his partner and mentor, the composer John Cage, Cunningham dreamt up some of the most radical and sometimes downright perverse performance notions of the 20th century: flipping coins or throwing dice to decide the structure of pieces; wilfully destroying the time-honoured bond between dance and music. </p> <p>In the field of modern dance, these ideas would eventually influence Twyla Tharp, Richard Alston and Siobhan Davies. Cunningham would also have an enormous impact on other creative fields, on experimental theatre practitioners such as Robert Wilson and choreographer/director Meredith Monk. It is no surprise that one of theatre's greatest innovators is numbered among his earliest supporters: \"Cunningham's group is in the tradition of Martha Graham in many ways, but in one most of all,\" wrote Peter Brook in 1964. \"The very things that are criticised, laughed at and ignored, will only a few months later be imitated everywhere.\" </p> <p>By all accounts, Cunningham has mellowed considerably. With his halo of untidy white curls, he now comes across as a delightfully charming, easy-mannered, quaintly old-fashioned elderly gentleman, who repeats his well-worn anecdotes with the confidence of someone who knows his word is now creed. The debilitating arthritis and chronic hip condition that finally forced him off the stage in his early 70s gives his body a brittle, almost translucent quality. However, he transcends his frailty with an open smile and a decidedly unpretentious wit. </p> <p>But as long-time members and associates of the company will openly testify, this wasn't always the case. Right up until the death in 1992 of his partner John Cage, who had run much of company life, organised tours, even mediated in disputes with dancers, Cunningham was often an aloof, cold, difficult and demanding presence: \"He would have these sort of black moods when you couldn't get through to him at all,\" remembers David Vaughan, original company manager and now company archivist. \"When I started to work with him, on some days I would feel it was like walking into this completely impenetrable wall around him. We all felt that.\" Some have even gone so far as to assert that the same caprice and obsessiveness that made the work great also led him to take dangerous risks, both with himself and with his dancers: \"Of course, he crippled himself by doing some of these wild things,\" says one company member. \"He did a dance where people were like twisting and torqueing and spiralling their bodies. The company used to call it 'whiplash'.\" </p> <p>Cunningham is also protective of his personal life, and his relationship with Cage still remains one of the great enigmas of the avant-garde. The blank canvas meticulously maintained by both has allowed detractors to paint a picture of the loquacious Cage as \"Svengali\", feeding ideas and theories to his younger, more taciturn prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And while neither denied the fact of his romantic attachment, it had remained until now unfurnished with even the most rudimentary details: \"I do the cooking,\" Cage commented wryly, when pressed once by a gay activist for a few morsels of information, \"and Merce does the dishes.\" Little more than this has ever been divulged before, either in Cage's biography or in the voluminous press coverage of Cunningham. </p> <p>However, it would appear that there was considerably more to their union, which seems to have been marked by affairs with male dancers in the company. At least once they shared the affections of the same young dancer. It is possibly the fundamentally fraught and complex nature of their 50-year relationship - and not, as is often cited, lingering fear from the beginning of their time together, when homosexuality was still an offence punishable by law -that continues to fuel Cunningham's silence in this relatively open-minded era: \"I don't think I was guarded about my personal life,\" he says gently, \"It is quite true I didn't speak about it very much but I didn't see any reason to speak about it. John and I were together. We did our work together. We travelled together. What more is there to say?\" </p> <p>Mercier Philip Cunningham was born in the small lumber town of Centralia, Washington on April 16 1919, the third son of Clifford Cunningham, a lawyer of Irish descent, and Mayme Joach, a teacher. From a young age, Mercier displayed a gregarious streak that marked him out, as he lightheartedly puts it, as the \"criminal\" among a family of lawyers: \"He liked the beach and beach business - the sand and all kind of captured his attention, whirling around in it,\" says his older brother Dorwin, a retired lawyer who still lives in Washington State. \"And if the circus came to town, when they would be going through the streets, I remember Merce would get up and do sort of a dance, just as a youngster would.\" </p> <p>At 12 he began studying tap-dancing with a former vaudeville and circus performer named Mrs Barrett, who ran an improvised local academy. After he left high school, Mercier made a half-hearted attempt to study at the George Washington University in Washington DC, taking literature and theatre history courses. Dorwin, who was studying law in DC, kept a journal of this time: \"We ate out and Swords [their flatmate] complained about the expenses,\" he reads falteringly from the entry for October 11 1936. \"Then Mercier arrives, bubbling over with enthusiasm after seeing the Jooss ballet in the National Theatre. Such interest as his must be the first outward signs of latent genius.\" </p> <p>However, Mercier only lasted one semester at university, enrolling instead at the Cornish School for Performing and Visual Arts in Seattle, an astonishing stroke of good fortune that would transform his life. First he got himself into the 8am dance class of Bonnie Bird, an ex-Martha Graham dancer, who would prove a formative influence. Then, during his second year there, a 27-year-old composer named John Cage was employed as rehearsal pianist, relocating from California with his wife Xenia Kashevaroff. Cage had studied composition under Schoenberg and already had something of a radical, iconoclastic outlook: \"He started a percussion programme,\" says Cunningham, \"and once I had mastered the piece, he came and said 'You were playing everything absolutely perfectly. Now just go a little further and make a few mistakes.' I thought 'that is a marvellous idea'.\" </p> <p>At the end of his second year at Cornish, in the summer of '39, Cunningham hitch-hiked to Mills College in California where the Bennington School of the Dance was holding its summer school, with tutorials run by famous figures such as Charles Weidman, Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. \"I didn't know anything about her [Graham]; I had never seen her dance,\" Cunningham admits, \"I think that she conducted the last two weeks and I remember this woman who was really small, compared to myself. But such a force.\" </p> <p> Young Mercier also made an instant impression on Graham, who offered him a place in her company if he came to New York. He immediately travelled back to Centralia to break the news to his parents: \"My mother's face fell. But my father, who was a very bright intelligent man, he looked at me and he looked at her and then he said: 'Oh, let him go. He's going to go anyway.' And so I went.\" After three days on a train, Cunningham arrived in New York on a sunny late-summer day in 1939: \"I stepped onto the pavement and I said 'This is home'. It was immediate.\" He then made his way to the the Martha Graham Studio: \"Before classes began, I walked in the door. She was standing there and she said: 'Oh! I didn't think you'd come.' I didn't say it but I thought to myself: 'Lady, you don't know me'.\" </p> <p>That season Graham was beginning work on her landmark work Every Soul Is A Circus, and she cast Cunningham in one of the lead male roles: \"I thought that was wonderful. I get to be dancing. It wasn't until the performances I suddenly thought: 'Oh, I 'm performing on Broadway in New York.' It was really quite a remarkable feeling.\" </p> <p>As Graham company member, Nina Fonaroff - now 86 - recalls: \"As a person he was enticing. He was a Puck - irresistible, and very funny too. And as a dancer he was a phenomenon, absolutely extraor dinary. And he had such passion for it. I remember in Circus, when he made his debut, he had on these pink tights and a pink top, and his heart was beating so hard you could practically see it thumping with excitement.\" </p> <p>Cunningham, who by now had shortened his first name to Merce, went on to dance lead roles in El Penitente (where he played Christ) and Letter To The World, a piece based on Emily Dickinson's poetry. Graham's relatively narrative-based approach couldn't contain or satisfy Cunningham, who by the end of this time with the company, was already choreographing his own pieces: \"I remember one day he came bouncing up saying, 'I have a dance, I have a dance. Come see, come see'.\" says Fonaroff. \"And so I followed him into the studio and he did this thing, almost walking on his knees and jumping up and down. It was called Totem Ancestor. I'd never seen anything like it.\" </p> <p>The real catalyst for Cunning ham's break with the Graham company was the arrival of John Cage who had moved to New York with his wife Xenia in the summer of 1942. Cage wrote the music for their first solo programme in 1944, which included Totem Ancestor, a solo called Root Of An Unfocus, and Tossed As It Is Untroubled, inspired by Joyce's Finnegans Wake: \"I date my beginning from this concert\", Cunningham says. </p> <p>During rehearsals, Cage and Cunningham also formulated one of their most fundamental tenets: the separation of music and dance. \"We could agree on a common structure for a particular dance and John could compose to that structure and I could choreograph. In the beginning, there were points in that structure where the music and dance came together. But later we abandoned that and made them entirely independent.\" By the early 50s, at the instigation of Cage, Cunningham began to use \"chance operations\" to formulate the ele ments of his pieces, particularly in the key 1952 piece Suite By Chance: \"The individual sequences, and the length of time, and the directions in space were discovered by tossing coins,\" he says. </p> <p>Many of these ideas were tested and developed not only through Cunningham's occasional performances but also through the famous summer sessions at the celebrated Black Mountain College, North Carolina, where in 1952 Cunningham and Cage masterminded the world's first \"Happening\". That summer in Black Mountain also saw the birth of \"Merce Cunningham and Dance Company\", a startling ensemble of dancers such as Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, Jo-Anne Melsher and Remy Charlip which, over the next few years, would give form to some of Cunningham's ground- breaking works: 1953's Septet, where a still, balletic style is positioned next to the music of Eric Satie, and Minutiae in 1954, which marks the beginning of Robert Rauschenberg's 10-year stint as resident designer. </p> <p>However, it is not just for the quality of the work that the dancers still nostalgically refer to this early period as the Golden Age, but also because of the distinctive company spirit, forged by communal hardships. Reviews were almost universally negative: \"His dance language is for the initiated few who are as interested in contemplating Mr Cunningham's navel as he is himself,\" Dance Magazine said in 1953. \"Have a little Mercy, Merce,\" a later headline would proclaim. </p> <p>But diatribes did little more than steel a curiously robust sense of mission, as the company toured their pieces in a clapped-out Volkswagen bus, often driving inordinate distances for a single performance and playing to meagre audiences: \"It took exactly nine people and a ton of luggage,\" remembers dancer Carolyn Brown. \"We sometimes drove all day and into the wee hours. I remember giving a performance without sleeping at all. But it really was a lot of fun. </p> <p>\"John was a wonderful leader. He and [composer] David Tudor would get into these wonderful conversations. Meanwhile, Merce would be very quiet and study Russian and read or knit. The rest of us would play games. It just was a great time to develop a real company because we were so close together.\" </p> <p>By this time, the relationship between Cunningham and Cage was deeply personal as well as inextricably professional. Prior to this involvement, Cunningham appears to have conducted predominantly heterosexual relationships, both during his time with the Martha Graham company - when he was deeply attached to a Bennington theatre student - and earlier at the Cornish school, when he went out with a dance student named Joyce Holder. </p> <p>\"We were very close but it was always ambiguous,\" Holder recalls. \"I was a little wild and was having many flings. I think that one of the attractions for Merce was that my other boyfriends could take him around in their cars if he needed to go someplace.\" Then, when Holder followed him to New York, she witnessed the formation of the Cage/Cunningham bond in 1942: \"Merce would always hint to me that it was very valuable for his work. Music parts drove him crazy and John composing for him solved that problem. His implication to me always was that their relationship was mutually advantageous on that level.\" </p> <p>Equally indistinct was the nature of the union itself, which remained clandestine for decades: \"I didn't have any inkling,\" says Marianne Simon, who left the company in 1958, \"and I don't think I was alone in that among the female dancers. We were all madly in love with [Merce] in those early days.\" </p> <p> From an early stage, however, there were affairs with young male dancers in the company: \"It was and it wasn't [an open relationship],\" says one of early dancers, who was close to both men, \"it was kind of secretive and at the same time they both slept with other people. Later on, Merce took up with a younger dancer in the company who did not want John to come on tour any more, and that was crushing to John because he built that company. John got all the dates and wrote all of the letters anddrove and cooked and made all the arrangements.\" </p> <p>At times it seems to have been precisely this dominance that Cunningham was struggling against, both in his affairs and in his general behaviour: \"John was the brains and Merce was the body,\" continues the same troupe member. \"Merce couldn't really protect himself, so he would do things like hide in a room for a week and wouldn't come out and wouldn't eat. John would get frantic. That was his way of dealing with John.\" </p> <p>Yet, if Cunningham really did worry that his work would never be fully appreciated and would always remain in Cage's shadow, grounds for at least some of his fears would evaporate in the pivotal year of 1964. Tiring of New York's indifference, the company decided to tour Europe and Asia to showcase some of their strongest work: Winterbranch, a relentless piece based on the theme of falling, featuring La Monte Young's stereophonic buzzsaw soundtrack; Story, which involved scrap remade by Rauschenberg from whatever junk was lying around the theatre; and Crises, in which the dancers were bound by giant elastic bands. </p> <p>At the first major stopover, Paris, they met a familiar reaction: \"People threw things at us,\" Carolyn Brown recalls, \"eggs and tomatoes. During the interval they went out to get more.\" During the Venice dates, things began to pick up; the press reception was respectful and Rauschenberg picked up first prize at the Bienniale art show. However, by the time they reached London, the Merce Cunningham company was being hailed as a sensation: \"At a blow, ballet has been brought right up in line with the front-rank experiments in the other arts,\" raved Alexander Bland in the Observer, \"something which has hardly happened since the days of Diaghilev. Here is heart-warming proof that it is an art with a future, opening up ranges of possibilities which stretch out of sight.\" </p> <p>After an initial scintillating run at Sadler's Wells, attended by everyone from Frederick Ashton to Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, they transferred for an equally triumphant three-week run at the Phoenix: \"Merce was really quite astonished. In New York, the most he'd ever played was two nights,\" recalls Michael White, who produced the London leg of the tour. </p> <p>The tour proceeded in a rather chaotic fashion through Scandinavia, onward to Prague (where the posters trumpeted dances \"in the style of West Side Story\") and Poland, and then further east to Bombay. By the time they reached Japan, the strain was beginning to tell, with tensions particularly clamorous between Cage and Cunningham on the one hand and on the other between them and Rauschenberg, who had made the mistake of becoming far too famous in the wake of his Venice conquest. </p> <p>After the general critical success of the tour, and particularly the rapture of the London reviewers, subsequently reported in the US press, the entire character of the company changed. While the controversy, the sporadic booing and walkouts, and the financial crises would continue for some decades yet, the critical climate became infinitely more favourable, the company grew in size and professionalism, and Cunningham him self began a steady upward trajectory towards avant garde canonisation. </p> <p>The latter half of the 60s saw further Cunningham highlights, notably 1968's Walkaround Time, which employed sets based on Marcel Duchamp's Large Glass, and the stunning piece Rainforest, also in the same year, strewn with Andy Warhol's helium-filled pillows. In the 70s and early 80s, alongside the video artist Charles Atlas, Cunningham coopted video techniques in pieces such as 1975's Blue Studio: Five Segments, and Channel/Inserts in 1981. </p> <p>By the early 90s Cunningham's physical condition was beginning to severely restrict how much he could perform or even demonstrate to the dancers, and he turned to computer technology, devising ever more ingeniously abstract and random steps using a computer program called LifeForms. Still on the cutting edge at the age of 81, he has taken this a step forward in a work called Biped, which uses state of the art Motion Capture technology to record the movements of his dancers and reproduce them as computer animations within the dance. As audiences at London's Barbican will discover next week, the piece, featuring the music of Gavin Bryars, is mesmerising, the ultimate combination of art and technology. </p> <p>The main event during this latest period of Cunningham's work and life was, of course, the death of Cage in August 1992. After returning from the New York studio to their Sixth Avenue apartment, Cunningham discovered him collapsed on the kitchen floor, having suffered a stroke. Despite the many difficulties in their relationship, the two men had been, according to Cage's assistant Laura Kuhn, \"very affectionate\" in their final years together, openly so perhaps for the first time, now that neither had anything left to prove. </p> <p>The loss of Cage would shatter a dynamic established over half a century: \"Because John answered the questions so brilliantly, I kept my mouth shut. But suddenly he was not around to do it. And so I was forced to speak.\" Most tellingly, however, Cunningham was back in the studio the day after Cage's death: \"I decided quite quickly: 'Well, John is dead, there is nothing I can do about that, and I'm just going to go on.' I thought about it. I would find my own solution.\" </p> <p>That solution was of course, the work - the force that had sustained and nourished their relationship, made sense of the affairs and the infidelities, smoothed over the petty jealousies. Cunningham's obsession with his work was also the force that drove him, perhaps, to take risks with his body, to continue performing long after it was wise, to demand - and often get - the impossible from his dancers, to push his choreography beyond the bounds of what was thought possible. </p> <p>\"You have to love dancing to stick to it,\" he has written, \"It gives nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive. It is not for unsteady souls.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Mercier Philip Cunningham </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> April 16 1919<strong> </strong> Centralia, Washington, USA. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> Centralia High School; Cornish School of the Arts,Seattle, 1937-39. </p> <p><strong> Early career: </strong> Soloist, Martha Graham company, 1939 to 1945; leading roles in Every Soul Is A Circus, 1939, El Penitente, 1940, and Letter To The World, 1940. </p> <p><strong> Works include: </strong> Suite By Chance 1952; Symphonie Pour Un Homme Seul 1952; Septet 1953; Minutiae 1954; Antic Meet 1958; Summerspace1958; Crises 1960; Field Dances 1963; Story 1963; Winterbranch 1964; Variations V 1964; Rainforest 1968; Walkaround Time 1968; Canfield 1969; Changing Steps 1973; Blue Studio: Five Segments 1975; Torse 1976; Channel/Inserts 1981; Quartet 1982; Enter 1992; Ocean 1994; Biped 2000. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> Guggenheim Fellowship for choreography 1954 and 1959; Laurence Olivier award for best new dance production1985; inducted into National Museum of Dance Hall of Fame, Saratoga, 1993; Golden Lion, Venice Biennale 1995; Lilian Gish award 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 The Merce Cunningham Dance Company is at the Barbican Arts Centre, London EC2, from October 10-14 at 7.45pm.

      "bodyText": "In the Westbeth studio in Greenwich Village, a vast, iron-beamed space with radiant views of New York city streaming in through every window, the Merce Cunningham Company is warming up for the day's rehearsals. Wearing threadbare tights and woolly leg-warmers, the dancers put their limber bodies through the usual paces, slowly stretching in great, arching steps that seem to consume an acre of floor-space, shaking out their joints in splashes of muscle and grace. It takes a little while to notice, tucked away in one corner behind a raised platform, the old man sitting at his table, \"dreaming up steps\". Looking up nervously now and then, he scribbles away in a note-pad, twisting tiny stick-figures into odd, off-kilter shapes, right until the moment when the rehearsal is scheduled to begin. Then he puts the paper to one side and raises himself from the chair, a tortuous process that seems to take over a minute. Only when he takes his first, halting steps is it possible to see the full harrowing extent of his infirmity: one leg delicate, a little bowed, the other collapsed, crumpled like a parody of one of his contorted line drawings. With great effort, he drags himself over to a barre that runs the length of the room and, his buckled feet scraping the floor, uses it to pull himself along. Only when he has neared the end of his agonising journey, do the lithe, young bodies cease their exercises and stand to attention. \"What a beautiful morning,\" he announces, in a shaking, barely audible voice. \"It was this kind of day - bright and sunny and clear - when I landed in New York for the first time and I thought: 'Oh boy, this is it'. Great things could happen here.\" He then pauses, surveys the dancers for a moment and smiles: \"All right then, let's begin...\" Merce Cunningham is, without doubt, the world's greatest living choreographer. His name stands alongside Martha Graham and George Balanchine in the pantheon of mercurial figures that transformed 20th century dance, though his work arguably reaches further and deeper, celebrating sheer movement for its own stark, austere sake. \"He's just continued to astound people and stay outside of any fashion or polemic,\" says fellow choreographer Bill T Jones, \"Merce is the champion of the struggle to say that dance is it's own primary language.\" At the height of his powers, Cunningham was also a peerless performer. His ability to launch himself into the air was legendary, often drawing gasps from the audience, most famously in the celebrated scene in Martha Graham's Letter To The World in 1940 when, to the cue of Graham's \"Dear March, come in,\" the young Cunningham, in top hat and tails, would bound across the stage. However, it was through his own, eccentric choreography that his feral radiance really shone: \"He never moved like anybody else in the company,\" says Marianne Simon, a Cunningham troupe member, \"he looked not like a man, but like a gazelle or a lily blooming in the field.\" His genius was like a force of nature, sending unlikely jolting, shuddering ripples through his arms and pelvis and legs. Some say, \"he was an animal\". And it's easy to see why, in pieces such as the startling 1960 work Crises, with its darting, shifting solo, outstretched one moment, spastic and convulsive the next or in the finale of Place, where Cunningham gave one of his most disturbing performances, thrashing around wildly inside a transparent plastic sack. Even at the end of his career - he performed later than anyone bar Graham herself - just a flicker of his boney hands could radiate a tremendous energy: \"I remember watching a new solo of his, and he is crawling around the floor and doing all kinds of crazy things,\" says Remy Charlip, who danced with the Cunningham company for its first 11 years, \"and it was like looking into his psyche. I thought he was having a fit and I remember saying: \"He's not going to do that on stage, is he? He can't do that in public?\" This same naturally iconoclastic spirit also shaped the radical approach of this choreography. With his partner and mentor, the composer John Cage, Cunningham dreamt up some of the most radical and sometimes downright perverse performance notions of the 20th century: flipping coins or throwing dice to decide the structure of pieces; wilfully destroying the time-honoured bond between dance and music. In the field of modern dance, these ideas would eventually influence Twyla Tharp, Richard Alston and Siobhan Davies. Cunningham would also have an enormous impact on other creative fields, on experimental theatre practitioners such as Robert Wilson and choreographer/director Meredith Monk. It is no surprise that one of theatre's greatest innovators is numbered among his earliest supporters: \"Cunningham's group is in the tradition of Martha Graham in many ways, but in one most of all,\" wrote Peter Brook in 1964. \"The very things that are criticised, laughed at and ignored, will only a few months later be imitated everywhere.\" By all accounts, Cunningham has mellowed considerably. With his halo of untidy white curls, he now comes across as a delightfully charming, easy-mannered, quaintly old-fashioned elderly gentleman, who repeats his well-worn anecdotes with the confidence of someone who knows his word is now creed. The debilitating arthritis and chronic hip condition that finally forced him off the stage in his early 70s gives his body a brittle, almost translucent quality. However, he transcends his frailty with an open smile and a decidedly unpretentious wit. But as long-time members and associates of the company will openly testify, this wasn't always the case. Right up until the death in 1992 of his partner John Cage, who had run much of company life, organised tours, even mediated in disputes with dancers, Cunningham was often an aloof, cold, difficult and demanding presence: \"He would have these sort of black moods when you couldn't get through to him at all,\" remembers David Vaughan, original company manager and now company archivist. \"When I started to work with him, on some days I would feel it was like walking into this completely impenetrable wall around him. We all felt that.\" Some have even gone so far as to assert that the same caprice and obsessiveness that made the work great also led him to take dangerous risks, both with himself and with his dancers: \"Of course, he crippled himself by doing some of these wild things,\" says one company member. \"He did a dance where people were like twisting and torqueing and spiralling their bodies. The company used to call it 'whiplash'.\" Cunningham is also protective of his personal life, and his relationship with Cage still remains one of the great enigmas of the avant-garde. The blank canvas meticulously maintained by both has allowed detractors to paint a picture of the loquacious Cage as \"Svengali\", feeding ideas and theories to his younger, more taciturn prot\u00e9g\u00e9. And while neither denied the fact of his romantic attachment, it had remained until now unfurnished with even the most rudimentary details: \"I do the cooking,\" Cage commented wryly, when pressed once by a gay activist for a few morsels of information, \"and Merce does the dishes.\" Little more than this has ever been divulged before, either in Cage's biography or in the voluminous press coverage of Cunningham. However, it would appear that there was considerably more to their union, which seems to have been marked by affairs with male dancers in the company. At least once they shared the affections of the same young dancer. It is possibly the fundamentally fraught and complex nature of their 50-year relationship - and not, as is often cited, lingering fear from the beginning of their time together, when homosexuality was still an offence punishable by law -that continues to fuel Cunningham's silence in this relatively open-minded era: \"I don't think I was guarded about my personal life,\" he says gently, \"It is quite true I didn't speak about it very much but I didn't see any reason to speak about it. John and I were together. We did our work together. We travelled together. What more is there to say?\" Mercier Philip Cunningham was born in the small lumber town of Centralia, Washington on April 16 1919, the third son of Clifford Cunningham, a lawyer of Irish descent, and Mayme Joach, a teacher. From a young age, Mercier displayed a gregarious streak that marked him out, as he lightheartedly puts it, as the \"criminal\" among a family of lawyers: \"He liked the beach and beach business - the sand and all kind of captured his attention, whirling around in it,\" says his older brother Dorwin, a retired lawyer who still lives in Washington State. \"And if the circus came to town, when they would be going through the streets, I remember Merce would get up and do sort of a dance, just as a youngster would.\" At 12 he began studying tap-dancing with a former vaudeville and circus performer named Mrs Barrett, who ran an improvised local academy. After he left high school, Mercier made a half-hearted attempt to study at the George Washington University in Washington DC, taking literature and theatre history courses. Dorwin, who was studying law in DC, kept a journal of this time: \"We ate out and Swords [their flatmate] complained about the expenses,\" he reads falteringly from the entry for October 11 1936. \"Then Mercier arrives, bubbling over with enthusiasm after seeing the Jooss ballet in the National Theatre. Such interest as his must be the first outward signs of latent genius.\" However, Mercier only lasted one semester at university, enrolling instead at the Cornish School for Performing and Visual Arts in Seattle, an astonishing stroke of good fortune that would transform his life. First he got himself into the 8am dance class of Bonnie Bird, an ex-Martha Graham dancer, who would prove a formative influence. Then, during his second year there, a 27-year-old composer named John Cage was employed as rehearsal pianist, relocating from California with his wife Xenia Kashevaroff. Cage had studied composition under Schoenberg and already had something of a radical, iconoclastic outlook: \"He started a percussion programme,\" says Cunningham, \"and once I had mastered the piece, he came and said 'You were playing everything absolutely perfectly. Now just go a little further and make a few mistakes.' I thought 'that is a marvellous idea'.\" At the end of his second year at Cornish, in the summer of '39, Cunningham hitch-hiked to Mills College in California where the Bennington School of the Dance was holding its summer school, with tutorials run by famous figures such as Charles Weidman, Hanya Holm and Martha Graham. \"I didn't know anything about her [Graham]; I had never seen her dance,\" Cunningham admits, \"I think that she conducted the last two weeks and I remember this woman who was really small, compared to myself. But such a force.\" Young Mercier also made an instant impression on Graham, who offered him a place in her company if he came to New York. He immediately travelled back to Centralia to break the news to his parents: \"My mother's face fell. But my father, who was a very bright intelligent man, he looked at me and he looked at her and then he said: 'Oh, let him go. He's going to go anyway.' And so I went.\" After three days on a train, Cunningham arrived in New York on a sunny late-summer day in 1939: \"I stepped onto the pavement and I said 'This is home'. It was immediate.\" He then made his way to the the Martha Graham Studio: \"Before classes began, I walked in the door. She was standing there and she said: 'Oh! I didn't think you'd come.' I didn't say it but I thought to myself: 'Lady, you don't know me'.\" That season Graham was beginning work on her landmark work Every Soul Is A Circus, and she cast Cunningham in one of the lead male roles: \"I thought that was wonderful. I get to be dancing. It wasn't until the performances I suddenly thought: 'Oh, I 'm performing on Broadway in New York.' It was really quite a remarkable feeling.\" As Graham company member, Nina Fonaroff - now 86 - recalls: \"As a person he was enticing. He was a Puck - irresistible, and very funny too. And as a dancer he was a phenomenon, absolutely extraor dinary. And he had such passion for it. I remember in Circus, when he made his debut, he had on these pink tights and a pink top, and his heart was beating so hard you could practically see it thumping with excitement.\" Cunningham, who by now had shortened his first name to Merce, went on to dance lead roles in El Penitente (where he played Christ) and Letter To The World, a piece based on Emily Dickinson's poetry. Graham's relatively narrative-based approach couldn't contain or satisfy Cunningham, who by the end of this time with the company, was already choreographing his own pieces: \"I remember one day he came bouncing up saying, 'I have a dance, I have a dance. Come see, come see'.\" says Fonaroff. \"And so I followed him into the studio and he did this thing, almost walking on his knees and jumping up and down. It was called Totem Ancestor. I'd never seen anything like it.\" The real catalyst for Cunning ham's break with the Graham company was the arrival of John Cage who had moved to New York with his wife Xenia in the summer of 1942. Cage wrote the music for their first solo programme in 1944, which included Totem Ancestor, a solo called Root Of An Unfocus, and Tossed As It Is Untroubled, inspired by Joyce's Finnegans Wake: \"I date my beginning from this concert\", Cunningham says. During rehearsals, Cage and Cunningham also formulated one of their most fundamental tenets: the separation of music and dance. \"We could agree on a common structure for a particular dance and John could compose to that structure and I could choreograph. In the beginning, there were points in that structure where the music and dance came together. But later we abandoned that and made them entirely independent.\" By the early 50s, at the instigation of Cage, Cunningham began to use \"chance operations\" to formulate the ele ments of his pieces, particularly in the key 1952 piece Suite By Chance: \"The individual sequences, and the length of time, and the directions in space were discovered by tossing coins,\" he says. Many of these ideas were tested and developed not only through Cunningham's occasional performances but also through the famous summer sessions at the celebrated Black Mountain College, North Carolina, where in 1952 Cunningham and Cage masterminded the world's first \"Happening\". That summer in Black Mountain also saw the birth of \"Merce Cunningham and Dance Company\", a startling ensemble of dancers such as Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, Jo-Anne Melsher and Remy Charlip which, over the next few years, would give form to some of Cunningham's ground- breaking works: 1953's Septet, where a still, balletic style is positioned next to the music of Eric Satie, and Minutiae in 1954, which marks the beginning of Robert Rauschenberg's 10-year stint as resident designer. However, it is not just for the quality of the work that the dancers still nostalgically refer to this early period as the Golden Age, but also because of the distinctive company spirit, forged by communal hardships. Reviews were almost universally negative: \"His dance language is for the initiated few who are as interested in contemplating Mr Cunningham's navel as he is himself,\" Dance Magazine said in 1953. \"Have a little Mercy, Merce,\" a later headline would proclaim. But diatribes did little more than steel a curiously robust sense of mission, as the company toured their pieces in a clapped-out Volkswagen bus, often driving inordinate distances for a single performance and playing to meagre audiences: \"It took exactly nine people and a ton of luggage,\" remembers dancer Carolyn Brown. \"We sometimes drove all day and into the wee hours. I remember giving a performance without sleeping at all. But it really was a lot of fun. \"John was a wonderful leader. He and [composer] David Tudor would get into these wonderful conversations. Meanwhile, Merce would be very quiet and study Russian and read or knit. The rest of us would play games. It just was a great time to develop a real company because we were so close together.\" By this time, the relationship between Cunningham and Cage was deeply personal as well as inextricably professional. Prior to this involvement, Cunningham appears to have conducted predominantly heterosexual relationships, both during his time with the Martha Graham company - when he was deeply attached to a Bennington theatre student - and earlier at the Cornish school, when he went out with a dance student named Joyce Holder. \"We were very close but it was always ambiguous,\" Holder recalls. \"I was a little wild and was having many flings. I think that one of the attractions for Merce was that my other boyfriends could take him around in their cars if he needed to go someplace.\" Then, when Holder followed him to New York, she witnessed the formation of the Cage/Cunningham bond in 1942: \"Merce would always hint to me that it was very valuable for his work. Music parts drove him crazy and John composing for him solved that problem. His implication to me always was that their relationship was mutually advantageous on that level.\" Equally indistinct was the nature of the union itself, which remained clandestine for decades: \"I didn't have any inkling,\" says Marianne Simon, who left the company in 1958, \"and I don't think I was alone in that among the female dancers.

Tiring of New York's indifference, the company decided to tour Europe and Asia to showcase some of their strongest work: Winterbranch, a relentless piece based on the theme of falling, featuring La Monte Young's stereophonic buzzsaw soundtrack; Story, which involved scrap remade by Rauschenberg from whatever junk was lying around the theatre; and Crises, in which the dancers were bound by giant elastic bands. At the first major stopover, Paris, they met a familiar reaction: \"People threw things at us,\" Carolyn Brown recalls, \"eggs and tomatoes. During the interval they went out to get more.\" During the Venice dates, things began to pick up; the press reception was respectful and Rauschenberg picked up first prize at the Bienniale art show. However, by the time they reached London, the Merce Cunningham company was being hailed as a sensation: \"At a blow, ballet has been brought right up in line with the front-rank experiments in the other arts,\" raved Alexander Bland in the Observer, \"something which has hardly happened since the days of Diaghilev. Here is heart-warming proof that it is an art with a future, opening up ranges of possibilities which stretch out of sight.\" After an initial scintillating run at Sadler's Wells, attended by everyone from Frederick Ashton to Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev, they transferred for an equally triumphant three-week run at the Phoenix: \"Merce was really quite astonished. In New York, the most he'd ever played was two nights,\" recalls Michael White, who produced the London leg of the tour. The tour proceeded in a rather chaotic fashion through Scandinavia, onward to Prague (where the posters trumpeted dances \"in the style of West Side Story\") and Poland, and then further east to Bombay. By the time they reached Japan, the strain was beginning to tell, with tensions particularly clamorous between Cage and Cunningham on the one hand and on the other between them and Rauschenberg, who had made the mistake of becoming far too famous in the wake of his Venice conquest. After the general critical success of the tour, and particularly the rapture of the London reviewers, subsequently reported in the US press, the entire character of the company changed. While the controversy, the sporadic booing and walkouts, and the financial crises would continue for some decades yet, the critical climate became infinitely more favourable, the company grew in size and professionalism, and Cunningham him self began a steady upward trajectory towards avant garde canonisation. The latter half of the 60s saw further Cunningham highlights, notably 1968's Walkaround Time, which employed sets based on Marcel Duchamp's Large Glass, and the stunning piece Rainforest, also in the same year, strewn with Andy Warhol's helium-filled pillows. In the 70s and early 80s, alongside the video artist Charles Atlas, Cunningham coopted video techniques in pieces such as 1975's Blue Studio: Five Segments, and Channel/Inserts in 1981. By the early 90s Cunningham's physical condition was beginning to severely restrict how much he could perform or even demonstrate to the dancers, and he turned to computer technology, devising ever more ingeniously abstract and random steps using a computer program called LifeForms. Still on the cutting edge at the age of 81, he has taken this a step forward in a work called Biped, which uses state of the art Motion Capture technology to record the movements of his dancers and reproduce them as computer animations within the dance. As audiences at London's Barbican will discover next week, the piece, featuring the music of Gavin Bryars, is mesmerising, the ultimate combination of art and technology. The main event during this latest period of Cunningham's work and life was, of course, the death of Cage in August 1992. After returning from the New York studio to their Sixth Avenue apartment, Cunningham discovered him collapsed on the kitchen floor, having suffered a stroke. Despite the many difficulties in their relationship, the two men had been, according to Cage's assistant Laura Kuhn, \"very affectionate\" in their final years together, openly so perhaps for the first time, now that neither had anything left to prove. The loss of Cage would shatter a dynamic established over half a century: \"Because John answered the questions so brilliantly, I kept my mouth shut. But suddenly he was not around to do it. And so I was forced to speak.\" Most tellingly, however, Cunningham was back in the studio the day after Cage's death: \"I decided quite quickly: 'Well, John is dead, there is nothing I can do about that, and I'm just going to go on.' I thought about it. I would find my own solution.\" That solution was of course, the work - the force that had sustained and nourished their relationship, made sense of the affairs and the infidelities, smoothed over the petty jealousies. Cunningham's obsession with his work was also the force that drove him, perhaps, to take risks with his body, to continue performing long after it was wise, to demand - and often get - the impossible from his dancers, to push his choreography beyond the bounds of what was thought possible. \"You have to love dancing to stick to it,\" he has written, \"It gives nothing back, no manuscripts to store away, no paintings to show on walls and maybe hang in museums, no poems to be printed and sold, nothing but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive. It is not for unsteady souls.\" Life at a glance: Mercier Philip Cunningham Born: April 16 1919 Centralia, Washington, USA.

He knows exactly the self-doubt and draining confidence caused by Hussain's sequence of low scores, which produced only 92 runs in six Tests and a total of 166 in all first-class cricket. </p> <p>Now, with Hussain showing signs of recapturing his form with an innings of 95 in the eight-wicket win over Bangladesh on Thursday, England's coach has gone public about what Hussain went through. </p> <p>\"Nasser hated the thought that he was letting down the team,\" Fletcher said yesterday. \"But I didn't see any big changes in him. He was a little tense occasionally but, to be honest, I thought he'd be more moody than he was. He handled the situation very well.\" </p> <p>The pair have developed a close friendship during their year at the helm. Fletcher said that at no stage did Hussain wallow in self-pity; he was concerned only that his lack of runs were undermining England's chances of success. </p> <p>\"Nasser is a scrapper and we all backed him. We never stopped believing he could do the job with the bat. Now I'm certain he feels more confident. He seems a lot happier. </p> <p>\"I don't think people understand what being England captain involves. It's not just captaining 10 other individuals, you have all the off-the-field stuff as well as trying to keep on top of your own game. It won't get easier having beaten Zimbabwe and West Indies, because people's expectations will now be higher.\" </p> <p>Hussain's runs and the team's comprehensive win combined to make a near-perfect start to England's winter activities.

      "bodyText": "Nobody was closer to Nasser Hussain during the England captain's batting horrors last summer than Duncan Fletcher. He knows exactly the self-doubt and draining confidence caused by Hussain's sequence of low scores, which produced only 92 runs in six Tests and a total of 166 in all first-class cricket. Now, with Hussain showing signs of recapturing his form with an innings of 95 in the eight-wicket win over Bangladesh on Thursday, England's coach has gone public about what Hussain went through. \"Nasser hated the thought that he was letting down the team,\" Fletcher said yesterday. \"But I didn't see any big changes in him. He was a little tense occasionally but, to be honest, I thought he'd be more moody than he was. He handled the situation very well.\" The pair have developed a close friendship during their year at the helm. Fletcher said that at no stage did Hussain wallow in self-pity; he was concerned only that his lack of runs were undermining England's chances of success. \"Nasser is a scrapper and we all backed him. We never stopped believing he could do the job with the bat. Now I'm certain he feels more confident. He seems a lot happier. \"I don't think people understand what being England captain involves. It's not just captaining 10 other individuals, you have all the off-the-field stuff as well as trying to keep on top of your own game. It won't get easier having beaten Zimbabwe and West Indies, because people's expectations will now be higher.\" Hussain's runs and the team's comprehensive win combined to make a near-perfect start to England's winter activities. Fletcher's only concern was the fielding; they missed at least four shies at the stumps, fumbled several balls and dropped six difficult chances. Fletcher thinks the main reason is that the ball here arrives a fraction more quickly than normal because of the altitude - Nairobi is at 5,300ft - and said England would work hard on their fielding in the next three days. Essex's Paul Grayson is expected to arrive today, having been summoned because of Ashley Giles's leg injury. But Fletcher was adamant that Grayson's selection had nothing to do with Robert Croft's outburst last month after missing selection for the winter; the selectors simply wanted another left-arm spinner as cover for Giles.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Things began to go wrong for Kevin Keegan in his third match in charge of England, the 0-0 draw with Sweden at Wembley in June 1999. In that game, Graeme le Saux's last for England, the Chelsea man went off at half-time suffering from a virus. England's left side has not had a settled look since. Keegan's team against Bulgaria four days later included Le Saux's replacement, Sunderland's Michael Gray, in an unfamiliar line-up (only David Seaman survives to start today's game). But untested youth gave way to old faithful Stuart Pearce in a 4-4-2 formation for the last two Euro 2000 qualifiers. Then, after flirting with Steve Guppy for a friendly against Belgium, Keegan settled on Phil Neville as the solution to his problem for the pre-Euro 2000 friendlies and the tournament itself. With results that are all too well known. For last month's friendly against France, Gareth Barry filled the slot, but his immediate international future seems to rest either on England reverting to 3-5-2 or on the uncertain fitness of Tony Adams and Martin Keown. So, after 16 months and 14 less than glorious matches, it's back to Le Saux. Will it prove another turning point for Keegan? </p> <p> Given England's frailty on the left it comes as a shock to discover that Graeme le Saux has not spent the week in bed wrapped in cotton wool. Instead there he was in training, galloping down the wing and whipping over a perfect cross for Robbie Fowler. Bum cheeks were not pointed at him on this occasion. </p> <p>A simple practice exercise maybe, but a reminder of what England missed at Euro 2000 all the same. If Phil Neville's tackle against Romania is the enduring image of the summer's left-sided crisis, it can hardly be forgotten that going forward England displayed the balance Ann Widdecombe might expect after a few joints. </p> <p>Ray Harford, who coached and managed Le Saux at Blackburn and trained Neville with the England Under-21s, knows how welcome Le Saux's return against Germany today will be after a 16-month international absence because of injury. \"If I wanted someone to defend for me between Graeme and Phil Neville it would always be Phil Neville,\" he says. \"But football is like a fight.

      "bodyText": "Things began to go wrong for Kevin Keegan in his third match in charge of England, the 0-0 draw with Sweden at Wembley in June 1999. In that game, Graeme le Saux's last for England, the Chelsea man went off at half-time suffering from a virus. England's left side has not had a settled look since. Keegan's team against Bulgaria four days later included Le Saux's replacement, Sunderland's Michael Gray, in an unfamiliar line-up (only David Seaman survives to start today's game). But untested youth gave way to old faithful Stuart Pearce in a 4-4-2 formation for the last two Euro 2000 qualifiers. Then, after flirting with Steve Guppy for a friendly against Belgium, Keegan settled on Phil Neville as the solution to his problem for the pre-Euro 2000 friendlies and the tournament itself. With results that are all too well known. For last month's friendly against France, Gareth Barry filled the slot, but his immediate international future seems to rest either on England reverting to 3-5-2 or on the uncertain fitness of Tony Adams and Martin Keown. So, after 16 months and 14 less than glorious matches, it's back to Le Saux. Will it prove another turning point for Keegan? Given England's frailty on the left it comes as a shock to discover that Graeme le Saux has not spent the week in bed wrapped in cotton wool. Instead there he was in training, galloping down the wing and whipping over a perfect cross for Robbie Fowler. Bum cheeks were not pointed at him on this occasion. A simple practice exercise maybe, but a reminder of what England missed at Euro 2000 all the same. If Phil Neville's tackle against Romania is the enduring image of the summer's left-sided crisis, it can hardly be forgotten that going forward England displayed the balance Ann Widdecombe might expect after a few joints. Ray Harford, who coached and managed Le Saux at Blackburn and trained Neville with the England Under-21s, knows how welcome Le Saux's return against Germany today will be after a 16-month international absence because of injury. \"If I wanted someone to defend for me between Graeme and Phil Neville it would always be Phil Neville,\" he says. \"But football is like a fight. If you keep taking punches and don't throw some back you're going to get knocked out. \"What Graeme will do is go outside people and get crosses in. We were obsessed with that at Blackburn. The best ball is the old Stanley Matthews ball, behind the full-back and pulled back.

      "body": "<p>Every once in a while the world of football clears its throat and spits out a fallen power whose decline has been so dramatic and undignified that the subsequent outpouring of sympathy comes with a gnawing sense of embarrassment. </p> <p>Brian Clough's last, puffy-faced days in management made for just such a scenario. George Best, the person rather than the player, made for another. And now, on a grander scale, it looks like the turn of Sheffield Wednesday. </p> <p>Bottom of the first division, six defeats in nine games with six goals scored and 18 conceded, eight weeks into the season and Wednesday are falling like a stone in a well. </p> <p>Last season a gang of four local MPs, led by Joe Ashton, demanded that Danny Wilson be fired as manager halfway through the campaign. They got their way eventually but relegation from the Premiership could not be averted. </p> <p>After Joe Kinnear turned them down, Paul Jewell then gambled his reputation by leaving Bradford City, whom he had kept in the Premiership against all odds, and jumping into the Wednesday camp. </p> <p>How far they will drop remains to be seen but if Jewell had hoped the Owls would yo-yo back into the Premiership, he clearly overestimated their powers of elasticity. </p> <p>\"What I've seen so far has not been too good, to put it mildly,\" he said. \"I can't tar everyone with the same brush but, if I'm going to be frank, there are too many players here who are just taking the mickey. They are dragging the club down. </p> <p>\"If I'm being honest, I don't know how some can go home and look in the mirror - maybe they have taken down all their mirrors - but given time I will get them out. Some of the players think they are too good to be here and, mark my words, they will go.\" </p> <p>Jewell's credentials indicate he belongs to the slim file of managers capable of lugging Wednesday out of the quicksand, and his threats are not idle. Last week, when his players reported for the coach journey to Gillingham, he told Gilles de Bilde, an anonymous and recalcitrant figure of late, that he did not have a place on the trip. When the Belgian striker protested he got short shrift. Reputations, for Jewell, are a poor substitute for perspiration. </p> <p>\"I've tried everything I can but it has reached the point now where I just have to hope the players' consciences come into it,\" he said. \"We have a lot of young players who are doing well but the club is plummeting because some of the seniors are not willing to put in the same effort. </p> <p>\"What I'm not going to do is insult our supporters by pretending everything is all right when everyone with eyes can see things are anything but.

      "bodyText": "Every once in a while the world of football clears its throat and spits out a fallen power whose decline has been so dramatic and undignified that the subsequent outpouring of sympathy comes with a gnawing sense of embarrassment. Brian Clough's last, puffy-faced days in management made for just such a scenario. George Best, the person rather than the player, made for another. And now, on a grander scale, it looks like the turn of Sheffield Wednesday. Bottom of the first division, six defeats in nine games with six goals scored and 18 conceded, eight weeks into the season and Wednesday are falling like a stone in a well. Last season a gang of four local MPs, led by Joe Ashton, demanded that Danny Wilson be fired as manager halfway through the campaign. They got their way eventually but relegation from the Premiership could not be averted. After Joe Kinnear turned them down, Paul Jewell then gambled his reputation by leaving Bradford City, whom he had kept in the Premiership against all odds, and jumping into the Wednesday camp. How far they will drop remains to be seen but if Jewell had hoped the Owls would yo-yo back into the Premiership, he clearly overestimated their powers of elasticity. \"What I've seen so far has not been too good, to put it mildly,\" he said. \"I can't tar everyone with the same brush but, if I'm going to be frank, there are too many players here who are just taking the mickey. They are dragging the club down. \"If I'm being honest, I don't know how some can go home and look in the mirror - maybe they have taken down all their mirrors - but given time I will get them out. Some of the players think they are too good to be here and, mark my words, they will go.\" Jewell's credentials indicate he belongs to the slim file of managers capable of lugging Wednesday out of the quicksand, and his threats are not idle. Last week, when his players reported for the coach journey to Gillingham, he told Gilles de Bilde, an anonymous and recalcitrant figure of late, that he did not have a place on the trip. When the Belgian striker protested he got short shrift. Reputations, for Jewell, are a poor substitute for perspiration. \"I've tried everything I can but it has reached the point now where I just have to hope the players' consciences come into it,\" he said. \"We have a lot of young players who are doing well but the club is plummeting because some of the seniors are not willing to put in the same effort. \"What I'm not going to do is insult our supporters by pretending everything is all right when everyone with eyes can see things are anything but. But I will see it through and I will come through the other side. I'll put everything I have into it although my only ambition at the moment is to keep this club in the first division.\" Something that will be easier said than done judging by their efforts so far.

      "body": "<p>Within the canon devoted to great football cock-ups abroad, probably only Scotland could concoct the sort of drama that unfolded on Italy's Adriatic coast yesterday. </p> <p>Scotland are based in the idyllic town of Rimini before playing a supposedly ordinary World Cup Group Six qualifier against San Marino tonight. But, before a ball has been kicked, the place is already in ferment. </p> <p>The cause of the latest furore is Jim Leighton, the most capped and surely the most bandy-legged goalkeeper ever to play for Scotland, who joined the squad on the flight out of Glasgow on Thursday, ostensibly to do some coaching with the Under-21 squad. </p> <p>Leighton, though, over the in-flight refreshments, omitted to tell the Scotland manager Craig Brown that extracts from his forthcoming autobiography were being serialised in a tabloid newspaper this weekend. He also omitted to tell Brown that within those extracts would be some stinging criticisms of Brown's international set-up. </p> <p>Specifically, Leighton's book attacks Alan Hodgkinson, the Scotland squad's goalkeeping coach, who for years had worked with Leighton on Scotland trips before the goalkeeper's retirement, despite rumours of bad blood between the two. Hodgkinson is on this trip for Scotland's World Cup double-header against San Marino and Croatia, and not surprisingly is said to be fuming. </p> <p>Yesterday, news of Leighton's impending serialisation provoked outrage in the Scottish media and, perhaps inevitably, led to Brown relieving Leighton of his duties with the squad. Hodgkinson, meanwhile, has been roaming around with a red face threatening to sue the former Aberdeen goalkeeper. Leighton himself spent yesterday afternoon on the phone to the Mail on Sunday, trying desperately to pull himself out of trouble. </p> <p>\"In the light of what I have heard about Jim's book extracts I have chosen to relieve him of his duties with us,\" announced a peeved Brown. </p> <p>\"When I originally invited him to work with the squad I knew nothing of his book. Then, last Friday, when I became aware of the serialisation I got on to Jim and asked him if there would be anything in them which would specifically criticise our set-up. Jim told me that there would not be. </p> <p>\"Jim said that he has a veto on what the paper carries, and that, while we are abroad with Scotland, nothing critical would come out. This, though, now appears not to be the case. Given that there will be extracts which may criticise me and almost certainly Alan [Hodgkinson] I have chosen to relieve Jim of his duties and he fully understands the decision. Our squad's harmony must come first.\" </p> <p>In the entire saga it has been hard to calculate who has been the more foolish in this trivial but disruptive incident: Brown for including Leighton when he clearly did not get on with Hodgkinson, or Leighton himself for being so silly as to accept the invitation while slaughtering his paymasters in print back home. </p> <p>David Taylor, the recently appointed SFA chief executive who must now have some idea of the carry-ons that engulfed Jim Farry, said: \"We cannot condone one member of our staff criticising others like this. It is a situation that has been created and it is only right that Leighton be asked to leave.\" </p> <p>But to add to the embarrassment, Leighton will not in fact be leaving Italy.

      "bodyText": "Within the canon devoted to great football cock-ups abroad, probably only Scotland could concoct the sort of drama that unfolded on Italy's Adriatic coast yesterday. Scotland are based in the idyllic town of Rimini before playing a supposedly ordinary World Cup Group Six qualifier against San Marino tonight. But, before a ball has been kicked, the place is already in ferment. The cause of the latest furore is Jim Leighton, the most capped and surely the most bandy-legged goalkeeper ever to play for Scotland, who joined the squad on the flight out of Glasgow on Thursday, ostensibly to do some coaching with the Under-21 squad. Leighton, though, over the in-flight refreshments, omitted to tell the Scotland manager Craig Brown that extracts from his forthcoming autobiography were being serialised in a tabloid newspaper this weekend. He also omitted to tell Brown that within those extracts would be some stinging criticisms of Brown's international set-up. Specifically, Leighton's book attacks Alan Hodgkinson, the Scotland squad's goalkeeping coach, who for years had worked with Leighton on Scotland trips before the goalkeeper's retirement, despite rumours of bad blood between the two. Hodgkinson is on this trip for Scotland's World Cup double-header against San Marino and Croatia, and not surprisingly is said to be fuming. Yesterday, news of Leighton's impending serialisation provoked outrage in the Scottish media and, perhaps inevitably, led to Brown relieving Leighton of his duties with the squad. Hodgkinson, meanwhile, has been roaming around with a red face threatening to sue the former Aberdeen goalkeeper. Leighton himself spent yesterday afternoon on the phone to the Mail on Sunday, trying desperately to pull himself out of trouble. \"In the light of what I have heard about Jim's book extracts I have chosen to relieve him of his duties with us,\" announced a peeved Brown. \"When I originally invited him to work with the squad I knew nothing of his book. Then, last Friday, when I became aware of the serialisation I got on to Jim and asked him if there would be anything in them which would specifically criticise our set-up. Jim told me that there would not be. \"Jim said that he has a veto on what the paper carries, and that, while we are abroad with Scotland, nothing critical would come out. This, though, now appears not to be the case. Given that there will be extracts which may criticise me and almost certainly Alan [Hodgkinson] I have chosen to relieve Jim of his duties and he fully understands the decision. Our squad's harmony must come first.\" In the entire saga it has been hard to calculate who has been the more foolish in this trivial but disruptive incident: Brown for including Leighton when he clearly did not get on with Hodgkinson, or Leighton himself for being so silly as to accept the invitation while slaughtering his paymasters in print back home. David Taylor, the recently appointed SFA chief executive who must now have some idea of the carry-ons that engulfed Jim Farry, said: \"We cannot condone one member of our staff criticising others like this. It is a situation that has been created and it is only right that Leighton be asked to leave.\" But to add to the embarrassment, Leighton will not in fact be leaving Italy. Instead he will be commenting on Scotland's performance in Radio 5 Live's coverage of the match tonight. As to the game itself, normal news such as who will actually play has been overshadowed by all the internal wranglings, but Newcastle's Kevin Gallacher is expected to captain the team on the occasion of his 50th cap. Leighton collected 91 of those, but throughout the highs and lows of his long career it is hard to recall the bespectacled goalkeeper dropping quite such a clanger as this.",

Although the player has won only two caps, the impact he made as a substitute against Germany in Charleroi during Euro 2000, when England were clinging to a 1-0 lead, clearly marked him out as a probable for the World Cup.

England's early, fumbling departure from Euro 2000 may have confirmed the doubts about his appointment which still linger in some minds. But if England can take at least four points from this afternoon's match with Germany and Wednesday's qualifier in Finland, Keegan will be spared a renewal of the speculation about his future which followed the retreat from Charleroi. </p> <p>\"I feel more in the job now than I did before and during Euro 2000,\" Keegan said yesterday. \"This is the start of a new campaign and I can no longer say that when I came in we'd got four points from nine, which is basically where I was.

You can even have the twin towers for a quid, but like all proper bring-and-buy sales, you will have to collect them. And then when you get them home you'll discover they only have three sides. Meanwhile, all this week, we have been told that this afternoon's game between England and Germany will be the last ever staged in the ground before the wrecking ball finally swings into view. Which is not strictly true. For the next fortnight, every moment of every day has been rented out to anyone prepared to fork out \u00a325,000 an hour for the privilege of playing on the hallowed turf. There will be more matches scheduled in the stadium after its advertised end than were played in its first five years of existence. Newspapers have bought slots to sell to readers, Radio Five Live is running a competition to enable listeners to stroll down the sacred tunnel listening to the pre-recorded roar of the crowd, while several of the sessions have been bought by the wealthy for a kickaround with their chums. The 365 corporation, purveyors of fine sporting websites, thought it would be appropriate to invite the most famous footballer never to have played at Wembley to join in the match they have bought: Pele, who once said the only regret of his long and successful career was not stepping out on the sacred turf. But, far from snapping off the hand proffering the invitation, a fee was demanded by the great man. A fee so vast it suggests that it is not just in the boardroom of Wembley plc that sentiment takes second place to commerce.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This week it has emerged that a small UK-listed company claiming to be the victim of bulletin board market manipulation is taking legal action against the chat room user who posted the rumours. </p> <p>This news will send shivers down the spines of all web sites, ISPs and bulletin board operators, who are nervous in the extreme about libel and the net. The attitude is understandable; the laws surrounding internet regulation are nebulous to non-existent and any case law has international implications. </p> <p>In this case, the threatened legal action is over negative information posted about its overseas operations. The share price shot down. The company in question says the information was completely incorrect. </p> <p>So, just how can the private investor verify the contents of the many regulated, and unregulated, financial cyber lounges? The simple answer is that they cannot, and the Financial Services Authority in March issued a warning to this effect. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Motley Fool site, which operates over a thousand bulletin boards, argues the financial chatrooms tend to be self-regulating. \"If someone posts an incorrect comment, generally the rest of the community will react quickly and clamp down on it. It's a bit like turning up at a dinner party when everyone is having a serious discussion and you come in with a silly comment. You will quickly be told to keep quiet.\" </p> <p>He adds that the Motley Fool has created a philosophy of genuine interest in long-term investing and that people who sign up to the board also sign up to this community. </p> <p>Motley Fool does, however, employ 12 people whose sole role is to monitor the boards. They are automatically alerted every time someone clicks on the \"problem post\" link. The spokesman says that not every post will automatically be removed, but it will be investigated. Similarly, Hemscott employs a compliance officer, part of whose job is to check for dodgy board entries. </p> <p>In August, interactive investor international (iii) introduced a requirement for all participants in discussions to submit their email address before posting. The address is verified by sending an email containing a link which must be clicked before the person can contribute to the board, meaning posters using hotmail or even internet cafes, can be tracked. </p> <p>The FSA and the Stock Exchange monitor the boards on an even more sporadic basis, although this will become more formalised next year once the Financial Services Market Act comes into effect. </p> <p>If legal action were to be brought against the board providers, it would use the defence of \"innocent disseminator\": in other words, there is no way that it can effectively monitor everything that is being written, but what the individual posters should remember is that unless you are qualified to do so, giving financial advice -such as tipping shares - is a criminal offence and perpetrators could be imprisoned for up to seven years. </p> <p>A London company called IBNet is about to start marketing software which monitors all mention of a specific company anywhere on the internet. The CEO, Mark Ommanney, says the product is a result of his own company's experience of fallacious comment that its shares had been suspended. </p> <p>\"The post was on iii and purported to be sourced from an article in the Evening Standard. I checked, and there was no such article, so I called my broker to check whether or not it was true. It wasn't, so my next action was to call my PR company. A message was posted on the same board to say that the rumour was not true, and fortunately, this quashed all discussion of the issue,\" he says. </p> <p>He adds that while the iii monitoring service works - allowing people who are unhappy with the contents of a board discussion to appeal directly to iii to have it thrown off site - he felt it was better to counter rumour with truth, rather than having the original posting removed. </p> <p>A spokesman for iii says: \"The boards form an important component for discussion and the potentially libellous information is very much the exception and not the rule.\" </p> <p>Earlier this year Scoot, the online information directory, found confidential company information was being leaked onto various boards, including iii. A court order was issued and the boards were forced to hand over email addresses of the posters. </p> <p>Paul Carratu runs a detective agency offering a dot.com monitoring service. His clients tend to operate in sensitive areas. He watches UK and international financial bulletin boards and gen- eral chat rooms for mention of the client which is suspic-ious, controversial or wrong. </p> <p>\"Nine times out of 10 we don't know ourselves whether or not the information is misleading, so we just pass it to the company to investigate,\" he says.</p>",

This news will send shivers down the spines of all web sites, ISPs and bulletin board operators, who are nervous in the extreme about libel and the net. The attitude is understandable; the laws surrounding internet regulation are nebulous to non-existent and any case law has international implications. In this case, the threatened legal action is over negative information posted about its overseas operations. The share price shot down. The company in question says the information was completely incorrect. So, just how can the private investor verify the contents of the many regulated, and unregulated, financial cyber lounges? The simple answer is that they cannot, and the Financial Services Authority in March issued a warning to this effect. A spokesman for the Motley Fool site, which operates over a thousand bulletin boards, argues the financial chatrooms tend to be self-regulating. \"If someone posts an incorrect comment, generally the rest of the community will react quickly and clamp down on it. It's a bit like turning up at a dinner party when everyone is having a serious discussion and you come in with a silly comment. You will quickly be told to keep quiet.\" He adds that the Motley Fool has created a philosophy of genuine interest in long-term investing and that people who sign up to the board also sign up to this community. Motley Fool does, however, employ 12 people whose sole role is to monitor the boards. They are automatically alerted every time someone clicks on the \"problem post\" link. The spokesman says that not every post will automatically be removed, but it will be investigated. Similarly, Hemscott employs a compliance officer, part of whose job is to check for dodgy board entries. In August, interactive investor international (iii) introduced a requirement for all participants in discussions to submit their email address before posting. The address is verified by sending an email containing a link which must be clicked before the person can contribute to the board, meaning posters using hotmail or even internet cafes, can be tracked. The FSA and the Stock Exchange monitor the boards on an even more sporadic basis, although this will become more formalised next year once the Financial Services Market Act comes into effect. If legal action were to be brought against the board providers, it would use the defence of \"innocent disseminator\": in other words, there is no way that it can effectively monitor everything that is being written, but what the individual posters should remember is that unless you are qualified to do so, giving financial advice -such as tipping shares - is a criminal offence and perpetrators could be imprisoned for up to seven years. A London company called IBNet is about to start marketing software which monitors all mention of a specific company anywhere on the internet. The CEO, Mark Ommanney, says the product is a result of his own company's experience of fallacious comment that its shares had been suspended. \"The post was on iii and purported to be sourced from an article in the Evening Standard. I checked, and there was no such article, so I called my broker to check whether or not it was true. It wasn't, so my next action was to call my PR company. A message was posted on the same board to say that the rumour was not true, and fortunately, this quashed all discussion of the issue,\" he says. He adds that while the iii monitoring service works - allowing people who are unhappy with the contents of a board discussion to appeal directly to iii to have it thrown off site - he felt it was better to counter rumour with truth, rather than having the original posting removed. A spokesman for iii says: \"The boards form an important component for discussion and the potentially libellous information is very much the exception and not the rule.\" Earlier this year Scoot, the online information directory, found confidential company information was being leaked onto various boards, including iii. A court order was issued and the boards were forced to hand over email addresses of the posters. Paul Carratu runs a detective agency offering a dot.com monitoring service. His clients tend to operate in sensitive areas. He watches UK and international financial bulletin boards and gen- eral chat rooms for mention of the client which is suspic-ious, controversial or wrong. \"Nine times out of 10 we don't know ourselves whether or not the information is misleading, so we just pass it to the company to investigate,\" he says.",

And a single case, taken through the courts and to appeal, can mean legal fees of up to \u00a3500,000. These cases include claims for stress, distress and emotional trauma, along with the more conventional personal accident and injury claims.</p> <p>\"This is the public's money that's being spent, and if it's going in insurance and compensation then it's not going into front-line services. If this rate of increase continues then eventually the entire local government budget is going to disappear into settling claims,\" says Zurich Municipal's David Forster. Accounting for the increase, he says, is a change in public attitude. \"We've seen a cultural shift where people seem to believe that when something goes wrong, it's someone else's fault. And if you can find someone to blame, you claim compensation.\"</p> <p>There have been accusations that stoking this rise in claims have been the advertising campaigns of companies such as Claims Direct, which take on compensation cases on a no-win, no-fee arrangement. These television adverts tell people that if they've been involved in an accident that wasn't their fault that they could be in line for a pay-out.</p> <p>Claims Direct argues that they're extending the legal services to the general public which have always been available to the well-off and that if someone has a legitimate claim for compensation then it's entirely proper for them to be given assistance. The company says that there has been a rapid increase in calls, now running at 30,000 a month.</p> <p>But it says it has a rigorous vetting procedure before claims even reach solicitors' desks and at present rejects five out of six approaches, advancing only 5,000 claims a month, of which they would hope over 90% would be successful.</p> <p>In many ways it isn't a bad thing that consumers can get such legal support when they have problems, especially if it makes service providers think twice about the consequences of letting standards slip. Even though we might be suspicious of a whinge-culture, we now expect to receive financial recompense when we're badly let down, such as for holiday disasters or travel disruption.</p> <p>But there is also a sense in which the compensation culture is a spin-off of the attitude that says that nothing is anybody's personal responsibility anymore. If you walk into a wall, it's the wall's fault for being there. There used to be an insurance advert about not making a drama out of a crisis. Now there's a growing industry dedicated to making a court case out of a crisis. </p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",

Accounting for the increase, he says, is a change in public attitude. \"We've seen a cultural shift where people seem to believe that when something goes wrong, it's someone else's fault. And if you can find someone to blame, you claim compensation.\" There have been accusations that stoking this rise in claims have been the advertising campaigns of companies such as Claims Direct, which take on compensation cases on a no-win, no-fee arrangement. These television adverts tell people that if they've been involved in an accident that wasn't their fault that they could be in line for a pay-out. Claims Direct argues that they're extending the legal services to the general public which have always been available to the well-off and that if someone has a legitimate claim for compensation then it's entirely proper for them to be given assistance. The company says that there has been a rapid increase in calls, now running at 30,000 a month. But it says it has a rigorous vetting procedure before claims even reach solicitors' desks and at present rejects five out of six approaches, advancing only 5,000 claims a month, of which they would hope over 90% would be successful. In many ways it isn't a bad thing that consumers can get such legal support when they have problems, especially if it makes service providers think twice about the consequences of letting standards slip. Even though we might be suspicious of a whinge-culture, we now expect to receive financial recompense when we're badly let down, such as for holiday disasters or travel disruption. But there is also a sense in which the compensation culture is a spin-off of the attitude that says that nothing is anybody's personal responsibility anymore. If you walk into a wall, it's the wall's fault for being there. There used to be an insurance advert about not making a drama out of a crisis. Now there's a growing industry dedicated to making a court case out of a crisis. Email: coughlan_sean@hotmail.com",

      "byline": "Ron Atkinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Kevin Keegan has more or less confirmed that Michael Owen and Andrew Cole will play up front against Germany tomorrow. Both strikers are in such brilliant form that I understand his decision but it's not what I would have gone with. </p> <p>I'm a big fan of the shape we saw in Paris last month, with Paul Scholes operating behind Cole. Yes, that means leaving Owen on the bench again, but I prefer the idea of throwing him on when games get stretched and defenders are tired. </p> <p>When there is space behind back lines there are few better than Owen at exploiting it, and he should become an all-time great. But as it is, if Germany defend deep I'm not sure he will be as effective. </p> <p>That's why employing a link-man such as Scholes can have a real impact. At international level you've got to be patient and cunning and look to pull defenders about. Scholes would set Germany's defence problems, and if he is coming short our midfielders can get past him. They're always harder to pick up coming from deep positions. </p> <p>Cole has developed his game excellently at Manchester United playing with his partner dropping off, and you don't want to stifle his ability to play on the last man and use his movement. He showed against Chelsea that when he gets one on one with defenders he can beat them. </p> <p>Owen, of course, has also been on fire. But like Cole his game is based on movement and running on defenders' shoulders. The problem with that pair might be that the ball won't stick up there and England will lose possession. Holding things up and bringing people into play is not Owen's strongest suit. </p> <p>All the same, I understand Kevin's thinking, particularly as England are at home, and I hope the partnership works. Both players are scoring freely and their pace and movement could cause problems for a German defence which can be static. </p> <p>But that depends on whether England play to their strengths. It's no good banging high or long balls to them. Shorter passes will have to be played through from midfield and crosses skimmed over, which is why I think David Beckham will go wide right and Graeme le Saux will get the job on the other flank. </p> <p>I would keep Beckham in the middle of a 3-5-1-1 formation, playing: Seaman; Keown, Adams, Barry; G Neville, Dyer/McManaman, Beckham, Gerrard, Le Saux; Scholes; A Cole. </p> <p>But however England line up they must get on to Christian Ziege quickly to stop him delivering high-quality crosses, and they have to play with bags of energy and freedom. The players have to be confident and make Germany chase the ball. </p> <p>Much as I would love to see England win, I think a draw is more likely from a tight game. Germany are not a great side but they will be organised and highly motivated. </p> <p>Far from being affected by the scandal surrounding Christoph Daum, I'm sure they'll be laughing their heads off and making light of it. And it should not be forgotten that although England won in Charleroi, Germany were maybe the better side. </p> <p> W hat will help England is if Mehmet Scholl is forced out by his knee injury.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Keegan has more or less confirmed that Michael Owen and Andrew Cole will play up front against Germany tomorrow. Both strikers are in such brilliant form that I understand his decision but it's not what I would have gone with. I'm a big fan of the shape we saw in Paris last month, with Paul Scholes operating behind Cole. Yes, that means leaving Owen on the bench again, but I prefer the idea of throwing him on when games get stretched and defenders are tired. When there is space behind back lines there are few better than Owen at exploiting it, and he should become an all-time great. But as it is, if Germany defend deep I'm not sure he will be as effective. That's why employing a link-man such as Scholes can have a real impact. At international level you've got to be patient and cunning and look to pull defenders about. Scholes would set Germany's defence problems, and if he is coming short our midfielders can get past him. They're always harder to pick up coming from deep positions. Cole has developed his game excellently at Manchester United playing with his partner dropping off, and you don't want to stifle his ability to play on the last man and use his movement. He showed against Chelsea that when he gets one on one with defenders he can beat them. Owen, of course, has also been on fire. But like Cole his game is based on movement and running on defenders' shoulders. The problem with that pair might be that the ball won't stick up there and England will lose possession. Holding things up and bringing people into play is not Owen's strongest suit. All the same, I understand Kevin's thinking, particularly as England are at home, and I hope the partnership works. Both players are scoring freely and their pace and movement could cause problems for a German defence which can be static. But that depends on whether England play to their strengths. It's no good banging high or long balls to them. Shorter passes will have to be played through from midfield and crosses skimmed over, which is why I think David Beckham will go wide right and Graeme le Saux will get the job on the other flank. I would keep Beckham in the middle of a 3-5-1-1 formation, playing: Seaman; Keown, Adams, Barry; G Neville, Dyer/McManaman, Beckham, Gerrard, Le Saux; Scholes; A Cole. But however England line up they must get on to Christian Ziege quickly to stop him delivering high-quality crosses, and they have to play with bags of energy and freedom. The players have to be confident and make Germany chase the ball. Much as I would love to see England win, I think a draw is more likely from a tight game. Germany are not a great side but they will be organised and highly motivated. Far from being affected by the scandal surrounding Christoph Daum, I'm sure they'll be laughing their heads off and making light of it. And it should not be forgotten that although England won in Charleroi, Germany were maybe the better side. W hat will help England is if Mehmet Scholl is forced out by his knee injury. Carsten Jancker and Oliver Bierhoff are strikers Tony Adams and Martin Keown like to go against. They're not bright, sharp forwards who drop off and pull into little areas. I'll be sad to see Wembley's twin towers disappear. Having been to plenty of grounds in Italy and Spain I can assure you Wembley is not as outdated as some people think.

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson last night sparked new controversy when he warned Ulster Unionists that they faced a regime of joint authority involving the Irish government if devolution failed again and there was another return to direct rule. Angry unionists saw his comments as inflammatory. Mr Mandelson's move came as the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was beginning a fresh fight for political survival after party dissidents demanded another meeting of the 860-strong ruling council. The outlook for the Good Friday agreement once more appears to be grim. Mr Mandelson gave several interviews in an attempt to shore up Mr Trimble, who is seen as key to the survival of the 30-month accord. He told Ulster Television that if the agreement fell, Ulster Unionists faced: \"possibly not even just direct rule, but both governments interfering directly in the affairs of Northern Ireland.\" Mr Trimble, who has been dismissive of the dissidents' move ahead of tomorrow's annual party conference, is expected to attempt to delay the council meeting until next month. He will then have a clearer picture of the government's plans on the policing bill, and will be able to determine tactics accordingly. Dissidents want to force Ulster Unionists out of the province's power-sharing executive, where they sit with Sinn Fein, until the IRA begins to decommission its weapons. The council meeting should take place three weeks after the 60 signatures demanding it were handed to party headquarters late on Wednesday. But procedural wrangling is under way, the aim of which is to buy Mr Trimble a little more breathing space. The Ulster Unionists' leader will test grassroots' opinion at tomorrow's conference. To once more unite the party and try to secure his position as leader, he may yet be forced to forward a motion himself at the subsequent council meeting to offer a timetable for withdrawal from the executive if there is no progress on IRA decommissioning. Mr Trimble, who will also face a Democratic Unionist motion of no confidence in his performance as Northern Ireland's first minister in the assembly on Monday, criticised the dissidents' move, and allies labelled it self-indulgent. He said that it was an attempt to upstage the party conference. There is little doubt the mood among Ulster Unionists is swinging against Mr Trimble, particularly after the party's catastrophic defeat to the DUP in the south Antrim byelection last month. His winning margin at successive ruling council meetings has narrowed, and is now in single figures. Dissidents claimed their move was about policy. They insisted no leadership challenge was intended. But Mr Trimble could hardly stay on if the hardliners forced a switch of his policies. The likely choice would then be between East Londonderry MP Willie Ross, as a stop-gap leader, or Jeffrey Donaldson, who represents Lagan Valley. Both men are strong opponents of the agreement.

      "bodyText": "Doctors were this afternoon given the go-ahead to withdraw artificial life-support on two women patients suffering a \"living death\" after suffering brain damage. The case went before the head of the high court's family division to test the effect of the new Human Rights Act on the right of judges to give doctors the power to end treatment in such cases. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss agreed to make the declarations after hearing evidence and submissions over two days from representatives of two NHS trusts involved and the patients who were diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state. In both cases, Dame Elizabeth said the two women, identified only as Ms H, 36, and Mrs M, 49, lacked the capacity to make decisions as to their future medical treatment. She said it was not in their best interests to continue artificial nutrition and hydration. The judge said all those treating the women could lawfully discontinue all life-sustaining treatment designed to keep them alive and supply treatment and care which may be appropriate to ensure they die with dignity. A statement issued by the hospital trust treating Ms H read: \"The decision today represents a further stage in what has been and continues to be a difficult and very sad time for everyone involved in this tragic case.\" The hospital treating Mrs M said: \"It is the wish of the family and those responsible for the medical and nursing care of this patient that she is permitted to end her life peacefully and with dignity.\" Dame Elizabeth was told that court decisions which began with the case of Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland in 1993 do not infringe the rights to life enshrined in the Human Rights Act, which came into force at the beginning of the week. John Grace QC, representing the hospitals which are both in the north of England, said: \"Expert independent witnesses agree they are undoubtedly cases of PVS, described as a twilight zone of suspended animation where death commences whilst life continues. A living death.\" He said the medical technology which was keeping them alive did not exist when the European Convention on Human Rights was formulated in 1950. It was accepted by Ben Emmerson QC, representing the two patients, that the principles laid down by the House of Lords in the Bland case complied with the convention and that the declarations sought in both cases did not infringe the Human Rights Act.",

Sixpence had the contents of a chamber pot emptied on her head as she passed below. The wife of one of her gentlemen callers shouted from a window: \"You had him last night, now you can have his remains!\" </p> <p>Another anecdote unearthed by Ms Ariss relates the tale of a gardener working at Bredenbury Court, the Barneby family pile. One day he was planting a bulb in a dismal little restroom provided for estate workers when a maid paid a visit. Not noticing the man seated in the darkness, she pulled down her knickers and sat on his lap. Feeling bare legs beneath her, she leapt up with a shriek, adjusted her dress, and fled. </p> <p>And that astonishing tale has delighted the Bameby family from generation to generation.<br><b>Hereford Times</b></p> <p><b>Rural referendum</b><br>The future of the single European currency was thrown into turmoil this week by the news that villagers in Groby, Leicestershire, have voted against scrapping the pound.</p> <p>But before Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dump the government's wait-and-see policy on the euro, they might glean a crumb of comfort from the news that less than one in 10 villagers voted. </p> <p>Just 522 residents, or 9.14% of the village electorate, voted in a parish poll on the euro. Of those who bothered to vote, 92.7% were against the idea of scrapping the pound, while 88.6% rejected the idea of spending public money on preparing for the euro. </p> <p>Anti-European Union campaigner George West triggered the vote, citing an ancient law which allows villagers to stage referendums. He hailed the result as proof that people did not support the government's stance on the euro. </p> <p>Mr West blamed younger villagers for the low turnout, claiming the youth of today did not understand that their national sovereignty was at stake. </p> <p>Last week, parish polls produced similar results in two other Leicestershire villages, Rothley and Mountsorrel.<br><b>Leicester Mercury</b></p> <p><b>Yee-hah!</b><br>\"I just don't think it is appropriate,\" said the superintendent registrar for Wiltshire. \"There is no legal problem, but I don't want to worry people with the sound of gunfire going off.\" </p> <p>Dorothy Windeat was explaining her decision to ban a couple of country and western music fans from firing replica guns at their wedding at Chippenham register office.</p> <p>George Steele and Doreen Pudney were married at high noon on September 23. They had wanted replica handguns to be fired as they left the ceremony. </p> <p>But Mrs Windeat blocked their plans because she feared that nearby shoppers would be frightened by the sound of gunfire from behind the High Street. </p> <p>\"We would not object as long as the guns were kept out of site of the public and it was a one-off shot,\" said acting inspector Jim Griffey of Chippenham police.

      "bodyText": "Stories from the smallest room The sum of human understanding took a giant leap forward this week thanks to a local historian in Herefordshire. Paddy Ariss also gave Hereford Times sub editors a welcome opportunity to dust down their tried-and-tested punning headlines (\"Flushed With Success\" etc). Herefordshire Privies (Countryside Books, \u00a37.95), a new study by Ms Ariss, of Eardisland, provides insights into the many types of toilets used in the county down the years. She has spent a year painstakingly researching her work, peering over toilet doors, looking down pans and under seats and collating memories on the subject. Priscilla Davies, of Weobley, told Ms Ariss of a woman of ill repute mysteriously nicknamed Sixpence (all sorts of recreational activities were cheaper in those days) in Hay-on-Wye. Sixpence had the contents of a chamber pot emptied on her head as she passed below. The wife of one of her gentlemen callers shouted from a window: \"You had him last night, now you can have his remains!\" Another anecdote unearthed by Ms Ariss relates the tale of a gardener working at Bredenbury Court, the Barneby family pile. One day he was planting a bulb in a dismal little restroom provided for estate workers when a maid paid a visit. Not noticing the man seated in the darkness, she pulled down her knickers and sat on his lap. Feeling bare legs beneath her, she leapt up with a shriek, adjusted her dress, and fled. And that astonishing tale has delighted the Bameby family from generation to generation. Hereford Times Rural referendum The future of the single European currency was thrown into turmoil this week by the news that villagers in Groby, Leicestershire, have voted against scrapping the pound. But before Tony Blair and Gordon Brown dump the government's wait-and-see policy on the euro, they might glean a crumb of comfort from the news that less than one in 10 villagers voted. Just 522 residents, or 9.14% of the village electorate, voted in a parish poll on the euro. Of those who bothered to vote, 92.7% were against the idea of scrapping the pound, while 88.6% rejected the idea of spending public money on preparing for the euro. Anti-European Union campaigner George West triggered the vote, citing an ancient law which allows villagers to stage referendums. He hailed the result as proof that people did not support the government's stance on the euro. Mr West blamed younger villagers for the low turnout, claiming the youth of today did not understand that their national sovereignty was at stake. Last week, parish polls produced similar results in two other Leicestershire villages, Rothley and Mountsorrel. Leicester Mercury Yee-hah! \"I just don't think it is appropriate,\" said the superintendent registrar for Wiltshire. \"There is no legal problem, but I don't want to worry people with the sound of gunfire going off.\" Dorothy Windeat was explaining her decision to ban a couple of country and western music fans from firing replica guns at their wedding at Chippenham register office. George Steele and Doreen Pudney were married at high noon on September 23. They had wanted replica handguns to be fired as they left the ceremony. But Mrs Windeat blocked their plans because she feared that nearby shoppers would be frightened by the sound of gunfire from behind the High Street. \"We would not object as long as the guns were kept out of site of the public and it was a one-off shot,\" said acting inspector Jim Griffey of Chippenham police. But he quickly added: \"It is not within the power of the police to override the power of the superintendent registrar.\" A distraught Mr Steele said he had had his heart set on a wild west wedding with all the trimmings. Miss Pudney, 54, said she had wanted to mark their marriage in style. \"It is very disappointing,\" she said. \"This was going to be the highlight of our wedding because we thought this is how they would have celebrated in those times.\" The ceremony went ahead with happy couple and guests clad in authentic costume. They did not reveal their honeymoon destination. Gazette &amp; Herald, Wiltshire Letter of the week I was disgusted by the condescending and despicable comparison of New York's landmarks with some in Blackburn. It seems that whoever compiled this list is not local and has some sort of grudge against Blackburn. I think it would have been more appropriate to have likened the town hall with the World Trade Centre, or Ewood Park with the Yankee Stadium. As for twinning Whitebirk industrial estate with Central Park, I can only presume you meant Central Park, Wigan! However, the comparison of Larkhill flats to the Bronx is downright insulting and I think an apology is owed to the good people who live in those flats. If you really want to compare some local landmarks with those in New York, how about Darwen Tower with the Empire State Building; Corporation Park with Central Park; Whitebirk roundabout with Staten Island; Queen Victoria's Monument with the Statue of Liberty - and as for the Bronx, I could think of a few places not a million miles away from Blackburn.

      "body": "<p><strong>THE FINAL COUNTDOWN</strong></p> <p>So here we are at last. The day before England take on Germany in the final match at the twin towers of the home of football of Wembley, the national stadium. But, strangely, the Fiver does not feel too excited this afternoon. Rather there's a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the air, almost as if we've spent the entire week poring over every last tendon tweak before a game which is likely to be a tedious replay of a fixture we got worked up about only a couple of months ago. Must be something we ate.</p> <p>Anyway, for one last time, here we go. Kelvin Koogan, England coach, is very excited ahead of tomorrow's crucial crunch clash with the Bosch. Even the withdrawal of Liverpool's Steven Gerrard this afternoon with a recurrence of a groin injury hasn't fazed him. \"It's disappointing for him as it's happened before,\" Koog said. \"But it's probably better to happen in training than after five or ten minutes of the match.\" Too right, and Koog's got loads of other players to choice from anyway. \"With the players I have got I think we are covered double and treble in most positions,\" he said. Please God, don't let it be Paul Ince.</p> <p>A practical example of Koogan's first law aside, the England meistermind refrained from naming his team and surprisingly chose instead to concentrate on the historical significance of the match. \"I have told the 11 players who I have picked, they know this is the opportunity to be part of something special,\" he said. \"Until we lay the ghost of 1966 everyone is going to talk about Moore, Hurst, Peters, Bobby Charlton. But they can do something about that.\" But after a whole hour pondering the subject, the Fiver still isn't sure what.</p> <p>England XI (probable): Seaman; G Neville, Adams, Keown, Le Saux; Barmby, Scholes, Ince, Beckham; Owen, Cole.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>AN EXCLUSIVE DAVID BECKHAM INTERVIEW</strong></p> <p>The only international footballer to have appeared on the front page of a national newspaper last weekend looking like a member of Take That circa 1992 is interviewed in this month's Observer Sport Monthly, which comes free with this weekend's Observer. You can also hang on every word at <a href=\"www.observer.co.uk\">www.observer.co.uk</a>.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>JIM LEIGHTON, MR LUCKY</strong></p> <p>Jim Leighton, the vaseline-smothered custodian, had many highlights in his unfeasibly long career. Sadly, no-one will ever remember them, as the lows - losing his place for the FA Cup final replay, dropping howlers that helped Scotland out of, not one, but two World Cups - are so much more memorable. So things looked to be taking an unexpected turn for the better when the SFA asked Leighton to travel with the Scottish Under-21 squad this week, despite having walked out on the senior squad only two years ago. But as Leighton would no doubt testify himself, appearances can be deceptive. </p> <p>\"I don't see it as a problem that [Leighton] is on this trip,\" Scotland coach Craig Brown said earlier today. \"He always played well for his country and I don't think anyone will be complaining.\" Which makes the fact that Brown was forced to sack Leighton this afternoon all the more unfortunate. Especially since it appears that Leighton was relieved of his duties because of his upcoming autobiography which is said, amongst other things, to have a pop at both Brown and the SFA.</p> <p>So it looks like another humiliation for Leighton who has packed his bags, left the Scottish camp and is off to do some radio commentary on Scotland's World Cup qualifier with San Marino instead. The Fiver wishes Leighton the best of luck, although if he intends to have a refreshing drink while carrying out his duties tomorrow, we'd advise staying as far away as he can from the electrical equipment.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'll be backing the English and hope that my former Arsenal team-mates and the rest of [Kelvin Koogan's side] are triumphant. On the Dutch side we have a long history of intense rivalry with Germany\" - Marc Overmars shows that one-eyed nationalism isn't restricted to these noble isles.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>A BHOY NAMED SUE</strong></p> <p>Last weekend, the Fiver opened a book on who would sue Paolo Di Canio first for remarks made in his snappily-titled autobiography Paolo Di Canio. You could get 5/1 on Ron Atkinson, who was called \"a crazy man\", and twos on David \"cretin\" James, the \"moron\". Meanwhile, odds-on favourite was team-mate Nigel Winterburn, who was referred to as \"silly\". With a well-balanced book, the Fiver was confident of making a tidy profit, especially when a Scottish-Canadian bloke wearing a false moustache and glasses stupidly risked \u00a3500 on 10,000/1 outsider Fergus McCann. But sure enough</p> <p>\"I am taking Paolo Di Canio to task over his recent false and damaging remarks,\" the former Celtic chief executive quipped today, after the former Bhoy accused him of breaking his word. \"Legal papers will be served. In a real world we are all accountable for our words and actions, a lesson Mr Di Canio is about to learn. It is important that individuals such as di Canio are not allowed to get away with misleading the public and particularly the Celtic support. I also have a personal obligation to defend my reputation.\" He does sound rather determined, doesn't he?</p> <p>At this stage, exactly what Mr McCann has taken umbrage with is anybody's guess. But the following rant suggests it could be about unreasonable contract negotiations. \"I wish I had taken this action some years ago and exposed Di Canio and Pierre van Hooijdonk for the disreputable way they abused Celtic\", McCann claimed. \"Both individuals signed detailed binding contracts approved by their agents and were delighted to do so, then later - having had their careers greatly enhanced by playing for Celtic - sought to make false claims against myself and the club.\" In fact, so convinced are we that this is the source of McCann's pique, we've placed a hefty bet accordingly.

      "bodyText": "THE FINAL COUNTDOWN So here we are at last. The day before England take on Germany in the final match at the twin towers of the home of football of Wembley, the national stadium. But, strangely, the Fiver does not feel too excited this afternoon. Rather there's a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the air, almost as if we've spent the entire week poring over every last tendon tweak before a game which is likely to be a tedious replay of a fixture we got worked up about only a couple of months ago. Must be something we ate. Anyway, for one last time, here we go. Kelvin Koogan, England coach, is very excited ahead of tomorrow's crucial crunch clash with the Bosch. Even the withdrawal of Liverpool's Steven Gerrard this afternoon with a recurrence of a groin injury hasn't fazed him. \"It's disappointing for him as it's happened before,\" Koog said. \"But it's probably better to happen in training than after five or ten minutes of the match.\" Too right, and Koog's got loads of other players to choice from anyway. \"With the players I have got I think we are covered double and treble in most positions,\" he said. Please God, don't let it be Paul Ince. A practical example of Koogan's first law aside, the England meistermind refrained from naming his team and surprisingly chose instead to concentrate on the historical significance of the match. \"I have told the 11 players who I have picked, they know this is the opportunity to be part of something special,\" he said. \"Until we lay the ghost of 1966 everyone is going to talk about Moore, Hurst, Peters, Bobby Charlton. But they can do something about that.\" But after a whole hour pondering the subject, the Fiver still isn't sure what. England XI (probable): Seaman; G Neville, Adams, Keown, Le Saux; Barmby, Scholes, Ince, Beckham; Owen, Cole. * * * * * * * * * * * * * AN EXCLUSIVE DAVID BECKHAM INTERVIEW The only international footballer to have appeared on the front page of a national newspaper last weekend looking like a member of Take That circa 1992 is interviewed in this month's Observer Sport Monthly, which comes free with this weekend's Observer. You can also hang on every word at www.observer.co.uk. * * * * * * * * * * * * * JIM LEIGHTON, MR LUCKY Jim Leighton, the vaseline-smothered custodian, had many highlights in his unfeasibly long career. Sadly, no-one will ever remember them, as the lows - losing his place for the FA Cup final replay, dropping howlers that helped Scotland out of, not one, but two World Cups - are so much more memorable. So things looked to be taking an unexpected turn for the better when the SFA asked Leighton to travel with the Scottish Under-21 squad this week, despite having walked out on the senior squad only two years ago. But as Leighton would no doubt testify himself, appearances can be deceptive. \"I don't see it as a problem that [Leighton] is on this trip,\" Scotland coach Craig Brown said earlier today. \"He always played well for his country and I don't think anyone will be complaining.\" Which makes the fact that Brown was forced to sack Leighton this afternoon all the more unfortunate. Especially since it appears that Leighton was relieved of his duties because of his upcoming autobiography which is said, amongst other things, to have a pop at both Brown and the SFA. So it looks like another humiliation for Leighton who has packed his bags, left the Scottish camp and is off to do some radio commentary on Scotland's World Cup qualifier with San Marino instead. The Fiver wishes Leighton the best of luck, although if he intends to have a refreshing drink while carrying out his duties tomorrow, we'd advise staying as far away as he can from the electrical equipment. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'll be backing the English and hope that my former Arsenal team-mates and the rest of [Kelvin Koogan's side] are triumphant. On the Dutch side we have a long history of intense rivalry with Germany\" - Marc Overmars shows that one-eyed nationalism isn't restricted to these noble isles. * * * * * * * * * * * * * A BHOY NAMED SUE Last weekend, the Fiver opened a book on who would sue Paolo Di Canio first for remarks made in his snappily-titled autobiography Paolo Di Canio. You could get 5/1 on Ron Atkinson, who was called \"a crazy man\", and twos on David \"cretin\" James, the \"moron\". Meanwhile, odds-on favourite was team-mate Nigel Winterburn, who was referred to as \"silly\". With a well-balanced book, the Fiver was confident of making a tidy profit, especially when a Scottish-Canadian bloke wearing a false moustache and glasses stupidly risked \u00a3500 on 10,000/1 outsider Fergus McCann. But sure enough \"I am taking Paolo Di Canio to task over his recent false and damaging remarks,\" the former Celtic chief executive quipped today, after the former Bhoy accused him of breaking his word. \"Legal papers will be served. In a real world we are all accountable for our words and actions, a lesson Mr Di Canio is about to learn. It is important that individuals such as di Canio are not allowed to get away with misleading the public and particularly the Celtic support. I also have a personal obligation to defend my reputation.\" He does sound rather determined, doesn't he? At this stage, exactly what Mr McCann has taken umbrage with is anybody's guess. But the following rant suggests it could be about unreasonable contract negotiations. \"I wish I had taken this action some years ago and exposed Di Canio and Pierre van Hooijdonk for the disreputable way they abused Celtic\", McCann claimed. \"Both individuals signed detailed binding contracts approved by their agents and were delighted to do so, then later - having had their careers greatly enhanced by playing for Celtic - sought to make false claims against myself and the club.\" In fact, so convinced are we that this is the source of McCann's pique, we've placed a hefty bet accordingly. But seeing we've just had to pawn our last pair of trousers, we don't necessarily advise you to follow suit. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea have made a \u00a33m bid for Deportivo La Coruna's Yugoslav international midfielder Savisa Jokanovic, according to Spanish sports daily AS. Lazio striker Marcelo Salas could move to Internazionale in a deal worth \u00a315m. Planet Football claims \"the deal could see Croatian defender Dario Simic moving in the opposite direction\". Aston Villa are believed to have offered Sheffield Wednesday \u00a31m for striker Gilles de Bilde. Blackburn midfielder Billy McKinlay - a target for Aberdeen, Hearts and Motherwell - is a target for two as-yet-unnamed English clubs, according to his agent. \"There has been interest from two English clubs,\" said John Viola, \"but unless Real Madrid come in with a six-year deal, Billy will take his time before making his mind up.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira believes one of the reasons he has problems with English referees may be because he is black. \"Am I a target because I'm a world champion?\" he asked French paper Le Parisien. \"Is it because I'm a foreigner in England? Or simply because I'm black? I don't want to be naive, I know racism will still be present even after the year 2000.\" Brad Friedel - currently being kept out of the Liverpool first team by in-form Sander Westerveld - has joined Bundesliga side Energie Cottbus on trial. Gerry Taggart has passed a fitness test on his groin injury and will play for Northern Ireland against Denmark in tomorrow's World Cup Qualifier at Windsor Park. Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson has been named the Bank of Scotland Manager of the Month. John Toshack has been appointed manager of St Etienne. Nottingham Forest have signed Ben Olsen, part of the US Olympic team, on a three-month loan. Former Heaven 17 pop star Martyn Ware has called upon Sheffield Wednesday chairman Howard Culley to resign to allow a group of rich fans to take over the Owls. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 4: Just William and Ffion (4.25am) Absolutely nothing to do with football but worth watching for the bit where William Hague basically admits to drink-driving.

When you made your handbag choice on the strength of: a) size - could it hold a kitchen sink? b) longevity - would it hold up to the kitchen sink? c) aesthetics - did it go with your clothes, did you actually like it? </p> <p>Over the past 15 years, handbag buyers have swapped personal needs and taste for status. Rather than wear their hearts on their sleeves, women today are choosing a power bag. </p> <p>Italians understand this notion very well. They should - they invented it. At Corso Como 10, Milan's most influential fashion store, handbags are displayed with reverence, like works of art, on low glass tables and the fashion elite quietly coos over supple leathers and hand-stitched finishes. The \"it's-not-what-you-know-it's-who-you-know\" philosophy translates very nicely into Italian bag-buying. Get ahead, get a handbag. The right handbag with the right name on it. You could almost forget about clothes. </p> <p>Reigning supreme over our taste in accessories stands Prada. Stick your hand up right now, Miuccia. You are responsible for turning us all into handbag junkies. As far back as the late 80s, we swooned for gilt-trimmed Chanel lookalikes; then there were the little black nylon backpacks complete with the Prada triangle of authenticity; and when the rest of the world caught on you went the exclusive route with gorgeous limited editions that got us crashing into Prada stores across the globe. </p> <p>The lesser-known face of Prada is Patrizio Bertelli, Miuccia's husband. They first met at a trade fair, at which Miuccia accused him of ripping off her bag designs (which she later admitted were very good), and they have since turned Muiccia's grandfather's musty luggage label into a multi-million-pound super-brand. </p> <p>Following Prada's success, they bought 75% of the Jil Sander label and 51% of Helmut Lang, both of which have produced very elegant handbags this season. At Corso Como 10, an entire table is given over to Lang's petite satin and patent leather envelope bags. Bertelli's influence? Perhaps, because he knows better than anyone how to manipulate us buyers - to give us what we want when we don't even know what it is. This season it was the doctor's bag, which sold almost as quickly as it was copied by the high street. Come spring, a predicted sell-out is the black nappa leather rectangular handbag with an extra wide khaki strap, short enough so the bag can sit elegantly and securely on the wrist. </p> <p>Hot on Prada's stiletto heels comes Gucci. What Prada gains in fashion kudos, Gucci makes up for in sexiness. Since becoming design director in 1994, Tom Ford has driven the company to the fashion front with a strict regime that presses all our lust buttons at once. The shop interiors, the ad campaigns, the catwalk presentations, the models' hair and make-up, the clothes themselves are all designed to scream sex. Once that association was secure, it was only a matter of time before we started buying the bags. </p> <p>This season, the most desirable Gucci bag is a golden envelope with a lion's head clasp. In spring, the overall trend moves towards a military look with elegant silver cases hanging from wide leather straps. Worldwide turnover at Gucci stands at $2.2b and the company is currently being fought over by two big French groups, LVMH and Pinault-Printemps-Redoute. Everybody, it would appear, wants to grab a bit of the Gucci magic. </p> <p>Which leads us neatly to Fendi, another Italian powerhouse, which only a year ago transferred 51% of its capital to a venture equally owned by LVMH and Prada. But to be fair, Fendi were fighting for space in your wardrobe already. </p> <p>Since 1965, Karl Lagerfeld has fused his creative genius with the expert craftsmanship of the family-run company set up in 1925. It enjoyed great success in the 70s with its luxurious ready-to-wear collections and the Fendi handbag took off when Lagerfeld helped to define 80s logo excess with the birth of the Fendi double F logo. </p> <p>But the giant step forward came in the late 90s with the advent of its patisserie-inspired bags (baguette, croissant) which immediately became collectors' items. This season's return to an unabashed flaunting of wealth suits Lagerfeld down to the ground. His most sought-after handbag is an updated version of the baguette in flash gold sequins. It is a Fendi handbag that remains true to its roots, unapologetic in its extravagance. </p> <p>In a much quieter way, luxury leather label Bottega Veneta has slipped into our consciousness with a range of handbags that has a different association - underground cool. How do you get instant street cred? With a collection designed by ex-St Martins student Giles Deacon and UK stylist Katie Grand (formerly with Alexander McQueen at Givenchy). </p> <p>After showing two collections in New York and masterminding a sophisticated ad campaign, Bottega Veneta have become something of a fashion insider's secret. Their definitive woven nappa bags sold out this season before half the fashionistas had a chance to snap them up. Get down there early for next season's sure-fire hit - a white woven envelope sprayed with multicoloured graffiti. </p> <p>Tod's are also relative newcomers to the handbag war. Just three short years ago, Diego Della Valle, son of the founder of the company, introduced a limited range of handbags to his already highly successful Tod's shoe line. The D bag, with instantly identifiable D-shaped straps, found its way on to the shoulders of Hillary Clinton, the late Princess Diana and Cindy Crawford. Since then, Tod's have formed a loyal following among the LA celeb brigade. But with Tod's it's not just about celeb endorsement. Della Valle prides himself on the quality and longevity of his goods. \"Sharon Stone might get the customer to buy initially,\" he has said, \"but unless the handbag lives up to the expectation, unless it is practical and hardwearing, then the customer won't come back. Seventy per cent of our customers are regular clients.\" </p> <p>So if you want what Calista Flockhart has got, check out the next American awards ceremony. You can bet she'll be holding one of Tod's minuscule sequined sacks with silver hoop handles. Make sure you get on the three-month waiting list early.</p>",

The offer was firmly rejected by United, which is believed to have told them to double the sum. </p> <p>United's hand, though, will be weakened by a note pub lished by its City advisers, Merrill Lynch, yesterday which put a value on the newspapers of between \u00a374m and \u00a3105m. The newspapers had revenues of just under \u00a3200m. </p> <p>The Barclays are understood to hope that Mr Randall, a former Sunday Times executive, would become editor at the Express if they could agree a price with United.

      "bodyText": "The Barclay brothers have approached the Sunday Business editor Jeff Randall in the hope of persuading him to take the Daily Express helm if they succeed in their bid to buy the paper from Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. The millionaire brothers approached Lord Hollick early last month with an offer of \u00a375m for the Daily Express, the Sunday Express and Daily Star. The offer was firmly rejected by United, which is believed to have told them to double the sum. United's hand, though, will be weakened by a note pub lished by its City advisers, Merrill Lynch, yesterday which put a value on the newspapers of between \u00a374m and \u00a3105m. The newspapers had revenues of just under \u00a3200m. The Barclays are understood to hope that Mr Randall, a former Sunday Times executive, would become editor at the Express if they could agree a price with United. Mr Randall has made a success of Sunday Business, also owned by the Barclays, and is contracted to stay at the title at least until next February. Rosie Boycott, current editor of the Daily Express, has been running the title for the past two and a half years and has engaged in the task of wrenching it to the left. Sales of the daily are just above 1m a day. One executive close to the Barclays' empire said that there was still a wide margin between them and Lord Hollick. The source claimed internal Express figures were \"horrendous\" and suggested the newspapers were barely profitable. \"They [the Barclays] will pay what it costs to buy them but are not going to pay what they are not worth,\" said the source. A senior Express source said that face-to-face discussions were held early last month between United and the would-be buyers. None of the parties involved would comment.",

People from the country's poorest postcodes (Egbaston, Birmingham, B14 for example), stand less than a one in ten chance of getting to university, according to statistics compiled by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. But at least eight out of ten people who live in the richest areas (King's Heath Birmingham B15 for example) are destined to become future graduates. </p> <p>The fairness of admissions procedures in elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge has become a big political issue since the Laura Spence affair erupted earlier this year. But this surely pales into insignificance compared with the fact that thousands of people still don't get to university at all. </p> <p>\"The big issue is surely that there are whole swathes of the population who are in social conditions which mean that they are highly unlikely to get near a university - top one or otherwise,\" said Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy at HEFCE. \"We need to devote most of our efforts to addressing this inequity. What university they go to is a secondary question.\"</p> <p>Just by raising participation rates to universities from the poorest areas to the national average, would generate an extra 100,000 university students. But there needs to be a sea change in school performance and society as a whole for this to happen. But would the government be genuinely willing to pay for these extra student places, if the deep educational divide across the country's postcodes is ever addressed?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The most dramatic figures published today by university funding chiefs in the latest set of academic performance statistics concern neither Oxford nor Cambridge, or the numbers of state schools students admitted to elite academic institutions. The statistics expose a gaping divide in educational prospects of people from the country's poorest and richest neighbourhoods. People from the country's poorest postcodes (Egbaston, Birmingham, B14 for example), stand less than a one in ten chance of getting to university, according to statistics compiled by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. But at least eight out of ten people who live in the richest areas (King's Heath Birmingham B15 for example) are destined to become future graduates. The fairness of admissions procedures in elite universities such as Oxford and Cambridge has become a big political issue since the Laura Spence affair erupted earlier this year. But this surely pales into insignificance compared with the fact that thousands of people still don't get to university at all. \"The big issue is surely that there are whole swathes of the population who are in social conditions which mean that they are highly unlikely to get near a university - top one or otherwise,\" said Bahram Bekhradnia, head of policy at HEFCE. \"We need to devote most of our efforts to addressing this inequity. What university they go to is a secondary question.\" Just by raising participation rates to universities from the poorest areas to the national average, would generate an extra 100,000 university students. But there needs to be a sea change in school performance and society as a whole for this to happen. But would the government be genuinely willing to pay for these extra student places, if the deep educational divide across the country's postcodes is ever addressed?",

Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, travelled to Belgrade conveying congratulations from Russian President Vladimir Putin to Mr Kostunica, the opposition leader being hailed by Western heads and even Yugoslav state media as the \"president-elect.\" Mr Kostunica's legitimacy was underlined as the European Union invited him to the EU-Balkans summit in Zagreb, Croatia, on November 24, according to French officials. In another move signalling the overthrow of the old order, former supporters of the disgraced former president, Slobodan Milosevic, in the republic of Montenegro declared their loyalty to the new president. Mr Milosevic, who presided over a disastrous dismemberment of Yugoslavia, was swept out of power in exuberant mass demonstrations in Belgrade yesterday.

Adrian Prangnell and John Yore were arrested in Montenegro in August with a Canadian colleague. Mr Cook welcomed the overthrow of Mr Milosevic, saying that sanctions against Yugoslavia could be lifted on Monday when the European parliament next meets.

Let us hope this is indeed the first day of liberation of the people of Serbia from President Milosevic.\" In Belgrade, jubilant crowds roamed the streets early this morning, celebrating the end of 13 years of Mr Milosevic's rule. Fears persist that there could be counterattacks by remnants of the discredited regime. Through the night, tens of thousands danced and sang in celebration of the seizure of Yugoslavia's parliament and other key symbols of the Milosevic regime. All state-owned media were working normally, broadcasting or publishing apologies for their past support for Mr Milosevic. Serb television occasionally flashed its logo during broadcasts, with the slogan: \"This is the new free Serbian television.\" State-owned or formerly pro-Milosevic dailies issued special editions reflecting the change in their editorial policies. Politika featured a front-page photograph of Mr Kostunica, his arm raised triumphantly in the air over a headline: \"Serbia on the road to democracy\".",

However, friends of his have this week admitted he's now taken things too far by stripping down to the short and curlies - something he appears to have plenty of - for the sake of the Daily Star's \"MegaStar\" campaign. The poster features a nude - and rather flushed - Mr Brown covering (just) his modesty with a board advertising the site. Mark Cranmer, chief executive at Starcom Motive and a dear friend of his, said: \"Kevin has a long history of exhibiting himself. He's done ads promoting gambling, alcohol and now blatant sex. I feel he should have asked for his legs to be retouched, though, because he seems to be suffering from the skinny legs/far gut syndrome that comes to all men as they get older. I love Kevin, but he is mad.\" Even one of Kevin's co-founders is advising people to turn a blind eye to the stunt. \"I wouldn't look at it if I were you - you might find it offensive,\" he said. You're not wrong, Duncan.</p> <p><strong>Caught out on a techie point</strong><br> Programmers panning TV shows? Geeks up in arms about TV stars? What the heck is going on? Anyone would think the BBC had made a show about a dot.com start-up. TV audiences may be unimpressed by This Life 2, the one set in a new media start-up and called Attachments, but those whose lives BBC2 is trying to mimic are even more unimpressed. True, World Productions may have done some homework, but those finicky techies are taking umbrage at any slight faux pas - such as transferring files by throwing floppy disks across the office and talking about downloads and demos as a revenue model. Those that haven't vented their spleen already are invited to do so at Everyonehatesattachments.com. But be careful, these hardcore new media types don't take prisoners. </p> <p><strong>Invaluable sentiment</strong><br> Granada Media chairman Charles Allen began his first address to troops of his newly acquired United News &amp; Media by declaring how much his company values programme-makers. Not such a surprising sentiment, you'd imagine, coming from the boss of a company with a significant TV production arm - but the jaws of senior United TV execs hit the floor all the same. Apparently the only word they were used to hearing from former boss Clive Hollick in the same sentence as \"value\" is \"shareholder\".</p> <p><strong>When the caption fits...</strong><br>Sir Christopher Bland got a morning grilling from the delectable Sophie Raworth (isn't Jeremy looking fetching too with his matching purple tie?) on BBC breakfast news today. Pity about the caption though, which read: \"Fiona Mannion: mini owner\".</p> <p><strong>expectingcomplaints.com</strong><br>Monkey apologies for allowing a cad like Danny Kelly to blatantly pull the wool over readers' eyes in Monday's edition of the Media Guardian. Asked about his favourite websites, Kelly named expectingrain.com and woolyrockstars.com. Pernickety readers, i.e. those that go through absolutely everything with a fine-tooth comb, immediately pointed out that the latter website does not in fact exist. More importantly neither the .com or the .co.uk domain names for Woolyrockstars have been registered. Was Kelly making a mockery of us all or was he merely pointing out a new market niche? Kelly says neither: \"I'm very much afraid this thing does exist. The url, however, is woollyrockers.com. Check it out!!\" Duh! Monkey did and fell in love with the Bee Gees doll. Could Kelly have created a monster? </p> <p><strong>Minutes matter</strong><br>What's this? The BBC's famously impartial news reporting standards slipping over its own 10pm news bulletin announcement? The Monkey has got its paws on an internal email from BBC Online producer James Thornet that was sent round after the news broke to BBC online hacks out in the sticks. He draws his colleagues' attention to the fact that the switch to 10pm means the regional bulletin tacked on at the end of the proper, grown-up news will be extended to a massive six-and-a-half minutes. \"We must put this story at the top of online news stories asap,\" says the excitable Thornett. Is he worried viewers in the regions wouldn't notice the difference otherwise? </p> <p><strong>Only slimline warriors need apply</strong><br> Monkey has received an email from Rainbow network, home of Xena fans (see proud to portly, below), anxious to set the record straight. \"Firstly, the generosity of Channel 5 in offering Rainbow a box of T-shirts goes without saying - we were delighted to receive them, and we had loads of entrants to the competition in which they were the prize. On opening the eagerly awaited box of goodies, however, we could tell straight away that there was no way, with the best will in the world, anyone other than a small teenager or large Teddy bear was going to be able to get into them.<br> We closed the competition as images of irate readers struggling to get an arm in a size 6 garment sprang to mind. As Tamara, the Xena co-ordinator at Channel 5, said: 'Annoyingly our merchandise person fits these and didn't consider the more womanly figure, ie me.' We're with you, Tamara! <br>Some lucky winners did decide to hang on to their prizes, although we still have 35 or so here in the Rainbow office. Send us your address and we'll happily send you one.\" Monkey is unsure about being compared to a large teddy bear, but may well have to take up Rainbow's kind offer in the spirit of investigation. </p> <p><br> <br> <strong>Sticky gimmicks</strong><br> Monkey was amused to discover an overflowing pot of honey in the post today. The honey pot subsequently attacked all surrounding computers and made everything in the office sticky. Eugh. The penny finally dropped when Monkey found the attached (and at this point very sticky) note, saying that eBay was stickier than QXL. Point taken. But did it really have to destroy my workspace to tell me that? <br> <br> <strong>Clash of the dot.com giants</strong><br> Plunging dot.com stock prices are nothing new, but the long-term ramifications are starting to impact heavily on those big boys we call Amazon and eBay. Rumours have started to surface about a mooted merger between the two e-commerce giants, which have both been rocked by the recent downturn in dot.com fortunes. A tie-up would make sense, particularly for Amazon, which is struggling to convince investors of its long-term earnings. Perhaps it should take a leaf from eBay's gimmick book and start sending out plants and pots of bottled Amazon river water to prove to investors that Amazon can make things grow. Just a (naff) suggestion. <br> <br> <strong>Proud to portly</strong><br> Channel 5 kindly sent 50 of its finest Xena, Warrior Princess T-shirts to the gay and lesbian website Rainbownetwork.com for a competition giveaway, on account of the pigtailed one being terribly popular with the target audience. Channel 5 was staggered, then, when Rainbow very apologetically sent them all back. It seems the T-shirts are of the cropped belly button-baring variety and, after a bit of market research in the office, Rainbow discovered they were too petite for its users. Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. <br> <br> <strong>Bad taste sensation</strong><br> GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say? Answers on the back of a cornflakes box, please.<br> <br> <strong> Rings a bell</strong><br> Readers of the Scotsman who also take Sunday Business may be suffering from a sense of d\u00e9ja vu. A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman. Other Sunday Business hacks should expect further doppelganger copy to start appearing north of the border under increasingly ludicrous invented bylines. </p> <p> <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it1s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match on Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now! <br> <br> <strong>What's in a suffix?</strong><br> Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick.<br> <br> Email the Media Monkey at <a href=\"mailto:monkey@mediatheguardian.com\">Monkey@mediatheguardian.com</a><br></p>",

Seems a shame to let them go to waste, so Monkey is happy to try to squeeze into one to show support. Bad taste sensation GMTV managing director Christopher Stoddart is so concerned about reports of tasteless office banter that he has issued an email to all staff reminding them of the company's equal opportunities policy. In a carefully worded memo, he also reminded staff of the company's grievance procedure and told them that they mustn't feel frightened of whistle-blowing on their bosses. \"From time to time we will be drawing your attention to important company policies which we all need to follow. Our equal opportunities policy is particularly important because its scope is both on-screen and off-screen,\" he wrote. \"Should any employee have a complaint under this policy [or for any other reason] he should feel free to raise the matter.\" He continued: \"If it concerns their line manager, then they may wish to consult personnel.\" Who on earth has prompted this and what on earth did he or she say? Answers on the back of a cornflakes box, please. Rings a bell Readers of the Scotsman who also take Sunday Business may be suffering from a sense of d\u00e9ja vu. A few weeks ago top Sunday Biz hack Richard Northedge wrote a coruscating profile of some suit or other doing something fantastically important in the City. Two weeks later a frighteningly similar article (exactly the same except for two small amendments) appeared in the Scotsman's revamped business section, albeit under a different byline. Perhaps Northedge should sue for plagiarism. But then the ed-in-chief of the pink Sunday is one Andrew Neil, who is also in charge of the Scotsman. Other Sunday Business hacks should expect further doppelganger copy to start appearing north of the border under increasingly ludicrous invented bylines. Not quite all over for Wembley commentator The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it1s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match on Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now! What's in a suffix? Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick. Email the Media Monkey at Monkey@mediatheguardian.com",

The 60-year-old, currently on police bail for charges of perverting the course of justice has admitted he has been offered four film roles, including three from Hollywood. He is currently appearing in a play called The Accused. The disgraced peer who describes himself as \"a simple entertainer\" reveals: \"My agent is dealing with the offers. I would like to be in a film, possibly in America. I enjoy acting immensely. I concentrate on it fully. I am literally not thinking about anything else at the moment.\"</p> <p>\u0095 It seems the <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Coen,+Joel\">Coen</a> <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Coen,+Ethan \">brothers</a> will now not be appearing in Stephen Soderbergh's adaptation of the Rat Pack film <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,150546,00.html\">Ocean's Eleven</a>. According to <a href=\" http://www.aintitcool.com/\">Ain't It Cool</a>, twin actors Mark and Michael Polish (recently seen playing conjoined twins in the strange Twin Falls Idaho) have been bought in to take over the roles of the hapless getaway drivers from original cast members Owen and Luke Wilson</p> <p>\u0095 Star Wars honcho <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Lucas,+George \">George Lucas</a> is supposedly getting fed up with leaks from the set of Episode II appearing on the internet. Lucas is reportedly furious after photos, storyboards and shoot schedules (some fished from rubbish bins) have appeared on fan websites. He has demanded that security be stepped up on set. </p> <p><a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hewitt,+Jennifer+Love\">Jennifer Love Hewitt</a> is to star as the devil in Alec Baldwin's directorial debut <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,4029,377728,00.html\">The Devil and Daniel Webster</a>. She will star alongside Anthony Hopkins and Baldwin in a story about a struggling writer who makes a pact with the devil to become a bestselling author. \"It's definitely a different role than I normally take,but the character is amazing and incredibly well-written,\" Hewitt told the Hollywood Reporter. \"It is a more grown-up role for me. And I want to show that I am growing as a woman and human being and am ready to take on more adult roles.\"</p> <p>Controversial director <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Stanley,+Richard+(I)\">Richard Stanley</a> is steadily returning to the public eye with the announcement of his third film since being unceremoniously booted off The Island of Doctor Moreau in 1996. According to <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com\">Screendaily</a> South African-born Stanley is to return to the sci-fi genre of his 1990 debut Hardware, in a $9m futurist thriller called In A Season Of Soft Rains. Set in the UK after a revolution, the story focuses on an American assassin planning to kill a young English prince who is hiding out in Wales.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Former Conservative party vice-chairman Lord Archer has been approached by Hollywood to become a film star. The 60-year-old, currently on police bail for charges of perverting the course of justice has admitted he has been offered four film roles, including three from Hollywood. He is currently appearing in a play called The Accused. The disgraced peer who describes himself as \"a simple entertainer\" reveals: \"My agent is dealing with the offers. I would like to be in a film, possibly in America. I enjoy acting immensely. I concentrate on it fully. I am literally not thinking about anything else at the moment.\" \u0095 It seems the Coen brothers will now not be appearing in Stephen Soderbergh's adaptation of the Rat Pack film Ocean's Eleven. According to Ain't It Cool, twin actors Mark and Michael Polish (recently seen playing conjoined twins in the strange Twin Falls Idaho) have been bought in to take over the roles of the hapless getaway drivers from original cast members Owen and Luke Wilson \u0095 Star Wars honcho George Lucas is supposedly getting fed up with leaks from the set of Episode II appearing on the internet. Lucas is reportedly furious after photos, storyboards and shoot schedules (some fished from rubbish bins) have appeared on fan websites. He has demanded that security be stepped up on set. Jennifer Love Hewitt is to star as the devil in Alec Baldwin's directorial debut The Devil and Daniel Webster. She will star alongside Anthony Hopkins and Baldwin in a story about a struggling writer who makes a pact with the devil to become a bestselling author. \"It's definitely a different role than I normally take,but the character is amazing and incredibly well-written,\" Hewitt told the Hollywood Reporter. \"It is a more grown-up role for me. And I want to show that I am growing as a woman and human being and am ready to take on more adult roles.\" Controversial director Richard Stanley is steadily returning to the public eye with the announcement of his third film since being unceremoniously booted off The Island of Doctor Moreau in 1996. According to Screendaily South African-born Stanley is to return to the sci-fi genre of his 1990 debut Hardware, in a $9m futurist thriller called In A Season Of Soft Rains. Set in the UK after a revolution, the story focuses on an American assassin planning to kill a young English prince who is hiding out in Wales. Shooting is due to begin early next year. .",

Pascal Feindouno, Bordeaux's 19-year-old striker, is a target for Fulham boss Jean Tigana. Everton could get Liverpool back for nicking off with Nick Barmby - sort of. Steve Staunton, who has been released by Gerard Houllier on a free transfer, is a target for Walter Smith, according to Planet Football. Wage negotiations between Tottenham Hotspur and Stephen Carr have broken down, Planet Football claims. Manchester United are just one of the many Premiership clubs interested in the 24-year-old right-back. Teamtalk reports that Everton plan to move from Goodison Park - a new 55,000 capacity ground with retractable roof on the King's Dock has been mooted.",

      "body": "<p>When I close my eyes at night, I can see rhinestones. That's what Milan fashion week does to you, and the Versace show isn't even until tonight. The 80s revival that in London and New York was a timid pixie-booted creature, oversizedjersey dress slouching off one shoulder, has in Milan blossomed into an all-singing, all-dancing cabaret of the decade of excess, an homage to someone who is a totem of the era. In Milan, the 80s doesn't mean batwing sleeves or ra-ra skirts, it means Madonna. </p> <p>At times, this week has been like watching an extra-long MTV tribute to the Material Girl. It began last weekend at the Dolce &amp; Gabbana diffusion line D&amp;G, where Madonna's recent single, Music, was the soundtrack to the trademark naughty cheerleader looks; later the same day, the Versus diffusion line by Versace featured boned, underwired satin camisoles reminiscent of the famous Jean Paul Gaultier conical bra tops Madonna once wore. At Gucci, always a key show, the look had developed into sharply pointed bustier cocktail dresses in pink satin. Tom Ford cited Marilyn Monroe as an inspiration for the collection, which couldn't help but remind us of the video for Material Girl, in which Madonna dressed up as Monroe singing Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, in a shiny pink strapless gown and jewels. </p> <p>But Madonna worship only really works when done with humour. Explaining the Dolce &amp; Gabbana collection, which included customised, diamant\u00e9-studded Madonna tour T-shirts worn with lovingly ripped jewel-studded drainpipes, Stefano Gabbana proclaimed: \"Molto sexy. Madonna. Top models. Spaghetti westerns\" and then leant back and watched us faithfully write this down, visibly amused. He sees the madness, he is in on the joke. The difficulty with designers such as Roberto Cavalli and Anna Molinari, however, is that you can't help worrying that they are serious, that they truly believe all you need for spring is a leather bikini and a fur-trimmed turquoise leopardprint bolero cardigan with pom- poms at the shoulder. </p> <p>Madonna is also the link with another catwalk theme, the Wild West. There is a striking similarity between the styling of the sleeve cover to the Music single, with Madonna in stetson, full make-up and rhinestones, and the portraits of tight-denimed, hair-sprayed female rodeo stars by American photographer Lisa Eisner, which were exhibited at the Colette store in a recent Paris fashion week and seem to have made an impression on many designers. There were stetsons at Cavalli and D&amp;G rhinestone-studded chaps, fringed jackets and holster belts at Dolce &amp; Gabbana. </p> <p>The million-dollar question, of course, is do we want to wear any of this? At Gucci, the strapless, boned cocktail dresses were sexy but the wire corsets that sat beneath the models' little breasts like eggcups looked more orthopaedic than erotic. Satin trenchcoats in Klein blue and royal purple looked a little brash, but the new version of the puffball skirt, softly looped under and not puffy at all, was elegant. Dolce &amp; Gabbana revisited the styles that made them famous two decades ago: corset-laced seams on sexy black suits, dresses cut to reveal lace underwear, leopardprint shoulderpads visible through sheer blouses. The tight jeans, fitted motorcycle jackets and black mini-dresses were jaw-droppingly sexy. If only the 80s really had been this good. </p> <p>Roberto Cavalli is the king of maximalism. Plunging necklines and thigh-high splits, sequins and chiffon, python skin and diamant\u00e9 - and that was just one outfit. Where he developed one strong idea rather than piling 14 together, there were some beautiful dresses, such as a backless gown patterned like the wings of an exotic butterfly, with a low, looping hem. Blumarine by Anna Molinari is unashamedly girlie (its trademarks are leopardprint and florals) and this cutesy, 50s prom collection was no exception, with pleated skirts (everywhere this season) and sundresses (ditto) in mint and pink. Among the pastels was one perfect, jewel-bright jade green satin halter dress. There were more satin frocks at Versus, this time with a diagonal one-strap neckline as an alternative to the halter. </p> <p>Missoni was an upbeat show which played on the label's distinctive zigzags to create modern, bright graphic prints that fizzed on slinky halter dresses and mini-kimonos. The bags and wedge-heeled matching sandals were some of the most instantly desirable accessories of the season. The 80s touches came in the form of one-sleeved dresses, Chanel-style camellia brooches (also seen at Lawrence Steel and Armani) and ruched drainpipe trousers. Antonio Berardi took a leap from last season's flapper dresses to cropped jackets, buckled mini-skirts, culottes and dresses with bra-styled bodices. Much of this was a little hard-edged, but highlights included a filmy dress of palest pink silk trailing a feather boa of silk petals from one shoulder. </p> <p>Many designers refuse to be shoe-horned into the season's prevailing trend. Prada seemed intent on purging all glamour from its collections. Vests came in the simplest round-neck shapes, plain polo shirts were buttoned to the neck. </p> <p>At both his Emporio Armani and mainline shows, Giorgio Armani seemed almost to be trying to distract the audience from the clothes with the woeful play-acting and awkward faux-salsa dancing of the models. Of the Giorgio Armani collection, the designer said his ideal woman \"often dresses like a boy and she is never as erotic and sweet as when she acts the role of the nouvelle gar\u00e7on \"; the trousers with braces should have looked Deauville-esque, but reminded me too much of Some Like It Hot. Still, design talent like Armani's will always come through: both collections featured deliciously soft, fluttery, shadow-shaded dresses. </p> <p>Maxmara, with safari jackets and perfectly-cut trousers for day and Chinese-style chrysanthemum prints in jade green on champagne silk for evening, was unfalteringly elegant, as was Krizia's new Krizia Top collection. Designed by Alber Elbaz, previously of Yves Saint Laurent, Krizia Top had wearable, glamorous skirts and trouser suits in tobacco and coffee leather, suede and linen. Alessandro dell'Acqua showed a sophisticated collection with lots of green (a trend), chiffon (ditto) and sexy, long-legged, ribbon-trim trousers. Strenesse by Gabrielle Strehle was neat and pretty with tight floral prints and matching shoes (set to be huge next summer). Lawrence Steel, who recently designed Jennifer Aniston's wedding dress, didn't quite recapture the evocative sexiness of last season's 40s look: this collection was inspired by military spit and polish, and men's black tie, like a parody of an officers' ball. The bow ties looked a bit silly, frankly, but the sequined asymmetric mini-dresses and camisoles were beautiful. </p> <p>Narciso Rodriguez has been dubbed the new Calvin Klein: his clothes are whisper-quiet, easy and grown-up, with no showpieces or retro references. This show was all white shirts and black trousers - not just any, but the perfect white shirts and black trousers, mind you - with cognac-coloured leather skirts and bias-cut beaded black dresses. If I ever get to be a Material Girl, you can keep the diamonds - I'll have these, thanks very much.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The rumour, having been pinned to the page by William's pen like a butterfly to a cork, didn't come to the ears of some people, because they had other, darker things on their mind. </p> <p>Their rowboat slid through the hissing waters of the river Ankh, which closed behind it slowly. </p> <p>Two men were bent over the oars. The third sat in the pointy end. Occasionally he spoke. </p> <p>He said things like 'My nose itches.' </p> <p>'You'll just have to wait till we get there,' said one of the rowers. </p> <p>'You could let me out again. It really itches.' </p> <p>'We let you out when we stopped for supper.' </p> <p>'It didn't itch then.' </p> <p>The other rower said, 'Shall I hit him up alongside the -ing head with the -ing oar again, Mr Pin?' </p> <p>'Good idea, Mr Tulip.' </p> <p>There was a dull thump in the darkness. </p> <p>'Ow.' </p> <p>'Now no more fuss, friend, otherwise Mr Tulip will lose his temper.' </p> <p>'Too -ing right.' Then there was a sound like an industrial pump. </p> <p>'Hey, go easy on that stuff, why don't you?' </p> <p>'Ain't -ing killed me yet, Mr Pin.' </p> <p>The boat oozed to a halt alongside a tiny, little-used landing stage. The tall figure who had so recently been the focus of Mr Pin's attention was bundled ashore and hustled down an alley. </p> <p>A moment later there was the sound of a carriage rolling away into the night. </p> <p>It would seem quite impossible, on such a mucky night, that there could have been anyone to witness this scene. </p> <p>But there was. The universe requires everything to be observed, lest it cease to exist. </p> <p>A figure shuffled out from the shadows of the alley, close by. There was a smaller shape wobbling uncertainly by its side. </p> <p>Both of them watched the departing coach as it disappeared into the snow. </p> <p>The smaller of the two figures said, 'Well, well, well. There's a fing. Man all bundled up and hooded. An interesting fing, eh?' </p> <p>The taller figure nodded. It wore a huge old greatcoat several sizes too big, and a felt hat that had been reshaped by time and weather into a soft cone that overhung the wearer's head. </p> <p>'Scraplit,' it said. 'Thatch and trouser, a blewit the grawney man. I told 'im. I told 'im. Millennium hand and shrimp. Bugrit.' </p> <p>After a pause it reached into its pocket and produced a sausage, which it broke into two pieces. One bit disappeared under the hat, and the other was tossed to the smaller figure, who was doing most of the talking or, at least, most of the coherent talking. </p> <p>'Looks like a dirty deed to me,' said the smaller figure, which had four legs. </p> <p>The sausage was consumed in silence. Then the pair set off into the night again. </p> <p>In the same way that a pigeon can't walk without bobbing its head, the taller figure appeared unable to move without a sort of low-key, random mumbling: </p> <p>'I told 'em, I told 'em. Millennium hand and shrimp. I said, I said, I said. Oh, no. But they only run out, I told 'em. Sod 'em. Doorsteps. I said, I said, I said. Teeth. Wassa name of age, I said I told 'em, not my fault, matterofact, matterofact, stands to reason ...' </p> <p>The rumour did come to his ears later on, but by then he was part of it. </p> <p>As for Mr Pin and Mr Tulip, all that need be known about them at this point is that they are the kind of people who call you 'friend'. People like that aren't friendly. </p> <p>William opened his eyes. I've gone blind, he thought. </p> <p>Then he moved the blanket. </p> <p>And then the pain hit him. </p> <p>It was a sharp and insistent sort of pain, centred right over the eyes. He reached up gingerly. There seemed to be some bruising and what felt like a dent in the flesh, if not the bone. </p> <p>He sat up. He was in a sloping-ceilinged room. A bit of grubby snow crusted the bottom of a small window. Apart from the bed, which was just a mattress and blanket, the room was unfurnished. </p> <p>A thump shook the building. Dust drifted down from the ceiling. He got up, clutching at his forehead, and staggered to the door. It opened into a much larger room or, more accurately, a workshop. </p> <p>Another thump rattled his teeth. </p> <p>William tried to focus. </p> <p>The room was full of dwarfs, toiling over a couple of long benches. But at the far end several of them were clustered around something like a complex piece of weaving machinery. </p> <p>It went thump again. </p> <p>William rubbed his head. 'What's happening?' he said. </p> <p>The nearest dwarf looked up at him and nudged a colleague urgently. The nudge passed itself along the rows, and the room was suddenly filled wall to wall with a cautious silence. A dozen solemn dwarf faces looked hard at William. </p> <p>No one can look harder than a dwarf. Perhaps it's because there is only quite a small amount of face between the statutory round iron helmet and the beard. Dwarf expressions are more concentrated. </p> <p>'Um,' he said. 'Hello?' </p> <p>One of the dwarfs in front of the big machine was the first to unfreeze. </p> <p>'Back to work, lads,' he said, and came and looked William sternly in the groin. </p> <p>'You all right, your lordship?' he said. </p> <p>William winced. 'Um ... what happened?' he said. 'I, uh, remember seeing a cart, and then something hit ...' </p> <p>'It ran away from us,' said the dwarf. 'Load slipped, too. Sorry about that.' </p> <p>'What happened to Mr Dibbler?' </p> <p>The dwarf put his head on one side. ''The skinny man with the sausages?' he said. </p> <p>'That's right. Was he hurt?' </p> <p>'I don't think so,' said the dwarf carefully. 'He sold young Thunderaxe a sausage in a bun, I do know that.' </p> <p>William thought about this. Ankh-Morpork had many traps for the unwary newcomer. </p> <p>'Well, then, is Mr Thunderaxe all right?' he said. </p> <p>'Probably. He shouted under the door just now that he was feeling a lot better but would stay where he was for the time being,' said the dwarf. He reached under a bench and solemnly handed William a rectangle wrapped in grubby paper. </p> <p>'Yours, I think.' </p> <p>William unwrapped his wooden block. It was split right across where a wheel of the cart had run over it, and the writing had been smudged. He sighed. </p> <p>''scuse me,' said the dwarf, 'but what was it meant to be?' </p> <p>'It's a block prepared for a woodcut,' said William. He wondered how he could possibly explain the idea to a dwarf from outside the city. 'You know? Engraving? A... a sort of very nearly magical way of getting lots of copies of writing? I'm afraid I shall have to go and make another one now.' </p> <p>The dwarf gave him an odd look, and then took the block from him and turned it over and over in his hands. </p> <p>'You see,' said William, 'the engraver cuts away bits of-' </p> <p>'Have you still got the original?' said the dwarf. </p> <p>'Pardon?' </p> <p>'The original,' said the dwarf patiently. </p> <p>'Oh, yes.' William reached inside his jacket and produced it. </p> <p>'Can I borrow it for a moment?' </p> <p>'Well, all right, but I shall need it again to-' </p> <p>The dwarf scanned the letter a while, and then turned and hit the nearest dwarf a resounding boing on the helmet. </p> <p>'Ten point across three,' he said, handing him the paper. The struck dwarf nodded, and then its right hand moved quickly across the rack of little boxes, selecting things. </p> <p>'I ought to be getting back so I can-' William began. </p> <p>'This won't take long,' said the head dwarf. 'Just you step along this way, will you? This might be of interest to a man of letters such as yourself.' </p> <p>William followed him along the avenue of busy dwarfs to the machine, which had been thumping away steadily. </p> <p>'Oh. It's an engraving press,' said William vaguely. </p> <p>'This one's a bit different,' said the dwarf. 'We've... modified it.' He took a large sheet of paper off a pile by the press and gave it to William, who read: </p> <p> GUNILLA GOODMOUNTAIN &amp; CO. Re\u0083pectfully Solicit Work for their New WORD SMITHY A method of taking multiple impresfions the like of which Hath not hiterto been \u0083een. </p> <p> Rea\u0083onable rates. </p> <p> At the Sign of The Bucket, Gleam Street, off Treacle Mine Road, Ankh-Morpork.</p> <p>'What do you think?' said the dwarf shyly. </p> <p>'Are you Gunilla Goodmountain?' </p> <p>'Yes. What do you think?' </p> <p>'We-ell ... you've got the letters nice and regular, I must say,' said William. 'But I can't see what's so new about it. And you've spelled \"hitherto\" wrong. There should be another h after the first t. You'll have to cut it all out again unless you want people to laugh at you.' </p> <p>'Really?' said Goodmountain. He nudged one of his colleagues. </p> <p>'Just give me a ninety-six-point lower-case h, will you, Caslong? Thank you.' </p> <p>Goodmountain bent over the press, picked up a spanner and busied himself somewhere in the mechanical gloom. </p> <p>'You must have a really steady hand to get the letters so neat,' said William. He felt a bit sorry that he'd pointed out the mistake. Probably no one would have noticed in any case. Ankh-Morpork people considered that spelling was a sort of optional extra. They believed in it in the same way they believed in punctuation; it didn't matter where you put it so long as it was there. </p> <p>The dwarf finished whatever arcane activity he had been engaged in, dabbed with an inked pad at something inside the press, and got down. </p> <p>'I'm sure it won't' - thump - 'matter about the spelling,' said William. </p> <p>Goodmountain opened the press again and wordlessly handed William a damp sheet of paper. </p> <p>William read it. </p> <p>The extra h was in place. </p> <p>'How -?' he began. </p> <p>'This is a very nearly magical way of getting lots of copies quickly,' said Goodmountain. Another dwarf appeared at his elbow, holding a big metal rectangle. It was full of little metal letters, back to front. Goodmountain took it and gave William a big grin. </p> <p>'Want to make any changes before we go to press?' he said. 'Just say the word. A couple of dozen prints be enough?' </p> <p>'Oh dear,' said William. 'This is printing, isn't it...?' </p> <p>The Bucket was a tavern, of sorts. There was no passing trade. The street was if not a dead end then seriously wounded by the area's change in fortunes. Few businesses fronted on to it. It consisted mainly of the back ends of yards and warehouses. No one even remembered why it was called Gleam Street. There was nothing very sparkling about it. </p> <p>Besides, calling a tavern the Bucket was not a decision destined to feature in Great Marketing Decisions of History. Its owner was Mr Cheese, who was thin, dry and only smiled when he heard news of some serious murder. Traditionally he had sold short measure but, to make up for it, had short-changed as well. However, the pub had been taken over by the City Watch as the unofficial policemen's pub, because policemen like to drink in places where no one else goes and they don't have to be reminded that they are policemen. </p> <p>This had been a benefit in some ways. Not even licensed thieves tried to rob the Bucket now. Policemen didn't like their drinking disturbed. On the other hand, Mr Cheese had never found a bigger bunch of petty criminals than those wearing the Watch uniform. He saw more dud dollars and strange pieces of foreign currency cross his bar in the first month than he'd found in ten years in the business. It made you depressed, it really did. But some of the murder descriptions were quite funny. </p> <p>He made part of his living by renting out the rat's nest of old sheds and cellars that backed on to the pub. They tended to be occupied very temporarily by the kind of enthusiastic manufacturer who believed that what the world really, really needed today was an inflatable dartboard. </p> <p>But there was a crowd outside the Bucket now, reading one of the slightly misprinted posters that Goodmountain had nailed up on the door. Goodmountain followed William out and nailed up the corrected version. </p> <p>'Sorry about your head,' he said. 'Looks like we made a bit of an impression on you. Have this one on the house.' </p> <p>William skulked home, keeping in the shadows in case he met Mr Cripslock. But he folded his printed sheets into their envelopes and took them down to the Hubward Gate and gave them to the messengers, reflecting as he did so that he was doing this several days before he had expected to. </p> <p>The messengers gave him some very odd looks. </p> <p>He went back to his lodgings and had a look at himself in the mirror over the washbasin. A large R, printed in bruise colours, occupied a lot of his forehead. </p> <p>He stuck a bandage over it. </p> <p>And he still had eighteen more copies. As an afterthought, and feeling rather daring, he looked through his notes for the addresses of eighteen prominent citizens who could probably afford it, wrote a short covering letter to each one offering this service for... he thought for a while and then carefully wrote '$5'... and folded the free sheets into eighteen envelopes. Of course, he could always have asked Mr Cripslock to do more copies as well, but it had never seemed right. After the old boy had spent all day chipping out the words, asking him to sully his craftsmanship by making dozens of duplicates seemed disrespectful. But you didn't have to respect lumps of metal and machines. Machines weren't alive. </p> <p>That, really, was where the trouble was going to start. And there was going to be trouble. The dwarfs had seemed quite unconcerned when he'd told them how much of it there was going to be. </p> <p>The coach arrived at a large house in the city. A door was opened. A door was shut. Another door was knocked on. It was opened. It shut. The carriage pulled away. </p> <p>One ground-floor room was heavily curtained, and only the barest gleam of light filtered out. Only the faintest of noises filtered out, too, but any listener would have heard a murmur of conversation die down. Then a chair was knocked over and several people shouted, all at once.</p> <p>'That is him!' </p> <p>'It's a trick... isn't it?' </p> <p>'I'll be damned!' </p> <p>'If it is him, so are we all!' </p> <p>The hubbub died away. And then, very calmly, someone began to talk. </p> <p>'Good. Good. Take him away, gentlemen. Make him comfortable in the cellar.' </p> <p>There were footsteps. A door opened and closed. </p> <p>A more querulous voice said, 'We could simply replace-' </p> <p>'No, we could not. I understand that our guest is, fortunately, a man of rather low intelligence.' There was this about the first speaker's voice. It spoke as if disagreeing was not simply unthinkable but impossible. It was used to being in the company of listeners. </p> <p>'But he looks the spit and image-' </p> <p>'Yes. Astonishing, isn't it? Let us not overcomplicate matters, though. We are a bodyguard of lies, gentlemen. We are all that stands between the city and oblivion, so let us make this one chance work. Vetinari may be quite willing to see humans become a minority in their greatest city, but frankly his death by assassination would be... unfortunate. It would cause turmoil, and turmoil is hard to steer. And we all know that there are people who take too much of an interest. No. There is a third way. A gentle slide from one condition to another.' </p> <p>'And what will happen to our new friend?' </p> <p>'Oh, our employees are known to be men of resource, gentlemen. I'm sure they know how to deal with a man whose face no longer fits, eh?' </p> <p>There was laughter.</p>",

Their rowboat slid through the hissing waters of the river Ankh, which closed behind it slowly. Two men were bent over the oars. The third sat in the pointy end. Occasionally he spoke. He said things like 'My nose itches.' 'You'll just have to wait till we get there,' said one of the rowers. 'You could let me out again. It really itches.' 'We let you out when we stopped for supper.' 'It didn't itch then.' The other rower said, 'Shall I hit him up alongside the -ing head with the -ing oar again, Mr Pin?' 'Good idea, Mr Tulip.'

'Hey, go easy on that stuff, why don't you?' 'Ain't -ing killed me yet, Mr Pin.' The boat oozed to a halt alongside a tiny, little-used landing stage. The tall figure who had so recently been the focus of Mr Pin's attention was bundled ashore and hustled down an alley. A moment later there was the sound of a carriage rolling away into the night. It would seem quite impossible, on such a mucky night, that there could have been anyone to witness this scene. But there was. The universe requires everything to be observed, lest it cease to exist. A figure shuffled out from the shadows of the alley, close by. There was a smaller shape wobbling uncertainly by its side. Both of them watched the departing coach as it disappeared into the snow. The smaller of the two figures said, 'Well, well, well. There's a fing. Man all bundled up and hooded. An interesting fing, eh?' The taller figure nodded. It wore a huge old greatcoat several sizes too big, and a felt hat that had been reshaped by time and weather into a soft cone that overhung the wearer's head. 'Scraplit,' it said. 'Thatch and trouser, a blewit the grawney man. I told 'im. I told 'im. Millennium hand and shrimp. Bugrit.' After a pause it reached into its pocket and produced a sausage, which it broke into two pieces. One bit disappeared under the hat, and the other was tossed to the smaller figure, who was doing most of the talking or, at least, most of the coherent talking. 'Looks like a dirty deed to me,' said the smaller figure, which had four legs. The sausage was consumed in silence. Then the pair set off into the night again. In the same way that a pigeon can't walk without bobbing its head, the taller figure appeared unable to move without a sort of low-key, random mumbling: 'I told 'em, I told 'em. Millennium hand and shrimp. I said, I said, I said. Oh, no. But they only run out, I told 'em. Sod 'em. Doorsteps. I said, I said, I said. Teeth.

It would cause turmoil, and turmoil is hard to steer. And we all know that there are people who take too much of an interest. No. There is a third way. A gentle slide from one condition to another.' 'And what will happen to our new friend?' 'Oh, our employees are known to be men of resource, gentlemen. I'm sure they know how to deal with a man whose face no longer fits, eh?' There was laughter.",

I wouldn't say, if I could.' </p> <p>'Can you?' </p> <p>'No!' </p> <p>'Ah-ha!' </p> <p> * * * </p> <p> It came to the ears of the Night Watch of the city guard, as they did gate duty at ten o'clock on an icy night. Gate duty in Ankh-Morpork was not taxing. It consisted mainly of waving through anything that wanted to go through, although traffic was minimal in the dark and freezing fog. </p> <p>They hunched in the shelter of the gate arch, sharing one damp cigarette. </p> <p>'You can't turn something into something else,' said Corporal Nobbs.'The Alchemists have been trying it for years.' </p> <p>'They can gen'rally turn a house into a hole in the ground,' said Sergeant Colon. 'That's what I'm talking about,' said Corporal Nobbs. 'Can't be done. It's all to do with ... elements. An alchemist told me. Everything's made up of elements, right? Earth, Water, Air, Fire and... sunnink. Well-known fact. Everything's got 'em all mixed up just right.' </p> <p>He stamped his feet in an effort to get some warmth into them. </p> <p>'If it was possible to turn lead into gold, everyone'd be doing it,' he said. </p> <p>'Wizards could do it,' said Sergeant Colon. </p> <p>'Oh, well, magic,' said Nobby dismissively. </p> <p>A large cart rumbled out of the yellow clouds and entered the arch, splashing Colon as it wobbled through one of the puddles that were such a feature of Ankh-Morpork's highways. </p> <p>'Bloody dwarfs,' he said, as it continued on into the city. But he didn't say it too loudly. </p> <p>'There were a lot of them pushing that cart,' said Corporal Nobbs reflectively. It lurched slowly round a corner and was lost to view. </p> <p>'Prob'ly all that gold,' said Colon. </p> <p>'Hah. Yeah. That'd be it, then.' </p> <p>And the rumour came to the ears of William de Worde, and in a sense it stopped there, because he dutifully wrote it down. </p> <p>It was his job. Lady Margolotta of Uberwald sent him five dollars a month to do it. The Dowager Duchess of Quirm also sent him five dollars. So did King Verence of Lancre, and a few other Ramtop notables. So did the Seriph of Al Khali, although in his case the payment was half a cartload of figs, twice a year. </p> <p>All in all, he considered, he was on to a good thing. All he had to do was write one letter very carefully, trace it backwards on to a piece of boxwood provided for him by Mr Cripslock the engraver in the Street of Cunning Artificers, and then pay Mr Cripslock twenty dollars to carefully remove the wood that wasn't letters and make five impressions on sheets of paper. </p> <p>Of course, it had to be done thoughtfully, with spaces left after 'To my Noble Client the', and so on, which he had to fill in later, but even deducting expenses it still left him the best part of thirty dollars for little more than one day's work a month. </p> <p>A young man without too many responsibilities could live modestly in Ankh-Morpork on thirty or forty dollars a month; he always sold the figs, because although it was possible to live on figs you soon wished you didn't. </p> <p>And there were always additional sums to be picked up here and there. The world of letters was a closed book - mysterious papery object - to many of Ankh-Morpork's citizens, but if they ever did need to commit things to paper quite a few of them walked up the creaky stairs past the sign 'William de Worde: Things Written Down'. </p> <p>Dwarfs, for example. Dwarfs were always coming to seek work in the city, and the first thing they did was send a letter home saying how well they were doing. This was such a predictable occurrence, even if the dwarf in question was so far down on his luck that he'd been forced to eat his helmet, that William had Mr Cripslock produce several dozen stock letters which needed only a few spaces filled in to be perfectly acceptable. </p> <p>Fond dwarf parents all over the mountains treasured letters which looked something like this: </p> <p>Dear [Mume &amp; Dad],</p> <p>Well, I arrived here all right and I am staying, at [109 Cockbill Street The Shades Ankh-Morpk].

Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha ...' </p> <p>William pulled another sheet of paper towards him, sharpened a fresh quill, stared at the wall for a moment and then wrote as follows: </p> <p>And finally, on the lighter Side, it is being said that the Dwarfs can Turn Lead into Gold, though no one knows whence the rumour comes, and Dwarfs going about their lawful occa\u0083ions in the City are hailed with cries such as, e.g., 'Hollah, short stuff, let's see you make some Gold then!' although only Newcomers do this because all here know what happens if you call a Dwarf 'short stuff', viz., you are Dead. </p> <p>Yr. obdt. servant, William de Worde</p> <p>He always liked to finish his letters on a happy note. </p> <p>He fetched a sheet of boxwood, lit another candle and laid the letter face down on the wood. A quick rub with the back of a spoon transferred the ink, and thirty dollars and enough figs to make you really ill were as good as in the bank. </p> <p>He'd drop it into Mr Cripslock tonight, pick up the copies after a leisurely lunch tomorrow, and with any luck should have them all away by the middle of the week. </p> <p>William put on his coat, wrapped the wood block carefully in some waxed paper and stepped out into the freezing night. </p> <p>The world is made up of four elements: Earth, Air, Fire and Water. This is a fact well known even to Corporal Nobbs. It's also wrong. There's a fifth element, and generally it's called Surprise. </p> <p>For example, the dwarfs found out how to turn lead into gold by doing it the hard way. The difference between that and the easy way is that the hard way works. </p> <p>The dwarfs dwarfhandled their overloaded, creaking cart along the street, peering ahead in fog. Ice formed on the cart and hung from their beards. </p> <p>All it needed was one frozen puddle. </p> <p>Good old Dame Fortune. You can depend on her. </p> <p>The fog closed in, making every light a dim glow and muffling all sounds. It was clear to Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs that no barbarian horde would be including the invasion of Ankh-Morpork in their travel plans for this evening. The watchmen didn't blame them. </p> <p>They closed the gates. This was not the ominous activity that it might appear, since the keys had been lost long ago and latecomers usually threw gravel at the windows of the houses built on top of the wall until they found a friend to lift the bar. It was assumed that foreign invaders wouldn't know which windows to throw gravel at. </p> <p>Then the two watchmen trailed through the slush and muck to the Water Gate, by which the river Ankh had the good fortune to enter the city. The water was invisible in the dark, but the occasional ghostly shape of an ice floe drifted past below the parapet. </p> <p>'Hang on,' said Nobby, as they laid hands on the windlass of the portcullis. 'There's someone down there.' </p> <p>'In the river?' said Colon. </p> <p>He listened. There was the creak of an oar, far below. </p> <p>Sergeant Colon cupped his hands around his mouth and issued the traditional policeman's cry of challenge. </p> <p>'Oi! You!' </p> <p>For a moment there was no sound but the wind and the gurgling of the water. Then a voice said: 'Yes?' </p> <p>'Are you invading the city or what?' </p> <p>There was another pause. Then: </p> <p>'What?' </p> <p>'What what?' said Colon, raising the stakes. </p> <p>'What were the other options?' </p> <p>'Don't mess me about ... Are you, down there in the boat, invading this city?' </p> <p>'No.' </p> <p>'Fair enough,' said Colon, who on a night like this would happily take someone's word for it. 'Get a move on, then, 'cos we're going to drop the gate.' </p> <p>After a while the splash of the oars resumed and disappeared downriver. </p> <p>'You reckon that was enough, just askin' 'em?' said Nobby. </p> <p>'Well, they ought to know,' said Colon. </p> <p>'Yeah, but-' </p> <p>'It was a tiny little rowin' boat, Nobby. Of course, if you want to go all the way down to them nice icy steps on the jetty-' </p> <p>'No, sarge.' </p> <p>'Then let's get back to the Watch House, all right?' </p> <p>William turned up his collar as he hurried towards Cripslock the engraver. The usually busy streets were deserted. Only those people with the most pressing business were out of doors. It was turning out to be a very nasty winter indeed, a gazpacho of freezing fog, snow and Ankh-Morpork's ever-present, ever-rolling smog. </p> <p>His eye was caught by a little pool of light by the Watchmakers' Guild. A small hunched figure was outlined in the glow. </p> <p>He wandered over. </p> <p>A hopeless sort of voice said, 'Hot sausages? Inna bun?' </p> <p>'Mr Dibbler?' said William. </p> <p>Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Ankh-Morpork's most enterprisingly unsuccessful businessman, peered at William over the top of his portable sausage-cooking tray. Snowflakes hissed in the congealing fat. </p> <p>William sighed. 'You're out late, Mr Dibbler,' he said politely. </p> <p>'Ah, Mr Word. Times is hard in the hot sausage trade,' said Dibbler. </p> <p>'Can't make both ends meat, eh?' said William. He couldn't have stopped himself for a hundred dollars and a shipload of figs. </p> <p>'Definitely in a period of slump in the comestibles market,' said Dibbler, too sunk in gloom to notice. 'Don't seem to find anyone ready to buy a sausage in a bun these days.' </p> <p>William looked down at the tray. If Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler was selling hot sausages, it was a sure sign that one of his more ambitious enterprises had gone wahoonie-shaped yet again. Selling hot sausages from a tray was by way of being the ground state of Dibbler's existence, from which he constantly sought to extricate himself and back to which he constantly returned when his latest venture went all runny. Which was a shame, because Dibbler was an extremely good hot sausage salesman. He had to be, given the nature of his sausages. </p> <p>'I should have got a proper education like you,' said Dibbler despondently. 'A nice job indoors with no heavy lifting. I could have found my nitch, if'n I'd have got a good education.' </p> <p>'Nitch?' </p> <p>'One of the wizards told me about 'em,' said Dibbler. 'Everything's got a nitch. You know. Like: where they ought to be. What they was cut out for?' </p> <p>William nodded. He was good with words. 'Niche?' he said. </p> <p>'One of them things, yes.' Dibbler sighed. 'I missed out on the semaphore. Just didn't see it coming. Next thing you know, everyone's got a clacks company. Big money. Too rich for my blood. I could've done all right with the Fung Shooey, though. Sheer bloody bad luck there.' </p> <p>'I've certainly felt better with my chair in a different position,' said William. That advice had cost him two dollars, along with an injunction to keep the lid down on the privy so that the Dragon of Unhappiness wouldn't fly up his bottom. </p> <p>'You were my first customer and I thank you,' said Dibbler. 'I was all set up, I'd got the Dibbler wind-chimes and the Dibbler mirrors, it was gravy all the way - I mean, everything was positioned for maximum harmony, and then... smack. Bad karma plops on me once more.' </p> <p>'It was a week before Mr Passmore was able to walk again, though,' said William. The case of Dibbler's second customer had been very useful for his news letter, which rather made up for the two dollars. </p> <p>'I wasn't to know there really is a Dragon of Unhappiness,' said Dibbler. </p> <p>'I don't think there was until you convinced him that one exists,' said William. </p> <p>Dibbler brightened a little. 'Ah, well, say what you like, I've always been good at selling ideas. Can I convince you of the idea that a sausage in a bun is what you desire at this time?' </p> <p>'Actually, I've really got to get this along to-' William began, and then said, 'Did you just hear someone shout?' </p> <p>'I've got some cold pork pies, too, somewhere,' said Dibbler, ferreting in his tray. 'I can give you a convincingly bargain price on\u0097' </p> <p>'I'm sure I heard something,' said William. </p> <p>Dibbler cocked an ear. 'Sort of like a rumbling?' he said. </p> <p>'Yes.' </p> <p>They stared into the slowly rolling clouds that filled Broad Way. </p> <p>Which became, quite suddenly, a huge tarpaulin-covered cart, moving unstoppably and very fast... </p> <p>And the last thing William remembered, before something flew out of the night and smacked him between the eyes, was someone shouting, 'Stop the press!' </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,378502,00.html\">Continues</a></p>",

Then the two watchmen trailed through the slush and muck to the Water Gate, by which the river Ankh had the good fortune to enter the city. The water was invisible in the dark, but the occasional ghostly shape of an ice floe drifted past below the parapet. 'Hang on,' said Nobby, as they laid hands on the windlass of the portcullis. 'There's someone down there.' 'In the river?' said Colon. He listened. There was the creak of an oar, far below. Sergeant Colon cupped his hands around his mouth and issued the traditional policeman's cry of challenge. 'Oi! You!' For a moment there was no sound but the wind and the gurgling of the water. Then a voice said: 'Yes?' 'Are you invading the city or what?' There was another pause. Then: 'What?' 'What what?' said Colon, raising the stakes. 'What were the other options?' 'Don't mess me about ... Are you, down there in the boat, invading this city?' 'No.' 'Fair enough,' said Colon, who on a night like this would happily take someone's word for it. 'Get a move on, then, 'cos we're going to drop the gate.' After a while the splash of the oars resumed and disappeared downriver. 'You reckon that was enough, just askin' 'em?' said Nobby. 'Well, they ought to know,' said Colon. 'Yeah, but-' 'It was a tiny little rowin' boat, Nobby. Of course, if you want to go all the way down to them nice icy steps on the jetty-' 'No, sarge.' 'Then let's get back to the Watch House, all right?' William turned up his collar as he hurried towards Cripslock the engraver. The usually busy streets were deserted. Only those people with the most pressing business were out of doors. It was turning out to be a very nasty winter indeed, a gazpacho of freezing fog, snow and Ankh-Morpork's ever-present, ever-rolling smog. His eye was caught by a little pool of light by the Watchmakers' Guild. A small hunched figure was outlined in the glow. He wandered over. A hopeless sort of voice said, 'Hot sausages? Inna bun?' 'Mr Dibbler?' said William. Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Ankh-Morpork's most enterprisingly unsuccessful businessman, peered at William over the top of his portable sausage-cooking tray. Snowflakes hissed in the congealing fat. William sighed. 'You're out late, Mr Dibbler,' he said politely. 'Ah, Mr Word. Times is hard in the hot sausage trade,' said Dibbler. 'Can't make both ends meat, eh?' said William. He couldn't have stopped himself for a hundred dollars and a shipload of figs. 'Definitely in a period of slump in the comestibles market,' said Dibbler, too sunk in gloom to notice. 'Don't seem to find anyone ready to buy a sausage in a bun these days.' William looked down at the tray. If Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler was selling hot sausages, it was a sure sign that one of his more ambitious enterprises had gone wahoonie-shaped yet again. Selling hot sausages from a tray was by way of being the ground state of Dibbler's existence, from which he constantly sought to extricate himself and back to which he constantly returned when his latest venture went all runny. Which was a shame, because Dibbler was an extremely good hot sausage salesman. He had to be, given the nature of his sausages. 'I should have got a proper education like you,' said Dibbler despondently. 'A nice job indoors with no heavy lifting. I could have found my nitch, if'n I'd have got a good education.' 'Nitch?' 'One of the wizards told me about 'em,' said Dibbler. 'Everything's got a nitch. You know. Like: where they ought to be. What they was cut out for?' William nodded. He was good with words. 'Niche?' he said. 'One of them things, yes.' Dibbler sighed. 'I missed out on the semaphore. Just didn't see it coming. Next thing you know, everyone's got a clacks company. Big money. Too rich for my blood. I could've done all right with the Fung Shooey, though. Sheer bloody bad luck there.' 'I've certainly felt better with my chair in a different position,' said William. That advice had cost him two dollars, along with an injunction to keep the lid down on the privy so that the Dragon of Unhappiness wouldn't fly up his bottom. 'You were my first customer and I thank you,' said Dibbler. 'I was all set up, I'd got the Dibbler wind-chimes and the Dibbler mirrors, it was gravy all the way - I mean, everything was positioned for maximum harmony, and then... smack. Bad karma plops on me once more.' 'It was a week before Mr Passmore was able to walk again, though,' said William. The case of Dibbler's second customer had been very useful for his news letter, which rather made up for the two dollars. 'I wasn't to know there really is a Dragon of Unhappiness,' said Dibbler. 'I don't think there was until you convinced him that one exists,' said William. Dibbler brightened a little. 'Ah, well, say what you like, I've always been good at selling ideas. Can I convince you of the idea that a sausage in a bun is what you desire at this time?' 'Actually, I've really got to get this along to-' William began, and then said, 'Did you just hear someone shout?' 'I've got some cold pork pies, too, somewhere,' said Dibbler, ferreting in his tray. 'I can give you a convincingly bargain price on\u0097' 'I'm sure I heard something,' said William. Dibbler cocked an ear. 'Sort of like a rumbling?' he said. 'Yes.' They stared into the slowly rolling clouds that filled Broad Way. Which became, quite suddenly, a huge tarpaulin-covered cart, moving unstoppably and very fast... And the last thing William remembered, before something flew out of the night and smacked him between the eyes, was someone shouting, 'Stop the press!' Continues",

Its judges unveiled a shortlist of six which included three little-known authors, one of them a woman first novelist. Their three novels have sold a total of only 553 copies in Britain. But now Trezza Azzopardi, Michael Collins and Brian O'Doherty can expect this figure to rise at least tenfold thanks to the pulling power of the Booker. The more eminent novelists they beat include Muriel Spark, Doris Lessing, JG Ballard, Julian Barnes, Fay Weldon, AS Byatt, Michael Ondaatje and Zadie Smith, whose novel White Teeth was shortlisted for the Orange prize. Yesterday morning copies of their work were being snapped up at Waterstone's bookshop, in Hampstead, north London, as customers heard about the shortlist by grapevine. \"I am so glad the judges have gone so deep into the pile of novels and found these titles,\" said the manager, Francis Cleverdon. \"They are all very well thought of.\" O'Doherty's The Deposition of Daniel McGreevy, his second novel, is published by a tiny London press, Arcadia. The other two are Azzopardi's The Hiding Place (Picador) and Collins's third novel The Keepers of Truth (Phoenix House). On the shortlist, these relatively obscure authors stand beside two of the literary book world's bigger established names: the 1989 Booker winner Kashuo Ishiguro, who is in the final six for When We Were Orphans (Faber and Faber), and the Canadian author Margaret Atwood, listed for the fourth time with The Blind Assassin (Bloomsbury). The sixth author, Matthew Kneale, who has won two other awards for novels, wins a place for The English Passengers (Hamish Hamilton). Julian Barnes's Love, Etc, a sequel to his 1992 story Talking It Over, almost made the shortlist, according to one person close to the judging. So did White Teeth. But another source disputed these claims. Insiders tipped Atwood and Ishiguro as likeliest to win the prize, to be announced on November 7. Azzopardi was named a potential outside candidate for her picture of the 1960s Maltese underworld in Cardiff. Atwood is early favourite at 2-1, the bookmakers William Hill said yesterday. Second favourite is Ishiguro at 5-2, Kneale is 4-1, Collins 9-2, and O'Doherty 5-1, with Azzopardi the outsider.

Only with the disappearance of Old Man Lawton and the determination of the local cops to fix murder on his son, Ronny, does the dust of the place get under Bill's nails. When We Were Orphans Kazuo Ishiguro, 46 Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a316.99 Odds 7/2 Ishiguro's first novel for five years, following the complex and intractable The Unconsoled, is an unusual detective story set in 1930s England.

      "bodyText": "French internet service provider Wanadoo has boosted customer revenues and increased its user base, but the good news sent its balance sheet into the red. The company posted a first-half pre-tax loss of E66.9m (\u00a340m), against an operating profit of E39.6m for the whole of 1999. Wanadoo was reporting its first set of results since being spun off from parent company France Telecom in July. Wanadoo said revenues were E456.3m, at the bottom end of analysts' expectations, and the number of active users had risen from 1.38m in June to 1.5m in September. A six-month E110.1m investment spree appears to have paid off, however, as the average revenue per customer rose from E8.4 for the whole of 1999 to E9.4. \"Bearing in mind the continued growth of internet activities and the seasonal nature of the directories business, the group should be able to achieve second-half turnover significantly above that of the first half,\" Wanadoo said.",

In an effort to ensure the deal was cleared the two firms are said to have offered to dispose of Virgin Records and Chappell Music Publishing, but only after Brussels' strict deadline for remedies had passed. Eric Nicoli, chairman of EMI, said: \"The withdrawal of our applications allows additional time to reassess regulators' concerns and pursue solutions in Europe and the US. We have been, and will continue to be, flexible in responding to the EC's concerns. \"We continue to believe that a venture with Warner Music Group can create substantial value for our shareholders and benefit our artists, consumers and employees by bringing together two companies with complementary strengths.\" The EC acknowledged that that the tentative concessions proposed over recent days had \"improved substantially the initial remedies\", but said EMI and Warner had simply run out of time. \"It's very dangerous to leave your undertakings to the last minute because it leaves very little time for the EC to consider them,\" said EC spokeswoman Amelia Torres.",

It opens with me in my leotard on my bike with the cake - cue titles and music - and then there's a great close-up of yours truly licking her lips while Simply the Best! blares out in the background. </p> <p>I then get off my exercise bike and jog around all four sides of the open-plan kitchen, touching each wall in turn, until I get to my fridge. A fridge, I tell the viewer, is the very best place you can think of to perform those vital body-toning exercises that are so necessary for a shapely \"tum\". I then lean against the fridge with my right arm outstretched, slowly moving my left foot through an arc of 180 degrees, then I turn around and do the same thing with the other arm and foot. After a couple of minutes of this exercise, I take a well-earned breather and open the fridge to fetch out all the ingredients for one of my all-time favourite starters: Timbale of Smoked Salmon with a Low Fat Cottage Cheese on a Bed of Lean Bacon Potato Cake with Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut Custard. </p> <p>With all the ingredients laid out before me on my stainless steel work-surface, I tell viewers that this is a brilliant \"bluffer's\" dish that takes only a matter of minutes to prepare - yet is guaranteed to impress even your most standoffish guests! Then, before embarking on the preparation, I remind everyone that the absolute best way to lose weight in the kitchen is to engage in a tightly controlled regime of aerobics while doing all the cooking. For instance, it's easy as pie to perform my stretch-and-stretch/stretch-and-stretch exercises with your knees and lower thighs while preparing the Extra Thick Chocolate-and-Peanut-Custard with your upper body. </p> <p>With the starter all ready and looking simply out-of-this-world, I jog backwards (excellent for slicing pounds off the buttock area, would you believe!) to the fridge and move straight on to the main course - Boudin of Guinea Fowl Stuffed with Veal Sweetbreads with Mussel and Saffron Sauce on a Coulis of Low Fat Blackcurrant Yoghurt. But before I embark on the preparation, I am filmed strapping on my rollerblades, switching my CD to full-blast and then -between the stirring and the pummelling, the slicing and the frying - letting it all hang out and shedding inches off the old waistline by boogying on down to the all-time greatest hits of Macy Gray. </p> <p>To complete the meal, I prepare a simple Butterscotch Mousse with Vanilla Ice-Cream and Low-Fat Cr\u00e8me Fraiche on a tray on the floor while performing 10 old fashioned press-ups. Smashing! And so - with all the hard work completed - I get myself in the mood for my dinner party by slipping into a favourite frock and pouring myself a rewarding glass of champagne, accompanied by some wholemeal taco chips and an amazing marzipan and cream-cheese dip. </p> <p> The lovely thing about the TV programme is that it doesn't just show the food preparation \u00e0 la Delia - it also lets the viewers participate in the dinner party itself (though not literally, obviously: I haven't got a clue who half of them are!). In that first programme, my guests include arts supremo Chris Smith, the inspirational Anita Roddick, the ever vivacious Eve Pollard and top lyricist Tim Rice (who, he tells me, is fighting a losing battle with his waistline!). </p> <p>Talk flowed. As usual, it began with cooking (\"Don't tell anybody - promise!\" said Eve as we dug into our Smoked Salmon Timbales, \"but I've just picked up the most brilliant way of stuffing an artichoke with that marvellous new Tesco's wholemeal blancmange\"), before moving on to dieting (\"I've lost just over three pounds in six weeks on my splendid new break-dancing machine,\" revealed Chris.

      "bodyText": "NTL has become the fourth digital television provider to choose Liberate's TV platform software for its enhanced TV services, in what is seen as a further blow to Microsoft. The Liberate software will be used to connect NTL's UK digital cable services with those of recently acquired Cable &amp; Wireless, which already use the technology. NTL follows cable companies Telewest, UPC and Spanish Ono, which have recently chosen Liberate's technology over Microsoft's. The move is likely to infuritate Microsoft, which has has invested nearly $10bn to gain a foothold in the interactive TV operating system market. It has investments in all three companies - $2.6bn in Telewest, $353m in UPC and $500m in NTL, but its efforts to move into interactive TV have been beset by problems. Microsoft's software was not delivered on time to UPC for its Amsterdam roll-out.",

There was an increase in tension with the Palestinian release of Hamas prisoners in Gaza, and a call by Hamas for a day of protest today. The Haram al-Sharif, which houses the golden Dome of the Rock, has been the centre of the protests, which were triggered by the visit there last Thursday by the hardline leader of the Likud opposition party, Ariel Sharon. Mr Arafat returned to Gaza from his meetings with Mrs Albright and Mr Mubarak accusing Israel of using excessive force and renewing his demand for an inquiry. \"We will insist . . . on the necessity and the importance of convening an international fact-finding panel on what our people have suffered from massacres and severe aggression that violate international law,\" he said. After flying home from Paris, Mr Barak met military chiefs, and cabinet ministers to try to plot a way out of the disaster. He reaffirmed his pledge to the peace process, jeopardised by the week of violence. Mrs Albright has invited both negotiating teams to Washington next week to try to restart the talks.

Exactly what the 15-nation club will look like five years from now is, however, less certain - and different countries have different ideas about how it should evolve. Today in Warsaw, in front of an audience of Polish politicians and business leaders, the prime minister staked out his vision for a 21st century European Union. It is a vision which he hopes will resurrect the bloc's dismal popularity back home and ensure that Britain is not sidelined by the likes of France and Germany. The stakes are high and time is running out. A wave of crucial reforms that will alter the balance of power in Brussels are just months away, and 12 mostly eastern European countries including Poland are knocking at the EU's door and will not take no for an answer. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and the French president, Jacques Chirac, have had their turn at doing the vision thing and now it's Blair's chance. But his words are likely to rattle the European Commission's faltering president, Romano Prodi, who wants to extend the powers of his own unelected institution. And they will irk Chirac, who effectively advocates a Europe led by Paris and Berlin. For Blair is effectively signalling that the rules of the EU game - for so long set in stone and unchallenged - are about to change, and that Britain will struggle to ensure that the new rules are to its liking. The European commission's days as a motor of integration, guiding nation states closer and closer to the holy grail of a United States of Europe with power concentrated in Brussels are numbered, Blair said today. The prime minister believes it is democratic and elected governments who should be in control, and there should be checks and balances to ensure that institutions in Brussels do not exceed their authority. As such, he is proposing a second chamber for the European Union made up of prominent MPs from national parliaments to keep an eye on the EC and the sometimes erratic European parliament. French ambitions of a \"pioneer group\" of more federalist-minded countries - streaking ahead of the rest and wielding far more power as a result - are also kicked into touch. Blair has no problem with countries stepping up EU cooperation in areas such as defence, justice and home affairs. But that must not, he insists, be at the expense of others. \"Deepening can include enhanced cooperation, but that does not mean exclusive bodies. We must preserve equality in the EU, including for the new arrivals,\" says one government official.

And he is the first European leader to come out and say he wants the first new EU members to be signed up by a certain date - in this case 2004. This is astute. For it comes at a time when the timetable for enlargement seems to be slipping and aspirant countries are growing increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of negotiations. Blair is therefore making friends in eastern Europe and ensuring that the project - which is seen as vital to Britain's own interests - remains on track. For a bigger club is likely to be a far more democratic club and that will make profound reform of the EU a crushing inevitability. That should ensure that the growing gap between Europe's ruled and its rulers closes and should make the European project far easier to sell back at home. Blair said today in Warsaw: \"The problems Europe's citizens have with Europe arise when Europe's priorities are not theirs.\" Romano Prodi must be livid: a more democratic Europe will see his own powers diminished. But change is coming. And whatever the outcome of the debate which is about to erupt, Europe will never be the same again.",

      "body": "<p>Prague saw a dawning realisation by those responsible for international finance as much as by those on the streets that globalisation has perverse consequences. Free market theory has been put into practice but the result has been the opposite of what was promised. </p> <p>The moves, not least under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, towards the liberalisation of commerce is built on the theory of comparative advantage. Everyone is supposed to benefit. The international institutions on parade in Prague and Seattle promulgated an edict of international competitiveness. It promised growth would ensure wealth for all. Yet comparative advantage - \"do what you do best, and trade for the rest\" - ignores differences in power between traders and producers. The result has been a rise in the gap between rich and poor. The latest World Bank development report, source of the chart, shows average income in the richest 20 countries is 37 times the average in the poorest 20 - a gap that has doubled in the past 40 years. </p> <p>Comparative advantage assumed money would remain local. Since the 70s there has been an acceleration in the opposite direction, in pursuit of \"capital advantage\". This free flow of money internationally is supposed to ensure its efficient and rational use. Again the majority are supposed to be the winners. </p> <p>The 1997 Asian crisis made clear such global flows could have adverse effects. The \"tigers\" had used an astute mixture of domestic protectionism and export-led growth to become the only area in the south where widespread poverty reduction has been achieved. In east Asia, the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell from around 420m in 1987 to around 280m in 1998. </p> <p>After Seattle and Prague we need to think again. Globalisation needs to be replaced by \"localisation\", protecting and rebuilding local economies. Long-distance trade would be gradually reduced to supplying what could not come from within one country or region. Trade is conducted under rules which give preference to goods supplied in a way that benefits workers, the local community and the environment. The global flow of technology and information would be encouraged only when and where it can strengthen local economies. </p> <p>Globalisation's advocates want to maximise trade and money flows for profit. From this comes a clear set of policies and trade rules. Localisation reverses this by discriminating in favour of the local (which may embrace a regional grouping of states. At the heart of localisation is a rejection of today's environmentally and socially damaging subservience to international competitiveness. If control of the economy falls to communities and nations social cohesion could be built, poverty and inequality reduced, livelihoods improved. </p> <p>This does not mean a return to overpowering state control. But new rules would have to be enacted to stop imports of goods and services that could be produced locally. Industries will have to be located in the local community if they are to win permission to sell in it. Flows of money would be controlled. Competition policy would discriminate in favour of local production. New resource and pollution taxes would be levied to pay for the transition. </p> <p>Today's global casino consists of traders gambling on minute market fluctuations. In 1980, the daily average of foreign trading was $80bn. Today, more than $1,500bn flows daily across international borders. Some 90% of capital flows are speculative (based on movements in currency and interest rates) rather than productive. Democratic control over such capital is the key to providing the money for governments and communities to rebuild. As well as a Tobin-type tax on international capital transactions to curb currency speculators, broader re-regulation of finance capital will be required. This would include physical controls on capital flows, taxes on short-term speculative transactions, tightening of easy credit that allows speculators to multiply the size of their \"bets\" way beyond the cash required to cover them. Also essential is a widespread and coordinated attack on corporate tax evasion, including offshore banking centres. </p> <p>Any one country proposing such controls on its own would immediately be punished by the markets. However, a regional grouping of powerful states such as the European Union would be a secure and lucrative enough market to ensure that those who control money would not dare to leave the safety and security afforded by such a bloc. This pattern would then be attempted globally. </p> <p>In a small way the process has already begun. Last year two Green members of the European parliament, Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert, were elected from the UK on a platform that included such localisation. Ms Lucas, as a member of the parliament's trade committee, has initiated discussions about the Europe-wide changes needed to achieve such an end goal. </p> <p>Politically, the 20th century was a battle between left and right.

      "bodyText": "Prague saw a dawning realisation by those responsible for international finance as much as by those on the streets that globalisation has perverse consequences. Free market theory has been put into practice but the result has been the opposite of what was promised. The moves, not least under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, towards the liberalisation of commerce is built on the theory of comparative advantage. Everyone is supposed to benefit. The international institutions on parade in Prague and Seattle promulgated an edict of international competitiveness. It promised growth would ensure wealth for all. Yet comparative advantage - \"do what you do best, and trade for the rest\" - ignores differences in power between traders and producers. The result has been a rise in the gap between rich and poor. The latest World Bank development report, source of the chart, shows average income in the richest 20 countries is 37 times the average in the poorest 20 - a gap that has doubled in the past 40 years. Comparative advantage assumed money would remain local. Since the 70s there has been an acceleration in the opposite direction, in pursuit of \"capital advantage\". This free flow of money internationally is supposed to ensure its efficient and rational use. Again the majority are supposed to be the winners. The 1997 Asian crisis made clear such global flows could have adverse effects. The \"tigers\" had used an astute mixture of domestic protectionism and export-led growth to become the only area in the south where widespread poverty reduction has been achieved. In east Asia, the number of people living on less than $1 a day fell from around 420m in 1987 to around 280m in 1998. After Seattle and Prague we need to think again. Globalisation needs to be replaced by \"localisation\", protecting and rebuilding local economies. Long-distance trade would be gradually reduced to supplying what could not come from within one country or region. Trade is conducted under rules which give preference to goods supplied in a way that benefits workers, the local community and the environment. The global flow of technology and information would be encouraged only when and where it can strengthen local economies. Globalisation's advocates want to maximise trade and money flows for profit. From this comes a clear set of policies and trade rules. Localisation reverses this by discriminating in favour of the local (which may embrace a regional grouping of states. At the heart of localisation is a rejection of today's environmentally and socially damaging subservience to international competitiveness. If control of the economy falls to communities and nations social cohesion could be built, poverty and inequality reduced, livelihoods improved. This does not mean a return to overpowering state control. But new rules would have to be enacted to stop imports of goods and services that could be produced locally. Industries will have to be located in the local community if they are to win permission to sell in it. Flows of money would be controlled. Competition policy would discriminate in favour of local production. New resource and pollution taxes would be levied to pay for the transition. Today's global casino consists of traders gambling on minute market fluctuations. In 1980, the daily average of foreign trading was $80bn. Today, more than $1,500bn flows daily across international borders. Some 90% of capital flows are speculative (based on movements in currency and interest rates) rather than productive. Democratic control over such capital is the key to providing the money for governments and communities to rebuild. As well as a Tobin-type tax on international capital transactions to curb currency speculators, broader re-regulation of finance capital will be required. This would include physical controls on capital flows, taxes on short-term speculative transactions, tightening of easy credit that allows speculators to multiply the size of their \"bets\" way beyond the cash required to cover them. Also essential is a widespread and coordinated attack on corporate tax evasion, including offshore banking centres. Any one country proposing such controls on its own would immediately be punished by the markets. However, a regional grouping of powerful states such as the European Union would be a secure and lucrative enough market to ensure that those who control money would not dare to leave the safety and security afforded by such a bloc. This pattern would then be attempted globally. In a small way the process has already begun. Last year two Green members of the European parliament, Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert, were elected from the UK on a platform that included such localisation. Ms Lucas, as a member of the parliament's trade committee, has initiated discussions about the Europe-wide changes needed to achieve such an end goal. Politically, the 20th century was a battle between left and right. In the 21st the contest will pit localists against those merely trying to manage globalisation. The former will seek control over the local economy. The latter will continue to see globalisation to be as inevitable as gravity; their role will be to attempt to make it kinder and gentler. The contest will not just play out internationally but - if recent protest is any guide to the movement of opinion - in the internal politics of the rich countries, too.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps she could have elicited more derision by proposing to make the saying of grace before dinner compulsory, or calling for on-the-spot fines for ladies who show their ankles in public. But failing that, it seems hard to imagine how else Ann Widdecombe could have invited as much undiluted scorn as she did by telling the Conservative party conference on Wednesday of her plan to levy fixed penalties of \u00a3100 on anyone found in possession of any quantity of cannabis. Not practical, said the Police Federation. A step backwards, said the Police Superintendents' Association. Not Conservative Party policy, said William Hague.</p> <p>It instantly became clear that the response to her speech wasn't being bolstered by the recreational legalisation lobby - most of whom stopped wasting any of their chemically curtailed anger on the likes of Widdecombe long ago - or simply the indignation of medicinal users. Instead, it reflected a reality even her closest colleagues could not summon the energy to deny: that Britain, statistically speaking, is a nation of cannabis users just as much as it is a nation of golf players or a nation of casino gamblers. Those who behave as if it is still taboo can expect the same mixture of pity and amusement that they might receive had they declared an unshakeable faith in the tooth fairy.</p> <p>According to the most recent figures (the 1998 British Crime Survey), 42% of 16 to 29 year olds have tried cannabis. There is a gulf between the under-30s and over-30s: taken as a whole, only 5% of 16 to 59 year olds had smoked a joint in the last month, though even that compares favourably with many activities, like playing football, or darts, or going jogging.

But failing that, it seems hard to imagine how else Ann Widdecombe could have invited as much undiluted scorn as she did by telling the Conservative party conference on Wednesday of her plan to levy fixed penalties of \u00a3100 on anyone found in possession of any quantity of cannabis. Not practical, said the Police Federation. A step backwards, said the Police Superintendents' Association. Not Conservative Party policy, said William Hague. It instantly became clear that the response to her speech wasn't being bolstered by the recreational legalisation lobby - most of whom stopped wasting any of their chemically curtailed anger on the likes of Widdecombe long ago - or simply the indignation of medicinal users. Instead, it reflected a reality even her closest colleagues could not summon the energy to deny: that Britain, statistically speaking, is a nation of cannabis users just as much as it is a nation of golf players or a nation of casino gamblers. Those who behave as if it is still taboo can expect the same mixture of pity and amusement that they might receive had they declared an unshakeable faith in the tooth fairy. According to the most recent figures (the 1998 British Crime Survey), 42% of 16 to 29 year olds have tried cannabis. There is a gulf between the under-30s and over-30s: taken as a whole, only 5% of 16 to 59 year olds had smoked a joint in the last month, though even that compares favourably with many activities, like playing football, or darts, or going jogging.

A mid-1990s study found that sales of Rizla cigarette papers had grown by 16% over a five year period during which sales of rolling tobacco had declined by 11%: draw your own conclusions. The result, among younger people, has been a profound normalisation of cannabis use. \"Our drug users are essentially extending the same decision-making processes to illicit drugs as others do in respect of cigarette smoking or drinking alcohol - or, indeed, horse-riding, hang gliding or mountaineering,\" three Manchester University researchers wrote in a pathbreaking 1998 study. \"'It's your decision; you take the risk.' \" In the case of cannabis, much medical evidence would seem to suggest that the risk is considerably smaller than that attached to standing up in front of a roomful of people - even Conservative conference delegates - and proposing a hardline alternative.",

      "body": "<b> Ian McEwan</b>, novelist <p>I certainly have smoked cannabis in the past. Ann Widdecombe's remarks about cannabis smoking are ludicrous. The swilling of 14 pints of lager constitutes a far greater social threat than a shared joint. One good development is that this pronouncement will alienate a lot of younger voters and keep the Conservatives out of power. I take heart from this. We've seen enough of them these past two decades. </p> <p><b>Alex Salmond</b>, former leader of the SNP </p> <p>I have never answered the question of whether I have smoked cannabis and I don't intend to now. There are good reasons for not saying. If you say \"yes\" people claim you're encouraging and supporting it and if you say \"no\" it looks like you're a prick. So basically my answer is it's none of your business, but as far as Ann Widdecombe is concerned: I don't agree with her policy. I think she's a very foolish lady. </p> <p> <b> Piers Morgan</b>, editor of the Mirror </p> <p>Do I smoke cannabis? No comment, but you can draw your own conclusions by our front page today. If I ever had smoked cannabis, and I'm not saying I have, I certainly would have inhaled. I'm sure it would have the same effect on me as most people - very little, calming and mellowing. Do I still smoke it? No - not that I ever did. I certainly do not currently partake in any drug taking, but my editing would probably improve if I did. Ann Widdecombe has lectured young people on the perils of having sex, while being a self-confessed virgin. She's now lecturing us on joints, having never been near one in her life. Her comments will have a derisory effect on young people in this country. Ecstasy and other class A drugs are the real problem. </p> <p> <b> Martin Bell</b> , MP </p> <p>I would not be in favour of criminalising people just for smoking marijuana though I am strongly opposed to drugs. I think the present policy of flexible response and caution is right. I've never smoked it myself. I'm so old, it wasn't even a temptation back in those days. It was hardly even heard of. </p> <p> <b> Ben Bradshaw</b>, Labour MP </p> <p>I think it's potty. It's a crack-pot idea. 'Scuse the puns. But the irony of William Hague toasting her speech with a glass of champagne just seems to have been lost on them. The police will tell you how barmy it all is. The idea we should be asking our already overstretched force to take time out from patrolling the streets to criminalise these people is absurd. I'm not answering the question of whether I've smoked it myself. </p> <p> <b> Nigel Evans</b>, Conservative Party vice-chairman </p> <p>I have never smoked cannabis and have turned it down on the few times I have been offered it. Like all so-called soft drugs, cannabis is a gateway to hard drugs. Cannabis is also highly dangerous - it is made up of 400 chemicals. </p> <p> <b> Michael Grade</b> , chairman of Pinewood Studios </p> <p>I'm on the record as saying I have [tried it] and yes, I did inhale. It was all right, not as good as Charlton winning. I don't have a strong view but, by and large, I think it should be decriminalised. I think the police have got better things to do. </p> <p> <b> Eleanor Laing</b>, MP for Epping Forest, and shadow Welsh minister </p> <p>I have never smoked anything, not even cigarettes. I have always preferred gin. At Edinburgh University I must have been to lots of parties where people may or may not have smoked cannabis. It never attracted me. In the law faculty, where I studied, nobody touched the stuff because they didn't want a criminal record. </p> <p> <b> Jacqui Lait</b>, shadow social security minister </p> <p>I tried smoking a cigarette when I was 10 or 11 and immediately gave up because it spoiled the taste of my food. I tried cannabis 10 years later, when I was working for Visnews, and it had the same unpleasant effect. One puff and it was not for me. I couldn't honestly tell you what the taste was like. </p> <p> <b> Jon Snow</b>, newscaster </p> <p>I have tried cannabis. I'm very bad at inhaling because I don't smoke, so I can't say I found it easy. It seemed to me to be perfectly mellow and the only drawback seemed to be the tobacco. </p> <p> <b> Charles Moore</b>, editor of the Daily Telegraph </p> <p>I don't think this is a suitable subject for autobiography. I think the Tories are quite mistaken. I'm against all on-the-spot fines because it gives too much power to the police without legal remedy. I also think it would be a huge burden on the police which would prevent them from pursuing crime that mattered more, and make them unnecessarily unpopular. </p> <p> <b> Stephen O'Brien</b>, MP for Eddisbury and parliamentary aide to Tory party chairman Michael Ancram </p> <p>Have I ever taken a banned substance? The answer to that is no. But when I was a student traveller in Peru in 1978 I chewed a coca cud because it was legal to do that at 9,000ft. I did it for three seconds and was sick. In Bali I was fed a magic mushroom omelette by Australian backpackers who had a good time at my expense. </p> <p> <b> Claire Rayner</b>, agony aunt </p> <p>Oh, of course I smoked it in the 60s - didn't we all try? But no, I didn't like it much. Everyone was trying it and I never believe in condemning something you don't know about, so I tried it but I didn't like it, but I don't like booze either. But alcohol and tobacco do infinitely more harm. I would like to refer Ann Widdecombe to a little bit of American history. Prohibition encourages people: a) to find the product terribly glamorous, and b) sets up a market for wicked people to make a fortune. The only sensible thing to do with cannabis - I'm not going to talk about the others - is to decriminalise it. Any government that has the sense to decriminalise it, shove a hefty tax on it and use the proceeds on the health service, now they would have some sense in them. </p> <p> <b> Roy Hattersley</b>, Labour peer </p> <p>My view of Ann Widdecombe's proposal is that it is impractical to an extent which proves that the Tory party is totally out of touch with 21st-century Britain. I've never taken cannabis, and I never would. I'd be terrified out of my wits. </p> <p> <b> Martin Amis</b> , novelist </p> <p>The proposal is miserably retrograde. Cannabis should be legalised. I've experimented with it myself, but I'm not telling you if I take it now; if I say that she'll be round here, won't she? </p> <p> <b> Anthony Julius</b>, solicitor </p> <p>I wouldn't like to comment on Widdecombe's proposals because I don't know my own mind on the matter. </p> <p> <b> Bill Giles</b>, former BBC weatherman </p> <p>I've never smoked it. I've just not come across it. The job I had in the early days meant you didn't have much of a social life anyway. You used to get the odd one who smoked some wacky baccy, but we did something just as bad, which was drinking a lot of beer. In my day it would have been frowned of because it was just \"horror, horror, horror, it's drugs\" and any drug was under the same title, but now I don't think it would bother too many people. I don't have strong views about it except when it comes to kids. If my child or my grandchild used it I'd probably go ape. I'm not absolutely sure whether it leads to anything else - if not it's not too much of a problem. Unless in 20 years time, like with cigarettes, we find it's been causing lots of damage. </p> <p> <b> Zadie Smith</b>, novelist </p> <p>I have never smoked cannabis in my life ... OK, so I have, but I'm not a huge smoker. I've no objection to it being smoked - it makes people merry. What is there to say about it? It's such an innocuous drug; everyone does it. I would say there are certain people you go to school with who just smoke it forever, and they become quite dull. Ann Widdecombe's idea? I think Ann must have been smoking too much. </p> <p> <b> Andrew Neil</b>, publisher and editor-in-chief, The Scotsman </p> <p>I've never tried it because I'm a rebel and in the 60s everybody was taking it. I didn't like the smell so I'm not happy to be in a room where everybody's smoking it. But if I'm walking down the King's Road and a bunch of kids are coming the other way I'd rather they were high on a bit of weed than tanked up on Carlsberg. I think [Ann Widdecombe's proposal] is bonkers. When you think of all the problems of crime, to start picking up kids because they've got a couple of pieces of marijuana is bizarre. </p> <p> <b> Lewis Wolpert</b>, biologist </p> <p>Everybody smokes dope. The policy is just monstrous, completely out of touch with reality. Have I smoked it? Certainly, of course. Very seldom, now, but I would unhesitatingly have some - and why not? It's lovely. All young people do, too. How dare the Tories interfere. Two-thirds of violent crimes are associated with alcohol. What percentage is involved with pot? Absolutely none. It doesn't make for violence; in fact, you become quite boring. It's outrageous that it isn't freely available. I don't see Ann Widdecombe saying the same things about alcohol. Her speech was impertinent and out of touch. </p> <p> <b> Peter Bazalgette</b>, creative director of Endemol, creators of Big Brother </p> <p>The idea is completely ludicrous, utterly ridiculous. She made herself a laughing stock. Alcohol causes far more problems, and yet she attacks drugs and then downs a glass of champagne. She should be fined for antisocial behaviour. It's fantastically ironic, and pathetic. I have smoked it, the answer has to be yes, like most of my generation. I don't so regularly now, but certainly when I was a schoolboy in the 60s and a student, yes. There are problems with it; there are problems with any substance that intoxicates you. It depends on how it's handled in society. In this case, the law is obviously an ass. The Tories are going in the wrong direction. There are so many more important things to concentrate on. </p> <p> <b> Peregrine Worsthorne</b>, former editor of the Sunday Telegraph </p> <p>It's a ridiculous thing to do - even more ridiculous than the American prohibition idea, which, of course, was a terrible flop. You can't pass a law which a significant minority are not going to pay any attention to. You can't get crazier than that. I have smoked it. It wasn't for me. I'm an alcohol addict, so I didn't need anything extra. But so many friends do smoke it. It's now just a common occurrence. </p> <p> <b> Peter Carter-Ruck</b>, solicitor </p> <p>I resigned from the Conservative Party because of their failure to deal with law and order. I admire Ann Widdecombe, but I don't think that one zero tolerance measure will deal with the problem of drugs. It needs to be dealt with in a far more sophisticated way. A \u00a3100 fine is not enough - some young people would brag about it. A correction course would be better, with instruction on the great harm of drugs. That would be much more effective. I've never tried drugs and I wouldn't risk it. There is such a great danger of becoming addicted. The thing with drugs is that the effect wears off, and then you have to take something a little stronger.</p>",

I'm an alcohol addict, so I didn't need anything extra. But so many friends do smoke it. It's now just a common occurrence. Peter Carter-Ruck, solicitor I resigned from the Conservative Party because of their failure to deal with law and order. I admire Ann Widdecombe, but I don't think that one zero tolerance measure will deal with the problem of drugs. It needs to be dealt with in a far more sophisticated way. A \u00a3100 fine is not enough - some young people would brag about it. A correction course would be better, with instruction on the great harm of drugs. That would be much more effective. I've never tried drugs and I wouldn't risk it. There is such a great danger of becoming addicted. The thing with drugs is that the effect wears off, and then you have to take something a little stronger.",

Imagine Terry Wogan arriving on the platform with the train spotters in Crewe. They'd be thrilled.</p> <p>Before the leader's entrance, the shadow cabinet was ushered on stage. It was a series of small humiliations which the party management visited upon them. When Ann Widdecombe came out from behind the lights, her face was lit by a hideous green. Then Michael Portillo, bathed in blue. He looked like Richard Nixon with a hangover.</p> <p>The two were forced to sit together, since Mr Hague knows that as long as these two rivals cancel each other out, his position is safe. Then they were forced to sit through jaw aching tributes to constituency chairmen, agents and membership secretaries.</p> <p>Finally Mr Davidson walked over and demanded money from them. \"Come on,\" he said, \"they don't spend a lot on clothes, do they?\"</p> <p>Then the leader emerged. Or rather we had a dramatically dull cine-verite shot of him walking down corridors to the platform. As he reached the hall the stage lights changed to a brilliant, dazzling white, like a Victorian painting of the kingdom of heaven. Triumphalist, martial music boomed out. He stood smiling in the lights, the fighting foetus, ready to rock. His trousers were surprisingly crumpled. Memo to Tory leader: if you decide to wrestle a few energising rounds with Seb Coe before a speech, take your suit off first.</p> <p>Finally the speech was over, and we emerged blinking from the light. On cable news, Belgrade was burning. Poor William, upstaged by the people of Serbia, but also, deliberately, by himself.</p> <p><br><b>How the conference saw it</b><br></p> <p><b> Jim Davidson</b>, comedian, ardent Tory fundraiser, and warm-up act for Mr Hague.</p> <p>\"He was very good, wasn't he, much better than that other funny bloke - what's he called, the prime minister? This is a politician that speaks from the heart, rather than just saying, like Blair, anything he thinks people want to hear.\"</p> <p><b> Michael Heseltine</b> , former deputy prime minister.</p> <p>\"This is a speech that's placed him firmly back in the centre of the great tradition of one nation Conservatism and drawn the battle lines from which the Conservatives will appeal across a broad front to the British people. The divisions over Europe will remain. But if Europe is the one area of policy about which there will remain disagreement, on a vast range of policies there will be unity.\"</p> <p><b> Lord Strathclyde,</b> Tory leader in the Lords.</p> <p>\"William Hague is an orator - but this wasn't just a normal, highly effective performance. He was reaching out to people who share Conservative values but weren't here for the conference - people in inner cities, in sink estates, people on pensions, who feel politicians have let them down.\"</p> <p><b> Doreen Whitehead</b>, aka \"Mother Goose\"- William Hague's friend of 10 years and kitchen table adviser.</p> <p>In her sixties and from Keld, Swaledale, North Yorkshire, she runs a B&amp;B where the Hagues often stay and where he \"tests out\" future policies with her. \"It was a wonderful speech. It made me so happy and so proud of William that everything just welled up inside me. It also made me feel so British and we want to stay that way, controlling our own destiny, setting our own interest rates.\"</p> <p><b> Sharon Buckle</b>, a pharmacist and would-be Tory candidate, from Nottingham.</p> <p>\"It wasn't a tirade. It wasn't too over the top about being British. It was very sensible, very open, very honest, and it was upbeat. What came across to me very strongly was his stature. A lot of people have said in the past he's too funny, whereas today he was talking to the adults, and what we saw was him being very statesmanlike. Genuinely PM material.\"</p> <p><b>Ray Miles</b>, aged 76, a retired site manager from Wellinborough, Northants.</p> <p>\"His speech was absolutely excellent. First class. He covered all sorts of issues and I think he appealed to the younger generation as well as us older ones. I don't know why you say the applause was subdued: from where we were he seemed to be rapturously received. And of course I was particularly pleased because of his pledge to keep the pound.\"</p> <p><b>Liam Fox</b>, shadow health secretary.</p> <p>\"I thought it was the most mature conference speech he's given. It was less gimmicky and I think it was reaching out to people beyond the hall in a much more effective way.</p> <p>\"What it did was to say to people: If you're becoming disillusioned with politicians, if you think they're all the same, they're not. The tone of the speech also treated the audience with respect, as intelligent people capable of grasping subtle messages. I really liked it a lot.\"</p>",

Imagine Terry Wogan arriving on the platform with the train spotters in Crewe. They'd be thrilled. Before the leader's entrance, the shadow cabinet was ushered on stage. It was a series of small humiliations which the party management visited upon them. When Ann Widdecombe came out from behind the lights, her face was lit by a hideous green. Then Michael Portillo, bathed in blue. He looked like Richard Nixon with a hangover. The two were forced to sit together, since Mr Hague knows that as long as these two rivals cancel each other out, his position is safe. Then they were forced to sit through jaw aching tributes to constituency chairmen, agents and membership secretaries. Finally Mr Davidson walked over and demanded money from them. \"Come on,\" he said, \"they don't spend a lot on clothes, do they?\" Then the leader emerged. Or rather we had a dramatically dull cine-verite shot of him walking down corridors to the platform. As he reached the hall the stage lights changed to a brilliant, dazzling white, like a Victorian painting of the kingdom of heaven. Triumphalist, martial music boomed out. He stood smiling in the lights, the fighting foetus, ready to rock. His trousers were surprisingly crumpled. Memo to Tory leader: if you decide to wrestle a few energising rounds with Seb Coe before a speech, take your suit off first. Finally the speech was over, and we emerged blinking from the light. On cable news, Belgrade was burning. Poor William, upstaged by the people of Serbia, but also, deliberately, by himself. How the conference saw it Jim Davidson, comedian, ardent Tory fundraiser, and warm-up act for Mr Hague. \"He was very good, wasn't he, much better than that other funny bloke - what's he called, the prime minister? This is a politician that speaks from the heart, rather than just saying, like Blair, anything he thinks people want to hear.\" Michael Heseltine , former deputy prime minister. \"This is a speech that's placed him firmly back in the centre of the great tradition of one nation Conservatism and drawn the battle lines from which the Conservatives will appeal across a broad front to the British people. The divisions over Europe will remain. But if Europe is the one area of policy about which there will remain disagreement, on a vast range of policies there will be unity.\" Lord Strathclyde, Tory leader in the Lords. \"William Hague is an orator - but this wasn't just a normal, highly effective performance. He was reaching out to people who share Conservative values but weren't here for the conference - people in inner cities, in sink estates, people on pensions, who feel politicians have let them down.\" Doreen Whitehead, aka \"Mother Goose\"- William Hague's friend of 10 years and kitchen table adviser. In her sixties and from Keld, Swaledale, North Yorkshire, she runs a B&amp;B where the Hagues often stay and where he \"tests out\" future policies with her. \"It was a wonderful speech. It made me so happy and so proud of William that everything just welled up inside me. It also made me feel so British and we want to stay that way, controlling our own destiny, setting our own interest rates.\" Sharon Buckle, a pharmacist and would-be Tory candidate, from Nottingham. \"It wasn't a tirade. It wasn't too over the top about being British. It was very sensible, very open, very honest, and it was upbeat. What came across to me very strongly was his stature. A lot of people have said in the past he's too funny, whereas today he was talking to the adults, and what we saw was him being very statesmanlike. Genuinely PM material.\" Ray Miles, aged 76, a retired site manager from Wellinborough, Northants. \"His speech was absolutely excellent. First class. He covered all sorts of issues and I think he appealed to the younger generation as well as us older ones. I don't know why you say the applause was subdued: from where we were he seemed to be rapturously received. And of course I was particularly pleased because of his pledge to keep the pound.\" Liam Fox, shadow health secretary. \"I thought it was the most mature conference speech he's given. It was less gimmicky and I think it was reaching out to people beyond the hall in a much more effective way. \"What it did was to say to people: If you're becoming disillusioned with politicians, if you think they're all the same, they're not. The tone of the speech also treated the audience with respect, as intelligent people capable of grasping subtle messages. I really liked it a lot.\"",

      "byline": "Simon Hattenstone",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anne Robinson lies on her sofa in her black leather pants and her black boots and her black sleeveless T-shirt, knees up, legs akimbo. We're at her Kensington home, she feels relaxed; I feel like a gynaecologist. The investigative journalist, bitchy columnist, consumer champion and TV personality has finally transcended her previous achievements. She's now a fully-fledged star. As presenter of the phenomenally successful afternoon programme The Weakest Link, she has just been voted the rudest woman on television by the TV Times. </p> <p>The Weakest Link is the general knowledge equivalent of Big Brother. Contestants form a team and fight for money. In the process they stab fellow contestants in the back and front, as they vote the others off the team round by round. There are none of the niceties associated with quiz shows. Robinson berates the players, tells them they are a disappointment, that they deserve to be dumped. When they lose they leave with nothing beyond the curtest \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye.\" There's something of the school ma'am in her, something of the dominatrix, something of the PoW camp commandant. </p> <p>I tell Robinson that when I see her I want to turn the television off, that I can't abide her, she's vile. \"Did you come back and watch again? All I can say is 4.8m viewers at 5.15pm. What else can I say, Simon.\" </p> <p>John Penrose, her husband and manager, serves the coffee, and asks if it's OK. Occasionally she calls him Johnny, but more often Penrose. I can't help thinking of Hudson in Upstairs Downstairs. He's off to buy Annie a new printer. She buys a lot of printers. Actually, she buys a lot of everything. Robinson tells me how yesterday she was shopping and came across this wonderful wallet for her Psion organiser. The only problem was that she didn't have an organiser. She bought it anyway. Still, what's \u00a3200? </p> <p>\"I said you're supposed to look at the features of an organiser before you buy the case,\" Penrose says. \"Shall I just give you a kiss for the benefit of the visiting journalist?\" He plonks a smacker on her crown as he leaves. She gives him a farewell wink. </p> <p>Ask journalists what Robinson was like 30 years ago and you get a pile of admiring tributes - what a great reporter she was, smart, unflappable, determined. Ask people who have worked with her more recently. They tend to talk about her bossiness, her intolerance, her queenliness, and the banality of her columns in the Times. </p> <p>What the carpers can't deny is Robinson's success. She was famously the best-paid woman in British journalism, and recently said she planned to earn \u00a31m a year. Had she managed it? She shuts her legs. \"Yes. Actually, last year I hit two million. But I work really hard. We didn't quite hit it, and I said to Penrose, let's do one more gig.\" </p> <p>She loves money, says that she always thought the smart way to freedom for women was through the purse strings. \"It cut out a lot of crap and a lot of having to go to meetings to campaign for equality.\" She stage-whispers when I ask her for figures - the \u00a32m, the \u00a3250,000 advance for her autobiography, the \u00a3350 for her leather pants. </p> <p>Money isn't everything, though, she says. Take TV - you must be careful with the choices you make. She gives out handy hints by the second. Robinson was asked to read the news way before Angela Rippon but she turned it down. \"I thought I was too good a journalist to do that.\" She's got a fabulous way with putdowns. The black suede boot with steel toecaps. </p> <p>The Weakest Link has been called \"mean TV\". She says she doesn't know about that, but what she does know is that so much television is bogus, soft, and offers false comforts. \"It's not Noel Edmonds, Lulu, Little and Large. There's an edge to it. They say they couldn't have found anyone else who is prepared to talk like that.\" </p> <p>What does she mean? \"Well I'm not really a showbiz person. I'm just a direct person.\" Did they mean they couldn't find anyone who would be so horrid to the contestants? She recoils. \"I'm not really horrible.\" You have your moments. \"I have my moments, but I'm only there on behalf of the viewer.\" </p> <p>She's certainly not being horrible now. Far from it. </p> <p>\"What about having a look at the photos?\" She gives me a guided tour. Annie Robinson, a life in pictures. Here's Annie in the pony club as a kid (\"middle class me\"), Annie with Michael Foot and Jill Craigie not long before she died - \"My Labour credentials. No don't quote that. They're like step-parents ... sooooh sad.\" Her first marriage to Charlie Wilson. \"Those knees! I look like Cilla Black.\" Wilson is her first husband, father of her daughter Emma and her former boss at the Mirror. </p> <p>\"Charlie rang Johnny yesterday because I was voted the rudest woman on television and they both said that the public had learnt what they'd known for 30 years.\" </p> <p>Why is she so rude? \"I don't think I am that rude, Simon.\" But they do. \"It was a joke. God almighty, as Emma says, j-o-k-e. What else can we show you?\" </p> <p>Of course she's not rude. She talks about journalists who have visited in the past. \"The advantage of you, Simon, is you're not female, you're not tired , you've not got a problem with not having a boyfriend, you're not worried about the cats at home, and you're not drinking all my white wine. Because that's often the situation I find myself in sitting here.\" Brilliant! Massage my ego, while putting down the rest of the world. </p> <p>She tells me of a journalist who said she had flabby arms. \"What d'you think? Have a go.\" I take her upper arm and give it a wobble as instructed. Have you been working on them? \"Yes, I've been swimming every morning. Do you work out?\" I say I've done the occasional press-up in my time. \"Do you have a male or female partner?\" Female. \"How old are your kids?\" Eight and six. \"You don't look old enough.\" Rudest woman in Britain! </p> <p>She starts impersonating Margaret Thatcher, and says that after all those years hounding her she discovered she admired her courage. Does she detest weakness? \"Well all bullies hate weakness.\" Are you a bully? \"Yes. I'll bully anyone who's up to it.\" She mentions Watchdog when she's had enough of listening to her juniors and says, \"No, right, we're doing it this way.\" </p> <p>She says she's never been a team player and returns to her childhood to explain why. Her mother started selling chickens on the market and became the poultry queen of the north-west. \"One of the problems in life is that all the qualities you require to get ahead in a commercial way require you to not trust and do your own things and to hell with the rest, and in a sense they are opposite to the qualities you require to live in harmony with a partner.\" </p> <p>Robinson has a knack of telling anecdotes from out of the blue. She talks about Ian MacGregor, Thatcher's henchman in the mining strike. \"He was married for 47 years, and everyday he asked his wife whether she took sugar in her tea.\" </p> <p>Does she relate to that? \"I certainly keep forgetting whether Penrose's birthday is the 9th or 10th. But I know the first car registration I had at 18. PAR18.\" </p> <p>The conflict between team play and individual ambition is at the heart of the Weakest Link. She tells me of a tribe in Uganda that had been dumped in the mountains, and how within three generations they had turned into savages who threw out their grandparents when they couldn't provide food. \"I believe there's a savage in most people.\" </p> <p>I tell her again that I think the way the quiz show exploits the savage in us all is cruel. \"You're missing the whole point, Simon.\" Which is? \"The point is ... Somebody at the BBC, somebody very courageous, said I don't like you on that programme. You are so rude, and I just went, 4.8 ... the viewing figures are unheard of.\" </p> <p>She asks me if I'd like something to eat. \"Because I'm always on a low carbohydrate diet, we've only got raspberries and yoghurt or All Bran and yoghurt. Simon, can I just say I'm now 56 ... I do enjoy the position of not that many people arguing with me. Do I look 56?\" she does a twirl. </p> <p>What if I said to you, yes you do, and some. She burst out laughing. \"I'd say you're lying. You're lying. Because I don't look 'and some'. 50 maybe.\" </p> <p>Anyway this rudeness stuff, she says, is nonsense. \"If you see the show once you think I'm very rude, if you see it more than once and you see the wink at the end you know it's a conspiracy between me and the viewers.\" Conspiracy shmiracy, it's just Annie and her old shtick. She says the Annie of Watchdog is much closer to her real self than the Annie of the Weakest Link, but I'm not so sure. </p> <p>We're running out of time. Robinson has to be at the Beeb for Watchdog. \"They can't start without me.\" On the way out she hands me a press release from yet another telly thing she's doing. \"It won't do you any harm darling.\" She once said that in order to succeed in life you need an uncrushable belief in yourself. Has she had it? No, she says, everyone's vulnerable. \"No one who drank like I did has an uncrushable belief in themselves.

No one's, I say, I like what I'm doing, I don't want anyone's job. She stammers her reply. \"Well, that's good isn't it?\" But she looks horrified.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anne Robinson lies on her sofa in her black leather pants and her black boots and her black sleeveless T-shirt, knees up, legs akimbo. We're at her Kensington home, she feels relaxed; I feel like a gynaecologist. The investigative journalist, bitchy columnist, consumer champion and TV personality has finally transcended her previous achievements. She's now a fully-fledged star. As presenter of the phenomenally successful afternoon programme The Weakest Link, she has just been voted the rudest woman on television by the TV Times. The Weakest Link is the general knowledge equivalent of Big Brother. Contestants form a team and fight for money. In the process they stab fellow contestants in the back and front, as they vote the others off the team round by round. There are none of the niceties associated with quiz shows. Robinson berates the players, tells them they are a disappointment, that they deserve to be dumped. When they lose they leave with nothing beyond the curtest \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye.\" There's something of the school ma'am in her, something of the dominatrix, something of the PoW camp commandant. I tell Robinson that when I see her I want to turn the television off, that I can't abide her, she's vile. \"Did you come back and watch again? All I can say is 4.8m viewers at 5.15pm. What else can I say, Simon.\" John Penrose, her husband and manager, serves the coffee, and asks if it's OK. Occasionally she calls him Johnny, but more often Penrose. I can't help thinking of Hudson in Upstairs Downstairs. He's off to buy Annie a new printer. She buys a lot of printers. Actually, she buys a lot of everything. Robinson tells me how yesterday she was shopping and came across this wonderful wallet for her Psion organiser. The only problem was that she didn't have an organiser. She bought it anyway. Still, what's \u00a3200? \"I said you're supposed to look at the features of an organiser before you buy the case,\" Penrose says. \"Shall I just give you a kiss for the benefit of the visiting journalist?\" He plonks a smacker on her crown as he leaves. She gives him a farewell wink. Ask journalists what Robinson was like 30 years ago and you get a pile of admiring tributes - what a great reporter she was, smart, unflappable, determined. Ask people who have worked with her more recently. They tend to talk about her bossiness, her intolerance, her queenliness, and the banality of her columns in the Times. What the carpers can't deny is Robinson's success. She was famously the best-paid woman in British journalism, and recently said she planned to earn \u00a31m a year. Had she managed it? She shuts her legs. \"Yes. Actually, last year I hit two million. But I work really hard. We didn't quite hit it, and I said to Penrose, let's do one more gig.\" She loves money, says that she always thought the smart way to freedom for women was through the purse strings. \"It cut out a lot of crap and a lot of having to go to meetings to campaign for equality.\" She stage-whispers when I ask her for figures - the \u00a32m, the \u00a3250,000 advance for her autobiography, the \u00a3350 for her leather pants. Money isn't everything, though, she says. Take TV - you must be careful with the choices you make. She gives out handy hints by the second. Robinson was asked to read the news way before Angela Rippon but she turned it down. \"I thought I was too good a journalist to do that.\" She's got a fabulous way with putdowns. The black suede boot with steel toecaps. The Weakest Link has been called \"mean TV\". She says she doesn't know about that, but what she does know is that so much television is bogus, soft, and offers false comforts. \"It's not Noel Edmonds, Lulu, Little and Large. There's an edge to it. They say they couldn't have found anyone else who is prepared to talk like that.\" What does she mean? \"Well I'm not really a showbiz person. I'm just a direct person.\" Did they mean they couldn't find anyone who would be so horrid to the contestants?

History cannot be stopped. \"I want to solemnly tell all those who support Milosevic that they are taking very, very big risks and a very, very serious responsibility towards their country.\" Germany Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der urged restraint by both Mr Milosevic and opposition leaders. \"My appeal is: don't resort to violence, don't shoot on your own people. That would be catastrophic,\" he said. He warned that violence in Belgrade would trigger \"resistance\" from the international community. European Union The EU condemned the constitutional court's decision to annul the election. \"The only aim of this decision is to deny the victory of Vojislav Kostunica in the September 24 poll,\" a statement issued by the French presidency of the 15-country union said. \"Slobodan Milosevic, after trying to rig the results of the September 24 poll and hold a fraudulent second round, is trying again to steal victory in a stubborn rearguard battle.\" United Nations The secretary general, Kofi Annan, said there was little the UN could do to defuse the situation or help opposition forces ease Mr Milosevic out. \"There have been quite a lot of statements by UN member states who have tried to move the situation forward and encourage a rapid solution,\" Mr Annan said. \"Beyond that I'm not sure if there is any concrete action one can take in this situation.\" Greece The government of Greece, much of whose population opposed the Nato bombing of Belgrade last year, warned that if Mr Milosevic used force against demonstrating civilians he could spark a civil war. \"It would be tragic for the region and for Yugoslavia itself,\" the foreign minister, George Papandreou, told Greek television. \"Every democratic country... resolves its problems in a peaceful way. This is what we are asking.\"",

      "bodyText": "England's senior family judge is expected to rule today that two patients in a state of \"living death\" can be allowed to die, despite the right to life enshrined in English law this week by the Human Rights Act. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, president of the high court family division, has been asked to decide whether the act, which came into force on Monday, prevents doctors from withdrawing artificial feeding from patients in a permanent vegetative state (PVS). The two women, named as Mrs M and Ms H, are oblivious to their surroundings and have no hope of recovery, according to independent specialists. The official solicitor, Laurence Oates, representing the two patients, had considered opposing applications from their doctors for the go-ahead to withdraw tubal feeding. But yesterday both sides agreed that the right to life, though it places a positive obligation on the state to safeguard life, allows withdrawal of treatment from which a patient derives no benefit. Around 20 PVS patients have been allowed to die since the House of Lords ruled in 1993 that feeding could be withdrawn from the Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland. But the courts have had to consider the issue afresh after implementation of the Human Rights Act, which makes the European convention on human rights part of English law. Mrs M, 49, has been in PVS for three years after an anaesthetic mishap during surgery in a foreign hospital. Ms H, 36, had a heart attack that deprived her brain of oxygen in January, when she was in hospital being treated for pancreatitis. John Grace QC, representing the two north of England hospital trusts treating the women, told Dame Elizabeth that the families in both cases supported the application to withdraw feeding. \"No amount of rhetoric as to the law should obscure the tragedies behind these cases,\" he said. \"Expert independent witnesses agree they are undoubtedly cases of PVS, described as a twilight zone of suspended animation where death commences while life continues - a living death.\" Both patients were the \"victims\" of medical technology that did not exist when the human rights convention was formulated in 1950. But the principles established in the Bland case amounted to \"an adequate protection\" under the convention's right to life provisions. He said this was accepted by Ben Emmerson QC, who is representing the patients through the official solicitor. Mr Grace said doctors had estimated that if life support continued Mrs M could live for 12 years or even longer. If doctors withdrew feeding and hydration, she would die within five to 14 days without distress. A relative had described her as \"someone who was full of life\" who would not want to live as she was now. Ms H, who suffered from severe epilepsy for most of her life, was \"described by everyone as having been a lively and bubbly personality\", said Mr Grace. Artificial feeding had been a constant problem. Her feeding tube had become blocked on September 23, so she was receiving only hydration and drugs.

Mr Owen is seen to joke that the amount of beer he has drunk had brought on \"the DTs\".

A spokeswoman said the airline would be conducting an internal inquiry. The British Air Line Pilots' Association attacked the programme for \"its underhand and disgraceful journalistic methods, which could be described as entrapment\". Two years ago a BA pilot, Nigel King, was sacked after breaking the airline's rule on not drinking for before a flight. Last year the pilot of a Virgin Express Boeing 737 resigned after passengers complained he appeared to be drunk. Last month two EasyJet pilots were grounded after claims that they drank a \"small amount\" the evening before they were due to leave Luton airport. Legislation bringing in random alcohol breath-testing for all pilots is to be introduced as soon as parliamentary time permits, the Department of Transport said yesterday. But consultations with the civil aviation authority, European flight regulators and unions have been slow, and the draft legislation, begun under the previous government, has made little progress.

After 13 years of lies, assassination, repression, and war-mongering, the Serbian people, bravely marching and striking in their hundreds of thousands, have finally demonstrated, once and for all, that they are no longer afraid of the \"butcher of the Balkans\".</p> <p>The uprising was the culmination of a week of hitherto non-violent civil disobedience that united miners, industrial workers, students and shopkeepers in an unprecedented show of defiance. It reflected in effect a national refusal to accept the gerrymandered results of last month's presidential election.</p> <p>It was an expression of the long-suppressed yearning for change which Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, successfully turned into a tidal wave of votes on September 24. It was, above all, a total, contemptuous and fearless rejection of one man.

      "bodyText": "The popular revolt that exploded across Belgrade yesterday afternoon marked the end of Slobodan Milosevic's long rule of fear. After 13 years of lies, assassination, repression, and war-mongering, the Serbian people, bravely marching and striking in their hundreds of thousands, have finally demonstrated, once and for all, that they are no longer afraid of the \"butcher of the Balkans\". The uprising was the culmination of a week of hitherto non-violent civil disobedience that united miners, industrial workers, students and shopkeepers in an unprecedented show of defiance. It reflected in effect a national refusal to accept the gerrymandered results of last month's presidential election. It was an expression of the long-suppressed yearning for change which Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition leader, successfully turned into a tidal wave of votes on September 24. It was, above all, a total, contemptuous and fearless rejection of one man. Mr Milosevic's sole remaining motivation now is his own fear, of retribution, assassination, of the waiting war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The question for him last night was whether to give in or fight back. His Socialist party insisted it would resist to the end by every means. But the outcome appeared to rest, crucially, on the reaction of the Yugoslav army, should it be ordered to send tanks against its own people. The cathartic trigger for this upheaval was the most egregious effort yet by Mr Milosevic to thwart the people's manifest will.

Personality: You're in the \"luxury fashion retail market\", it says here; hence you're very much an ABC1 adult, aged 20-plus, living in the catchment areas of either London or Leeds (where the two Harvey Nicks stores are). Financial status: You've either got a very chunky disposable income or just like to splash out once a year on some ludicrously overpriced fashion item. So you're either a smart young professional or just a style-conscious student. Telling lifestyle detail: Dahhhling, where should I begin? The cars, the far-flung holidays, the gorgeous little weekends away... Other relevant data: Harvey and Hibby's clothes were made from chopped-up pieces of genuine designer gear, and permission had to be sought from the designers themselves. And the fashion community think the ad's cool: even Vogue's publishing director has given it the thumbs up.",

What's more the Irish Republic has given up its historic claim to the north, rewording its constitution accordingly. No unionist leader ever won such a prize before.</p> <p>But if these advances seem abstract, Trimble should ask unionists to look around. Yes, there is still violence - from the fratricidal feuding on the Shankill Road to the enduring menace of the Real IRA - but the once all-pervasive threat from the provisionals has been quieted. The IRA has made as clear as it can its resignation from warfare, opening up its once top-secret arsenals to outside inspection - unimaginable a decade ago.

      "bodyText": "Mad Dog And Glory (John McNaughton, 1993) 9.30pm, 2.25am, Sky Cinema Mad Dog is the ironic nickname of Robert De Niro's lonely, inhibited police photographer; Uma Thurman's Glory is the shopgirl \"given\" to him for a week as a reward for saving the life of mobster Milo (Bill Murray) during an armed raid. The intriguing set-up blends thriller, romance and comedy; the quality cast makes it surprisingly touching - as much in Mad Dog's affectionate relationship with Milo as his love for Glory. Badlands (Terrence Malick, 1973) 11.05am, TCM Malick's brilliant debut paints a vivid picture of two alienated young Americans who become almost-innocent killers. Martin Sheen plays Kit, the garbageman who falls for Sissy Spacek's 15-year-old Holly; the union's sealed in blood when he murders her father (Warren Oates). Stark and unjudgmental, there are hints of Malick's mystical war film, The Thin Red Line: brutalities committed in stunning landscapes, here the Dakota Badlands; and the inner monologues of people locked in desperate situations, stumbling after some meaning. Les Diaboliques (Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1955) 2.15am, FilmFour There was no more misanthropic and dark a practitioner of French noir than the bitter Clouzot, and this is a prime example. It's the story of a murder - ailing and bullied wife Vera Clouzot (the director's spouse) teaming up with spurned mistress Simone Signoret to kill her husband, vicious boarding school head Paul Meurisse. And then the body disappears. The subsequent investigation uncovers a heap of human misery and thwarted desire - so don't expect too many laughs.",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore may be leading George W Bush in the latest opinion polls, but the Democratic candidate for the White House is facing a renewed flurry of damaging accusations that he has made up and exaggerated a series of stories on the presidential campaign trail. As he prepared to debate with the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, in Kentucky last night, Mr Bush's Republican running mate, Dick Cheney, made an issue of Mr Gore's apparent tendency to embellish his own experiences and achievements. Mr Cheney said he was \"puzzled and saddened\" by new examples of Mr Gore's supposed economy with the facts. Mr Bush's aides also spoke of \"a troubling pattern\" in Mr Gore's claims. The allegations focus on a series of anecdotes he told in Tuesday's presidential debate. At first he said that a Florida school had forced a student to stand during classes because she was the 36th student in a class originally intended for 24; it turned out that the classroom in Sarasota high school was being renovated to accommodate new laboratory equipment. Later in the debate he told a story about a 79-year-old woman who \"has to go out seven days a week\" to collect cans for recycling to help pay for her medicines. The woman, Winifred Skinner, had \"come all the way from Iowa\" with her poodle to tell her story, Mr Gore said. But last night Republicans said that Ms Skinner was \"a rather eccentric woman\" who refused to accept financial support from her family and whose trip to the debate had in any case been paid for by the Gore campaign. Mr Gore also described accompanying senior federal disaster-relief officials on a trip to Texas in 1998 to assess the damage caused by forest fires. In fact he had been in Texas for a political fundraising event and met some relief officials when their paths crossed at Houston airport. \"I got that wrong then,\" he confessed in a television interview. An occasional slip of the tongue might be forgiven, but his opponents say Mr Gore has repeatedly \"misspoken\" about his life in ways which they believe add up to a flaw in a man who hopes to be president. \"I have learned over the years that if someone embellishes the resume in a job interview, don't hire them,\" Mr Cheney said before last night's clash with Mr Lieberman. \"This is another disturbing pattern, when under pressure the vice-president simply makes things up,\" Mr Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes said. As this issue has long dogged his candidacy, Mr Gore is now fixed in some minds as a man perpetually given to overstating the facts: famously depicting himself as the inventor of the internet, for example. Some of these tales are less Mr Gore's own inventions than the inventions of his political enemies.

      "bodyText": "Police investigating the disappearance of a woman and her four teenage children will this morning begin removing human remains from an isolated field six miles from a garden woodshed where three bodies were found yesterday. A murder inquiry was launched after the first body was discovered beneath a pile of firewood in the shed in the west Cornwall hamlet of Carnkie early yesterday. Another two bodies were found later. Investigators could not confirm the age or sex of the three bodies, which are believed to have lain there for up to four weeks. The discovery has horrified friends and neighbours of Lesley Ford, 36, who disappeared more than a month ago with the four teenage children from her first marriage. Mrs Ford was not reported missing until last week when her brother, from Hampshire, raised the alarm. Mrs Ford's husband Lee, 33, with whom she has two children, was interviewed about her disappearance after she was reported missing and told police his wife had left home after a family argument. He is being questioned at Camborne police station on suspicion of murder. The couple's children, Leanne, three, and Kieran, nine, are being looked after by relatives in Shropshire. Both are said to be safe and well. Detectives, who began a thorough examination of the family bungalow two days ago, yesterday extended their search to a recently ploughed wheat field at Treluswell, near Penryn, after interviewing Mr Ford. A large area around the field has been sealed off and a tent erected over the spot where two bodies are believed to have been buried. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police confirmed that human remains had been found at the site. A pathologist is expected to visit the site this morning before the remains are removed. The bodies are thought to have been buried deeply enough not to have been noticed by the farmer who owns the land, even though he has ploughed it since. He has told police he has never seen any suspicious activity in the area. Mr Ford has not been taken to the scene. As forensic experts continued to carry out a fingertip search of the drab pebble-dashed bungalow which the Fords moved into only two years ago, neighbours were finding it difficult to come to terms with the horrific events that appeared to have taken place in their midst. Jack Prowse, 70, who lives two doors away from the Fords, said his neighbours were \"just an ordinary family\" although Mr Ford, a ponytailed jobbing builder and roofer, was \"a bit way out with his hairstyle\". The Fords moved into the \u00a385,000 bungalow two years ago and sent the two youngest children to the Halwin junior and infant school at Porkellis just a mile or so down the road. Three of Mrs Ford's teenage children Craig, 13, Stephen, 14, and Anne Marie, 16, were pupils at Helston school, while her eldest daughter, Sarah Jane, 17, who also went to the school, had a job at a nearby McDonald's restaurant. None of the children returned to Helston at the start of the new school year in September and it is understood that Mr Ford phoned staff to explain their absence. Schoolfriends of the teenagers were yesterday being offered the support of educational psychologists as news of their absence from school be gan to take on more sinister overtones. David Taylor, the school's deputy head, said pupils had ended the day \"fearing the worst\" for their schoolmates. \"We are all very worried about them. While the police are investigating their whereabouts it is clearly going to be a difficult time for their schoolfriends.\"",

Corby community college in Northamptonshire has been seven teachers short of its full complement of 52 staff since it opened at the start of term. From Monday, each year group will have one day working from home each week, in yet another blow to education secretary David Blunkett's flagship scheme for turning round failing schools. Among the vacancies waiting to be filled are three maths and one modern languages teaching jobs - both shortage subjects amid continued complaints from unions of a national recruitment crisis. Corby college, produced from the merger of two failing schools, Beanfield and Queen Elizabeth, is not the only one in Mr Blunkett's troubled flagship scheme for turning round failing schools to have had problems attracting staff. Northamptonshire local education authority has launched an emergency recruitment campaign in Australia, the US and Canada, as well as Britain.

Coming out as gay with an asylum-seeking father - what worse could a man own up to in that fearsome Bournemouth hall?

The European Commission might want to harmonise uniforms and cap badges, or even to metricate them. The European Court would probably want to stop our men fighting for more than 40 hours a week. They would probably have sent half of them home on paternity leave!\" And the finishing war cry: \"Around the world three letters send a chill down the spine of the enemy - SAS. And those letters spell out one clear message: don't mess with Britain. The SAS has a famous motto: Who Dares Wins. We will dare, we will win!\" From Rambo in 1996 to Cliff Richard in 2000 - another year, another end-of-the-pier show.</p> <p>So which way should William Hague turn? Towards Widdecombe's social whips and chains, old Portillo's union flag or new Portillo's I-feel-your-pain? Easy. Hague took it all in. But it was a remarkable dinosaur of a speech, a classic hour of political emptiness that would have any ordinary audience groaning in agony. Riffs of vacuous verbiage wove worn-out airy phrases in and out and back again to nowhere. \"Making the most of being British\", \"I'm in it for you ... for the real people of this country ... who look to the Tories to give them back their country ... for all the people ... decent law-abiding families, hardworking families, with common sense values\", over and over again, excruciating nothingness. Even his debating-society wit would have made a schoolboy wince: \"Less PC and more PCs!\"</p> <p>Where in all this was the substance? More BSE than beef. And yet the dim outline of the coming election lurked within the leaden clouds. First law and order - \"No government has ever been as tough on law and order as we will be.\" Then the real battleground: \"No government has ever been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.\" This is the crunch, the nugget in the dross. \"Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\" (a George W Bush line). Yet how will it be done? All week they have billowed out an extraordinary list of spending promises.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo seems to have been too busy practicing his lines in the mirror to rein in the profligacy of his comrades who have spent recklessly whenever they opened their mouths. More on pensions, whatever Labour offers. As much on schools and hospitals whatever Labour spends, unimaginable sums on locking in asylum seekers. A fortune on more police and yet more prison, stopping what Hague called \"prisoners idling in their cells\". Undisclosed sums knocking down tower blocks, petrol tax cut, more money for farmers and hauliers. (Hague did a good I-feel-your-pain about a hardworking trucker far from home.)</p> <p>Where will it all come from? Three throwaway lines suggest a kind of answer. First there was a glancing reference to Gordon Brown's \"surplus millions\", money the Treasury denies exists unless the Tories plan to spend recklessly like Lawson and Lamont did in the good times, only to bust in the next down-turn. Then there was \"cutting fraud\", that old stand-by of phoney economics. Last and horribly plausible was the source that got just one brief sentence, a pledge to cut \"worthless government schemes\". That can only mean one thing, a slash and burn of all the programmes now rolling out, the ones that rarely catch the headlines.</p> <p>No more to Sure Start for the poorest children, no more counsellors and clinics to cut teenage pregnancy, advisers to help the over-50s and single mothers back to work, the million new nursery, child care, after-school and homework club places - plus all the myriad other \"worthless schemes\" unrolling as yet too slowly to have earned public understanding and support. There are indeed billions to be slashed out there with few but the poor to notice their passing.</p> <p>What can Labour learn from watching the Tories? Plenty. What matters is substance, there is nothing else. Less phrase-making, more intellectual rigour. Talk about hard practical things, admit failures, discuss problems, treat voters like grown-ups not like idiots. Let the next manifesto and annual report be nothing but Gradgrind fact, own up to disappointment, never over-promise, never over-claim. Modesty in success, honesty in failure. Above all no cheap tricks. The terrible leaked Gould memo did killer damage to Tony Blair's integrity. Never again louts-to-cash-point law-and-order lollipops: they convince no one. Leave tawdry opportunism to the enemy. Rein in Jack Straw; rise above, don't outbid Widdecombe. Leave emoting to Portillo. The public is canny, its cynicism often justified.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

And yet the dim outline of the coming election lurked within the leaden clouds. First law and order - \"No government has ever been as tough on law and order as we will be.\" Then the real battleground: \"No government has ever been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.\" This is the crunch, the nugget in the dross. \"Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\" (a George W Bush line). Yet how will it be done? All week they have billowed out an extraordinary list of spending promises. Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo seems to have been too busy practicing his lines in the mirror to rein in the profligacy of his comrades who have spent recklessly whenever they opened their mouths. More on pensions, whatever Labour offers. As much on schools and hospitals whatever Labour spends, unimaginable sums on locking in asylum seekers. A fortune on more police and yet more prison, stopping what Hague called \"prisoners idling in their cells\". Undisclosed sums knocking down tower blocks, petrol tax cut, more money for farmers and hauliers. (Hague did a good I-feel-your-pain about a hardworking trucker far from home.) Where will it all come from? Three throwaway lines suggest a kind of answer. First there was a glancing reference to Gordon Brown's \"surplus millions\", money the Treasury denies exists unless the Tories plan to spend recklessly like Lawson and Lamont did in the good times, only to bust in the next down-turn. Then there was \"cutting fraud\", that old stand-by of phoney economics. Last and horribly plausible was the source that got just one brief sentence, a pledge to cut \"worthless government schemes\". That can only mean one thing, a slash and burn of all the programmes now rolling out, the ones that rarely catch the headlines. No more to Sure Start for the poorest children, no more counsellors and clinics to cut teenage pregnancy, advisers to help the over-50s and single mothers back to work, the million new nursery, child care, after-school and homework club places - plus all the myriad other \"worthless schemes\" unrolling as yet too slowly to have earned public understanding and support. There are indeed billions to be slashed out there with few but the poor to notice their passing. What can Labour learn from watching the Tories? Plenty. What matters is substance, there is nothing else. Less phrase-making, more intellectual rigour. Talk about hard practical things, admit failures, discuss problems, treat voters like grown-ups not like idiots. Let the next manifesto and annual report be nothing but Gradgrind fact, own up to disappointment, never over-promise, never over-claim. Modesty in success, honesty in failure. Above all no cheap tricks. The terrible leaked Gould memo did killer damage to Tony Blair's integrity. Never again louts-to-cash-point law-and-order lollipops: they convince no one. Leave tawdry opportunism to the enemy. Rein in Jack Straw; rise above, don't outbid Widdecombe. Leave emoting to Portillo. The public is canny, its cynicism often justified. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

But the \"police monster\" who allegedly killed a young man and his mother because they did not come up with the drug money he demanded is not in the dock; he is the chief prosecution witness, former police officer Rafael Perez. The suggestion that Perez, a corrupt officer who turned informer to escape a long sentence for stealing cocaine from a police locker, is also a murderer is the latest twist in a saga that has transfixed the city and seriously damaged police morale. The trial of four police officers accused of corruption, which started this week, is the first opportunity for the full story of police shootings, drug dealing, bribery and planting of evidence to be told in court. Perez's former girlfriend Sonia Flores claims that he has not told the whole story of his wrongdoing, although he has openly admitted taking part in the shooting of a gang member and planting drugs and weapons on criminals. She says that she was present when Perez and another officer, David Mack, tried to extract money from the young man and his mother in central Los Angeles. When the money was not forthcoming, Perez and Mack, who is serving a jail sentence for bank robbery, shot them, Ms Flores claims. They allegedly wrapped the bodies in carpet and drove them south of the border where a corrupt Mexican officer helped to dump them in a tip. A rubbish tip on a hillside outside Tijuana is due to be searched. If the bodies are found, it will seriously damage Perez's credibility, since he claims to have admitted all his crimes. The four officers from the Rampart division - Edward Ortiz, Brian Liddy, Paul Harper and Michael Buchanan - are accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, perjury, and filing false reports. They are alleged to have planted evidence on a suspect or given false evidence in a 1996 case. The long process of selecting jurors for the trial has begun but the full opening statements will not be made until next week. \"He [Perez] was no more than a street thug in a police uniform, the likes of which this city has never seen before,\" Barry Levin, for the defence, told 120 potential jurors in the superior court. \"His coldness, his callousness, his evil knew no bounds,\" another defence lawyer, Harland Braun, told the jury panel. The trial is the first of many of alleged corrupt officers. It is expected to expose the way in which one of the police divisions in the city routinely beat up, shot, framed and exchanged drugs with gang members. Since Perez started making hisallegations, more than 100 criminal convictions have been overturned and more than 70 officers have been investigated. Millions of dollars have been paid out in compensation to those framed or wounded by police officers. Perez made his deal for a five-year sentence after being caught stealing nearly $1m worth of cocaine. With time served, he could be free by February, but the effects of his allegations will be felt for many years.",

      "bodyText": "A trader who ran up \u00a36m losses and caused the collapse of American and British companies will not be prosecuted. John Ho Park, 29, whose disastrous bet on the German futures market put more than 100 self-employed traders out of work, will not be charged by the Serious Fraud Office. But the old Etonian may still face action by the Securities and Futures Authority, which has the power to fine and expel him from the trading register. The news comes two days after another rogue trader, Stephen Humphries, was jailed for three years and nine months after running up \u00a3750,000 losses which destroyed the finance house, Sussex Futures. He was prosecuted under the Companies Act. Park had been a City high-flier in the mid-1990s, spending five years with Credit Suisse First Boston before branching out on his own in 1997. He set up Griffin Trading, a clearing agent for hundreds of independent traders. But his gamble almost two years ago sparked the biggest financial scandal since Nick Leeson's losses brought Barings Bank to its knees in 1995. The Cambridge university-educated trader left a trail of destruction after continuing to trade when the market had turned against him. Just before Christmas 1998, Mr Park took a bet on the German futures market - which left a multimillion-pound hole in Griffin. Traders at Griffin saw money they had deposited to cover their own dealings used to pay for Mr Park's disasterous punt. The Securities and Futures Authority shut down the London branch of Griffin, while the Chicago-based parent filed for bankruptcy a day later. When his actions were exposed Park fled his London home and went into hiding.",

      "body": "<p>The landscape of Argentina's sub-tropical northern state, Corrientes - the Iber\u00e1 - became the source of the visionary poetry of Francisco Madariaga, who has died aged 73.</p> <p>He lived between noisy, booming Buenos Aires and a hut some 15km from Santa Rosa in Corrientes. All his poetry, with its flashes of tropical intensities, was written from that very urban city to ward off anguish.</p> <p>Though born in the capital, Madariaga moved early to a Corrientes village, only returning to Buenos Aires when he was 15. Corrientes is Argentina's Mesopotamia; it lies between two vast rivers, the Paran\u00e1 and the Uruguay, is dotted with shallow lakes, swamps, dunes and palm trees, and is populated by alligators, wild horses and snakes. It remains wild and backwards even today, with a history of violence and lawlessness, \"a lush anachronism of colours and smells\".</p> <p>When I first met Madariaga in 1970, he offered me some cigars he had made, and invited me to visit him in the wilds. A reticent man, he spoke Spanish with a sing-song, and learnt Guarani, the regional Indian language, perfectly, sprinkling his poems with the odd Guarani words, while citing Rimbaud, DH Lawrence and H\u00f6lderlin. He blended peasant and sophisticate, linking him with writers of the American hinterlands, like Mexico's Juan Rulfo and Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa.</p> <p>Madariaga once awkwardly identified himself in a poem as \"beduin-gauchi-afro-hispano-guaran\u00ed\" (Bedouin-Gaucho-Afro-Hispanic-Guarani). Tall, skinny and striking, with a delightful laugh, he refused to join respectable Buenos Aires literary life. On another time when we met, in 1977, he was a night porter. This deliberately marginal stance was reflected in his devotion to a kind of poetry that could be loosely described as ethically surrealist, in that he never betrayed his poetic values, nor watered down his work for easy reading.</p> <p>He began publishing poems in 1943; his first collection, El peque\u00f1o pat\u00edbulo (Small Gallows), appeared in 1954, by which time his staccato and aphoristic constants were already evident. He followed this in 1960 with Las jaulas del sol (The Cages Of Sun), and in 1963 came El delito natal (Birth Crime). In 1973, there was, among others, Tembladerales de oro (Golden Quagmires), and he collected all his poems in El tren casi fluvial (The Almost Fluvial Train), which was published in Mexico and Argentina in 1987. His last book, in 1998, was Aroma de apariciones, (Aroma Of Appearances).</p> <p>Although he published continuously, Madariaga's total output was small, and exclusively poetic. He never col lected the chronicles of his travels, by canoe and horseback, around his beloved backlands. On a postcard to me, he once described his work as \"travel notes from canoes, trains and horses\".</p> <p>As well as celebrating the inaccessible Corrientes landscape, Madariaga evoked the way intense sensations - light, touch, smells, images - could be trapped in words without betraying them, a kind of sensual candour or erotic emotionalism. His short poem The Wood, translated by Anthony Edkins, captures this visionary energy:</p> <p>A pot <br>boiling blood <br>in winter. <br>Region where <br>red fire-drinking <br>whores urinate.</p> <p>Madariaga was a singer of love and women, and was anti-intellectual - or \"anti-verbal\", as he wrote in a poem. For him, the shock of direct experience with the world, when it matched his passionate imagination (or vice-versa), could not be analysed or controlled.</p> <p>His 1954 poem, The True Land, opens with a question: \"Is happiness elsewhere?\" and closes with a mandate:</p> <p>Virtuous drinker of the diamond's water, lie down <br> and rage at the giant globe of the idea. <br>This blood-drum is your land.</p> <p>Madariaga adapted surrealism to his own purposes, but did join forces with poets Enrique Molina and Aldo Pellegrini in 1952 to found a surrealist cell, with a magazine, A partir de cero (Starting from Zero), which denounced the philistine, neo-fascist, cultural policies of the then ruling Peronists and the cosmopolitan nostalgia of writers grouped around Victoria Ocampo's magazine, Sur.

      "trailText": "Private Lives: Next week... \"My dilemma is that my friends are married with children.\"",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I came from a hitherto close and loving family. In adult life I've enjoyed regular contact with my parents and two brothers and their families. However, 18 months ago, after 24 years of a dull and loveless marriage, with both children having left home, I left my husband.</p> <p>It was the best decision I could have made. I feel content, my confidence has returned and all my relationships have improved; except those with my family. My parents have curtailed all social contact and regard me with utter contempt and disappointment. They believe me to be selfish and immature for not \"sticking out\" my marriage. My brothers' reactions are identical because my husband was a \"decent guy who did nothing wrong\".</p> <p>I am indescribably hurt and feel terribly ashamed that at the age of 46 I can cry at being disapproved of and abandoned by my parents. Am I in the wrong? My judgment has been shot to pieces. How do I make amends?</p> <p><b> Keep your door open </b></p> <p>You have the same problem as my husband. His parents, too, are very loving to their children but firmly expect them still to be guided by their choices and values. This is deeply wrong. True love comes wrapped around with respect and support: respect that accepts you are the best person to decide what you do in your life, and support for when you make those decisions. Without these, your parents' love is cramping and controlling. But it is still love.</p> <p>I suspect most of the letters on this page will be telling you to dump your parents. You don't have to. Clearly your family is important to you and losing them is causing you deep pain. Keep any doors open that you can. Try to stay on friendly terms with them. Write to them. See if they would engage in family counselling. Above all, don't compromise your position and never think in terms of making amends. You've done nothing wrong. Your parents and brothers have, by refusing their support.</p> <p>Don't allow yourself to feel guilty. You did the right thing in leaving a loveless marriage and ultimately your parents may come to see that. Think about having counselling yourself to help your self-esteem which years of parental (and husband) control may have eroded. And enjoy your new life. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Carry on with your life</b></p> <p>I divorced 10 years ago for similar reasons to your own, but my children were younger. My parents' reaction was identical. They raged, initially, then cut me off completely, opting to support my ex-husband emotionally, financially and in any other way they could think of (including visiting their solicitor in a bid to somehow remove my children from me by claiming that I was an \"unfit mother\").</p> <p>I had no contact with them for two or three years until my mother became ill. This changed the situation somewhat. Suddenly I was needed. Like you, I had forged a happy, new life for myself. I had felt bitter towards my parents and had a struggle to overcome my feelings, but knew I would need to feel at ease with my conscience in the future, no matter what had happened, so my partner and I supported them through my mother's long illness and her death, three years ago.</p> <p>I have no regrets at all about my marriage break-up and, like you, love my life now. We do not have arranged marriages in our culture, and do not have to live our adult lives according to our parents' wishes. Carry on with your life and turn to the people who have supported you and love you for yourself and respect your decisions whether they agree with you or not.</p> <p>I wish you the very best of luck with your new life. You know you have done the right thing and that is what matters.<br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Continue to send gifts</b></p> <p>Many people stay in unhappy marriages because they haven't got the guts to get out and start afresh, and I deeply admire your courage.</p> <p>Don't take your parents' rejection so hard. Staying in a bad marriage for the sake of young children is fair enough, but doing so for the sake of elderly parents is plain silly. Their certitude of righteousness would be badly shaken if a close friend, or one of their precious sons, also got divorced, so wait and see what the future has in store. And as your parents become increasingly elderly, frail and dependent, they will realise that spurning a devoted and helpful daughter is a case of cutting off their noses to spite their faces.</p> <p>So be patient. In the meantime, steadfastly send cards and small presents to every one of your relatives for every birthday and Christmas as a non-intrusive way of telling them that you care. If their intransigence does not permit them to phone and say thank you, then maybe they are not such a great loss after all. Tell yourself that the alternative would have been to remain in a miserable marriage until the day one of you died. Best of luck. <br> <b> Claude Shields, Bucks</b></p> <p><b> Don't be pushed around</b></p> <p>It's time to grow up. Your parents and brothers don't approve. So what? Can they stop your pocket money? I'd avoid them all for six months. Don't give them a chance to bully you, because that's all it is, bullying. They rely on your coming back for more, like a little girl desperate for approval. Be very busy. If they do get a word in about your divorce, try a roll of the eyes, an \"Are you still harping on about THAT?\" and change the subject.</p> <p>Your own family, your adult kids, are your most important relationship, and they love and support you, so you know you've done right. You've let your birth family push you around for long enough. (I expect you've endured plenty of criticism, from how you do your hair to how you spaced your babies, all humiliatingly discussed in front of you.) As for making amends, well, look forward a few years. Who's going to be infirm and needing care? And who'll be expected to provide it? You, the \"girl\". If your parents carry on driving you away they'll have a lot of humble pie to eat. Ditch that overdeveloped conscience and LIVE. They'll respect you for it in the long run. <br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> It's the generation gap</b></p> <p>You don't need to \"make amends\" for your courage in ending a loveless marriage. But you've shaken up the people closest to you and it's easier for them to punish you than think about why they are so uncomfortable. Your parents' attitude arises from a combination of social conditioning and possibly also religious belief, and as such is probably non-negotiable. In their generation, the misery of men and women trapped in regretted, misconceived or abusive marriages was (presumably) made more bearable by the belief that \"sticking it out\" was the right thing to do.</p> <p>The harder (and much denied) truth you face is that love between parents and children is conditional after all - your parents can only accept a daughter they approve of, and that's no longer you. I hope you find the possibility always exists that they may grow to understand.</p> <p>As for your brothers, you have challenged them (and more alarmingly, their wives) to examine their own marriages. Most women work a lot harder than most men to sustain and nurture love, and what you have done today, your sisters-in-law may do tomorrow. Perhaps your treatment is meant as a deterrent! But the rift with your family is hard for you. I hope you find peace of mind.<br><b> Name and address withheld</b></p> <p><b> Next week</b></p> <p>A year ago my boyfriend and I ended our four-year relationship. Although I decided to call it a day, we continue to be on good terms. On the whole I feel positive about being single. Since my relationship ended I have developed a new network of friends and I have joined several societies.</p> <p>My dilemma is that many of my friends are married with children. I have found that if I wish to see them at the weekend, I have to make the arrangements. I appreciate that they are busy, but I wonder if it is worth inviting people round, who then never invite me back.</p> <p>Recently some friends were invited to a wedding at which my ex-boyfriend was the best man. I had known the groom from university and seen him frequently over the last four years, yet I did not receive an invitation. I was upset that some people who were happy to meet up with me when I was part of a couple no longer want to include me in their activities.</p> <p>I would like to meet more people of my own age (early 30s) who are single. My job involves working with people in their 40s and 50s, so I am unlikely to make friends through work.

The arts minister Alan Howarth yesterday took in its vast auditorium, with its cliff faces of Gothic tracery, medieval frescoes, stained glass, heraldic lions, griffins playing harps and foxes with trumpets, all under a Venetian coffered ceiling and said the picture palaces were part of everyone's heritage. The cinema was built for Sidney Bernstein, who called his chain Granada in memory of a Spanish holiday, and insisted \"people want architecture with marble columns, gilt and mirrors.\" His exotic interior designer, Theodore Komisarjevsky, a refugee White Russian prince, gave him all of those in spades. \"He really didn't know the meaning of the word excess,\" said Elain Harwood, English Heritage's expert on 20th century architecture.",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson last night sparked new controversy when he warned Ulster Unionists that they faced a regime of joint authority involving the Irish government if devolution failed again and there was another return to direct rule. Angry unionists saw his comments as inflammatory. Mr Mandelson's move came as the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was beginning a fresh fight for political survival after party dissidents demanded another meeting of the 860-strong ruling council. The outlook for the Good Friday agreement once more appears to be grim. Mr Mandelson gave several interviews in an attempt to shore up Mr Trimble, who is seen as key to the survival of the 30-month accord. He told Ulster Television that if the agreement fell, Ulster Unionists faced: \"possibly not even just direct rule, but both governments interfering directly in the affairs of Northern Ireland.\" Mr Trimble, who has been dismissive of the dissidents' move ahead of tomorrow's annual party conference, is expected to attempt to delay the council meeting until next month. He will then have a clearer picture of the government's plans on the policing bill, and will be able to determine tactics accordingly. Dissidents want to force Ulster Unionists out of the province's power-sharing executive, where they sit with Sinn Fein, until the IRA begins to decommission its weapons. The council meeting should take place three weeks after the 60 signatures demanding it were handed to party headquarters late on Wednesday. But procedural wrangling is under way, the aim of which is to buy Mr Trimble a little more breathing space. The Ulster Unionists' leader will test grassroots' opinion at tomorrow's conference. To once more unite the party and try to secure his position as leader, he may yet be forced to forward a motion himself at the subsequent council meeting to offer a timetable for withdrawal from the executive if there is no progress on IRA decommissioning. Mr Trimble, who will also face a Democratic Unionist motion of no confidence in his performance as Northern Ireland's first minister in the assembly on Monday, criticised the dissidents' move, and allies labelled it self-indulgent. He said that it was an attempt to upstage the party conference. There is little doubt the mood among Ulster Unionists is swinging against Mr Trimble, particularly after the party's catastrophic defeat to the DUP in the south Antrim byelection last month. His winning margin at successive ruling council meetings has narrowed, and is now in single figures. Dissidents claimed their move was about policy. They insisted no leadership challenge was intended. But Mr Trimble could hardly stay on if the hardliners forced a switch of his policies.

      "bodyText": "The Indonesian attorney general's office lodged an appeal yesterday against last week's court ruling that former president Suharto is too ill to stand trial for corruption. Muchtar Arifin, a prosecutor, said the appeal was based on the fact that in such a case it should be possible to try the accused in his absence, an option which the judges rejected when they dismissed the charges against Gen Surharto. Moreover, the judges did not take into account the widespread public demand for Gen Suharto to be brought to justice, he said. A panel of five judges dismissed the case after hearing detailed evidence from 23 court-appointed independent doctors that the defendant was too sick to stand trial and would never be healthy enough to do so. The decision sparked a day of violent running battles between protesters and the police in central Jakarta. President Abdurrahman Wahid, who was abroad at the time, said the judges were corrupt and that he would demand a retrial with \"clean\" officials. He also encouraged people to go to Gen Suharto's house and throw stones at the windows. After lodging the appeal papers at the high court in Jakarta, Mr Arifin said: \"A trial in absentia should be conducted because this is a special case. \"The presence of the defendant in court is not obligatory or an automatic right. It is a situation where he could appear to defend himself.\" He added that the appeal also argued that it was in the national interest for the case to proceed. Mr Wahid has made prosecuting his predecessor one of the planks of his reform agenda, but has promised to pardon him if he is convicted. With his public support waning and demands for Gen Suharto to be imprisoned mounting, it is becoming increasingly uncertain whether the extremely unpredictable president will keep his word. If the high court grants the appeal, a trail could begin very soon, according to Yushar Yahya, the attorney general's spokesman. \"It all depends on the judges, but there's no reason for a delay.\" Mr Suharto, 79, is charged with stealing about \u00a3400m from the state through seven charitable foundations he ran while president for 32 years until 1998. His critics, including Mr Wahid, believe his true wealth is in the tens of billions of pounds. The attorney general, Marzuki Darusman is also on the verge of imprisoning Mr Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo \"Tommy\" Mandala Putra, who earlier this week admitted his guilt in a corruption case but asked for a presidential pardon. Mr Darusman said he would order Tommy's arrest as soon as Mr Wahid, who said on Wednesday that he would not grant the pardon, signed the necessary papers.",

The Guardian's sister paper in Johannesburg, the Mail and Guardian, reports that Mr Mbeki painted a picture of an international plot against him to a meeting of 200 African National Congress cabinet ministers and MPs last week. The president said that criticism of his Aids policy was a foretaste of foreign attempts to undermine his government to protect the existing balance of economic power. He called on MPs to resist the campaign. Mr Mbeki said that his advisers were seeking to discover who was spreading the idea that he was \"deranged\", itself a part of the conspiracy against him. On Wednesday the ANC's national executive committee alleged that press criticism of Mr Mbeki was part of \"a massive propaganda onslaught against the ANC, its president and its government\". The government has begun a public relations offensive to deflect criticism of Mr Mbeki's Aids policy by focusing on his statement to parliament a fortnight ago that government policy was \"based on the the sis that HIV causes Aids\", and by admitting that he may have caused confusion. But Mr Mbeki angered some of his own MPs by once again raising the issue in private. He told them that because big western drug firms stood to benefit from treating HIV infections it was in their interests to insist that the virus was the cause of Aids. He then said that the CIA was actively promoting the belief that there was a link to protect the profits of companies making anti-retroviral drugs. But he said the CIA's campaign went further because it was also aimed at discrediting him as an effective voice for reform of a world economic order working at Washington's whim.

According to opinion polls, the extreme right, anti-immigration, Progress party has outstripped the ruling Labour party to become the most popular political force with this affluent country's 4.5m people. Its approval rating has soared as high as 35% and its charismatic leader, Carl Hagen - or \"King Carl\" - is being touted as the next prime minister. With less than a year to go before parliamentary elections are held, alarm bells are ringing and Norway's reputation as a tolerant society is under threat. The Progress party has won support by promising all things to all voters, and by promising to cut taxes and spend more of the country's oil revenue on improving the welfare state. It also wants to bundle the elderly off to Spain, where health care is cheaper. As the party has become more popular, Mr Hagen has done his best to rein in some of its more outspoken members and play down its hardline immigration policies. But his most radical ideas are unchanged. The party's manifesto advocates abolishing development aid to the third world because, it says, the money is spent on \"arms and luxury goods\" for the elite.

A maximum of 1,000 immigrants a year would be allowed, and asylum seekers who broke Norwegian law would be repatriated. The party also wants a national referendum on whether any more foreigners at all should be admitted - Norway has about 250,000 - and it is keen to test new arrivals for Aids. The party is compared by some to Austria's far-right Freedom party and France's National Front, but it insists that it is not racist. \"We're a new political breed,\" says the silver-haired, rather portly, Mr Hagen, sitting in his smart office in the parliament building in Oslo. \"We combine the best from social democratic thinking and the best from conservative thinking.\" Norwegian society is under attack, he warns, and too many immigrants will spark social unrest. \"Let's not be naive and blue-eyed.

The situation is ready to explode.\"</p> <p>The soul-searching has its mirror image among Israeli Jews. But their conclusions are profoundly, and disturbingly, different. Across the political spectrum, few Israeli Jews doubt that the army had any choice but to open fire on Israeli Arab protesters, and they believe that Arab members of parliament played a huge part in provoking the violence.</p> <p>Israeli Arabs see this week's violence as an explosion by a community torn between sympathy for its Palestinian cousins and its situation in Israel. Palestinians who chose citizenship rather than exile when Israel was created, and their descendants, make up 18% of Israel's population.</p> <p>Although they are far better off economically than those in Palestinian-controlled areas they suffer systematic discrimination in jobs, schools, housing and social services.</p> <p>Since 1948 no new Arab town has been built in Israel, and until this year Arabs were legally barred from buying land and building homes in much of Israel. Their towns are crowded and dirty. Much of their traditional landhas been confiscated by the army and kibbutzim and for the controversial road now being built which will slice through the centre of Israel.</p> <p>In Galilee the frustration was brought to the boil earlier this year when a speeding Arab motorist was shot and wounded by an Israeli police chief. Arabs say the police chief is racist; the Israeli authorities have refused to transfer him.</p> <p>Such nuances are lost on most Israeli Jews, who see this week's explosion as sheer treachery, and criticise the prime minister Ehud Barak's attempt to bring reconciliation as pandering to an uppity minority.</p> <p>The liberal newspaper Ha'aretz said in a commentary yesterday: \"What is taking place in the streets of Arab towns and neighbourhoods is - why should we continue to deny the fact - a revolt. A revolt against the Jewish majority in whose midst they live, and a revolt against the very democracy in which they are citizens.\"</p> <p>The divide is an accurate expression of the way the two peoples live. Few Jews have Arab friends; there are only two or three experimental schools where the children of both communities study together. In their segregated neighbourhoods in such cities as Haifa and Accre, the two communities live separate existences.</p> <p>Still, many thought they were making progress. At last year's elections many Israeli Arabs voted Mr Barak. They believed he was sympathetic towards the campaign for equality, which has been gaining momentum for the past five years.</p> <p>Many thought the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had put the days of confrontation behind them, and that the growing prosperity from Israel's hi-tech boom would gently erase the other frictions.</p> <p>\"I never voted. I never demonstrated. I did not want to raise my kids with this stupidity: should you be an Israeli, or should you be an Arab,\" Mrs Zidan said. . \"I thought I could put the whole question in a drawer.\"</p> <p>This protests have shaken that belief. So did her conversations with Jewish acquaintances, which convinced her that a wall had gone up between them.</p> <p>\"I thought that this week was the maximum, that things could get no worse,\" shesaid. \"But now I really think Israelis have a psychological problem of denial. I live in a Jewish neighbourhood, and they just do not see me.\" She corrected herself: \"They don't see us, and we don't see them.\"</p> <p><b>Burden of inequality</b></p> <p><b> The law</b></p> <p>\u0095Israel grants automatic citizenship and residency to Jews under the law of return, but not to non-Jews</p> <p>\u0095The Jewish National Fund, which owns or administers most of the land, bars its sale or lease to non-Jews</p> <p><b> Housing</b></p> <p>\u0095No Arab town has been built since Israel was proclaimed in 1948.

With a few key strokes the lives of mother and daughter were changed forever. \"A 15-year-old suddenly realised we are two nations who hate each other, and that the other one can suddenly kill her friend,\" Mrs Zidan said yesterday. The protests by Israeli Arabs which have convulsed the Arab heartland, Galilee, and penetrated mixed areas of Tel Aviv and Haifa, led to the worst ethnic violence in Israel since the state was created in 1948. Perhaps no death captures the feelings of betrayal and despair that have engulfed Israelis - Arabs and Jews - more than that of Sukina's chatroom friend, Asil Asleh. For an Arab teenager Asleh, 17, had an unheard-of circle of Jewish friends, whom she met through Seeds of Peace, an American summer camp for Jewish and Arab teenagers. His father, who described his death yesterday to a hushed crowd of Israeli Arab activists trying to make sense of these bloody days, says he was first beaten by soldiers and then shot in the neck. His audience, professionals mainly, Hebrew speakers and veterans of peace and human rights organisations, have had their dream of co-existence between Israeli Arabs and Jews destroyed by the security forces' killing of Asleh and 10 others. It is also raising uncomfortable questions about the effectiveness of decades of peaceful efforts to secure equal rights for Israel's Arab minority. \"Something very urgent has happened in relation with the state of Israel and our Arab citizens of Israel,\" said Mohammed Zidan, who heads a human rights organisation in Nazareth. \"Even if there will be an agreement in the West Bank and Gaza, if there is no solution dealing with the Palestinians in Israel there will never be a real peace. The situation is ready to explode.\" The soul-searching has its mirror image among Israeli Jews. But their conclusions are profoundly, and disturbingly, different. Across the political spectrum, few Israeli Jews doubt that the army had any choice but to open fire on Israeli Arab protesters, and they believe that Arab members of parliament played a huge part in provoking the violence. Israeli Arabs see this week's violence as an explosion by a community torn between sympathy for its Palestinian cousins and its situation in Israel. Palestinians who chose citizenship rather than exile when Israel was created, and their descendants, make up 18% of Israel's population. Although they are far better off economically than those in Palestinian-controlled areas they suffer systematic discrimination in jobs, schools, housing and social services. Since 1948 no new Arab town has been built in Israel, and until this year Arabs were legally barred from buying land and building homes in much of Israel. Their towns are crowded and dirty. Much of their traditional landhas been confiscated by the army and kibbutzim and for the controversial road now being built which will slice through the centre of Israel. In Galilee the frustration was brought to the boil earlier this year when a speeding Arab motorist was shot and wounded by an Israeli police chief. Arabs say the police chief is racist; the Israeli authorities have refused to transfer him. Such nuances are lost on most Israeli Jews, who see this week's explosion as sheer treachery, and criticise the prime minister Ehud Barak's attempt to bring reconciliation as pandering to an uppity minority. The liberal newspaper Ha'aretz said in a commentary yesterday: \"What is taking place in the streets of Arab towns and neighbourhoods is - why should we continue to deny the fact - a revolt. A revolt against the Jewish majority in whose midst they live, and a revolt against the very democracy in which they are citizens.\" The divide is an accurate expression of the way the two peoples live. Few Jews have Arab friends; there are only two or three experimental schools where the children of both communities study together. In their segregated neighbourhoods in such cities as Haifa and Accre, the two communities live separate existences. Still, many thought they were making progress. At last year's elections many Israeli Arabs voted Mr Barak. They believed he was sympathetic towards the campaign for equality, which has been gaining momentum for the past five years. Many thought the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had put the days of confrontation behind them, and that the growing prosperity from Israel's hi-tech boom would gently erase the other frictions. \"I never voted. I never demonstrated. I did not want to raise my kids with this stupidity: should you be an Israeli, or should you be an Arab,\" Mrs Zidan said. . \"I thought I could put the whole question in a drawer.\" This protests have shaken that belief. So did her conversations with Jewish acquaintances, which convinced her that a wall had gone up between them. \"I thought that this week was the maximum, that things could get no worse,\" shesaid. \"But now I really think Israelis have a psychological problem of denial. I live in a Jewish neighbourhood, and they just do not see me.\" She corrected herself: \"They don't see us, and we don't see them.\" Burden of inequality The law \u0095Israel grants automatic citizenship and residency to Jews under the law of return, but not to non-Jews \u0095The Jewish National Fund, which owns or administers most of the land, bars its sale or lease to non-Jews Housing \u0095No Arab town has been built since Israel was proclaimed in 1948. So far this year Israel has refused 22,000 building permits for Arab citizens \u0095Arabs are ineligible for 62.4% of housing ministry grants for buying flats, and ineligible for 68.7% of the budget for rent aid. In 1995, 2.3% of Arab applicants were granted mortgages Social spending \u0095Arab poverty and infant mortality rates are double those of the Jewish population \u0095Per capita expenditure on Arab towns is one-seventh of that for Jewish towns Jobs The unemployment rate is 14% for Arabs, 9.5% for Jews. The average hourly wage is 33%higher for Jewish men than for Arab men \u0095Arabs do not serve in the army, so lack security clearance to work in companies with defence contracts and many areas of hi-tech industry \u0095About 2,800 of the government's 50,000 employees are Arabs, and 25 of its 2,400 senior staff Education \u0095In 1998, 40 of the 5,000 university professorships were held by Arabs \u0095About 10% of Arab graduates work as drivers, waiters or unskilled labourers compared with 3% of Jews",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Something far wider and deeper than the English Channel separates the British from the French. It is a chasm of mutual incomprehension. Consider the French poster for Maybe Baby, the pregnancy comedy based on Ben Elton's novel, which is released in Paris next Wednesday. Below a Union Jack, Hugh Laurie lies in bed with a look that may be pre- or post-orgasmic, but either way suggests that he is very excited. Next to him is Joely Richardson who, let's hope, is ovulating. The poster's caption tells the real story: \"Comment les Anglais se Reproduisent\" (How the English Reproduce).</p> <p> It's a statement that needs only a question mark to sum up the mystification many French people feel about the English - especially with regard to sex. How do the English reproduce? Maybe Baby's marketing strategy shows how strange those people north of Calais really appear to the French. In Britain the film was sold simply as a comedy about trying to conceive; in France, if the film has any chances of doing good box office at all, it needs to be promoted as a curio about the curious English. Historically the French have had a hard time taking British cinema seriously. Cinema was invented in France and became a national obsession; the British never embraced the art form with the gusto that they brought to theatre and literature. At least, that is the received wisdom in France.</p> <p> This issue was taken up this week in the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration: \"The French have for a long time misunderstood the films made by their neighbours across the Channel. Without doubt this is the fault of Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, who once said that British cinema was 'a contradiction in terms'.\" According to French director Bertrand Tavernier, \"that phrase has been repeated everywhere. For 40 years it has been the basis for French critics' perspectives.\" Now more than ever, then, it is time for the French to receive an education in British film. And a five-month season of movies called Typiquement British at the Pompidou centre launched this week provides just that. </p> <p>From now until March, more than 200 films will be shown at the centre. There will be six films screened each day in two cinemas, including a huge Redgrave dynasty section (though not including Joely's latest performance in Maybe Baby). \"Familiar but relatively unknown, a large proportion of British cinema is yet to be discovered in France,\" says the press release for the season. \"And,\" one feels like adding, \"in Britain.\" Because one of the striking things about the Typiquement season is that it is unlikely that such a lavish festival would be staged in Britain. France, by contrast, still has a passion for films from outside the US blockbuster mainstream that puts our cinema to shame.</p> <p> When did you last see some of those wonderful wartime Humphrey Jennings documentaries like London Can Take It or Fires Were Started? How many British film-goers even know what Free Cinema is, still less have savoured Leslie Daiken's One Potato Two Potato from 1957? When did you last see a Ken McMullen film? You know, one of the arty auteur's pictures from the 80s such as Ghost Dance - a picture that brought together roly-poly funnyman Robbie Coltrane and deconstructionist doyen Jacques Derrida for the first time, though let us hope not the last. Typiquement British, which includes all these films as well as programmes of avant-garde cinema alongside box-office triumphs such as the Full Monty, would give anyone an excellent education in British film. It would be rather harder to get such a film education in Britain. Yes, the Typiquement British season was programmed in collaboration with the British Film Institute and the British Council. But still: wouldn't it be extraordinary if a five-month season of British films, including historical oddities alongside box-office triumphs, came to a cinema near you?</p> <p> Maybe we, rather than the French, underestimate British cinema. Indeed, for all French hand-wringing about how they misunderstand British film, the French watch a great deal of it. \"This country [Britain] is the most hostile to British cinema of any country in the world,\" said Simon Perry, head of British Screen. \"So many of our films do well in France. It's the largest market in the world for British films. Our films do well in the US, Japan, and the rest of Europe. Britain is a permanent problem.\" </p> <p>Moreover, British films are often treated with greater respect in France than at home. When Ken Loach's film Land and Freedom was released in 1993, it was shown in only 59 cinemas in Britain. In France it was shown in 150. The symbolism is potent: why would a British-made picture about a Scouse volunteer during the Spanish civil war made by one of the few great directors the UK has produced in recent years be a bigger draw across the Channel than at home? Two answers. According to Stephen Frears: \"Everybody knows that English people like escapist Hollywood films.\" This was one of the things that made the success of Frears' 1985 film My Beautiful Laundrette so extraordinary. Peter Mullan, Cannes-winning actor for his performance in Ken Loach's My Name is Joe, argues that the problem is partly due to Hollywood bullying the cinemas: \"If you're told you're going to have to take these four films if you're going to get Titanic, how do you fight against that?\" </p> <p>Mullan and Frears were talking during a documentary called Le Cin\u00e9ma Britannique shown last week on French TV. One of the questions that preoccupied me when I watched the programme was how well British films, which often have remarkably parochial frames of reference, transfer to other countries. Think of that scene in Loach's Raining Stones where Ricky Tomlinson and the rest of his dole-ite scallies try to dig up the turf from a Conservative Club bowling green. How could the political resonance of that scene be understood in France? British filmgoers are themselves resistant to certain French films. Thus, Les Visiteurs may have been the biggest French box-office sensation ever, but it did poorly in Britain. Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut du Bien, a comedy that has held Hollywood releases at bay for most of the summer, will hardly have the same effect when it reaches British screens. For British film fans there is a contradiction between \"French\" and \"comedy\". No, what British audiences want from French films is something stylish and sexy like L'Appartement, something well-tailored and sexy like Nelly et M Arnaud, something verbose and sexy like most of Eric Rohmer's films, something challenging and sexy like Catherine Breillat's Romance, or something with B\u00e9atrice Dalle, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art or Isabelle Adjani in next to no clothes. </p> <p>Films that smell like Gauloises and are as apparently authentic as a croissant dipped in a caf\u00e9 allong\u00e9. French films fulfil a fetishistic function for many Britons. The exception that proves the rule is Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine, about three tough kids in a Parisian council estate. To see that film was to realise the similarities between French and British societies; most of the time, though, the markets for each other's films are often based on exaggerating the differences. But at least French cinefiles have been given a historical frame of reference for British films to help them understand that miserablism.</p> <p> Le Cin\u00e9ma Britannique was formidable in trying to tell a story of British film's development. According to French - no, not the French, but Philip French, the Observer's film critic - Margaret Thatcher was the catalyst that sparked a British film renaissance. She both scuppered financial support for British cinema and gave it its subject matter. Maybe the answer is that the French care about film more than the British. Truffaut famously asked rhetorically: \"Is the cinema more important than life?\" The answer, evidently, was \"Yes\". Indeed he went on to say: \"I have always preferred the reflection of the life to life itself.\" For good or ill, there aren't many Britons one could imagine making the same remark. </p> <p> <strong>The crossover</strong><br></p> <p><strong> That Riviera Touch</strong> (1966). Filmed in France, would Eric and Ernie's latterday Laurel and Hardy double act really find a place in French bosoms? Sadly not. </p> <p><strong> Henry V</strong> (1944/1989). The French don't care to be reminded of military reverses - particularly as they haven't won a significant military engagement since Austerlitz. </p> <p><strong> Are You Being Served?</strong> (1977). The French public didn't dig Mrs Slocombe's pussy, even though \"double entendre\" is a French expression. </p> <p><strong> Secrets and Lies </strong> (1996). Mike Leigh's Cannes-winning film captured dysfunctional British eccentrics in a manner that appealed to Gallic viewers. </p> <p><strong> Land and Freedom</strong> (1995). Ken Loach's Spanish civil war drama with a British protagonist (Ian Hart) was more popular in France than at home. </p> <p><strong> Tom Jones</strong> (1963). Tony Richardson's film bombed in London, and only after it was a triumph in France did it go on to box-office success in Britain and at the Oscars. </p> <p><strong> Les Visiteurs</strong> (1993). Medieval nobleman and squire transported to modern times by senile sorcerer. Funnier than it sounds. But, to the British, not much. </p> <p><strong> Taxi</strong> (1998) Daniel becomes a taxi driver. Caught speeding, he agrees to help a cop hunting bank robbers. There was a sequel, but you seem to have lost interest already. </p> <p><strong> Le D\u00eener de Cons</strong> (1998). Each week Pierre and his smug mates organise a party to which they bring the thickest chump they can find. Hilarious consequences ensue. </p> <p><strong> Cyrano de Bergerac</strong> (1990). Big-conked poet falls for Roxanne. She is seduced by his letters but believes them to have been from gorgeous Christiane. Dommage! </p> <p><strong> Manon des Sources</strong> (1986). Peter Mayle's Provence in period dress, with Emmanuelle B\u00e9art seething gorgeously about the death of her father. Couldn't fail. </p> <p><strong> L'Appartement</strong> (1996). A film of Hitchockian joy in analysing voyeurism, it was also stylish, sexy and Parisian. Catching the Eurostar has never seemed so appealing. </p> <p> \u0095 Typiquement British runs until March 4 2001 at the Pompidou Centre, Paris. Tel: 0033 1 44781233</p>",

There will be six films screened each day in two cinemas, including a huge Redgrave dynasty section (though not including Joely's latest performance in Maybe Baby). \"Familiar but relatively unknown, a large proportion of British cinema is yet to be discovered in France,\" says the press release for the season. \"And,\" one feels like adding, \"in Britain.\" Because one of the striking things about the Typiquement season is that it is unlikely that such a lavish festival would be staged in Britain. France, by contrast, still has a passion for films from outside the US blockbuster mainstream that puts our cinema to shame. When did you last see some of those wonderful wartime Humphrey Jennings documentaries like London Can Take It or Fires Were Started? How many British film-goers even know what Free Cinema is, still less have savoured Leslie Daiken's One Potato Two Potato from 1957? When did you last see a Ken McMullen film? You know, one of the arty auteur's pictures from the 80s such as Ghost Dance - a picture that brought together roly-poly funnyman Robbie Coltrane and deconstructionist doyen Jacques Derrida for the first time, though let us hope not the last. Typiquement British, which includes all these films as well as programmes of avant-garde cinema alongside box-office triumphs such as the Full Monty, would give anyone an excellent education in British film. It would be rather harder to get such a film education in Britain. Yes, the Typiquement British season was programmed in collaboration with the British Film Institute and the British Council. But still: wouldn't it be extraordinary if a five-month season of British films, including historical oddities alongside box-office triumphs, came to a cinema near you? Maybe we, rather than the French, underestimate British cinema. Indeed, for all French hand-wringing about how they misunderstand British film, the French watch a great deal of it. \"This country [Britain] is the most hostile to British cinema of any country in the world,\" said Simon Perry, head of British Screen. \"So many of our films do well in France. It's the largest market in the world for British films. Our films do well in the US, Japan, and the rest of Europe. Britain is a permanent problem.\" Moreover, British films are often treated with greater respect in France than at home. When Ken Loach's film Land and Freedom was released in 1993, it was shown in only 59 cinemas in Britain. In France it was shown in 150. The symbolism is potent: why would a British-made picture about a Scouse volunteer during the Spanish civil war made by one of the few great directors the UK has produced in recent years be a bigger draw across the Channel than at home? Two answers. According to Stephen Frears: \"Everybody knows that English people like escapist Hollywood films.\" This was one of the things that made the success of Frears' 1985 film My Beautiful Laundrette so extraordinary. Peter Mullan, Cannes-winning actor for his performance in Ken Loach's My Name is Joe, argues that the problem is partly due to Hollywood bullying the cinemas: \"If you're told you're going to have to take these four films if you're going to get Titanic, how do you fight against that?\" Mullan and Frears were talking during a documentary called Le Cin\u00e9ma Britannique shown last week on French TV. One of the questions that preoccupied me when I watched the programme was how well British films, which often have remarkably parochial frames of reference, transfer to other countries. Think of that scene in Loach's Raining Stones where Ricky Tomlinson and the rest of his dole-ite scallies try to dig up the turf from a Conservative Club bowling green. How could the political resonance of that scene be understood in France? British filmgoers are themselves resistant to certain French films. Thus, Les Visiteurs may have been the biggest French box-office sensation ever, but it did poorly in Britain. Harry, Un Ami Qui Vous Veut du Bien, a comedy that has held Hollywood releases at bay for most of the summer, will hardly have the same effect when it reaches British screens. For British film fans there is a contradiction between \"French\" and \"comedy\". No, what British audiences want from French films is something stylish and sexy like L'Appartement, something well-tailored and sexy like Nelly et M Arnaud, something verbose and sexy like most of Eric Rohmer's films, something challenging and sexy like Catherine Breillat's Romance, or something with B\u00e9atrice Dalle, Emmanuelle B\u00e9art or Isabelle Adjani in next to no clothes. Films that smell like Gauloises and are as apparently authentic as a croissant dipped in a caf\u00e9 allong\u00e9. French films fulfil a fetishistic function for many Britons. The exception that proves the rule is Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine, about three tough kids in a Parisian council estate. To see that film was to realise the similarities between French and British societies; most of the time, though, the markets for each other's films are often based on exaggerating the differences. But at least French cinefiles have been given a historical frame of reference for British films to help them understand that miserablism. Le Cin\u00e9ma Britannique was formidable in trying to tell a story of British film's development. According to French - no, not the French, but Philip French, the Observer's film critic - Margaret Thatcher was the catalyst that sparked a British film renaissance. She both scuppered financial support for British cinema and gave it its subject matter. Maybe the answer is that the French care about film more than the British. Truffaut famously asked rhetorically: \"Is the cinema more important than life?\" The answer, evidently, was \"Yes\". Indeed he went on to say: \"I have always preferred the reflection of the life to life itself.\" For good or ill, there aren't many Britons one could imagine making the same remark. The crossover That Riviera Touch (1966). Filmed in France, would Eric and Ernie's latterday Laurel and Hardy double act really find a place in French bosoms? Sadly not. Henry V (1944/1989). The French don't care to be reminded of military reverses - particularly as they haven't won a significant military engagement since Austerlitz. Are You Being Served? (1977). The French public didn't dig Mrs Slocombe's pussy, even though \"double entendre\" is a French expression. Secrets and Lies (1996). Mike Leigh's Cannes-winning film captured dysfunctional British eccentrics in a manner that appealed to Gallic viewers. Land and Freedom (1995). Ken Loach's Spanish civil war drama with a British protagonist (Ian Hart) was more popular in France than at home. Tom Jones (1963). Tony Richardson's film bombed in London, and only after it was a triumph in France did it go on to box-office success in Britain and at the Oscars. Les Visiteurs (1993). Medieval nobleman and squire transported to modern times by senile sorcerer. Funnier than it sounds. But, to the British, not much. Taxi (1998) Daniel becomes a taxi driver. Caught speeding, he agrees to help a cop hunting bank robbers. There was a sequel, but you seem to have lost interest already. Le D\u00eener de Cons (1998). Each week Pierre and his smug mates organise a party to which they bring the thickest chump they can find. Hilarious consequences ensue. Cyrano de Bergerac (1990). Big-conked poet falls for Roxanne. She is seduced by his letters but believes them to have been from gorgeous Christiane. Dommage! Manon des Sources (1986). Peter Mayle's Provence in period dress, with Emmanuelle B\u00e9art seething gorgeously about the death of her father. Couldn't fail. L'Appartement (1996). A film of Hitchockian joy in analysing voyeurism, it was also stylish, sexy and Parisian. Catching the Eurostar has never seemed so appealing. \u0095 Typiquement British runs until March 4 2001 at the Pompidou Centre, Paris. Tel: 0033 1 44781233",

All the signs were promising: trailers - which ran over a year before Payback's release - suggested Mel was getting ready to play the evillest bastard essayed by a major star in years.

Out went nasty Mel, in came scenes superimposed (as subtly as a smelly foot surgically grafted on to the forehead) to suggest that the murdering pig actually had a heart of gold. If you saw the original trailers and the final version, you might have been surprised: Point Blank's Angie Dickinson was the villain in the first version, but she was nowhere to be seen after the clean-up job.

Sly will do his usual beefcake in extremis, action-bozo shtick - Cop Land aside, he seems capable of little else - and precious little history will be made.

      "body": "<p><strong> Day 1: meeting the press</strong> <br></p> <p> It is three years since I last saw Terence Davies. His mother had just died, and he was in despair, and he'd tell anyone who stopped long enough to ask how he was. He couldn't see the point of going on. Actually, he looked as if he'd already given up. </p> <p>So it's hard to recognise the man lapping up the limelight on stage at New York's Lincoln Center. Physically he looks the same - the campest accountant you'll ever meet. It's his demeanour that has changed. An American journalist in the post-screening audience says: \"Meeting you here, you seem like the life of the party. Why don't you do an Ealing-style movie next time?\" Davies, who has made two of the most miserable and beautiful films in cinema history, licks his lips. \"I'd love to,\" he says, \"but having a good sense of humour isn't the same as being able to write comedy.\" This most English of Englishmen is revelling in the cerebral glitz of Manhattan. </p> <p>It's 12 years since Davies came to prominence with Distant Voices, Still Lives. The film was autobiographical, documenting the love with which his mother and nine siblings survived his father's brutality. As with all Davies's films, the images haunt you for ever, notably the father, played by Pete Postlethwaite, ripping away the tablecloth, and Christmas dinner with it - a silent, terrifying assault. </p> <p>Distant Voices, Still Lives was the second instalment of Davies's Liverpool life. The first, his rarely shown Trilogy, is made up of three short movies and is equally brilliant, equally unbearable. The Trilogy shows the young man trying, and failing, to come to terms with his homosexuality. Again, the images glue themselves to mind and soul - the solitary woman on the bus who breaks down and cries till there's nothing left; the father, played by Wilfrid \"Steptoe\" Brambell, coughing himself to death in a wordless scene that seems to last for ever. With these films Davies quietly reinvented cinema. The camera barely moved, the actors barely acted - they were more like living photographs than movies. </p> <p>After a six-year absence Davies is back with his fifth film, an adaptation of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, and the New York journalists are stunned by what they have just seen. Yes, this period piece is a conventional film - a radical departure for Davies - but it is a savage take on New York society in the early 20th century. </p> <p>It's a perfect film for a New York audience - after all, it is set in the city, though it was actually shot in Glasgow because it was so much cheaper. But it's still astonishing to find Davies here, feted wherever he goes. It was surprising enough when the abused child grew into a man who managed to hold down a job for so many years; even more surprising when he gave it all up to make his art-house movies. Now here he is, unable to move for Oscar talk, explaining how he turned Gillian Anderson, one of today's biggest television stars, into a formidable film actor. He may resist the idea, but, as he tells the world's press why he adapted Wharton's novel and they hang on his every word, he's on the cusp of the big time. </p> <p>\"What is extraordinary about the book is its modernity,\" he says. \"It's about the destruction of one person by a social class, it's about how much money you've got, what you look like - and what is modern society about if not how much money you've got and what you look like?\" </p> <p>When Lily Bart, the heroine played by Anderson, refuses to marry for money and fails to salvage her reputation by ruining that of the man she loves, she is destroyed. </p> <p>He is asked why he chose Anderson. Davies looks a little sheepish as he embarks on a typical story. \"When I cast her I hadn't seen The X Files and still haven't because I don't watch television except for the news and some documentaries. I was looking for faces that looked like the Singer Sargent portraits of the belle \u00e9poque , and I said, 'That is a John Singer Sargent face, who is she?'\" Davies invited her over for a pot of tea, as he does, and it turned out that the American celebrity knew all about the obscure British film-maker. \"Apparently, she was a fan. She told me she had seen The Long Day Closes and had cried at the tracking shot over the carpet.\" </p> <p>In The Long Day Closes, Davies's father finally dies, he discovers movies, the family discovers peace, and for four years he embraces life ecstatically. Davies's tracking shot is perhaps his most distinctive trait: the camera languorously glides over a carpet, a cinema audience, the Atlantic ocean. The technique is self-indulgent, audacious and gorgeous. </p> <p>The great worry about Terence Davies - one of the great worries about him - was that once he had exhausted his family life, there would be nothing left. He says he knew he had to escape his own history. Technically, he did this with his last film, The Neon Bible, but even here the boy with his tender misery was little more than an American version of young Terry. </p> <p>\"When you mine your own seam, you also destroy it,\" he says. \"There's a point where you become repetitive - there's nothing else to say. My great love is Eliot's Four Quartets and these were my modest version of the Four Quartets, based on the suffering of myself and my own family.\" </p> <p> <strong> Day 2: on the road</strong> <br></p> <p> We're in a yellow cab on the way to a radio interview. Davies and his PR, Mark, are trying to outcamp each other. Mark stares at a huge billboard advert for Tommy Hilfiger - a male model in nothing but his six-pack and underpants. \"It's very popular, that advert in New York,\" Mark says. \"I bet it is! I can imagine,\" Davies answers. </p> <p>Mark tells him The House of Mirth has just been reviewed in Newsweek - three and a half stars. \"Is that good?\" Davies asks. \"Three and a half out of four. We're doing OK.\" </p> <p>Davies disappears into a tiny booth. He's talking about modernity again, the way that the greatest dramas always remain contemporary. \"Because they touch on basic human terrors. We could be Medea saying to Jason, 'If you leave me, I'll kill the children.' Horrific though it is, we can understand that possessive love. Believe me, I understand possessive love.\" </p> <p>Davies left school when he was 15, qualified for little but victimhood. After the four years of bliss following his father's death, he went on to secondary school where he was bullied constantly. His voice is smoky, seductive, with little trace of Liverpool. For some reason, he says, at school he started to talk like the Queen Mother. When he left, he worked as an unqualified accountant for 12 years. He hates the fact that he had the pedantic, quibbling mind to be a good accountant. He also trained and worked as an actor for many of those years. He knew, though, that he didn't have the physical appeal to become a huge success. Davies complains that he looks like an avocado. </p> <p>\"I'd give anything to be really good-looking and have a wonderful body and be really stupid,\" he says. \"It's an unbeatable combo.\" </p> <p>The radio presenter makes the inevitable comparison with Martin Scorsese, who also adapted a Wharton book, The Age of Innocence. Davies protests. \"Martin Scorsese is a huge name! I'm not a huge name. I go into a room full of people and I'm the only person I've not heard of. I think his film is a masterpiece. There are shots I would die for.\" He describes one, and looks as if he's about to explode with enthusiasm. </p> <p>\"God, it's ravishing. I don't feel in the same class as Martin Scorsese. Although I must say I met him when he came to London. He invited me to dinner, which was so charming. So charming . And he's got a very good sense of humour. I said, 'What's your next film?' He said it was about the Dalai Lama, and I said, 'What are you going to call it, Hello Dalai?' And he said, 'No, Raging Lama!' \" Davies dissolves into hysterics, as does the presenter. </p> <p>\"First you make me cry, now you're making me laugh,\" she says. \"You're making me forget everything.\" \"It's a gift,\" Davies says. He's turned into No\u00ebl Coward. The pair of them are flirting like crazy inside their tiny booth. </p> <p>We're walking along Sixth Avenue towards his hotel. Davies is talking about how American musicals and the Ealing comedies influenced him. I ask him whether he's joking about the comedies. No, he says. Of course not. </p> <p>Earlier in the day he had said how churlish the English could be, and cited the saying \"too clever by half\" as an example. I wonder what his family makes of the man who finds it hard to open his mouth without quoting Shakespeare or Keats or TS Eliot. Do they call him too clever by half? \"No. They're terribly proud of me, as I'm proud of them. But they think this life is glamour, and it's not. Why should I spoil it for them, though?\" When his mother was alive they'd speak to each other every day at 6pm. \"If I was somewhere like here, I'd phone up and say, 'Guess where I am, Mum? New York.' And she'd say, 'You're not !'\" He smiles. </p> <p>When he made Distant Voices, Still Lives it was tough on the family. Some of his brothers and sisters felt he was wrong to expose his father, that it was private business. \"But my mum just said, 'He's told the truth.' Which was pretty fantastic. She was a pretty fantastic woman. She had no bitterness in her.\" </p> <p>Davies was only six and a half when his father, a rag and bone man, died, but he says those few years damaged him for life. \"I'm still acutely aware of atmosphere in a room. When I was a kid I'd run into a room and if he didn't want anyone around, he'd just kick me from one end of the house to the other. You don't make that mistake very often.\" </p> <p>Did he ever think his father would kill him? \"No. What was terrifying was the silences, and the cruelty that was in the air. Then it would all start again. I thought he'd kill my mum because on one occasion he just picked up an axe. My eldest sister hit him over the head with a milk bottle. I didn't want her to die. I thought, 'What would I do if she died?'\" </p> <p>Every day he feels the influence of his father - in his relationship with other people. \"The damage that is done when you're a child is so long-lasting. Especially having your self-esteem taken away. You can never regain it. I feel inferior to most men, especially if they've got good bodies and are good-looking. I really feel inferior, and I have to say I'm full of jealousy.\" </p> <p>He says he regards his homosexuality as a curse. \"I loathe it. It's ruined my life, and I wish I were normal and ordinary. I'm no good at sex anyway.\" He is celibate and says he has long forsaken the dream of a boyfriend and stable domestic gay life. His guilt was compounded by his Catholicism. \"On one occasion I prayed until my knees bled.\" At 22 he rejected Catholicism as a lie. </p> <p>But if Terence Davies seems miserable now, that is just one side of him. He feels joy as intensely as despair. When he talks about Shostakovich, Brahms, poetry, or the \"women's films\" he loves, or the paintings of Vermeer and the magical way that light falls on a window, he is transported. </p> <p>Laura Linney, who also stars in The House Of Mirth, says: \"He is the most passionate person I have ever met. He has enormous passion for his work, his life, his likes, his dislikes.\" </p> <p>I tell him how great it's been to see him so upbeat in public. Yes, he says, it's been a successful trip, it's been lovely seeing old friends and, yes, he does get enormous pleasure from so many things. He qualifies himself. He says he knows, just knows, some small thing will happen in the next few days to ruin it all. \"I tell you. I'll see something that in anybody else would just not matter and it will make me feel so depressed, someone crossing the street or an old person not being helped or something, and that's it - the veil falls from life and you see what lies behind it, and it's absolute terror.\" </p> <p>Sometimes his own words seem to bring on another bout of nausea. He says he's aware of what he's trying to achieve when he tells people about his life, about the wounds. \"I'm saying, 'Love me, love me; like me, like me.' And at 55, there's something really rather tawdry about that. It's adolescent, for God's sake.\" </p> <p> <strong> Day 3: the premiere</strong> <br></p> <p> The fans are milling outside the Lincoln Center. Fans of Gillian Anderson, fans of The X Files, fans of Edith Wharton. There may well even be a few Terence Davies fans somewhere. One elderly woman tells me she's waiting to see Anderson. \"She's an actress, isn't she? They told me she'd be here tonight. I've never seen her before.\" Security refuse to let me in. \"Hey, you could be an assassin for all we know,\" says the man with the unwelcoming muscles. </p> <p>Eventually Davies arrives and I follow on his coat-tails. We walk through a tunnel of flashing cameras. \"They don't have a clue who I am,\" he says. He's probably right. In the green room, the actors and Davies gather before the screening. They are all working on different projects. When they ask him what he's moved on to, he holds his hands up. There is no new project. All his energy is still consumed in this film. Six years, and he never had time to think what may be next. \"I've no savvy. It's stupidity. Stupidity. I'm dim.\" </p> <p>I ask Eric Stoltz, who plays Gillian Anderson's unrequited lover, what Davies is like to work with. \"Terry is a whirlwind of passion. He's a Tasmanian devil crossed with Doris Day. He gets so passionately involved in everything he does that he becomes a dervish of activity and emotion.\" He looks over to Davies, who is giving someone a huge hug. \"He's quite subdued now, but on set... when he is up, there is no greater joy in the world than being around him.\" And when he's down? \"When he is in a dark place the world becomes darker. He's a truly lovely and unique artist. I do worry about him out in the world, though, because he feels things so deeply.\" </p> <p>Stoltz says, as an American actor, he was used to having things his own way; and suddenly Davies comes along and tells him how to say every line. \"He doesn't so much direct as conduct. He had the film in his head and we were there to serve his vision. However much it drove us mad, it also delighted us and intrigued us and fascinated us and we ended up loving him.\" </p> <p>In the centre of the room, Davies is engaged in a heated conversation with the actor Anthony LaPaglia. Others look keen to speak to him but keep their distance. </p> <p>Davies and the cast arrive in the box to see the last minutes of the film. At the end, a spotlight falls on them and they get a wonderful reception. Davies looks ecstatic. As the light goes down, he and producer Olivia Stewart are hugging in the dark. The hug turns into a slow dance. </p> <p>He's in terrific form in the post-film question and answer session. He tells the audience that he has cheered up no end since he's been seeing a shrink. \"My therapist and I have really bonded. Even he hates my father now.\" He says he still doesn't know anything about The X Files. \"It's about the paranormal, they say. Well the only paranormal I know is the internal revenue service.\" When asked what his next project will be, he says he fancies remaking some well-known films, \"but I'd do them as prequels, on very little money - Conan the Librarian, Strangers on a Bicycle, Monsieur Hulot Goes to Thomas Cook\". </p> <p>The guy who runs the festival doubles up. \"What a crack-up,\" he says. </p> <p>A woman with a first edition of The House of Mirth is among the autograph hunters outside. She looks at Davies intensely. \"I was a little worried about what you'd do with the book, but really you've done a very good job,\" she says. </p> <p> <strong> Day 4: the aftermath</strong> <br></p> <p> Davies seems in great nick. He's just had a bad review in the New York Times and he says he doesn't care. \"It just doesn't matter. We've done our best, and the audience reaction has, I think, proved that it is good. For the first time in my life I think I'm growing up and thinking it doesn't matter.\" About time too, I say. \"You're right, absolutely right. I can't tell you how right you are. I can look at it now with a kind of aesthetic difference and say, 'If people don't like it, I'm sorry about that,' but it doesn't destroy me like it used to. It used to destroy me.\" </p> <p>The new confidence lasts approximately a minute. He starts talking about yesterday's shopping debacle. When I look confused he says, \"Oh, didn't I tell you? I went to buy some perfume for my sister, and I know I've got some credit, $300-$400 credit on my card, but they wouldn't take it.\" He's telling the story with great brio, and I'm expecting a cracking punchline. But suddenly Davies's eyes are swirling with tears. \"I was desperately embarrassed, really humiliated, and I came back, rang Barclaycard, and the hotel had put the whole cost of my room, nearly \u00a31,000, on to my card, despite the fact that it said on the computer that Sony are paying for it.\" The tears are dribbling down his cheeks. \"I know it's silly to be upset by something like that. I was really low for some reason. Well, I know the reason. I get homesick after four days. I go back to the hotel and literally want to blow my brains out. This is just the anus mundi.\" What's that? \"The arse of the world\", and he smiles the softest of smiles. </p> <p>Davies is broke. He has never made money from his films. And even though The House of Mirth is his biggest budget movie, at $8m, his salary has been deferred and deferred again. He says he's not venal or greedy, but he's tired of living hand to mouth. I ask him what his ambition is, and he doesn't mention making it in America, or Oscars. \"I'd just like enough money to live on. I'm sick of struggling from one set of debts to another.\" </p> <p>What was that intense conversation about last night with Anthony LaPaglia? \"The trouble with me is I have no small talk,\" he says. \"Anthony was asking me why there was no music, and I was telling him that it didn't need any.\" Did LaPaglia like the film? \"I think he did, but it's hard to tell. I don't know. I didn't ask. If people like it they'll say, and if they don't say anything I assume they don't like it.\" </p> <p>Did Gillian Anderson like it? \"Well she didn't say, so I don't know.\" Did he want her to say she liked it? \"That would have given me a great deal of pleasure, yes it would have. The fact that she didn't ... it hurt me, yes. All she said was congratulations, but that's like saying the scenery's nice.\" </p> <p>I'm still trying to cheer him up, but failing miserably. You look so much better than when I saw you last, I say. Yes, he mutters, he hit rock bottom when his mother died. \"I wanted to die. I did. That's it, I thought. There's nothing else to live for, there just isn't because she was the love of my life. I loved her with all my heart, and I was able to tell her.\" He talks about the pleasure he got from being able to feed her, from making her last days comfortable. \"I just held her, and I just said, 'I love you so much,' and we didn't say anything else. I just held her hand.\" </p> <p>Did he really think he would kill himself? \"I don't think I have the courage, because I don't think it's an act of cowardice, I think it's courage - and I haven't got it.\" </p> <p>He talks about the handful of Edith Wharton boppers at last night's screening. \"Look at those young girls last night. Full of hope, those little faces, and you do pray that the hope doesn't get crushed. But what happens when hope is not realised, or crushed, or when hope is betrayed?\" This question seems to be at the heart of all Davies's films. Again he says he wishes he were good-looking and stupid, unaware. He probably says it every day, but never for effect. </p> <p>Then he asks who it was who said that truth can be bleak and painful, and only a lie is beautiful. \"Looking into your heart can be a very painful process. Being aware is a mug's game. An absolute mug's game.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The House of Mirth is released next Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Day 1: meeting the press It is three years since I last saw Terence Davies. His mother had just died, and he was in despair, and he'd tell anyone who stopped long enough to ask how he was. He couldn't see the point of going on. Actually, he looked as if he'd already given up. So it's hard to recognise the man lapping up the limelight on stage at New York's Lincoln Center. Physically he looks the same - the campest accountant you'll ever meet. It's his demeanour that has changed. An American journalist in the post-screening audience says: \"Meeting you here, you seem like the life of the party. Why don't you do an Ealing-style movie next time?\" Davies, who has made two of the most miserable and beautiful films in cinema history, licks his lips. \"I'd love to,\" he says, \"but having a good sense of humour isn't the same as being able to write comedy.\" This most English of Englishmen is revelling in the cerebral glitz of Manhattan. It's 12 years since Davies came to prominence with Distant Voices, Still Lives. The film was autobiographical, documenting the love with which his mother and nine siblings survived his father's brutality. As with all Davies's films, the images haunt you for ever, notably the father, played by Pete Postlethwaite, ripping away the tablecloth, and Christmas dinner with it - a silent, terrifying assault. Distant Voices, Still Lives was the second instalment of Davies's Liverpool life. The first, his rarely shown Trilogy, is made up of three short movies and is equally brilliant, equally unbearable. The Trilogy shows the young man trying, and failing, to come to terms with his homosexuality. Again, the images glue themselves to mind and soul - the solitary woman on the bus who breaks down and cries till there's nothing left; the father, played by Wilfrid \"Steptoe\" Brambell, coughing himself to death in a wordless scene that seems to last for ever. With these films Davies quietly reinvented cinema. The camera barely moved, the actors barely acted - they were more like living photographs than movies. After a six-year absence Davies is back with his fifth film, an adaptation of Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth, and the New York journalists are stunned by what they have just seen. Yes, this period piece is a conventional film - a radical departure for Davies - but it is a savage take on New York society in the early 20th century. It's a perfect film for a New York audience - after all, it is set in the city, though it was actually shot in Glasgow because it was so much cheaper. But it's still astonishing to find Davies here, feted wherever he goes. It was surprising enough when the abused child grew into a man who managed to hold down a job for so many years; even more surprising when he gave it all up to make his art-house movies. Now here he is, unable to move for Oscar talk, explaining how he turned Gillian Anderson, one of today's biggest television stars, into a formidable film actor. He may resist the idea, but, as he tells the world's press why he adapted Wharton's novel and they hang on his every word, he's on the cusp of the big time. \"What is extraordinary about the book is its modernity,\" he says. \"It's about the destruction of one person by a social class, it's about how much money you've got, what you look like - and what is modern society about if not how much money you've got and what you look like?\" When Lily Bart, the heroine played by Anderson, refuses to marry for money and fails to salvage her reputation by ruining that of the man she loves, she is destroyed. He is asked why he chose Anderson. Davies looks a little sheepish as he embarks on a typical story. \"When I cast her I hadn't seen The X Files and still haven't because I don't watch television except for the news and some documentaries. I was looking for faces that looked like the Singer Sargent portraits of the belle \u00e9poque , and I said, 'That is a John Singer Sargent face, who is she?'\" Davies invited her over for a pot of tea, as he does, and it turned out that the American celebrity knew all about the obscure British film-maker. \"Apparently, she was a fan. She told me she had seen The Long Day Closes and had cried at the tracking shot over the carpet.\" In The Long Day Closes, Davies's father finally dies, he discovers movies, the family discovers peace, and for four years he embraces life ecstatically. Davies's tracking shot is perhaps his most distinctive trait: the camera languorously glides over a carpet, a cinema audience, the Atlantic ocean. The technique is self-indulgent, audacious and gorgeous. The great worry about Terence Davies - one of the great worries about him - was that once he had exhausted his family life, there would be nothing left. He says he knew he had to escape his own history. Technically, he did this with his last film, The Neon Bible, but even here the boy with his tender misery was little more than an American version of young Terry. \"When you mine your own seam, you also destroy it,\" he says. \"There's a point where you become repetitive - there's nothing else to say. My great love is Eliot's Four Quartets and these were my modest version of the Four Quartets, based on the suffering of myself and my own family.\" Day 2: on the road We're in a yellow cab on the way to a radio interview. Davies and his PR, Mark, are trying to outcamp each other. Mark stares at a huge billboard advert for Tommy Hilfiger - a male model in nothing but his six-pack and underpants. \"It's very popular, that advert in New York,\" Mark says. \"I bet it is! I can imagine,\" Davies answers. Mark tells him The House of Mirth has just been reviewed in Newsweek - three and a half stars. \"Is that good?\" Davies asks. \"Three and a half out of four. We're doing OK.\" Davies disappears into a tiny booth. He's talking about modernity again, the way that the greatest dramas always remain contemporary. \"Because they touch on basic human terrors. We could be Medea saying to Jason, 'If you leave me, I'll kill the children.' Horrific though it is, we can understand that possessive love. Believe me, I understand possessive love.\" Davies left school when he was 15, qualified for little but victimhood. After the four years of bliss following his father's death, he went on to secondary school where he was bullied constantly. His voice is smoky, seductive, with little trace of Liverpool. For some reason, he says, at school he started to talk like the Queen Mother. When he left, he worked as an unqualified accountant for 12 years. He hates the fact that he had the pedantic, quibbling mind to be a good accountant. He also trained and worked as an actor for many of those years. He knew, though, that he didn't have the physical appeal to become a huge success. Davies complains that he looks like an avocado. \"I'd give anything to be really good-looking and have a wonderful body and be really stupid,\" he says. \"It's an unbeatable combo.\" The radio presenter makes the inevitable comparison with Martin Scorsese, who also adapted a Wharton book, The Age of Innocence. Davies protests. \"Martin Scorsese is a huge name! I'm not a huge name. I go into a room full of people and I'm the only person I've not heard of. I think his film is a masterpiece. There are shots I would die for.\" He describes one, and looks as if he's about to explode with enthusiasm. \"God, it's ravishing. I don't feel in the same class as Martin Scorsese. Although I must say I met him when he came to London. He invited me to dinner, which was so charming. So charming . And he's got a very good sense of humour. I said, 'What's your next film?' He said it was about the Dalai Lama, and I said, 'What are you going to call it, Hello Dalai?' And he said, 'No, Raging Lama!' \" Davies dissolves into hysterics, as does the presenter. \"First you make me cry, now you're making me laugh,\" she says. \"You're making me forget everything.\" \"It's a gift,\" Davies says. He's turned into No\u00ebl Coward. The pair of them are flirting like crazy inside their tiny booth. We're walking along Sixth Avenue towards his hotel. Davies is talking about how American musicals and the Ealing comedies influenced him. I ask him whether he's joking about the comedies. No, he says. Of course not. Earlier in the day he had said how churlish the English could be, and cited the saying \"too clever by half\" as an example. I wonder what his family makes of the man who finds it hard to open his mouth without quoting Shakespeare or Keats or TS Eliot. Do they call him too clever by half? \"No. They're terribly proud of me, as I'm proud of them. But they think this life is glamour, and it's not. Why should I spoil it for them, though?\" When his mother was alive they'd speak to each other every day at 6pm. \"If I was somewhere like here, I'd phone up and say, 'Guess where I am, Mum? New York.' And she'd say, 'You're not !'\" He smiles. When he made Distant Voices, Still Lives it was tough on the family. Some of his brothers and sisters felt he was wrong to expose his father, that it was private business. \"But my mum just said, 'He's told the truth.' Which was pretty fantastic. She was a pretty fantastic woman. She had no bitterness in her.\" Davies was only six and a half when his father, a rag and bone man, died, but he says those few years damaged him for life. \"I'm still acutely aware of atmosphere in a room. When I was a kid I'd run into a room and if he didn't want anyone around, he'd just kick me from one end of the house to the other. You don't make that mistake very often.\" Did he ever think his father would kill him? \"No. What was terrifying was the silences, and the cruelty that was in the air. Then it would all start again. I thought he'd kill my mum because on one occasion he just picked up an axe. My eldest sister hit him over the head with a milk bottle. I didn't want her to die. I thought, 'What would I do if she died?'\" Every day he feels the influence of his father - in his relationship with other people. \"The damage that is done when you're a child is so long-lasting. Especially having your self-esteem taken away. You can never regain it. I feel inferior to most men, especially if they've got good bodies and are good-looking. I really feel inferior, and I have to say I'm full of jealousy.\" He says he regards his homosexuality as a curse. \"I loathe it. It's ruined my life, and I wish I were normal and ordinary. I'm no good at sex anyway.\" He is celibate and says he has long forsaken the dream of a boyfriend and stable domestic gay life. His guilt was compounded by his Catholicism. \"On one occasion I prayed until my knees bled.\" At 22 he rejected Catholicism as a lie. But if Terence Davies seems miserable now, that is just one side of him. He feels joy as intensely as despair. When he talks about Shostakovich, Brahms, poetry, or the \"women's films\" he loves, or the paintings of Vermeer and the magical way that light falls on a window, he is transported. Laura Linney, who also stars in The House Of Mirth, says: \"He is the most passionate person I have ever met. He has enormous passion for his work, his life, his likes, his dislikes.\" I tell him how great it's been to see him so upbeat in public. Yes, he says, it's been a successful trip, it's been lovely seeing old friends and, yes, he does get enormous pleasure from so many things. He qualifies himself. He says he knows, just knows, some small thing will happen in the next few days to ruin it all. \"I tell you. I'll see something that in anybody else would just not matter and it will make me feel so depressed, someone crossing the street or an old person not being helped or something, and that's it - the veil falls from life and you see what lies behind it, and it's absolute terror.\" Sometimes his own words seem to bring on another bout of nausea. He says he's aware of what he's trying to achieve when he tells people about his life, about the wounds. \"I'm saying, 'Love me, love me; like me, like me.' And at 55, there's something really rather tawdry about that. It's adolescent, for God's sake.\" Day 3: the premiere The fans are milling outside the Lincoln Center.

The boy's fianc\u00e9e, Anna, returns; they prepare to flee. But Leo seduces her too; Leo's old girlfriend Vera also appears on the scene and the film's climax arrives with the four of them doing a kind of vaudeville dance number to Tanz Ein Samba Mit Mir as the preamble to a group sex session in which Franz, shocked and yearning for the bourgeois conneries of hearth and home, cannot participate. </p> <p>There's a residual trace of supercilious theatre radicalism in this piece, made more uncomfortable by its evident datedness. But for all the occasional creakiness, Ozon's film works as an elegant, mischievous chamber piece about the mystery of erotic submission and the mortality of desire. </p> <p>Although set in one interior location, this movie never looks too stagy. Ozon prowls with feline surefootedness around the apartment. We move easily from the tiled bathroom, where Leo tries to enjoy a relaxing bath while Franz has the stereo on too loud, to the swinging and liberated bedroom with its creepy wall-size mirror. It is clear that this is to be the arena not merely for uninhibited desire, but much houseproud fussiness. On the point of getting Franz into bed, Leo chivvies him into the bedroom and says: \"I'll wash the glasses and be right in.\" Wash the glasses ? When he's just about to get it on? We thought he was supposed to be mad about the boy. Can't the dirty glasses wait? </p> <p>Apparently not. And the writing is on the wall for this relationship, shown degenerating into a desperate parody of loveless marriage, with Franz cast as the put-upon servant, more housewife than houseboy, who can do nothing right. Bernard Giraudeau gives a strong performance as the vain, masterful Leo, priding himself on looking young for 50, and perpetually smoothing his suspiciously jet-black hair. </p> <p>As Vera, his embittered older lover, Anna Thomson walks around in a state of shock, devastated by the realisation that she will brood about the faithless Leo every day for the rest of her life, while he will hardly give her a second thought. (It is a very different role from the one Thomson had in Cannes this year, in Amos Kollek's Allenesque light comedy, Fast Food, Fast Women.) </p> <p>Some critics have seen in the transposition from German to French a pleasing transfer of emphasis from the astringency and strident ironies associated with Fassbinder to the cool, cruel poise of a French comedy of sexual jealousy and sexual identity. That said, there is still a distinctively German tone to the movie, from the way Franz languorously murmurs Heinrich Heine's Lorelei to the fact that he wears lederhosen around the house. </p> <p>It may be that in modish intellectual circles in Europe, the novels of Michel Houellebecq have renewed sexual desire and promiscuity as subjects of high seriousness: subjects from which disquisitions on the future of society and culture can be developed. Water Drops on Burning Rocks may find its voice in this discursive current: it is a film in which the search for conquest and sexual pleasure is utterly dominant, and yet perpetually found to be emotionally and intellectually negligible. </p> <p>Ozon's movie shows a nexus of relationships tested to destruction on Leo's double bed and yet nothing seems to be left afterwards but the wreckage. The older man is revered as someone who \"teaches\" both Franz and Anna in the ways of physical love - and yet the scholars of this ambiguous college of Eros can only graduate in disaffection. </p> <p>When quizzed about his family by Leo at the beginning of the movie, Franz claims that he loves his mother best of all, and yet this relationship signally fails to deliver any redemptive meaning: by the time Ozon lowers the curtain, she appears casually indifferent to Franz's unhappy, melodramatic fate. Moments of compassion fizzle and expire like the water drops of the title. </p> <p>It is a slight film in some ways, and maybe a little claustrophobic and lacking in nourishment, but the polish and style of Ozon's direction shapes it, and gives it wit and panache.</p>",
