Tomorrow's semi-final allows him to continue a pastime that must have brought him great pleasure at Southampton - dreaming of Europe. </p> <p>\"I'm thankful we've actually got some silverware to aim for,\" Hoddle says. \"I could have been joining just to see out the end of the season, to get to know the players and who I need to bring in, but there's an added incentive of an FA Cup and a European place. </p> <p>\"Europe is important to this club. There's been some wonderful European nights over the years and we can bring them back by winning the FA Cup. And if you're in Europe it gives you the opportunity to entice the players that you might want to bring in. So it's not just an FA Cup semi-final, and it's not just a match against Arsenal. It's much bigger than that.\" </p> <p>It is hard to think of many more important fixtures in the club's recent past and it is equally hard to imagine more trying circumstances in which to have approached it. Not only do Spurs have new owners and a new manager but their preparations have been hampered by an extensive injury list. A shadow side lost 2-0 to Arsenal last week and several players will return tomorrow before, in truth, they should. </p> <p>\"It's a strange scenario,\" says Hoddle. \"Especially with it being against Arsenal and against Arsene.\" Wenger, of course, is the manager who opened Hoddle's eyes to coaching while both were at Monaco. </p> <p>\"Arsene saw something in me that I didn't see in myself at the time. I've always got respect for Arsene and I'm always going to be a friend of his because, well, sometimes in life you just gel with someone. Our trouble is that we've never had time to get together socially. That might be a bit difficult now.\" </p> <p>Despite the hype and hyperbole surrounding the game, Hoddle is looking confident and composed as the pressure rises. \"I feel very relaxed,\" he says. \"I feel as though I've sort of come home. You wouldn't expect to go to a new job in any environ ment, wherever you're working, and feel comfortable straight away. It always takes you a while to slip into gear. I just feel like I've been here all my life.\" </p> <p>It helps that several staff, from the coach Chris Hughton down to the kit man, remain from when he was last there. But it adds to the sense of circumstance that has surrounded Hoddle's return. \"I had a chance to come here before, when I went to Chelsea, and I turned it down.\" he says. \"At the time I felt the circumstances weren't correct - I can't explain why, it's too private - but I thought maybe the opportunity had passed me by. </p> <p>\"It's ironic how Arsene's a strange name but the way it's spelt is very close to Arsenal. And you think why, of all the clubs in Europe, in the world, why does he end up at that one? Perhaps he was destined to coach there.\" </p> <p>There will be more talk of destiny should Spurs win tomorrow, given that the year ends in Tottenham's lucky one. But for Hoddle the game is just the start of a greater mission. </p> <p>\"I'm the first to put pressure on myself,\" he says. \"That's where the main pressure for me will come but within five years my ideals are that we will be qualifying for the Champions League; that's got to be realistic. It'll be hard but at the end of the day you've got to believe in your principles. So I won't hide away from a challenge. And this is a massive challenge.\" </p> <p>And Hoddle's first real test has already arrived. \"Arsenal are one of the best sides in the country,\" he says, \"but in FA Cup semi-finals, and in London derbies, a lot of that can go out the window frankly. I think we can win the game.\" It could be their destiny.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>When the ownership of a rugby club seems a more plausible financial investment than Queens Park Rangers, football is in trouble. </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>How do you make a small fortune out of football? It's easy: start with a large one and buy your own club. The latest wealthy man to discover the truth in the old gag is Chris Wright. In the space of little more than five years Wright has seen the fortune he began to accrue back in the 70s selling prog-rock albums to hairy sixth-formers rapidly ebb away down the open drain otherwise known as Queens Park Rangers. </p> <p>This week Loftus Road PLC went into administration; there was simply not enough cash around to run the business. In truth it had been like that for some time but Wright's cheque book had been subsidising affairs. The moment he felt he could no longer support his hobby (a moment, incidentally, which coincided with sections of the crowd turning against him) was when stark reality hit. </p> <p>And stark it is. The Rangers case is the most dramatic example yet that the football business is in profound trouble. It all began back in 1996, when Wright, a long-standing fan and season ticket holder, paid \u00a310m for a controlling stake in a club which had just been relegated from the Premiership. At the time he appeared to be going into ownership with his eyes wide open. \"I'm a \u00a340m man,\" he told a group of fans. \"And what this club needs is a \u00a3;400m man.\" </p> <p>Even so, he behaved as if he were a \u00a3400m man, his love of the club clouding his business sense. In his anxiety to return to the top division, Wright allowed money to be lavished on inadequate players. </p> <p>\"Mistakes were made early on,\" one Loftus Road insider told me this week. \"There was this overwhelming desire to get back at all costs and it changed the way the club had always been run.\" </p> <p>QPR had traditionally been a selling club. That was how they survived, nurturing talent, cashing it in, then using the profit to maintain operations. Wright - displaying the ambition every fan wants to see in their chairman - affected the balance. It is best illustrated by the case of Trevor Sinclair. Widely reckoned a \u00a310m asset when he scored the goal of the season in 1996, instead of being cashed in at the peak of his value, Sinclair was tied to the club by golden handcuffs. </p> <p>But his subtle skills were not appropriate to a First Division scramble and, when he was finally let go to West Ham, it was in a deal largely made up by second-rate players coming in the opposite direction. No more than \u00a31m was banked for him. Meanwhile young players who might have been developed and sold found their progress blocked by old lags signed in the forlorn hope they might achieve promotion. The last QPR player to raise a decent fee was Nigel Quashie, sold to Nottingham Forest for \u00a32.5m more than two seasons ago. </p> <p>But it was the wages that finally undermined Wright's vision. It is not the remuneration of box- office performers such as Roy Keane and Alen Boksic that is football's achilles heel. It is the fact that at a club like QPR at least half a dozen players were paid \u00a35,000 a week each. In no other walk of life would employees who are not very good at their job be earning a quarter of a million pounds a year. </p> <p>Yet that was the business plan Wright felt obliged to follow. And, as the depressing cycle of poor performance and falling crowds kicked in, as the gap between income and expenditure stretched to over \u00a3;50,000 a week, it was the business plan that brought the club to the lip of bankruptcy. </p> <p>\"The sad thing is,\" my Loftus Road mole suggested, \"I don't think those who come into the game because they love it can survive any more. They certainly don't have any fun. Money rules. Nothing else matters. And only those clubs backed by serious money will succeed.\" </p> <p>A glance at the First Division table, with Fulham and Blackburn perched at the top, would suggest he has a point. As for Chris Wright, from the tatters of the multi-sport empire he hoped to create in west London, he has emerged clutching Wasps rugby club, retained in a deal with the administrators yesterday. And when the ownership of a rugby club seems a more plausible financial investment, football is in trouble. If Wright needs a shoulder to cry on, he could do worse than set up an ex-chairman's support group with the eternally bitter Alan Sugar, comparing the burns on their fingers and waiting for the next man looking to make a small fortune out of football to join them. </p> <p><strong>Dennis' investment is not so wise</strong></p> <p>Never use the Chelsea match programme as a source of financial advice. On January 26 1997 Ken Bates dedicated his column in the publication to promoting his latest venture. </p> <p>\"People are queuing up to buy Chelsea Village shares since we floated on the AIM,\" he wrote. \"Our shares in circulation have increased by over 50% and the share price has doubled.\" </p> <p>Dennis Wise, he revealed, had bought \u00a375,000 worth, the first player to become a shareholder in his own club. </p> <p>\"Thanks Dennis for the vote of confidence,\" Bates added. \"You keep banging in the goals and I'll keep trying to bang up the share price.\" </p> <p>On December 30 1997 Wise also used the programme to endorse his stock. \"I'm doing this column on Wednesday afternoon and it's approaching 4 o'clock, I need to go and get the latest prices in the Evening Standard so I can check my Chelse a Village shares. They're flying at the moment. The boys call me Batesey's son and they reckon he says I'm the second most important person in the club after him because I've got the second most number of shares.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, as Chelsea Village shares hit 33.5p, Wise's investment was worth about \u00a325,000. Presumably the next Chelsea programme will include a column by the city analyst who this week described football shares as the dot.coms of the mid-90s;today's fashion is tomorrow's tank tops. </p>",

But what about the present team: is there a crack or two in the plaster or are these merely a few cobwebs to be easily brushed away? </p> <p>The question is put not so much because Sir Alex Ferguson's team lost the home leg of their European Cup quarter-final 1-0 to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, a result United are quite capable of overturning in the Olympic stadium, but because of some of the comments which have followed that performance. </p> <p>When the media predict the beginning of the end of the Manchester United era it is often a case of the wish being father to the thought. Most professional critics do not share the Manuphobia of rival supporters but they would like to have something fresh about which to comment. </p> <p>Dissenting voices from within Ferguson's squad, however, are an entirely different kettle of Red snappers. No sooner had Paulo Sergio come off the Bayern bench to score the goal which threatens to remove Manchester United from the European Cup at the quarter-final stage for the third time in four seasons than doubts about the team's future were being raised in unexpected places. </p> <p>Ryan Giggs, for example, was quoted as saying that the present side were not the team they had been in winning the tournament two years ago. United, he declared, had lost their spark. </p> <p>Then Teddy Sheringham was reported to have misgivings about what would happen once Ferguson had retired at the end of next season. Fergie's successor, he felt, would have an extremely difficult task, not least in controlling the big names in the side. </p> <p>This hardly paints a rosy picture of the world's richest club advancing to ever greater glories, while the best the rest of English football can hope for is the odd cup with entry to the Champions League by a side door. </p> <p>Even the latest evidence of Old Trafford's seemingly limitless capacity for making money was accompanied by some financial caveats. While Manchester United's interim results reveal large increases in turnover and respectable pre-tax profits, with cash from the latest television deal still to come and the \u00a3303m Nike contract due to start next year, the club are concerned about players' wages getting out of hand. </p> <p>Because of this United are to implement a tiered salary structure, whereby the money individual players receive will depend on the amount of club revenue they are estimated to have generated, as well as what they are thought to be worth in the transfer market - always assuming that one still exists. </p> <p>It sounds like a recipe for dressing-room rebellion although the players are said to be happy with the new arrangement. Either way, and with a number of contracts still to be renegotiated, it is clear that the millions of pounds which normally dominate football headlines in the close season will be spent equally trying to keep the players they already have as signing new talents like PSV Eindhoven's striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. </p> <p>Given the sums that David Beckham - who is likely to be on \u00a3100,000 a week next season - Giggs and other regulars in Ferguson's team will be earning there seems little doubt that the present side will stay together for some time yet -unless, that is, Ferguson agrees with Giggs that the team could do with a fresh set of spark-plugs. </p> <p>Sheringham is undoubtedly correct when he forecasts the difficulties the next man in charge of Manchester United will face. Like all successful managers Ferguson has the priceless knack of knowing when his side, however successful it has been, is due for changes of personnel, shape, tactics or organisation. Sir Matt Busby had it at Old Trafford before him, Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley had it at Liverpool and Arsene Wenger has it at Arsenal. </p> <p>What Manchester United will be extremely fortunate to rediscover, however, is another burgeoning youth side ready to mature and thrive together over a period of 10 years. Footballers of the quality of Giggs, Beckham and Paul Scholes do not come along that often as individuals, let alone in a bunch. </p> <p>United would not have won the Premier ship in 1993 without the singular spiky Gallic influence of Eric Cantona or Peter Schmeichel's goalkeeping, and so much of their subsequent success is owed to Roy Keane. </p> <p>Expensive signings like Dwight Yorke, Jaap Stam and, this season, Fabien Barthez have done much to maintain and heighten the standards of excellence within the side and Andy Cole's prolific scoring record speaks for itself. </p> <p>Yet the best of Manchester United has always had youth at its core, from Busby's doomed babes to Ferguson's fulfilled fledglings, and once the Premiership hat-trick has been achieved - probably at home to Manchester City a fortnight today - as much interest should be taken in Darren Fletcher and others queuing up behind Wes Brown and Luke Chadwick as anyone waiting at airport immigration just off the M56.</p>",

This hardly paints a rosy picture of the world's richest club advancing to ever greater glories, while the best the rest of English football can hope for is the odd cup with entry to the Champions League by a side door. Even the latest evidence of Old Trafford's seemingly limitless capacity for making money was accompanied by some financial caveats. While Manchester United's interim results reveal large increases in turnover and respectable pre-tax profits, with cash from the latest television deal still to come and the \u00a3303m Nike contract due to start next year, the club are concerned about players' wages getting out of hand. Because of this United are to implement a tiered salary structure, whereby the money individual players receive will depend on the amount of club revenue they are estimated to have generated, as well as what they are thought to be worth in the transfer market - always assuming that one still exists. It sounds like a recipe for dressing-room rebellion although the players are said to be happy with the new arrangement. Either way, and with a number of contracts still to be renegotiated, it is clear that the millions of pounds which normally dominate football headlines in the close season will be spent equally trying to keep the players they already have as signing new talents like PSV Eindhoven's striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. Given the sums that David Beckham - who is likely to be on \u00a3100,000 a week next season - Giggs and other regulars in Ferguson's team will be earning there seems little doubt that the present side will stay together for some time yet -unless, that is, Ferguson agrees with Giggs that the team could do with a fresh set of spark-plugs. Sheringham is undoubtedly correct when he forecasts the difficulties the next man in charge of Manchester United will face. Like all successful managers Ferguson has the priceless knack of knowing when his side, however successful it has been, is due for changes of personnel, shape, tactics or organisation. Sir Matt Busby had it at Old Trafford before him, Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley had it at Liverpool and Arsene Wenger has it at Arsenal. What Manchester United will be extremely fortunate to rediscover, however, is another burgeoning youth side ready to mature and thrive together over a period of 10 years. Footballers of the quality of Giggs, Beckham and Paul Scholes do not come along that often as individuals, let alone in a bunch. United would not have won the Premier ship in 1993 without the singular spiky Gallic influence of Eric Cantona or Peter Schmeichel's goalkeeping, and so much of their subsequent success is owed to Roy Keane. Expensive signings like Dwight Yorke, Jaap Stam and, this season, Fabien Barthez have done much to maintain and heighten the standards of excellence within the side and Andy Cole's prolific scoring record speaks for itself. Yet the best of Manchester United has always had youth at its core, from Busby's doomed babes to Ferguson's fulfilled fledglings, and once the Premiership hat-trick has been achieved - probably at home to Manchester City a fortnight today - as much interest should be taken in Darren Fletcher and others queuing up behind Wes Brown and Luke Chadwick as anyone waiting at airport immigration just off the M56.",

Wiltord's reputation as a man for the big occasion is well established. Scorer of France's equaliser in the Euro 2000 final, he struck twice on the last day of the 1998-99 season to bring Bordeaux the French title. The sense of anticipation at facing Tottenham is apparent. \"It's going to be a real battle,\" he says with a smile. </p> <p>The 26-year-old could hardly look more relaxed in the dining room at Arsenal's training ground, a mood not always associated with him since his protracted \u00a313m move from Bordeaux last August. Shortly after his arrival one headline bemoaned \"Another case of French whine\". </p> <p>Frustrated by his lack of first-team opportunities, late for training and reportedly \"pining for France\", Wiltord left some wondering whether Arsenal had landed a second Nicolas Anelka at around 20 times the price. Even acceptance from within was not automatic. \"I could read in the eyes of our English players,\" Wiltord said, \"that they thought I was not mentally tough.\" </p> <p>The striker is beginning to justify his value now. The comparisons are less with Anelka's antics and more with the explosive talent of Ian Wright. The two goals that removed Chelsea from the Cup were followed by a hat-trick against West Ham in the league. On Wednesday Wiltord's introduction helped turn the Champions League match against Valencia. Tomorrow he is expected to start. The message is emphatic: Je ne regrette rien. </p> <p>\"I think I needed about two and a half months before I was really in the English groove,\" he reflects. \"People thought that I wanted to go back to France and that I wasn't totally committed but I think that was only part of the process of settling in. You have to be very patient. You have to watch, learn and listen to the coach. </p> <p>\"The adaptation period when you come to England can be difficult because we have certain habits in France which don't necessarily fit in with the English culture. But I feel I have settled in very well now. I'm playing more, scoring more and I'm very, very happy. There are other French players here who have made it easier.\" </p> <p>Robert Pires, with whom he lived in the same hotel for a while, is a close friend. The knowledge that Thierry Henry also needed time to settle, hopping on and off the bench and scoring only once in his first 12 league games, has given Wiltord further heart. The proximity of several compatriots at other clubs has helped him adapt quickly to London. </p> <p>\"We see the Chelsea players, Marcel Desailly, Frank Leboeuf and Bernarde Lambourde,\" he says. \"We chat, go to restaurants. We talk about France, about going out and we try to forget about football.\" </p> <p>Initially Wiltord had plenty he was keen to forget about. As an automatic choice at Bordeaux he did not find it easy coping with Arsene Wenger's rotation policy or fighting for selection with Henry, Nwankwo Kanu and Dennis Bergkamp, who is now injured. </p> <p>\"When you regularly play a lot of matches you develop a rhythm and when I arrived here I wasn't playing much,\" he says. \"It was hard because I had to get my head straight. I had to keep motivated and that wasn't easy. I prefer it if the best players are playing on the field the whole time.\" </p> <p>A hint that Arsenal's record signing feels he should start more often? \"If things are going well for me during the match, then yes. If I perform well, play well with my strike partner and score goals, that's the reward for the work you do. But unfortunately, despite playing well, I find myself back on the bench.\" </p> <p>Kanu is likely to be given the substitute's role tomorrow as Wenger deploys Henry and Wiltord. Of eight games they have started together, Arsenal have won only one, at home to Tottenham last weekend, and Wiltord knows this Spurs side will be tougher than the one beaten 2-0 at Highbury. </p> <p>Wiltord's relationship with Wenger has had its icy moments. \"From time to time we clash but that's normal between a manager and a player,\" he says. \"Sometimes it's fine and other times it's more tense. When you are a player you are going to have to ask the manager what's going on.\" </p> <p>In any case Wiltord is hardly the shy, retiring type. At the training ground he has been known to walk into a room, scream and burst out laughing. His infectious personality has, some believe, helped to replace the void left by Wright. \"I'm just full of life, explosive and I like to show it,\" Wiltord says. </p> <p>The rebellious streak he displayed in France appears to have subsided but a toughness remains, the legacy of his childhood in Neuilly-sur-Marne, near Paris, where he and his seven brothers and sisters were raised by their mother, a nurse. </p> <p>\"My mum brought me up when it wasn't easy,\" says Wiltord, who returned to Paris on Thursday to launch a children's football tournament. \"She was pretty strict and I'm even stronger because of that. It's allowed me to have a hard personality and taught me how to look after myself.\" </p> <p>Nine goals in 24 games for France prove Wiltord can look after himself at international level. His equaliser against Italy last summer elevated not just his standing in his homeland but his transfer fee. </p> <p>Now he recognises the need to defeat Tottenham: \"The championship is the most important thing to win but that will be Manchester United's. It's important for everyone, the fans, the players and the manager, that we win the Cup.\" </p> <p>With six Cup goals so far, no one can accuse Wiltord of not doing his bit.</p>",

O'Neill, who worked with the midfielder at Leicester, rates him alongside Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. \"His contribution has been immense with Paul Lambert being out [through injury],\" he said. \"Whether we would have been in this position without Lennon is highly debatable. \"His ability on the ball, his ability to keep the momentum going with a five-yard pass, his ability to take the sting out of the game . . . I have seldom seen him beaten for pace or for trickery. Lennon aspires to get into that world-class group and he is not far removed from it. \"He doesn't score goals. If he could score 10 goals a season, he would be the best player in the world.\" The respect was mutual. \"He's relentless, he drives players on. He doesn't dazzle you with science, everything is simple, black and white,\" Lennon said of O'Neill. Next season's Scottish Cup final is to be moved from its traditional end-of-season date to a week before the last league fixtures so that the turf at Hampden Park can be protected for the European Cup final. The 2002 Scottish Cup final will be on May 4, with the last league games on May 11.",

      "bodyText": "Seven teams from the old Third Division or new Second Division have reached the FA Cup semi-finals. None made it to the final 1937 Leeds Road, Huddersfield Millwall 1 Sunderland 2 Millwall, who in 1900 had reached the last four as a Southern League side, knocked out three First Division teams - Chelsea, Derby and Man City - assisted by nine goals from Dave Mangnall. Here he scored a tenth, but they lost. 1954 Villa Park Port Vale 1 WBA 2 Defence was the main virtue of Freddie Steele's team. They kept a clean sheet from the third round but Albion came from behind to win. 1955 Hillsborough York City 1 Newcastle Utd 1 Replay, Roker Park York City 0 Newcastle Utd 2 York looked set for Wembley when Arthur Bottom put them ahead, but Vic Keeble's goal saved Newcastle. Although beaten in replay,York had gone further than any Third Division side. 1959 White Hart Lane Norwich City 1 Luton Town 1 Replay, St Andrews Norwich City 0 Luton Town 1 Archie Macaulay's team were strongly fancied to win the Cup in 1959. The big names had gone out, Manchester United and Tottenham at Carrow Road. Yet in the semi-finals a Billy Bingham goal won the replay. 1976 Stamford Bridge C Palace 0 Southampton 2 Fedorahs in Palace colours showed affinity with Malcolm Allison's headgear. With Peter Taylor on the left Palace were fancied for the final but Lawrie McMenemy's side, then in the Second, had other ideas. 1984 Villa Park Plymouth Argyle 0 Watford 1 John Hore managed Plymouth for one full season but packed a lot into it. While Argyle had knocked out only one First Division side, WBA, a Wembley place looked possible. But George Reilly's goal settled matters and Hore was sacked the following October. 1997 Old Trafford Chesterfield 3 Middlesbrough 3 Replay, Hillsborough Chesterfield 0 Middlesbrough 3 Chesterfield would surely have made history had David Elleray or his assistant seen a Jonathan Howard shot cross the line. That would have given the Spireites a 3-1 lead against 10 men. Instead, Boro survived and won the replay.",

Her Hall\u00e9 debut, partnering Osmo Vanska in Beethoven's Violin Concerto, gave Manchester audiences a chance to hear a repeat of her acclaimed performance at last year's Proms. At 21, her supreme technical mastery of Beethoven's Concerto is enviable; but that is not what makes her special. Technique is overlaid with a musical authority that is both distinctive and commanding. </p> <p>The Beethoven Concerto is one of the most lyrical in the repertoire, with long stretches of haunting stillness that require careful handling if they are not to drag. But Batiashvili was in no hurry: each phrase was lingered over with loving care, as though she had all the time in the world. Arguably, the larghetto is not well served by this approach: some momentum is inevitably lost. </p> <p>Perversely, to apply rubato so consistently also robs this movement of its timeless, static quality. In Batiashvili's hands, it became a kind of recitative-fantasia, both spellbinding and touching. </p> <p>To respond to every nuance as the Hall\u00e9 did takes extraordinary flexibility. There was no lingering in the usually light-hearted finale, though. Its whimsical humour was replaced by something far more elemental; at the end of a breathtakingly virtuosic performance, the audience erupted. </p> <p>Two of Jean Sibelius's Lemminkainen Legends remained unpublished until 1954; in the meantime, the second of the cycle, The Swan of Tuonela, and the final movement, Lemminkainen's Return, became established repertoire. It is easy to see why the third, Lemminkainen in Tuonela, was not able to flourish independently: it is dark and so tightly woven that it appears almost monothematic. But the exotic first movement, depicting the maidens of Saari, is self-contained and colourful. </p> <p>Together, the four legends constitute an epic narrative of love, enchantment, death and rebirth almost symphonic in scale. The Hall\u00e9's performance of the third and final movements bristled with nervous energy under Vanska's fast tempi; the eerie melancholy of the second movement was mesmerisingly captured in Tom Davey's haunting cor anglais solo.</p>",

Its whimsical humour was replaced by something far more elemental; at the end of a breathtakingly virtuosic performance, the audience erupted. Two of Jean Sibelius's Lemminkainen Legends remained unpublished until 1954; in the meantime, the second of the cycle, The Swan of Tuonela, and the final movement, Lemminkainen's Return, became established repertoire. It is easy to see why the third, Lemminkainen in Tuonela, was not able to flourish independently: it is dark and so tightly woven that it appears almost monothematic. But the exotic first movement, depicting the maidens of Saari, is self-contained and colourful. Together, the four legends constitute an epic narrative of love, enchantment, death and rebirth almost symphonic in scale. The Hall\u00e9's performance of the third and final movements bristled with nervous energy under Vanska's fast tempi; the eerie melancholy of the second movement was mesmerisingly captured in Tom Davey's haunting cor anglais solo.",

Its subject is the nature of grief and memory, and it depends partly for its effect upon a game of free association played between musicians and audience. </p> <p>The concertos, written between 1990 and 1992, can be performed individually, in sequence or in any combination. The structure is consequently fluid, and the work's impact depends not on a sense of totality but on a lexicographical cross-referencing between sections. You are drawn into a maze of sound, through which you have to make your own way, though you are given clues. </p> <p>Lyricism is juxtaposed with violence, implicit or explicit, in each concerto. Timbres and sonorities are full of echoing allusions throughout. The soloists are allotted carefully differentiated characters. The pianist is an abiding presence, though his lines are often subsumed by the remainder of the instrumentalists, from whom he occasionally struggles free with brief, playful solos: the effect is of a persistent memory that wafts in and out of focus. The trumpeter, however, seemingly absents himself from the work for long stretches at a time, only to return to it as an exuberant, galvanic presence, carving the air with ebullient baroque solos. </p> <p>Occasionally you are left in the dark as to who, or what, is being remembered and mourned. References to both Austro-German and modernist musical traditions thread their way through the work. The term \"spiritual concerto\" derives from Sch\u00fctz and reflects Henze's fascination with the baroque. Vicious marches recall Mahler. Sudden convulsive rhythmic pile-ups bring echoes of Stravinsky in their wake, while one sonic cluster - saxophone solo over strings - hints at Berg's Lulu. </p> <p>It is a darkly impressive, if flawed work that never fails to grab your intellect, but doesn't always fully engage your emotions. A whiff of objective cool certainly permeated Christoph von Dohnanyi's performance, though the Philharmonia, on wonderful form, were urgently responsive to every flicker of timbre and nuance. The soloists were tremendous: the pianist, Paul Crossley, was wistfully reflective and teasing by turns; the trumpeter, Haken Hardenberger, was electrifying. </p> <p>Dohnanyi prefaced the Requiem with Mozart's Symphony No 25, a curious performance, hampered by a certain reticence. It is an inherently wild work in which enlightenment values collapse into a voice to be replaced by emotional violence. The first movement, in which the brass seems to pursue the strings in some sort of savage hunt, is particularly terrifying. Dohnanyi, throughout, seemed unwilling to let rip, while the Philharmonia's playing, though often energetic, was characterised at times by an almost clinical astringency. </p>",

Individuals who tested positive could still obtain insurance, but with a higher premium and restricted level of cover. </p> <p>But four of these tests have come under severe attack. The Royal Society told MPs that the selection of tests appeared \"arbitrary\" and this year the ABI admitted that four of the tests could no longer be considered reliable. </p> <p> The Prudential, in its submission to MPs, said that the tests for familiar adenoma tous polyposis and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy are irrelevant to insurers owing to their, typically, early onset; that for myotonic dystrophy it is, apparently, not sufficiently predictive, and multiple endochrine neoplasia has too wide an age of onset. </p> <p>The MPs concluded that: \"The ABI's decision that four of the tests it recommended insurers use for the past three years are no longer rel evant or reliable casts the gravest possible doubts on the validity of all the tests not explicitly approved by the [government's] genetics and insurance committee.\" </p> <p>But despite criticism from many corners, the ABI and big insurers are clinging on to their rights to take into account the results of tests for Huntington's disease, and are seeking approval for genetic tests on the early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. </p> <p>Mary Francis, director general of the ABI, said: \"We cannot lightly ignore information that tells us that someone applying for insurance is at significantly higher risk than the majority of policyholders. </p> <p>\"Applicants are normally charged according to the risk they bring to the pool of people insured - for instance, because of their age or their medical history.\" </p> <p>But the Alzheimer's Society, which has long campaigned against the use by insurers of genetic tests, called the MPs' report a \"strike against discrimination\" and urged the government to act swiftly to enforce a moratorium on tests. </p> <p>Harry Cayton, the society's chief executive, said: \"This report endorses a long-running Alzheimer's Society campaign against the use of genetic information by the insurance industry. </p> <p>\"I particularly welcome the concluding statement of the report, which states that for government and for our soci ety the choice is clear - expose people with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease to further stigma and discrimination or restrict access to genetic information by insurers. </p> <p>\"The industry case is based on bad science. They have continually made the spurious claim that they will be commercially damaged if prevented from using the results of genetic tests. This is untrue. </p> <p>\"I hope that the insurance industry and the government will act on these recommendations swiftly and that people will no longer be deterred from seeking genetic tests or from volunteering to take part in medical and scientific research for fear of future discrimination.\" </p> <p>A curious fact emerging from the committee's report was the tiny volume of genetic testing. For example, Prudential dealt with seven applications involving genetic test data in 2000; Norwich Union, 50 out of 150,000 applicants for insurance in 2000; and the CIS only 14 out of 460,000 in three years. </p> <p><strong>Tests they want and ones they dropped</strong></p> <p>1. <strong> Huntington's disease: </strong> Test approved </p> <p>2.<strong> Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease : </strong> Pending approval </p> <p>3. <strong>Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: </strong> Pending approval </p> <p>4. <strong>Familiar adenomatous polyposis </strong> (may lead to colon cancer) : Abandoned </p> <p>5. <strong>Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy : </strong> Abandoned </p> <p>6. <strong>Myotonic dystrophy </strong>(form of muscle weakness): Abandoned </p> <p>7. <strong>Multiple endochrine neoplasia</strong> (disease of endochrine glands which can lead to kidney stones and stomach ulceration): Abandoned </p>",

The Prudential, in its submission to MPs, said that the tests for familiar adenoma tous polyposis and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy are irrelevant to insurers owing to their, typically, early onset; that for myotonic dystrophy it is, apparently, not sufficiently predictive, and multiple endochrine neoplasia has too wide an age of onset. The MPs concluded that: \"The ABI's decision that four of the tests it recommended insurers use for the past three years are no longer rel evant or reliable casts the gravest possible doubts on the validity of all the tests not explicitly approved by the [government's] genetics and insurance committee.\" But despite criticism from many corners, the ABI and big insurers are clinging on to their rights to take into account the results of tests for Huntington's disease, and are seeking approval for genetic tests on the early onset of familial Alzheimer's disease and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Mary Francis, director general of the ABI, said: \"We cannot lightly ignore information that tells us that someone applying for insurance is at significantly higher risk than the majority of policyholders. \"Applicants are normally charged according to the risk they bring to the pool of people insured - for instance, because of their age or their medical history.\" But the Alzheimer's Society, which has long campaigned against the use by insurers of genetic tests, called the MPs' report a \"strike against discrimination\" and urged the government to act swiftly to enforce a moratorium on tests. Harry Cayton, the society's chief executive, said: \"This report endorses a long-running Alzheimer's Society campaign against the use of genetic information by the insurance industry. \"I particularly welcome the concluding statement of the report, which states that for government and for our soci ety the choice is clear - expose people with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease to further stigma and discrimination or restrict access to genetic information by insurers. \"The industry case is based on bad science. They have continually made the spurious claim that they will be commercially damaged if prevented from using the results of genetic tests. This is untrue. \"I hope that the insurance industry and the government will act on these recommendations swiftly and that people will no longer be deterred from seeking genetic tests or from volunteering to take part in medical and scientific research for fear of future discrimination.\" A curious fact emerging from the committee's report was the tiny volume of genetic testing. For example, Prudential dealt with seven applications involving genetic test data in 2000; Norwich Union, 50 out of 150,000 applicants for insurance in 2000; and the CIS only 14 out of 460,000 in three years. Tests they want and ones they dropped 1. Huntington's disease: Test approved 2. Early onset familial Alzheimer's disease : Pending approval 3. Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer: Pending approval 4. Familiar adenomatous polyposis (may lead to colon cancer) : Abandoned 5. Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy : Abandoned 6. Myotonic dystrophy (form of muscle weakness): Abandoned 7. Multiple endochrine neoplasia (disease of endochrine glands which can lead to kidney stones and stomach ulceration): Abandoned",

Software firms, in particular, are being culled nearly as fast as the livestock on England's pastures. </p> <p>But there is nothing parochial about the plague that has hit paper wealth. It is a global trend and one of the more threatening, particularly for the UK, with its reliance on international trade and financial deals. </p> <p>It is mainly warnings of harder times from US-based companies that have been pushing share prices down. So far there has been a deafening silence from Marconi and little news from BT's ruffled board. Even among UK software firms, it is usually smaller and unprofitable ones that admit that trading is poor. </p> <p>British industrial leaders mostly feel that the virus of recession is not affecting them. This may be because several have been selling out to foreign buyers. At the other end of the scale, jobs are still readily available in the most populous areas and house prices keep augmenting wealth. </p> <p>But the midweek rebound in share prices looks like what a Wall Street wit in the middle of a past recession termed a \"dead cat bounce\". </p> <p>In the City there is no sign of panic. After several fat years, one lean one can be absorbed without too much pain. Banks, property issues and some other old-economy stocks are much higher than they were a year ago, thanks to buoyant consumer spending and borrowing. </p> <p> However, smaller companies with limited cash resources are beginning to feel the pinch. That is affecting the trusts invested in them. The smaller company sectors of unit and investment trusts that sometimes made a killing in a single stock, such as BATM or Recognition Systems in the case of star performers, AIM Trust and Finsbury Technology, are finding life much harder now, even though sales were made close to peak prices in some such cases. Funds such as Eaglet, which has bought large stakes of more than 10% in some companies, may be hard put to sell at a reasonable price as the bear market deepens. </p> <p>The end is nigh for some investment trusts that leaped on the internet bubble but borrowed from banks to \"gear up\" their income and hoped-for growth. Split trusts, where part of the fixed capital is in zero coupon preference shares entitled to first repayment at a rising price in place of dividends, are near the point where or dinary shareholders may have little hope of recouping losses. </p> <p>Framlington NetNet and European Technology and Income Trust, which, along with Amerindo Internet, are valued at a small fraction of their issue prices just over a year ago, have paid back bank loans as the technology market collapsed. </p> <p>Even if prices in the sector were to stage a strong rebound, the ordinary shares would only recover a fraction of their losses now that the gearing has gone. </p> <p>Among conventional investment trusts, particularly those with broad European stakes, the appearance of large discounts presents a buying opportunity. But the converse applies to those investment trust shares that, surprisingly, still stand at premiums above their underlying values. </p> <p>The real giants of the investment world, the life assurers' managed funds that invest for the long term, are now showing the pressure. </p> <p>Until last month's further slide in markets, balanced funds - with a spread of holdings, the great majority in equities, but with some gilt-edged and other fixed interest holdings - were still showing scattered gains over the last year. </p> <p>Now the billions managed by the Prudential, Standard Life and the rest with balanced general funds managed for the benefit of bondholders, pension savers and other medium and longer-term investors, are suffering from the general equity market setback. That is why annual bonus rates are down and likely to remain at no more than 6%, around half the level that savers in this medium have became accustomed to. In times of low inflation that is a good return. The overwhelming consensus has it that inflation will remain low. That might need calling in question before the year is out. </p> <p>In a destructive and disaster-prone world, more shocks are likely. </p>",

Software firms, in particular, are being culled nearly as fast as the livestock on England's pastures. But there is nothing parochial about the plague that has hit paper wealth. It is a global trend and one of the more threatening, particularly for the UK, with its reliance on international trade and financial deals. It is mainly warnings of harder times from US-based companies that have been pushing share prices down. So far there has been a deafening silence from Marconi and little news from BT's ruffled board. Even among UK software firms, it is usually smaller and unprofitable ones that admit that trading is poor. British industrial leaders mostly feel that the virus of recession is not affecting them. This may be because several have been selling out to foreign buyers. At the other end of the scale, jobs are still readily available in the most populous areas and house prices keep augmenting wealth. But the midweek rebound in share prices looks like what a Wall Street wit in the middle of a past recession termed a \"dead cat bounce\". In the City there is no sign of panic. After several fat years, one lean one can be absorbed without too much pain. Banks, property issues and some other old-economy stocks are much higher than they were a year ago, thanks to buoyant consumer spending and borrowing. However, smaller companies with limited cash resources are beginning to feel the pinch. That is affecting the trusts invested in them. The smaller company sectors of unit and investment trusts that sometimes made a killing in a single stock, such as BATM or Recognition Systems in the case of star performers, AIM Trust and Finsbury Technology, are finding life much harder now, even though sales were made close to peak prices in some such cases. Funds such as Eaglet, which has bought large stakes of more than 10% in some companies, may be hard put to sell at a reasonable price as the bear market deepens. The end is nigh for some investment trusts that leaped on the internet bubble but borrowed from banks to \"gear up\" their income and hoped-for growth. Split trusts, where part of the fixed capital is in zero coupon preference shares entitled to first repayment at a rising price in place of dividends, are near the point where or dinary shareholders may have little hope of recouping losses. Framlington NetNet and European Technology and Income Trust, which, along with Amerindo Internet, are valued at a small fraction of their issue prices just over a year ago, have paid back bank loans as the technology market collapsed. Even if prices in the sector were to stage a strong rebound, the ordinary shares would only recover a fraction of their losses now that the gearing has gone. Among conventional investment trusts, particularly those with broad European stakes, the appearance of large discounts presents a buying opportunity. But the converse applies to those investment trust shares that, surprisingly, still stand at premiums above their underlying values. The real giants of the investment world, the life assurers' managed funds that invest for the long term, are now showing the pressure. Until last month's further slide in markets, balanced funds - with a spread of holdings, the great majority in equities, but with some gilt-edged and other fixed interest holdings - were still showing scattered gains over the last year. Now the billions managed by the Prudential, Standard Life and the rest with balanced general funds managed for the benefit of bondholders, pension savers and other medium and longer-term investors, are suffering from the general equity market setback. That is why annual bonus rates are down and likely to remain at no more than 6%, around half the level that savers in this medium have became accustomed to. In times of low inflation that is a good return. The overwhelming consensus has it that inflation will remain low. That might need calling in question before the year is out. In a destructive and disaster-prone world, more shocks are likely.",

      "body": "<p> Quite a few changes this week - from sunny Australia to rather cold and rainy New Zealand, from shorts and t-shirts to long trousers and jumpers, from backpacker buses to posh cars (I am on my third - Ace Car Rentals must rue the day I walked through the door).</p> <p>My last day in Australia was spent with Simon and Yuki who live in the Northern Beaches area of Sydney. I wonder if my house will look like theirs when I get back - full of beautiful things acquired from my travels around the world. I doubt it, as I can't match the view over the forest and the sea or Yuki's wonderful sculptures. I gather from friends' emails that my house has been rechristened 'the party house', but is still standing. </p> <p>I spent Saturday beach-hopping on the bus. I seem to have developed a fascination with watching surfers - the long wait for the right wave, the tumble at the end (or the beginning if they're not so good) and then the long swim back out, dipping under the waves as they crash down. I sat on a clifftop watching for hours. That night we went to the cinema to see Traffic - my first film for four months - and followed it up with some delicious Italian gellato. I should have known that a scoop each of pistachio, choc-chip and tiramisu would be too much but I gave it my best shot.</p> <p>The next day, Sunday, I set off for Auckland. The plane was going on to Buenos Aires and my South American neighbour during the journey gave me plenty of tips about where to go in Argentina. In Auckland I was again lucky enough to be staying with John and Lucy and their family - friends of a friend in Ely, where Lucy used to live before emigrating. I was going to set off south on Monday, but the relentless heavy rain that met me off the plane continued, so instead I went into Auckland to see about hiring a car and to find a 'teach yourself Spanish' tape to listen to while driving. I had to go back at four to pick up the car. We sorted out the paperwork and I got in, only to discover that it was an automatic. Since I've never driven one before I asked to change to a normal car, but that meant redoing all the paperwork. By the time I finally set off in car number two it was dark, and still pouring with rain. I suddenly realised that I didn't have a clue how to find John and Lucy's house. After a few fruitless attempts to consult a map which only had tourist spots marked on it, I somehow managed to end up in the right district. Then began a long and panicky search to try and find their road, which seemed to have completely vanished - if indeed it ever existed. A hunt for the piece of paper with their phone number on also proved fruitless. I eventually arrived back at 7pm, to great relief all round.</p> <p>It was still raining on Tuesday morning, but I set off regardless. It was only then that I noticed the hole where the radio/cassette player should be. The rain eventually stopped at about 11am, and the sun came out. I drove to Rotorua, nicknamed 'sulpher city' as it's the centre of an active thermal area. I booked myself on to a Maori dance and hangi tour for the evening and had a quick look at the huge Rotorua Lake and Kuirah Park near the hostel.</p> <p>The tour to a Maori village complex, run entirely by Maoris, was excellent. As you may have gathered I'm not too keen on organised coach tours to cultural centres, but this had a genuine feel to it that raised it above the odd Butlins-type moments. The performers welcomed us in traditional manner, and the music and dance performance - including a fearsome haka - were good. The hangi food cooked in earth ovens was delicious, with as much as you could eat. With a full stomach and plenty of wine, I could even bear the singing on the coach back.</p> <p>Wednesday was a long day of driving, with lots of breaks to go sightseeing. First stop was Waiotapu, an area rich in thermal activity. I arrived in time to see the Lady Knox geyser go off on the dot of 10.15, aided by a dose of biodegradable soap which apparantly breaks down the surface tension and sets off the 50ft high plume. I then walked around the pools, craters and steaming fumerols, all different colours due to the chemical elements - the purples, emerald greens, blues and reds of the rocks and the water were unreal in their brightness. I have never before been to an area like this, where you can almost imagine that you're looking down into the centre of the earth. It makes you aware of how fragile and alive the ground we stand on really is. Quite an experience.</p> <p>I set off next for the huge Lake Taupo, driving around it to Turangi on the other side for lunch. I decided to carry on taking the scenic route through Tongariro National Park. It was a beautiful drive past the snow-capped Mount Ruapetu volcano, and up, down and round the hills to Ohakune. I had thought of stopping there and doing one of the short walks, but the town seemed to have shut down - even the park office was closed at 3pm - so I started off again for Wanganui, a town on the Whanganui river (extra 'h' for the river). This wasn't much livelier. I spent a frustrating hour trying to find a telephone, an email facility and a cafe - failing on all three counts. I did find a Chinese takeaway to take back to the hostel and eventually managed to get on the one phone there to tell Mike and Clare, my travelling companions around India, that I was arriving in Wellington the next day.</p> <p>Thursday was another day spent driving down the coast road to Wellington. Not long into the day my car suddenly but briefly made a horrible noise and the steering seemed to change. I stopped and checked the tyres and opened the bonnet. This is always a rather pointless exercise for me, as I doubt I'd even be able to tell if the whole engine had dropped out. No sign of anything wrong so I carried on cautiously. This time I managed to find Mike and Clare's house without trauma. I had unknowingly arrived on Mike's birthday. We did a tour of Wellington by night, driving up a mountain where you could see the whole city and bay lit up - a magnificent view. Back to their house for lots of lamb and wine and reminiscences about India.</p> <p>Clare and Mike said goodbye and set off for work at an unearthly hour the following morning. I decided to have just five more minutes in bed before heading into Wellington and a net cafe. An hour later I woke, hastily threw my bags into the car and closed their door behind me. The engine was dead, not a splutter. Cursing all cars the world over, I knocked on the door of a neighbour and asked to use the phone to call the AA. I got back in the car to wait, tried the engine again and - yes, you've guessed it - it started perfectly. I drove off to find a phone to cancel the call-out and then headed straight for the Wellington branch of Ace. I was almost relieved when he told me that the power-steering belt was completely mangled and he had never known this happen before. At least it wasn't my imagination. I'm now on car number three. They seem to get bigger each time - a far cry from my little Fiesta at home. A different car meant that I had to go and change my ticket for the ferry to the South Island which included details about my car. </p> <p>All in all, then, it was a bit of a frustrating day and I doubt now whether I'll have time to go to the Te Papa Museum of New Zealand. Hopefully I can do it on the way back. I have deliberately rushed down through the North Island to get across to the South before the schools break up. From now I intend to travel more slowly and do more active things (but no bungy jumping). The plan is to see more of the North Island on the way back. I have been impressed by the beauty of New Zealand, if not by it's climate. It is still very strange to see trees losing their leaves and to think that winter is coming. My own fault for not even considering seasons when I planned my route. How many cars will I get through next week? Maybe tour buses aren't such a bad thing...</p>",

      "bodyText": "Quite a few changes this week - from sunny Australia to rather cold and rainy New Zealand, from shorts and t-shirts to long trousers and jumpers, from backpacker buses to posh cars (I am on my third - Ace Car Rentals must rue the day I walked through the door). My last day in Australia was spent with Simon and Yuki who live in the Northern Beaches area of Sydney. I wonder if my house will look like theirs when I get back - full of beautiful things acquired from my travels around the world. I doubt it, as I can't match the view over the forest and the sea or Yuki's wonderful sculptures. I gather from friends' emails that my house has been rechristened 'the party house', but is still standing. I spent Saturday beach-hopping on the bus. I seem to have developed a fascination with watching surfers - the long wait for the right wave, the tumble at the end (or the beginning if they're not so good) and then the long swim back out, dipping under the waves as they crash down. I sat on a clifftop watching for hours. That night we went to the cinema to see Traffic - my first film for four months - and followed it up with some delicious Italian gellato. I should have known that a scoop each of pistachio, choc-chip and tiramisu would be too much but I gave it my best shot. The next day, Sunday, I set off for Auckland. The plane was going on to Buenos Aires and my South American neighbour during the journey gave me plenty of tips about where to go in Argentina. In Auckland I was again lucky enough to be staying with John and Lucy and their family - friends of a friend in Ely, where Lucy used to live before emigrating. I was going to set off south on Monday, but the relentless heavy rain that met me off the plane continued, so instead I went into Auckland to see about hiring a car and to find a 'teach yourself Spanish' tape to listen to while driving. I had to go back at four to pick up the car. We sorted out the paperwork and I got in, only to discover that it was an automatic. Since I've never driven one before I asked to change to a normal car, but that meant redoing all the paperwork. By the time I finally set off in car number two it was dark, and still pouring with rain. I suddenly realised that I didn't have a clue how to find John and Lucy's house. After a few fruitless attempts to consult a map which only had tourist spots marked on it, I somehow managed to end up in the right district.

      "body": "<p>The first few days of this week I was still a working girl, and I think you've got the general gist of how that goes. Crazy hours but good food and good company. In fact I was almost sad to be leaving Coogee, although I have decided to come for 10 days at the end of April - definitely not an event I would have foreseen way back in England. Travelling is full of surprises. </p> <p>Sunday April 1 was officially my last day at work for 19 days - quite a cheeky length holiday when you consider I'm on a three-month contract, but as long as they're happy I'm very happy! That evening me and Josh could actually celebrate safe in the knowledge the alarm wouldn't go at 3am the next morning. We headed to a Thai restaurant for dinner - the food type I eat most, of which will make actually being in Thailand an interesting culinary experience. The meal was delicious, as ever, and the fact that I didn't lose my taste buds through excess chilli consumption was an added bonus. </p> <p>The bizarre thing about the next day is that I almost felt gloomy. I saw it as some kind of post-work comedown where my body clock was thrown into confusion by still being in bed at 6 in the morning. I assure you I have quickly adjusted! Early afternoon we caught the harbour ferry across to Watson's Bay despite the rain. We had lunch at Doyle's, an old and famous fish restaurant/pub where I amused our waitress by requesting a child's fish and chips meal - which was outstanding value and came complete with ice-cream covered in hundreds and thousands. The real lunch highlight was undoubtedly the view from the window across the harbour to the grey outline of the city skyline. After lunch we wandered round the national park but had to pause regularly under bushes to shelter from the rain. </p> <p>Tuesday was a big day for me - the day I packed up my bag and said goodbye to Coogee and the life I'd had there. Unsurprisingly I had mixed feelings - some sad because I guess a small piece of my heart will always be there, as in all my homes, but some excited as I'm no longer certain what the future will hold. I'm a real traveller again! The flight to Christchurch, on New Zealand's South Island was short and sweet. At the airport we randomly chose Cokers Hostel as our first stay and I'd say it's a very decent place, set on Manchester Street - one of many comparisons between Christchurch and England. That afternoon on a total impulse I got my hair cut and highlighted blonde - I'd been through so many changes these last few days I decided to get the whole lot done at once. They say a change is as good as a start so who knows what will happen next? Do (slightly) blondes have more fun?! </p> <p>A brief exploration of Christchurch showed it to be totally different from Sydney in lay-out and atmosphere. It seems relaxed, a lot flatter skyline-wise, and more like an English town. After eating take-away that evening (I'm yet to break into cooking again) we headed out to see what the night life was like. To be honest it was very quiet, though a lot of this was probably due to it being a Tuesday night. We tried two excellently named pubs: the Grumpy Mole and the Loaded Hog, but besides the latter giving us a beer the size of my arm it was a particularly mellow evening. </p> <p>In the morning we rose early to explore Christchurch properly as this was to be our second and last day there. After having a massive take-away salad we decided to hire a couple of bikes. The rest of the day was spent cycling beside an enclosed area of water that leads to the Pacific Ocean enjoying the fresh air and exercise. </p> <p>Now, I know it's only been two days but I'd like to end the website New Zealand debate now for once and for all. This country is wonderful. Today was the most perfect day imaginable; the air was clean, the sky was blue and it felt like a gorgeous spring day in England (yes I know it's autumn here). There was no hint of cloud, grey or rain and cycling beside the water on excellent cycle lanes, passing idyllic hillside dwellings I couldn't have felt happier or more peaceful. Stopping for a picnic by the grey sands of Sumner Beach it occurred to me this is a place I would happily live. The people are exceptionally friendly. Debate over. We've booked a coach to Arthur's Pass tomorrow, as someone wrote it to recommend, although we've decided to forsake all organised coach tours in favour of doing it ourselves, so I'll keep you posted on how that's working out. </p> <p>Until next week (when no doubt I'll still be loving the South Island)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Cape Maclear's beach boys were becoming too much of an irritation (see <a href=\"http://travel.theguardian.com/netjetters/sam/story/0,7452,465092,00.html\">last week's report</a>), and it was time to leave. We booked ourselves into Mvuu safari camp in Liwonde National Park to do a bit of game spotting. We needed to be in Liwonde to catch the boat transfer at 11.30am.</p> <p>However, getting out of Cape Maclear wasn't going to be easy. There was no public transport and part of the road had been washed away by the floods earlier in the week. One of the locals, Bruce, said he could arrange a lift for us all the way to Liwonde. But on the morning of our departure, Bruce turned up empty-handed. Unfortunately his car was 'broken', but he could get us a lift with a friend. The price would have to double though. We rejected this (H made her feelings very clear), and set out to make our own way. We found a ride in the back of a bumpy pick-up truck and crawled gingerly to the main road. There we caught a bus. Like all African buses it was incredibly slow and seemed to stop every 100 yards. It was also packed full with screaming babies, squawking chickens, rotting fish and the radio was playing at full volume. We eventually made it to Liwonde town, three hours late, saddle sore, having missed our boat.</p> <p>Liwonde was like every other Malawi town we'd seen. An assortment of shacks and stalls strung out along the road offering everything from tailoring to used tyres to bottle shops. As the bus pulled in it was besieged by market traders trying to sell fast food to the remaining bus passengers. I saw a man in a ragged T-shirt carrying a tray of roasted sparrows. Another was banging the windows and offering bowls of peanuts.</p> <p>We pushed through the throng, struggling with our rucksacks and crossed over the river to the other shore. A small jetty was the pick-up point for the transfer to Mvuu camp. We were relieved to find a Dutch couple waiting there. They told us that another boat should be along soon.</p> <p>Shortly a small motor boat buzzed around a corner of the river and coasted up to the jetty. We clambered aboard and sped off up the Shire river, skimming the waves and into the park.</p> <p>Liwonde National Park is one of the best in Malawi. While you don't get the numbers and variety of animals that you might see in other parks in Africa, it is well managed and your are virtually guaranteed to see elephants, crocodiles and hippos. Mvuu camp is the only place you can stay in the park. It's managed by Central African Wilderness Safari and lies deep in the central African Wilderness Safaris in the northern part of the park on the banks of the Shire.</p> <p>Our first sight of the camp above the reeds was the large thatched restaurant fronting a long grassy slope down to the river. Two large <a href=\"http://www.butterflyproduction.com/Photos/Africa/pages/Baobab%20tree.htm\" target=\"_new\">baobab trees</a> provided shade.</p> <p>Getting off the boat we were met by one of the Wilderness management team, who told us that as it was low season and midweek we were being upgraded to the luxury lodge. Now very excited, we were driven through the bush, glimpsing impala and scampering monkeys along the way, and shown through the jungle to our secluded accommodation. We had a large, walk-in covered tent with a double bed and a wooden balcony overlooking a lush watering hole full of birds. There was a beautiful bathroom in a stone-built area adjoining the tent. This, unbelieveably, had a sunken bath and freshly laundered, fluffy robes and towels. H and I jumped around the tent hugging each other in disbelief. </p> <p>This was the start of a fabulous relaxing three days of fine food, game viewing and lazing on the veranda. Our first activity that afternoon was a boat trip further up the river in search of wildlife. Our guides, Jim and Paul, quickly found a group of hippos submerged near the bank, just their nostrils, ears and eyes above the surface. They stared at us unblinkingly, snorting plumes of spray into the air. Jim said we needed to be careful and not get too close as one of the cows had a baby. You do not want to get between an over-protective 2,000kg mother and her child. When one of the hippos dived and we saw a line of bubbles ominously moving towards us, Jim opened up the throttle and we sped away. We saw more hippos, crocodiles and an amazing variety of rainbow-coloured birdlife. Taking us out into midstream, Jim switched off the motor and opened the coolbox for our 'sundownders'. Sitting back, we sipped gin and tonics and exchanged travel stories with our fellow passengers. </p> <p>Back at the lodge, we luxuriated in our sunken tub before a delicious dinner in the thatched restaurant overlooking the crocodile infested river. We were joined by the camp manager Chris who told us about life in Malawi.</p> <p>That night, tucked up in our huge bed we were gently being lolled to sleep by the croaking frogs outside when a loud snorting noise made up jump. A hippo had emerged from the water and was blundering up track alongside our tent. Terrified, we cowered under the sheets until it moved off. We didn't get that much sleep, but when did drop off our dreams were full of man-eating hippos.</p> <p>The following days continued in the same wonderful vein. We went for early morning wildlife walks and tracked impala and water buck. There were more leisurely boat trips and sundowners on the river. The staff at the lodge were wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble - we even got our laundry washed and pressed.</p> <p>The only thing I was disappointed about was not seeing an elephant. It was so wet that they did not need to come to the river for water. The last herd had been seen over three weeks ago. But, on the morning of our last day, Jim took us down the river again. We were watching the hippos floating about and occasionally yawning when Jim suddenly pointed - \"Look! elephants swimming!\" His eyesight was incredible. Even with binoculars it was a long time before I managed to spot the dark shapes moving in the water. As we got closer, we could see it was a herd of 12, including two young ones. Most were grazing among the trees but three big males were splashing each other in the shallows. We watched spellbound as the huge graceful grey creatures slowly walked out of the water and back into the trees.</p> <p>It was my deep desire to see elephants that had made me send in my entry to the Netjetters competition all those months ago. Seeing them at last, and the last few days at Mvuu has been the highlight of my trip so far.</p> <p>We left the lodge extremely reluctantly. We had had a magical time and hope to return one day.</p> <p>Tomorrow we catch a 1940s steamboat up the lake to the north.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Express owner Richard Desmond has been warned that the multimillion pound Westferry printing plant dispute will only be settled if he gives assurances about future payment of bills. Mr Desmond is holding out for an \u00a311m dividend from the plant, which he co-owns with Daily Telegraph owner Hollinger International, and is refusing to pay a \u00a36m printing bill in the meantime. The Express owner has told colleagues he is confident that Hollinger boss Conrad Black will cough up between \u00a34 and 5m in the \"next four or five days\". However, senior executives at Hollinger today said relations between both parties have reached such a low that they cannot trust Mr Desmond and Northern &amp; Shell Company anymore. Dan Colson, vice-chairman of Hollinger, said the dividend will be paid if Northern &amp; Shell promise to pay bills on time. \"If we can find a way to ensure that they will pay their bills to date and on an ongoing basis, then we will be willing to pay a dividend,\" said Mr Colson. Mr Colson added that a court battle is imminent, because he believes Northern &amp; Shell will not respond to Hollinger's demands. \"I don't think they will be able to do what we are proposing, so I think a writ will be issued against them at the beginning of next week,\" he said. Today's developments still leave the ownership of the plant up in the air. Hollinger has agreed to buy Mr Desmond's 50% stake in Westferry, but the companies cannot agree on a price. Northern &amp; Shell is demanding \u00a380m for its holding in the lucrative business, whereas Hollinger will only offer \u00a330m. Mr Desmond has offered ex-QC Anthony Evans as an arbitrator, but Hollinger wants the price to be settled by accountancy professionals and not by lawyers. A Northern &amp; Shell insider today said the company is confident Hollinger will pay the dividend, regardless of assurances about prompt settlement of bills. \"We are very confident that they will pay,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>The case of the United States plane that was forced to make an emergency landing in China was not the only Sino-American imbroglio to have taken place this week. A few days earlier, Chinese security services brought to three the number of international scholars they have arrested over the past month on charges of spying, and in the process sent a shiver down the spines of many researchers in Hong Kong. One of the arrested academics is a naturalised American, another enjoys permanent residency rights in the US. The remaining scholar is an Oxford PhD who is based in Hong Kong but was doing research at two institutions in nearby Guangzhou.</p> <p>\"Theories and questions are whizzing through the websites on which China experts communicate,\" noted Jonathan Mirsky, a China analyst, in an op-ed piece published in the <strong>International Herald Tribune</strong>. \"Are any of the prisoners really spies? Are their arrests random? Are they to warn Mr Bush not to harden his policies towards China? Are Mrs Gao and Mr Li being held as hostages, to be released in exchange for the Chinese colonel who recently defected to the United States? Are the authorities trying to deter Chinese-born scholars who live abroad from pursuing 'sensitive' research inside China?\" As a matter of fact, Mr Mirsky wasn't sure of any likely answers himself.</p> <p>Another East Asian educational row grew stronger this week after internet users in South Korea crippled at least six Japanese websites by logging on en masse to protest against the Japanese government's decision to authorise the controversial publication of eight high school history textbooks. The nationalist editors of the books have revised some 137 generally accepted facts about Japan's wartime history. </p> <p>The books now claim that Japan \"liberated\" Asia, particularly Korea and China, from Western colonisers during the first half of the last century, while omitting any mention of the thousands of Asian women who were abducted and raped by Japanese soldiers or else forced to work at Japanese factories.</p> <p>An editorial in the <strong>Korea Herald</strong> quoted from the words of Shigehiko Hasumi, the president of the University of Tokyo, who said that such efforts by his own countrymen to distort history may give the Japanese people \"a little satisfaction\" but it will never enable them to pass on the courage to mould their future. \"History cannot be erased,\" the paper said. \"Neither can it be the subject of deception. This is why many Japanese intellectuals and civic group leaders are joining hands with Korean and Chinese in condemning the repeated statements of Japanese politicians to justify and glorify their wartime atrocities.\"</p> <p>No such protest looks likely in Zimbabwe, where the government of Robert Mugabe has announced that foreign (read: British) examinations will be scrapped in the public education system, effective from next year, as part of its ongoing quest to \"decolonise\" former Rhodesia.</p> <p>A long editorial published in the <strong>Zimbabwe Independent</strong> began by pointing out that, curiously enough, the same \"black elite\" that favours the creation of a more localised culture has not hesitated to send its own offspring to private institutions where teachers tend to be white, English the preferred language of instruction and examinations decidedly British. </p> <p>\"It is difficult to take a long, hard look at the education ministry without a touch of pathos,\" the newspaper said. The ministry's \"ban on foreign exams has the look of cultural assertion - for the first time Zimbabweans will set and mark all examinations - but it hasn't escaped notice that Zanu PF is a party battling for survival and will do anything to spite Britain.\"</p> <p>The University of Sydney, in Australia, has granted an honorary degree to a businessman who, by a remarkable coincidence, also helped secure a A$1.2m grant to establish the university's first chair of pharmacy practice.

      "bodyText": "The case of the United States plane that was forced to make an emergency landing in China was not the only Sino-American imbroglio to have taken place this week. A few days earlier, Chinese security services brought to three the number of international scholars they have arrested over the past month on charges of spying, and in the process sent a shiver down the spines of many researchers in Hong Kong. One of the arrested academics is a naturalised American, another enjoys permanent residency rights in the US. The remaining scholar is an Oxford PhD who is based in Hong Kong but was doing research at two institutions in nearby Guangzhou. \"Theories and questions are whizzing through the websites on which China experts communicate,\" noted Jonathan Mirsky, a China analyst, in an op-ed piece published in the International Herald Tribune. \"Are any of the prisoners really spies? Are their arrests random? Are they to warn Mr Bush not to harden his policies towards China? Are Mrs Gao and Mr Li being held as hostages, to be released in exchange for the Chinese colonel who recently defected to the United States? Are the authorities trying to deter Chinese-born scholars who live abroad from pursuing 'sensitive' research inside China?\" As a matter of fact, Mr Mirsky wasn't sure of any likely answers himself. Another East Asian educational row grew stronger this week after internet users in South Korea crippled at least six Japanese websites by logging on en masse to protest against the Japanese government's decision to authorise the controversial publication of eight high school history textbooks. The nationalist editors of the books have revised some 137 generally accepted facts about Japan's wartime history. The books now claim that Japan \"liberated\" Asia, particularly Korea and China, from Western colonisers during the first half of the last century, while omitting any mention of the thousands of Asian women who were abducted and raped by Japanese soldiers or else forced to work at Japanese factories. An editorial in the Korea Herald quoted from the words of Shigehiko Hasumi, the president of the University of Tokyo, who said that such efforts by his own countrymen to distort history may give the Japanese people \"a little satisfaction\" but it will never enable them to pass on the courage to mould their future. \"History cannot be erased,\" the paper said. \"Neither can it be the subject of deception. This is why many Japanese intellectuals and civic group leaders are joining hands with Korean and Chinese in condemning the repeated statements of Japanese politicians to justify and glorify their wartime atrocities.\" No such protest looks likely in Zimbabwe, where the government of Robert Mugabe has announced that foreign (read: British) examinations will be scrapped in the public education system, effective from next year, as part of its ongoing quest to \"decolonise\" former Rhodesia. A long editorial published in the Zimbabwe Independent began by pointing out that, curiously enough, the same \"black elite\" that favours the creation of a more localised culture has not hesitated to send its own offspring to private institutions where teachers tend to be white, English the preferred language of instruction and examinations decidedly British. \"It is difficult to take a long, hard look at the education ministry without a touch of pathos,\" the newspaper said. The ministry's \"ban on foreign exams has the look of cultural assertion - for the first time Zimbabweans will set and mark all examinations - but it hasn't escaped notice that Zanu PF is a party battling for survival and will do anything to spite Britain.\" The University of Sydney, in Australia, has granted an honorary degree to a businessman who, by a remarkable coincidence, also helped secure a A$1.2m grant to establish the university's first chair of pharmacy practice. On the same day, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the practice of awarding honorary degrees to people who have not put in the expected years of academic slog (or have risen to great social status) is becoming an increasingly common feature across many of the nation's 39 cash-strapped universities. Still, things could be worse. If you have tears, prepare to shed them for the sons of Michael Schwartz.

The Sri Lankan-born respiratory specialist was said to be devastated by the loss.</p> <p>Postmortem examinations were carried out yesterday. Although the toxicology results will not be available until later today at the earliest, it is understood that the deaths were caused by overdoses of prescribed drugs.</p> <p>No note was found at the scene, but Thames Valley police confirmed that no one was being sought in connection with the deaths, which are being treated as suicide. According to police sources, it was clear from the scene that both knew what they were doing.</p> <p>As neighbours in the cul-de-sac of Prides Crossing, North Ascot, came to terms with the news, it emerged that Mrs Gunwardena, 45, an accountant with British Airways until contracting ME, had suffered from bouts of severe depression brought on by the illness.</p> <p>Keshan, described as a brilliant and polite boy who was at home on his Easter break from Eton, had become increasingly distressed by his mother's condition.</p> <p>One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: \"Keshan had been a boarder at Eton College which meant that his mother did not have to look after him day in day out, as she did when he was at the prep school.</p> <p>\"However, the boy broke up for the Easter holidays almost two weeks ago and was at home. I think he was quite up set at seeing how ill his mum had become.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, the family's \u00a3500,000 five bedroom home was deserted.</p> <p>The couple, who came to Britain in the 1970s from Sri Lanka, moved into the cul-de-sac in 1997, and were described by neighbours as friendly but quiet.</p> <p>After spells as a hospital consultant, Dr Gunawardena was the clinical research director of Chiltern International, a Slough-based company specialising in testing drugs for the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p>Keshan, an only child, was in his first year as a boarder at Eton after winning a King's Scholarship - instituted in the 15th century by Henry VI - in May last year.</p> <p>Rhidian Llewellyn, headmaster of Papplewick prep school in Ascot, which Keshan attended before Eton, described him as a very hard worker and a great games player who had pushed himself to perform academically.</p> <p>\"He came to this school at the age of seven and was a brilliant child. He was quiet and much loved by everybody.</p> <p>\"He was his own person, self-contained and brilliant with computers.\"</p> <p>Mr Llewellyn said Mrs Gunawardena had been determined to widen her son's interests beyond computers but her illness often made her depressed.</p> <p>\"Keshan's mother had been unable to work for some time because of the ME. She was a lovely, gentle frail woman. Keshan would worry about her like any child.\"</p> <p>Eton College also paid tribute to the boy. The school's provost, Eric Anderson, said: \"We are very sad to hear about the death of him and his mother.

      "bodyText": "An Eton schoolboy and his mother have been found dead after a double suicide apparently prompted by the woman's debilitating battle with the chronic fatigue syndrome, ME. The bodies of Keshan Gunawardena, 13, and his mother, Dinesha, were found at their home in North Ascot, Berkshire, on Wednesday evening by the boy's father, Kulasiri, an eminent doctor and director of a clinical research company. Dr Gunawardena, 52, called an ambulance, but by the time paramedics arrived at the scene shortly after 6pm, both had died. The Sri Lankan-born respiratory specialist was said to be devastated by the loss. Postmortem examinations were carried out yesterday. Although the toxicology results will not be available until later today at the earliest, it is understood that the deaths were caused by overdoses of prescribed drugs. No note was found at the scene, but Thames Valley police confirmed that no one was being sought in connection with the deaths, which are being treated as suicide. According to police sources, it was clear from the scene that both knew what they were doing. As neighbours in the cul-de-sac of Prides Crossing, North Ascot, came to terms with the news, it emerged that Mrs Gunwardena, 45, an accountant with British Airways until contracting ME, had suffered from bouts of severe depression brought on by the illness. Keshan, described as a brilliant and polite boy who was at home on his Easter break from Eton, had become increasingly distressed by his mother's condition. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: \"Keshan had been a boarder at Eton College which meant that his mother did not have to look after him day in day out, as she did when he was at the prep school. \"However, the boy broke up for the Easter holidays almost two weeks ago and was at home. I think he was quite up set at seeing how ill his mum had become.\" Yesterday, the family's \u00a3500,000 five bedroom home was deserted. The couple, who came to Britain in the 1970s from Sri Lanka, moved into the cul-de-sac in 1997, and were described by neighbours as friendly but quiet. After spells as a hospital consultant, Dr Gunawardena was the clinical research director of Chiltern International, a Slough-based company specialising in testing drugs for the pharmaceutical industry. Keshan, an only child, was in his first year as a boarder at Eton after winning a King's Scholarship - instituted in the 15th century by Henry VI - in May last year. Rhidian Llewellyn, headmaster of Papplewick prep school in Ascot, which Keshan attended before Eton, described him as a very hard worker and a great games player who had pushed himself to perform academically. \"He came to this school at the age of seven and was a brilliant child. He was quiet and much loved by everybody. \"He was his own person, self-contained and brilliant with computers.\" Mr Llewellyn said Mrs Gunawardena had been determined to widen her son's interests beyond computers but her illness often made her depressed. \"Keshan's mother had been unable to work for some time because of the ME. She was a lovely, gentle frail woman. Keshan would worry about her like any child.\" Eton College also paid tribute to the boy. The school's provost, Eric Anderson, said: \"We are very sad to hear about the death of him and his mother. He had a very bright future.\" Neighbours greeted news of the deaths with disbelief yesterday. Harold Tew, who lives opposite the Gunawardenas, said the last time he had spoken to the family was at a Christmas drinks party organised by another resident. Mrs Gunawardena had shown no sign of depression, he said, mingling and chatting with the other guests, while her husband had been more reserved. Last night, Dr Gunawardena was being comforted by friends and relatives. A police spokesman said: \"He has taken this incident very badly and, not surprisingly, needs some time to come to terms with what has happened. We will be interviewing him to try to piece what went on at the house and will be preparing a full report for the East Berkshire coroner.\" A spokesman for Chiltern International said: \"We are very sad to hear the tragic news of the death of Dinesha and Keshan. Our sympathies go out to Dr Gunawardena and his family.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Sun sent a fake sheikh and its drug sniffer dog Charlie to greet Countess of Wessex at her very public engagement today. Stating his mission, Sun head of news Graham Dudman said Charlie's presence could have helped stand up the Mail on Sunday's cocaine allegations, and that 'Sophie likes talking to reporters dressed as sheikhs'. Reporter Nick Fagge, dressed in Arab gear accessorised with a Sun sash, was allowed into the press area but was flanked by two policemen throughout. His colleague, reporter Martin Wallace, accompanied Charlie. Neither he nor the hound was allowed anywhere near the royal couple. The police warned him he would be arrested if he went anywhere near them. Dudman said: 'Why wasn't the sniffer dog allowed near the royals? We take this very seriously.' Fagge asked the Countess how she was in Arabic but she did not respond. Dudman added: 'She was smiling at everyone but I think she was churning inside.' This is not Fagge's first foray into the dressing up box. He dressed up as a pussy cat and a butler to deliver fish and chips to the queen when mice were found in Buckingham Palace's kitchen. Dudman added: 'He's very versatile. I only employ people who can turn their hands to anything.'",

For sad historical reasons, the Yorkshire council has a mixture of grammars, former grant-maintained schools, strongly neighbourhood comps in outlying towns and what amount to secondary moderns, although everyone is trying to raise their game.</p> <p>The squeeze on parental choice is such that the Worralls' ace \u00d1 a sibling already at their first-choice school for Jamie \u00d1 has been trumped. Their elder son Lee is 13 and flourishing at Holy Trinity, but the CofE high school had 242 applications for 180 places. Lorraine can do the sums. But she and David are also counting on strength in numbers. \"There are five children in Jamie's class at the primary who now haven't got schools to go to \u00d1 who'll be staying behind when the others go off for the transition day at Holy Trinity or the other high schools,\" she says. Parents have been galvanised to tackle the appeals system, which involved writing three initial letters, fast.</p> <p>First, Lorraine politely turned down the four Calderdale offers, in spite of approaches from one of the schools, which she knows from living nearby in the past. She says: \"They said, \u00d4don't worry Lorraine, Jamie will be in an express class' [part of reforms to attract back motivated parents and groom promising students]. But I don't want him segregated like that. We're a normal family and he's a normal boy who's bright enough but doesn't want \u00d4expressing'. At that school, I'm scared that he'd either be segregated and maybe picked on, or dragged down with the rest \u00d1 which is why we moved away from there.\"</p> <p>The second letter went off to Wakefield diocese to get an appeal form, and the third was the form itself, sent to Holy Trinity, which runs its own appeals; the Worralls are expecting a date at the end of this month. Lorraine and David kept their case simple and direct. \"We had to,\" says Lorraine. \"There wasn't that much room.\"</p> <p>Lee's place at the school was one point; the other a strong and honest case for the family as active Church of England parents. In the squeeze on Holy Trinity, this is a key area of point-scoring; the family's initial application, refereed by their vicar whose own son is in Jamie's class and going to Holy Trinity, had to specify between types of church-going (the child alone, with family etc).</p> <p>The Worralls want to go every week, and Jamie does Bible class on Monday evenings; but David's continental shifts at work rule out a lot of Sunday mornings for him, and then there's football. Lorraine says: \"Jamie and Lee are really keen, but team practice is on Sunday morning at the same time as church.\" Like so many parents of three children (six-year-old Katie has all this to come) she is torn all ways.</p> <p>That's another of her appeal points; sending Jamie somewhere else will mean that two hard-working parents have children at three separate schools \u00d1 \"but I pride myself on having a very close family, and the children would benefit from being at the same school.\" She has tentatively approached the vicar about midweek worship, but it isn't yet a runner.</p> <p>So all eyes are back on the letterbox at the family's home in Pellon, Halifax, waiting for the appeals appointment to drop through. Meanwhile, the Worralls draw strength from neighbours with the same problem, and sympathetic primary teachers who warn: \"It's just never been this difficult before.\"</p>",

The Worralls want to go every week, and Jamie does Bible class on Monday evenings; but David's continental shifts at work rule out a lot of Sunday mornings for him, and then there's football. Lorraine says: \"Jamie and Lee are really keen, but team practice is on Sunday morning at the same time as church.\" Like so many parents of three children (six-year-old Katie has all this to come) she is torn all ways. That's another of her appeal points; sending Jamie somewhere else will mean that two hard-working parents have children at three separate schools \u00d1 \"but I pride myself on having a very close family, and the children would benefit from being at the same school.\" She has tentatively approached the vicar about midweek worship, but it isn't yet a runner. So all eyes are back on the letterbox at the family's home in Pellon, Halifax, waiting for the appeals appointment to drop through. Meanwhile, the Worralls draw strength from neighbours with the same problem, and sympathetic primary teachers who warn: \"It's just never been this difficult before.\"",

The prime minister, Tony Blair, was in Yorkshire reassuring potential visitors that the foot and mouth outbreak would not interfere with their holiday plans.</p> <p>The government today pledged \u00a3120m of guaranteed loans to the tourist industry, after ministers confirmed yesterday that bookings are down 10% across the country and up to 80% in areas of Cumbria and Devon.</p> <p>The initiative targets those businesses hit by cash-flow problems by offering loans of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Many rural businesses such as B&amp;Bs are already eligible for loans under this scheme, but the move means that businesses such as garages, restaurants and souvenir shops can also now apply.</p> <p>In addition, the maximum time for repayment will be increased by a year to 11 years, and capital repayment breaks will be increased from two to three years.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, went sailing on the Norfolk Broads today in an attempt to persuade tourists to return to the countryside. Mr Prescott was in Brundall, near Norwich, to meet officials from the Broads authority to discuss the problems facing the tourist industry in East Anglia.</p> <p>Many footpaths and mooring areas around the Broads are closed because of the disease, but Mr Prescott urged visitors to head to East Anglia this Easter, saying there was still lots of things to do.</p> <p>\"Even though some footpaths are closed there is still plenty to do and the countryside is still open,\" he said.</p> <p>The cabinet minister, Mo Mowlam, was visiting Warwick castle today to deliver a similar message.</p> <p>Cumbria county council was today removing road signs banning walkers from the countryside because the signs do not fit in with the \"open for business image\", the county council said.</p> <p>A committee concluded that the signs are \"absolutely necessary\" in the areas already infected, as well as in the 3km culling zones, but said some would be removed in other areas.</p> <p>While Britain struggles to convince the world that the countryside is not off limits, the Irish tourist industry today launched a promotion to win back visitors from the UK in the face of a forecast \u00a3417m shortfall resulting from the crisis.</p> <p>The campaign coincided with similar moves by the holiday trade in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Newspaper advertisements will appear in Britain this weekend, assuring would-be visitors that Ireland is open for tourism business.</p> <p>The development was welcomed by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, but a spokesman said similar tourism campaigns would be required in the US and other parts of Europe to salvage the approaching holiday season.</p> <p>The Aer Lingus national airline has predicted that tourist numbers could be down by as much as 30% over the next three months, with advance bookings from the UK currently doing particularly badly. The ferries in Dublin said that they were experiencing a 35% drop in car and passenger services on services across the Irish sea.</p> <p>Back in England, a clay mound the size of a football pitch to be filled with 30,000 decomposing sheep and cattle has been suggested for the west country to solve a crisis of unburied animals.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture is so desperate about carcasses lying in fields and barns that it refuses any longer to publish the figures, and is considering the mound plan, put forward by the National Farmers' Union.</p> <p>\u0095 A slaughterman died in hospital last night after having been shot with a gun used to kill animals at a foot and mouth burial pit.

      "bodyText": "Government ministers were out in force today to promote British tourism in advance of the Easter holidays. The prime minister, Tony Blair, was in Yorkshire reassuring potential visitors that the foot and mouth outbreak would not interfere with their holiday plans. The government today pledged \u00a3120m of guaranteed loans to the tourist industry, after ministers confirmed yesterday that bookings are down 10% across the country and up to 80% in areas of Cumbria and Devon. The initiative targets those businesses hit by cash-flow problems by offering loans of between \u00a315,000 and \u00a3250,000. Many rural businesses such as B&amp;Bs are already eligible for loans under this scheme, but the move means that businesses such as garages, restaurants and souvenir shops can also now apply. In addition, the maximum time for repayment will be increased by a year to 11 years, and capital repayment breaks will be increased from two to three years. Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, went sailing on the Norfolk Broads today in an attempt to persuade tourists to return to the countryside. Mr Prescott was in Brundall, near Norwich, to meet officials from the Broads authority to discuss the problems facing the tourist industry in East Anglia. Many footpaths and mooring areas around the Broads are closed because of the disease, but Mr Prescott urged visitors to head to East Anglia this Easter, saying there was still lots of things to do. \"Even though some footpaths are closed there is still plenty to do and the countryside is still open,\" he said. The cabinet minister, Mo Mowlam, was visiting Warwick castle today to deliver a similar message. Cumbria county council was today removing road signs banning walkers from the countryside because the signs do not fit in with the \"open for business image\", the county council said. A committee concluded that the signs are \"absolutely necessary\" in the areas already infected, as well as in the 3km culling zones, but said some would be removed in other areas. While Britain struggles to convince the world that the countryside is not off limits, the Irish tourist industry today launched a promotion to win back visitors from the UK in the face of a forecast \u00a3417m shortfall resulting from the crisis. The campaign coincided with similar moves by the holiday trade in Britain and Northern Ireland. Newspaper advertisements will appear in Britain this weekend, assuring would-be visitors that Ireland is open for tourism business. The development was welcomed by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, but a spokesman said similar tourism campaigns would be required in the US and other parts of Europe to salvage the approaching holiday season. The Aer Lingus national airline has predicted that tourist numbers could be down by as much as 30% over the next three months, with advance bookings from the UK currently doing particularly badly. The ferries in Dublin said that they were experiencing a 35% drop in car and passenger services on services across the Irish sea. Back in England, a clay mound the size of a football pitch to be filled with 30,000 decomposing sheep and cattle has been suggested for the west country to solve a crisis of unburied animals. The Ministry of Agriculture is so desperate about carcasses lying in fields and barns that it refuses any longer to publish the figures, and is considering the mound plan, put forward by the National Farmers' Union. \u0095 A slaughterman died in hospital last night after having been shot with a gun used to kill animals at a foot and mouth burial pit. Steven Smart, 28, from St Leonards in East Sussex, was culling healthy sheep on Wednesday at Great Orton airfield in Cumbria when a three-inch retractable rod was fired into his head from a bolt gun used to kill livestock.He died at Newcastle general hospital at 5pm yesterday.

Angry Bosnian Croats responded by stoning international officials, beating up employees of international organisations and ransacking a local office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Nato spokesman lieutenant Lars Anderson said, \"there have been injuries\" among Nato-led peacekeepers but gave no further details. \"The situation is still developing,\" he added. As tension mounted, US and Nato forces bolstered their presence in a show of strength in areas with substantial Croat populations. International authorities ordered the takeover of the Mostar headquarters and several branches of the Hercegovacka Banka because of \"repeated concern over continued corruption\", a statement from chief international administrator Wolfgang Petritsch's office said. The bank is believed to be the financial base of the Bosnian wing of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which announced plans last month to break away from the Muslim-Croat Federation and establish a separate Croat state in south-western Bosnia. Today Nato, UN international police and security forces of the Muslim-Croat Federation raided the bank and named a provisional administration, Mr Petritsch's spokesman, Chris Bird, said. During the takeover, crowds stoned international officials and there were reports of shots fired outside the bank, UN spokesman Douglas Coffman said in Sarajevo. Several people who work for Mr Petritsch were beaten, and the office of the OSCE in Siroki Brijeg was ransacked, he said. \"By doing this raid, the international community has hit a raw nerve, targeting this institution which allegedly is linked to illegal parallel institutions,\" Mr Coffman said.

In Orasje, about 500 Bosnian Croats gathered in front of the Hercegovacka Banka branch to protest against the takeover. Tensions were already high in Orasje, located in northern Bosnia, because of efforts by hardliners and war veterans to convince Bosnian Croat soldiers to desert the federation army. American military helicopters hovered over Orasje and armoured personnel carriers patrolled the streets as mediators tried to reduce the tension. The raids took place a day after Bosnian Croat nationalists moved to take control of federation army barracks in the central Bosnian towns of Busovaca and Vitez. German peacekeepers also increased their presence today around another central Bosnian garrison at Kiseljak to prevent any moves against the base there. Bosnia-Herzegovina was divided into a Bosnian Serb mini-state and the Muslim-Croat Federation as part of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the three-year Bosnian war.

Records show the Hercegovacka Banka was founded in 1997 by several private companies and the Franciscan order, which controls the religious shrine in Medjugorje, a major source of income, both from pilgrims and from donations by Croats living abroad.

      "bodyText": "Scottish media group SMG has become the latest victim of the advertising drought affecting ITV companies. The owner of the Scottish Television and Grampian TV franchises said television revenues for the first three months of the year were down 9% compared to the same period in 2001. Donald Cruickshank, chairman of SMG, confirmed at the company's annual general meeting that a rapid recovery is unlikely, with analysts expecting the ITV advertising market to fall by up to 20% this month. \"While many commentators are predicting an upturn in the second half, a number of advertisers have been holding back on marketing budgets and only committing spend on a very short-term basis, thereby reducing our visibility on prospects over the coming months,\" he said. Advertising revenues at ITV rivals Granada and Carlton are expected to fall by 5% for their financial year to September. SMG has also been hit by the terms for its ITV licence renewals, which asked for an increased percentage of the group's advertising revenues. Mr Cruickshank warned shareholders that these factors would make the first six months of the year \"challenging.\" However, Mr Cruickshank added that revenues at SMG's Virgin Radio operation were holding up well. \"Radio is achieving revenues around the level of this time last year, which is a good result given current trading conditions and the falling away of dot.com advertising,\" he said. SMG's shares fell 7% to 187.5p on the news.",

      "bodyText": "When Pearson cut its losses with FTYourMoney, it effectively undid more than two years of work aimed at diversifying the FT's internet properties into a strong portfolio of brands. FTYourMoney was arguably the first in a long list of expensive websites to be hived off from the core FT.com product. During its year-long life span, FTYourMoney failed spectacularly to make any impact on the consumer personal finance market, despite a marketing budget of more than \u00a37m. What went wrong? Primarily, the website overstepped the confines of FT Group in that it took the company into the uneasy waters of the consumer market. It soon became clear that this wasn't a natural fit with the rest of the FT's properties and found it difficult to find a strong differentiating foothold in what quickly became a very crowded marketplace. But two years ago when the FT first called in the head-hunters to staff up for the generously paid executive positions at FTYourmoney, only a few within the industry questioned the FT's excursion into the consumer market. Most thought it would be a natural extension of predecessor FTQuicken, which was closed down to make way for FTYourmoney. After the initial 3m page impressions which followed a high-profile advertising campaign, traffic for FTYourmoney dropped off to insignificant levels. Curiously, just a day after it was announced that the site - now a shadow of its former self - would be integrated into FT.com, emails from staff at the Financial Times still displayed this obligatory advert at the bottom of the mail: \"For UK personal finance, please visit http://www.ftyourmoney.com\". Pearson, as expected, put a positive spin on Thursday's retrenchment. Of course, it did say back in August last year that it was now looking at an \"integration strategy\" and then last month it was reported to be halving investment in internet operations. \"It's not about what went wrong,\" said a spokesman from Pearson, \"It's about how different the market is from last year. The sensible thing is to combine resources in order to make stronger returns.\" The writing was on the wall, and staff working in the internet operations said there were very few surprises in the email memo from chief executive Stephen Hill was send round yesterday. Investment in FT.com is now expected to be scaled back to around \u00a350m this year as the company focuses heavily on premium subscription services, which are eventually expected to account for around half of all FT.com revenues. The 10% cut in the number of online staff was also expected, especially since the FT had staffed up so heavily and expensively last year. The only surprise, said one member of staff, was that there were editorial redundancies (around eight in total) because the FT always maintains it will try its hardest to protect editorial. The rest of the job cuts were felt in areas such as technology, marketing, and product management. Related stories Apr 6: FT cuts online jobs in quest to break even Read the FT memo",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has spent the day taking part in a series of set piece visits to tourist attractions and farmers in Yorkshire in an attempt to persuade the nation that the countryside is, after all, open for business. Wearing a suit and a light pink tie - in marked contrast to the protective clothing the prime minister wore on a visit to Cumbria a week earlier - Mr Blair and his wife Cherie began their day in York, where he toured the town's Viking centre. They were greeted by school children and a group of museum staff dressed in Roman costumes. \"The most important thing to get across to people is that Britain is open there is no problem with people coming over,\" he said. \"We have simply got to get across a proper sense of prospective.\" The trip came after a government announcement today of \u00a3120m of guaranteed loans to the tourist industry. Ministers confirmed yesterday that bookings are down 10% across the country and up to 80% in areas of Cumbria and Devon. Later Mr Blair and his wife visited the Bronte Parsonage in Howarth, West Yorkshire, the home of the famous literary family. Before entering the house Mrs Blair filled her husband in with details of the Bronte history, and agreed with waiting reporters that she was a fan of the writers. Mr and Mrs Blair were due to walk through the cobbled streets of the moorland village later before visiting a steam railway. Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, went sailing on the Norfolk Broads today in an attempt to persuade tourists to return to the countryside. However neither Mr Blair nor Mr Prescott would commit themselves to taking summer holiday in Britain. \"I do not yet know where I am going in the summer,\" said Mr Prescott, in Norfolk. \"Like anyone else it is about having a balance between going abroad and staying in Britain. MPs are no different to anybody else.\" The prime minister added that he would be delighted to visit the Yorkshire countryside for his holidays, if possible.

      "body": "<p>In fashion, there are a few standard phrases. Colours are always the New Black, and upcoming graduates are forever the New McQueen. So what do you call Miss Selfridge, the 35-year-old chain that's about to open a long-awaited new London flagship? Why, it's the New Topshop. </p> <p>Which is more apt than you'd think, since the new site, which opens on Monday, neighbours onto Topshop's mammoth Oxford Circus megastore. Indeed, the two are linked by an always-open door, which is no surprise since both brands are owned by the sector-leading Arcadia Group. By joining the two stores together, the company is showing its commitment to the teenage shopper, hinted at by the announcement yesterday that it plans to sell off some of its more dowdier chains, such as Principles, Racing Green and Hawkshead. </p> <p>But the differences between Topshop and Miss Selfridge could not be more stark - if you go to Topshop this weekend, head to the right hand side of the warehouse-style accessories floor and you can peek into Miss Selfridge's gaudy new palace, with its pink chandelier, loud grafitti walls and spinning, mirrored mosaic heart. The plan is for this new look to slowly influence the stores around the country. </p> <p>While Topshop is a trend factory, usually on the mark, sometimes wide of it, Miss Selfridge is smaller, more personal, more fun. Sally Bailey, the store's brand director, has wanted to move out of their old shop for years. \"For me, there are a lot of things people don't know about Miss Selfridge because we've never had a good flagship store,\" she says. \"We're not going posher, we're not going younger. We're saying, 'This is Miss Selfridge, this is what we stand for.'\" </p> <p>A few years ago, the old store, over the road from the new site, was up with the times. But as the Oxford Circus area slowly regenerated into what is now the most important retail district in the country, the shop, hidden away near Superdrug, started to look clumsy and tired. The need for a good flagship on this patch, now also inhabited by Niketown, Hennes, Gap, French Connection, Mango and Zara, cannot be overstated. Not only do millions of shoppers pass through the area each week hungry for quick-fix trends, but the pavements also act as a fashion barometer - it's well known that model scouts find most of their new faces by standing outside Oxford Circus tube, waiting for the New Kate Moss to walk up the steps. </p> <p>By moving a few feet across the road, Miss Selfridge goes from being that other store you might pop into after Topshop, and becomes a destination in itself. \"Moving there is great for us,\" says Bailey. \"We're the two biggest players on the market, so together we can only get stronger.\" Doesn't she worry that Topshop's formidable skill for spotting trends will dwarf its operation? \"We just do what's right for our customers, but it's like all competitive labels, no matter how expensive. You'll always find black trousers, you don't say we can't do it just because someone else is. We'll do a trend in our own way, but we'll take it further than anyone else on the high street.\" </p> <p>Which shows in its spring/summer collections - neon mesh vests, jersey T-shirts with Chloe-esque pineapples and blush pink ra-ra skirts will all be on the rails in its new store. It shows in its new edgy advertising campaign, where instead of the usual catalogue styling, the clothes look thrown on, as if they were cast in an edgy off-schedule show. One of the shots, with the models giggling in some teeny bikinis, has even been banned by London Underground for being too saucy. </p> <p>But the campaign also had other aims - to help break fashions obsession with gaunt, ill-looking waifs. \"When we chose the models, we didn't go for 'beautiful' ones,\" says Bailey, \"they're more like normal girls. There aren't any really thin girls, and none that are really young - they're all over 18, and they're putting two fingers up to the world.\" </p> <p>They need to be striking, because the other stores in the area are full of trends right now. Topshop has gone big on military, with a great take on Matthew Williamson's coloured camouflage and some very covetable neon belts (though these sit alongside some less desirable outfits - on one of the rails is a T-shirt with the slogan \"It's Friday Night and I'm Going To Get Hammered\"). Prada has influenced many of the shops - see the brilliant flower-shadow print skirt in black on white at Zara. </p> <p>At French Connection, once you've got past the big-selling but Frustratingly Unfunny Comedy Klothing, there are some pretty candy colours, while Uth has some great Grecian billowing tops, and its rival Jigsaw has scored high with its Marc Jacobs-like 50s bad girl look. Amid all these key styles, it's easy to see why stores such as Gap are floundering. None of the shades is right for this season - dull oranges, blues and yellows without any hints of neon, and no thought has been put into the cut or shape of the clothes. \"Blouson\" and \"assymetric\" are clearly not part of its vocabulary. </p> <p>Indeed, Bailey says that, although the high street is crowded, the wheat is starting to emerge from the chaff. \"More people are leaving the market than coming into it. There are not that many getting it right for 15-24 year olds.\" And Arcadia's business-shedding strategy is proof that its core business are the late-teen, early 20s shoppers. For them, the restatement of the Miss Selfridge brand could not have come at a better time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Israel launched a rocket attack on two Palestinian police stations today and knocked out power to thousands of homes after four Israeli communities were attacked by Palestinian mortar fire. Meanwhile, a leading Islamic militant killed in an explosion attributed to Israeli forces was buried in the town of Jenin in the West Bank. Eight men in white robes, meant to symbolise the death shrouds of suicide bombers, carried the flag-draped body of Iyad Hardan through the streets, followed by some 5,000 mourners. Mr Hardan was killed yesterday when a public phone he used exploded and a thirst for revenge dominated the mood at his funeral today. He was a follower of the Islamic Jihad group, which has carried out a series of attacks in Israel in recent months. Two other suspected Islamic militants held in the Jenin jail were released after his death, it has been reported. The Israeli rocket attacks on northern Gaza early today came in response to mortar fire on three Jewish settlements and an Israeli communal farm on the border with the Gaza Strip. No one was hurt by the mortar shells. In the past, Israel had only launched air strikes if Israelis were killed or wounded in Palestinian attacks. The rockets knocked out large parts of the facade of a two-story building in a residential neighbourhood of the town of Beit Lahiya. Palestinian police had moved out of the area when they heard the gunships approaching, although two bystanders were hit by shrapnel. In several West Bank towns, including Hebron and Ramallah, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers. In Ramallah, troops fired rubber-coated bullets and tear gas, injuring 19 Palestinians, according to paramedics at the scene. Israeli officials, meanwhile, said they would step up retaliation for Palestinian shootings, bombings and mortar attacks. Israel will strike back \"relentlessly\" and Palestinian security installations will be considered targets as long as security forces fail to prevent attacks on Israelis, said Raanan Gissin, a top aide to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. The internal security minister, Uzi Landau, said Israeli forces should hit Palestinian targets \"every day, hour after hour\".

      "bodyText": "A stout-drinking squirrel and a giant curtain that reveals the meaning of life are the bizarre ingredients of the long-awaited follow-up to the Guinness \"Surfer\" commercial. Surfer, in which a fanatical surfer crashes towards the shore on waves of white horses, was voted the best TV advert of all time in a national survey by the Sunday Times and Channel 4 last year. The new commercial, entitled \"Dream Club\", reunites the team behind Surfer and forms part of a \u00a35m campaign that breaks this weekend. Following in the surreal tradition of Surfer, the new advert focuses on the members of a fictional elite club of adventurers who aim to find the meaning of life through their dreams. Shot in the brewer's trademark black and white, the film shows a member of the group finally achieving his aim, fuelled, of course, by a pint of Guinness. The commercial ends with the campaign line, \"Good things come to those who wait\". Dream Club was created by Guinness's advertising agency Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO and directed by Jonathan Glazer. The advert was shot in sub-zero temperatures in Budapest using 50 stuntmen and some 500 extras as well as a cast of local actors. \"We are confident that our advertising agency AMV and Jonathan Glazer have come up with the goods again,\" said Guinness marketing manager Wendy Darlington. \"We expect Dream Club to be one of our most successful campaigns to date.\" The campaign is aimed at driving up sales among 18 to 35-year-old men and the commercial will premiere during Sky's coverage of the England v France rugby on Saturday.",

      "body": "<p>US diplomats in China said this afternoon that a planned meeting with the crew of a downed American spy plane has taken place after a lengthy delay, and another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.</p> <p>The meeting with the 24 crew members, who have been held by Chinese authorities since making an emergency landing on Hainan island in the South China sea on Sunday, had been scheduled to take place at 4pm local time (8am GMT) today.</p> <p>But the US embassy in Beijing was forced to retract an earlier report that the meeting had begun. Diplomats who had been scheduled to meet with the air crew at 4pm were kept waiting for nearly four hours.</p> <p>Brigadier General Neal Sealock, the American military attache in China, said the crew members were in good spirits and had received the toiletries, books and other supplies that earlier had been turned over to Chinese officials.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities today granted this second visit to the crew following a statement of regret from US president, George Bush, for the probable death of a Chinese pilot in the incident.</p> <p>Beijing is still demanding a full apology for the collision between the US navy EP-3E surveillance plane and one of the two Chinese jets that were tailing it. The Chinese pilot has been missing in the South China sea since he parachuted from his plane after the collision.</p> <p>In high level talks, the United States has been seeking the release of the crew and their aircraft. In their only meeting with the crew so far - on Tuesday in Hainan's capital, Haikou - US diplomats said the Americans appeared in good health and high spirits. Today's meeting was also expected to take place in Haikou.</p> <p>In Washington the deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, met with Chinese ambassador Yang Jiechi. In Beijing the US ambassador to China, Joseph Prueher, met twice with assistant foreign minister Zhou Wenzhong.</p> <p>\"We're engaged with the Chinese at the appropriate levels, and we're working very hard.

      "bodyText": "US diplomats in China said this afternoon that a planned meeting with the crew of a downed American spy plane has taken place after a lengthy delay, and another meeting is scheduled for tomorrow. The meeting with the 24 crew members, who have been held by Chinese authorities since making an emergency landing on Hainan island in the South China sea on Sunday, had been scheduled to take place at 4pm local time (8am GMT) today. But the US embassy in Beijing was forced to retract an earlier report that the meeting had begun. Diplomats who had been scheduled to meet with the air crew at 4pm were kept waiting for nearly four hours. Brigadier General Neal Sealock, the American military attache in China, said the crew members were in good spirits and had received the toiletries, books and other supplies that earlier had been turned over to Chinese officials. The Chinese authorities today granted this second visit to the crew following a statement of regret from US president, George Bush, for the probable death of a Chinese pilot in the incident. Beijing is still demanding a full apology for the collision between the US navy EP-3E surveillance plane and one of the two Chinese jets that were tailing it. The Chinese pilot has been missing in the South China sea since he parachuted from his plane after the collision. In high level talks, the United States has been seeking the release of the crew and their aircraft. In their only meeting with the crew so far - on Tuesday in Hainan's capital, Haikou - US diplomats said the Americans appeared in good health and high spirits. Today's meeting was also expected to take place in Haikou. In Washington the deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, met with Chinese ambassador Yang Jiechi. In Beijing the US ambassador to China, Joseph Prueher, met twice with assistant foreign minister Zhou Wenzhong. \"We're engaged with the Chinese at the appropriate levels, and we're working very hard. We're in intensive discussions, and we're all committed to trying to solve this,\" Mr Prueher said today. Despite the positive development, China still blames the US plane for the collision, which occurred about 60 miles south of Hainan. China has welcomed US expressions of regret as a first step, but the US has refused China's demand for a formal apology, suggesting that the Chinese plane is to blame for the collision.

She urged the speedy adoption of a legally-binding directive on workers information and consultation, which is backed by the TUC, but opposed by Tony Blair and the CBI.</p> <p>\"It is unworthy of Europe that employers have to learn about their redundancy through the press or only few minutes before a public announcement,\" the Greek commissioner protested. \"We cannot remain silent in the face of such decisions and their effect on employees and their families.\"</p> <p>Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Germany all oppose the directive, which was proposed by the commission in 1998 to harmonise rules for consultation procedures between management and employers. But under EU rules the matter has to be decided by qualified majority voting (QMV) and if there is a change of position by Germany it could go through in June, shortly after Britain's expected general election.</p> <p>If the directive was already in force it would have prevented cases like those of General Motors' Luton plant, where the media were first with news of 2,000 job losses, or Corus in South Wales in February, where management secrecy enraged British ministers. The CBI is vehemently opposed to the directive, which it says would make British business less competitive. The directive would apply to any firm with more than 50 employees.</p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, has rejected \"flawed\" EU proposals as not appropriate for Britain on the grounds that corporate structures are different in the UK from on the continent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain came under fresh pressure from the European commission to sign up to compulsory management-employee consultation yesterday following mass redundancies at branches of Marks and Spencers across Europe and other big job losses in France. Anna Diamantopoulou, the commissioner for employment and social affairs, said she could not \"remain silent\" following the loss in the space of one week of a total of 6,000 jobs at M&amp;S and the French-based food manufacturer, Danone. She urged the speedy adoption of a legally-binding directive on workers information and consultation, which is backed by the TUC, but opposed by Tony Blair and the CBI. \"It is unworthy of Europe that employers have to learn about their redundancy through the press or only few minutes before a public announcement,\" the Greek commissioner protested. \"We cannot remain silent in the face of such decisions and their effect on employees and their families.\" Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Germany all oppose the directive, which was proposed by the commission in 1998 to harmonise rules for consultation procedures between management and employers. But under EU rules the matter has to be decided by qualified majority voting (QMV) and if there is a change of position by Germany it could go through in June, shortly after Britain's expected general election. If the directive was already in force it would have prevented cases like those of General Motors' Luton plant, where the media were first with news of 2,000 job losses, or Corus in South Wales in February, where management secrecy enraged British ministers. The CBI is vehemently opposed to the directive, which it says would make British business less competitive. The directive would apply to any firm with more than 50 employees. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, has rejected \"flawed\" EU proposals as not appropriate for Britain on the grounds that corporate structures are different in the UK from on the continent.",

      "body": "<p>Financial Times Group Announcement 5th April 2001 </p> <p>Dear colleagues,</p> <p>FT.com: Next Steps to Profitability - an update</p> <p>Over the last year, we have made a lot of progress transforming FT.com into the essential online tool for the international business executive. FT.com now attracts some 2 million unique monthly users - up over 50% on this time last year. But we don't just want to be the biggest online international business portal; we want to be one of the most profitable, too. We will break even by the end of next year and generate significant returns thereafter. This path to profitability involves us taking three steps of broadly equal significance:</p> <p>Moving from start up to operational mode.<br>Last year, we had some hefty one-off start up costs - primarily in marketing FT.com in the UK and US and building our technology infrastructure. The marketing campaigns enabled us to make the big breakthrough in traffic growth that we recorded. Our focus is now to ensure we retain these customers and to sell them premium services and other FT Group products. This means we can focus our marketing efforts more tightly and will spend less. And, with the technology we now have in place, we can scale up our online operations - and develop new services - at little incremental cost. So, in this and future years, our marketing and technology costs will be much lower.</p> <p>Integrating our operations. <br>Since August last year we have been carefully integrating our internet editorial and advertisement sales operations with those of the newspaper. And we have seen how we have become more efficient by doing so. The current economic climate has highlighted the need to continue to drive this process forward. Today we are announcing the next stage, integrating and restructuring our technology, marketing, product management and other operations. Unfortunately, as a result, we expect to lose around 40 positions across the FT Internet businesses. We have tried very hard to keep this number to a minimum. Over the next month we will be consulting as to how this can be best achieved. Of course we will also be doing all we can to help those of our colleagues affected by these changes to find new roles within Pearson or outside the company.</p> <p>Growing revenues. <br>Last year, FT.com revenues increased threefold to \u00a318 million and we are on track to achieve very strong revenue growth again this year. Although the economic climate is difficult, our online advertising revenues continue to increase. At the same time, we are generating new sources of revenues from licensing FT.com content and developing a range of new premium and subscription services (such as FT Mobile, Ask FT and FT Careerpoint). Next year, as the full benefit of these premium services start to kick in, we expect only around half our online revenues to be advertising driven.</p> <p>Some four years ago we launched the most significant investment that the FT newspaper had ever had, to grow our international circulation. Today, we are seeing the return on that investment, not just in record copy sales and profitability but also in the enhanced reputation of the FT throughout the international business world. Likewise, we are confident that the investment we are making today in the digital expansion of the FT will bring similar rewards. </p> <p>Michael Murphy and Olivier Fleurot will be presenting the FT newspaper/FT.com strategy to everyone at OSB on April 10th, but if you have any further questions or comments in the meantime, please contact myself or Michael Murphy.</p> <p>Stephen Hill<br> Chief Executive<br> FT Group</p>",

Arsenal failed to convince Mr Justice Laddie that a trader selling scarves and shirts bearing the club's names and logos constituted an infringement of the Arsenal trademark. But the battle between the north London club and street trader Matthew Reed will go to extra time in the European court of justice after the judge said UK law was too \"unsettled\" to decide the issue. The judge also threw out the club's allegation that Mr Reed was passing off his products as genuine Arsenal merchandise. But Arsenal was given a last-minute reprieve when the judge queried Mr Reed's argument that the Arsenal logos were \"badges of allegiance\" and not an infringement of trademarks. Mr Justice Laddie said the issue would have to be decided by the European court of justice because of the \"current unsettled state of the law.\" A further hearing on May 1 will decide whether the case goes to the court of appeal or straight to Europe. If the case finally goes against Arsenal, it could cut premiership clubs off from a vital revenue stream which is becoming a bigger money-spinner than gate receipts.

The question of who confronted Phil Mitchell on the steps of his house and left him for dead has been keeping EastEnders fans, bookies and the soap's cast on tenterhooks for five weeks. Was it that multi-personality Mark Fowler, who after years of being nice was driven to attempted murder; was it dirty Dan; wimpish Ian; suave night-club owner Steve; or spurned girlfriend Lisa Shaw. It wasn't quite the soap cliffhanger of summer 1980 when the whole of America, Britain and Ireland were left hanging in suspense. For eight months viewers wondered whether it was half-mad quivering lip Sue-Ellen or her sister and mistress Kirsten who had shot evil oil tycoon JR. But judging by the early ratings for last night's episode revealing Lisa as the culprit, it came pretty damn close. By the time video-recording and Sunday night's omnibus edition are taken into account the ratings for Who Shot Phil? are expected to top 24m. When Dallas returned in November 1980 to reveal Kirsten as JR's assailant show, 21m viewers watched. These, were however, pre-video days. It means last night's episode will probably be the highest-watched programme of the year and one of EastEnders' all-time favourite episodes - with millions more viewers than other cliffhanger episodes such as Tiffany's death - 13.5m; Bianca giving birth in the Vic - 22.1m; or Grant Mitchell's disappearance into the Thames - 15m. Indeed it looks like becoming the most watched instalment of the soap since the last time Phil was in a hospital intensive care unit bed more than six years ago. Back in October 1994, 25.3m turned in to see Phil ending up in surgery when little brother Grant found out about his affair with wife Sharon. As soap history goes Who Shot Phil? still can't compare with the nation's all-time favourite soap moment - Christmas 1986 when 30.1m tuned in to see Dirty Den serve divorce papers on Angie.

The ruling Liberal Democrat party (LDP) is planning to hold a leadership election on April 24 to choose a successor.</p> <p>However, his resignation is unlikely to solve Japan's mounting problems. A long-awaited recovery from the lengthy economic downturn has stalled and banks are still crippled by a decade-long debt crisis.</p> <p>\"I made up my mind to resign because I think it is necessary to tackle mounting issues both at home and abroad under a new administration,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying by the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda.</p> <p>There is general agreement in Japan that Mr Mori leaves the country hungering for leadership, and that his mistakes have severely damaged the LDP, which has ruled nearly uninterrupted since 1955.</p> <p>\"Japan needs economic reforms no matter who the prime minister is,\" said Masumi Ishikawa, a political expert at Obirin university in Tokyo. \"The year 2001 will be the year that made it clear that the LDP is finally falling apart.\"</p> <p>The cabinet today announced an emergency economic package that set a two-year deadline for banks to dispose of their riskiest bad loans. One estimate has the level of debt at \u00a373.5bn.</p> <p>The apparent front runner to replace Mr Mori is the former prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who served from 1996 to 1998. Mr Hashimoto heads the LDP's largest faction and reportedly has the support of two other factions.</p> <p>Mr Hashimoto said today that he was flattered by the attention, but stopped short of declaring his candidacy.</p> <p>Another politician often mentioned as a possible candidate, reform-minded Junichiro Koizumi, gave his strongest indication yet that he intends to seek the prime minister's post.</p> <p>\"You have to fight when you have to fight,\" said Mr Koizumi. \"It would be cowardly to avoid the contest out of a fear of losing.\"</p> <p>The former health minister is popular with the public, but analysts see his chances as slim because he has provoked distrust within the party with his calls to privatise the postal service.</p> <p>Mr Mori took office in April 2000 after the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a fatal stroke. His selection in a closed-door meeting of LDP bigwigs immediately came under heavy criticism and he was widely assailed as a policy lightweight.</p> <p>He has also been attacked for comments recalling Japan's wartime emperor worship and militarism, and for his decision to continue a round of golf in February after being told of the collision of a US submarine and a fishing vessel, in which nine Japanese were killed.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,463788,00.html\">27.03.2001: The down turn</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,451227,00.html\">13.03.2001: Japanese PM calls early party elections</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/japan/story/0,7369,450819,00.html\">13.03.2001: Mori?

      "bodyText": "Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, told his cabinet today that he would stand down after just a year in office, signalling the end of one of the country's most unpopular governments since the end of the second world war. Mr Mori, under fire for months over verbal gaffes and mistakes, had been long expected to quit. The ruling Liberal Democrat party (LDP) is planning to hold a leadership election on April 24 to choose a successor. However, his resignation is unlikely to solve Japan's mounting problems. A long-awaited recovery from the lengthy economic downturn has stalled and banks are still crippled by a decade-long debt crisis. \"I made up my mind to resign because I think it is necessary to tackle mounting issues both at home and abroad under a new administration,\" Mr Mori was quoted as saying by the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda. There is general agreement in Japan that Mr Mori leaves the country hungering for leadership, and that his mistakes have severely damaged the LDP, which has ruled nearly uninterrupted since 1955. \"Japan needs economic reforms no matter who the prime minister is,\" said Masumi Ishikawa, a political expert at Obirin university in Tokyo. \"The year 2001 will be the year that made it clear that the LDP is finally falling apart.\" The cabinet today announced an emergency economic package that set a two-year deadline for banks to dispose of their riskiest bad loans. One estimate has the level of debt at \u00a373.5bn. The apparent front runner to replace Mr Mori is the former prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who served from 1996 to 1998. Mr Hashimoto heads the LDP's largest faction and reportedly has the support of two other factions. Mr Hashimoto said today that he was flattered by the attention, but stopped short of declaring his candidacy. Another politician often mentioned as a possible candidate, reform-minded Junichiro Koizumi, gave his strongest indication yet that he intends to seek the prime minister's post. \"You have to fight when you have to fight,\" said Mr Koizumi. \"It would be cowardly to avoid the contest out of a fear of losing.\" The former health minister is popular with the public, but analysts see his chances as slim because he has provoked distrust within the party with his calls to privatise the postal service. Mr Mori took office in April 2000 after the prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, suffered a fatal stroke. His selection in a closed-door meeting of LDP bigwigs immediately came under heavy criticism and he was widely assailed as a policy lightweight. He has also been attacked for comments recalling Japan's wartime emperor worship and militarism, and for his decision to continue a round of golf in February after being told of the collision of a US submarine and a fishing vessel, in which nine Japanese were killed.

      "bodyText": "The government's long-awaited plans to reform the regulation of nursing, published this week, are likely to have reverberations well beyond the profession. The move is part of a wider strategy, precipitated by a catalogue of recent medical scandals, to clip the wings of the professionals and give the public and politicians a bigger say in how they are governed. The process began this week with the nurses and the professions allied to medicine. Under the new plans - which follow a three-month consultation period with the profession - a new regulatory body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), will take over from the UK Central Council for Nursing, Midwifey and Health Visiting (UKCC), which has governed nurses for the past 22 years. The new council, which will operate from next year, will be smaller than its predecessor and - more controversially - will have nearly as many lay members as professionals. It will also have the power to impose a wider range of sanctions on erring nurses and to ensure decisions are reached more quickly and effectively. Above all, the new proposals will make nurses more accountable to patients and the wider public. For the first time the NMC's primary function to protect the public will be enshrined in legislation. There will be a range of measures to encourage the public as well as the profession to make this a reality. Claire Perry, who is heading the change management group overseeing the transition process, believes the changes should help employers by making training more relevant to service needs. In addition, extra powers to check on a new recruit's health and character as well as professional aptitude should help root out rogue nurses. \"I'm not sure you will ever be able to stop a Shipman or Beverly Allitt, who were utterly determined to kill patients, but this should make a big difference with the more common examples of misconduct,\" she said. The new plans will also seek to close one of the most worrying loopholes in the monitoring process - the failure of many health trusts to check on nurses' backgrounds before taking them on in the first place. Employers are supposed to check with the UKCC to ensure a new nurse recruit is bona fide, but many simply rely on the nurse's pin card, which is little more than a receipt. \"The pin card is not intended to be used as a proof of registration,\" explained a spokesman for the new body. \"The only 100% effective way of checking on someone's credentials is to use our confirmation service.\" The service is free, easily accessible and should only take a few minutes, but unfortunately many employers - especially in the NHS - skip this process and the consequences can be disastrous. \"The spectrum of risk is everything from someone claiming qualifications they don't have to the nightmare scenario of a convicted paedophile slipping through the net and being allowed to work on a children's ward,\" said the spokesman. The other related concern for many employers is the position of the estimated 100,000 nursing and health care assistants working in the NHS and private nursing homes. This group is currently unregulated despite the fact that the public are arguably more open to abuse from them than from registered nurses since they provide much of the hands-on care. This means a nurse who is struck off the register could, theoretically, return to work as a care assistant without facing any scrutiny. Ministers are considering setting up a care assistants' regulatory body - possibly under the auspices of the NMC.

The latest results say little about the standing of the two major parties but much about morale with Labour throwing in the towel in half the polls including one seat at Cirencester Watermoor, Cotswold District, Gloucestershire which the party had previously held. Surprisingly, it also failed to fight at Hawkinge and Paddlesworth, Shepway District, Kent which is in the Folkestone and Hythe constituency of the Tory former home secretary Michael Howard. He comfortably held off a Liberal Democrat challenge in the 1997 general election mainly because Labour strongly boosted its vote in third place. But the latest result - a Liberal Democrat win from nowhere - following two gains from Labour in Shepway in January suggests Mr Howard could be at risk this time from tactical voting. Liberal Democrats, as well as taking the Cotswold seat, also stormed Labour's Atherton stronghold in Wigan Borough, Greater Manchester. There was better news for a Labour at Regent's Park, Westminster - the only comparable ward where the main fight was between it and Tories - with a 5% swing since 1998.

      "trailText": "<p>Who Shot Phil Mitchell? |  EastEnders</p>",
      "byline": "Nancy Banks-Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.\" </p> <p> - Cole Porter </p> <p>Dave Courtney was a gangster. He is a bald bloke with a lively line in jackets and patter. Unlike the other punters invited to back their fancy in <strong> Who Shot Phil Mitchell?</strong> (BBC1, Saturday), Dave had been there. He said, \"There is nothing quite as scary as your missus with the 'ump.\" Wrenching your attention away from the thought of Mrs Courtney with a noise like velcro, you can only say, \"Well done, my son!\" </p> <p>As almost everyone in EastEnders could hide at will behind a spiral staircase, almost anyone could have shot Phil. However, the main contenders were Mark, an honest barrow boy (no, really), Dan, who gets stuck in doorways, Ian, a busted flush, Steve, who is smoother than snakeskin shorts, and Lisa, a spurned woman. But as Dave suspected, it was Lisa, who took a gun and shot her lover down. </p> <p>She is pregnant, and you consider with horror the frightful future fruit of Lisa's womb and Phil's loins. It will not, you suspect, be the nicer kind of child. </p> <p><strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC 1) played this one so close to their chest, their nipples were not in the know. Various versions were filmed on closed sets with skeleton crews and strict security. False scripts were written which disturbed the tabloids' radar like metallic chaff. Editors' better nature was appealed to (good luck on that one). They managed to keep the secret while milking the story vigorously for its publicity; even the kick-off for the Barcelona v Liverpool football match was delayed to accommodate the programme. </p> <p>The thunderous summons on every suspect's door at the end of Tuesday's EastEnders implied they were all due for a visit but, in fact, Phil went, like a missus-seeking missile, straight for Lisa. It was a strained encounter. \"Woz ma'er, Lise? You don't seem pleased to see me.\" Lisa quickly offered him a cup of tea, which he declined like a vicar who has had an ample sufficiency of Lapsang Souchong. He was, for Phil, disturbingly affable. You wouldn't like him when he is affable. He had, he indicated, come to finger the guilty party as the Bill were baffled. \"I have one teeny weeny advantage over them ... I know who did it ... I saw 'em.\" </p> <p>\"Oo?\" asked Lisa. </p> <p>\"You!\" said Phil. </p> <p>This was an extraordinarily direct exchange for Albert Square, where a question is always answered with another question, presumably on the grounds that any information might incriminate the speaker. As in \"Knock! Knock!\" \"Who's there?\" \"Who's arsking?\" \"Who's arsking who's arsking?\" </p> <p>EastEnders has a speciality it keeps for special occasions. In a double-header episode, two faces fill the screen as if they existed in their own soap bubble. It often has unusual intensity and intimacy. Phil (Steve McFadden) and Lisa (Lucy Benjamin) conducted something between a duet and a duel until two other suspects, Mark and Ian, arrived. Ian is the EastEnder most likely to burst into tears. He could give Lord Lundy lessons. Ian had seen Phil dying on the pavement. \"I found him. I saw the blood. He was hardly breathing. I waited a minute and then I left. I panicked. You'd have done the same. Anyone would.\" </p> <p>Dave, the ex-gangster, had a prescient comment on Ian. \"He's pathetic ... I'd be embarrassed to live next door to him.\" </p> <p>That left only two of the original suspects, Steve and Dan. Though they were innocent of the shooting, they have been blocking Phil's sunlight.

      "bodyText": "\"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.\" - Cole Porter Dave Courtney was a gangster. He is a bald bloke with a lively line in jackets and patter. Unlike the other punters invited to back their fancy in Who Shot Phil Mitchell? (BBC1, Saturday), Dave had been there. He said, \"There is nothing quite as scary as your missus with the 'ump.\" Wrenching your attention away from the thought of Mrs Courtney with a noise like velcro, you can only say, \"Well done, my son!\" As almost everyone in EastEnders could hide at will behind a spiral staircase, almost anyone could have shot Phil. However, the main contenders were Mark, an honest barrow boy (no, really), Dan, who gets stuck in doorways, Ian, a busted flush, Steve, who is smoother than snakeskin shorts, and Lisa, a spurned woman. But as Dave suspected, it was Lisa, who took a gun and shot her lover down. She is pregnant, and you consider with horror the frightful future fruit of Lisa's womb and Phil's loins. It will not, you suspect, be the nicer kind of child. EastEnders (BBC 1) played this one so close to their chest, their nipples were not in the know. Various versions were filmed on closed sets with skeleton crews and strict security. False scripts were written which disturbed the tabloids' radar like metallic chaff. Editors' better nature was appealed to (good luck on that one). They managed to keep the secret while milking the story vigorously for its publicity; even the kick-off for the Barcelona v Liverpool football match was delayed to accommodate the programme. The thunderous summons on every suspect's door at the end of Tuesday's EastEnders implied they were all due for a visit but, in fact, Phil went, like a missus-seeking missile, straight for Lisa. It was a strained encounter. \"Woz ma'er, Lise? You don't seem pleased to see me.\" Lisa quickly offered him a cup of tea, which he declined like a vicar who has had an ample sufficiency of Lapsang Souchong. He was, for Phil, disturbingly affable. You wouldn't like him when he is affable. He had, he indicated, come to finger the guilty party as the Bill were baffled. \"I have one teeny weeny advantage over them ... I know who did it ... I saw 'em.\" \"Oo?\" asked Lisa. \"You!\" said Phil. This was an extraordinarily direct exchange for Albert Square, where a question is always answered with another question, presumably on the grounds that any information might incriminate the speaker. As in \"Knock! Knock!\" \"Who's there?\" \"Who's arsking?\" \"Who's arsking who's arsking?\" EastEnders has a speciality it keeps for special occasions. In a double-header episode, two faces fill the screen as if they existed in their own soap bubble. It often has unusual intensity and intimacy. Phil (Steve McFadden) and Lisa (Lucy Benjamin) conducted something between a duet and a duel until two other suspects, Mark and Ian, arrived. Ian is the EastEnder most likely to burst into tears. He could give Lord Lundy lessons. Ian had seen Phil dying on the pavement. \"I found him. I saw the blood. He was hardly breathing. I waited a minute and then I left. I panicked. You'd have done the same. Anyone would.\" Dave, the ex-gangster, had a prescient comment on Ian. \"He's pathetic ... I'd be embarrassed to live next door to him.\" That left only two of the original suspects, Steve and Dan. Though they were innocent of the shooting, they have been blocking Phil's sunlight. Particularly, perhaps, Dan. When the room suddenly goes dark, you know it's Dan trying to get through the door again. Phil clutched the slight figure of his nephew, Jamie, and said, \"From now on, we don't need anyone. We're gonna get rid of Steve. We're gonna get rid of Dan. From now on it's just you and me.\" The Mitchells mutate in a very strange way. Phil used to be a nice young man, who tidied up after Grant like a street cleaner when the Household Cavalry have passed, but, the moment Grant went, Phil mutated into his brother. Jamie, a pretty lad clearly intended by nature to play Peaseblossom, has recently taken to scowling horribly in the hope of unnerving someone.

Media reporting of this tragic incident in Bow has focused on the response by the police and emergency services. Following the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, police actions have especially fallen under the spotlight. But what about housing? A picture is emerging of an estate where Bangladeshi families are victims of severe harassment from young people. One local estate agent said the shops below Mr Rahman's flat are no-go areas for Asians. \"We were just waiting for something like this to happen,\" he said. Some of Mr Rahman's neighbours have argued that things are so bad that they are too scared to go outside - and they are desperate to leave the area. While no evidence has yet emerged of recent racists attacks before the murder, it seems that local Asian families have been the victims of persistent racist abuse.Their experiences are all too common for members of ethnic communities. This makes the call by the independent race and housing inquiry for a revolution in race equality in housing all the more urgent. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry rightly pointed out that housing providers can do more to tackle racial harassment. \"All too often housing departments were seen to be slow and bureaucratic in their response to racist behaviour,\" the report says. It calls for housing organisations to work together with other local agencies and tenants to address racism and promote cultural diversity in their area. It recommends setting up reporting centres to enable residents to report racist incidents, and that ethnic groups should be engaged in improving services for everyone.

      "body": "<p><strong> Joe Locke</strong> Storytelling <br>(Sirocco Jazz) *** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p> There's a good deal of Gary Burton's lyricism and subtlety of touch in the work of the younger American vibraphonist Joe Locke, who played in the UK last year with Tim Garland's American/British ensemble and who opens at Ronnie Scott's on Monday with his own band including Garland. It's likely that Locke's week-long residency will include much of the material from this CD, since vocalist Mark Ledford is there too. </p> <p>The Gary Burton sound is in Locke's rich chords as much as in the dance of his single-line playing - but though Locke is a player who often keeps adventurous postbop company, both his approach and the dominant atmosphere of this session are surprisingly traditional. The set is aimed as much at a smooth-jazz audience and fans of such elegant contemporary/retro vocalists as Carmen Lundy as it is at the jazz hardcore. Mark Ledford, a staple feature of the Pat Metheny touring band for years and a fine vocal technician, is adept at a very superior Las Vegas singing style, and it's a sound that governs the impact of the set. Ledford's light, flexible voice curls around classics like The Thrill Is Gone (given a gentle funk groove) and Blame It on My Youth, and Locke reflects that easy-going lyricism in his sensitive interplay. Ledford's singing will be gracefully romantic to some and perhaps just plain cheesy to others. Despite the presence of Garland, Hammondist Henry Hey and drummer Jeff \"Tain\" Watts, this set doesn't quite ignite the way its elements suggest that it should. </p> <p><strong> Zoe Rahman</strong> The Cynic<br> (Manushi Records, <a href=\"http://www.zoerahman.com\">www.zoerahman.com</a>) ****<br> </p> <p> British pianist Zoe Rahman won the Perrier Young Jazz Musician of the Year award a couple of years ago, and has continued to evolve her vivacious, technically robust and expressive straightahead style. She toured on her own and with the David-Jean Baptiste band that included the formidable James Carter last year, revealing that she was both a powerful solo voice and a confidently creative group player. This self-marketed CD is Rahman's debut disc, featuring her regular trio with Jeremy Brown on bass and Winston Clifford on drums. All the pieces and the arrangements are Rahman originals, and the sustained quality of the writing suggests Rahman's career may well mature in more ways than at the keyboard alone. The uptempo feature Apple Pie, with its stalking, McCoy Tyner-like theme, is an emphatic, compelling piece that Rahman could well find quite a few of her contemporaries borrowing. The pianist's dewy, rippling-arpeggio delicacy with ballads is beautifully realised on the classical-sounding slow feature Monica. Meanwhile, the headlong title track has a quicksilver unpredictability of line that suggests Paul Bley, and Rahman's mingling of tumbling runs with ruggedly percussive chording and an alert rhythmic sense (shadowed everywhere by Clifford's restless percussion) suggests a musical mind as deft as her fingers. </p> <p><strong> New York Connexion</strong> Crossing the Bridge<br> (Sirocco Jazz) ** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p> It is a pity that this collection of pieces - by a New York ensemble including three members of the superb Dave Holland band that visited the UK recently - should begin with saxophonist Antonio Hart's rather diffuse, dolorous tone-poem Nine Weeks. It sets a tone for the music that isn't quite a fair reflection of its improvisors' strengths. But when you learn that the principal musical direction comes from a trombonist, the excellent Robin Eubanks, some questions about the prevailing mood of plush, slow-moving cloud-formations of chords and a lot of patiently interweaving counter-melody seem to get answered. The group doesn't have the nervous urgency of Dave Holland's band, despite their shared core of the extraordinary Billy Kilson's drumming. This is the second New York Connexion recording, with two pieces imported from other writers, while the rest have been generated by band-members. There is plenty of fine soloing from Antonio Hart (a once rather formulaic postbopper who is becoming increasingly quirky). Good work, too, from the jubilant swing and mellow, rounded sound of vibraharpist Joe Locke, the Herbie Hancockish harmonies of pianist Michael Cain, and the airily original Eubanks. Cain's contribution to Claire Fischer's Latin shuffler Morning is a good example of how to avoid the usual licks in the Lat-Am jazz idiom - it starts with a strange, inquisitive figure and drapes deceptively relaxed lines over it, but always returns to a slightly anxious insistence. But for a session populated by such pedigree sidemen, the overall impact is surprisingly becalmed.</p>",

New York Connexion Crossing the Bridge (Sirocco Jazz) ** \u00a315.99 It is a pity that this collection of pieces - by a New York ensemble including three members of the superb Dave Holland band that visited the UK recently - should begin with saxophonist Antonio Hart's rather diffuse, dolorous tone-poem Nine Weeks. It sets a tone for the music that isn't quite a fair reflection of its improvisors' strengths. But when you learn that the principal musical direction comes from a trombonist, the excellent Robin Eubanks, some questions about the prevailing mood of plush, slow-moving cloud-formations of chords and a lot of patiently interweaving counter-melody seem to get answered. The group doesn't have the nervous urgency of Dave Holland's band, despite their shared core of the extraordinary Billy Kilson's drumming. This is the second New York Connexion recording, with two pieces imported from other writers, while the rest have been generated by band-members. There is plenty of fine soloing from Antonio Hart (a once rather formulaic postbopper who is becoming increasingly quirky). Good work, too, from the jubilant swing and mellow, rounded sound of vibraharpist Joe Locke, the Herbie Hancockish harmonies of pianist Michael Cain, and the airily original Eubanks. Cain's contribution to Claire Fischer's Latin shuffler Morning is a good example of how to avoid the usual licks in the Lat-Am jazz idiom - it starts with a strange, inquisitive figure and drapes deceptively relaxed lines over it, but always returns to a slightly anxious insistence. But for a session populated by such pedigree sidemen, the overall impact is surprisingly becalmed.",

It is a liturgical setting, with text (in English) expanded from the Ordinary of the Mass, which he wrote for the millennium celebrations at Westminster Cathedral. Closer in style to Britten than to Tavener, MacMillan is distinctive in his brilliant use of choral effects, with surging crescendos to stir the blood: it is music of high voltage from first to last. Equally, the shorter choral works on the disc, all written in the 1990s, have a rare concentration, often involving powerful slabs of sound.

Her Orph\u00e9e is less than harrowing; her Iphig\u00e9nie suggests nostalgic wistfulness rather than desperation. Bicket, seemingly anxious to avoid stolidity, hectors her at times.

Striking fanfare motifs bring echoes of Hollywood film music; and, as in the Sebastian Suite, the ostinatos echo Stravinsky.

      "body": "<p><strong> Shaggy </strong> Hot Shot<br> (MCA) *** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> As Freaky Girl settles into its jogging groove, Orville \"Shaggy\" Burrell growls over The Kraft's Stakhanovite vocal legwork and lets slip a chuckle. In an instant, its good-natured lasciviousness encapsulates the unlikely but undisputed king of reggae. Shaggy's shtick is straightforward but appealing. His love songs - girl meets Shaggy, girl wants Shaggy, Shaggy obliges - are platforms to discuss his bedtime prowess (\"Passion and ecstasy; you know the drill\", he explains on Not Fair) or his life as a sexually active superstar. It is invariably harmless fluff, but Shaggy is often a spectator on his own album: Dance &amp; Shout heavily samples Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), while Hope is a close relation of Love of the Common People. Shaggy does not sing as such, so he gets others to do it. Yet, when he growls against a choir on Joy You Bring or duets with Samantha Cole on the naughty Luv Me Luv Me, he is impossible to dislike. In fact, he is a guilty delight. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Neil Finn </strong> One Nil<br> (Parlophone) *** <br> \u00a315.99<br> </p> <p> Since disbanding Crowded House - effectively his solo project - in 1996, Neil Finn is not quite what he used to be. For all its careful crafting, One Nil offers no melody to eclipse his past, nor is there a phrase to compare with \"Everywhere you go, always take the weather with you\". Even so, Finn will never make a poor album, and One Nil grows in stature with each hearing. Wendy and Lisa, once of Prince's Revolution, are frequent collaborators: they supply lumpen beats to Rest of the Day and Don't Ask Why, but they also put a renewed spring in Finn's step on the inspired Elastic Heart and the feisty single Wherever You Are. More than many lesser talents, Finn is responsible for his career curve: married for more than 20 years, unwilling to uproot from Australia or New Zealand, he was never superstar material. One Nil - quality throughout, but with a lingering feeling of what might have been - suggests he has accepted his fate with dignity. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Antibalas' Afrobeat Orchestra</strong> Liberation Afrobeat Vol 1 <br>(Ninja Tune) *** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> Martin Antibalas and his friends are a rousing curiosity: a Brooklyn-based band consisting of at least 14 members, determined to revive and update the tradition of Nigeria's greatest musical rebel, Fela Kuti. Fela's Afrobeat style was a mixture of traditional Yoruba music, funk and jazz, and involved lengthy instrumental passages and chanting vocal work-outs in which he could vent his fury at Nigeria's military rulers. There's not quite the same sense of danger in the US,but the Antibalas team strive hard for that tense Lagos feel. Their long songs have titles like Uprising and World War IV, and follow the Afrobeat format, though with a slick veneer. Like many US revivalist bands, they are strong on skill and technique, but less good at innovation; and, inevitably, they can't match Fela's sense of anger, excitement and musical bravery. That said, they are a lively, stylish band, with strong keyboards, brass and percussion. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Cesaria Evora </strong> Sao Vicente di Longe<br> (BMG/RCA Victor) *** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Now rightly established as a best-selling international star, Cesaria Evora has moved on from exploring the music of her home (the Cape Verde Islands, off the coast of west Africa), which fuses African and Portuguese styles, to explore that music's links with other Afro-Latin styles across the Atlantic. She has been given the full superstar treatment, with recording sessions in Havana, Rio and Paris, and a supporting cast of nearly 60 musicians, arrangers and engineers. Was it worth it? Well, her intimate voice is as distinctive as ever, but those immaculately recorded orchestras of sweeping strings and guitars often sound out of place, and at times there's a clash between her thoughtful approach and that of the musicians, who sound desperate to get up and dance. Evora's singing may have a limited emotional range, but when it comes to languid melancholia she's in a class of her own. That's true here on the cool, sad Ponta De Fi, which marks her song-writing debut; Regresso, a collaboration with Brazil's Caetano Veloso; and an exquisite, piano-backed treatment of the Brazilian standard Negue. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Martin Carthy </strong> The Carthy Chronicles<br> (Free Reed, 4 CDs) **** <br> \u00a339.99<br> </p> <p> Martin Carthy is a disconcertingly unassuming celebrity. He's the finest, most versatile guitarist on the folk scene, but there's been a danger in recent years that his achievements could be overlooked as attention has focused on his wife Norma Waterson and daughter Eliza Carthy. So here's an impressive 83-track box set to put that right. The music - over five hours' worth - is remarkably varied, but this intriguing, patchy compilation gives only a taster of all that Carthy has done, both as a soloist and in several acoustic and electric bands, including the Albion Band, Brass Monkey and the folk family supergroup Waterson:Carthy. There's a bit of everything here, from his early work in the 1960s when - fresh from backing Bob Dylan - he worked with topical song-writer Leon Rosselson and that other guitar hero, Davy Graham (with whom he can be heard performing anything from Leadbelly songs to the South African standard, Wimoweh). He's been happy to treat traditional songs in a variety of styles, and the solo acoustic work is matched by some brave, experimental work from an early Steeleye Span line-up. The CD devoted to his treatments of contemporary songs is somewhat odd (why not include his masterful treatment of Heartbreak Hotel?) but features rousing versions of Richard Thompson and Dylan classics. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Run-DMC </strong> Grand Royal <br>(MCA) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Longevity is not a concept associated with a career in hip-hop. The genre's gun obsession means there hasn't been a popular entertainment with an equivalent mortality rate since men stopped traversing Niagara Falls in barrels. Rappers who cheat death face seeing their careers extinguished by the vagaries of fashion - witness Vanilla Ice, who now presents a car restoration show on Granada Men and Motors. Such tales make Run-DMC's continued success more startling. Eighteen years after their debut, the trio's trademark sound - hectoring vocals over crunching guitars - is back in vogue thanks to rap-metal bands like Limp Bizkit. Fred Durst is among the guests on an album that finds Run-DMC unsure whether to pursue the rap-metal style or explore more straightforward hip-hop. The uneven results veer from a fearful cover of Steve Miller's Take the Money and Run to the pleasingly experimental beats of It's Over. The album doesn't live up either to the trio's reputation or their wearying braggadocio, but with most of their peers dead or forgotten, Run-DMC are probably just happy to still be here. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Clearlake </strong> Lido <br>(Dusty Company) ** <br> \u00a38.99<br> </p> <p> Like a weird fusion of Nick Cave and EastEnders, Clearlake's Jason Pegg finds melodrama in mundanity. In Sunday Evening he mourns \"There isn't much on except Songs of Praise\" in the voice of one whose dog has just died; Something to Look Forward To complains that \"Every single day is like the one before\". It's tempting to say the same about Clearlake's songs. The music - silvery, jaunty guitarwork and shooting-star orchestration from Sam Hewitt on keyboards and \"devices\" - sometimes lacks variation, but the real problem is Pegg's voice. Even in the dinky love ditty I Hang on Every Word You Say, his voice is trapped in a whine. There are a couple of gems on Lido, the twinkly I Want to Live in a Dream and Jumble Sailing, a lovely celebration of second-hand grubbing, swirling with angelic carol-like melodies and drifting harps. They are boulders to cling to while the rest of the album has you sinking in sludge. (MC) </p> <p><strong> Stereophonics </strong> Just Enough Education to Perform <br>(V2) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> From thoughts of suicide to musical travelogue, Stereophonics appear consumed with the notion of getting away from it all. Descriptions of dissatisfaction and the big dreams lurking beneath the veneer of normality meet light harmonies and gentle rhythms on a diverse, suffocating album. While rumours of Kelly Jones becoming Kenny Rogers prove unfounded, there is a country flavour here, especially in the waltzing slide guitar and harmonica of Step on My Old Size Nines. Their anthemic angst isn't as overwhelming as on previous efforts, replaced by an understated combination of cynicism and sunshine. Mr Writer, with its funked-up wah-wah guitars and glistening sarcasm, is the stand-out track, Jones's sandpaper vocals and lyrics sharpened by having a focus. If the slow-building anxiety of Rooftop is anything to go by, Stereophonics could do with some time out. (BC) </p> <p><strong> Roxette </strong> Room Service<br> (EMI) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> If Roxette's leather trousers and footballer highlights are an incongruous spectacle in the 21st century, their sound is even more out of sync. The Swedish Eurythmics are still chipping away at the same power-pop coalface as they were in 1989, when The Look became the first of 21 fantastically unmemorable hits. As ever, singer Marie Fredriksson is the brittle focal point, compelling yet curiously unengaged as she tries to negotiate Per Gessle's lyrics. His attempt at a social conscience on Jefferson is scuppered by one of the worst first verses in history: \"Jefferson was always out of luck/ I remember when we both grew up/ Jefferson got hit by a westbound truck/ I guess that didn't make him look like a million bucks.\" Yet a few tracks, such as the tinny Make My Head Go Pop and Real Sugar, are redeemed by choruses so insistent they quash all resistance. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Nash </strong> The Chancer <br>(Go Beat) *** <br> \u00a310.99<br> </p> <p> This introduction to oddbod singer-guitarist Russell Nash is reminiscent of Merz, who had a bewitchingly woozy hit with Many Weathers Apart. Nash and programmer Steve Ellington operate in similar R&amp;B-based, anything-goes territory. The single 100 Million Ways is a happy accident of soul, reggae and (forgive them) Jamiroquai, bookended by the ambiguous query \"Will I ever see the day that paints a picture and frees me of addiction?\" It contrives to be irresistible, and is a hard act to follow for the other 13 songs, which never hit the same luscious peak. But if Black Box loses its lysergic marbles and Breakaway could be a Lighthouse Family outtake, Nash's fluid voice is consistently a thing of beauty. (CS)</p>",

It is the project on which she was working when she died of ovarian cancer four years ago this Sunday, aged 49, and it represents a precious addition to the luminous output of nine studio albums and two live recordings that attracted admiration and affection over the three decades of her career, even though she never truly fulfilled the music industry's early expectation that she would become one of the most popular performers of her generation. </p> <p>She was in her teens when she wrote And When I Die, Wedding Bell Blues and Stoney End, big pop hits in the late 1960s for Blood, Sweat and Tears, the Fifth Dimension and Barbra Streisand respectively. Think about that - a 17-year-old composing And When I Die, with its tumbling structure and that blithely morbid lyric: \"My troubles are many/ They're as deep as a well/ I swear there ain't no heaven/ And I pray there ain't no hell.\" And she was barely 20 when she wrote Eli and the Thirteenth Confession, her second album, a cycle of 13 songs full of astonishingly sophisticated musicianship and a young woman's wildheart poetry: \"Silver was the colour/ Winter was a snowbell/ Mother of the windboys/ Living off the lovewell.\" </p> <p>If her later work was often inconsistent and lacked the romantic gestures of those early street-corner arias, that only seemed to be a natural consequence of her involvement in motherhood, radical feminism and animal rights, to each of which she dedicated songs that veered away from poetry towards didacticism. Yet she never really lost her gift. The song Walk the Dog and Light the Light, the title track from the last album released during her lifetime, is a beauty, and so is the wonderful Companion, from her 1989 Live at the Bottom Line set. The concerts of her last years, whether in surroundings as appropriate as Islington's Union Chapel or in the indifferent setting of a hotel lounge in middle America, were always faithful, compelling representations of her uncompromising talent. </p> <p>Angel in the Dark is just about everything her fans could wish for: almost an hour's worth of original songs and covers of old favourites, of voice-and-piano performances and pieces accompanied by a small band of crack musicians including the drummer Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie, the guitarist John Tropea and the Brecker brothers, Randy and Michael, on trumpet and tenor saxophone. It finds Nyro fully engaged with life and love of all kinds. </p> <p>Several songs on which she deploys the band - notably Sweet Dream Fade, Gardenia Talk, Don't Hurt Child and the title tune - have the informal feeling of very superior demos, and are all the better for the lack of sweetening. The arrangements are fresh and taut, close in style to Van Morrison's Moondance band, which means no messing about, no long solos - just a bunch of grooves placed right in the pocket, allowing the songs to speak. </p> <p>Almost 30 years ago, in the collection called Gonna Take a Miracle, she reinterpreted the teen anthems of her subway adolescence. Here the mature woman reflects on the authentic poetry of Gerry Goffin's lyric to Will You Love Me Tomorrow, examines the naive loveliness of Thom Bell's La La Means I Love You, croons Smokey Robinson's ineffable Ooo Baby Baby, and finds a different and successful approach to Bacharach and David's Walk On By. Here and there you can sense where she would have added vocal harmonies, had there been time. </p> <p>She was at her most intense when alone with the piano, as anyone whose memory goes back to her London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1971 will attest. In these performances of He Was Too Good to Me and Serious Playground there is no gap whatsoever between the performer and her material. </p> <p>In musical and emotional terms, she was the mother of such adventuresses as Rickie Lee Jones and Mary Margaret O'Hara, although she cannot be blamed for the subsequent generation of show-offs and therapy queens, and her failure to find a larger audience of her own remains a bit of a mystery. Maybe there was something too naked about her voice, too uncomfortable about its pronounced break between registers. Perhaps the structures of her music were too grown-up, too well-crafted, too rooted in the cadences of Brill Building pop-soul songwriting, to satisfy the tastes of the broad rock audience. Possibly she suffered for wanting to write poetically about her acceptance of an ability to love both men and women without being interested in exploiting its publicity value. Her songs were drawn from her life, which should be all that we need to know. And it will be a big surprise if any singer-songwriter, of whatever gender or generation, releases anything this year remotely as accomplished and affecting as these last offerings from an artist of genuine and enduring originality.</p>",

The promotion of civil liberties is a precondition for valuing diversity and recognising that conformity is not an indicator of people's value - in the workplace or anywhere else. Organisations like Mad Pride and Survivors Speak Out are building links with movements such as Gay Pride and Disability Rights, which have resisted attempts to medicalise and pathologise their experiences and have fought under a civil liberties banner. Tomorrow sees the launch of Hats Off, a celebration of survival, resistance to labelling and the achievements of people with mental health problems. A Hats Off award has been established for the person who has done most to promote the civil liberties of people with mental health problems. It's not too late to take action and receive a nomination more valuable than any Oscar.",

Through its catwalk collaborations, whether it be with John Galliano for spring/summer, or Yohji Yamamoto for autumn/winter, the sportswear brand has proven that it can keep pace with the quickest minds in fashion. </p> <p>At Galliano, Adidas was behind the football boots and shinpads worn by his Jesus-as-soccer-star models.

Through its catwalk collaborations, whether it be with John Galliano for spring/summer, or Yohji Yamamoto for autumn/winter, the sportswear brand has proven that it can keep pace with the quickest minds in fashion.

Game, set and match to Bush? Not so fast. For if the recount had taken place and had followed the counting standard favoured - if that's the word, which it isn't - by the Bush camp during the 36-day battle for Florida, then Gore would have won. By three votes. Talk about a squeaker.</p> <p>That's not all, though. The Miami Herald/USA Today survey is far from being the last word on the disputed count, whichever of its findings you choose to believe. Right now, there is a further, bigger and still more painstaking survey under way, sponsored by such aristocrats of American journalism as the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN.</p> <p>The results of that survey are expected some time later this month. They will take into account not just the \"undervotes\" but also the \"overvotes\", in which - remember the Palm Beach 18,000? - lots of voters punched more than one name on the ballot paper. The word on the grapevine is that this survey will show a decisive Gore victory.</p> <p>Well, perhaps it will and perhaps it won't. On one level, of course, it simply does not matter any longer. George Bush was declared the winner in Florida back in December, and nothing is going to undeclare his victory. In the view of a lot of people - mostly Republicans, for obvious reasons - it's time to accept the outcome and move on.</p> <p>But this is where the inescapability of the Florida election issue takes the unexpected turn which I mentioned at the start. Last week, the United States Census Bureau published the results of the 2000 head count for Florida. Here, as in several other states - and, indeed, in the US as a whole - the big story was the dramatic increase in the Hispanic population, a change which is changing the face of America itself.</p> <p>In Florida, the rise and rise of the Hispanic population is as pronounced as anywhere in the country. There is not a single county among Florida's 67 counties in which the Hispanic population rose by less than 30 per cent in the preceding decade. The increase was heavy in our old favourites Broward (up 151 per cent), Palm Beach (up 111 per cent) and Miami-Dade (up 35 per cent), but it was even heavier in the counties in the middle of the state, around Orlando and Tampa, like Orange county (up 159 per cent), Osceola (up 294 per cent) and De Soto (up 251 per cent).</p> <p>These steep growth curves are set to continue for many years to come. The important thing to notice - and you can see it from the selection of counties mentioned above - is that the traditional Hispanic centres like Dade (where 57 per cent of the inhabitants are now Hispanic) are not the areas of fastest growth. Politically, that distinction is very important, because it underscores that the rapid transformation of Florida's population is coming not from the Cubans of Dade but from the non-Cubans elsewhere.</p> <p>Boil it all down, and what you have is a state which is moving inexorably from the hands of the Republicans (who win among the non-Hispanic whites and among the Cubans) towards the Democrats (whose greatest strength lies among the blacks and the non-Cuban Hispanics). In each presidential election from 1972 to 1988, the Republican candidate held Florida with an average of 60 per cent of the vote. In 1992, George Bush Sr just held on against Bill Clinton, but in 1996 Clinton became the first Democrat in a generation to win Florida. Last year, the state was in effect a dead heat.</p> <p>But the trend is clear. Florida is leaning to the left. It has become a swing state. And because it is a big state - don't forget those 25 electoral college votes - it is now the most important one. As Ronald Brownstein of the Los Angeles Times pointed out this week, \"Florida is simply the state most likely to tilt the overall result toward the winner.\"</p> <p>The 2000 election may have been a mess, but it didn't lie. Florida was the battleground state of the 2000 election because it is now the battleground state of any presidential election. So, you had better get used to it. You aren't going to hear less about Florida in elections to come.

As the chanting grew louder, they unwrapped bundles of steel knives attached to chains and began beating themselves on their backs, shouting \"Hussain, Hussain\". The blood-soaked ceremony is an annual ritual for Shia Muslims across the world, but in Pakistan this year it comes at a time of renewed sectarian tension. In a string of violent outbreaks between the Sunni community and the minority Shias - who make up 20% of Pakistan's 140m population - more than 50 people have been killed in the past two months. In Karachi on Wednesday, a bus driver found a bomb under his front seat and managed to defuse it. A Shia procession was due to pass by minutes later. Just 24 hours earlier, a former leader of a Shia Muslim group was shot dead by gunmen on a motorbike, near Multan, in the centre of the country. Reports say that there are up to 10,000 trained sectarian terrorists in Pakistan, supplied with arms from caches in mosques across the country. Riot police and heavily armed soldiers are now patrolling Rawalpindi and other cities across the country in a bid to prevent further attacks. In Lahore alone, 10,000 soldiers were on duty for the Shia procession - the country's biggest. The procession of mourners dressed in black shalwar kameez suits commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the grandson of the prophet Mohammad, who died in 680AD in Karbala, in modern-day Iraq. The Ashura ceremony is the culmination of 10 days of mourning in Muharram, the first month of the Muslim year. But for all the recent upsurge in violence, most in the crowd at Rawalpindi appeared unconcerned by the threat. \"This day is most sacred for us. We are ready to die for this day,\" said Ahmed Ali, a 26-year-old web page designer from Islamabad. \"Things are becoming difficult now. The other sects are very organised and they think if they kill us they will go straight to heaven. But I don't think most people in Pakistan agree with them. For the past 50 years, we have lived peacefully in Pakistan. Why can't that continue?\" As the men beat deep cuts into their backs, women stood on the side of the road, dressed in black veils, beating their chests with the rest of the crowd. At one point, a white horse - signifying that which Hussain rode in battle - was led into the centre of the crowd, and hands reached out to touch the animal. Many of the men, already carrying scars on their backs from last year, came away with bloody wounds needing medical treatment. The knives ranged in size from just a few inches long to over a foot, and several young boys had joined in the self-flagellation. Every few minutes, when a mourner's injuries appeared to become too serious, the crowd would push forward and wrestle the blades from his hand. Across the border in Afghanistan, the hardline Sunni Muslim Taliban this week allowed Shias - again in the minority - to mark Ashura for the first time since they seized power nearly five years ago. Many of Pakistan's most wanted Sunni sectarian terrorists are believed to be in hiding in Afghanistan, protected by their close links to the Taliban.

They were crammed so tightly into the truck that they each had only the space of an A4 sheet of paper in which to crouch. There were just four small containers of water for a nine-hour journey from Rotterdam. Their fate was sealed when the driver closed the one air vent in the back of his truck to ensure no ferry official heard their voices and caught him red-handed. But he knew the danger to which he was exposing them. A fellow gang driver had released his \"cargo\" on a similar run just two months earlier, when air in his truck ran out. Perry Wacker, the Dutch driver, was sentenced to 14 years in prison yesterday. </p> <p>There are three lessons which can be drawn from this terrible event. First, there is nothing romantic about the organised gangs involved in the illegal immigrant trade. They are ruthless and extremely well-organised. The 60 Chinese immigrants came from a remote Chinese province by plane from Beijing to Belgrade, and then via road and air through Hungary, Austria, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. They paid up to \u00a320,000 each for the journey - some up front and the rest promised over a period of years. In other words, slave labourers for the organised gang. The ruthlessness of such gangs knows no limits. In the last three years in Italy, at least 200 would-be immigrants have died at sea in collisions with custom boats or after being thrown overboard. Five years ago almost 300 died in a single incident. </p> <p>A second lesson is that the heavy sentence handed down yesterday will not deter the trade. Tighter laws and heavier penalties introduced after Dover failed too. As David Wilson, head of intelligence for the immigration services, has noted: \"The harder we make it, the more lucrative we make it for organised gangs.\" People smuggling is still not as profitable as drug smuggling, but an estimated 7m illegal immigrants are brought to Europe every year. Estimates of total turnover for the gangs worldwide ranges between \u00a38bn and \u00a320bn. </p> <p>So what will reduce the illegal flow? That is the third lesson. Fifteen years ago there was no organised illegal trade. It emerged as Europe became ever more restrictive towards refugees and immigrants. Yet across Europe, ministers are complaining about labour shortages and the need for more economic migrants. Germany has just introduced a green card scheme, under which more economic migrants will be accepted. British ministers - Jack Straw and Barbara Roche - tried to start a grown up debate last year about the skills shortage in the UK. The one positive result of the Dover tragedy was the way in which it rallied tabloid support for an increase in controlled immigration. Even the Sun discovered \"rich nations need immigrants if we are to prosper\". </p> <p>The emerging consensus is welcome. Awkward challenges remain. There are shortages of unskilled as well as skilled workers. Third world countries must not be robbed of their skilled labour - teachers, social workers, nurses, and doctors are in even shorter supply there. A common European approach is crucial. At least this last challenge is already agreed. The 1997 Amsterdam treaty conceded power to create a common immigration policy to the European parliament.

      "bodyText": "The government will today announce \u00a3120m of guaranteed loans to the hard pressed tourist industry. Ministers confirmed yesterday that bookings are down 10% across the country and up to 80% in the worst hit areas of Cumbria and Devon. The loans package is designed to tide the industry over its growing cash crisis, but is unlikely to be seen as enough by the many small rural tourist businesses on the edge of collapse. The English regional tourist boards estimate they are losing \u00a3200m a week in revenue, and the figure could be four times greater over Easter, which often represents as much as 10% of the industry's annual takings. The loans will be announced by the culture secretary, Chris Smith, alongside \u00a36m in subsidies to increase marketing by the English Tourism Council and the British Tourism Authority. Mr Smith warned the cabinet yesterday that the danger of \"significantly reduced\" bookings for the summer was now serious. The package has been worked up in urgent talks between the Department of Culture, Downing Street and the Treasury. The money is on top of existing rate relief and VAT holidays. The Conservatives are likely to claim that the package follows their own call for interest free loans of up to \u00a310,000. The tourist industry will claim the assistance is dwarfed by the huge compensation payments being prepared for farmers. But as President Bush told the Scottish first minister, Henry McLeish, in Washington that he \"empathised with the UK\" - and the European parliament snubbed Britain by voting overwhelmingly to call for a review of the non-vaccination policy - there were clear signs that government was becoming deeply frustrated at local councils in unaffected parts of the country. Mr Blair has already met council leaders to urge them to take a common sense approach to footpath closures but large areas still have blanket bans. The government found an unexpected ally in Sir Sean Connery, who was in Washington. \"You will find our majestic countryside open,\" he said. Agriculture minister Nick Brown, who told cabinet members that he would be spending much of the Easter holidays at his ministry's headquarters, advised caution however, saying that the epidemic might be levelling off but no risks could be taken. \"This is a very serious outbreak which is likely to have a long tail,\" he told MPs as some pressed for faster cull-and-bury policies and others urged relaxation of restrictions on the movement of animals in unaffected areas. The problem facing vets was multiplied by the fact that for every reported case of foot and mouth confirmed, there were two that turned out to be false alarms, Mr Brown said. Compensation payments to farmers were now approaching \u00a3600 million, Downing Street said. About 1,600 soldiers are working on foot and mouth in 14 areas of the country.

The debate is about democracy: what terms and conditions will poor countries be told they must meet to qualify for trade and investment?</p> <p>For the past two decades, these terms and conditions have been negotiated and enforced by the IMF and the World Bank in exchange for loans. Social services have been privatised, user fees introduced, agricultural subsidies cut (while richer countries kept theirs), hard-won land redistribution programs abandoned, and the minimum wage has been controlled - all in the name of becoming \"investment ready\".</p> <p>Argentina, the host of the current FTAA ministers' meeting, is currently in open revolt over massive cuts to social spending - almost $8bn over three years - that have been introduced to qualify for an IMF loan package. Three cabinet ministers have resigned, unions staged a general strike, and university instructors moved their classes to the streets.</p> <p>Though anger at wrenching austerity measures has focused primarily on the IMF, it is rapidly expanding to encompass trade deals such as the proposed FTAA.

And despite the claims that the rest of Latin America is clamouring for a Nafta to call its own, the central labour associations of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - representing 20m workers - have come out against the plan. They are now calling for nationwide referendums on membership in the FTAA.</p> <p>Brazil, meanwhile, has threatened to boycott the summit altogether, furious at Canada's dirty trade war and wary that the FTAA will contain protections for drug companies that will threaten its visionary public health policy of providing free generic Aids drugs to anyone who needs them.</p> <p>Defenders of free trade would have us believe in a facile equation of Trade = Democracy. The people who will greet American trade ministers on the streets of Buenos Aires next week are posing a more complex and challenging calculation: how much democracy should they be asked to give up in exchange for trade?</p> <p>\u0095 Naomi Klein writes a fortnightly column</p>",

Social services have been privatised, user fees introduced, agricultural subsidies cut (while richer countries kept theirs), hard-won land redistribution programs abandoned, and the minimum wage has been controlled - all in the name of becoming \"investment ready\". Argentina, the host of the current FTAA ministers' meeting, is currently in open revolt over massive cuts to social spending - almost $8bn over three years - that have been introduced to qualify for an IMF loan package. Three cabinet ministers have resigned, unions staged a general strike, and university instructors moved their classes to the streets. Though anger at wrenching austerity measures has focused primarily on the IMF, it is rapidly expanding to encompass trade deals such as the proposed FTAA. The Zapatistas began their uprising on January 1 1994 - the day the North American Free Trade Agreement came into force. Seven years later, 75% of the population of Mexico lives in poverty, real wages are lower than they were in 1994, and unemployment is rising. No wonder the Zapatistas were able to draw 150,000 supporters to the streets of Mexico City last month. And despite the claims that the rest of Latin America is clamouring for a Nafta to call its own, the central labour associations of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - representing 20m workers - have come out against the plan. They are now calling for nationwide referendums on membership in the FTAA. Brazil, meanwhile, has threatened to boycott the summit altogether, furious at Canada's dirty trade war and wary that the FTAA will contain protections for drug companies that will threaten its visionary public health policy of providing free generic Aids drugs to anyone who needs them. Defenders of free trade would have us believe in a facile equation of Trade = Democracy. The people who will greet American trade ministers on the streets of Buenos Aires next week are posing a more complex and challenging calculation: how much democracy should they be asked to give up in exchange for trade? \u0095 Naomi Klein writes a fortnightly column",

The road goes through wondrously beautiful forested hills, the paler colours of cypress and birch in feathery contrast to the general greenery. The scenes at each end are uglier, but not notably different from each other.</p> <p>A warm spring sun shines down on graffiti-mottled council estates, their rubbish-filled courtyards haunted by despondent dogs. They open out on to vistas dominated by the overblown public buildings of the socialist era, rebadged with new national symbols.

Ministers were last night said to be angry that Virgin had used the aftermath of the Hatfield rail disaster to justify putting up fares. The company was accused of \"acting perversely\". The strategic rail authority has agreed to meet Virgin shareholders next week to hear their concerns about the company's profitability over the next 12 months, at a time when it is getting ready to introduce high speed trains on its intercity and cross country routes. The SRA is likely to tell Virgin that the industry is in the private sector and that companies such as Virgin must accept that there will always be good times and bad. Even so, some government sources pointed out that if the rail companies acted together and presented their post-Hatfield case it might be possible to cushion them with extra money. This could lead Virgin to freeze its fares, if not from May 21 then in the future. A spokesman for the prime minister said the rail companies had to make judgments about getting the necessary investment and how they could best attract people back to train travel. News of Virgin's proposed fare increases was received with widespread hostility. Stewart Francis, chairman of the rail passengers' council, said they were unacceptable and called on the industry to \"stop fleecing passengers\".

      "bodyText": "The first work to rule by family doctors was agreed yesterday by the British Medical Association in protest against an \"unsustainable\" burden of administrative work that is taking time away from patient care. The association's GPs committee told its 32,000 members in England and Wales to boycott the form filling needed to comply with national strategies for cancer, heart disease and care of older people. Simon Fradd, the committee's deputy chairman, said the move amounted to \"non-compliance\" with government directions, and it was likely to be the first of a series of actions in protest at excessive workload. The boycott did not count as industrial action because at least 95% of GPs did not have these administrative duties in their contracts, he said. About 1,000 GPs on personal contracts would be exempted if the boycott required them to breach their conditions. There was therefore no requirement for a ballot under industrial relations law. \"We have reached the stage where we believe it is in the public interest to cut out work that is not essential to make sure the job can be done safely in terms of clinical care,\" Dr Fradd said. GPs would be told to stop writing reports for health authorities and primary care trusts, as the government required to demonstrate improvements in programmes to combat killer diseases and raise the standard of care for older people. For example, they would follow government guidelines for screening patients for high blood pressure but would not collate the data to provide ministers with the evidence to score political points. The move was a further embarrassment for ministers, who are braced for a BMA offensive during the general election campaign. The association is preparing a patients' dossier showing the suffering caused in the NHS when doctors are forced to cut corners. The BMA said the \"national service frameworks\" for priority NHS work were \"laudable in their intention to raise the standards of care for patients\" but gave rise to an unsustainable burden on GPs to monitor and report on the delivery of that care. GPs should do their utmost to fulfil the clinical aspects of the government's plan but stop taking time away from patient care to meet the associated requests for information. \"When patients are ill, they want to be able to see their doctors, not to find that their GP is having to undertake administrative tasks to satisfy a government that has steadfastly refused to listen,\" the BMA said. Dr Fradd said the government's NHS plan was raising patients' expectations about what GPs could deliver. \"We are seeking ways to reduce workload to give a better deal to the public. \"Nobody can give consistently safe care in consultations lasting a national average of eight minutes. You can't do a proper job for patients in that time. We have to find ways to reduce hours spent on work that is not relevant to patient care.\" The GPs' action follows a warning from Ian Bogle, the BMA chairman, that patients' safety was being put at risk because doctors did not have enough time for consultations. \"Consulting times are getting lower. Therefore, patients are not getting the quality of service they need and deserve and, from the doctors' point of view, if they are cutting corners - and they may well be in short consultations - they are putting their careers at risk,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, said: \"I am increasingly concerned that doctors are being forced into unsafe medical practices in order to meet arbitrary government targets. \"I agree with Dr Bogle that rushed consultations and less time with patients increases the risk of mistakes being made.\"",

      "bodyText": "A trust chairman who has never had a full-time job in the health service but who emerged last year as a key architect of the NHS plan has been appointed as the \u00a3100,000 a year NHS head of human resources. Property company director Andrew Foster, who has been involved in NHS HR policy - mostly on a part-time basis - for just five years, and the NHS - also on a part-time basis - for just nine years, will take up the job in May. He and the NHS confederation are credited with an influential role in the development of HR policy in the NHS plan, which promises more investment in nurses and doctors, and improved pay and training for staff. Mr Foster is in many ways an astonishing appointment - it is believed to be unprecedented for a trust chairman to be appointed to a senior NHS executive management position. It is also rare for someone with no track record in the civil service or as a career NHS manager to take up such a key post at the Department of Health - although ministers have been reportedly keen to attract private sector talent to the NHS. It seems likely that Mr Foster's work with the confederation on the HR policy work that fed into the NHS plan impressed ministers and senior civil servants. NHS chief executive Nigel Crisp admitted as much when he said: \"Andrew's work at the NHS confederation has shown that he is an excellent candidate for the job.\" Mr Foster, 46, will have responsibility for solving the health service's chronic staff recruitment and retention problem, redesigning the NHS pay system and developing staff skills. For the past year he has worked for the NHS confederation as human resources policy director and has chaired its human resources committee since 1996. Mr Foster has been a director of a family property company, Worldcrest, based in Wigan, since 1981, although it is understood that much of his time over the past five years has been devoted to his NHS work. Previous to that he worked in a series of jobs for Rowntrees, the confectionery manufacturer, as a graduate trainee. He was appointed as chairman of the then West Lancashire NHS trust by the Conservative government in 1992 - now the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS trust - and is a member of the NHS workforce task force set up to implement the NHS plan.",

      "body": "<p>A clay mound the size of a football pitch to be filled with 30,000 decomposing sheep and cattle has been suggested for the west country to solve a crisis of unburied animals.</p> <p>The Ministry of Agriculture is so desperate about carcasses lying in fields and barns that it refuses any longer to publish the figures, and is considering the mound plan, put forward by the National Farmers' Union.</p> <p>It was suggested to the farmers by Ian White, regional waste manager for the environment agency until he retired last year. He said that the clay lined mass grave would allow rapid mass burial.</p> <p>The mound would be drained at the bottom to prevent pollution getting into the water table - the main risk with burying carcasses.</p> <p>Dr White said that, because of continuous heavy rain, it was proving very difficult to find suitable burial sites. Although rendering carcasses was the best option, there was not enough capacity.</p> <p>He described his idea as being a simple engineering technique. \"We need a large flat field, which would be covered in a thick layer of impermeable clay, of which we have plenty in this area.</p> <p>\"Then the field would be surrounded by high banks, or bunds.\"</p> <p>He said these banks would need to be five to 10 metres high depending on the volume of animals to be buried, but either way would provide a large space to pile sheep and cattle carcasses.</p> <p>Dr White calculated that an area 60 metres by 30 metres by five metres high could take up to 30,000 sheep, but if cattle were buried as well it would need to be larger. Once filled, it would be sealed with a layer of clay on top. Gradually, as the carcasses decomposed, the mound would sink.</p> <p>\"It would be ike a very large stone age barrow by that stage,\" he said.</p> <p>Ian Johnson for the NFU in Devon said: \"We think this is a very good idea.</p> <p>\"Our members are desperate. It is very upsetting and unsavory, to put it mildly, to have your animals lying about for up to a week. The ministry has been concentrating on killing infected animals, but then the army has nowhere to take them.\"</p> <p>Over much of the country yesterday the ministry was clearly falling behind its targets of catching up.</p> <p>Although the disposal of animals has speeded up in Cumbria with the giant pit at Great Orton airfield, it has slowed elsewhere.</p> <p>There were 1,150,000 animals hit by foot and mouth, of which 385,000 were awaiting slaughter. An unknown number had been killed but were unburied.</p> <p>The ministry had published a daily figure until two days ago, but stopped doing so when the figure passed 192,000.</p> <p>Signs of the system breaking down were showing yesterday in the north east, acknowledged by the government chief scientist, David King, as a new hot spot.</p> <p>Among the 33 new cases yesterday, bringing the total to 1,058, was a farm at High Whinholme in Northallerton in North Yorkshire where there are 1,110 pigs and 670 sheep.</p> <p>This is the first case among pigs for some days - and a serious development, because pigs spread the virus much faster than other farm animals.</p> <p>North of England NFU leaders were warning that things could get \"10 times worse\", and felt they were losing the battle against foot and mouth disease because of too much \"bureaucracy\".</p> <p>The stark warning was issued following a meeting on Tyneside between farming union leaders and Pat Sellers, from the department of science and technology, a division of the Department of Trade and Industry.</p> <p>Despite her assurances that she was \"cautiously optimistic\" that the government's policy of culling infected animals within 24 hours, and those on neighbouring farms within 48 hours, would help beat the outbreak, NFU leaders said the Tyneside operation was not working quickly enough.</p> <p>Malcolm Corbett, chairman of the Northumberland NFU, said after the meeting: \"It was a depressing meeting from my point of view. Things are going from bad to worse.</p> <p>\"Having had this situation for six weeks now, you would think reasonably intelligent people would have learned lessons - but they have not. While they are fiddling in Cumbria, this problem is going to get 10 times worse in Northumberland.</p> <p>\"There does not seem to be the will or the common sense to grasp that, or to cut through bureaucratic nonsense and red tape to give people the resources they need to beat this disease.\"</p> <p>A mass incineration of carcasses at an airfield in Shropshire has been put on hold after protesters threatened legal action.</p> <p>Residents and businesses close to Tern Hill airfield, near Market Drayton, have expressed their concern at possible contamination from the pyre and its implications for health.

      "bodyText": "A clay mound the size of a football pitch to be filled with 30,000 decomposing sheep and cattle has been suggested for the west country to solve a crisis of unburied animals. The Ministry of Agriculture is so desperate about carcasses lying in fields and barns that it refuses any longer to publish the figures, and is considering the mound plan, put forward by the National Farmers' Union. It was suggested to the farmers by Ian White, regional waste manager for the environment agency until he retired last year. He said that the clay lined mass grave would allow rapid mass burial. The mound would be drained at the bottom to prevent pollution getting into the water table - the main risk with burying carcasses. Dr White said that, because of continuous heavy rain, it was proving very difficult to find suitable burial sites. Although rendering carcasses was the best option, there was not enough capacity. He described his idea as being a simple engineering technique. \"We need a large flat field, which would be covered in a thick layer of impermeable clay, of which we have plenty in this area. \"Then the field would be surrounded by high banks, or bunds.\" He said these banks would need to be five to 10 metres high depending on the volume of animals to be buried, but either way would provide a large space to pile sheep and cattle carcasses. Dr White calculated that an area 60 metres by 30 metres by five metres high could take up to 30,000 sheep, but if cattle were buried as well it would need to be larger. Once filled, it would be sealed with a layer of clay on top. Gradually, as the carcasses decomposed, the mound would sink. \"It would be ike a very large stone age barrow by that stage,\" he said. Ian Johnson for the NFU in Devon said: \"We think this is a very good idea. \"Our members are desperate. It is very upsetting and unsavory, to put it mildly, to have your animals lying about for up to a week. The ministry has been concentrating on killing infected animals, but then the army has nowhere to take them.\" Over much of the country yesterday the ministry was clearly falling behind its targets of catching up. Although the disposal of animals has speeded up in Cumbria with the giant pit at Great Orton airfield, it has slowed elsewhere. There were 1,150,000 animals hit by foot and mouth, of which 385,000 were awaiting slaughter. An unknown number had been killed but were unburied. The ministry had published a daily figure until two days ago, but stopped doing so when the figure passed 192,000. Signs of the system breaking down were showing yesterday in the north east, acknowledged by the government chief scientist, David King, as a new hot spot. Among the 33 new cases yesterday, bringing the total to 1,058, was a farm at High Whinholme in Northallerton in North Yorkshire where there are 1,110 pigs and 670 sheep. This is the first case among pigs for some days - and a serious development, because pigs spread the virus much faster than other farm animals. North of England NFU leaders were warning that things could get \"10 times worse\", and felt they were losing the battle against foot and mouth disease because of too much \"bureaucracy\". The stark warning was issued following a meeting on Tyneside between farming union leaders and Pat Sellers, from the department of science and technology, a division of the Department of Trade and Industry. Despite her assurances that she was \"cautiously optimistic\" that the government's policy of culling infected animals within 24 hours, and those on neighbouring farms within 48 hours, would help beat the outbreak, NFU leaders said the Tyneside operation was not working quickly enough. Malcolm Corbett, chairman of the Northumberland NFU, said after the meeting: \"It was a depressing meeting from my point of view. Things are going from bad to worse. \"Having had this situation for six weeks now, you would think reasonably intelligent people would have learned lessons - but they have not. While they are fiddling in Cumbria, this problem is going to get 10 times worse in Northumberland. \"There does not seem to be the will or the common sense to grasp that, or to cut through bureaucratic nonsense and red tape to give people the resources they need to beat this disease.\" A mass incineration of carcasses at an airfield in Shropshire has been put on hold after protesters threatened legal action. Residents and businesses close to Tern Hill airfield, near Market Drayton, have expressed their concern at possible contamination from the pyre and its implications for health.

Red Heart is understood to have foundered because of the differing aims of its two backers - Granada Media and the Seven Network. But Mr Jackson will be staying in Sydney to run a new standalone company set up by Granada. Granada and Seven are putting the finishing touches to an agreement to break up their 50/50 Red Heart joint venture, which was heralded as Australia's biggest production company when it was established just over a year ago. Mr Jackson will run a new Granada Australian production unit which will pitch ideas to other broadcasters in the country. It will still develop shows for Seven, but not have the first-look output deal Red Heart enjoyed. Meanwhile the Seven production staff and shows, including long-running soap Home and Away, that became part of Red Heart when it was set up in February last year are expected to return in-house. \"The Australian networks are very, very internally focused on what their schedules need,\" said Andrea Wonfor, executive chair of Granada Media International. \"Paul has gone down there and brought a huge energy to things. But there was a tension between supplying Seven and Red Heart's other activities. \"We've had a very constructive meeting with Seven and we are going to pull the two operations apart.\" Granada was looking to invest in programming that would sell internationally; while Seven was interested in shows tailored to its Australian audience. And because of Red Heart's first-look output deal with Seven, other Australian networks were reluctant to commission ideas that could have been rejected by their commercial rival. \"Australia is a very competitive market and it's much more difficult to establish relationships with all the channels in the way you can in the UK,\" said Ms Wonfor. \"We've now got to focus on building up those relationships and trust and get Paul working with the other channels.\" She added that the new Granada Australian outfit would still continue to work with Seven on particular formats and drama with international sales potential. Granada also still owns a stake of around 10% in Seven. Mr Jackson is expected to be involved in the shooting of the final episode of the next series of Cold Feet, which is to be shot in Australia.

      "bodyText": "For years it managed to convince us the French adored le Piat D'Or. Now the owner of the infamous wine brand is dropping the slogan from its advertising because the British no longer want to drink French wine. Piat D'Or is to be relaunched this summer with an advertising campaign that repositions it as the easy-drinking choice. The \u00a3500,000 campaign will introduce a new theme - \"Relax. It's Piat D'Or\" - and make no mention of the brand's French roots. \"France and the French are no longer as aspirational as they once were,\" said Emma Chamberlain, marketing manager for Piat D'Or. \"We're still a French wine but we've dropped 'Les Francais adorent le Piat D'Or' from our advertising and we're dropping the 'le' in the brand name. There will be less of an emphasis on France.\" Throughout the 1980s, le Piat D'Or was Britain's biggest-selling branded wine. Its opulent-looking red and gold labels and pseudo-French origins made it the wine of choice for the masses. The success of the brand owed much to the adverts, in which a beautiful young French woman introduces her English boyfriend to her father. The father reacts with disdain until the Englishman hands over a bottle of le Piat D'Or and all is resolved. In recent years the brand has slipped as new world wine brands such as Jacob's Creek and E&amp;J Gallo have become more popular. The relaunched Piat D'Or will hit the shelves in July and will have understated labels and a new flavour The advertising agency behind the new campaign is Dow Delaney Potter.",

Instead of jetting off to an exotic destination today the prospect of further catastrophic revelations may keep him at his desk for some time yet. </p> <p>Attempts by the palace to prevent the Sophie and Edward story from spinning out of control have proved more disastrous by the day. And with the Sunday tabloids circling, the royal family may be about enter the most damaging period since Andrew Morton's biography of Princess Diana in 1992 exposed the fiction of a happy and united family devoted to the service of the nation. There may need to be a scapegoat, and the handsomely-paid Mr Walker is first in the firing line. </p> <p>The Countess of Wessex's remarks to the \"middle Eastern businessman\" from the News of the World were bad enough, but the strategy of containment has been an unmitigated disaster.

      "bodyText": "Simon Walker, the public relations supremo seconded from British Airways to Buckingham Palace to devise a modern media strategy for the royal family, reckoned without the fake sheikh fiasco when he fixed his holiday plans. Instead of jetting off to an exotic destination today the prospect of further catastrophic revelations may keep him at his desk for some time yet. Attempts by the palace to prevent the Sophie and Edward story from spinning out of control have proved more disastrous by the day. And with the Sunday tabloids circling, the royal family may be about enter the most damaging period since Andrew Morton's biography of Princess Diana in 1992 exposed the fiction of a happy and united family devoted to the service of the nation. There may need to be a scapegoat, and the handsomely-paid Mr Walker is first in the firing line. The Countess of Wessex's remarks to the \"middle Eastern businessman\" from the News of the World were bad enough, but the strategy of containment has been an unmitigated disaster. The palace's efforts to paint her as a victim of entrapment got nowhere, as did the original strategy of pretending she had not said what she was quoted as saying about senior politicians and fellow members of the royal family. Her decision to send letters of apology to the figures she insulted was another spectacular error of judgment: it enabled other newspapers to verify the story independently. (It was not as if political sources were reticent - a royal disaster story conveniently took the heat off Tony Blair at the height of the foot and mouth crisis.)

But now the watchdog has fallen out spectacularly with Simon Walker down the road at the Queen's communications office. Internal royal communications have been disastrous too: the Prince of Wales knew nothing about the looming disaster until Sophie's letter of apology arrived last Friday afternoon. Since then he has been quietly seething in Balmoral, angry that Sophie had talked presumptuously of Diana and Camilla Parker Bowles, and decidedly unimpressed at Buckingham Palace's ineptitude.

It was claimed that on a six-day official tour of Malaysia and Brunei Prince Edward planned a programme on royal gardens which would feature the monarchs of both nations. Even the News of the World is in turmoil: reporters and some executives are furious that material it gathered ended up on the pages of its principal rivals.

Although, on the surface, just another successful businessman, he mixed with local people better than most - probably because of his Quaker education and Labour background. In this, he was like Malcolm Macdonald, Ramsay's son, who was then Britain's commissioner-general for south-east Asia.</p> <p>Few knew locally that Shepherd's father had become the first Baron Shepherd, having been elevated by Clement Attlee in 1946 as thanks for having organised Labour's landmark election victory 1945. He too became chief whip in the Lords. When his father died in 1954, young Shepherd took six months' leave to settle the family affairs, take his seat in the Lords, make a maiden speech and return to south-east Asia for another four years.</p> <p>In 1958, his company's headquarters moved to London, and his family returned home with it. After Labour lost the 1959 election, he took a job as a whip in the Lords, showing cunning if not brilliance. He devised a complex and inexpicable procedure known as \"Shepherd's pie\". When Labour won in 1964, Harold Wilson made him chief whip, or captain of the gentleman-at-arms. When Labour lost in 1970, he had to go to work for Sternberg, a fact he did not advertise.</p> <p>Labour's unexpected return to power in March 1974 enabled Shepherd to become leader of the Lords and Lord Privy Seal and, in October 1974, also minister for the civil service.

The commission, which was set up to advise on genetics policy but was not formally consulted about the proposals by the home secretary, is seeking changes before the radical measures become law. The commission's chairwoman, Lady Kennedy, a Labour peer and lawyer, warned that plans for the police to keep samples of suspects found innocent is \"a frightening move to a national database\". She said: \"Being on a database of potential offenders which might be regularly trawled by the police means that, in a very important sense, one is on a list of suspects and that surely very subtly alters the way in which the state sees and the way in which we see our fellow citizens.\" She suggested such a course would be seen as \"a major erosion of presumption of trust which which exists between us and the state\". She also warned the plan may be in breach of the European convention on human rights. Members of the commission believe that an independent body, as opposed to the police, should oversee the samples. The plan to keep DNA samples of anyone picked up by the police on suspicion of an offence is contained in the criminal justice and police bill, which has still to be considered by the Lords. The measure has the strong support of Tony Blair, and will be a key plank of Labour's manifesto if the measure does not reach the statue book before the election.

Over the next 10 years it will offer assignments, reading lists, outlines and notes on 2,000 courses on its website. The venture is intended to counter what it calls the \"privatisation of knowledge\". It will not give degrees to those using using the material on the MIT OpenCourseWare site. But the innovation could revolutionise e-learning and threaten the plans of universities which have seen internet courses as a source of revenue. The MIT president, Charles Vest, said: \"It will provide an extraordinary resource, free of charge, which others can adapt to their own needs.\" About 500 courses are likely to be made available within two years at a cost of $7.5m-10m. The ultimate cost is expected to be about $100m. William Jennings, vice-provost for professional and distance education at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, said MIT's decision \"may make all of us rethink the way we do things and encourage us all to be more open\".",

      "body": "<p>My agent, David Saunders at Agency for the Performing Arts, called me on a Sunday afternoon and he loved my script. Hell, I didn't even know David existed at the weekend. I figured that on Monday they just took him out of the casket and he went directly to his dark office in that big building on Sunset. But, yes, that was his voice on the phone and he was saying all those things a writer dies to hear. First thing in the morning, he enthused, I would be on the Yellow Brick Road - a golden path only slightly stained by my seven years of hacking scripts that were made into bad movies by even worse directors, producers and actors. </p> <p>The script went out, the responses came in, it was good. Very good. So good that super-producer John Davis (Predator, Grumpy Old Men, Grace Under Fire) wanted Fox studios to purchase it for him. </p> <p>Davis's offices are in the really nice section of Los Angeles. As soon as I parked my car, I knew this was the bigs. The underground lot was studded with BMWs, Benzes and other expensive German and Italian iron. Most people were in casual clothes, a sure sign that they were players - they didn't give a rat's ass what you thought of them. </p> <p>Standing at the portal to the Underworld, I glanced up at this imposing structure and couldn't help but reminisce on the whacked path that had led me here. </p> <p><strong>Wavy-line SFX as we flashback to... </strong></p> <p>Producer's office: young writer meets professional producer. Some illusions are shattered. </p> <p>My first ever industry meeting, filled with glorious anticipation, lasted all of five minutes - and went something like this: \"Mark, I read your script. You're a great writer. We can get dozens of writers like you. Get a better concept next time. A high concept.\" A what concept? </p> <p>Let's define terms. </p> <p>Spec script: Something you write on your own impetus that you hope someone will buy. </p> <p>High concept: A story concept that you can describe in 10 words or less (since most studio execs have the attention span of a Halloween pumpkin but aren't nearly as bright). Example: \"I see dead people.\" </p> <p>Producer: An entity (not necessarily human) who makes it possible for your spec script to be purchased by the studios. </p> <p>Studio exec: Another entity (see Producer) who takes your script up the studio's corporate ladder to the people who may ultimately make it into a movie. </p> <p>Here's how it should work. I write a script on spec, a producer receives it from my agent, reads it, loves it and takes it to the studio with which they are affiliated. The studio buys it, makes it into a successful film and continues to pay me obscene amounts of money to write what I like. </p> <p>Now, forget all that and you've got my career. </p> <p>It was 1990. I wasn't all that young but I was fairly naive. I still believed in Santa Claus and reasonable Hollywood men and women. I was taking writing classes at a community college and had finished three scripts, two of which were science fiction. My goal was to bring better science fiction to the big screen. I wasn't having much luck. Seven out of the top 10 grossing films of all time have been sci-fi - you'd think it would be an easy sale. Not so. Any producer who read my work liked the writing and hated the concepts. If it wasn't ET, it wasn't really sci-fi, one producer maintained. </p> <p>Fortunately, one of my rejected science fiction scripts, Nemesis, caught the attention of a company that was looking for new writers (new = non-union = cheaper than Writers' Guild). As a result, the company asked me to be part of a cattle call and pitch a concept for the sequel to Relentless, a low-budget film about a guilt-ridden serial killer who wants to be murdered by the police. The sequel was supposed to be a variation on the original, but it had to be clever enough to catch the attention of the film company, Cinetel, a very successful low-budget company that makes five or six money-producing films a year, year after year, mostly by selling them to cable networks or going direct to video. </p> <p>My idea for Cinetel's sequel: a serial killer who is not a serial killer is killing people who are already dead. </p> <p>They bought it almost instantly. </p> <p>I was contracted to write the script and for what seemed like a lot of money ($38,000 in various increments). They wiggled out of the last $10,000 payment by declaring that they hadn't achieved a certain contractual production goal. Were they lying? Don't know. Did I care? Hell, no. I made $28,000 for three months' work. Do that a few times a year and you're living large. </p> <p>The man who had directed the first Relentless was also going to direct the sequel. I saw him at an Academy awards party hosted by Cinetel. Never having met a director, I was full of the promise of the future, having already mentally bonded with this man, professional to professional. When I introduced myself to this (former porn-video) director, he told me flat-out that the script would never work - this without reading a single word of something that I had barely started. He would give me four films by the famed Italian horror director Dario Argento. I wasn't clear what he wanted me to learn from them, but I was nevertheless supposed to watch them and call him so we could change the script - even though he knew that I was contractually obligated to write only the concept that I had pitched to Cinetel. </p> <p>Despite his intervention, I wrote the story I had pitched. Ultimately, he didn't end up directing the movie. Michael Schroeder, the replacement director, helped polish my script and make it visually stunning. Everyone lived happily ever after, right? </p> <p>That could have happened. </p> <p>The actor, Ray Sharkey (Idol Maker, Wiseguy), who they pulled in at the last minute to play the bad guy, was someone who I respected and admired. The first words out of his mouth were less than reassuring: \"This is some of the worst shit writing I have ever seen. Who fucking talks like this?\" </p> <p>As our relationship progressed from bad to worse, I soon understood why Sharkey was such a convincing bad guy: he was an asshole. He turned the filming of Relentless II into a nightmare of petulant rants. I also learned a hard lesson. In the low-budget world, you only work with actors like Sharkey when they are on the downside of their career. By then, they are usually pretty grumpy fucks who hate the fact that they are doing a $2.5m genre flick instead of a $100m studio film. There are a lot of them. </p> <p><strong>Montage of scenes </strong></p> <p>Cinetel and I proved to be a good match. Around town its creative director, Catalaine Knell, was called the Queen of Bs. I was emerging as the King of Roman Numerals. After Relentless II, Cat and I collaborated on six more films, five of which were sequels. I was so busy at one time that I was working for two companies on three scripts, finishing one, starting another and polishing a third. </p> <p>The movies were fast, fun and financially rewarding. Plus, the B-movie- makers would take chances that studios would never dare. It was hard, sometimes frustrating work, and I was always proud - until I saw the finished product, which most times made me cringe. Most times the movies I wrote made me cringe. There was always an excuse: bad director, alcoholic actors, no budget. But in the back of my mind, I thought maybe I'm just not a very good writer. Still, I had a good time, I made money and I didn't think about the future much. Eventually, I developed a sense of humour and a fatalism about the whole process. How else do you cope with the following experiences . . . </p> <p>I was commissioned to write the fourth in a series of Ghoulies pictures, but (a rather big but) Cinetel couldn't afford the actual Ghoulie puppets. That meant I couldn't use any of the scenery-chewing title characters in the script. Imagine doing Jurassic Park without dinosaurs. (\"Did you see that giant lizard?\" \"Where?\" \"Right there!\" \"Where?\") I actually produced a pretty good script for G4 that was then brutally rewritten by the lead actor and director into the biggest mess I have ever seen - and, unfortunately, my name was the only one to make it to the credits. </p> <p>Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are probably nice, normal guys now (or not). Back in the late 1980s the teen heartthrobs did a few films together, including Dream a Little Dream. Cinetel bought the rights to Dream a Little Dream 2 and asked me for a storyline. At the time, both boys were turning into, shall I say, adventurous young men. I was told by Cinetel to keep one of the Coreys (I don't remember which) \"in jail\" throughout the film because his personal habits were a little wild and Cinetel needed to maintain control over his performances. Then the other Corey got into even more trouble and I was asked to make him the one who had to spend time in jail. Why, exactly, was I working my ass off again? </p> <p>Image Organization, another successful low-budget film house known for doing all the Scanners films, Deep Cover and other slick and professionally crafted B-movies, bought one script from me and hired me to write a sequel. For Scanners: The Showdown, I wrote what I considered a moody, thoughtful science fiction-horror film - my tribute to David Cronenberg, who years before had written and directed the first Scanners, a sci-fi classic. My script was enthusiastically embraced by all the executives at Image except, unfortunately, the man who was paying me. I was told to write an entirely new script in one week or I would be fired. I apparently didn't understand the rules of this sub-genre: each Scanner film (four at last count) must include two heads blowing up. I slammed out a new script in only five days and it was, of course, monstrously inadequate. But it was approved: it featured two exploding heads. </p> <p>Mistress is a funny and sad film about a writer who has to continually rework his film to accommodate a revolving cadre of \"film producers\" who are porking empty-headed and talentless actresses with big tits. I thought it was fiction until I was put into the same position on not one, but four different projects. I don't want to name names here because some of those involved are nice people (and they might sue me). But for example: a film company I worked for purchased one of my scripts specifically to feature the producer's girlfriend, whom he hoped to turn into an action star. To be fair, she did the fighting shit well and was very attractive in all those skintight, cleavage-enhancing outfits. Unfortunately, there were actually portions of the script where she had to, you know, talk. </p> <p>And so on for seven years with dozens of assignments, hundreds of story meetings and 12 produced films. I was getting just a little burned out and beginning to think that I was relegated to writing sub-par, genre scripts that paid the bills but in no way helped move me forward either careerwise or, more important, creatively. </p> <p><strong>Cut to: real-time </strong></p> <p>With my agent's blessing, I took a gamble and stopped taking low-budget assignments to write what I wanted to write. Arachnid was a labour of love - my passionate homage to the creature flicks of the 1950s, the kind of movie where a man/insect/alien grows to epic proportions because of exposure to radiation/virus/convenient substance and takes over whatever town/island/ planet the small-time production company could afford. These movies, like Them! and The Blob, were canonical masterpieces of B-movie-making. I knew, in this revisionist mood of Hollywood, that anything from 40 years ago was being given a new cloak of respectability. Throw enough money at something and you make it legitimate: old television, old movies or old actors. With studio-funding and the right creative urge, Arachnid could be a sci-fi classic. </p> <p>And now, waiting to enter Davis's offices, I was actually on the doorstep of the magic kingdom. After too many years of scraping and bowing, I finally had something that a mega-producer liked and wanted to take to a studio. How many times had I been this close? Actually, not many - but the constant promise of this moment had kept me working hard. Even as my agent had slowly lost some of the enthusiasm we had shared in the earlier days of my career, I never faltered or wavered on my original goal of bringing intelligent sci-fi to the big screen. </p> <p>I had been told in a phone meeting with one of Davis's key development people that Davis Productions intended to make Arachnid its next big summer movie. It was going to budget it at $50m, minimum. That meant hundreds of thousands of dollars for me - financial freedom. Plus, I would have the chance to work with consummately professional actors, directors and producers who understood what I was trying to do. Even more, it was a legitimacy that had so far escaped my career: I was on my way to the writer's A-list, where the Spielbergs and the Lucases played light-sabre tag with adventuresome archaeologists. </p> <p>You already know where this is going, don't you? </p> <p>Davis did take the script to Fox. Before the studio would commit to a production deal (read as: before they would pay me one bloody cent), the exec from Fox wanted changes. Ridiculous, arbitrary changes. Changes as silly as the worst episodes of Star Trek . . . </p> <p>\"Maybe there could be a shape-shifter alien and no one knows who it is.\" Had he seen The Thing? </p> <p>\"Could the girl fall in love with the alien spider?\" I figured that if he could get dates, then a giant, pus-dripping, alien spider could too. </p> <p>\"Maybe the spider gets killed right after they land on the island.\" I had a hard time even responding to this one. Did he know the title of the movie was Arachnid? </p> <p>Maybe Arachnid was never great art, but it did sustain a certain internal logic and delivered on the suspense in every scene. I knew to keep the spider hidden for the majority of the film; keep people wanting to see what's behind that bush, how the spider will kill its victim. I only showed its legs, fangs, hairy armpits - until it was time for the big payoff. I've been reading, watching and studying sci-fi horror for decades; I love writing it. The suggestions (demands) they piled on me wouldn't have passed my 11-year-old niece's bullshit alarm. </p> <p>I struggled for a futile month on synopsis rewrites, all for free, hopelessly trying to find the focus of these ludicrous ideas. The result was reams of vacuous crap that pleased neither me nor anyone at the studio. I was stunned. Where were the creative minds that propelled this movie business? Is the payday the only difference between the idiots at the bottom and the idiots at the top? \"What did you expect?\" my Cinetel friend Catalaine asked me. And maybe I wasn't a very good writer. </p> <p>In the end they - Davis Productions, Fox studios - wouldn't return my phone calls, and all the remaining steam seemed to go out of my agent regarding my once-hot/now-not career. It took longer and longer for David to return my calls. </p> <p>I never heard from him again on a Sunday. </p> <p><strong>Epilogue </strong></p> <p>I call it ESP, Endless Self-Promotion. You learn that no matter who you talk to, or about what subject, you always mention: 1) Your latest project; 2) Your last project; 3) Five ideas for your next project; 4) All of the above - twice. </p> <p>Two years after Fox, having used my ESP, Arachnid ended up in the hands of an independent producer who needed scripts. Brian Yuzna (Re-Animator, The Dentist) had a three-picture deal with a Spanish film company that wanted to break into the American horror market. He pitched Arachnid as one of the 50 scripts that he could get. Those Spanish boys loved it. How can you go wrong with a giant alien spider? Then they read the script and loved it more. We began negotiating. Suddenly they didn't love it as much. In the end, they screwed me and I thanked them for it. I mean, who else is going to give me $45,000 for anything besides one of my kidneys? </p> <p>I was actually happy at this turn of events. Even if Arachnid wasn't going to a studio, it was going to a group of people who had some low-budget chops. The producers, Sheri Bryant and Yuzna, are well known and well thought of in the horror world - the director they hired, Jack Sholder, equally so. The company that would do the spider effects and mockups, Steve Johnson's XFX, is one of the best in the world. Had I somehow slipped out of Fox, into a bucket of shit and come out smelling, well, if not like a rose then perhaps like one of those pine tree things you hang on your car mirror? </p> <p>As of this writing, Arachnid is well into post-production, which means it has been filmed and it is in the editing room being cut together. Is it, will it be, any good? Last I heard, the actors, competent professionals who no one was screwing on the side, did a good job. The Spanish film company had even at one point grudgingly approved some extra money. The spider puppets and animatronics had performed as promised. </p> <p>All good signs. </p> <p>Unfortunately, one of the producers has also recently informed me that the director is missing shots. This happens occasionally in the mad rush of a low- budget shoot, and most times it's nothing to panic about - unless the missing scenes happen in the climax of the film and they feature (or don't feature, actually) the star of the movie, the king-size spider. </p> <p>I don't know if the producers are willing to invest the money to fix the problem or if it's even possible at this late stage - all the sets were struck. Maybe spooky hand shadows will take the place of the alien arachnid in the missing scenes. </p> <p>\"Did you see that giant fucking spider?\" </p> <p>\"Where?\" </p> <p>\"Right there!\" </p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\">salon.com</a>.

Example: \"I see dead people.\" Producer: An entity (not necessarily human) who makes it possible for your spec script to be purchased by the studios. Studio exec: Another entity (see Producer) who takes your script up the studio's corporate ladder to the people who may ultimately make it into a movie. Here's how it should work. I write a script on spec, a producer receives it from my agent, reads it, loves it and takes it to the studio with which they are affiliated. The studio buys it, makes it into a successful film and continues to pay me obscene amounts of money to write what I like. Now, forget all that and you've got my career. It was 1990. I wasn't all that young but I was fairly naive. I still believed in Santa Claus and reasonable Hollywood men and women. I was taking writing classes at a community college and had finished three scripts, two of which were science fiction. My goal was to bring better science fiction to the big screen. I wasn't having much luck. Seven out of the top 10 grossing films of all time have been sci-fi - you'd think it would be an easy sale. Not so. Any producer who read my work liked the writing and hated the concepts. If it wasn't ET, it wasn't really sci-fi, one producer maintained. Fortunately, one of my rejected science fiction scripts, Nemesis, caught the attention of a company that was looking for new writers (new = non-union = cheaper than Writers' Guild). As a result, the company asked me to be part of a cattle call and pitch a concept for the sequel to Relentless, a low-budget film about a guilt-ridden serial killer who wants to be murdered by the police. The sequel was supposed to be a variation on the original, but it had to be clever enough to catch the attention of the film company, Cinetel, a very successful low-budget company that makes five or six money-producing films a year, year after year, mostly by selling them to cable networks or going direct to video. My idea for Cinetel's sequel: a serial killer who is not a serial killer is killing people who are already dead. They bought it almost instantly. I was contracted to write the script and for what seemed like a lot of money ($38,000 in various increments). They wiggled out of the last $10,000 payment by declaring that they hadn't achieved a certain contractual production goal. Were they lying? Don't know. Did I care? Hell, no. I made $28,000 for three months' work. Do that a few times a year and you're living large. The man who had directed the first Relentless was also going to direct the sequel. I saw him at an Academy awards party hosted by Cinetel. Never having met a director, I was full of the promise of the future, having already mentally bonded with this man, professional to professional. When I introduced myself to this (former porn-video) director, he told me flat-out that the script would never work - this without reading a single word of something that I had barely started. He would give me four films by the famed Italian horror director Dario Argento. I wasn't clear what he wanted me to learn from them, but I was nevertheless supposed to watch them and call him so we could change the script - even though he knew that I was contractually obligated to write only the concept that I had pitched to Cinetel. Despite his intervention, I wrote the story I had pitched. Ultimately, he didn't end up directing the movie. Michael Schroeder, the replacement director, helped polish my script and make it visually stunning. Everyone lived happily ever after, right? That could have happened. The actor, Ray Sharkey (Idol Maker, Wiseguy), who they pulled in at the last minute to play the bad guy, was someone who I respected and admired. The first words out of his mouth were less than reassuring: \"This is some of the worst shit writing I have ever seen. Who fucking talks like this?\" As our relationship progressed from bad to worse, I soon understood why Sharkey was such a convincing bad guy: he was an asshole. He turned the filming of Relentless II into a nightmare of petulant rants. I also learned a hard lesson. In the low-budget world, you only work with actors like Sharkey when they are on the downside of their career. By then, they are usually pretty grumpy fucks who hate the fact that they are doing a $2.5m genre flick instead of a $100m studio film. There are a lot of them. Montage of scenes Cinetel and I proved to be a good match. Around town its creative director, Catalaine Knell, was called the Queen of Bs. I was emerging as the King of Roman Numerals. After Relentless II, Cat and I collaborated on six more films, five of which were sequels. I was so busy at one time that I was working for two companies on three scripts, finishing one, starting another and polishing a third. The movies were fast, fun and financially rewarding. Plus, the B-movie- makers would take chances that studios would never dare. It was hard, sometimes frustrating work, and I was always proud - until I saw the finished product, which most times made me cringe. Most times the movies I wrote made me cringe. There was always an excuse: bad director, alcoholic actors, no budget. But in the back of my mind, I thought maybe I'm just not a very good writer. Still, I had a good time, I made money and I didn't think about the future much. Eventually, I developed a sense of humour and a fatalism about the whole process. How else do you cope with the following experiences . . . I was commissioned to write the fourth in a series of Ghoulies pictures, but (a rather big but) Cinetel couldn't afford the actual Ghoulie puppets. That meant I couldn't use any of the scenery-chewing title characters in the script. Imagine doing Jurassic Park without dinosaurs. (\"Did you see that giant lizard?\" \"Where?\" \"Right there!\" \"Where?\") I actually produced a pretty good script for G4 that was then brutally rewritten by the lead actor and director into the biggest mess I have ever seen - and, unfortunately, my name was the only one to make it to the credits. Corey Haim and Corey Feldman are probably nice, normal guys now (or not). Back in the late 1980s the teen heartthrobs did a few films together, including Dream a Little Dream. Cinetel bought the rights to Dream a Little Dream 2 and asked me for a storyline. At the time, both boys were turning into, shall I say, adventurous young men. I was told by Cinetel to keep one of the Coreys (I don't remember which) \"in jail\" throughout the film because his personal habits were a little wild and Cinetel needed to maintain control over his performances. Then the other Corey got into even more trouble and I was asked to make him the one who had to spend time in jail. Why, exactly, was I working my ass off again? Image Organization, another successful low-budget film house known for doing all the Scanners films, Deep Cover and other slick and professionally crafted B-movies, bought one script from me and hired me to write a sequel. For Scanners: The Showdown, I wrote what I considered a moody, thoughtful science fiction-horror film - my tribute to David Cronenberg, who years before had written and directed the first Scanners, a sci-fi classic. My script was enthusiastically embraced by all the executives at Image except, unfortunately, the man who was paying me. I was told to write an entirely new script in one week or I would be fired. I apparently didn't understand the rules of this sub-genre: each Scanner film (four at last count) must include two heads blowing up. I slammed out a new script in only five days and it was, of course, monstrously inadequate. But it was approved: it featured two exploding heads. Mistress is a funny and sad film about a writer who has to continually rework his film to accommodate a revolving cadre of \"film producers\" who are porking empty-headed and talentless actresses with big tits. I thought it was fiction until I was put into the same position on not one, but four different projects. I don't want to name names here because some of those involved are nice people (and they might sue me). But for example: a film company I worked for purchased one of my scripts specifically to feature the producer's girlfriend, whom he hoped to turn into an action star. To be fair, she did the fighting shit well and was very attractive in all those skintight, cleavage-enhancing outfits. Unfortunately, there were actually portions of the script where she had to, you know, talk. And so on for seven years with dozens of assignments, hundreds of story meetings and 12 produced films. I was getting just a little burned out and beginning to think that I was relegated to writing sub-par, genre scripts that paid the bills but in no way helped move me forward either careerwise or, more important, creatively. Cut to: real-time With my agent's blessing, I took a gamble and stopped taking low-budget assignments to write what I wanted to write. Arachnid was a labour of love - my passionate homage to the creature flicks of the 1950s, the kind of movie where a man/insect/alien grows to epic proportions because of exposure to radiation/virus/convenient substance and takes over whatever town/island/ planet the small-time production company could afford. These movies, like Them! and The Blob, were canonical masterpieces of B-movie-making. I knew, in this revisionist mood of Hollywood, that anything from 40 years ago was being given a new cloak of respectability. Throw enough money at something and you make it legitimate: old television, old movies or old actors. With studio-funding and the right creative urge, Arachnid could be a sci-fi classic. And now, waiting to enter Davis's offices, I was actually on the doorstep of the magic kingdom. After too many years of scraping and bowing, I finally had something that a mega-producer liked and wanted to take to a studio. How many times had I been this close? Actually, not many - but the constant promise of this moment had kept me working hard. Even as my agent had slowly lost some of the enthusiasm we had shared in the earlier days of my career, I never faltered or wavered on my original goal of bringing intelligent sci-fi to the big screen. I had been told in a phone meeting with one of Davis's key development people that Davis Productions intended to make Arachnid its next big summer movie. It was going to budget it at $50m, minimum. That meant hundreds of thousands of dollars for me - financial freedom. Plus, I would have the chance to work with consummately professional actors, directors and producers who understood what I was trying to do. Even more, it was a legitimacy that had so far escaped my career: I was on my way to the writer's A-list, where the Spielbergs and the Lucases played light-sabre tag with adventuresome archaeologists. You already know where this is going, don't you? Davis did take the script to Fox. Before the studio would commit to a production deal (read as: before they would pay me one bloody cent), the exec from Fox wanted changes. Ridiculous, arbitrary changes. Changes as silly as the worst episodes of Star Trek . . . \"Maybe there could be a shape-shifter alien and no one knows who it is.\" Had he seen The Thing? \"Could the girl fall in love with the alien spider?\" I figured that if he could get dates, then a giant, pus-dripping, alien spider could too. \"Maybe the spider gets killed right after they land on the island.\" I had a hard time even responding to this one. Did he know the title of the movie was Arachnid? Maybe Arachnid was never great art, but it did sustain a certain internal logic and delivered on the suspense in every scene. I knew to keep the spider hidden for the majority of the film; keep people wanting to see what's behind that bush, how the spider will kill its victim. I only showed its legs, fangs, hairy armpits - until it was time for the big payoff. I've been reading, watching and studying sci-fi horror for decades; I love writing it. The suggestions (demands) they piled on me wouldn't have passed my 11-year-old niece's bullshit alarm. I struggled for a futile month on synopsis rewrites, all for free, hopelessly trying to find the focus of these ludicrous ideas. The result was reams of vacuous crap that pleased neither me nor anyone at the studio. I was stunned. Where were the creative minds that propelled this movie business? Is the payday the only difference between the idiots at the bottom and the idiots at the top? \"What did you expect?\" my Cinetel friend Catalaine asked me. And maybe I wasn't a very good writer. In the end they - Davis Productions, Fox studios - wouldn't return my phone calls, and all the remaining steam seemed to go out of my agent regarding my once-hot/now-not career. It took longer and longer for David to return my calls. I never heard from him again on a Sunday. Epilogue I call it ESP, Endless Self-Promotion. You learn that no matter who you talk to, or about what subject, you always mention: 1) Your latest project; 2) Your last project; 3) Five ideas for your next project; 4) All of the above - twice. Two years after Fox, having used my ESP, Arachnid ended up in the hands of an independent producer who needed scripts. Brian Yuzna (Re-Animator, The Dentist) had a three-picture deal with a Spanish film company that wanted to break into the American horror market. He pitched Arachnid as one of the 50 scripts that he could get. Those Spanish boys loved it. How can you go wrong with a giant alien spider? Then they read the script and loved it more. We began negotiating. Suddenly they didn't love it as much. In the end, they screwed me and I thanked them for it. I mean, who else is going to give me $45,000 for anything besides one of my kidneys? I was actually happy at this turn of events. Even if Arachnid wasn't going to a studio, it was going to a group of people who had some low-budget chops. The producers, Sheri Bryant and Yuzna, are well known and well thought of in the horror world - the director they hired, Jack Sholder, equally so. The company that would do the spider effects and mockups, Steve Johnson's XFX, is one of the best in the world. Had I somehow slipped out of Fox, into a bucket of shit and come out smelling, well, if not like a rose then perhaps like one of those pine tree things you hang on your car mirror? As of this writing, Arachnid is well into post-production, which means it has been filmed and it is in the editing room being cut together. Is it, will it be, any good? Last I heard, the actors, competent professionals who no one was screwing on the side, did a good job. The Spanish film company had even at one point grudgingly approved some extra money. The spider puppets and animatronics had performed as promised. All good signs. Unfortunately, one of the producers has also recently informed me that the director is missing shots. This happens occasionally in the mad rush of a low- budget shoot, and most times it's nothing to panic about - unless the missing scenes happen in the climax of the film and they feature (or don't feature, actually) the star of the movie, the king-size spider. I don't know if the producers are willing to invest the money to fix the problem or if it's even possible at this late stage - all the sets were struck. Maybe spooky hand shadows will take the place of the alien arachnid in the missing scenes. \"Did you see that giant fucking spider?\" \"Where?\" \"Right there!\" \u00a9 salon.com.

Toback's aim seems to be to slam together a mixed bag of white actors - Robert Downey Jr, Ben Stiller and Brooke Shields among them - and black rappers such as Power and Raekwon, mix up the sexual preferences and provocative plotlines and see what transpires. Amid the loose plot strands, the key development sees the ever-impressive Stiller entrap a young black basketball player into throwing a match for $50,000 for motives that turn out to be very twisted. </p> <p>The subtext seems to be whites exploiting blacks and getting away with it because society's set up that way. Black and White is best-known for the scene in which Downey, playing a gay film director comes on to Mike Tyson: \"It's just that in the dream, you were holding me . . .\" It's typical of writer- director-gambler Toback and the ultimate risk-taker Downey that this development in a largely improvised enterprise clearly comes as a surprise to the ex-champ, playing himself. Seconds out.

      "bodyText": "Black and White Rental and DVD rental Columbia Tristar Cert 18 James Toback's view of life on both sides of the racial divide and the inbetweenies - white kids apeing black hip-hop culture - is ragged but always interesting. Toback's aim seems to be to slam together a mixed bag of white actors - Robert Downey Jr, Ben Stiller and Brooke Shields among them - and black rappers such as Power and Raekwon, mix up the sexual preferences and provocative plotlines and see what transpires. Amid the loose plot strands, the key development sees the ever-impressive Stiller entrap a young black basketball player into throwing a match for $50,000 for motives that turn out to be very twisted. The subtext seems to be whites exploiting blacks and getting away with it because society's set up that way. Black and White is best-known for the scene in which Downey, playing a gay film director comes on to Mike Tyson: \"It's just that in the dream, you were holding me . . .\" It's typical of writer- director-gambler Toback and the ultimate risk-taker Downey that this development in a largely improvised enterprise clearly comes as a surprise to the ex-champ, playing himself.

To top it all off, he has just met the person he jilted when she was a schoolgirl 30 years before: now a beautiful and elegant woman who, in a blaze of passion, reveals that her teenage angst and vulnerability are still as fresh as a daisy and demands to know why he left her all those years ago. </p> <p>A One and a Two's literary quality resides in the easy yet thoughtful way Yang manages all the narrative strands, while having the confidence to go off on tangents and intriguing byways.

The karmic oneness of the universe divided in two, maybe? The paradox of two lovers and one love? No - all it means is how jazz musicians count themselves in for a live number: it's a happy introduction to the laid-back ensemble style of which Yang shows such mastery, and which acts as a solvent to the intensity, and occasionally the melodrama that his movie acts out. </p> <p>It starts at a raucous, rowdy wedding reception: that of the corpulent, giggling A-Di (Hsi-Sheng Chen) and the heavily pregnant Xiao Yan (Shu-shen Hsiao). The event is immediately poisoned by the sudden, hysterical appearance of the groom's old girlfriend Yun-Yun (Hsin-Yi Tseng), who behaves like the spectre at the feast. Her calculated malice is of a piece with her unwelcome arrival some months later at a small party to celebrate the birth of Xiao Yan's baby, which she appraises with cool detachment before saying sweetly, \"It looks more like the mother than the father!\" - a deliciously subtle, vicious stab at Xiao Yan's sexual continence. </p> <p>It's all part of the headache for NJ, who is thunderstruck by an accidental meeting at the hotel where the reception is taking place with Sherry (Su-Yun Ko), his first love and, as he and we are to realise in the course of the film, very probably his only love. They exchange halting pleasantries, laden with a Brief Encounters poignancy, and Sherry walks away. Then she turns on her heel, comes back, and demands to know why NJ stood her up for what was to be their final, non-existent date.

It is a feat of storytelling which is carried off with tremendous poise and unobtrusive artistic integrity. </p> <p>When people talk about today's new golden age of \"arthouse cinema\", this is the kind of film they mean, and Edward Yang is the kind of director they mean - although confining A One and a Two to the ghetto of \"arthouse\" is obtuse.

The letter was discussed by the Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, and the US ambassador, Joseph Prueher, in Beijing, and later by Mr Powell's deputy Richard Armitage at two meetings with the Chinese ambassador, Yang Jiechi, in Washington. \"We remain in a sensitive stage of those negotiations... and that is where matters stand,\" Mr Fleischer said. Both sides seem committed to finding a diplomatic solution, and the White House went out of its way to say that it wanted congressional groups to go ahead with planned visits to China, starting this weekend. The tone of Washington's comments became less confrontational, officials who had previously said they were frustrated by the lack of progress saying that things looked brighter. Mr Powell, who was celebrating his 64th birthday, told reporters that he was up at 2.30am yesterday, \"with a little situation we have going on with China.\" A commentary in the official English-language newspaper China Daily began with the conciliatory observation: \"apparently neither Beijing nor Washington wants to see a full-blown crisis.\" It ending by stressing China's \"legitimate request for an apology, compensation and explanation\".

The computer modelling work depends on the disease having started at Heddon on the Wall farm in February. But the book is not closed on this and army sources confirmed this week that this theory is still being investigated. There is accumulating evidence that foot and mouth was in sheep prior to this, and there was more disease in the population than originally thought.</p> <p>If so, then much changes. Instead of Imperial College's steep initial rise and predicted fall off, the curve of outbreaks would be much flatter to start with, the build up would be slower and the effects would last longer. We may be nowhere near the peak in some areas.</p> <p>There may well also have been massive under-reporting of outbreaks, which again would skew the epidemiologists' data. Hundreds of thousands of animals are being killed for no more reason than they are on farms adjoining ones where disease has been confirmed, or be cause they are within three kilometres of an outbreak. But we have no idea how many of these sheep have actually been infected because no one is testing them before slaughter. Again, the government may not be getting a true picture of the epidemic.</p> <p>Moreover, foot and mouth passes through sheep very quickly and relatively mildly. It is hard even for an experienced shepherd or vet to spot. It is likely that many animals were infected some time ago but have since recovered and now show no signs of the disease. Because no one is testing what appear to be \"healthy\" animals we may never know how far it has been. The government does not have the resources to start random blood testing to see if animals have developed antibodies after contracting the disease.</p> <p>But it matters because to get back its foot and mouth-free status, it will have to embark on an aggressive monitoring programme to test whether any animals still have the disease or have foot and mouth antibodies in their blood. But if any are missed then we could have the disease for years because these animals will be regarded as carriers. Theoretically the disease could re-emerge again and again.</p> <p>It is possible, say some epidemiologists, that foot and mouth may have gone so far into the national flock that it is now effectively endemic. If this is the case, then it will be strongly argued that had we vaccinated or just let the disease run, we would have avoided the costs, the misery, the inconvenience and associated economic hardship and would not have lost our exports for any longer.</p> <p>Tony Blair's best bet is that the army and the veterinarians, hauliers, slaughterers and others get on top of the crisis. The official optimism suggesting that the disease will almost run itself out by June, is based on there being fast identification, quick slaughter and speedy disposal of the carcasses.</p> <p>But the reality is that, even with 1,700 army and more than 1,000 vets, the operation in key areas is faulty, slow and behind schedule.</p> <p>The chart shows that until the Ministry of Agriculture's website was censored on Monday, the backlog of animals to be slaughtered was rising rapidly, as were the numbers of carcasses waiting to be disposed of. On Tuesday, a record 192,000 carcasses were waiting to be buried, and 379,000 animals were still waiting to be killed (another record). Yesterday, Maff admitted that it had reached 392,000. Meanwhile, the number of animals being killed was outstripping the numbers being buried. It would have been hard for any politician to be optimistic.</p> <p>But there are new and worrying trends. Although there have been fewer cases this week, the disease is jumping about unexpectedly and across long distances. New areas are being infected and it is deepening in other s. There is evidence that Maff is in some areas prioritising cattle farmers instead of sheep farmers because they consider cows more economically valuable.</p> <p>According to one army officer in the north-east, foot and mouth is rampant on the high fells but it is no longer a government priority. This has been denied but the situation in Cumbria and Northumberland, Powys and Shropshire is on a knife-edge.</p> <p>But we do not know for certain because the government has stopped briefing specialists and allowing access to the chief vet or others. The government's chief scientist's analysis fits happily with government and NFU policy to avoid vaccination and return to exports faster. But local vets argue that a no slaughter policy may mean sacrificing great areas in the Pennines and Cumbria.</p> <p>The policy now is not to cull across the open moors but to trust that the sheep do not move about too much. It is a gamble with a whole farming system.</p> <p>It is also an economic gamble. British meat exports are worth about \u00a340m a year and this epidemic is expected to cost billions of pounds. Every billion pounds it costs is at least two years of exports, perhaps more if the world rejects British meat when this is over.

      "body": "<p>George Bush's nominee for the post of US ambassador to the United Nations concealed from Congress human rights abuses in central America that were carried out by death squads trained and armed by the CIA.</p> <p>John Negroponte, Mr Bush's choice for the UN job, and Otto Reich, who has been named by the president to a senior Latin American post, were also both closely linked with the illegal contra war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.</p> <p>Their nomination has dismayed human rights activists in the US and Latin America. Critics hope that previously secret information about their former roles may emerge as the battle against the appointments begins.</p> <p>Mr Negroponte was US ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985 and as such was in a key position to assist in the war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and rebels in El Salvador. At the time, Honduras was known as \"USS Honduras\", such was its position as a base for attacks against leftwing groups.</p> <p>The CIA helped to train an organisation called Battalion 3-16, which carried out the torture and \"disappearing\" of 184 people in Honduras deemed to be politically suspect or communist sympathisers. Until recently, some members of the battalion had been living in the US, but were deported just as Mr Bush's selection of Mr Negroponte was announced. Now one of the battalion members is threatening to blow the whistle on US involvement in training the death squads.</p> <p>General Discua Elvir, a founder of the battalion, who has been deported to Honduras from Miami, appeared on television in Honduras and told the local newspaper La Prensa that he was brought to the US to coordinate the battalion with the contras.</p> <p>The rightwing contras were illegally funded by arms sales to Iran. One of George Bush senior's parting acts as president in 1992 was to pardon those implicated, thus ending the possibility of the full exposure of his and the Reagan administration's involvement.</p> <p>Mr Negroponte's predecessor in Honduras, Jack Binns, was replaced after alerting Washington about extra-judicial executions by the Honduran authorities. Mr Binns has now told In These Times magazine: \"Negroponte would have had to be deliberately blind not to know about human rights violations...

      "bodyText": "George Bush's nominee for the post of US ambassador to the United Nations concealed from Congress human rights abuses in central America that were carried out by death squads trained and armed by the CIA. John Negroponte, Mr Bush's choice for the UN job, and Otto Reich, who has been named by the president to a senior Latin American post, were also both closely linked with the illegal contra war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Their nomination has dismayed human rights activists in the US and Latin America. Critics hope that previously secret information about their former roles may emerge as the battle against the appointments begins. Mr Negroponte was US ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985 and as such was in a key position to assist in the war against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua and rebels in El Salvador. At the time, Honduras was known as \"USS Honduras\", such was its position as a base for attacks against leftwing groups. The CIA helped to train an organisation called Battalion 3-16, which carried out the torture and \"disappearing\" of 184 people in Honduras deemed to be politically suspect or communist sympathisers. Until recently, some members of the battalion had been living in the US, but were deported just as Mr Bush's selection of Mr Negroponte was announced. Now one of the battalion members is threatening to blow the whistle on US involvement in training the death squads. General Discua Elvir, a founder of the battalion, who has been deported to Honduras from Miami, appeared on television in Honduras and told the local newspaper La Prensa that he was brought to the US to coordinate the battalion with the contras. The rightwing contras were illegally funded by arms sales to Iran. One of George Bush senior's parting acts as president in 1992 was to pardon those implicated, thus ending the possibility of the full exposure of his and the Reagan administration's involvement. Mr Negroponte's predecessor in Honduras, Jack Binns, was replaced after alerting Washington about extra-judicial executions by the Honduran authorities. Mr Binns has now told In These Times magazine: \"Negroponte would have had to be deliberately blind not to know about human rights violations... One of the things a departing ambassador does is prepare a briefing book, and one of those issues we included [in the briefing book] was how to deal with the escalation of human rights issues.\" \"It's very troubling\", Reed Brody, of Human Rights Watch in New York, said yesterday. \"When John Negroponte was ambassador he looked the other way when serious atrocities were committed. One would have to wonder what kind of message the Bush administration is sending about human rights by this appointment.\" Mr Negroponte is said to be the specific choice of Colin Powell, the secretary of state. An ex-Honduran congressman, Efrain Diaz, told the Baltimore Sun which investigated US involvement in the region in 1995: \"Their attitude [Mr Negroponte and other senior US officials] was one of tolerance and silence. They needed Honduras to loan its territory more than they were concerned about innocent people being killed.\" On several occasions, Mr Negroponte also met Colonel Oliver North, who coordinated support for the contras within the White House. The Sun's investigation found that the CIA and US embassy knew of numerous abuses but continued to support Battalion 3-16 and ensured that the embassy's annual human rights report did not contain the full story. Mr Negroponte, who retired from government service in 1997, has claimed that when abuses were brought to his attention he took action. Mr Bush has also nominated another figure from the Iran-contra era as assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere affairs. Cuban-born Otto Reich headed the state department's now defunct office of public diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean between 1983 and 1986. It was accused of engaging in illegal propaganda activities to promote the Reagan administration's policies in support of the contras.",

      "body": "<p>I've had another bad night. I was woken at 3.30am by a stench of smoke and dead animals. I leapt out of bed and shut the window, but the pungent reminder of what is going on outside lingered in the bedroom.</p> <p>The nearest burning pyre is several miles from here, but one is due to be lit at Whiteside Law, just a mile away, soon. This farm had a case of foot and mouth confirmed at 5pm on Sunday, and at the time of writing this fact has not appeared on the Maff website. How many more cases are there like that out there? And is it a deliberate policy, or just more of the ministry's ineptitude?</p> <p>At 7am I heard Malcolm Corbett, a farmer from Otterburn and our county National Farmers Union chairman, on Radio 4. He was deploring the state of affairs in Northumberland. He said that all the resources have gone to Cumbria and things are getting worse in our county. I agree with him entirely.</p> <p>I've received so many telephone calls in the past week complaining about Maff's inability to either make a decision at all, or make one that isn't changed twice within five minutes - especially at the Kenton Bar headquarters in Newcastle. I really believe the farmers, with the help of the vets and the army, could do a better job. We have all had enough and if the shilly-shallying continues much longer I think there will be a mass uprising and the farmers will refuse to co-operate.</p> <p>Willie Woodman, who farms on Hadrian's Wall, has just rung. His farm runs alongside a confirmed case and he heard nothing from Maff until two days ago. He received a phone call almost 14 days after his neighbour's flock was confirmed, telling him his stock would probably be taken.</p> <p>He heard nothing for 24 hours, and was then told that a decision would be made in the next 24 to 48 hours. Willie says that when they finally do ring, he will tell them he is going to take 48 hours to decide whether to co-operate or not, and see how they like it.</p> <p>Willie also heard that the staff working on the Maff helplines are receiving counselling. But what about the farmers and their families? He's always been a calm man and a good livestock farmer, but this is sending him round the twist.</p> <p>Peter and I watched the news with disbelief as the government claimed it was on top of the cases and killing was being carried out promptly. Not here it isn't, and not on the adjacent farms either - or what we'd call the adjacent farms. Maff has great difficulty in deciding what is a \"contiguous\" - and therefore endangered - farm. The Oxford dictionary defines contiguous as: \"touching, especially along a line, or in contact\". For farmers it is even simpler: if there is stock in the next field along the farm boundary, that is a risk. But if there is an empty field, a road or a wood in between the boundaries, then it may not be. It is common sense to us, but when did a government department ever have that?</p> <p>David and Ursula Martell farm alongside the A68 near the county boundary. David has just received a knitted jumper from Canada, and more sweaters are believed to be on the way. This unexpected and heartwarming surprise came about because another friend of ours, Victoria Robertson, runs a knitwear business, selling hardwearing socks. She had been chatting on the internet to other knitters and mentioned the plight of her friends who had lost all their animals. Ursula suspects that the kind knitters thought the farmers had lost everything, not just the livestock.</p> <p>John Brown is recovering from the ordeal of having his cattle and sheep slaughtered. He actually thought the slaughterman did as good a job as possible in the circumstances, killing 260 cows on John's and his neighbour's farm on Monday without a hitch. John's hay and straw must now be burned on site. It cannot be taken for use on the pyres as it is classed as infected - although John's farm is classed as DC (dangerous contact) and not a confirmed case.</p> <p>His next worst task is to dip and fully disinfect the 3,000 rubber tyres that cover the top of the silage pit. I forgot to tell him that Tigger ran away down the road yesterday, stopping only to roll in the mud and the straw disinfectant barrier. I had to bath her with the nicest smelling shampoo we could find.</p> <p>\u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall.

      "body": "<b>Cachoeirinha, Brazil: a vote of confidence</b> <br> <b>Alex Bellos</b> <p>When Brazilian footballer Ronaldo and his wife Milene were choosing a name for their child they wanted something that sounded like the father's name but was a little different. \"We chose Ronald,\" says Milene, \"It fitted perfectly. And also, Ronaldo and I love eating at McDonald's.\" </p> <p>Since Ronald McDonald arrived in Brazil 22 years ago he has made a big impression on Latin America's largest nation. Brazil has 554 McDonald's restaurants, a similar amount of McDonald's ice-cream kiosks (the number varies according to the season), and the total is growing at a rate of 70 restaurants and 50 kiosks a year. </p> <p>Tomorrow, a Drive-Thru outlet is due to open in Cachoeirinha, a satellite town of Porto Alegre in the south of the country. It is part of the second wave of McDonald's' expansion in Brazil. The first was to the main cities. The second is a push inland. </p> <p>A big party has been arranged that will include musical performances with gaucho men and women in regional dress and, less traditionally, a belly-dancer. The local priest, Father Dionisio Kemper, will bless the establishment. Four hundred customised metal badges have been ordered to share between the employees and special guests. </p> <p>\"Even though McDonald's is a multinational,\" says Shioji Honda, the 29-year-old manager, \"people see it as a local company. It helps the whole community, with local labour and jobs. It unites the community.\" </p> <p>A week ago there was nothing at the site along Cachoeirinha's main street where McDonald's now stands. Then the prefab building with cream walls and a blue roof was delivered and put up in 72 hours. The highest point visible in the town is a 16m pole supporting a pair of golden arches; one more town colonised by the Big Mac. </p> <p>Honda interviewed more than 350 young people for the 53 jobs. \"Everyone wants to work at McDonald's,\" he adds. McDonald's is well-known for not insisting on previous experience and is an established route into the workplace for tens of thousands of young Brazilians. About two thirds of McDonald's' 36,000 employees started their working lives there. Almost 90% are under 21. </p> <p>When the branch opens it will be the first job for M\u00e1rcia de Oliveira Trinidade, aged 18. \"My friend worked in a McDonald's in a shopping centre, she said I should do it. She said it's a really good place to work. Most of the others are my age, it's a good atmosphere.\" </p> <p>M\u00e1rcia's starting salary is \u00a336 a month for a four-hour day, which works out at less than 45p an hour. It doesn't sound like much but the national minimum wage is \u00a349 for twice as many hours. Many entire families survive - albeit in abject misery - on the minimum wage. A Big Mac costs \u00a31.16, meaning that M\u00e1rcia has to work more than three hours to be able to afford one. </p> <p>Brazilian McDonald's uses exclusively Brazilian ingredients and has developed its own products, such as passion fruit juice, banana tart and guava sauce for ice cream. Brazilians have also embraced the Americanisms, abbreviating a Big Mac to a \"Big\" and introducing terms such as McDuplo, McMilla and McOferta. Quarter Pounder has been officially adapted to the nearest word, Quarterao - a bizarre choice since its literal meaning is a person with a quarter black blood. </p> <p>Brazil is the world's largest Catholic country, and over Easter the Cachoeirinha branch will - like the others in the chain - be promoting its line of McFish. Even so, Father Dionisio says he has no intention of staying on after his blessing. </p> <p>Brazil is no stranger to anti-imperialist sentiment. The area around Porto Alegre, in fact, was the focus for violent protests against biochemical giant Monsanto's genetically modified soya seeds this year. Yet McDonald's has not attracted the same anti-globilisation resentment. </p> <p>The widespread poverty and unfair distribution of wealth in Brazil has meant that the decision to open a McDonald's store in the town is seen as a welcome vote of confidence. Edir Oliveira, a local leftwing councillor in Cachoeirinha, said he was proud that the chain was coming to Cachoeirinha. \"There is lots of unemployment here. The more work that comes the better.\" </p> <p>Before each McDonald's opens, there is usually a family night, in which parents of the employees are asked to attend the restaurant and be served a meal by their children. \"This is very emotional. In Brazil most first jobs are part of the informal economy. It's important for a mother to see that her daughter has an honest job,\" says Ayrton Kanitz, a McDonald's spokesperson. </p> <p>The growth of McDonald's in Brazil has been in parallel with the fate of the currency, which after years of hyperinflation is now stable. The effect was to give the poorer sectors of society more disposable income. </p> <p>This is perhaps best seen in a favela shantytown in Rio de Janeiro, which this year became the first in Brazil to have its own branch of McDonald's. As well as demonstrating the urbanisation of slum areas, it shows that McDonald's is the multinational best-placed to step in where others fear to tread. </p> <p>The favela branch does so well that it does equivalent business to the kiosk at the glitzy Barra shopping mall three miles away, which is frequented by the richest sector of Rio's population. </p> <p>In Porto Alegre, where Carlos Henrique Silva Alvares looks after seven outlets, he has seen a move from McDonald's opening in shopping centres to less heavily urban areas like Cachoeirinha. \"The Drive-Thru is an evolution. Before, cars were a luxury. Now they are a necessity.\" </p> <p>The McDonald's identikit Drive-Thru restaurants may look plastic and ugly, yet they can hardly be said to disfigure places such as Cachoeirinha, which are often randomly planned and an untidy mess of odd-sized buildings anyway. Cachoeirinha is only 35 years old, making it younger than McDonald's itself. </p> <p>One McDonald's promotion that has gone down especially well in Brazil are the McHappy Days, in which Big Mac sales are donated to cancer charities. In a McHappy Day last year 5.3m Big Macs were sold - making the Brazilian McHappy Day the most successful in the world. \"Brazilians really go in for this type of solidarity,\" said Honda. </p> <p><b>Maryland, US: still hungry for more</b><br><b>Julian Borger</b></p> <p>It is hard to imagine anything less noteworthy than the appearance of a new McDonald's franchise in Solomons, Maryland. The construction of the red-roofed white box alongside its rival and twin, Burger King, completes the normal landscape of contemporary America. Its absence is more cause for comment than its presence. </p> <p>The Solomons McDonald's near the end of a peninsular jutting out into Chesapeake Bay, is the 12,900th in the US, approximately (McDonald's head office is not entirely sure of the exact figure). Yet the market is clearly not yet saturated. Forty six years after its founding, the fast-food chain is still growing in its home country. In a crowded and competitive market, amid changing consumer tastes and trends, 175 new branches in the US last year. According to a new book about the fast food industry, more American schoolchildren can identify the McDonald's golden arches than can recognise the Christian crucifix. </p> <p>The country's newest McDonald's is set at one end of a strip mall, a line of generic shops that give the US highways their uniform appearance. Preparations were underway up to the last hour before the ritual blessing from Ronald McDonald, the company's ever-smiling mascot. This will be one of three actors who inhabit Ronald's form at any one time across the country, who appear at outlets and hospital wards where they trigger ecstasy among small children. Before Ronald's coming, there is much to be done. Inside the restaurant, the staff are sampling the french fries while county inspectors ensure that hygiene standards are met. Outside, a crew of landscape artists are on their hands and knees ensuring the plot conforms to a rigid set of rules governing how many bushes and how much lawn should surround each restaurant. </p> <p>Steve Bugge, the crew foreman, said his firm maintains 150 such McDonald's gardens in the Virginia and Maryland region with occasional flashes of individualism; a myrtle tree here or a yew bush there, but essentially, Mr Bugge says, \"they are all the same blueprint\". </p> <p>He has been landscaping McDonald's outlets for 19 years, and each year, he insists, \"they get a little bit better, a little more responsive to the consumer\". </p> <p>The Solomons restaurant does indeed show distinctive touches of the new century - a lot more glass and light than in former years, and comfortable cushioned seats. But the place would nevertheless be immediately recognisable to Ray Kroc, McDonald's legendary Founding Father. The Kroc story, reverently told on the McDonald's website, parallels the extraordinary rise of fast-food in America and the consequent transformation of a culture. Back in 1954, Kroc was a salesman peddling milk-shake mixing machines, when he heard about a hamburger stand in San Bernardino in California, which was using eight of his products, turning out 40 shakes simultaneously. </p> <p>He flew out to witness this phenomenon and found a pair of brothers running a perfectly synchronised operation, consistently turning out the best french fries Kroc had ever tasted. The brothers were called Mac and Dick McDonald, and Kroc offered to buy their franchise rights. The rest is culinary history. The McDonald's chain appeared just as national life was being transformed by the consumer-driven economy. Americans suddenly had more mobility and money, and less time. Ray Kroc's company exploded like a chain reaction. </p> <p>McDonald's and its imitators gave the people exactly what they wanted - and the fast food industry consequently grew into a juggernaut. Americans now spend $120bn a year on hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza, more than on colleges, computers or new cars. One in four Americans eats a fast-food meal every day. </p> <p>But the nation is paying the price of satisfying its own cravings. The \"perfect\" chip engineered and mass produced by Ray Kroc turned out to be the perfect vehicle for delivering tasty fat, as did the 20%-fat ground beef in fast-food burgers. </p> <p>McDonald's and the other fast-food chains are now being blamed for the US obesity rate, the highest in the world - an epidemic affecting half the country's adults and a quarter of its children. According to an excoriating analysis published this year in the book Fast Food Nation, McDonald's is also the lead culprit behind many of the ills besetting corporate America - from the chronic low wages and benefits paid to its staff to the uniformity its mammoth purchasing power has imposed on the countryside. </p> <p>\"The low price of the fast-food hamburger does not reflect its real cost,\" Eric Schlosser, the book's author argues. \"Profits of fast-food chains have been made possible by losses imposed on the rest of society.\" Fast Food Nation has caused a moderate stir in the national press, but in Solomons, Maryland, the tangible promise of the golden arches still looms higher than its theoretical costs. Even Suzie Price, the manager of the neighbouring Burger King, says her new competitor, was a plus for the neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"Its more jobs, and more money in people's pockets and more choices of what to buy with it,\" she says, pointing to the perfect symmetry of the industry in which she works. It provides cheap meals for the increasing number of people working in low-paid service jobs, like those offered by the new McDonald's. It completes its own circle. </p> <p> <b>Vikas Puri, India: an aspirational experience</b><br><b>Luke Harding</b></p> <p>Rising like a yellow and orange cathedral into the air, the new cinema complex at Vikas Puri has a lot to offer. There are three giant screens showing English and Hindi movies. There is state-of-the-art air-conditioning, a feature that works even when the power in Delhi fails, which it often does. </p> <p>And there is the latest branch of McDonald's: India's 27th McDonald's restaurant and the world's 29,000 and something-th. The McDonald's golden arches, one of capitalism's most instantly recognisable symbols, have not yet been erected above the front entrance. But they soon will be. </p> <p>We are in suburban Delhi, some 40 minutes by car away from the centre of town. Vikas Puri is an anonymous sort of place: its streets full of homeopathic doctors, suit and dupatta houses, and unfinished flyovers. The two-storey restaurant is nearly ready. The kitchen is pretty much done and the ice-making machine has arrived. Women labourers in saris are busy hefting the last floor tiles into place, carried on their heads in baskets. The ground floor is enveloped in drilling and banging. Upstairs, a woman is busy scrubbing what will soon be the dining area. She looks thoroughly pissed off. </p> <p>In many ways, it is appropriate that McDonald's should have chosen this as the latest staging post in a seemingly endless journey of expansion. Vikas Puri is pleasantly mundane. And like many other parts of urban India, it has a lot of cows. But none of them will find their way onto the trays of hungry diners when the branch opens next week. </p> <p>When McDonald's came to India almost five years ago following economic liberalisation, the decision was taken \u0096 uniquely \u0096 not to serve beef. The cow has been revered on the subcontinent for thousands of years. Local managers reasoned correctly that any attempt to offer cooked cow would have been greeted with firebombs from irate Hindu protesters. Because of Muslim sensitivities, pork was off the menu too. That left chicken and lamb \u0096 the ingredients of McDonald's flagship Maharaja Mac (which, I can reveal, tastes remarkably similar to the original Big Mac). </p> <p>McDonald's started modestly in India. The company felt that if it could succeed in a country that did not eat beef, it could succeed anywhere. Using a local marketing strategy developed elsewhere, McDonald's offered distinctly Indian flavours \u0096 such as the tantalising McAloo Tikki burgers and vegetarian pizza puffs. \"Beef was a complete no no from the start,\" Vikram Bakshi, McDonald's managing director in India, says. \"We have to be sensitive to the culture here. Using beef would have taken us away from 80% of our customers.\" </p> <p>But there are other differences, too. McDonald's in India is only really frequented by the well-off. As such, tucking into a Maharaja Mac at lunchtime is a strangely aspirational experience: all the other diners are well-dressed, have nice table manners, and often spend long periods talking into their mobile phones. </p> <p>A lot of teenagers use McDonald's as an illicit venue to meet their boyfriends/girlfriends, still a tricky operation in middle-class India. \"Many of the young people who use our restaurants, especially the young women, are in jeans,\" Mr Bakshi says. \"They are superficially westernised but they are still very much focused on their studies and on their parents.\" </p> <p>Those behind the counter doling out the McChicken Kebab burgers, meanwhile, are also educated. \"We get a lot of people doing law MBAs working for our organisation,\" he adds. It is not clear whether this top-end strategy has succeeded. McDonald's hopes to expand to 80 branches in India by 2003. </p> <p>But the figure is tiny compared to the 260 restaurants already open in China, or the 3,000 in Japan. The main difficulty is that while India potentially offers a market of 1bn people, most of them are far too poor to ever afford a Maharaja Mac \u0096 not least the 300 labourers currently putting the finishing touches to Vikas Puri's Notre Dame-like superplex. The workers earn around 100 rupees a day (\u00a31.50), just enough to get them a burger, medium soft drink and medium fries. It is this and other somewhat embarrassing facts that have been seized on by anti-globalisation protesters, who argue that McDonald's food is \"bad\", \"expensive\" and \"un-Indian\". </p> <p>\"India has a very ancient food culture.

      "bodyText": "Cachoeirinha, Brazil: a vote of confidence Alex Bellos When Brazilian footballer Ronaldo and his wife Milene were choosing a name for their child they wanted something that sounded like the father's name but was a little different. \"We chose Ronald,\" says Milene, \"It fitted perfectly. And also, Ronaldo and I love eating at McDonald's.\" Since Ronald McDonald arrived in Brazil 22 years ago he has made a big impression on Latin America's largest nation. Brazil has 554 McDonald's restaurants, a similar amount of McDonald's ice-cream kiosks (the number varies according to the season), and the total is growing at a rate of 70 restaurants and 50 kiosks a year. Tomorrow, a Drive-Thru outlet is due to open in Cachoeirinha, a satellite town of Porto Alegre in the south of the country. It is part of the second wave of McDonald's' expansion in Brazil. The first was to the main cities. The second is a push inland. A big party has been arranged that will include musical performances with gaucho men and women in regional dress and, less traditionally, a belly-dancer. The local priest, Father Dionisio Kemper, will bless the establishment. Four hundred customised metal badges have been ordered to share between the employees and special guests. \"Even though McDonald's is a multinational,\" says Shioji Honda, the 29-year-old manager, \"people see it as a local company. It helps the whole community, with local labour and jobs. It unites the community.\" A week ago there was nothing at the site along Cachoeirinha's main street where McDonald's now stands. Then the prefab building with cream walls and a blue roof was delivered and put up in 72 hours. The highest point visible in the town is a 16m pole supporting a pair of golden arches; one more town colonised by the Big Mac. Honda interviewed more than 350 young people for the 53 jobs. \"Everyone wants to work at McDonald's,\" he adds. McDonald's is well-known for not insisting on previous experience and is an established route into the workplace for tens of thousands of young Brazilians. About two thirds of McDonald's' 36,000 employees started their working lives there. Almost 90% are under 21. When the branch opens it will be the first job for M\u00e1rcia de Oliveira Trinidade, aged 18. \"My friend worked in a McDonald's in a shopping centre, she said I should do it. She said it's a really good place to work. Most of the others are my age, it's a good atmosphere.\" M\u00e1rcia's starting salary is \u00a336 a month for a four-hour day, which works out at less than 45p an hour. It doesn't sound like much but the national minimum wage is \u00a349 for twice as many hours. Many entire families survive - albeit in abject misery - on the minimum wage. A Big Mac costs \u00a31.16, meaning that M\u00e1rcia has to work more than three hours to be able to afford one. Brazilian McDonald's uses exclusively Brazilian ingredients and has developed its own products, such as passion fruit juice, banana tart and guava sauce for ice cream. Brazilians have also embraced the Americanisms, abbreviating a Big Mac to a \"Big\" and introducing terms such as McDuplo, McMilla and McOferta. Quarter Pounder has been officially adapted to the nearest word, Quarterao - a bizarre choice since its literal meaning is a person with a quarter black blood. Brazil is the world's largest Catholic country, and over Easter the Cachoeirinha branch will - like the others in the chain - be promoting its line of McFish. Even so, Father Dionisio says he has no intention of staying on after his blessing. Brazil is no stranger to anti-imperialist sentiment. The area around Porto Alegre, in fact, was the focus for violent protests against biochemical giant Monsanto's genetically modified soya seeds this year. Yet McDonald's has not attracted the same anti-globilisation resentment. The widespread poverty and unfair distribution of wealth in Brazil has meant that the decision to open a McDonald's store in the town is seen as a welcome vote of confidence. Edir Oliveira, a local leftwing councillor in Cachoeirinha, said he was proud that the chain was coming to Cachoeirinha. \"There is lots of unemployment here. The more work that comes the better.\" Before each McDonald's opens, there is usually a family night, in which parents of the employees are asked to attend the restaurant and be served a meal by their children. \"This is very emotional. In Brazil most first jobs are part of the informal economy. It's important for a mother to see that her daughter has an honest job,\" says Ayrton Kanitz, a McDonald's spokesperson. The growth of McDonald's in Brazil has been in parallel with the fate of the currency, which after years of hyperinflation is now stable. The effect was to give the poorer sectors of society more disposable income. This is perhaps best seen in a favela shantytown in Rio de Janeiro, which this year became the first in Brazil to have its own branch of McDonald's. As well as demonstrating the urbanisation of slum areas, it shows that McDonald's is the multinational best-placed to step in where others fear to tread. The favela branch does so well that it does equivalent business to the kiosk at the glitzy Barra shopping mall three miles away, which is frequented by the richest sector of Rio's population. In Porto Alegre, where Carlos Henrique Silva Alvares looks after seven outlets, he has seen a move from McDonald's opening in shopping centres to less heavily urban areas like Cachoeirinha. \"The Drive-Thru is an evolution. Before, cars were a luxury. Now they are a necessity.\" The McDonald's identikit Drive-Thru restaurants may look plastic and ugly, yet they can hardly be said to disfigure places such as Cachoeirinha, which are often randomly planned and an untidy mess of odd-sized buildings anyway. Cachoeirinha is only 35 years old, making it younger than McDonald's itself. One McDonald's promotion that has gone down especially well in Brazil are the McHappy Days, in which Big Mac sales are donated to cancer charities. In a McHappy Day last year 5.3m Big Macs were sold - making the Brazilian McHappy Day the most successful in the world. \"Brazilians really go in for this type of solidarity,\" said Honda. Maryland, US: still hungry for more Julian Borger It is hard to imagine anything less noteworthy than the appearance of a new McDonald's franchise in Solomons, Maryland. The construction of the red-roofed white box alongside its rival and twin, Burger King, completes the normal landscape of contemporary America. Its absence is more cause for comment than its presence. The Solomons McDonald's near the end of a peninsular jutting out into Chesapeake Bay, is the 12,900th in the US, approximately (McDonald's head office is not entirely sure of the exact figure). Yet the market is clearly not yet saturated. Forty six years after its founding, the fast-food chain is still growing in its home country. In a crowded and competitive market, amid changing consumer tastes and trends, 175 new branches in the US last year. According to a new book about the fast food industry, more American schoolchildren can identify the McDonald's golden arches than can recognise the Christian crucifix. The country's newest McDonald's is set at one end of a strip mall, a line of generic shops that give the US highways their uniform appearance. Preparations were underway up to the last hour before the ritual blessing from Ronald McDonald, the company's ever-smiling mascot. This will be one of three actors who inhabit Ronald's form at any one time across the country, who appear at outlets and hospital wards where they trigger ecstasy among small children. Before Ronald's coming, there is much to be done. Inside the restaurant, the staff are sampling the french fries while county inspectors ensure that hygiene standards are met. Outside, a crew of landscape artists are on their hands and knees ensuring the plot conforms to a rigid set of rules governing how many bushes and how much lawn should surround each restaurant. Steve Bugge, the crew foreman, said his firm maintains 150 such McDonald's gardens in the Virginia and Maryland region with occasional flashes of individualism; a myrtle tree here or a yew bush there, but essentially, Mr Bugge says, \"they are all the same blueprint\". He has been landscaping McDonald's outlets for 19 years, and each year, he insists, \"they get a little bit better, a little more responsive to the consumer\". The Solomons restaurant does indeed show distinctive touches of the new century - a lot more glass and light than in former years, and comfortable cushioned seats. But the place would nevertheless be immediately recognisable to Ray Kroc, McDonald's legendary Founding Father. The Kroc story, reverently told on the McDonald's website, parallels the extraordinary rise of fast-food in America and the consequent transformation of a culture. Back in 1954, Kroc was a salesman peddling milk-shake mixing machines, when he heard about a hamburger stand in San Bernardino in California, which was using eight of his products, turning out 40 shakes simultaneously. He flew out to witness this phenomenon and found a pair of brothers running a perfectly synchronised operation, consistently turning out the best french fries Kroc had ever tasted. The brothers were called Mac and Dick McDonald, and Kroc offered to buy their franchise rights. The rest is culinary history. The McDonald's chain appeared just as national life was being transformed by the consumer-driven economy. Americans suddenly had more mobility and money, and less time. Ray Kroc's company exploded like a chain reaction. McDonald's and its imitators gave the people exactly what they wanted - and the fast food industry consequently grew into a juggernaut. Americans now spend $120bn a year on hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza, more than on colleges, computers or new cars. One in four Americans eats a fast-food meal every day. But the nation is paying the price of satisfying its own cravings. The \"perfect\" chip engineered and mass produced by Ray Kroc turned out to be the perfect vehicle for delivering tasty fat, as did the 20%-fat ground beef in fast-food burgers. McDonald's and the other fast-food chains are now being blamed for the US obesity rate, the highest in the world - an epidemic affecting half the country's adults and a quarter of its children. According to an excoriating analysis published this year in the book Fast Food Nation, McDonald's is also the lead culprit behind many of the ills besetting corporate America - from the chronic low wages and benefits paid to its staff to the uniformity its mammoth purchasing power has imposed on the countryside. \"The low price of the fast-food hamburger does not reflect its real cost,\" Eric Schlosser, the book's author argues. \"Profits of fast-food chains have been made possible by losses imposed on the rest of society.\" Fast Food Nation has caused a moderate stir in the national press, but in Solomons, Maryland, the tangible promise of the golden arches still looms higher than its theoretical costs. Even Suzie Price, the manager of the neighbouring Burger King, says her new competitor, was a plus for the neighbourhood. \"Its more jobs, and more money in people's pockets and more choices of what to buy with it,\" she says, pointing to the perfect symmetry of the industry in which she works. It provides cheap meals for the increasing number of people working in low-paid service jobs, like those offered by the new McDonald's. It completes its own circle. Vikas Puri, India: an aspirational experience Luke Harding Rising like a yellow and orange cathedral into the air, the new cinema complex at Vikas Puri has a lot to offer. There are three giant screens showing English and Hindi movies. There is state-of-the-art air-conditioning, a feature that works even when the power in Delhi fails, which it often does. And there is the latest branch of McDonald's: India's 27th McDonald's restaurant and the world's 29,000 and something-th. The McDonald's golden arches, one of capitalism's most instantly recognisable symbols, have not yet been erected above the front entrance. But they soon will be. We are in suburban Delhi, some 40 minutes by car away from the centre of town. Vikas Puri is an anonymous sort of place: its streets full of homeopathic doctors, suit and dupatta houses, and unfinished flyovers. The two-storey restaurant is nearly ready. The kitchen is pretty much done and the ice-making machine has arrived. Women labourers in saris are busy hefting the last floor tiles into place, carried on their heads in baskets. The ground floor is enveloped in drilling and banging. Upstairs, a woman is busy scrubbing what will soon be the dining area. She looks thoroughly pissed off. In many ways, it is appropriate that McDonald's should have chosen this as the latest staging post in a seemingly endless journey of expansion. Vikas Puri is pleasantly mundane. And like many other parts of urban India, it has a lot of cows. But none of them will find their way onto the trays of hungry diners when the branch opens next week. When McDonald's came to India almost five years ago following economic liberalisation, the decision was taken \u0096 uniquely \u0096 not to serve beef. The cow has been revered on the subcontinent for thousands of years. Local managers reasoned correctly that any attempt to offer cooked cow would have been greeted with firebombs from irate Hindu protesters. Because of Muslim sensitivities, pork was off the menu too. That left chicken and lamb \u0096 the ingredients of McDonald's flagship Maharaja Mac (which, I can reveal, tastes remarkably similar to the original Big Mac). McDonald's started modestly in India. The company felt that if it could succeed in a country that did not eat beef, it could succeed anywhere. Using a local marketing strategy developed elsewhere, McDonald's offered distinctly Indian flavours \u0096 such as the tantalising McAloo Tikki burgers and vegetarian pizza puffs. \"Beef was a complete no no from the start,\" Vikram Bakshi, McDonald's managing director in India, says. \"We have to be sensitive to the culture here. Using beef would have taken us away from 80% of our customers.\" But there are other differences, too. McDonald's in India is only really frequented by the well-off. As such, tucking into a Maharaja Mac at lunchtime is a strangely aspirational experience: all the other diners are well-dressed, have nice table manners, and often spend long periods talking into their mobile phones. A lot of teenagers use McDonald's as an illicit venue to meet their boyfriends/girlfriends, still a tricky operation in middle-class India. \"Many of the young people who use our restaurants, especially the young women, are in jeans,\" Mr Bakshi says. \"They are superficially westernised but they are still very much focused on their studies and on their parents.\" Those behind the counter doling out the McChicken Kebab burgers, meanwhile, are also educated. \"We get a lot of people doing law MBAs working for our organisation,\" he adds. It is not clear whether this top-end strategy has succeeded. McDonald's hopes to expand to 80 branches in India by 2003. But the figure is tiny compared to the 260 restaurants already open in China, or the 3,000 in Japan. The main difficulty is that while India potentially offers a market of 1bn people, most of them are far too poor to ever afford a Maharaja Mac \u0096 not least the 300 labourers currently putting the finishing touches to Vikas Puri's Notre Dame-like superplex. The workers earn around 100 rupees a day (\u00a31.50), just enough to get them a burger, medium soft drink and medium fries. It is this and other somewhat embarrassing facts that have been seized on by anti-globalisation protesters, who argue that McDonald's food is \"bad\", \"expensive\" and \"un-Indian\". \"India has a very ancient food culture. We are not going to change to American patterns of consumption. McDonald's will never become part of mass culture here because most people can't afford to eat there,\" says Dr Vandana Shiva, director of the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology. This view was echoed by Satish Kapaur, who runs a modest food stall directly opposite Vikas Puri's new McDonald's. \"When the cinema opens in May, more people will come and eat at my stall. Only the rich can afford McDonald's,\" he says. Mr Kapaur offers me a plate of rice, chana masala and chilli. The cost of this delicious meal was a mere 10 rupees (15p). Critics of McDonald's in India say the firm is not making a profit. Certainly, the company globally has had a poor first quarter \u0096 largely because of consumer fears over BSE and problems with the euro. Anti-McDonald's campaigners would say the general public is growing more discerning. But in Vikas Puri the sums seem to work out. \"We expect 5,000 people to visit on weekdays and 10,000 on Saturdays and Sundays,\" the complex's marketing manager, Rajesh Chauhau, says. \"We expect middle-class sort of people to come here. Personally, I like Maharaja Macs,\" he adds. Greece: getting the fast-food habit Michael Howard Tomorrow, in the hectic heart of the Greek capital, McDonald's opens its first ever Olympic Games theme restaurant. Between now and the start of the Athens 2004 Games, Greeks and tourists will chomp their way through thousands of tons of \"Olympic burgers\" as famous Olympians past and present stare down at them from the walls of a restored neo-classical building on Omonia square.

In the UK and across northern Europe temperatures climbed into the high 30s, and in Rotterdam, Holland, the sun beat down on football fans attending Euro 2000. The harbour city was in party mood and on Sunday the fine weather was a convenient excuse for chilled beer. For 60 Chinese illegal immigrants however, huddled in the back of a sealed container lorry in a warehouse in the city's docks, the heat was to prove devastating.</p> <p>Ke Su Di, 20, was among them. A delivery boy from Fujian, he had left his family home 11 days previously. His parents had paid a snakehead smuggling gang \u00a34,000, the first instalment of a \u00a320,000 fee equivalent to 10 years' wages, to get him to the UK. When he left, his head was full of dreams of western prosperity, both for himself and his parents. Now, dressed in three layers of clothing to avoid carrying luggage, he squatted in the decrepit container and waited for the last leg of the journey to get under way. He can have had no idea that he would be one of only two to leave the lorry alive.</p> <p>The group had gathered at around 2.30 that afternoon, travelling in two groups from safe houses to the warehouse in Waalhaven, a section of Rotterdam's 35-mile-long harbour. It had been rented by a man claiming to be in the alcohol export trade. Inside was a white 1995 Mercedes truck hooked up to an 18-metre container, its refrigeration unit long broken.</p> <p>As well as the 60 Chinese, half a dozen other men were present, including a tall, broad-shouldered lorry driver and petty criminal called Perry Wacker, who chain-smoked as he helped the Chinese board the lorry. For Wacker this was to be more than just another driving job. It marked his graduation from the ranks of the gang's petty criminals. In eight years he had travelled across Europe delivering fruit and vegetables, hi-fis and vacuum cleaners, and occasionally he helped himself to a little of his loads; in 1996 he was convicted of stealing TVs. The following year he was found guilty of insurance and benefit fraud, to go with juvenile convictions for vandalism and burglary.</p> <p>Once all 60 were aboard, four containers of water were passed up along with plastic bags for excrement, and a stack of tomato boxes were loaded by Wacker and others into a specially built frame at the rear of the container. Using sign language, Wacker pointed out a small vent on the left hand side of the trailer which was to be their only source of light and air. When this was open, he indicated, they should talk only quietly. When it was closed, as it would be at some point, they should remain silent. Then the doors closed.</p> <p>Shortly before 3pm Wacker climbed into the cab and set out for Zeebrugge with his human freight. Travelling via Antwerp, he arrived at the ferry terminal around 6pm, 90 minutes before the ferry was due to depart.</p> <p><b> Secrecy</b><br></p> <p>At 7pm he was waved forwards to board the European Pathway, a P&amp;O freight-only ferry bound for Dover. The time had come for total secrecy. Wacker climbed up on to the front wheel arch of the truck, untied the rope with which the air vent had been held open, forced the small door closed, and climbed above deck in search of his dinner. With this act he sealed his cargo's fate. Inside, Ke Su Di saw Wacker's hand reach up, then blackness.</p> <p>While Wacker dined on roast lamb and watched two videos, The Mummy and Austin Powers, inside the container the 56 men and four women baked. They discarded layers of clothes, finished the water and desperately sucked at the tomatoes for moisture. Within two hours many of them were near collapse. The stagnant, fetid air inside the lorry was slowly turning to carbon dioxide; every breath added poison to the atmosphere. As panic set in, oxygen levels plummeted. Those with any strength remaining began to pound the side of the lorry with their shoes and shout for help, more interested now in survival than secrecy.</p> <p>\"People began to panic because the window was shut and there was no air,\" Ke Su Di told Maidstone crown court, describing the last moments before he passed out. \"Some people removed tomatoes and wanted to kick open the doors. There was a lot of shouting and screaming but no-one came to help.\"</p> <p>Resigned to their fate, the 60 settled down, held hands and ate some of the tomatoes. In China it is believed you should not leave a hungry ghost. By the time the European Pathway docked at Dover at 11.30pm everyone but Ke Su Di and Ke Shi Guang, 22, were dead.</p> <p>At Dover, customs officers were waiting. They had already decided to stop Wacker's lorry but had no idea what they might find. The vehicle was registered to an unfamiliar company, Van der Speck Transport, and had attracted the attention of P&amp;O staff in Zeebrugge when Wacker paid the fare of \u00a3412.50 in cash. The bulk of freight traffic is paid by account and staff automatically forward details of any vehicle paying in cash to the destination port. The vehicle manifest was faxed ahead, citing the cargo as tomatoes bound for Bristol.</p> <p>The first thing the search team noticed as they swung open the rear doors of the container was the heat. \"I expected a blast of cold air but this was really warm,\" said one officer. Sensing something was not right, a senior officer climbed a ladder to look over the tomatoes and shouted, \"Hello, hello\". He heard a small noise, then silence. \"Illegals, I think they might be in trouble,\" he called to colleagues.</p> <p>Two dock workers were summoned to help clear the tomatoes and they were the first into the container. One of them, Barry Betts, saw what he thought was a pile of pallets. In fact, it was \"a sea of bodies\". As his eyes adjusted to the darkness and took in the horror of what lay before him, he heard moaning and watched as Di and Guang struggled to free themselves from under the dead. Outside, Wacker stood expressionless, stroking the head of a customs sniffer dog.</p> <p>For the 58 Chinese who met their stifling demise in the back of Wacker's lorry, Dover was the end of a journey that began in the rural Chinese province of Fujian. Ke Su Di wanted to escape, to leave behind his constant feuds with neighbours and to help secure his family's future. He earned around \u00a350 a month delivering food, the same as his father who had a wife and three children to support. \"In China, life was not too good. I didn't have a good life at home and the snakehead told me there would be no risk... we want to come to Britain because you can earn good money. Life is good there,\" he said.</p> <p>The leader of the local snakehead gang was Chen Xiakong, arrested earlier this year in a discotheque in Fujian on charges of people smuggling. He was responsible for a former shipment which resulted in more than 100 people being returned by the Canadian authorities. Xiakong charged Ke Su Di \u00a320,000 for transport to Dover, accepting a deposit of around \u00a34,000, with balance payable on arrival in the west. Once he had made his initial payment he and the rest of the Dover 60 were locked on a course that would take them through nine countries, guided by a criminal organisation whose sophisticated network stretches from Beijing to Britain and beyond.</p> <p>Ke Su Di and Ke Shi Guang were cheated. Both men thought they would be flying to the UK, travelling on their own legitimate passports. For at least part of the journey this was the case. They flew from Beijing to Belgrade, the gateway for illegal immigration into the EU. Close ties between Beijing and an increasingly isolated Milosevic regime made access easy for Chinese citizens, and tens of thousands of Chinese took advantage. At any one time around 50,000 of the 200,000 Chinese in Yugoslavia are preparing to leave Belgrade for the west, a senior immigration intelligence source told the Guardian.</p> <p><b>Codewords</b><br></p> <p>Wearing their \"uniform\" of grey T-shirts and black trousers and armed with codewords issued by the snakeheads to prevent rival gangs picking them up in error, the pair, by now part of a larger group of around 15 immigrants, moved by road and on foot towards Hungary. Here the journey met its first hitch. Hungarian border police kicked open the doors of the van in which they were travelling and discovered the immigrants, turning them back towards Yugoslavia.</p> <p>No matter. Within days they tried again and this time succeeded. At this point both men had their Chinese passports confiscated by their snakehead minder, and were given fake Korean documents. With these they passed quickly through Hungary before crossing into Austria in a van with darkened windows, crouching in silence as torches probed the cab.</p> <p>Here the group had their first brush with disaster. They were left in the back of the van for more than three hours, during which time it became harder to breathe and three people fell unconscious. The others, realising the danger they were in, kicked out the windows and revived their colleagues.</p> <p>This was the group's last attempt at concealment until the fatal journey to Dover. They proceeded to Vienna where, on their forged Korean passports, they caught a plane to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. From here they took a train to Belgium and then on to Rotterdam, arriving on June 15 to find the station platform a sea of Dutch football fans.</p> <p>As the Dover 60 were making their way north in small groups, preparations were being made in Rotterdam and London for the final leg. In Rotterdam a local Turkish mafia gang, under the leadership of Gurbel Ozcan, 36, had been sub-contracted to take responsibility for the snakeheads' assets. Ozcan, who cruised Rotterdam in a black Mercedes with darkened windows, was a hardened people smuggler. In 1998 he served six months for people trafficking offences and in the months preceding the fatal June shipment he sent two other lorries laden with Chinese immigrants across the Channel.</p> <p>Ozcan and his co-conspirators met to discuss the operation in the bar of the New York hotel, Rotterdam, on Monday June 12, six days before the transport. Unknown to Ozcan, however, his car had been bugged by Dutch police, and his every move was monitored. Inexplicably, the police lifted their surveillance of the gang leader just before the weekend on which the Dover transport was made, convinced that Ozcan had no imminent operations planned.</p> <p>The opposite was the case. Leo Nijveen, an old friend of Perry Wacker's and a sometime driver for Ozcan's lorries, told police a backlog of migrants was building up in Rotterdam and Ozcan was concerned at the cost of housing and feeding them. He ordered the overloading of lorries heading for England.</p> <p>On April 5 Nijveen himself had been in charge of one of these lorries with 50 Chinese on board along with the token pallet of legitimate cargo, in this case yoghurt. Halfway through the 3.30am Zeebrugge-Dover crossing Nijveen heard screaming and banging from the lorry as its human cargo began to run out of oxygen. Nijveen, unlike Wacker, threw open the doors and let the Chinese out. They were processed at the Dover immigration centre, and Nijveen was fined \u00a32,000 per head, then allowed to return to Holland. Police later said there was insufficient evidence to show he knew they were on board.</p> <p>Despite the April 5 incident, Ozcan was determined to clear the backlog. A number of petty crooks were hired to do the dirty work, thus shielding Ozcan from any investigation. Hubertus van Keulen, 50, was paid \u00a31,200 to rent the warehouse at Waalhaven, while Willem Jansen, 49, was paid \u00a32,000 to buy the tomatoes, the dummy cargo, which Nijveen and Wacker later collected. The pair also bought the tractor unit of the truck from a garage near Wacker's home, and later purchased the trailer.</p> <p>Nijveen had been retained as an advisor and it was he who recruited Wacker, a lorry driver from Rotterdam's eastern suburbs. The pair had worked together as drivers for a transport firm run by Ronald Wacker, Perry's uncle, and Nijveen knew his friend was desperate for cash. Wacker was due to be married in Rotterdam on July 17, a month after the transport, to a Moroccan girl called Nora he had met in Spain the previous year.</p> <p>Wacker was desperate for money. His fiancee was not an EU national and he had to satisfy Dutch authorities that he could support both of them. Nijveen was keen to offload the driving work to someone else and introduced Wacker to the conspiracy, telling him he stood to make at least \u00a330,000 at \u00a3500 per person. Wacker agreed.</p> <p>With a driver engaged, the final stage in the preparations was to set up a cover company to protect Ozcan and the snakeheads in the event that the consignment was discovered by customs. For this they needed a front man, a \"katvanger\", someone paid to provide a cover identity for criminal operations. For the ill-fated transport the gang engaged Arien van der Speck, a punchy petty criminal from the eastern suburb of Terbregge.</p> <p>Days before the transport, Van der Speck visited the Rotterdam chamber of commerce and founded a haulage firm, Van Der Speck Transport. He took his money and left, hearing nothing more until the Rotterdam police knocked on his door on June 19. He has since been charged with false certification.</p> <p>The final stage in the journey was organised by snakeheads living among London's 60,000-strong Chinatown community. To them fell the task of organising asylum applications, and more importantly making arrangements for final fees to be paid. The Dover 60's first point of contact in the UK was to be a young Chinese interpreter, Ying Guo, 29, known to many who worked with her as Jenny. Twenty-seven of those that died had her mobile phone number on them, either on a scrap of paper or stitched into their clothing.</p> <p>A Mandarin speaker from north-eastern China, Guo who arrived in England in late August 1996, travelling legally on a student visa to study English, accounting and computing at Edgware College, north London. She had worked in a car factory in China earning around \u00a3500 a month but hoped to qualify as an accountant during her time in the UK.</p> <p>Within three years, however, Jenny Guo had built herself a successful and relatively lucrative career on the margins of the legal profession, thanks to a chance encounter with a friend who needed an interpreter to help him at a meeting at the Home Office immigration centre in Croydon, south London. Guo went along, and soon she was spending around 40 hours a week interpreting for asylum applicants at home office screenings and interviews with solicitors. More importantly, she began introducing clients to a network of solicitors across London, clients for whom she then acted. In 18 months, from January 1999, she had dealings with more than 366 asylum applicants, mostly Chinese, 7% of all Chinese applicants dealt with by the Home Office during that period.</p> <p>One solicitor spoke of paying her \u00a310,000 in legal aid claimed for translation work for around 80 clients, another of \u00a35,000 for 40. At the going rate Perry Wacker's lorry was worth \u00a37,500 to Jenny.</p> <p>Four years after entering the country she was able to afford an \u00a383,000 mortgage on a flat in South Woodford, east London. Between March 3 2000 and June 20 she also sent \u00a337,000 back to China using the account of her boyfriend, You Yi. Guo was the first point of contact in the UK for the Dover 60 and on the morning of their expected arrival she was busy finalising arrangements.</p> <p><b>Clients</b><br></p> <p>On the morning of Monday June 19, seven hours after the bodies had been discovered, Guo telephoned Chandika Wolpita, a solicitor at Ratna &amp; Co, in Walworth Road, London. She had referred around 80 clients to him between December 1999 and February 2000, and now asked if he could deal with some asylum matters on behalf of 60 Chinese people. According to his evidence in court, Mr Wolpita called his supervisor who advised him they could take on about 30. Wolpita took the request to mean they had already arrived.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards Gou called again and said she had not heard from the Chinese, and that she would call again later. Around midnight she finally called and said the police had been and removed her computer. In the intervening period Guo had learned of the deaths and panicked, destroying her mobile and deleting files. Many of them were recovered, including draft letters of application for asylum, and a number of invoices to solicitors.</p> <p>The next day, Guo and her boyfriend You Yi, a chef, turned themselves in to Kent police at Canterbury police station. Yi was released without charge and is working in Chinatown. For her part, Guo, who protested her innocence throughout the trial, was last night beginning a six-year sentence for her part in the deaths of 58 Chinese innocents in search of a better life.</p> <p><b>Audio report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0619kelso.ra\"> 19.06.2001: Paul Kelso on 'a nightmare scene' in Dover</a></p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,334420,00.html\"> How the migrants got here</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,468972,00.html\"> 05.04.2001: Lorry driver guilty of killing 58 Chinese immigrants</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,461514,00.html\"> 23.03.2001: Driver 'speechless' over Dover bodies</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,447734,00.html\"> 07.03.2001: Gang 'charged migrant 24 years of pay'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,447097,00.html\"> 06.03.2001: Dock worker found 'sea of bodies' in lorry</a></p>",

In the UK and across northern Europe temperatures climbed into the high 30s, and in Rotterdam, Holland, the sun beat down on football fans attending Euro 2000. The harbour city was in party mood and on Sunday the fine weather was a convenient excuse for chilled beer. For 60 Chinese illegal immigrants however, huddled in the back of a sealed container lorry in a warehouse in the city's docks, the heat was to prove devastating. Ke Su Di, 20, was among them. A delivery boy from Fujian, he had left his family home 11 days previously.

For this they needed a front man, a \"katvanger\", someone paid to provide a cover identity for criminal operations. For the ill-fated transport the gang engaged Arien van der Speck, a punchy petty criminal from the eastern suburb of Terbregge. Days before the transport, Van der Speck visited the Rotterdam chamber of commerce and founded a haulage firm, Van Der Speck Transport. He took his money and left, hearing nothing more until the Rotterdam police knocked on his door on June 19. He has since been charged with false certification. The final stage in the journey was organised by snakeheads living among London's 60,000-strong Chinatown community. To them fell the task of organising asylum applications, and more importantly making arrangements for final fees to be paid. The Dover 60's first point of contact in the UK was to be a young Chinese interpreter, Ying Guo, 29, known to many who worked with her as Jenny. Twenty-seven of those that died had her mobile phone number on them, either on a scrap of paper or stitched into their clothing. A Mandarin speaker from north-eastern China, Guo who arrived in England in late August 1996, travelling legally on a student visa to study English, accounting and computing at Edgware College, north London. She had worked in a car factory in China earning around \u00a3500 a month but hoped to qualify as an accountant during her time in the UK. Within three years, however, Jenny Guo had built herself a successful and relatively lucrative career on the margins of the legal profession, thanks to a chance encounter with a friend who needed an interpreter to help him at a meeting at the Home Office immigration centre in Croydon, south London. Guo went along, and soon she was spending around 40 hours a week interpreting for asylum applicants at home office screenings and interviews with solicitors. More importantly, she began introducing clients to a network of solicitors across London, clients for whom she then acted. In 18 months, from January 1999, she had dealings with more than 366 asylum applicants, mostly Chinese, 7% of all Chinese applicants dealt with by the Home Office during that period. One solicitor spoke of paying her \u00a310,000 in legal aid claimed for translation work for around 80 clients, another of \u00a35,000 for 40. At the going rate Perry Wacker's lorry was worth \u00a37,500 to Jenny. Four years after entering the country she was able to afford an \u00a383,000 mortgage on a flat in South Woodford, east London. Between March 3 2000 and June 20 she also sent \u00a337,000 back to China using the account of her boyfriend, You Yi. Guo was the first point of contact in the UK for the Dover 60 and on the morning of their expected arrival she was busy finalising arrangements. Clients On the morning of Monday June 19, seven hours after the bodies had been discovered, Guo telephoned Chandika Wolpita, a solicitor at Ratna &amp; Co, in Walworth Road, London. She had referred around 80 clients to him between December 1999 and February 2000, and now asked if he could deal with some asylum matters on behalf of 60 Chinese people. According to his evidence in court, Mr Wolpita called his supervisor who advised him they could take on about 30. Wolpita took the request to mean they had already arrived. Shortly afterwards Gou called again and said she had not heard from the Chinese, and that she would call again later. Around midnight she finally called and said the police had been and removed her computer. In the intervening period Guo had learned of the deaths and panicked, destroying her mobile and deleting files. Many of them were recovered, including draft letters of application for asylum, and a number of invoices to solicitors. The next day, Guo and her boyfriend You Yi, a chef, turned themselves in to Kent police at Canterbury police station. Yi was released without charge and is working in Chinatown. For her part, Guo, who protested her innocence throughout the trial, was last night beginning a six-year sentence for her part in the deaths of 58 Chinese innocents in search of a better life.

He was also found guilty of conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants.</p> <p>Ying Guo, 30, a translator from South Woodford, Essex, was jailed for six years for conspiracy. She was to be the immigrants' contact in Britain.</p> <p>Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Moses said that human trafficking of this kind added to the climate of hostility against asylum seekers and encouraged government to take ever more draconian measures.</p> <p>\"As signatories to the Geneva Convention, the UK must... exercise fair and effective systems of immigration control. Those like you two, who traffic in illegal entrants out of greed, undermine that system.</p> <p>\"Undermining that system creates the risk of oppression and prejudice against those who come to this country seeking protection as calls for more rigorous controls grow louder.\"</p> <p>Wacker received six years for each of the 58 dead, to run concurrently, and a further eight years for conspiracy.

      "bodyText": "A Dutch lorry driver was yesterday jailed for one of the largest mass killings in British criminal history when he was convicted of the manslaughter of 58 Chinese illegal immigrants, who suffocated in the back of his lorry en route to Dover. Perry Wacker, 33, of Rotterdam, was sentenced to 14 years for his part in an organised people smuggling operation, coordinated by a Chinese snakehead gang. He was also found guilty of conspiracy to facilitate the entry of illegal immigrants. Ying Guo, 30, a translator from South Woodford, Essex, was jailed for six years for conspiracy. She was to be the immigrants' contact in Britain. Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Moses said that human trafficking of this kind added to the climate of hostility against asylum seekers and encouraged government to take ever more draconian measures. \"As signatories to the Geneva Convention, the UK must... exercise fair and effective systems of immigration control. Those like you two, who traffic in illegal entrants out of greed, undermine that system. \"Undermining that system creates the risk of oppression and prejudice against those who come to this country seeking protection as calls for more rigorous controls grow louder.\" Wacker received six years for each of the 58 dead, to run concurrently, and a further eight years for conspiracy. He showed no emotion as he was sent down. Mr Justice Moses said Wacker had been central to organising the fatal transport and was guilty of criminal negligence. \"You took no care for the safety of those people [in the lorry] and you share responsibility for the decision to carry so many in such a confined place.\" During the six-week trial Maidstone crown court heard how on June 18, one of the hottest days of last year, Wacker drove from Rotterdam to Zeebrugge, Belgium, with the 60 Chinese illegal immigrants from the province of Fujian in his lorry trailer. A dummy load of tomatoes had been placed at the rear of the trailer to disguise the true cargo, leaving each of the immigrants a space the size of this newspaper page in which to crouch. At Zeebrugge Wacker closed the air vent on the side of the lorry, the passengers' only source of oxygen, to stop them being overheard by port officials. Within three hours all but two of the 60 were dead, suffocated in sweltering temperatures. \"Once you closed the vent you deprived them of the air they needed to stay alive. Each one of those [58 people] was a human being who relied on you - you treated them as cargo,\" said the judge. Two months before the fatal shipment Leo Nijveen, a close friend of Wacker's, was arrested by Kent Police after arriving at Dover with 50 Chinese in his lorry. They had almost suffocated en route and had been released by Nijveen on the crossing. Nijveen was released without charge and returned to the Netherlands. The National Crime Squad, which coordinates operations against organised crime, said details of Nijveen's arrest should have been passed to the Dutch authorities, but the Guardian understands this was not the case. The court heard that Wacker and Nijveen were part of an established gang based in Rotterdam and run by a Turk, Gurzel Ozcan, a convicted people smuggler. Police believe Wacker was to be paid about \u00a317,500 for the shipment. Ozcan, Nijveen and seven others are in custody in the Netherlands awaiting trial, seven of them on manslaughter charges in relation to the deaths. The two survivors, Su Di Ke, 20, and Ke Shi Guang, 22, have conditional leave to remain in Britain for four years.",

      "bodyText": "A private consortium of genetics and computer firms has announced plans to trump the deciphering of the human \"book of life\" by mapping and selling a molecule by molecule blueprint of the human body's deepest workings. In an undertaking which may cost as much as US$500m, [\u00a3350m] the Japanese electronics giant Hitachi and the US computer database firm Oracle have teamed up with Utah-based Myriad Genetics to analyse virtually every protein in the human body, and how they interact, by 2004. The move comes less than a year after rival teams of private and publicly funded scientists announced they had decoded the billions of letters of the human genome, the sum of the roughly 30,000 genes which contain the instructions to build and maintain the human body. But what they had not done was analyse the chemicals, or proteins, which actually carry out these instructions - sending messages between cells, building bones and so on. The full set of proteins is called the proteome. The Myriad consortium has now stolen a march on its commercial, government and academic rivals, who have spoken only vaguely about the need for a publicly funded Human Proteome Project, along the lines of the successful Human Genome Project. Myriad and its partners argue that its human proteome map once created will lead to breakthroughs in disease research which the genome information by itself cannot provide. Myriad Genetics, which will own 50% of a new subsidiary called Myriad Proteomics, has been criticised in recent years for its patent claims on two genes which predispose women to get breast cancer. The company has used the patents to restrict competing tests for the gene in favour of its own. Myriad spokesman Bill Hockett said private firms would have to pay to get access to the future human proteome database, although there would be special terms for academic users. Myriad would also have first look at the data, and would patent any proteins it thought valuable for developing new drugs and therapies. Initially, the three firms will invest $185m in the venture. Up to $500m will be needed to finish the job. \"This ambitious project to map the human proteome within three years will enable us to make a great leap forward in our understanding of the causes of human disease,\" said the head of Myriad, Peter Meldrum. \"The human proteome has become the next frontier of modern biology.\" The consortium's announcement was greeted with scepticism by some scientists, who called their ambitious plan too broad. Some of those detractors, however - such as Craig Venter of Celera, who told the New York Times newspaper that the project had little value - are rivals. \"Whenever you undertake an ambitious project, people will say it can't be done, be cause they're not doing it,\" said Mr Hockett. The consortium's announcement coincided with a meeting in the US of a loose group of academic and private sector scientists calling itself the Human Proteome Organisation (Hupo), which seeks to mobilise governments and business to collaborate on a human proteome map. But tackling the proteome is so much more complex and diffuse than the genome that there is little support for a government-backed effort to make the data freely available in the public domain. Asked what he thought the Myriad group's chances of success were, one of the members of Hupo's council, Ian Tomlinson of the Medical Research Council's laboratories in Cambridge, said: \"The three partners in that consortium are all serious about proteomics, so who knows? \"It depends what financial resources they are committing to it.\"",

Mr Edwards, described by friends as a gentle academic, was so badly disfigured by the attack that he could only be identified by dental records. One of his ears was missing, presumed eaten. Published yesterday, a police complaints authority investigation into the death on November 29, 1994, upheld 15 allegations made by Mr Edwards's parents, Paul and Audrey. The report said Christopher, who also had a history of mental illness, should have been examined by a police surgeon when he was first arrested. It said officers failed to complete forms which would have warned the prison service that the two men were inmates of \"exceptionally high risk.\" Police also failed to ensure the examination of the scene was properly recorded and lost other documents, the report concluded. PCA officer Ian Bynoe wrote: \"Detective officers leading the investigation into Christopher's death failed to interview and take statements from several witnesses with information highly relevant to Mr Edwards's allegation that his son's death resulted from gross negligence by those responsible for his health and safety.\" After the killing, the treatment of Mr Edwards's family was, \"totally inadequate\", the report concluded.

Several of Mr Milosevic's key associates are being questioned by Serbian investigators, and some are reported to have started to turn against their former boss and to give damning evidence. One of those being questioned for corruption is Nikola Sainovic, who was a deputy prime minister in charge of police operations in Kosovo, who is also indicted for war crimes. The Hague team will want to know whether he has started to give details which they can use for their own prosecution. Another war crimes indictee, Milan Milutinovic, the current president of Serbia, is to be investigated in Serbia on suspicion that he helped to issue Milosevic cronies with diplomatic passports. Criminal charges were filed against Mr Milosevic's daughter Marija, 32, yesterday for shooting at government officials who negotiated the former president's surrender in his Belgrade villa on Sunday. Police charged her with \"endangering public safety and illegal possession of arms\". Legal experts said she could face up to five years in jail for attempted murder. After Mr Milosevic's arrest on Sunday, Carla del Ponte, the international tribunal's chief prosecutor, indicated that she would be willing to wait a few months before his transfer to the Hague. In any case this cannot happen until a Yugoslav law on co-operation with the tribunal comes into force, probably at the end of next month. Although Jean-Jacques Joris, her political adviser, insisted this week that the Hague team were \"trial-ready\" for Mr Milosevic and he should be sent there immediately, the emerging western political consensus is that governments will allow the Serb authorities to put him on trial for corruption and abuse of power in Belgrade first. Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told President Vojislav Kostunica on Wednesday that he was keen to see the former president put on trial in Serbia first, so that Serbs would see for themselves the extent of his abuses of power. The initial sense of national pride which led most Serbs to resist a trial in the Hague has been evaporating fast. \u0095 Naser Oric, the Bosnian Muslim wartime military chief of Srebrenica, yesterday appealed to protesters worried that he would be arrested to let him tell the Hague tribunal the truth about his role during the 1992-95 war. Mr Oric, who led the defence of Srebrenica before thousands of Muslim men were massacred, was being interviewed by UN investigators in Sarajevo.",

      "body": "<p>Nonsense On Stilts (special edition) Department: Some things are so ludicrous they don't need to be touched by human hands.</p> <p> Like this press release from the government's Defence, Evaluation and Research Agency (Dera), part of which is to be renamed under a public-private partnership. I swear it's real. \"New Dera will be named QinetiQ when it begins trading as a new company,\" it reads. \"The name... was carefully chosen as the outright winner from an original list of 400 which resulted from extensive analysis of all our capabilities and strengths.\" 400?!? \"QinetiQ was seen as particularly distinctive and reflects the organisation's spirit of innovation and creativity but also energy, motion and progress. It is a positive name, with expansive, bold, and assertive overtones, underpinned by a good, solid, technical ring.\" Shoot me. Please. </p> <p>\u0095 In this job there is great comfort to be taken from the old saying, \"a stopped clock is right twice a day\". So it proved yesterday, with the announcement that DeAnne Julius is to step down from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, to be replaced by another \"dove from above\" - an event predicted in this column as long ago as March 20. I'm sorry to make the most of this, but I have a strong premonition it's not going to happen often. If ever. </p> <p>\u0095 Stuart Rose, the modest, shy and retiring chief executive at Arcadia, was holding forth at the retail group's annual results yesterday about what a strong brand Arcadia had in the Burton menswear chain. Until he was asked if he was wearing clothes from Burton - whereupon he went a bit quiet. \"Ahhhh, well...\" Stuart stammered, before confessing that his suit had been made by Richard James, the posh Saville Row tailor to the stars. </p> <p>\u0095 Celebrating the decision of an American court to award $65m worth of damages to the original owner of the highly profitable <a href=\"http://www.sex.com\">sex.com</a> website address, lawyer James Wagstaffe said: \"The substantial size of this damage award sends a message that the internet is not a lawless wasteland.\" </p> <p>Oh yeah? The background is that Stephen Michael Cohen used forged documents to convince the domain name registrars to transfer ownership of the name to himself from the original owner, Gary Kremen of San Francisco. That was in 1995, and it has taken six years for the decision on damages to be reached, during which time Cohen made considerable profits from advertising. True, $65m is a lot, but Cohen's holdings in offshore accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands means the money may be difficult to recover. Cohen couldn't make it to the trial: his lawyers claimed he was under house arrest in Mexico. </p> <p>\u0095 The final Dog of the Day award for this week must go to Tony James and Chuck Ward, the fun loving co-heads of investment banking at CSFB, for their memo cracking down on celebrations for successful share floats. As we note elsewhere, CSFB hasn't lead-managed a single IPO this year anyway. Woof. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:richard.adams@ theguardian.com\">richard.adams@ theguardian.com </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Nonsense On Stilts (special edition) Department: Some things are so ludicrous they don't need to be touched by human hands. Like this press release from the government's Defence, Evaluation and Research Agency (Dera), part of which is to be renamed under a public-private partnership. I swear it's real. \"New Dera will be named QinetiQ when it begins trading as a new company,\" it reads. \"The name... was carefully chosen as the outright winner from an original list of 400 which resulted from extensive analysis of all our capabilities and strengths.\" 400?!? \"QinetiQ was seen as particularly distinctive and reflects the organisation's spirit of innovation and creativity but also energy, motion and progress. It is a positive name, with expansive, bold, and assertive overtones, underpinned by a good, solid, technical ring.\" Shoot me. Please. \u0095 In this job there is great comfort to be taken from the old saying, \"a stopped clock is right twice a day\". So it proved yesterday, with the announcement that DeAnne Julius is to step down from the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, to be replaced by another \"dove from above\" - an event predicted in this column as long ago as March 20. I'm sorry to make the most of this, but I have a strong premonition it's not going to happen often. If ever. \u0095 Stuart Rose, the modest, shy and retiring chief executive at Arcadia, was holding forth at the retail group's annual results yesterday about what a strong brand Arcadia had in the Burton menswear chain. Until he was asked if he was wearing clothes from Burton - whereupon he went a bit quiet. \"Ahhhh, well...\" Stuart stammered, before confessing that his suit had been made by Richard James, the posh Saville Row tailor to the stars. \u0095 Celebrating the decision of an American court to award $65m worth of damages to the original owner of the highly profitable sex.com website address, lawyer James Wagstaffe said: \"The substantial size of this damage award sends a message that the internet is not a lawless wasteland.\" Oh yeah? The background is that Stephen Michael Cohen used forged documents to convince the domain name registrars to transfer ownership of the name to himself from the original owner, Gary Kremen of San Francisco. That was in 1995, and it has taken six years for the decision on damages to be reached, during which time Cohen made considerable profits from advertising. True, $65m is a lot, but Cohen's holdings in offshore accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands means the money may be difficult to recover. Cohen couldn't make it to the trial: his lawyers claimed he was under house arrest in Mexico. \u0095 The final Dog of the Day award for this week must go to Tony James and Chuck Ward, the fun loving co-heads of investment banking at CSFB, for their memo cracking down on celebrations for successful share floats. As we note elsewhere, CSFB hasn't lead-managed a single IPO this year anyway. Woof. richard.adams@ theguardian.com",

The merger is expected to leave Amcor as the biggest shareholder in the producer of packaging for confectionery, snack foods, frozen foods, soups and pharmaceuticals. Speculation about a possible merger has been increasing since Amcor announced earlier this year that it was targeting acquisition opportuni ties in flexible packaging, PET plastic bottles and folding cartons. Amcor's managing director, Mr Russell Jones, has said the company was planning to spend as much as $500m on acquisitions throughout Europe and North America during the next year. The fragmented packaging sector is under severe pressure from an increasingly large group of food and other manufacturing clients who have driven down suppliers' prices while energy costs soared. Amcor spun off the paper operations from its packaging business last year, and said it aimed to build one of the five biggest packaging businesses in the world. Amcor shares were suspended at A$5.76, valuing the company at \u00a31.3bn.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Positive switch at the MPC</strong><br /></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Positive switch at the MPC</strong><br></p> <p>Gordon Brown chose his moment well. On the day the doveish faction on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee tasted victory in the battle over interest rates, he announced that one woman with close links to industry, DeAnne Julius, formally of British Airways, should be replaced by another, Kate Barker of the CBI. </p> <p>Despite the inevitable criticism that the decision is motivated by the need to have a woman on the MPC, it was the right decision. Ms Julius left the MPC of her own volition, and a balanced com mittee needed an economist of similar views to succeed her. Ms Barker is eminently suited to the job. End of story. </p> <p>She joins at an intriguing time. The statement issued by the MPC following the quarter-point cut yesterday underlined the ascendancy of Ms Julius and her brother in arms on the MPC, Sushil Wadhwani. Yes, it said, the domestic economy has remained robust, but the gloomy picture abroad has affected business and consumer confidence, and may yet do more damage. Yes, the labour market is tight, but price and cost pressures remain muted. There is no sign of inflation picking up - on the contrary it will remain below its 2.5% target unless rates are cut. The fact that the statement concludes that the MPC will continue to monitor the downside risks carefully suggests both that further rate cuts are in the pipeline, and that Ms Julius and Mr Wadhwani were pressing for a cut of 50 basis points this month. </p> <p>All this supports the City view that interest rates are coming down to 5% over the next few months, and may go lower. Looking further ahead, it is possible that cost pressures will start to push up inflation, necessitating a rise in rates in 2002. </p> <p>But the fact that underlying inflation is still below 2% should tell the MPC that something fundamental has happened to the relationship between growth, inflation and unemployment. </p> <p>It was to Ms Julius's credit that she spotted the trend early, and was often a lone voice on the MPC before the arrival of Mr Wadhwani. She will be a tough act to follow. </p> <p><strong>Retail diversity</strong><br> </p> <p>In one week we have seen two retail recovery plans from M&amp;S and Arcadia, the UK's number one and two purveyors of clothing. Their plans are not dissimilar - get out of peripheral businesses, concentrate on the core middle market operations, bring some flair and inspiration to the shops, improve customer service and so on - basic retailing, really. </p> <p>Twelve months ago, they were both in deep trouble. Debt-laden Arcadia's problems appeared terminal. </p> <p>In recent months, both of the companies' share prices have undoubtedly benefited from the interest of a foreign investor - the US Brandes group now holds 12% of M&amp;S and the Icelandic Baugur group has built a 20% stake in Arcadia. Both companies insist they are friendly holdings based on value investing. </p> <p>But the TopShop group has performed a Lazarus-style recovery and City analysts, by and large, are mad for it. Its shares have increased sixfold, and yesterday's recovery strategy produced another flurry of excitement and the belief that the company can deliver on its promises. </p> <p>One week on, any excitement that M&amp;S generated has disappeared. </p> <p>The diverse responses are the result of some crucial differences. There are tangible signs of improvement at Arcadia - little things like increasing sales from less space and higher margins - that are still missing at M&amp;S. </p> <p>On basic measures such as the price to earnings ratio, M&amp;S is rated more highly than Arcadia. </p> <p>M&amp;S is run by a Belgian supermarket chief and a McKinsey man who probably wouldn't recognise a fashion trend if it slapped them in the face. The pair are cool management operators with no detectable trace of passion for their product. Arcadia, meanwhile, is run by Stuart Rose, a serial retailer with 17 years of M&amp;S experience, who talks at the pace of Peter O'Sullevan on speed. He is a snappy dresser with a sense of urgency, and the City loves him. What a difference a Top Man makes. </p> <p><strong>Lex reader</strong><br> </p> <p>Here's a cheap rhetorical: what might the venerable Lex column make of news that the Financial Times is trimming 10% of the workforce at FT.com? This is mere cheese-paring, given the scale of spending on the business news site last year - upwards of \u00a3100m - and the severity of the downturn in advertising. </p> <p>FT.com is a great brand. It must be doing intangible wonders for the newspaper's name internationally. </p> <p>But as Lex told its readers yesterday, as it berated the big investment banks for failing to cut staff numbers aggressively in the wake of the bull market blowout, \"business stinks and profits are plunging\". This first cut should have been much deeper.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Positive switch at the MPC Gordon Brown chose his moment well. On the day the doveish faction on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee tasted victory in the battle over interest rates, he announced that one woman with close links to industry, DeAnne Julius, formally of British Airways, should be replaced by another, Kate Barker of the CBI. Despite the inevitable criticism that the decision is motivated by the need to have a woman on the MPC, it was the right decision. Ms Julius left the MPC of her own volition, and a balanced com mittee needed an economist of similar views to succeed her. Ms Barker is eminently suited to the job. End of story. She joins at an intriguing time. The statement issued by the MPC following the quarter-point cut yesterday underlined the ascendancy of Ms Julius and her brother in arms on the MPC, Sushil Wadhwani. Yes, it said, the domestic economy has remained robust, but the gloomy picture abroad has affected business and consumer confidence, and may yet do more damage. Yes, the labour market is tight, but price and cost pressures remain muted. There is no sign of inflation picking up - on the contrary it will remain below its 2.5% target unless rates are cut. The fact that the statement concludes that the MPC will continue to monitor the downside risks carefully suggests both that further rate cuts are in the pipeline, and that Ms Julius and Mr Wadhwani were pressing for a cut of 50 basis points this month. All this supports the City view that interest rates are coming down to 5% over the next few months, and may go lower. Looking further ahead, it is possible that cost pressures will start to push up inflation, necessitating a rise in rates in 2002. But the fact that underlying inflation is still below 2% should tell the MPC that something fundamental has happened to the relationship between growth, inflation and unemployment. It was to Ms Julius's credit that she spotted the trend early, and was often a lone voice on the MPC before the arrival of Mr Wadhwani. She will be a tough act to follow. Retail diversity In one week we have seen two retail recovery plans from M&amp;S and Arcadia, the UK's number one and two purveyors of clothing. Their plans are not dissimilar - get out of peripheral businesses, concentrate on the core middle market operations, bring some flair and inspiration to the shops, improve customer service and so on - basic retailing, really. Twelve months ago, they were both in deep trouble. Debt-laden Arcadia's problems appeared terminal. In recent months, both of the companies' share prices have undoubtedly benefited from the interest of a foreign investor - the US Brandes group now holds 12% of M&amp;S and the Icelandic Baugur group has built a 20% stake in Arcadia. Both companies insist they are friendly holdings based on value investing. But the TopShop group has performed a Lazarus-style recovery and City analysts, by and large, are mad for it. Its shares have increased sixfold, and yesterday's recovery strategy produced another flurry of excitement and the belief that the company can deliver on its promises. One week on, any excitement that M&amp;S generated has disappeared. The diverse responses are the result of some crucial differences. There are tangible signs of improvement at Arcadia - little things like increasing sales from less space and higher margins - that are still missing at M&amp;S. On basic measures such as the price to earnings ratio, M&amp;S is rated more highly than Arcadia. M&amp;S is run by a Belgian supermarket chief and a McKinsey man who probably wouldn't recognise a fashion trend if it slapped them in the face. The pair are cool management operators with no detectable trace of passion for their product. Arcadia, meanwhile, is run by Stuart Rose, a serial retailer with 17 years of M&amp;S experience, who talks at the pace of Peter O'Sullevan on speed. He is a snappy dresser with a sense of urgency, and the City loves him. What a difference a Top Man makes. Lex reader Here's a cheap rhetorical: what might the venerable Lex column make of news that the Financial Times is trimming 10% of the workforce at FT.com? This is mere cheese-paring, given the scale of spending on the business news site last year - upwards of \u00a3100m - and the severity of the downturn in advertising. FT.com is a great brand. It must be doing intangible wonders for the newspaper's name internationally. But as Lex told its readers yesterday, as it berated the big investment banks for failing to cut staff numbers aggressively in the wake of the bull market blowout, \"business stinks and profits are plunging\". This first cut should have been much deeper.",

A similar Israeli booby trap in 1996 was followed by a wave of suicide bombings.</p> <p>The killing in the West Bank town of Jenin came only hours after Israeli soldiers shot up a convoy carrying a senior Palestinian negotiator, Mohammed Dahlan, back from peace talks. He escaped injury, but one of his bodyguards was shot in the leg and two others were injured when their vehicle overturned.</p> <p>Mr Dahlan, a member of the inner circle of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is the most senior Palestinian yet to be on the receiving end of Israeli fire.</p> <p>The Palestinians claimed it was a botched assassination attempt while the Israelis insisted the Palestinians opened fire first. The Israeli army promised an investigation.</p> <p>After a relatively quiet Wednesday that saw political initiatives from both sides, the hardline Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, resorted to the iron fist yesterday.</p> <p>In addition to the violence that also saw the Israelis kill Ahmed Mahmoud al-Atar, a 15-year-old Palestinian who was throwing stones, the Israeli government threatened to add to the already deteriorating situation by inviting tenders for 700 new houses for Jewish settlers in the predominantly Palestinian West Bank.</p> <p>Israeli peace campaigners condemned the announcement, while the United States called the move provocative and inflammatory.

      "bodyText": "Israel stepped up reprisals against the Palestinians yesterday by assassinating a commander of the militant Islamic Jihad group with an explosive device planted in a public phone box. Islamic Jihad, which has been responsible for many bombings in Israel, threatened to avenge his death. A similar Israeli booby trap in 1996 was followed by a wave of suicide bombings. The killing in the West Bank town of Jenin came only hours after Israeli soldiers shot up a convoy carrying a senior Palestinian negotiator, Mohammed Dahlan, back from peace talks. He escaped injury, but one of his bodyguards was shot in the leg and two others were injured when their vehicle overturned. Mr Dahlan, a member of the inner circle of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is the most senior Palestinian yet to be on the receiving end of Israeli fire. The Palestinians claimed it was a botched assassination attempt while the Israelis insisted the Palestinians opened fire first. The Israeli army promised an investigation. After a relatively quiet Wednesday that saw political initiatives from both sides, the hardline Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, resorted to the iron fist yesterday. In addition to the violence that also saw the Israelis kill Ahmed Mahmoud al-Atar, a 15-year-old Palestinian who was throwing stones, the Israeli government threatened to add to the already deteriorating situation by inviting tenders for 700 new houses for Jewish settlers in the predominantly Palestinian West Bank. Israeli peace campaigners condemned the announcement, while the United States called the move provocative and inflammatory. Using language much stronger than in previous statements on Jewish settlements, state department spokesman Richard Boucher said: \"Continuing settlement activity by Israel does risk further inflaming an already volatile situation in the region. \"This is provocative and we have consistently encouraged both sides to refrain from provocative acts.\" The Islamic Jihad commander, Iyad al-Hardan, 25, was killed instantly when the phone exploded after he inserted a phone card. He had been released from a Palestinian Authority prison after the uprising began in September, but was re-arrested by Palestinian police six weeks ago. He was regularly allowed out to make calls. A Palestinian Authority source said: \"Israel is responsible for this assassination operation by putting explosive materials inside the telephone.\" Israeli officials declined to comment but Israeli radio reported that Mr Hardan had been liquidated by the Israeli security forces and that he was responsible for a series of attacks on Israelis. The shooting incident involving Mr Dahlan, who is head of security in Gaza, took place at the Israel-Gaza border as he was returning from talks in Tel Aviv with Israeli security chiefs about renewing joint security arrangements which were ended by the Palestinian uprising. \"This Israeli ambush was another assassination attack against us,\" Mr Dahlan said. Nerves tend to be fraught at the border, especially in the darkness, and soldiers, police and security men on both sides are trigger-happy. An Israeli army spokesman, Lieutenant Olivier Rafowicz, said, following a preliminary investigation, that the Palestinians \"opened fire from the first Jeep, from the back right-hand window and then Israeli soldiers fired back at the source from the Jeep\". He said: \"This [assassination] allegation is childish and baseless. We were sitting with him and other security people to try to resume peace talks. There is no logic [in trying to assassinate him].\" Related articles 05.04.2001: Peres tables peace plan with Palestinians in Athens 04.04.2001: Gaza hit by Israeli backlash 03.04.2001: Israeli helicopter gunships kill Islamic militant in Gaza 02.04.2001: Israelis vow vengeance at baby's funeral 30.3.2001: Arafat defies pressure to call off Palestinian uprising Bomber 'driven mad' by Israelis shelling 29.03.2001: Israelis blast Arafat's HQ 29.03.2001: Comment: Talk of war Useful links Member countries of the Arab League Palestine Times Jordan Times Israeli government Palestinian National Authority",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year, the designer and painter Nicholas Georgiadis, who has died aged 77, reworked one of his most celebrated ballet designs, for Kenneth Macmillan's 1965 production of Romeo And Juliet, at Covent Garden. He abstracted his sumptuous Verona, opening the stage to buoyant romance, while the tragic confinement to the crypt was narrowed down to sharpen the ballet's stark conclusion.</p> <p>However opulent his designs, he always retained the theatrical intelligence that informed his two great collaborative partnerships, with Macmillan and Rudolf Nureyev.</p> <p>Much of Georgiadis's work drew on the past in a grand, even glitzy, style. His first work with Macmillan, Danses Concertantes (1955), suggested a green and blue palace decorated with winged sphinxes. Later productions created fantasias of the courts of Louis XIV or imperial Vienna. Even so, this was never pure escapism. The wealth-dazzled story of Manon was lavishly ornamented, but ragged squalor gnawed at its edges, and provided the setting for the heroine's death.</p> <p>Georgiadis could also capture the austerity of The Song Of The Earth; a claustrophobic room with a naked light bulb, reminiscent of Anne Frank's attic, for The Burrow; or The Invitation, with Edwardian costumes as formal, and a set as gauzy, as the narrative's murky erotics. He layered and grouped costumes to great effect - as in the slumped and dozing courtiers in his Sleeping Beauty - and etched metaphors through individual dresses, marking Manon's amoral progress into embroidered black and gold.</p> <p>Born in Athens, Georgiadis studied painting and architecture in Greece, and at Columbia University, New York. In 1953, he came to London on a scholarship to study at the Slade, and won first prize for stage design, attracting the attention of the Royal Ballet's Ninette de Valois.</p> <p>His collaboration with Macmillan began with the choreographer's first ballet for Sadler's Wells in 1955. Macmillan, who had never previously worked with a designer, was taken by de Valois to the Slade, and chose to work with Georgiadis. Danses Concertantes was succeeded by a vicious Grimm tale, The House Of Birds, in which a beaky witch turned children into birds - played by girls with their heads held in birdcages. The following year saw their first production for the Royal Ballet, the iridescent Noctambules.</p> <p>It was Georgiadis who suggested Lorca's The House Of Bernada Alba to Macmillan, who produced Las Hermanas (Stuttgart, 1963). Here the tormented sisters were contained in a monochrome stone house, shuttered away from sunlight. His Napoleonic-era setting for Swan Lake In Berlin (1969) was inspired by gardens at Villa Lanta, near Spoleto, framed by dark arching trees with thorny branches. Stark, black accents always tempered Georgiadis's splashes of colour, as in the arrow-marked leotards of that early Danses Concertantes.</p> <p>One of his great triumphs was Romeo And Juliet. Macmillan called for a realistic Verona, and Georgiadis responded with a two-tiered set, its marbled arcades linked by steep staircases. Frescoes and angel candelabra carried Byzantine inflections, and the critic Richard Buckle praised the crypt - \"a composition of delicate greys\" - and the subtle mass of costumes, creating a \"browny-pinky-greeny-gold gorgeousness\". It was first performed in 1965, with Margot Fonteyn and Nureyev, and continues to be part of the Royal Ballet repertory.</p> <p>In Mayerling (1978), the claustrophobia of the imperial court was reinforced by ranks of tailor's dummies, keeping the tortured hero under mute surveillance.</p> <p>In 1982, Georgiadis became the first designer to win the London Evening Standard award for outstanding contribution to dance, for his Orpheus and The Tempest. In his dark and gold Orpheus, flickering with candles, Orpheus approached the underworld down gilded ladders. His final production with Macmillan was on Britten's The Prince Of The Pagodas (1989).</p> <p>But it was his creative collaboration with Nureyev that gave Georgiadis's prodigal imagination full rein. Their Sleeping Beauty for La Scala (later performed by London Festival Ballet), was inspired by Louis XIV's Versailles, dark gold and extravagantly tassled. Their Nutcracker for the Royal Ballet was a visual feast seen through a child's eye - Clara's fantasy journey to the kingdom of sweets transporting her to her own toy theatre. Georgiadis designed original ballets by Nureyev, including The Tempest and Washington Square, and several works for the Paris Opera Ballet, including Don Quixote.</p> <p>Georgiadis, who co-founded the Society of British Theatre Designers in 1971, also designed for theatre and opera, particularly works with classical settings. His witty Athenian frontage for Aristophanes's Lysistrata (1957), featuring husky-voiced Joan Greenwood in the early years of the Royal Court, and a skewed arena for Julius Caesar at the Old Vic (1962), were both designed for director Minos Volanakis.</p> <p>In 1978, the Old Vic housed Prospect Theatre's paired productions of Antony And Cleopatra (in high Renaissance plumes) and All For Love (in Restoration dress). His operas included Covent Garden's spectacular Aida and Les Troyens, and among his films was The Trojan Women (1971), starring Katharine Hepburn and Vanessa Redgrave.</p> <p>Soon after leaving the Slade, Georgiadis returned to teach for 30 years; the filmmaker Derek Jarman was among his students. As an artist, he represented Greece at the Venice Biennale. The Welsh Arts Council mounted a retrospective of his theatrical work in 1980, and last year, an exhibition of his figurative paintings appeared at the Hellenic Centre in London.

      "body": "<p>An inquest heard yesterday how two schoolgirls awoke when Caroline Dickinson, 13, was raped and smothered to death in their dormitory of a French youth hostel in 1996 - but though they heard her cry out and struggle, they thought she was having a nightmare.</p> <p>One heard the zip of her sleeping bag being opened, while the other heard groaning. The first saw the murderer get up from Caroline's mattress but, presuming it was the girl herself, took no further notice and fell back to sleep. Two other girls in the room slept throughout.</p> <p>The extent of the girls' unwitting witness of the rape and murder emerged in statements read out at Bodmin coroner's court. The East Cornwall coroner, Edward Carlyon, ruled Caroline had been unlawfully killed, calling her death \"the nightmare every parent dreads\".</p> <p>She and 40 other children had been on a school activity week at Pleine Fougeres in Brittany. An intruder entered their unlocked hostel in the early hours of July 18, 1996.</p> <p>More than 3,500 DNA samples have since been taken by police, and 2,000 lines of enquiry have been followed up, but the killer remains unknown. Yesterday, Francis Denons, the French judge in charge of the investigation, said the search would continue.</p> <p>The inquest heard a summary of evidence from the girls, who were granted anonimity by the coroner, given by Detective Superintendent Andrew Pierce, the Devon and Cornwall officer who has been liaising with the French police.</p> <p>The first girl, in a bottom bunk near Caroline's mattress on the floor, woke in the early hours and was disturbed by a sound she thought was from Caroline.</p> <p>\"It sounded like crying, she glanced over and saw what she thought was her kicking in her sleeping bag. She then heard what she thought was the sound of the zip of her sleeping bag being undone and she concluded Caroline was hot and dreaming... She thought she also saw someone get up from that area and, thinking it was Caroline, she took no further notice,\" Mr Pierce told the inquest.</p> <p>The girl in the bunk above was woken by a noise and \"saw the sleeping bag moving around, and at the same time heard groaning noises\" - but thought it was Caroline having a nightmare.</p> <p>The court also heard from the teacher in charge of the party from Launceston community college. Elizabeth Barker, 56, described how she and a fellow teacher unknowingly laughed and joked on hearing the killer leave the hostel in the middle of the night.</p> <p>She and her colleague, Jackie Thorpe, heard a man's footsteps crunching over gravel and a car driving off at 4.45am - but had thought nothing of it despite Mrs Thorpe being woken by noises three-quarters of an hour earlier.</p> <p>\"I thought Jackie was being nosey, and I told her so,\" she told the court. \"We laughed and joked about how the man who had just left was Manu's [a waiter at the hostel] lover.\"</p> <p>Three and a half hours later, she was called to Caroline's room by her roommates who were unable to wake her. As she rushed to her side, she noticed the zip of her sleeping bag was pulled down and \"a lot of blood on her thighs\". \"Some blood was dry. She was cold and her lips were blue,\" she added.</p> <p>She tried to raise her head up after placing her in the recovery position, but was unable to do so.

      "bodyText": "An inquest heard yesterday how two schoolgirls awoke when Caroline Dickinson, 13, was raped and smothered to death in their dormitory of a French youth hostel in 1996 - but though they heard her cry out and struggle, they thought she was having a nightmare. One heard the zip of her sleeping bag being opened, while the other heard groaning. The first saw the murderer get up from Caroline's mattress but, presuming it was the girl herself, took no further notice and fell back to sleep. Two other girls in the room slept throughout. The extent of the girls' unwitting witness of the rape and murder emerged in statements read out at Bodmin coroner's court. The East Cornwall coroner, Edward Carlyon, ruled Caroline had been unlawfully killed, calling her death \"the nightmare every parent dreads\". She and 40 other children had been on a school activity week at Pleine Fougeres in Brittany. An intruder entered their unlocked hostel in the early hours of July 18, 1996. More than 3,500 DNA samples have since been taken by police, and 2,000 lines of enquiry have been followed up, but the killer remains unknown. Yesterday, Francis Denons, the French judge in charge of the investigation, said the search would continue. The inquest heard a summary of evidence from the girls, who were granted anonimity by the coroner, given by Detective Superintendent Andrew Pierce, the Devon and Cornwall officer who has been liaising with the French police. The first girl, in a bottom bunk near Caroline's mattress on the floor, woke in the early hours and was disturbed by a sound she thought was from Caroline. \"It sounded like crying, she glanced over and saw what she thought was her kicking in her sleeping bag. She then heard what she thought was the sound of the zip of her sleeping bag being undone and she concluded Caroline was hot and dreaming... She thought she also saw someone get up from that area and, thinking it was Caroline, she took no further notice,\" Mr Pierce told the inquest. The girl in the bunk above was woken by a noise and \"saw the sleeping bag moving around, and at the same time heard groaning noises\" - but thought it was Caroline having a nightmare. The court also heard from the teacher in charge of the party from Launceston community college. Elizabeth Barker, 56, described how she and a fellow teacher unknowingly laughed and joked on hearing the killer leave the hostel in the middle of the night. She and her colleague, Jackie Thorpe, heard a man's footsteps crunching over gravel and a car driving off at 4.45am - but had thought nothing of it despite Mrs Thorpe being woken by noises three-quarters of an hour earlier. \"I thought Jackie was being nosey, and I told her so,\" she told the court. \"We laughed and joked about how the man who had just left was Manu's [a waiter at the hostel] lover.\" Three and a half hours later, she was called to Caroline's room by her roommates who were unable to wake her. As she rushed to her side, she noticed the zip of her sleeping bag was pulled down and \"a lot of blood on her thighs\". \"Some blood was dry. She was cold and her lips were blue,\" she added. She tried to raise her head up after placing her in the recovery position, but was unable to do so. Another teacher, who was also a nurse, came in, and told her she was dead. A Home Office pathologist gave a description of how Caroline was suffocated not strangled, after which the coroner ruled: \"A male intruder entered the room that night and assaulted and murdered Caro line. There can be no other conclusion. \"Caroline was the victim of a vicious sexual assault which included her suffocation to prevent her calling for help. After the verdict, Caroline's father, John Dickinson, made a statement on behalf of himself, his ex-wife Sue, and daughter Jenny, 15, calling for a substantial reward to be set up to help catch her killer as well as an integrated European DNA database to help the search for him.

He added: \"The passage of time has done nothing to lessen our sense of devastating loss, and we remain fully committed to seeking justice for a bright, kind and gentle young girl who should now be 18 and enjoying all the opportunities and challenges that life has to offer a young woman of today.\" Timetable 4am, July 18, 1996.

      "bodyText": "The supermarket chain Tesco claimed to have struck a blow for consumers yesterday after the European court of justice appeared to sanction its policy of selling cut-price Levi Strauss jeans obtained via the \"grey market\". Tesco sued the American company in 1998, saying it had repeatedly threatened to take Tesco to court for importing cheap Levi 501 jeans from the US and eastern Europe. A pair of button-down 501 jeans can be bought for \u00a325 in the chain's stores, as against at least \u00a345 in high street shops. Tesco, which adheres to the \"pile it high, sell it cheap\" policy of its founder, Sir Jack Cohen, claims to have saved British consumers \u00a342m since it started selling the jeans. But Levi argues that its premium brand reputation is at stake if any supermarket can sell its products at any prices it wishes. It also asserts that staff selling its jeans need special training, so as to advise customers on how one shade of blue differs from another. However, the court in Luxembourg yesterday referred the long-running case back to the British courts with an overt hint that the final ruling should go in favour of Tesco. In a non-binding opinion expected to be formally endorsed by the court later this year, an advocate general ruled: \"The right to control the initial distribution of goods... is not unlimited in as much as importers [such as Tesco] have interests which merit protection and which must be taken into account.\" Tesco seized on the opinion as vindication of its much trumpeted policy of obtaining sought-after consumer goods through non-official, or \"parallel\", channels. \"It's a great day for British shoppers,\" John Gildersleeve, Tesco's director, proclaimed. \"Today's opinion means we will be able to sell top brands from around the world at the prices our customers want. Brands like Levi have been given a clear message today that their policies to keep prices high will no longer be tolerated in Europe.\" A spokesman for the Hert fordshire-based company said of the opinion: \"It says a company does not have unlimited trademark rights. \"And if it is left to the national courts to decide, they will back us because there is a lot of support for what we are doing.\" Levi, however, took advantage of the extraordinarily complex wording of the opinion to argue that the case was going its way. \"Trademark owners have the right, according to the advocate general, to control the import... of their branded products unless they have waived that right,\" said Alan Christie, vice president of public affairs. A spokesman said the decision was \"the exact opposite\" of Tesco's interpretation. But sources close to the court confirmed to the Guardian yesterday that the opinion \"would seem to suggest that the case will go in Tesco's favour,\" but cautioned that there were no guarantees in this nebulous area of law. Tesco claims that big name brands such as Levi, Nike and Adidas have consistently refused to sell to the supermarket, so it is forced to scour cheaper markets in Europe and elsewhere to give customers what they want. Before Christmas it got hold of 2,500 Sony Playstation 2 consoles - unavailable via official channels at that time - and sold them at the recommended retail price. The Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday that Tesco's dispute with Levi showed there was a need to revise EU trademark legislation.",

When Stephen Byers published his two reports that we commissioned on this project in December 1999, he made it clear that before a decision is made, we would need to be satisfied on a number of conditions: (i) the need for proper consultation on resettlement; (ii) maintaining water quality; (iii) assurance that water flow to downstream states will be maintained; and (iv) the preservation of as much of the archaeological heritage of Hasankeyf as possible. If these conditions are not satisfied, then there will be no support. By setting these conditions, we are abiding by recognised minimum standards. Richard Caborn MP Minister for trade",

And, while I wouldn't claim any credit for Leeds' fantastic victory over Deportivo La Coruna, I'm glad he did what we chatted about. </p> <p>I said to David that I hoped his team wouldn't try to become too sophisticated in Europe because part of the reason for their great results has been their naivety. All through the Champions League they have played with no fear and that was obvious again on Wednesday night. </p> <p>Some of the experienced teams might prefer a patient game, putting a number of passes together and playing a lot in their own half. But I think Leeds will lose a lot if they start doing that and it was good to see them playing quickly and accurately and getting plenty of ball into their front pair. </p> <p>Just like Valencia last season they are going into matches without the pressure of expectancy and their performances make you wonder whether it hasn't quite hit them yet how important it all is. </p> <p>Manchester United are well aware of the competition's significance because they have been there and won it and are expected by a lot of people, including themselves, to win it again. That may inhibit them to a certain extent, whereas Leeds have no inhibitions at all. </p> <p>In some ways they remind me of my first experience in Europe with West Brom.

      "bodyText": "I was talking to David O'Leary a couple of weeks ago when we found ourselves together in Dubai. And, while I wouldn't claim any credit for Leeds' fantastic victory over Deportivo La Coruna, I'm glad he did what we chatted about. I said to David that I hoped his team wouldn't try to become too sophisticated in Europe because part of the reason for their great results has been their naivety. All through the Champions League they have played with no fear and that was obvious again on Wednesday night. Some of the experienced teams might prefer a patient game, putting a number of passes together and playing a lot in their own half. But I think Leeds will lose a lot if they start doing that and it was good to see them playing quickly and accurately and getting plenty of ball into their front pair. Just like Valencia last season they are going into matches without the pressure of expectancy and their performances make you wonder whether it hasn't quite hit them yet how important it all is. Manchester United are well aware of the competition's significance because they have been there and won it and are expected by a lot of people, including themselves, to win it again. That may inhibit them to a certain extent, whereas Leeds have no inhibitions at all. In some ways they remind me of my first experience in Europe with West Brom. We had a very attack-minded side with lots of pace and never approached those Uefa Cup games in the traditional manner. We used to go at everybody home and away, and that was one of the beauties of that. We paid some attention to the opposition but not over-much. The danger for Leeds may be if things suddenly hit them, as it seemed to Valencia in the final against Real Madrid last May, but there are no signs of that so far. They have deserved this success because their European performances have been superb. They have been exciting and they've played with a lot of verve and aggression. Deportivo were clearly terrified of Leeds every time there was some physical confrontation. Olivier Dacourt won about five tackles in the first two or three minutes and that set the tone. It got everyone around him gingered up, the adrenalin started flowing and after that it was hard to find a Leeds player you couldn't have made star man. They're in a great position now but, make no mistake, Deportivo La Coruna will be better in the return. They were very disappointing on Wednesday, though it would be nice to think much of that was down to Leeds' pace, drive and tempo. All the same O'Leary will have seen enough in the last 15 minutes, when La Coruna went a bit more attack-minded and Valeron came on and started playing well, to know that, if his players are not bang on their mettle, things could go against them. Djalminha didn't have much of a game but I'm sure he'll have far more of an influence in La Coruna. He might be a hot-head but he's a fine player and I tried to sign him once when I was at Sheffield Wednesday. We had a meeting in France during the Tournoi in the lead-up to the 1998 World Cup.
