      "body": "<p>The impression is that nothing changes in cricket, that it is permanently stuck in the mud. At international level this is obviously nonsense. There have been major changes in the last decade and there are more to come. Sometimes the speed of that change has been surprising.</p> <p>A decade ago I was asked to concoct a piece on the year 2000 by The Cricketer magazine. Some of the predictions were on target, though the elevation of Mr Mark Nicholas to the post of Chairman of Selectors seems to be taking slightly longer than anticipated. I was emphatically wrong on two issues; the introduction of women to the MCC and - maybe more importantly - the return of South Africa to the cricketing fold. I assumed that neither would take place until beyond 2000.</p> <p>The international cricketing community will continue to expand. In the nineties back came South Africa and Zimbabwe were introduced; in this decade expect Bangladesh to secure full Test status; maybe Kenya will follow. England have always been wary of widening the base of international cricket as their attitude to the latest arrivals, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, betrays, but they can hardly object now. Recently the England team have been unable to beat either of these sides. They could do with some opponents that are obviously inferior especially since New Zealand no longer come into this category.</p> <p>With more teams the international schedule will have to be rationalised. As the globe shrinks tours will become shorter; the Ashes series will last in its present format longer than most but my guess is that by 2010 it will no longer be played over five Tests. Some form of league table for Test cricket will be adopted with the top two sides playing a final every one or two years.</p> <p>However it is international one day cricket that needs urgent attention. Countless, haphazard fixtures take place each year from Sharjah to Toronto. Except when the matches are part of a World Cup no one cares a jot who wins them, which leaves the way open to all sorts of skulduggery. A competitive structure for one day cricket needs to be established, also incorporating league tables, to augment the World Cup.</p> <p>The marriage between TV and cricket will continue to be prickly but essential for the survival of the game. The players may crave privacy on the field and in the dressing room; the directors will want to stick microphones and cameras in every possible cranny. Modern technology will enlarge the role of the third umpire. The two umpires out in the middle will phone their friend ever more frequently, checking whether the ball pitched outside the line of leg stump or whether an edge is discernible.

      "bodyText": "The impression is that nothing changes in cricket, that it is permanently stuck in the mud. At international level this is obviously nonsense. There have been major changes in the last decade and there are more to come. Sometimes the speed of that change has been surprising. A decade ago I was asked to concoct a piece on the year 2000 by The Cricketer magazine. Some of the predictions were on target, though the elevation of Mr Mark Nicholas to the post of Chairman of Selectors seems to be taking slightly longer than anticipated. I was emphatically wrong on two issues; the introduction of women to the MCC and - maybe more importantly - the return of South Africa to the cricketing fold. I assumed that neither would take place until beyond 2000. The international cricketing community will continue to expand. In the nineties back came South Africa and Zimbabwe were introduced; in this decade expect Bangladesh to secure full Test status; maybe Kenya will follow. England have always been wary of widening the base of international cricket as their attitude to the latest arrivals, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, betrays, but they can hardly object now. Recently the England team have been unable to beat either of these sides. They could do with some opponents that are obviously inferior especially since New Zealand no longer come into this category. With more teams the international schedule will have to be rationalised. As the globe shrinks tours will become shorter; the Ashes series will last in its present format longer than most but my guess is that by 2010 it will no longer be played over five Tests. Some form of league table for Test cricket will be adopted with the top two sides playing a final every one or two years. However it is international one day cricket that needs urgent attention. Countless, haphazard fixtures take place each year from Sharjah to Toronto. Except when the matches are part of a World Cup no one cares a jot who wins them, which leaves the way open to all sorts of skulduggery. A competitive structure for one day cricket needs to be established, also incorporating league tables, to augment the World Cup. The marriage between TV and cricket will continue to be prickly but essential for the survival of the game. The players may crave privacy on the field and in the dressing room; the directors will want to stick microphones and cameras in every possible cranny. Modern technology will enlarge the role of the third umpire. The two umpires out in the middle will phone their friend ever more frequently, checking whether the ball pitched outside the line of leg stump or whether an edge is discernible. But they not the third umpire should be the final arbiter. Mistakes will be reduced but there will be no shortage of controversy. At home the cynics will have it that 18 teams will still be battling away in the equivalent of the Benson and Hedges Cup in April 2010, so intransigent are the counties. Those in the shires argue that they have actually compromised significantly in the last decade: they have accepted four day cricket and two divisional cricket as well as pouring money into their academies as encouraged by the ECB. Will there still be 18 counties? It's odd. Just about everyone agrees that there are too many sides yet in 2000 there is one more first-class outfit than in 1990 with Durham's elevation in 1992.

      "body": "<p>He is accepted now even by the doubters - and my goodness there have been plenty of those. Even before he took seven for 46 in the first innings of the Durban Test, Andrew Caddick had established himself as an integral part of this England side. Pecking orders are not to be encouraged in pursuit of team unity, but the simple fact is that Caddick has superseded Darren Gough and all the others. He is now recognised as England's most reliable bowler, the cornerstone of the attack.</p> <p>In the first two Tests in South Africa, he had taken only four wickets, yet still not even the doubters were complaining. He had bowled OK - with plenty of spirit and perseverance and not much luck. He was patently 100 per cent committed. The signs were obvious even when he wasn't bowling. There was that stunning catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis at Port Elizabeth as he forced his giraffe-like frame to hurl itself to the ground so that he could emerge triumphant with the ball in his right hand; there were a couple of doughty knocks with the bat when he stood up to Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock.</p> <p>Of course I've always maintained that he has been 100 per cent committed, but I've usually found myself in the minority. At Somerset there has been constant bafflement over the past few years that the England hierarchy should have questioned his attitude. To take 350 first-class wickets in the past four English seasons requires heart as well as talent. If confirmation were required you only had to be at Taunton last September at the end of a long, long season for Caddick.</p> <p>Against Lancashire he bowled 35 overs in the day, taking eight for 113. He would not have bothered if we believed some of the criticisms levelled against him over the years. His tour place was already secured; his reputation restored, yet it was impossible for the captain, Jamie Cox, to wrench the ball out of his hand - not that he wanted to. Wicketkeeper Rob Turner said he was bowling faster at 5pm than at 11am. The rhythm was with him so he just wanted to keep going. Caddick prefers bowling to fielding.</p> <p>Successive Somerset captains have treasured him; not all have liked him greatly, but they recognised that he was their match-winner.Yet throughout most of his England career he has been treated with suspicion in the press box and the dressing room. Until the elevation of Nasser Hussain, all his England captains have had reservations. Graham Gooch was probably wary of his birthplace - Christchurch, New Zealand. Gooch misguidedly set so much store by anthem and flag. He struggled to accept anyone born outside the country playing for England and queried their commitment - although this did not deter him from popping off to South Africa in the early Eighties.</p> <p>Mike Atherton, at least, picked him more often than not, although by his own admission he often struggled to get through to him. Atherton was always incapable of hiding any doubts he felt about players in his side and he clearly had a few about Caddick. Alec Stewart did not pick him at all when he was captain. Indeed, Caddick's omission from the tour party to Australia last winter, after he had taken 105 first-class wickets for Somerset in 1998, was one of the most scandalous non-selections of the decade.</p> <p>Stewart - despite the fact that he embraces him oh so warmly when Caddick conjures an outside edge into the wicketkeeper's gloves - has to bear responsibility for this (he also declined ever to pick Phil Tufnell, who at least had some form as a troublemaker, unlike Caddick). But the other selectors were culpable as well. One of their duties is to quietly point out when their captain is adopting the most blinkered and self-destructive of policies. Steve Waugh, dismissed five times by Caddick in his Test career, could not believe his luck.</p> <p>Hussain is brighter and immediately brought Caddick back last summer for the series against New Zealand. I suspect that he could identify with Caddick's predicament easily. Like Caddick, Hussain has never been regarded as clubbable. He too had spent a long time exiled from the England team because he didn't quite fit in; too self-obsessed, not an obvious team man. </p> <p>It is alarming how easily judgments can be swayed by personality rather than ability. I remember joining the tour to Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 1996-97 and being stunned to hear that sages from Ian Botham downwards regarded Chris Silverwood to be a better prospect than Caddick. Silverwood was patently whole-hearted, a superb trier, an eager listener (he still is); Caddick was distant, seemingly aloof, reluctant to take advice... but obviously the better bowler. If Silverwood had not been injured before the penultimate Test of that tour, Caddick might not have played at all during that winter.</p> <p>It is also true that Caddick has not always helped himself. On his first overseas trip to the Caribbean, he managed to disenchant a chunk of the press corps by his aloofness (he scarcely knew any of them) and by the fact that he kept wandering into the press box to use their phones. He can be gauche, and has the capacity to put his foot in his mouth. On a subsequent tour to the West Indies, he naively asserted that he knew how to get Lara out. His comments rebounded on him when he failed to take a wicket in the ensuing Trinidad Test on a seamer's paradise. He has sometimes frozen out in the middle when assaulted by the likes of Lara, which was the case in Port of Spain. Afterwards he was reluctant to concede that he had bowled poorly. This was interpreted as arrogance; those closer to him argued that he did not have the self-confidence to admit to his frailties.</p> <p>Peter Anderson, the chief executive at Somerset, knows him better than most. He has employed him for over a decade as a pace bowler and in the early days as a Mr Fixit in the maintenance department during the winter months. He says: 'Andrew is not a natural social mixer with people he doesn't really know. He can appear to be abrupt and abrasive, but that is purely a natural reaction born out of inherent shyness. There is not an evil intent in his body.'</p> <p>Moreover, he has matured since those early days. He accepted his omission during the Stewart regime with remarkable phlegm. He tinkered with his bowling; there was a technical adjustment to be made as he entered his delivery stride and he refined his strategy. He placed more emphasis on accuracy and patience. Now confident that the wickets would eventually come, he stopped straining for those unplayable deliveries. He didn't worry too much about the pundits yearning for him to bowl two feet fuller in length.</p> <p>Most importantly, he discovered an England captain, who has absolute confidence in him. Both these 31-year-olds are determined to make up for lost time. Hussain now has 2,918 Test runs; he should have 4,000. Caddick has 106 Test wickets; he should have 150. In the past their talents have been wasted. Now, at least, they are universally appreciated. About time, too.</p>",

Put simply, Klusener bowls at slow-medium and cannot get the ball off straight. He cannot be classed as an all-rounder now.</p> <p>Jacques Kallis is working his way back to form after injury and is far short of his incisive best. Adams is bowling well and adds a different dimension to the attack, but the one truly fast bowler who has unsettled all the England upper order, Hayward, has no place here in Cape Town.</p> <p>When Hayward plays it does not matter if Kallis and Klusener prove ineffective with the ball, and to have Rhodes in the side and batting at six seems to act as a collective security blanket.</p> <p>Most combinations have been explored, bar one. To leave out the captain. Cronje is batting poorly, averaging just 20 in the series, and should not hold his batting place. Originally chosen as captain for the first two Tests, the selectors then backtracked and made him captain for all five. As they chop and change for each Test, they may well be ruing that decision already.</p>",

But first the national blinkers have to come off when the South Africans assess their bowling strength. Clearly Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock are fine bowlers, but despite his sterling work yesterday Donald is some way short of his best and Pollock is not taking wickets at the rate he would like. Lance Klusener is a bowler no longer - he has not taken a wicket in the series - and judgment of his worth is being seriously clouded by his marvellous batting record. Put simply, Klusener bowls at slow-medium and cannot get the ball off straight. He cannot be classed as an all-rounder now. Jacques Kallis is working his way back to form after injury and is far short of his incisive best. Adams is bowling well and adds a different dimension to the attack, but the one truly fast bowler who has unsettled all the England upper order, Hayward, has no place here in Cape Town. When Hayward plays it does not matter if Kallis and Klusener prove ineffective with the ball, and to have Rhodes in the side and batting at six seems to act as a collective security blanket. Most combinations have been explored, bar one. To leave out the captain. Cronje is batting poorly, averaging just 20 in the series, and should not hold his batting place. Originally chosen as captain for the first two Tests, the selectors then backtracked and made him captain for all five. As they chop and change for each Test, they may well be ruing that decision already.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Rest of the World</strong><br> I'm handicapped by my youth when picking this team. I notice that there is only one player who performed before the Second World War. </p> <p>There's no Headley, Trumper or McCabe. There are no giants from the Fifties either: no three Ws, no Lindwall or Miller, no Hanif. Indeed no Pakistanis at all, which is odd. So it is a young side; it should outfield the opposition; it might outbat and outbowl them as well. </p> <p>It's youth may also reflect the fact cricket and cricketers outside England have improved far more rapidly over the past 30 years than those within our shores. It's taken a while for the English cricketing establishment to recognise this fact, but I think it's beginning to sink in. </p> <p>I have had to bat Sachin Tendulkar out of position. There were handy specialist openers available, but the prospect of contrasting and comparing the two little Indian geniuses at work was irresistible. Having seen Tendulkar play at the age of 15, Gavaskar predicted that he would break all of his records. He may still be right. </p> <p>Viv Richards was the greatest batsman I played with or against. Don Bradman and Gary Sobers are inked into these types of eleven without blinking wherever you live, which leaves just one batting place to be filled. </p> <p>In Karachi they might pick Javed Miandad; in Colombo Aravinda de Silva; in Adelaide Greg Chappell; in Sydney Allan Border or Steve Waugh; in Port of Spain Brian Lara. But it's hard to argue against Graeme Pollock (Test average of nearly 61, second only to Bradman, and a reasonably entertaining player to boot). </p> <p>The presence of Rodney Marsh may not be obvious, but we need an Observer man there and he has a better chance than most of keeping Dennis Lillee in order. The wicket-keeping position could have been taken up by any number of Australians and the West Indies keeper, Jeff Dujon may have been a genius standing up to the stumps.. in the Eighties we never had a chance to find out. </p> <p>Shane Warne is the best slow bowler I've ever seen and deserves a slot, if only because he's revolutionised the modern game. The arrival of Warne upturned the premise, sparked by the superiority of the West Indies in the Eighties, that pace and pace alone was the way to dominate world cricket.

      "bodyText": "Rest of the World I'm handicapped by my youth when picking this team. I notice that there is only one player who performed before the Second World War. There's no Headley, Trumper or McCabe. There are no giants from the Fifties either: no three Ws, no Lindwall or Miller, no Hanif. Indeed no Pakistanis at all, which is odd. So it is a young side; it should outfield the opposition; it might outbat and outbowl them as well. It's youth may also reflect the fact cricket and cricketers outside England have improved far more rapidly over the past 30 years than those within our shores. It's taken a while for the English cricketing establishment to recognise this fact, but I think it's beginning to sink in. I have had to bat Sachin Tendulkar out of position. There were handy specialist openers available, but the prospect of contrasting and comparing the two little Indian geniuses at work was irresistible. Having seen Tendulkar play at the age of 15, Gavaskar predicted that he would break all of his records. He may still be right. Viv Richards was the greatest batsman I played with or against. Don Bradman and Gary Sobers are inked into these types of eleven without blinking wherever you live, which leaves just one batting place to be filled. In Karachi they might pick Javed Miandad; in Colombo Aravinda de Silva; in Adelaide Greg Chappell; in Sydney Allan Border or Steve Waugh; in Port of Spain Brian Lara. But it's hard to argue against Graeme Pollock (Test average of nearly 61, second only to Bradman, and a reasonably entertaining player to boot). The presence of Rodney Marsh may not be obvious, but we need an Observer man there and he has a better chance than most of keeping Dennis Lillee in order. The wicket-keeping position could have been taken up by any number of Australians and the West Indies keeper, Jeff Dujon may have been a genius standing up to the stumps.. in the Eighties we never had a chance to find out. Shane Warne is the best slow bowler I've ever seen and deserves a slot, if only because he's revolutionised the modern game. The arrival of Warne upturned the premise, sparked by the superiority of the West Indies in the Eighties, that pace and pace alone was the way to dominate world cricket. Even so, I'm happy to pick Lillee and Marshall. The manager will be Frank Worrell. If he could manage to unify the West Indian team four decades ago amid all kinds of divisions and prejudices, looking after this eleven will be a breeze. It should be a good game. I think the Rest of the World will win.

      "body": "<p>The young Spurs fan was inconsolable and for once, ironically, it was due to his ordinary team having done something right. The boy's crime had been to leap up with delight as Tim Sherwood scored at Villa Park on Wednesday night and the volley of foul language he received from a home supporter terrified him into tears. </p> <p>The Aston Villa steward did his best to find the boy and his father other seats among the many decent local people around him but by now, half-time, he just wanted to go home. Some Christmas present, a trip to a Premiership game. Welcome to the reality of verbal violence mostly masked by the gloss and glamour that comes through a television screen. </p> <p>Hooliganism may all but have departed stadiums, driven out by the emergence of closed circuit TV to edge-of-town locations for organised bundles, but so grateful are we for the general lack of physical aggro that it seems we will tolerate pretty much any form of anti-social behaviour as long as we escape unhurt. </p> <p>The result is an often unpleasant experience where exhibitionist displays of sewer-mouthed laddishness at best embarrass sons and their fathers, at worst cause them to leave and re-consider returning. The worst elements among the modern English fan are assuming an arrogance and power that is damaging the game's well-being by driving out the right-minded. </p> <p>This season the chants directed at David Beckham, Alan Shearer, David Ginola et al have become more vicious and bilious, given credence by their publication in football magazines rapdily going downmarket in an attempt to prise beer money out of the lads. The right to shout and criticise comes with the admission money, naturally; the right to eff and blind should not. </p> <p>Then at St James' Park recently, some fans apparently took exception to Ginola responding to abuse with a gesture and reported him to police. It is remarkable how people dishing it out suddenly become so easily shrinking-violet shockable. What recourse is open to Ginola? We may not be far from a player pressing charges against a fan. </p> <p>Not that things are too much better at White Hart Lane, it should be said. In common with the other London grounds, it can be a cockpit of hate. My nine-year-old son is a Tottenham supporter but you find yourself picking and choosing games. Such as Manchester United and Arsenal are going to be filled and fuelled with resentment and the angry faces and mouthes intimidate him. </p> <p>Once, buying a seat meant you would not encounter the excesses. If it offended you in the standing areas, you simply walked to another spot. </p> <p>In these all-seated days, there is little chance of escape. The leery climate is just so widespread. Imagine buying your season ticket and turning up on opening day to find that the bloke next to you is a bigot with a big gob. It must be the same feeling as getting on a train at Newcastle and finding that the only seat left is in the middle of a group of away supporters from London. </p> <p>Gone, it sometimes seems, is the wit that once enhanced the watching experience. These are brasher, less respectful days with a backlash of envy at players who earn lottery jackpots then don't deliver. Egged on by voracious media, certain fans, and groups of them, have assumed as a result a self-importance above their station. </p> <p>A week ago, for example, a representative of some 'independent' Spurs supporters organisation was calling for those who travelled to see the 6-1 defeat at Newcastle to be re-imbursed due to the ineptitude of the team. Surely fans accept that such an outcome is part of the spontaneous possibility of following a club? Should Tottenham then have imposed a levy for the 4-0 win over Watford a few days later? </p> <p>It was an example of how too much importance is attached to knee-jerk, ill-informed comment from minority interests now. The Football Supporters' Association, for example, barely represent one in 100 fans, but are constantly quoted. The much bigger National Federation of Supporters' Clubs are rarely heard from because they are more moderate. Radio phone-ins, a huge growth industry over the instant-gratification last decade, feed and rely on it. On a car journey back from, say Birmingham, after a game, you can be shaking your head from Sparkbrook to Scratchwood, with perhaps just a nod of agreement near Northampton. One solution is for constructive, rational people to pick up the phone for a change. </p> <p>And what of solutions within grounds? One, at the very least, must be to enforce those signs warning about people using foul language being ejected rather than simply paying lip-service to them. It falls also to us to support the brave, decent man who confronts a lout. </p> <p>Otherwise the horrendous snarling image of the Englishman abroad will prevail - and it is noticable probably only in some Germans among other nations at major tournaments- and the country will deservedly lose the chance to host a World Cup. </p> <p>Lose a generation of kids who actually attend, too, as the issue of what they might be subjected to, rather than the cost of going to a game, is most pressing for a parent. Instead, they will simply watch on TV. And while that may sound fine for the merchants of sbscription, in the long-term TV will not want a backdrop of empty seats. </p> <p>Football ignores at its peril any symptom of the falling gates we have seen this season, remembering that bust has followed boom before. It has done much to clean up on the field. For our kids' sakes, it is time to clean up off it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The young Spurs fan was inconsolable and for once, ironically, it was due to his ordinary team having done something right. The boy's crime had been to leap up with delight as Tim Sherwood scored at Villa Park on Wednesday night and the volley of foul language he received from a home supporter terrified him into tears. The Aston Villa steward did his best to find the boy and his father other seats among the many decent local people around him but by now, half-time, he just wanted to go home. Some Christmas present, a trip to a Premiership game. Welcome to the reality of verbal violence mostly masked by the gloss and glamour that comes through a television screen. Hooliganism may all but have departed stadiums, driven out by the emergence of closed circuit TV to edge-of-town locations for organised bundles, but so grateful are we for the general lack of physical aggro that it seems we will tolerate pretty much any form of anti-social behaviour as long as we escape unhurt. The result is an often unpleasant experience where exhibitionist displays of sewer-mouthed laddishness at best embarrass sons and their fathers, at worst cause them to leave and re-consider returning. The worst elements among the modern English fan are assuming an arrogance and power that is damaging the game's well-being by driving out the right-minded. This season the chants directed at David Beckham, Alan Shearer, David Ginola et al have become more vicious and bilious, given credence by their publication in football magazines rapdily going downmarket in an attempt to prise beer money out of the lads. The right to shout and criticise comes with the admission money, naturally; the right to eff and blind should not. Then at St James' Park recently, some fans apparently took exception to Ginola responding to abuse with a gesture and reported him to police. It is remarkable how people dishing it out suddenly become so easily shrinking-violet shockable. What recourse is open to Ginola? We may not be far from a player pressing charges against a fan. Not that things are too much better at White Hart Lane, it should be said. In common with the other London grounds, it can be a cockpit of hate. My nine-year-old son is a Tottenham supporter but you find yourself picking and choosing games. Such as Manchester United and Arsenal are going to be filled and fuelled with resentment and the angry faces and mouthes intimidate him. Once, buying a seat meant you would not encounter the excesses. If it offended you in the standing areas, you simply walked to another spot. In these all-seated days, there is little chance of escape. The leery climate is just so widespread. Imagine buying your season ticket and turning up on opening day to find that the bloke next to you is a bigot with a big gob. It must be the same feeling as getting on a train at Newcastle and finding that the only seat left is in the middle of a group of away supporters from London. Gone, it sometimes seems, is the wit that once enhanced the watching experience. These are brasher, less respectful days with a backlash of envy at players who earn lottery jackpots then don't deliver. Egged on by voracious media, certain fans, and groups of them, have assumed as a result a self-importance above their station. A week ago, for example, a representative of some 'independent' Spurs supporters organisation was calling for those who travelled to see the 6-1 defeat at Newcastle to be re-imbursed due to the ineptitude of the team. Surely fans accept that such an outcome is part of the spontaneous possibility of following a club? Should Tottenham then have imposed a levy for the 4-0 win over Watford a few days later? It was an example of how too much importance is attached to knee-jerk, ill-informed comment from minority interests now. The Football Supporters' Association, for example, barely represent one in 100 fans, but are constantly quoted. The much bigger National Federation of Supporters' Clubs are rarely heard from because they are more moderate. Radio phone-ins, a huge growth industry over the instant-gratification last decade, feed and rely on it. On a car journey back from, say Birmingham, after a game, you can be shaking your head from Sparkbrook to Scratchwood, with perhaps just a nod of agreement near Northampton. One solution is for constructive, rational people to pick up the phone for a change. And what of solutions within grounds? One, at the very least, must be to enforce those signs warning about people using foul language being ejected rather than simply paying lip-service to them. It falls also to us to support the brave, decent man who confronts a lout. Otherwise the horrendous snarling image of the Englishman abroad will prevail - and it is noticable probably only in some Germans among other nations at major tournaments- and the country will deservedly lose the chance to host a World Cup. Lose a generation of kids who actually attend, too, as the issue of what they might be subjected to, rather than the cost of going to a game, is most pressing for a parent. Instead, they will simply watch on TV. And while that may sound fine for the merchants of sbscription, in the long-term TV will not want a backdrop of empty seats. Football ignores at its peril any symptom of the falling gates we have seen this season, remembering that bust has followed boom before. It has done much to clean up on the field. For our kids' sakes, it is time to clean up off it.",

      "body": "<p>Kevin Spacey is about to take a vacation, his first in nearly two years. Three days after closing on Broadway in his acclaimed revival of Eugene O'Neill's four and a half hour marathon The Iceman Cometh, he bounces into one of his favourite Los Angeles haunts, a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard he would rather remained nameless, a place to meet and greet and hang out, where the waitresses know him by his first name and he enjoys them well enough to be inclined to joke and flirt. </p> <p>'Make me one of those iced, swirly, frothy frappuccino mocha things,' he says to a young woman dressed modishly in black. 'What? What? Why do I make you laugh so much?' he says in a soft, deadpan voice, because she does, indeed, seem to be giggling, helplessly. 'Am I so funny?' </p> <p>This is not at all the Spacey we know from his various screen personae: the creepy, criminal mastermind Keyser Soze masquerading as a whining gimp in The Usual Suspects (a turn for which he won an Oscar in 1995), the demented serial killer who outwits both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman (two guys who usually never lose) in Seven, the bitter loser squabbling and sniping with Judy Davis in The Ref, or supercilious, faggy murderer Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In the flesh, Spacey is much more high-energy and high-spirited and odd. </p> <p>He is wearing sharp black trousers and a crisp, white, button-down shirt with a Pentel pen in the pocket. With his round, almost anonymous face, he looks both bland and groomed, like an accountant about to take a vacation, except for the black baseball cap that says 'NYU Film'. Which is to say that Spacey does not at first strike you as an actor at all - a considerable irony, because he is the consummate actor of his generation, an actor right down to the fibre of his no doubt immaculate cotton socks. </p> <p>He moves with Japanese neatness and almost feline delicacy. He has a scar above the lid of his left eye, the result of an altercation with a cat named Prince Albert when he was growing up just over the hill from here, in the San Fernando Valley. </p> <p>Spacey takes gum from his mouth, places it with exquisite deliberation in the centre of a spotless white ashtray and eagerly hits the mark about his new movie American Beauty, co-starring Annette Bening and directed by first-timer Sam Mendes (the young English director whose work for the stage includes the recent London and New York runs of Cabaret and The Blue Room ). American Beauty is the buzz film, having been described by Steven Spielberg as the best thing he has seen in years, and a reminder of why he himself wants to make movies - giddy praise indeed, even if Spielberg's Dreamworks company did produce the picture. </p> <p>In talking about American Beauty, for once it is right to use superlatives. This film is howlingly funny, but not a comedy. It ends tragically, yet reminds us of the beauty of life. It centres on the disintegration and renaissance of an executive, Lester Burnham (Spacey), and his relationship with his wife (Bening, who lets rip in ways both hilarious and terrifying). Although Lester whacks off in the shower, lusts and drools over his daughter's sultry best friend and blackmails his boss when he is fired, the film concerns itself as much with suburban morality and teenage angst as it does with the male menopause. </p> <p>American Beauty will, I think, quickly find itself in the category of masterpieces such as The Graduate, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Ordinary People. It is emotionally spacious, perfectly modulated and seems likely to redefine Spacey's career and kick it on to another level. </p> <p>'Kevin has been pigeonholed as a Machiavelli, the cleverest man on screen,' says Mendes. 'Here he plays a man who's blind to the world and outrageous and foolish and charming by turn. This is a very different part for him because audiences can love his character while being shocked by what he does. I think Kevin realised right from the start how big a moment this would be in his career if it worked.' </p> <p>In the restaurant, Spacey removes his baseball cap, revealing thinning black hair. At 39, he conducts himself with the relaxed confidence of a man quite aware of the fact that he's really hitting his stride these days. 'People tend to want you the way they discovered you, and I got dissolved in very dark parts. It's been the greatest thing in the world to me when I've heard people say about American Beauty, \"I never thought he could do this.\" Well, I can do it and I've been trying to tell people for years.' </p> <p>He first read TV comedy writer Alan Ball's screenplay in the summer of 1998, when he was still playing in Iceman in London. 'I knew that it was sensational, ahead of its time on so many levels that are relevant to the world we find ourselves in as we walk into the millennium. To me, the whole film is about perception and how easy it is to misperceive or to perceive only what you care to perceive. People ask, \"How does a thing like Columbine, Colorado, happen?\" I think this movie answers that question. It's right there in front of us. There are usually unnoticed goings- on between families and neighbours and co-workers that are subterranean truths once you examine them.' </p> <p>At which point Spacey, examining me examining his tongue nervously fretting at his lip, excuses himself and bolts out to his car to apply something to an area that, he tells me, got burned windsailing. Keyser Soze windsailing? Kevin Spacey, the Valley boy turned Julliard graduate and archetypal New York theatre figure windsailing? It does not seem to fit, but then for years journalists have been trying to work out who Spacey really is. </p> <p>There's the mysterious issue of his real name, for instance - Kevin Fowler. Where does the Spacey come from? He is not letting on, and Internet speculation is rife. The game took an unpleasant turn a couple of years back when a magazine article centred itself on another rumour, that Spacey is gay. He bounds back up the stairs from the car park and sits again, lip duly salved. I ask what impact the piece had had on him and his career. </p> <p>He accepts the question graciously but becomes animated, leaning back in his chair and waving his arms, as though the memory - whatever he may say to the contrary - stings. 'It didn't impact on me at all. It had nothing to do with me. People say they're appalled about my private life being dragged through the pages of a magazine. I was laughing with Ed Norton about this recently, because my private life wasn't put out there at all. My private life was intact. That was just presumption, rumour, based on nothing. </p> <p>'If you come to me and say, I hear you're a bigot, I hear you're a paedophile, I hear you cheat on your taxes, you bet your ass I'd stand up and defend myself because those are things I don't want to be associated with and I find reprehensible. But what's wrong with gay people? Why should I be pressed to stand up and say I'm not one of them?' </p> <p>Spacey may choose not to take journalists on a personal journey of his experience, but when you meet him, he is much funnier and more intimate than expected. After acting in high school, and while he was at Julliard, he began his professional career as a stand-up comedian, doing impressions. During the lunch, chatting away, picking at the salmon he has ordered from the still giggling waitress, his voice takes on the tones of some of those he has admired or met or worked with. In front of my eyes, he becomes Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, John Gielgud, Danny DeVito, Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. </p> <p>These last two have become his career guides, as well as close friends. He still has the photograph Lemmon signed for him as a child, and it was Pacino who gave him his first big break in the movies in Glengarry Glenross and later invited him to be his co-conspirator in the Shakespeare documentary Looking for Richard. Spacey both acted in the film and tagged along for the ride, sitting off camera while Pacino conducted his interviews with scores of noted academics, directors and actors. Now he speaks of both Lemmon and Pacino with a humour and warmth that borders on veneration, giving a glimpse of the Spacey who once was, and to some extent still is, the nerdiest of theatre fans. </p> <p>It occurs to me, putting aside all consideration of who he is as a private indi vidual, that this is who Kevin Spacey is becoming as an actor - a shotgun marriage of two great performers and stars who seem, on the face of it, improbable bedfellows - Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. </p> <p>'He's a strategist as an actor and, like Lemmon, he doesn't look like a film star,' agrees Mendes. 'While we were shooting American Beauty , we talked a lot about The Apartment and the way Lemmon made that character so real and normal, right down to the way his hair changed through the course of the movie - becoming both more and more distressed and yet more and more true to his inner self. Kevin's concentration is like a laser beam. And like Pacino, you always feel certain he's going to find those moments that will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.' </p> <p>Spacey has worked extremely hard during these past two years, turning his career in this new direction that seems to fit so well. In between productions of Iceman in London and New York (where he lives with his dog in a small Greenwich Village apartment), he shot three movies back to back - American Beauty, Ordinary Decent Criminal , based on the life of Irish gangster Martin Cahill, and The Big Kahuna , produced by his own Trigger Street Productions, a $2 million movie about two salesmen, in which he stars with a pal from LA Confidential, Danny DeVito. </p> <p>He has his own company to do low-budget films that will both bolster his credibility and keep him topped up with a supply of good parts should the studio well run dry. He is already talking about a screen version of Iceman, and foresees a small run of films based on plays, because the material is to hand and he sees a ready way into it. </p> <p>'I'm just as susceptible as anybody to the things that pull and tempt you,' Spacey says. 'You have to seek out those things both in terms of people and material that are sincere and driven by a similar sensibility to your own. Pretty obviously I'm not only interested in making lots of dough and being famous. As far as Hollywood goes, I don't want to contribute to the problem, whatever I perceive the problem to be.' </p> <p>What does he perceive the problem to be? </p> <p>'Oh, it's massive. It's massive and it's ugly,' he says with a big grin, too smart, too damned relaxed to be drawn into a harangue about the ills of the movie industry. He's at a happy place in his career and, besides, he is about to go on vacation. </p> <p>So Kevin Spacey calls over the waitress and asks for another iced, swirly mocha thing.</p> <p><strong>What they said... what he did</strong></p> <p>'One of the year's finest pictures... by turns hilarious, painful and brutally frank. Kevin Spacey practically glows with vulnerability. His portrayal of the beleaguered suburban male of the species is achingly tender.' Washington Post</p> <p>'Unsettling, unnerving, undefinable, American Beauty is a blood-chilling dark comedy, a strange, brooding and very accomplished film. Kevin Spacey is superb as Lester, whose wife and daughter consider him \"this gigantic loser\". There definitely is a hell of a picture here.' Los Angeles Times </p> <p>' American Beauty is a triumph - adult, smart, involving, stylish. Spacey powers the movie, not only sympathetic as the rebellious suburbanite but also very vulnerable.' New York Times </p> <p><strong> A Bug's Life</strong> (1998) Spacey voices Hopper, the nasty, one-eyed leader of the grasshoppers. </p> <p><strong> The Negotiator</strong> (1998) Spacey plays the Chicago police force's toughest negotiator, Chris Sabian. </p> <p><strong> Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</strong> (1997) Spacey plays Jim Williams, a rich, Gatsbyesque mystery man on trial for murdering his male lover. </p> <p><strong> L.A.

      "body": "<p>She is, the director Claude Chabrol once said, 'the only Hitchcockian heroine in France'. Catherine Deneuve never worked with Hitchcock, but for a time, in the Sixties, and under the direction of others - Polanski, Bu\u00f1uel, Jacques Demy - she epitomised the cool, enigmatic blonde. In an essay which might easily be applied to Deneuve, Hitchcock explained the rationale behind his casting: 'It is important to distinguish between the big, bosomy blonde and the ladylike blonde with the touch of elegance, whose sex must be discovered,' he wrote. 'On the screen, for example, if an actress wants to convey a sexy quality, she ought to maintain a slightly mysterious air. When a man approaches her, the audience should be led to wonder whether she intends to shrink from him or tear off his clothes.' </p> <p>Deneuve had a Hitchcockian pedigree: she was more Grace Kelly, more Kim Novak or Eva Marie Saint than Brigitte Bardot. But Deneuve moved the coolness up a notch: in Repulsion she plays a hysteric disgusted by sex, in Belle de Jour she is a frigid wife who finds an outlet in prostitution - it was as if all that blonde mystery finally came together in her immovable, mask-like face. Truffaut spoke about her 'dream element': in these roles she was blank, pure, sexually unfinished; she became a screen on to which any fantasy could be projected. </p> <p>Deneuve has moved on since then. She is now in her late fifties, and has aged with a grace that would doubtless be unimaginable to the beribboned young girl she played in the Umbrellas of Cherbourg . When I meet her in the bar of a hotel near her home in Paris, she is dressed casually and behaves calmly. She wears tinted glasses, smokes slim white cigarettes, which she takes from a silver case, and speaks in a low, rippling voice - so fast that, as she once admitted, she has even had trouble dubbing herself. </p> <p>This week, Deneuve can be seen in British cinemas in Time Regained , Raoul Ruiz's adaptation of Proust. She plays Odette, the coquettish, charming mother of the girl Marcel loves. Her role is brief, but she carries it with intelligence and grace. When I mention this, Deneuve looks worried, and doesn't take grace as a compliment ('Really? You think it wasn't frivolous enough?'), but it's a mark of how far she's come, and of the kind of roles she has eased into maturely. Though she has worked more or less constantly (this year alone, we can also expect to see her in L\u00e9os Carax's Pola X , R\u00e9gis Wargnier's East-West, and Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark ), the Seventies were not a smooth ride, and by the early Eighties French critics were damning her clunky passage from doll-like fantasy-figure to who knew what? </p> <p>You could say that she had trouble, on screen, becoming a woman. But by the time she starred in Wargnier's Indochine (1991), for which she was nominated for an Oscar, the coolness was gone. She played a mother, and a lover, driven both by sexual desire and overwhelming motherly love. The two emotions clash, tragically, and Deneuve retains her elegance and strength while revealing a crumbling vulnerability and a raw warmth. How did this change come about? </p> <p>'The first person who offered me a mature role was Truffaut, with The Last Metro [in 1980]. He said he was going to give me the role of a woman who was not unattractive, but who had a responsible part in a film, with more to do than just fall in love. So it was in the Eighties that it started.' Andre T\u00e9chin\u00e9 also helped her 'to evolve - not in myself, I mean, but in relation to the audience - by offering me roles of women who were more complex than what you generally find in the cinema'. Deneuve has made three films with T\u00e9chin\u00e9 - Scene of the Crime (1986), My Favourite Season (1993), and Les Voleurs (1996). They introduced her to a naturalism, a kind of rough-edged emotion, which she hadn't previously encountered. She wasn't afraid of the change: 'I was perceived as this sophisticated actress, and T\u00e9chin\u00e9 really unveiled me, if you like, with the parts he wrote for me, in the way he directed me, the way he filmed me - I became someone more vulnerable, closer to a modern woman than to a mythical figure'. She could not have made the shift on her own, she explains, because 'in France, all directors are auteurs so you can't propose projects to them, because they work on their own subjects'. </p> <p>I suggest that if you watch Belle de Jour or Repulsion now, they come across as Catherine Deneuve films. They are united by her, and it's tempting to say that, over time, she has become the auteur of those movies. 'It's true that that happens, though not always, after a very, very long time.' But she explains that when she first worked with Bu\u00f1uel she had no idea what he wanted from her. ' Belle de Jour was very difficult, because it's a film about fantasies, so everything is very masked - more is unsaid than is said. I was very resistant to it initially. I thought he wanted to do something cruder, more naked. It wasn't a lack of confidence in him that made me resistant, but my own prudishness and anxiety. His relationships with his actresses were - well, he could never be really intimate with women, he was a very tormented man, and he didn't speak to his actors much. But it finished up well enough for us to work together again less than two years later.' </p> <p>The later film, Tristana, is the one Deneuve prefers of the two. She plays the title role, a young woman who develops a sexual relationship with her legal guardian and later wreaks her revenge on him - though not before having a leg amputated. (The only time Hitchcock met Bu\u00f1uel, he patted him on the back and said, admiringly, 'Bu\u00f1uel. That wooden leg'.) At one point in Tristana , Deneuve's character stands on a balcony and opens her dressing gown, revealing her body to a boy below. The audience sees only her face. Slowly, strangely, she smiles. 'Yes, I like that scene a lot,' Deneuve remembers. 'I decided to smile, because when I knew how it was framed I wanted to show what you couldn't see. She knows the boy can see her breasts, but also her amputated leg, so it's a way of saying, I know what you're looking at, and I know how I am - a way of having the upper hand despite everything. I always like things that have a double edge.' </p> <p>Deneuve has long been, in her phrase, a 'mythical figure', and not just on screen. When she made Belle de Jour in 1967, Yves Saint Laurent designed the costumes. From then on she became his friend and muse. In 1965 she married David Bailey, who took some wonderful photographs of her - she became an icon, a still. In the Seventies she was the face of Chanel, and in 1985 she was chosen as the face of Marianne, the symbol of the French republic, to be sculpted for exhibition in town halls and to be silhouetted on stamps. But while she was, externally, the image of perfection, the turbulence of her private life always spilt out into the public domain. At 17 she met Roger Vadim - the man who 'discovered' Bardot - and had a child with him. In 1972 she had a daughter with Marcello Mastroianni (Chiara Mastroianni now has a blooming acting career of her own, and also figures in Time Regained ). Deneuve has always tried to keep her privacy. 'We all have a right to our secret garden,' she says. But there is one very personal subject I wanted to ask her about. </p> <p>In 1967, Deneuve and her sister, Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac, played twins in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort , a musical by Jacques Demy. That year, on her way back from a holiday in the south of France, Dorl\u00e9ac died in a car crash. Truffaut, who had directed her in La Peau Douce , wrote in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma : 'It is unacceptable that on 26 June last year, that great cascading laughter was cut short.' She was a year older than Deneuve, and began her acting career earlier. She was serious about it, and had acted on stage. It was only when she was in a film for which an actress had to be found to play her sister that she persuaded Deneuve to audition. From then on, their careers moved in tandem: Deneuve made Repulsion with Polanski, Dorl\u00e9ac starred in his Cul de Sac the following year; both worked with Truffaut, both worked with Demy. </p> <p>But the two couldn't have been more different. Deneuve's reserve was more than matched by Dorl\u00e9ac's joie de vivre. Deneuve envied the mobility of her sister's face; Dorl\u00e9ac, less physically perfect, had a complex about being 'asymmetrical'. They grew up in a liberal family with two younger sisters. Their father was head of dubbing at Paramount, and their mother, whose maiden name Deneuve later adopted, had been a child actor. Until Deneuve left home to live with Vadim, the two girls shared a bunk bed. They were very, very close. </p> <p>In 1996 Deneuve put together a documentary about her sister and a book was published to accompany the film. It was the first time she had been able to speak about her sister since her death, and, she said then, she didn't know if there would be a second time. But now, when I ask, tentatively, about Dorl\u00e9ac, she tells me she is constantly surprised by how vividly Fran\u00e7oise is remembered and by how many admirers she has amongst those who weren't even born when she died - people of my generation. I ask her what she makes of the comment published in an issue of Positif from the Eighties, which offered her this career advice: 'Deneuve lacks an energy, a spikiness, an acidity which she might have borrowed from her sister Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac.' </p> <p>'That's an extremely curious thing to say,' she replies, 'I think it's incredibly incongruous, and incredibly tactless. I think it's totally out of place, and I don't think it means anything. It's like blaming a blonde for being blonde.' Though clearly shocked, Deneuve keeps talking. 'Every time someone says something like that it hurts me because it awakens something - we were so complementary, and I feel something is missing from me. You know, when you're with happy people you feel happy. So it's true that I lack something which to some extent she helped me to be. But, as Giscard d'Estaing said about Mitterrand, he's him and I'm me. That's right. It's difficult enough to be oneself, without having to be thrown back to someone else.' She pauses. 'But now I can accept that kind of comment a bit better, because I've gone back over everything that links me to her. It's less painful than it was. Because it was painful for a very, very, very long time.' </p> <p>I want to know more about Dorl\u00e9ac, but I feel sorry for broaching so intimate a subject. Throughout our conversation, Deneuve has been cordial, then congenial, at times almost motherly, and now vulnerable. She said at one point that she thought some articles about actors would be better written without speaking to the actor in question, but there is much more to admire in Deneuve on meeting her. There is just little point in trying to sum her up. </p> <p>I remember something she said when we were talking about her latest character, Odette: 'I don't feel what you see. I feel a woman who seems to be in control, seems to speak that way of her life and yet she is a frivolous, fragile woman. Or at least she is to me.' </p> <p>Time Regained opens on Friday</p>",

      "body": "<p>'He's big, he's bad, he's older than me dad...' </p> <p>Tony Ford shrugs and grins. How many other players who are mocked, albeit good-naturedly, by fans end up with a call from the Palace and an MBE? He actually quite likes the song the Rochdale supporters affectionately chant in his honour. 'I don't know where they get the big and the bad from but I can't complain about the old, can I?' </p> <p>Not really. Not when he is the only 40-year-old still pulling on his boots and holding down an outfield position in league football. Neville Southall, as Ford points out, is slightly older, but goalkeepers are special cases, and as a late starter, the former Everton and Wales hero has only 19 seasons in the bag to the Rochdale player's 25. Southall will be lucky to top 700 league appearances whereas Ford, who began as a 16-year-old at Grimsby a quarter of a century ago, is already a record breaker on 856. </p> <p>Outfield player just about covers Ford's present role too, for though he has appeared in every position on the field bar goalkeeper for significant lengths of time (with the exception of centre-half, which was strictly an emer gency), he is now back where he started on the right of midfield. 'You can say I play wide right,' he said. 'I haven't got the pace any more to call myself a winger, and if I described myself as a wing-back I'd never hear the end of it from the lads. I just play on the right.' </p> <p>Ford spent 11 seasons with his native Grimsby, helping them rise to the old second division before moving on to Stoke and West Bromwich Albion, before another spell with the Mariners. Scunthorpe and Mansfield were his two other principal ports of call, and when his old Stoke ally Steve Parkin moved from Field Mill to take over as manager at Rochdale, Ford was not too surprised to get an offer to follow. </p> <p>'The surprise had come a couple of seasons earlier,' he said. 'I thought my playing days had finished at 37, when I left Scunthorpe. I joined Barrow to keep fit but I had dropped out of the league, I thought that was it. When Steve persuaded me to go to Mansfield it was as youth team coach. Then when I had been there a while he asked me if I would consider making a comeback, and that's what I'm doing here. I'm still coming back.' </p> <p>He might not have arrived at Spotland had Mansfield looked favourably on his application to become manager - 'It's not as if I've never tried to stop playing' - but they turned him down. 'It's their loss,' Ford said. </p> <p>With Rochdale well in contention for the play-offs Ford is glad he folowed Parkin. There is no secret to his longevity, just an aptitude for training and an appetite for the game. 'I've never smoked, but I can't pretend I don't like the odd drinking binge,' he said. 'Players do look after themselves far better now, we know more about what not to do. Look at Stuart Pearce, back in the England squad recently for goodness sake.' </p> <p>By Ford's reckoning he has played under 14 managers, but the first, Tommy Casey at Grimsby, probably made the biggest impression. 'He was a bit old-fashioned, very big on discipline but also big on fitness, and he used to instil into each of us the need for aggression in football. He brought a lot out of us, and I still remember a lot of what he taught me.' </p> <p>Ford has no regrets, apart from the obvious one of not being born a dozen or so years later. Not that he is bitter about the stupendous salaries currently washing around the Premiership, which never trickled down to any of his clubs. 'I missed out on the big money, but so did Stanley Matthews,' he said. 'But I 've made a good living out of the game so I'm not complaining. I daresay a lot of today's players won't fancy carrying on until they are 40 though, not when they are set up for life before they are half way through their careers.' </p> <p>Ford, as surprised as he was delighted with his MBE, believes there would be more older players about, in the lower leagues at least, were it not for ageism. 'Quite a few players are discouraged by the lack of interest shown in them once they reach a certain age. It takes a brave manager to bring in someone who might have more experience than him, someone who could present a threat to his way of doing things. I've nothing against bringing kids in but young players need people to learn from.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "'He's big, he's bad, he's older than me dad...' Tony Ford shrugs and grins. How many other players who are mocked, albeit good-naturedly, by fans end up with a call from the Palace and an MBE? He actually quite likes the song the Rochdale supporters affectionately chant in his honour. 'I don't know where they get the big and the bad from but I can't complain about the old, can I?' Not really. Not when he is the only 40-year-old still pulling on his boots and holding down an outfield position in league football. Neville Southall, as Ford points out, is slightly older, but goalkeepers are special cases, and as a late starter, the former Everton and Wales hero has only 19 seasons in the bag to the Rochdale player's 25. Southall will be lucky to top 700 league appearances whereas Ford, who began as a 16-year-old at Grimsby a quarter of a century ago, is already a record breaker on 856. Outfield player just about covers Ford's present role too, for though he has appeared in every position on the field bar goalkeeper for significant lengths of time (with the exception of centre-half, which was strictly an emer gency), he is now back where he started on the right of midfield. 'You can say I play wide right,' he said. 'I haven't got the pace any more to call myself a winger, and if I described myself as a wing-back I'd never hear the end of it from the lads. I just play on the right.' Ford spent 11 seasons with his native Grimsby, helping them rise to the old second division before moving on to Stoke and West Bromwich Albion, before another spell with the Mariners. Scunthorpe and Mansfield were his two other principal ports of call, and when his old Stoke ally Steve Parkin moved from Field Mill to take over as manager at Rochdale, Ford was not too surprised to get an offer to follow. 'The surprise had come a couple of seasons earlier,' he said. 'I thought my playing days had finished at 37, when I left Scunthorpe. I joined Barrow to keep fit but I had dropped out of the league, I thought that was it. When Steve persuaded me to go to Mansfield it was as youth team coach. Then when I had been there a while he asked me if I would consider making a comeback, and that's what I'm doing here. I'm still coming back.' He might not have arrived at Spotland had Mansfield looked favourably on his application to become manager - 'It's not as if I've never tried to stop playing' - but they turned him down. 'It's their loss,' Ford said. With Rochdale well in contention for the play-offs Ford is glad he folowed Parkin. There is no secret to his longevity, just an aptitude for training and an appetite for the game. 'I've never smoked, but I can't pretend I don't like the odd drinking binge,' he said. 'Players do look after themselves far better now, we know more about what not to do. Look at Stuart Pearce, back in the England squad recently for goodness sake.' By Ford's reckoning he has played under 14 managers, but the first, Tommy Casey at Grimsby, probably made the biggest impression. 'He was a bit old-fashioned, very big on discipline but also big on fitness, and he used to instil into each of us the need for aggression in football. He brought a lot out of us, and I still remember a lot of what he taught me.' Ford has no regrets, apart from the obvious one of not being born a dozen or so years later. Not that he is bitter about the stupendous salaries currently washing around the Premiership, which never trickled down to any of his clubs. 'I missed out on the big money, but so did Stanley Matthews,' he said. 'But I 've made a good living out of the game so I'm not complaining. I daresay a lot of today's players won't fancy carrying on until they are 40 though, not when they are set up for life before they are half way through their careers.' Ford, as surprised as he was delighted with his MBE, believes there would be more older players about, in the lower leagues at least, were it not for ageism. 'Quite a few players are discouraged by the lack of interest shown in them once they reach a certain age. It takes a brave manager to bring in someone who might have more experience than him, someone who could present a threat to his way of doing things. I've nothing against bringing kids in but young players need people to learn from.'",

      "body": "<p>Our lunch cannot go on too much longer. Malcolm Allison has to pick up his nine-year-old daughter from school. Hang on, you're thinking, isn't Allison into his seventies by now? That's right, 72 to be precise. So what's he doing with a daughter that young? Come on, you remember Big Mal. Just because he was into his sixties, that was no reason not to start a (third) family. </p> <p>At this time of retrospection, with the twentieth century just having ebbed to its close, an audience with Allison, a good player until struck down by tuberculosis and an outstanding coach, seemed a better way than most to cast a critical, autobiographical eye over more than half a century of English football. Allison signed as a professional with Charlton in 1945 and two years ago began working part-time as a scout for Arsenal, an appointment that ended a brief spell of idleness after he was sacked by local radio for splicing training-ground language into his comments on a Middlesbrough-Newcastle derby. His memories might lack a little precision, but at least they would be vivid, different and insightful. </p> <p>Perhaps London-boy Allison's most surprising feat, given his sybaritic past, is ending up happily married and living in Yarm in Cleveland - close to the parents of his third wife Lynn, who is 27 years his junior - on a neat, unpretentious housing estate. Moneywise, he is not the man he once was. His pension and Lynn's wages as a teacher keep them going. But his contentment is palpable and if the years have inevitably done some damage to his craggy good looks, they have left his twinkle-eyed wit and wisdom untouched. He limps a little from an arthritic ankle, but otherwise is fit. 'I went for a test 18 months ago,' he says. 'The doctor told me, \"You've got better lungs than anyone\".' </p> <p>Having part of his left lung removed in 1958 as a result of TB was what ended Allison's career as a central defender after he had played three First Division matches for Charlton and 255 League and Cup games for West Ham after signing for them in 1951. 'I couldn't understand it,' he says, 'I was a good trainer. I never drank, I never smoked. Then one day I was due to play in an evening match at Upton Park, I was walking down some stairs and collapsed. Then we went to Sheffield United to play an afternoon match and stayed overnight. Noel Cantwell, who shared a room with me, said to the manager the next day, \"I don't know what's wrong with Malcolm. He was coughing all night.\" They sent me to the hospital and the doctor said, \"What else can you do?\" I said, \"Not a lot.\" And he said, \"Well you're not going to play football any more\".' </p> <p>In fact, Allison could do something else, he could coach and train players. He had always been interested in this side of the game, sometimes to his detriment. He tells a wonderful story about when he was still a young reserve at Charlton, whose first team were full of internationals and had just won the FA Cup. He became disillusioned with Jimmy Trotter's training methods, which consisted mainly of running round the track and up and down the terracing. 'We were all standing there after one of these sessions,' he recalls, 'and I said, \"Mr Trotter, the training's effing rubbish.\" And all these players turned round, \"Who is this young upstart, like?\" I said, \"All we do is run around the track, up and down the terracing and play 11-a-side. We don't do anything.\" </p> <p>'Next morning I had to go to see Jimmy Seed, the manager, and he said, \"Malcolm, you insulted Mr Trotter yesterday.\" I said, \"No I didn't, I just told him the training was rubbish.\" He said, \"You can't say that to Mr Trotter, and, anyway, I'm going to transfer you to West Ham United.\" So I said: \"Can I shake your hand, Mr Seed? I want to thank you for teaching me the art of communication, because you've just spoken to me for the third time in seven years\".' </p> <p>What really alerted Allison to the possibilities of coaching was Hungary's performance against England at Wembley in 1953. 'I went to the game with a player called Jimmy Andrews, a Scottish boy. As we were walking into the ground, the Hungarian team were warming up and Jimmy said to me, \"We'll murder these, Mal.\" I said, \"Why's that, Jim?\" He said, \"Look at that number ten over there, he's about a stone overweight\".' The No 10 was the legendary Ferenc Puskas - 'He did have a little tummy on him,' concedes Allison - who scored twice in the Hungarians' historic 6-3 win. </p> <p>'What was absolutely amazing to me,' says Allison, 'was how the Hungarians, by changing positions, made such a difference. Herbert Chapman's W-M formation [the full-backs and half-backs arranged in a W and the five forwards in an M] lasted for more than 25 years. Everyone copied this formation, so when the Hungarians changed their tactics and played with a deep centre-forward, they destroyed England. Okay, they might have had some great players, but they weren't that much better than us, not 6-3 and 7-1 [Hungary's margin of victory a year later in Budapest] better.' </p> <p>Allison believes the match had not only a profound effect on him, but also on one Alf Ramsey, to the extent that it laid the foundation for English football's finest hour. 'Ramsey was at right back [at Wembley] and nearly all their goals came down that side,' says Allison. 'He couldn't handle the winger, who was too quick for him. So when Ramsey became England manager, he adopted the two deep wingers to protect the full-backs so they couldn't get chased like he had been. He developed this 4-4-2 formation, which won the 1966 World Cup. It got me thinking, too, that it was more about formations, about the way you played, than about great players.' </p> <p>Allison's restless nature meant that throughout his long career as a coach and manager he never stayed at one club for long, apart from his eight-year first stint at Manchester City as assistant to Joe Mercer and then as manager. At City, he proved conclusively that he had exceptional gifts as a coach and motivator. Under Old Trafford's envious gaze, he helped to quide City to the First (1967-68) and Second (1965-66) Division championships, the FA Cup (1969), the League Cup (1970) and the European Cup Winners' Cup (1970). </p> <p>He says his most pleasing result ever was the 3-1 win at Old Trafford as City closed in on the 1968 League title. United were then champions and would, in a few weeks, lift the European Cup with their memorable 4-1 victory over Benfica. And he tells of a previously undisclosed piece of typical Allison mischief: 'Nobody knows this, but the night before the match I had the flag on top of the stand at Old Trafford pulled down to half-mast. I got a steeplejack to put a ladder up the side of the building and he pulled it down to half-mast. And you know, no one noticed until a few days afterwards.' </p> <p>Allison went back to Maine Road in 1979 with disastrous results. 'The first time, because they were doing so badly, everything I asked them to do they did. They didn't argue. When I went the second time there were lots of successful players, but they didn't want to work. They didn't want to train and they moaned and they dodged. They were non-professional.' </p> <p>Many thought his predilection for showmanship was a distraction that affected Allison's record as a manager, although in 1976 , during his most flamboyant spell - when his preposterous fedora hat became a feature of English grounds - he achieved one of his most memorable feats, taking Third Division Crystal Palace to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. 'I knew about this fellow called Jack Tinn, the Portsmouth manager in 1939 who wore spats. When he was asked why he wore them, he said, \"We're going to win the Cup with these spats.\" I think they were 40-1 and they went and won it. So I thought, \"Well, nobody can really see spats, so I'm going to wear the fedora\".' </p> <p>Palace beat Leeds, Chelsea and Sunderland in successive away matches in that Cup run, but it was an incident after their third-round victory at Scarborough that convinced Allison of the effectiveness of his outlandish headgear. 'As I was going past their dressing room, all their players were in the bath and I could hear them saying, \"What do you think about that big-headed bastard. First chance we ever have of getting some publicity and he comes along in that stupid hat\".' </p> <p>Allison is characteristically uncompromising on the subject of modern coaching. 'It's very disappointing,' he says. 'I mean that Charles Hughes [the Football Association's former director of coaching] knocked us back a hundred years. How the FA can run our football is ridiculous. There's nobody there who's been in football. I mean all the people who ever achieved anything in the game - people like Brian Clough and Jack Charlton - never got a job at the FA.' </p> <p>He says that modern British players - Tony Adams is 'probably the best centre-half I've ever seen', and Michael Owen, 'not only is he like lightning, but he's technically very, very good' - have to rely on the influence of foreign stars they play with and see on television to raise the standard of their games. </p> <p>He also thinks that schools are failing to develop the very young, and reckons he is in possession of some pretty convincing evidence. 'Who teaches the kids at school?' he asks. 'I'll tell you who teaches them. In 90 per cent of the schools, the women teach them. Now, I haven't got anything against women, I like them. But I mean my missus teaches the team in her school and she's slow, she's not got a good left foot and she's got a bad right foot, she's not good in the air and she can't bring it down on her chest.' </p> <p>Nine-year-old Gina, though, is the Yorkshire sprint champion and her doting dad better be off to pick her up from school. </p> <p><strong>Mal's Best XI</strong></p> <p>Jozef Mezsaros (Sporting Lisbon)</p> <p>Tony Book</p> <p>Mike Doyle </p> <p>Enrique Jordao (Sporting Lisbon)</p> <p>Glyn Pardoe</p> <p>Mike Summerbee</p> <p>Colin Bell</p> <p>Neil Young</p> <p>Peter Taylor (Crystal Palace)</p> <p>Francis Lee</p> <p>Manuel Fernandez (Sporting Lisbon) </p> <p>Sub: Alan Oakes<br></p> <p><strong>All Man City unless stated </strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>The shutters were down at Helmut Kohl's bungalow in Oggersheim last week when the former Chancellor heard the bad news he had been expecting for weeks. Kohl was alone inside with his wife Hannelore as he read a statement from Bonn's public prosecutor announcing a full-scale criminal investigation into the veteran politician's financial dealings. In a terse statement issued through a spokesman in Berlin, Kohl expressed regret at the prosecutor's decision and promised to co-operate with the investigation into secret donations to his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But he gave no sign that he is about to break his silence over the identity of the donors who handed him hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash during his 16 years in power. Kohl's refusal to name the donors has transformed a scandal into a catastrophe for his Christian Democrats, who face financial disaster in the shape of heavy fines for breaking rules on party funding. Worse still, as poll ratings plummet, the party that Kohl led for a quarter of a century is on the verge of a split that could destroy it. 'Nobody in the party wants a split, we want unity. If Helmut Kohl would name the donors or the donors themselves would release him from his word of honour, we would have the solution to the problem,' Angela Merkel, the CDU's general secretary said. Kohl has admitted accepting up to Dm2 million (\u00a3660,000) in cash from anonymous donors between 1993 and 1998 and channeling the funds to CDU branches via secret accounts. German law requires political parties to identify donors of sums greater than Dm20,000 and the CDU could face heavy fines for its failure to do so.The party has also lost out on matching funds from the state worth 50 per cent of every private donation it receives. A report issued by the party on Friday revealed that Kohl received almost half a million marks more than he admitted between 1993 and 1996. Dm100,000 went to his local party organisation - contrary to Kohl's claims that he used the slush fund to prop up the CDU in the impoverished east of the country. 'I could never be bribed. I have never taken money for myself, nothing has ever gone into my personal, private account. I was party chairman for 25 years, unpaid, without compensation,' Kohl declared before Christmas. Kohl insists that he cannot break the promise he gave to donors that they would remain anonymous. But his critics suspect that the real reason for his silence is that some of the money he received may not have been declared by the donors for tax purposes. Prosecutors in Frankfurt are investigating three anonymous legacies worth a total of more than Dm12 million that the CDU received from Switzerland and Liechtenstein between 1989 and 1996. A Liechtenstein-based lawyer close to Kohl organised two of the transfers but the origin of the donations remains unknown. Although Kohl has only admitted receiving donations between 1993 and 1998, prosecutors are investigating payments that may have been made long before that period. They are also likely to investigate links between Kohl's accountant and a Swiss bank. Most Germans believe the former Chancellor when he says that he did not take any money for himself and many accept his claim that no government decisions were influenced by donations to party. But questions surround a Dm1 million cash payment from an arms dealer that may have been linked to the government's approval of a lucrative arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Another large donation came from a property company that bought privatised housing at Dm1 billion less than the price offered by the highest bidder. The scandal has also revived interest in the controversial sale of an eastern German oil refinery to the French oil company Elf Aquitaine in the early Nineties. The government has confirmed recently that important files relating to the sale have disappeared. With few of his fellows willing to weigh into Kohl in public, it has been left to the 45-year-old Merkel to play Cordelia to Kohl's Lear, spelling out the truth that others feared to utter. In an open letter to Kohl published before Christmas, Merkel urged him to put the interest of the party first by breaking his silence. She went on to declare that the Kohl era was over and called on Christian Democrats to look ahead to a fresh political landscape. Kohl's allies reacted furiously accusing her of using her former patron's misfortunes to advance her own career - even claiming Merkel's letter provides prosecutors with the evidence they need to proceed against Kohl. Historian Arnulf Baring believes that Germany will soon reassess the former Chancellor's achievements. 'The news of the funding allegations marks the first step in taking stock of the Kohl era. With it, the Germans have put the illumination of the 'chancellor of unity' behind them,' he said. <br>\u0095Denis Staunton writes for the Irish Times</p>",

Kohl has admitted accepting up to Dm2 million (\u00a3660,000) in cash from anonymous donors between 1993 and 1998 and channeling the funds to CDU branches via secret accounts. German law requires political parties to identify donors of sums greater than Dm20,000 and the CDU could face heavy fines for its failure to do so.The party has also lost out on matching funds from the state worth 50 per cent of every private donation it receives. A report issued by the party on Friday revealed that Kohl received almost half a million marks more than he admitted between 1993 and 1996. Dm100,000 went to his local party organisation - contrary to Kohl's claims that he used the slush fund to prop up the CDU in the impoverished east of the country. 'I could never be bribed. I have never taken money for myself, nothing has ever gone into my personal, private account. I was party chairman for 25 years, unpaid, without compensation,' Kohl declared before Christmas. Kohl insists that he cannot break the promise he gave to donors that they would remain anonymous. But his critics suspect that the real reason for his silence is that some of the money he received may not have been declared by the donors for tax purposes. Prosecutors in Frankfurt are investigating three anonymous legacies worth a total of more than Dm12 million that the CDU received from Switzerland and Liechtenstein between 1989 and 1996. A Liechtenstein-based lawyer close to Kohl organised two of the transfers but the origin of the donations remains unknown. Although Kohl has only admitted receiving donations between 1993 and 1998, prosecutors are investigating payments that may have been made long before that period. They are also likely to investigate links between Kohl's accountant and a Swiss bank. Most Germans believe the former Chancellor when he says that he did not take any money for himself and many accept his claim that no government decisions were influenced by donations to party. But questions surround a Dm1 million cash payment from an arms dealer that may have been linked to the government's approval of a lucrative arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Another large donation came from a property company that bought privatised housing at Dm1 billion less than the price offered by the highest bidder. The scandal has also revived interest in the controversial sale of an eastern German oil refinery to the French oil company Elf Aquitaine in the early Nineties. The government has confirmed recently that important files relating to the sale have disappeared. With few of his fellows willing to weigh into Kohl in public, it has been left to the 45-year-old Merkel to play Cordelia to Kohl's Lear, spelling out the truth that others feared to utter. In an open letter to Kohl published before Christmas, Merkel urged him to put the interest of the party first by breaking his silence. She went on to declare that the Kohl era was over and called on Christian Democrats to look ahead to a fresh political landscape. Kohl's allies reacted furiously accusing her of using her former patron's misfortunes to advance her own career - even claiming Merkel's letter provides prosecutors with the evidence they need to proceed against Kohl. Historian Arnulf Baring believes that Germany will soon reassess the former Chancellor's achievements. 'The news of the funding allegations marks the first step in taking stock of the Kohl era. With it, the Germans have put the illumination of the 'chancellor of unity' behind them,' he said. \u0095Denis Staunton writes for the Irish Times",

      "body": "<p>Less than 18 hours after moving into the Kremlin, the seat of supreme power in Russia since time immemorial, Vladimir Putin hurried south bearing lethal New Year gifts. The new Russian strongman's five months as Prime Minister are bathed in Chechen blood. And in one of his first acts as Acting President yesterday, Putin went to the war that has been the key to his dizzying rise to power.</p> <p>In Chechnya's Russian-held second city of Gudermes -- the place that Putin wants to turn into a showpiece new Chechen capital when his troops have fininished flattening Grozny - the new leader dispensed engraved hunting knives to Russia's new, if temporary, war heroes.</p> <p>It was a calculated, cold-blooded gesture, redolent with the symbolism of Putin's New Russia. Meanwhile, his Kremlin crony, Boris Berezovsky, the media mogul whose television station has been so important in creating the Putin phenomenon, danced in the new century at a sumptuous ball at the Bolshoi costing $1,500 a head. But Berezovksy's cameras were on hand to show Putin live on television at 6am yesterday standing in Chechnya, handing out knives, and vowing to halt 'the break-up of the Russian Federation'.</p> <p>While tens of thousands of ordinary Muscovites thronged Red Square outside Putin's new office, to usher in the new year and hail a new President, there was no millennium celebration for the workaholic 46-year-old former spy and bureaucrat. At 2am Putin and his wife wrapped themselves in winter parkas, clambered aboard the presidential aircraft and headed for Gudermes.</p> <p>'Better late than never,' he quipped to the Russian troops. 'We had to turn back and finish the journey by car. Sorry it took so long.'A wry sense of irony, perhaps, since the last thing Putin can be accused of is shilly-shallying. On the contrary, the lightning visit to Chechnya in the middle of the millennial night again highlighted the energy, the action, the dynamism that is such a strong element of the new leader's appeal to Russians.</p> <p>And the hunting knives sent a chilling signal of toughness, determination and violence. Since late on Christmas Eve, 25 miles to the west of Gudermes, thousands of Russian troops have been slogging through the mud and mist of a battered city the Russians themselves built as a fortress and a garrison 170 years ago. Young lads from Siberia, from the Urals, from the Don basin have spent the entire week haplessly trying to wish their political and military bosses a very 'Happy New Year' by vanquishing Grozny.</p> <p>The conquest of the city - a graveyard for the Russian army five years ago this weekend - would put a holiday spring in the steps of the generals disgraced the last time around and bring a smile to Putin's poker face.</p> <p>Grozny will fall soon to the Russians. But it hasn't fallen yet, although yesterday the Russians reported breaking through rebel lines in their advance towards the city centre from three directions.</p> <p>But while that fortress continues to defy Putin's iron will, Russia's most famous fortress, the Kremlin itself, fell to the man who says he is committed to restoring Russia to its heyday as a great power. At noon on Friday, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instantly stepping down after two terms as President and handing all his powers to Putin until new presidential elections are held at the end of March.</p> <p>Putin said he would perform as both President and Prime Minister at least until the new State Duma, or lower house, convenes later this month.</p> <p>And then came the pay-off. Putin immediately signed a new presidential decree guaranteeing Yeltsin and his family immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>It remains unclear when Yeltsin finally decided to go, but it seems the decision was taken only in the last few days. The fallout from the Duma election a fortnight ago today was sensational, confirming the Putin phenomenon and establishing the Prime Minister as the most popular and most formidable force in Russian politics.</p> <p>The Yeltsin camp, which created Putin as a politician and which sees him as a protector of its interests, started leaking rumours that Yeltsin might go early to capitalise on Putin's high opinion poll ratings, making him the runaway favourite for the presidency.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Kremlin aides were told to go shopping for a new country dacha for Yeltsin in the exclusive district of Odintsovo, outside Moscow, though they say they did not know he was about to quit. But the immunity deal agreed with Putin also provides Yeltsin with a new state-owned dacha. Yeltsin also gets a pension, a car, bodyguards, and the attention of the same medical experts who have been treating his heart disease and sundry other ailments.</p> <p>The first public sign that changes were afoot came last Thursday when Yeltsin, at short notice, cancelled his appearance at a Kremlin reception that evening at which he had been due to deliver a major speech on Russia and the new millenium. This new-year reception is traditionally hosted by the Mayor of Moscow, but the incumbent, Yury Luzhkov, is the main political enemy of Yeltsin and Putin, so the Kremlin camp hijacked the occasion.

      "bodyText": "Less than 18 hours after moving into the Kremlin, the seat of supreme power in Russia since time immemorial, Vladimir Putin hurried south bearing lethal New Year gifts. The new Russian strongman's five months as Prime Minister are bathed in Chechen blood. And in one of his first acts as Acting President yesterday, Putin went to the war that has been the key to his dizzying rise to power. In Chechnya's Russian-held second city of Gudermes -- the place that Putin wants to turn into a showpiece new Chechen capital when his troops have fininished flattening Grozny - the new leader dispensed engraved hunting knives to Russia's new, if temporary, war heroes. It was a calculated, cold-blooded gesture, redolent with the symbolism of Putin's New Russia. Meanwhile, his Kremlin crony, Boris Berezovsky, the media mogul whose television station has been so important in creating the Putin phenomenon, danced in the new century at a sumptuous ball at the Bolshoi costing $1,500 a head. But Berezovksy's cameras were on hand to show Putin live on television at 6am yesterday standing in Chechnya, handing out knives, and vowing to halt 'the break-up of the Russian Federation'. While tens of thousands of ordinary Muscovites thronged Red Square outside Putin's new office, to usher in the new year and hail a new President, there was no millennium celebration for the workaholic 46-year-old former spy and bureaucrat. At 2am Putin and his wife wrapped themselves in winter parkas, clambered aboard the presidential aircraft and headed for Gudermes. 'Better late than never,' he quipped to the Russian troops. 'We had to turn back and finish the journey by car. Sorry it took so long.'A wry sense of irony, perhaps, since the last thing Putin can be accused of is shilly-shallying. On the contrary, the lightning visit to Chechnya in the middle of the millennial night again highlighted the energy, the action, the dynamism that is such a strong element of the new leader's appeal to Russians. And the hunting knives sent a chilling signal of toughness, determination and violence. Since late on Christmas Eve, 25 miles to the west of Gudermes, thousands of Russian troops have been slogging through the mud and mist of a battered city the Russians themselves built as a fortress and a garrison 170 years ago. Young lads from Siberia, from the Urals, from the Don basin have spent the entire week haplessly trying to wish their political and military bosses a very 'Happy New Year' by vanquishing Grozny. The conquest of the city - a graveyard for the Russian army five years ago this weekend - would put a holiday spring in the steps of the generals disgraced the last time around and bring a smile to Putin's poker face. Grozny will fall soon to the Russians. But it hasn't fallen yet, although yesterday the Russians reported breaking through rebel lines in their advance towards the city centre from three directions. But while that fortress continues to defy Putin's iron will, Russia's most famous fortress, the Kremlin itself, fell to the man who says he is committed to restoring Russia to its heyday as a great power. At noon on Friday, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instantly stepping down after two terms as President and handing all his powers to Putin until new presidential elections are held at the end of March. Putin said he would perform as both President and Prime Minister at least until the new State Duma, or lower house, convenes later this month. And then came the pay-off. Putin immediately signed a new presidential decree guaranteeing Yeltsin and his family immunity from prosecution. It remains unclear when Yeltsin finally decided to go, but it seems the decision was taken only in the last few days. The fallout from the Duma election a fortnight ago today was sensational, confirming the Putin phenomenon and establishing the Prime Minister as the most popular and most formidable force in Russian politics. The Yeltsin camp, which created Putin as a politician and which sees him as a protector of its interests, started leaking rumours that Yeltsin might go early to capitalise on Putin's high opinion poll ratings, making him the runaway favourite for the presidency. Earlier this week, Kremlin aides were told to go shopping for a new country dacha for Yeltsin in the exclusive district of Odintsovo, outside Moscow, though they say they did not know he was about to quit. But the immunity deal agreed with Putin also provides Yeltsin with a new state-owned dacha. Yeltsin also gets a pension, a car, bodyguards, and the attention of the same medical experts who have been treating his heart disease and sundry other ailments. The first public sign that changes were afoot came last Thursday when Yeltsin, at short notice, cancelled his appearance at a Kremlin reception that evening at which he had been due to deliver a major speech on Russia and the new millenium. This new-year reception is traditionally hosted by the Mayor of Moscow, but the incumbent, Yury Luzhkov, is the main political enemy of Yeltsin and Putin, so the Kremlin camp hijacked the occasion. Putin, not Yeltsin, appeared. Kremlin aides say that was the day the deal was done. The President's televised New Year address to the nation always takes place at 10 minutes to midnight. It is always pre-recorded. Yeltsin scrapped his original address, called the cameras to his Kremlin office on Friday morning and dropped his valedictory bombshell. Just before that, Yeltsin had called in Patriarch Aleksey, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Putin, and the other 'power' Cabinet members - the Ministers of the Interior, Defence, and Foreign Affairs - to tell them the news. He then cleared out his office, ushered in Putin, told him 'this is your office now', got into his official limousine, and drove out of the Kremlin after eight tumultuous years. Less than 12 hours later it was Putin who was addressing the nation, his straight face peering down on thousands of partying Muscovites from giant video screens in Red Square. Magnanimous in his hour of triumph, he saluted Boris Yeltsin's 'huge achievements. It will be some time before we can really appreciate how much this man did for Russia.' And for Vladimir Putin. The new President's biggest and most immediate challenge - as testified by yesterday's surprise visit - is Chechnya. In the week-old ground battle for Grozny - the storming that isn't a storming, as one Moscow newspaper dubbed it - tens of thousands of Russian troops have been inching forward fearfully, backed by overwhelming artillery and tank fire, to run into a couple of thousand nimble urban guerrillas who know every yard of their city. Putin's main appeal is that he promises Russia will walk tall again. He promises to make the people and the army feel good about themselves again. And he cheerfully pockets the political dividend. In a policy initiative last week, his first apart from the war, Putin drew on Soviet and Tsarist custom and practice to sketch out his new model Russia: collectivist, patriotic, powerful. Above all, it is the State, not the individual, that is at the core of the new leader's vision. The Russian media are on-message. The parliament, the army, the security bodies and virtually all the political parties across the spectrum are supportive. The public backs the war. Yeltsin's last speech before his resignation statement described the military campaign as 'faultless'. Putin told his troops yesterday in Gudermes: 'This is not simply about restoring honour and dignity to the country. No, this is about more serious things. This is about how to bring about the end of the break-up of Russia. That is your fundamental goal.' But it is not only Russian and Chechen blood that is being spilt. Russian honour is being spent in Chechnya. Moscow has had three years to get to grips with the problems of Chechnya, and it has barely even bothered to try. Its vast security and intelligence apparatus was entirely capable, given the political green light, of launching a targeted policing operation to deal with the 'bandits and terrorists'.

It tackles the tricks that language can play, the truth of the dialect. </p> <p>The long title poem 'The Wind Dog' is one the reader will return to. A construct of quotes remade by their new context, it uses the growth of the individual as a cumulative referencing device.

Onlookers are convinced he's been strangled by his own story, his 'throat snickt by the word', but the police suspect murder, and two local officers, Evariste Pilon and Phil\u00e9mon Bouaffesse, are assigned to unravel the mystery. It is a thankless task: the market crowd, steeped in the oral traditions of their region, respond to the officers' interrogations by embarking on vast, fantastical adventures in the realm of discourse, an extraordinary display of the myriad possibilities of language, but not exactly the hard facts the police are looking for. There is a plot of sorts, but the characters' refusal to abide by the conventions of the police procedural genre into which they have been incongruously plunged is part of the point of Chamoiseau's exhilarating, energising novel. </p> <p> <strong> DUANE'S DEPRESSED </strong></p> <p><strong>Larry McMurtry</strong> </p> <p>Orion \u00a36.99, pp373 </p> <p> It's not so much the fact that Texas oilman Duane Moore leaves Karla, his wife of 40 years, to live in a cabin in the hills that leaves his family and town aghast and worried for his health, it's the fact that he walks out on her. Duane has driven a pickup for as long as he can remember; neither he, nor anyone else he knows, has ever walked anywhere. Karla, a worrier, is sure he is insane; his druggie children and delinquent grandchildren are simply baffled. Duane doesn't know why he's left, either. 'Without exactly knowing it, he had reached a point in his life where he had to live differently if he was to live at all,' writes McMurtry, 'and his feet and legs, somehow recognising that fact before he had been able to face it consciously, had hurried him away and saved him.' A moving journey of self-discovery, Duane's story is told in McMurtry's trademark deadpan style, free of sentimentality, and is often hilarious, despite its subject matter. </p> <p> <strong> ISAIAH BERLIN: A LIFE </strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Ignatieff</strong> </p> <p>Vintage \u00a38.99, pp356 </p> <p> As the foremost liberal intellectual of his century, Isaiah Berlin's political philosophy stressed the inevitability of moral diversity and the dangers inherent in any quest for ethical uniformity. It's tempting to seek the source of Berlin's thought in the extraordinary multiplicity of the environments in which he moved, first as a Latvian emigrant and subsequently as a British diplomat, in a life which brought him into contact with the era's foremost personalities and political movements. He couldn't have hoped for a more assiduous biographer than Ignatieff, whose approach, a combination of admiration and criticism when it is required, makes this much more than an authorised biography. </p> <p> <strong> BRAVE NEW WORLDS: GENETICS AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE </strong></p> <p><strong>Bryan Appleyard</strong> </p> <p>HarperCollins \u00a38.99, pp197 </p> <p> Appleyard's fierce polemic traces the most exciting and alarming developments in modern science, from the announcement in a Cambridge pub of the discovery of DNA to recent panics over cloning, designer babies and genetically modified crops, a roll-call of the ethical dilemmas that have defined the past few years. Appleyard's accounts of the various controversies are solid and engaging, but it his elegant, concise closing essay that makes this book worth buying.

      "bodyText": "SOLIBO MAGNIFICENT Patrick Chamoiseau Granta \u00a36.99, pp190 Amid the intoxicating noise and colour of carnival in Fort-de-France, Martinique, the renowned storyteller Solibo Magnificent falls dead in the marketplace in the middle of a performance. Onlookers are convinced he's been strangled by his own story, his 'throat snickt by the word', but the police suspect murder, and two local officers, Evariste Pilon and Phil\u00e9mon Bouaffesse, are assigned to unravel the mystery. It is a thankless task: the market crowd, steeped in the oral traditions of their region, respond to the officers' interrogations by embarking on vast, fantastical adventures in the realm of discourse, an extraordinary display of the myriad possibilities of language, but not exactly the hard facts the police are looking for. There is a plot of sorts, but the characters' refusal to abide by the conventions of the police procedural genre into which they have been incongruously plunged is part of the point of Chamoiseau's exhilarating, energising novel. DUANE'S DEPRESSED Larry McMurtry Orion \u00a36.99, pp373 It's not so much the fact that Texas oilman Duane Moore leaves Karla, his wife of 40 years, to live in a cabin in the hills that leaves his family and town aghast and worried for his health, it's the fact that he walks out on her. Duane has driven a pickup for as long as he can remember; neither he, nor anyone else he knows, has ever walked anywhere. Karla, a worrier, is sure he is insane; his druggie children and delinquent grandchildren are simply baffled. Duane doesn't know why he's left, either. 'Without exactly knowing it, he had reached a point in his life where he had to live differently if he was to live at all,' writes McMurtry, 'and his feet and legs, somehow recognising that fact before he had been able to face it consciously, had hurried him away and saved him.' A moving journey of self-discovery, Duane's story is told in McMurtry's trademark deadpan style, free of sentimentality, and is often hilarious, despite its subject matter. ISAIAH BERLIN: A LIFE Michael Ignatieff Vintage \u00a38.99, pp356 As the foremost liberal intellectual of his century, Isaiah Berlin's political philosophy stressed the inevitability of moral diversity and the dangers inherent in any quest for ethical uniformity. It's tempting to seek the source of Berlin's thought in the extraordinary multiplicity of the environments in which he moved, first as a Latvian emigrant and subsequently as a British diplomat, in a life which brought him into contact with the era's foremost personalities and political movements. He couldn't have hoped for a more assiduous biographer than Ignatieff, whose approach, a combination of admiration and criticism when it is required, makes this much more than an authorised biography. BRAVE NEW WORLDS: GENETICS AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE Bryan Appleyard HarperCollins \u00a38.99, pp197 Appleyard's fierce polemic traces the most exciting and alarming developments in modern science, from the announcement in a Cambridge pub of the discovery of DNA to recent panics over cloning, designer babies and genetically modified crops, a roll-call of the ethical dilemmas that have defined the past few years. Appleyard's accounts of the various controversies are solid and engaging, but it his elegant, concise closing essay that makes this book worth buying. In it, he rails against the spread of the ideology of scientism and calls for the formulation of a coherent set of values with which we can evaluate the products of our scientific age.

According to a recent report by the American Psychological Association, the modern woman is depressed, exhausted from the burdens of work and domestic responsibilities. On the other hand, nobody can deny the flowering of opportunities for women such as easy access to contraception, the growing affordability of childcare and anti-sexual discrimination employment laws. These have created a new, ambitious, 'ladette' generation. </p> <p>At a time when women's future looks so rosy, it's depressing to find that the way women exercise free choice in their personal lives troubles an increasing number of journalists, feminists and policy-makers. How women decide to negotiate sexual relationships, their style of parenting and their attitude to home life are under constant scrutiny. They are said to be in need of all kinds of professional advice and state protection in their personal lives. But a culture promoting anxiety about women's personal choice and a reliance on professionals and the state will make women less able to make free choices. </p> <p>Melanie Phillips, formerly of The Observer and author of <strong>The Sex-Change Society</strong>, begins her assault on contemporary moral values by questioning the motivations of mothers who live independently of men. As she puts it: 'For freedom, see selfishness; for independence, see abandonment.' Stressing that women should be allowed to be single or work if they want to, Phillips argues that marriage continues to be in their best interests once they have children. The traditional family is more likely to get women out of poverty, satisfy the father's needs and guarantee children's happiness and safety. </p> <p>Her other main target is policy-makers who wish to feminise the state and codify these new lifestyle arrangements at the expense of marriage. Policy-makers want men to feel and care like women and for women to be forced to work like men. Phillips provides an impressive body of research to counter gender assumptions. Each page details statistical errors, which she calls 'the gender equivalent of Stalin's Big Lie'. In fact, she says, the majority of adults desire marriage and don't experience domestic violence. As she rightly points out, the new thinking demonises men and masculinity as if women were saints and feminine traits were intrinsically better. </p> <p>This book is a welcome antidote to anyone worried about New Labour's interference in personal relationships. Despite all the Government's non-judgmental rhetoric, Phillips shows how women are encouraged to become independent of men, yet dependent on the state. State-provided childcare seems to offer liberation for women, yet is it free choice when poorer lone mothers are dragooned into attending DSS interviews to qualify for nursery places? These mothers cannot chose their own childcare but have to accept whatever the state offers, or look after their children at home in poverty. </p> <p>What undermines Phillips's argument, however, is that it is based on the generalisation that when women become mothers their behaviour changes according to female instinct. She claims this is why nurturing children is crucial to a woman's identity whereas a father's identity is reliant on seeking work. Public policy, she argues, should reflect this fact and reward marriage as the ideal. Yet if anyone should make moral judgments about the best way to bring up children and conduct personal relationships - whatever their instincts - it is the people concerned, not politicians. This is what free choice means. </p> <p>Of course, a woman's decision may not guarantee happiness. Those who reject marriage and men are sometimes miserable and poor. Far from being a problem of too much 'selfish' choice, as Phillips argues, this shows how women's view of choice has narrowed. </p> <p>She is correct to say that a culture that celebrates women's physical independence from men as a panacea for all ills - emotional or economic - is a problem. It reduces women's choice in terms of relationships to either living alone or being enslaved in a marriage. This isn't the only way of looking at life. What about choosing to persevere with a partner who can help you? </p> <p>What she ignores, however, is how limited perceptions of economic choice influence women's lives. Arguing that it is not economic liberation which mothers need, but men, falls into the feminist and conservative trap: that society's economic problems can be resolved by changes in personal behaviour in relationships. </p> <p>So does feminism have anything to offer? Lynne Segal's new book <strong>Why Feminism?</strong> corrects the view that feminism means being anti-men. Like Phillips, she believes women can't chose to have it all. The difference is that Segal believes feminism offers a way for women to question society, using their experiences as a guiding rod to emancipation. Feminism provides the 'potential, however complex and difficult, to connect personal and cultural issues to economic and political affairs'. Refreshingly, she calls on women to become politically active and not just accept their identities. </p> <p>Yet how useful is personal experi ence in discussions of social progress? Segal argues that in an era when women's choices are circumscribed by welfare cuts, most mothers continue to 'prefer dependence on the state to their experience of dependence on a man'. No doubt all women (and men, for that matter) could cite an example where dependence on somebody caused disappointment, or worse. Nobody should be forced to be dependent on others, but strengthening their relationships with the state is no alternative. The state will always dictate the terms of the relationship. </p> <p>If this is all women have to look forward to, what kind of choice will they really have? </p>",

He is the guest of Balthus and his Japanese wife Setsuko in Switzerland. The great artist chain-smokes, but 'in the brief intervals between cigarettes, he was as scent-free as a little boy - if there was any odour at all that emanated from the octogenarian, it was butterscotch'. </p> <p>How close do you have to be to someone not only to detect a smell but to assert that he smells of nothing? During this visit to Balthus in 1990, Weber is, by his own account, star-struck and unquestioning, although this doesn't stop him from finding Balthus's alleged absence of aroma revealing as a symbol of a state of psychological arrest. Later, Weber becomes disillusioned, finding Balthus dishonest about his work and, worse, his ethnicity, and then there are no psychobiographical holds barred. </p> <p>Balthus was born in 1908 to Erich and Baladine Kolossowski, prosperous aesthetes and artists. When he was 11, his mother Baladine took as her lover no less a figure than Rainer Maria Rilke, who encouraged the boy's precocious talents. In fact, they collaborated on a book when Balthus was 14. </p> <p>Rilke wrote an essay introducing Balthus's drawings of a cat that a boy befriends and then loses. This sounds an enviably ideal start for an artist, but Weber proposes (without evidence) that the boy 'must have been constantly alert' to the ups and downs of passion between Rilke and Baladine, as a result of which the 'intertwining of ecstasy and torment would permeate Balthus's art forever after'. </p> <p>Clearly it's frustrating to have a painter willing to answer questions and then to hear him say that he paints what he sees, when his earlier work has an explicit sexual charge and even in his late paintings the young girls have a suspect glow. But artists are under no obligation to interpret their work. </p> <p>A quarter of this long book is devoted to the seven extraordinary paintings which made up Balthus's first solo exhibition in 1934. The artist has since owned up to a certain desire to shock, in images that combined a confrontational sexuality with classical control, but for Weber this was Balthus at his most honest about his obsessions. </p> <p>Yet, to make his case, he has to go in for a lot of misrepresentation. The distressed woman in The Window, for instance, does not, despite Weber, meet the viewer's eyes, and so cannot represent the victim of an assault by the artist. It's an intense reaction, but to something or someone we don't see. It's Weber who chooses to supply Balthus as her assailant, his paintbrush standing in for a knife. </p> <p>One painting at the 1934 show has been notorious ever since: The Guitar Lesson, where the (female) teacher plays the pupil rather than the instrument. Weber describes the teacher as digging talon-like fingers into the girl's inner thigh, though he also uses the less violent word 'strumming'. Describing The Guitar Lesson, Weber tries to establish an exact 'sequence of events', asserting that the teacher 'has probably given this sort of lesson before', while the pupil 'will grow from being a little girl in her cardigan and pinafore into a mature woman in seductive silk'. </p> <p>Is it art criticism to say of a painted figure that 'the girl's labia pulse'. In our century, and Freud's, psychological awareness has driven out the pictorial kind, a shift that Balthus both exploits and resists. </p> <p>These days, it is only confessions of trauma that are taken at face value. Perhaps he would have been cannier in presenting his art to the world to have done as his younger contemporary, Louise Bourgeois, did and insisted on the element of autobiography instead of declaring it off-limits. A Bourgeois sculpture is, in effect, firmly labelled, 'This is my revenge on daddy for betraying me by sleeping with the nanny', while Balthus has the labels attached by Weber instead. Art criticism as practised here is a sort of dismal centrifuge, whereby a picture is separated into layers of pigment and trauma. It is the precipitate of conjectural psychic damage which seems to hold the writer's attention. </p>",

The BBC will broadcast a tie-in called The Beginning of the End of the Affair. And the third and final volume of Greene's authorised biography, by Norman Sherry, is due this year. Amid the howling winds of hype, Shirley Hazzard modestly hopes that 'there is room for the remembrances of someone who knew [Greene] - not wisely, perhaps, but fairly well'. </p> <p>An esteemed novelist with a home on Capri, Hazzard and her late husband were among the few people Greene saw during visits to his own house on the island. Her memoir, Greene on Capri, a pointillist masterpiece, evokes a magical setting while realistically recreating conversations and unpleasant clashes with this most complicated man. She takes his measure down to his fingertips, noting how his palms curled from Dupuytren's contracture, and speculates that he suffered a similar emotional constriction. </p> <p>Despite Greene's expressed longing for 'peace', it was 'the last thing he desired'.

Failure and boredom, the feeling of loneliness, of being flat and empty, have more influence on a novelist.' </p> <p>He soon mentioned his mistress, Yvonne Cloetta.

      "bodyText": "A convergence of cultural vectors has brought Graham Greene back to centre stage. A film of The End of the Affair, starring Ralph Fiennes, has just been released. The BBC will broadcast a tie-in called The Beginning of the End of the Affair. And the third and final volume of Greene's authorised biography, by Norman Sherry, is due this year. Amid the howling winds of hype, Shirley Hazzard modestly hopes that 'there is room for the remembrances of someone who knew [Greene] - not wisely, perhaps, but fairly well'. An esteemed novelist with a home on Capri, Hazzard and her late husband were among the few people Greene saw during visits to his own house on the island. Her memoir, Greene on Capri, a pointillist masterpiece, evokes a magical setting while realistically recreating conversations and unpleasant clashes with this most complicated man. She takes his measure down to his fingertips, noting how his palms curled from Dupuytren's contracture, and speculates that he suffered a similar emotional constriction. Despite Greene's expressed longing for 'peace', it was 'the last thing he desired'. He frequently quarrelled with friends, displaying 'a playground will to hurt, humiliate, ridicule'. While he had a wicked sense of humour, 'Graham's pleasure in such jokes derived exclusively from spoofs practised by himself on others'. Would that I had known this before I met Greene. In 1972, I got Greene's address from, predictably, a priest, and wrote to the author. Though he was reputed to be wary of fawning readers and aspiring writers, he invited my wife and me for drinks. Summer nights in Antibes were no longer as tender as they had been during the time of Scott Fitzgerald. The streets of the resort were clotted with cars and smothered in the smell of fried food and Bain de Soleil. At a block of modern flats, I pressed the buzzer marked Green - was the deleted 'e' for disguise? - and entered a building that had the sterile impersonality of an airport. As Hazzard remarks: 'He was not attached, through habit or memory, or aesthetically, to the rooms and houses and neighbourhoods of his life.' Greene was taller than I expected and his apartment smaller - just a living/work space, bedroom and kitchen. Then 68, he stooped at the shoulders, as if listening closely and looking on with leaky blue eyes. The terrace door let in a din of cars and voices. 'The traffic goes on until all hours,' he lamented, 'and everyone in the building has a barbecue on his balcony. They keep me up half the night. Some mornings I'm almost too tired to work.' Greene had little knack for the continuity of conventional conversation. He preferred anecdotes. As he skipped from topic to topic, listeners had to keep up as best they could. 'I hate to say who I am or what I believe. I told an interviewer I'm gnostic. The next day's newspaper announced that I had become an agnostic.'

Even from there Rivaldo managed 24 goals last season. </p> <p>At nine o'clock next morning Van Gaal held his usual team meeting. At the end of it, Rivaldo asked to speak. He said something like this: 'I have respect for everyone here. But I will never play outside-left again.' A day later Van Gaal expelled him from the squad. </p> <p>Rivaldo was not thinking of the collective, he said. Rivaldo then went on holiday to Brazil. No one knows what will happen next. Whenever Van Gaal's team choices are questioned, he invokes the 'collective'. He says Rivaldo became European Player of the Year thanks only to Barcelona's collective. But when the coach says 'collective', he is really talking about himself. Serving the collective means obeying him. </p> <p>Van Gaal is not crazy. He knows that Rivaldo and Guardiola are great players. But last year everyone said Barcelona had won the league thanks to Rivaldo. Now, if Barcelona win the league, they won't be able to say that. They will have to say that Van Gaal built a strong collective. </p> <p>People also used to say that Van Gaal had barely changed the side. After all, Guardiola still ran things from midfield. Now nobody can say that either. This is Van Gaal's collective: youngsters, brilliant workers like Phillip Cocu and Luis Enrique, and no local heroes or annoying old guys set in their ways. It is a team chosen to suit Van Gaal's character, even if the coach himself does not fully realise it. </p> <p>At first, when he arrived at Barcelona, he tried to recreate the Ajax collective that won him the Champions League in 1995. He signed Patrick Kluivert, Winston Bogarde, Michael Reiziger, later the De Boers and Litmanen. Gradually, however, he must have spotted a change: they had grown older.

And so they have been cleansed. </p> <p>The new collective may win the league for the third time in three seasons, but the cules are turning off. The old heroes have gone. This is a foreign team, even if it has a few young local players. Van Gaal, who barely speaks Spanish let alone Catalan, who shows no liking for the most likeable city in Europe, has stolen the maiden Barca and imprisoned her in a Dutch tactical concept.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1969, I contributed several thumbnail sketches for a Sunday Times magazine project called 'The 1,000 Makers of the 20th Century', Fritz Lang among them. Lang, then aged 79, was living in California, his reputation seemingly unassailable. He was one of the great artists of the twentieth century, a member of that small group of directors - finite because their achievement could never be repeated - who had produced substantial bodies of work both in the silent era and after the coming of sound. He stood, I suggested, among the seminal artists of our time, one of the half-dozen greatest moviemakers. </p> <p>Twenty years later, and closer to the millennium, the same paper published a revised list. Lang was no longer among them. To find space for post-Seventies directors, the editors had decided that some oldsters had to go. It was as if Giotto had been dropped from The Story of Art to accommodate Damien Hirst. So the year 2000 and the new millennium could not have got off to a better start than with a National Film Theatre Fritz Lang retrospective that, together with its accompanying books and symposiums, should help restore his supremacy. </p> <p>Lang was born in Vienna in 1890, five years before the birth of the cinema, the half-Jewish son of a master-builder who he claimed was a leading architect. Like those other great Austro-Hungarian cinematic geniuses, Erich Von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, Lang created himself. </p> <p>Diligent biographers have exposed their lies, myths and seductive glosses, but nowadays we're inclined to accept the advice of the alcoholic newspaper editor in Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance : 'When the legend replaces the truth, print the legend.' But in addition to inventing himself, Lang - along with D.W. Griffith and Stroheim in the United States, Eisenstein and Pudovkin in Russia, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Stiller in Sweden - helped create the very idea of the filmmaker as uncompromising visionary. Together they turned the new profession of movie director into one of the grandest, most powerful, most heroic callings, not just of our century but of all time. </p> <p>The 29-year-old Lang entered the movies in Berlin formidably equipped. He'd studied architecture and law, exhibited paintings, travelled the world, served as an officer in the Austrian army and been wounded four times, published short stories and cartoons. While convalescing at a military hospital in the latter months of the Great War he sold screenplays to German producers. After less than a year as a script editor, he began directing, and over the next decade he made a succession of extravagant movies on vast sets and with long shooting schedules at the UFA studio. </p> <p>Gothic met Bauhaus in his morbid expressionist films and he established a reputation as an uncompromising, dictatorial perfectionist. He was one of the pioneers of the espionage melodrama, the paranoid urban thriller, the historical fantasy epic, the medieval allegory, the science fiction picture both in its dystopian mode (Metropolis) and its hardware rocketry form (Woman on the Moon, the film that invented the countdown). </p> <p>His megalomaniac super-criminal Dr Mabuse is the predecessor of Dr No and Dr Strangelove; Destiny lies behind Bergman's Seventh Seal, and Bergman's first German film, The Serpent's Egg , is an extended homage to Lang; the tyro Hitchcock watched Lang at work in Berlin; the young Kubrick studied his pictures; Star Wars and Blade Runner were anticipated by Lang. </p> <p>His pictures reflected the turbulence of Weimar Germany, a spiralling world of social conflict, unchecked inflation and rapid technological and moral change that led inexorably to the rise of Nazism. The politics of Lang's films were sufficiently confused to make him Hitler's favourite director, and when the Nazis came to power Goebbels offered him the job as head of the Third Reich's new film industry. This, after Lang's brilliantly innovative first talkie, M (1931), had commented ironically on the pact between German authority and the criminal underworld. </p> <p>Lang claims to have fled Berlin the day the Mephistophelean Goebbels made his offer, joining the greatest exodus of talent the world has ever known. He didn't work in Germany again until the late Fifties, when, in the twilight of his career, he made three minor works. </p> <p>Unlike other German exiles - Brecht, Mann, Schoenberg, for example - Lang immersed himself in American culture, driving around the country, reading local newspapers, talking to people, and studying comic strips, which he said gave him insights into slang and humour. But the admiration was reciprocal, because the most adventurous New York comic book editor, Jerry Iger, and his two major prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Will Eisner and Bob Kane (creator of Batman), were Lang fans. In The Great Comic Book Heroes Jules Feiffer writes: 'Eisner was an early master of the German expressionist approach in comic books - the Fritz Lang school... full of dark shadows, creepy angle shots, graphic close-ups of violence and terror.' </p> <p>The coming of sound and the move to America changed Lang's style. His themes remained the same: the quest for self-fulfilment or revenge turning to ashes, the conflict between free will and destiny, the irreconcilable attractions of the femme fatale and the domestic hearth, the relentlessness of a fate that makes a mockery of our dreams. But the abstract, stylised quality of his European pictures is replaced in the United States by a new solidarity and particularity, and fantasy is abandoned. </p> <p>'American pictures and audiences,' Lang observed, 'are more interested in the fate of the average man, of Joe Doe, whereas in Europe, especially in Germany, in the days before Hitler, they were more interested in a Nietzschean superman.' Consequently he chose to work with classless, unconventional looking heroes - Spencer Tracy (in Fury, Lang's devastating Hollywood debut, an indictment of vigilantism), and several times each with Edward G. Robinson, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford and Dana Andrews. </p> <p>Lang took immediately to the western, seeing it as a democratic development of the Nibelungen sagas, and Rancho Notorious (his only movie with Marlene Dietrich) is a bizarre classic of what was coming to be called the adult western. His Man Hunt helped create a new genre, the entertainment war flick, and his treatment of the Bonnie and Clyde story in You Only Live Once helped launch the Hollywood film noir , to which his fellow German emigr\u00e9s Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak and Edgar Ulmer contributed. Wilder acknowledges Lang's M as the chief stylistic influence on Double Indemity . </p> <p>Lang also upped the ante on screen violence, staging an almost unendurable fight to the death between Gary Cooper and Marc Lawrence as Lili Palmer looks on in Cloak and Dagger (1946), which Hitchcock borrowed 20 years later for Torn Curtain . </p> <p>He went beyond this to explore pain and disfigurement in The Big Heat (1953), in which Lee Marvin's inner beast emerged to throw a pot of scalding coffee in Gloria Grahame's face. The movie was a turning point in Marvin's career, as Clash By Night had been in Marilyn Monroe's the previous year, and M for Peter Lorre two decades earlier. </p> <p>For years it was the received wisdom that the poems Auden wrote before crossing the Atlantic, Hitchcock's British films and the movies Lang directed before his American exile, were deeper, richer, more truly serious than anything they produced after they arrived in the States. This is not true. Much of their best work was done there, not despite but because of the liberating, broadening effect of the exposure to America, the size and energy of the country. </p> <p>In Hollywood Lang never had the budgets the German cinema had afforded him, nor the respect. But he preserved his massive dignity and lived to see himself f ted as a master in the years before his death in 1976.

      "bodyText": "In 1969, I contributed several thumbnail sketches for a Sunday Times magazine project called 'The 1,000 Makers of the 20th Century', Fritz Lang among them. Lang, then aged 79, was living in California, his reputation seemingly unassailable. He was one of the great artists of the twentieth century, a member of that small group of directors - finite because their achievement could never be repeated - who had produced substantial bodies of work both in the silent era and after the coming of sound. He stood, I suggested, among the seminal artists of our time, one of the half-dozen greatest moviemakers. Twenty years later, and closer to the millennium, the same paper published a revised list. Lang was no longer among them. To find space for post-Seventies directors, the editors had decided that some oldsters had to go. It was as if Giotto had been dropped from The Story of Art to accommodate Damien Hirst. So the year 2000 and the new millennium could not have got off to a better start than with a National Film Theatre Fritz Lang retrospective that, together with its accompanying books and symposiums, should help restore his supremacy. Lang was born in Vienna in 1890, five years before the birth of the cinema, the half-Jewish son of a master-builder who he claimed was a leading architect. Like those other great Austro-Hungarian cinematic geniuses, Erich Von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, Lang created himself. Diligent biographers have exposed their lies, myths and seductive glosses, but nowadays we're inclined to accept the advice of the alcoholic newspaper editor in Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance : 'When the legend replaces the truth, print the legend.' But in addition to inventing himself, Lang - along with D.W. Griffith and Stroheim in the United States, Eisenstein and Pudovkin in Russia, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Stiller in Sweden - helped create the very idea of the filmmaker as uncompromising visionary. Together they turned the new profession of movie director into one of the grandest, most powerful, most heroic callings, not just of our century but of all time. The 29-year-old Lang entered the movies in Berlin formidably equipped. He'd studied architecture and law, exhibited paintings, travelled the world, served as an officer in the Austrian army and been wounded four times, published short stories and cartoons. While convalescing at a military hospital in the latter months of the Great War he sold screenplays to German producers. After less than a year as a script editor, he began directing, and over the next decade he made a succession of extravagant movies on vast sets and with long shooting schedules at the UFA studio. Gothic met Bauhaus in his morbid expressionist films and he established a reputation as an uncompromising, dictatorial perfectionist. He was one of the pioneers of the espionage melodrama, the paranoid urban thriller, the historical fantasy epic, the medieval allegory, the science fiction picture both in its dystopian mode (Metropolis) and its hardware rocketry form (Woman on the Moon, the film that invented the countdown). His megalomaniac super-criminal Dr Mabuse is the predecessor of Dr No and Dr Strangelove; Destiny lies behind Bergman's Seventh Seal, and Bergman's first German film, The Serpent's Egg , is an extended homage to Lang; the tyro Hitchcock watched Lang at work in Berlin; the young Kubrick studied his pictures; Star Wars and Blade Runner were anticipated by Lang. His pictures reflected the turbulence of Weimar Germany, a spiralling world of social conflict, unchecked inflation and rapid technological and moral change that led inexorably to the rise of Nazism. The politics of Lang's films were sufficiently confused to make him Hitler's favourite director, and when the Nazis came to power Goebbels offered him the job as head of the Third Reich's new film industry. This, after Lang's brilliantly innovative first talkie, M (1931), had commented ironically on the pact between German authority and the criminal underworld. Lang claims to have fled Berlin the day the Mephistophelean Goebbels made his offer, joining the greatest exodus of talent the world has ever known. He didn't work in Germany again until the late Fifties, when, in the twilight of his career, he made three minor works. Unlike other German exiles - Brecht, Mann, Schoenberg, for example - Lang immersed himself in American culture, driving around the country, reading local newspapers, talking to people, and studying comic strips, which he said gave him insights into slang and humour. But the admiration was reciprocal, because the most adventurous New York comic book editor, Jerry Iger, and his two major prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Will Eisner and Bob Kane (creator of Batman), were Lang fans. In The Great Comic Book Heroes Jules Feiffer writes: 'Eisner was an early master of the German expressionist approach in comic books - the Fritz Lang school... full of dark shadows, creepy angle shots, graphic close-ups of violence and terror.' The coming of sound and the move to America changed Lang's style. His themes remained the same: the quest for self-fulfilment or revenge turning to ashes, the conflict between free will and destiny, the irreconcilable attractions of the femme fatale and the domestic hearth, the relentlessness of a fate that makes a mockery of our dreams. But the abstract, stylised quality of his European pictures is replaced in the United States by a new solidarity and particularity, and fantasy is abandoned. 'American pictures and audiences,' Lang observed, 'are more interested in the fate of the average man, of Joe Doe, whereas in Europe, especially in Germany, in the days before Hitler, they were more interested in a Nietzschean superman.' Consequently he chose to work with classless, unconventional looking heroes - Spencer Tracy (in Fury, Lang's devastating Hollywood debut, an indictment of vigilantism), and several times each with Edward G. Robinson, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford and Dana Andrews. Lang took immediately to the western, seeing it as a democratic development of the Nibelungen sagas, and Rancho Notorious (his only movie with Marlene Dietrich) is a bizarre classic of what was coming to be called the adult western. His Man Hunt helped create a new genre, the entertainment war flick, and his treatment of the Bonnie and Clyde story in You Only Live Once helped launch the Hollywood film noir , to which his fellow German emigr\u00e9s Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak and Edgar Ulmer contributed. Wilder acknowledges Lang's M as the chief stylistic influence on Double Indemity . Lang also upped the ante on screen violence, staging an almost unendurable fight to the death between Gary Cooper and Marc Lawrence as Lili Palmer looks on in Cloak and Dagger (1946), which Hitchcock borrowed 20 years later for Torn Curtain . He went beyond this to explore pain and disfigurement in The Big Heat (1953), in which Lee Marvin's inner beast emerged to throw a pot of scalding coffee in Gloria Grahame's face. The movie was a turning point in Marvin's career, as Clash By Night had been in Marilyn Monroe's the previous year, and M for Peter Lorre two decades earlier.

      "body": "<p>Spike Lee has a vivid memory of the summer of 1977. 'It was a crazy time in New York, right before the Reagan years, like the last days of old Rome, people were just out there. There was no such thing as Aids, and in certain circles people were saying cocaine was not addictive.' </p> <p>In the simmering heat, a city-wide blackout led to outbreaks of mass looting. Disco was reaching its height and punk had emerged from the underground. And somewhere on the edge of the madness was 20-year-old college student Shelton Lee, back home for the summer. </p> <p>'I was an observer. To this day I have never done drugs. And I was nobody, nor did I have the money to get into Studio 54, and there was no way I was getting into [legendary orgy club] Plato's Retreat! I was still trying to get a girl to go with me to the movies, let alone a sex club.' </p> <p>He's laughing. 'First things first!' Instead, Lee wandered the city with a super-8 camera. 'I wasn't thinking \"I'm going to teach myself film-making\", I just picked up a camera and was shooting stuff. I didn't know what it was going to lead to when I was doing it.' </p> <p>That first experience of film-making distantly inspired Lee's new film, Summer Of Sam, set in 1977. </p> <p>'My memories are a lot of what's in the film.' But not the footage. 'I can't find it. I have it somewhere but I can't find it.' </p> <p>The story starts with the panic created by a serial murderer, known as the .44-killer and later the Son of Sam, who was terrorising the Italian-American community. </p> <p>'It was a very exciting time but it was also very scary. Son of Sam altered the way people lived their lives. You couldn't hang out, you couldn't sit in parked cars. People stayed shut in behind closed doors.' </p> <p>It is the effects of David Berkowitz's spree, rather than the killer himself, that Lee and scriptwriter/actors Michael Imperioli and Victor Colicchio were interested in. Wild, intense, startlingly shot and featuring excellent performances from John Leguziamo, Mira Sorvino and Jennifer Esposito, Summer Of Sam is one of the two or three best films Lee has ever made. </p> <p>It certainly carries echoes of his finest hour, Do The Right Thing . 'There are some parallels,' Lee admits, 'but some of that stuff I never even thought about until people brought it out in the reviews. The whole Italian-American thing is obvious, but I think if you look at the majority of my films they are about intolerance. </p> <p>'To me it's always been interesting when the lynch mob mentality takes place. It's human nature that we've got to finger someone. Whether they are guilty or not, we've got to hang somebody for the collective good. And in this case, in this film, in this neigh bourhood, [it is] Richie - a very fine performance by Adrien Brody - someone who is from the neighbourhood, but who has gone to the other world, the [Greenwich] Village - and has come back with the fake British accent and the spiked hair. To those guys he's the alien, the freak, so he has to be the Son Of Sam. Because only a serial killer would dress like that.' </p> <p>Interviews with Lee usually seem to end up as battles with journalists eager to take him to task for his supposed anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny, incitement to riot and hypocrisy. Lee, in these interviews, is alternately sulky and arrogant.But sitting in the Dorchester on a cold morning, there's nothing confrontational about him. Small, dressed in a sweat shirt and white trousers, the trademark baseball cap absent, he's a very youthful 42. He is not effusively friendly, but he's certainly not rude. His answers are short, but he takes every question seriously. He smiles, he laughs and he asks questions back. He's quick to credit his cinematographer (Ellen Kuras), editor (Barry Brown), writers and the actors. </p> <p>You'd have to say this is hardly the angriest man in America. Like most directors, he's all too eager to talk about the business of film-making. One of the first things he mentions about his next film - a satire about TV entitled Bamboozled - is that it was shot using the increasingly popular mini digital video format. 'But we're not doing a Dogme thing, we used lights.' </p> <p>Would he be tempted to make a film under the Dogme 95 rules (the school led by Danish director Lars Von Trier that required directors to go back to basics including using only natural light and hand-held cameras)? </p> <p>'No. I liked Festen but a filmmaker should use the tools that he has to tell the story - make-up, music, a particular lighting. Why not have a club for painters where the only colour we're going to use is red? To join this club, the Redme club, you have to use red. I don't understand the thinking behind that. Do they think they're getting the essence of film-making?' </p> <p>Lee's reliance on music would make a Dogme film tough for him to contemplate. Do The Right Thing was driven by its repeated use of Public Enemy's 'Fight The Power'; Summer Of Sam 's key sequences are edited to The Who's 'Baba O'Riley' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again'. </p> <p>'Music is a great tool of filmmaking. Maybe tool is not the right word. The way I operate I give the same respect to the music in my film as the cinematography, the production design, the acting, the editing; to me it's just as important a component as everything else. A lot of people might say \"you give too much importance to the music because I can't hear the dialogue\".' </p> <p>It follows that one of Lee's favourite films is West Side Story . 'I would love to do a full musical. And I will do one soon. I don't think it's an obsolete form. I do understand it is hard for audiences to deal with people talking one minute and the next they are breaking into song, but when you think about music videos it shouldn't be that strange.' </p> <p>If it seems unlikely that Lee should be keen on West Side Story , a film now frequently accused of being racist, then that's only the start of the ways that the standard image of the Spike-as-single-minded-polemicist doesn't fit. </p> <p>For a start, the great iconoclast works strictly within the Hollywood system. Since his second movie, School Daze , all his films - including Malcolm X - have had major studio involvement; Summer Of Sam was financed by Disney. </p> <p>Something else you should know about Lee: he's a family man first and foremost. He chooses his films keeping in mind the fact he doesn't want to be away from his children. 'I don't want to be an absentee husband or father. It's a concession I have no problem doing. So all my films will be shot in New York for a while.' He thinks about this. 'But they've been like that anyway.' </p> <p>For the man who scared so many people with Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X , Lee's politics are pretty mainstream too. He's put his money behind the moderate (white) presidential hopeful, Bill Bradley. </p> <p>'I'm a big supporter of Bradley. I like Clinton very much, but that allegiance doesn't have to translate to his V-P.' </p> <p>Nothing to do with the fact that Bradley used to play basketball for Lee's beloved New York Knicks? 'That had a little of something to do with it...' </p> <p>Finally, there's the talking dog. A friend of mine was hugely bothered by the scene in Summer Of Sam when a dog - voiced by Lee's constant collaborator John Turturro - talks to the Son Of Sam. </p> <p>'I think that fits perfectly with the chaos, the whole crazy time of the film,' Lee says. 'Here's a man who said a dog told him to go out and do this. So, we always felt that when we were in David Berkowitz's apartment that that's a different world. Who is to say that in that world dogs can't talk? He always said that Harvey, who he said was a 2,000-year-old black labrador, told him to go out and kill. So for us it made sense to show his state of mind.' </p> <p>But Lee has another explanation. A disarmingly simple one. 'We always felt that it was a very funny scene,' he says, hoping that what he's saying is obvious. 'Didn't you find it funny?' It is funny, as Spike Lee films normally are. </p> <p>Of course he is a cinematic troublemaker, but his best works are also sharply written, sexually charged, great-looking and - in the case of the unfairly dismissed Crooklyn - tender. He's anything but a one-dimensional man or director. Years ago, Lee used to say that he would make a film with predominantly white characters when Woody Allen made his black film. Now Lee's gone first: it's your move, Mr Allen. </p> <p>\u0095 Summer Of Sam is released on 14 January </p> <p><strong>Spike's way: Spike through the ages</strong></p> <p><strong> She's Gotta Have It </strong>(1986) <br> Lee's playful debut tracks the bedroom antics of the elusive Nola (Tracy Camila Johns) who juggles three men in her life, (one played by Lee himself, who often acts in his own films). Low on budget, high on invention, Lee's debut marked him out as a witty stylist to watch.</p> <p><strong> Do The Right Thing </strong> (1989) <br>In one of the key films of the Eighties, Lee concentrates on a long, hot day in the life of a Brooklyn neighborhood, where routine tensions and prejudices threaten to get out of hand. Fuelled by the music of Public Enemy, the film is by turns hilarious and shocking, and never stops asking questions about urban America. </p> <p><strong> Malcolm X </strong> (1992) <br>Lee's biopic of the civil rights leader was thought too anonymous by some. It certainly boasted fewer of the stylistic conceits of his earlier movies. But Lee marshalled a tricky narrative with authority and drew a fine performance from Denzel Washington as Malcolm X.</p> <p><strong> Clockers </strong> (1995) <br>Lee returns to the familiar territory of Brooklyn, in this adaptation of Richard Price's novel of the same name. Drugs and related violence provide the subject matter, and Lee, not wedded to camera trickery, offers up one of his most sober treatments, marked by impressive ensemble acting, an often overlooked feature of his work.</p>",

Something else you should know about Lee: he's a family man first and foremost. He chooses his films keeping in mind the fact he doesn't want to be away from his children. 'I don't want to be an absentee husband or father. It's a concession I have no problem doing. So all my films will be shot in New York for a while.' He thinks about this. 'But they've been like that anyway.' For the man who scared so many people with Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X , Lee's politics are pretty mainstream too. He's put his money behind the moderate (white) presidential hopeful, Bill Bradley. 'I'm a big supporter of Bradley. I like Clinton very much, but that allegiance doesn't have to translate to his V-P.' Nothing to do with the fact that Bradley used to play basketball for Lee's beloved New York Knicks? 'That had a little of something to do with it...' Finally, there's the talking dog. A friend of mine was hugely bothered by the scene in Summer Of Sam when a dog - voiced by Lee's constant collaborator John Turturro - talks to the Son Of Sam. 'I think that fits perfectly with the chaos, the whole crazy time of the film,' Lee says. 'Here's a man who said a dog told him to go out and do this. So, we always felt that when we were in David Berkowitz's apartment that that's a different world. Who is to say that in that world dogs can't talk? He always said that Harvey, who he said was a 2,000-year-old black labrador, told him to go out and kill. So for us it made sense to show his state of mind.' But Lee has another explanation. A disarmingly simple one. 'We always felt that it was a very funny scene,' he says, hoping that what he's saying is obvious. 'Didn't you find it funny?' It is funny, as Spike Lee films normally are. Of course he is a cinematic troublemaker, but his best works are also sharply written, sexually charged, great-looking and - in the case of the unfairly dismissed Crooklyn - tender. He's anything but a one-dimensional man or director. Years ago, Lee used to say that he would make a film with predominantly white characters when Woody Allen made his black film. Now Lee's gone first: it's your move, Mr Allen. \u0095 Summer Of Sam is released on 14 January Spike's way: Spike through the ages She's Gotta Have It (1986) Lee's playful debut tracks the bedroom antics of the elusive Nola (Tracy Camila Johns) who juggles three men in her life, (one played by Lee himself, who often acts in his own films). Low on budget, high on invention, Lee's debut marked him out as a witty stylist to watch. Do The Right Thing (1989) In one of the key films of the Eighties, Lee concentrates on a long, hot day in the life of a Brooklyn neighborhood, where routine tensions and prejudices threaten to get out of hand. Fuelled by the music of Public Enemy, the film is by turns hilarious and shocking, and never stops asking questions about urban America. Malcolm X (1992) Lee's biopic of the civil rights leader was thought too anonymous by some. It certainly boasted fewer of the stylistic conceits of his earlier movies. But Lee marshalled a tricky narrative with authority and drew a fine performance from Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. Clockers (1995) Lee returns to the familiar territory of Brooklyn, in this adaptation of Richard Price's novel of the same name. Drugs and related violence provide the subject matter, and Lee, not wedded to camera trickery, offers up one of his most sober treatments, marked by impressive ensemble acting, an often overlooked feature of his work.",

      "body": "<p>The 50 police officers staffing Scotland Yard's high-tech Gold Control Room spent the millennium celebrations fighting a sombre battle to prevent the estimated three million people crowding central London streets from falling into the Thames or being crushed, Hillsborough-style. The event started off far more quietly than expected, with fewer than 25,000 people turning out by 6pm. But as the evening progressed that rapidly changed as hundreds of thousands of revellers poured out of Tube stations or walked along special clearways towards the major attractions. With more than 6,000 officers on duty and fewer arrests than during previous new year's celebrations, Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston declared the event a huge success. Many of the revellers themselves, however, had a different story to tell. Although record number of police were on the streets, the vast majority were employed guarding road blocks or Tube stations. The surging crowds were mostly left to their own devices. Offences that would normally have resulted in arrest or caution were left unpunished. Hundreds of people openly smoked cannabis, and some waved their spliffs defiantly at nearby police, knowing they could not be caught in the huge crowds. But the police crowd control techniques had their critics. Thousands experienced extended periods of terror and panic as huge swathes of people surged forward, threatening to trample others underneath. Some people became hysterical. 'It was very scary for about an hour after 9.30pm, when the crowds seemed to be piling up out of control,' said one Samaritan witness, on duty below Hungerford Bridge, on the Embankment. 'I really thought there would be trouble because I could not see any police or stewards. There were no signs telling people where anything was.' At 9.30pm the police warned over loudspeakers that the Embankment was full. Anyone wanting to see the fireworks was urged to go to Tower Bridge. The warnings fell on deaf ears, with more than 200,000 attempting to walk the wrong way. Police urged them to turn back and go along Whitehall, but within minutes, the crush in Whitehall had become dangerous, and the police were forced to open up Whitehall Place to let some people down to the river. They closed it again within 10 minutes because of serious overcrowding by the Thames. Towards Blackfriars bridge, there was a crush that provoked sporadic fights before hundreds of revellers climbed over fencing to reach the safety of the gardens of the Inner and Middle Temple lawyers' chambers. Police shut the bridge to traffic at 6.30pm - hours earlier than originally planned - because of the crowds. 'You couldn't see what was happening. You couldn't move. Every now and then the crowd would surge one way or another, and I was terrified that I was going to fall over,' said Vicky Mitchell, a singer from Chelmsford. 'The police just seemed to be intent on keeping out of everyone's way.' At one point the police had to surround the Port of London Authority command headquarters, near Tower Bridge, to protect staff from the crowds. A PLA spokesman said: 'It looked like a riot was going off at one point.' Shortly before midnight, the police urged people to leave the Thames foreshore at Lambeth and Waterloo, fearing hundreds might end up in the river. The worst problems came at the end of the firework display. Around the South Bank as party-goers tried to make their way towards Waterloo station at 12.30am, many found themselves unable to move for more than an hour due to the sheer weight of numbers. Hundreds of families and babies in pushchairs were caught. Outside London, a large presence of families and a softy-softly policing style ensured few arrests. Only 200 were made in the whole of Wales, significantly fewer than in previous years. Police in Greater Manchester arrested about 100 people - a typical figure for any Friday night. There were just 24 arrests in Edinburgh, and 48 in the Strathclyde region, covering Glasgow. Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston of the Metropolitan police claimed the capital's low arrest figures were proof that the Met's approach had been correct. Despite evidence of illegal drug use on a wide scale, only three arrests were made in London for drugs offences. There were 99 arrests in total, 5 per cent fewer than last year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 50 police officers staffing Scotland Yard's high-tech Gold Control Room spent the millennium celebrations fighting a sombre battle to prevent the estimated three million people crowding central London streets from falling into the Thames or being crushed, Hillsborough-style. The event started off far more quietly than expected, with fewer than 25,000 people turning out by 6pm. But as the evening progressed that rapidly changed as hundreds of thousands of revellers poured out of Tube stations or walked along special clearways towards the major attractions. With more than 6,000 officers on duty and fewer arrests than during previous new year's celebrations, Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston declared the event a huge success. Many of the revellers themselves, however, had a different story to tell. Although record number of police were on the streets, the vast majority were employed guarding road blocks or Tube stations. The surging crowds were mostly left to their own devices. Offences that would normally have resulted in arrest or caution were left unpunished. Hundreds of people openly smoked cannabis, and some waved their spliffs defiantly at nearby police, knowing they could not be caught in the huge crowds. But the police crowd control techniques had their critics. Thousands experienced extended periods of terror and panic as huge swathes of people surged forward, threatening to trample others underneath. Some people became hysterical. 'It was very scary for about an hour after 9.30pm, when the crowds seemed to be piling up out of control,' said one Samaritan witness, on duty below Hungerford Bridge, on the Embankment. 'I really thought there would be trouble because I could not see any police or stewards. There were no signs telling people where anything was.' At 9.30pm the police warned over loudspeakers that the Embankment was full. Anyone wanting to see the fireworks was urged to go to Tower Bridge. The warnings fell on deaf ears, with more than 200,000 attempting to walk the wrong way. Police urged them to turn back and go along Whitehall, but within minutes, the crush in Whitehall had become dangerous, and the police were forced to open up Whitehall Place to let some people down to the river. They closed it again within 10 minutes because of serious overcrowding by the Thames. Towards Blackfriars bridge, there was a crush that provoked sporadic fights before hundreds of revellers climbed over fencing to reach the safety of the gardens of the Inner and Middle Temple lawyers' chambers. Police shut the bridge to traffic at 6.30pm - hours earlier than originally planned - because of the crowds. 'You couldn't see what was happening. You couldn't move. Every now and then the crowd would surge one way or another, and I was terrified that I was going to fall over,' said Vicky Mitchell, a singer from Chelmsford. 'The police just seemed to be intent on keeping out of everyone's way.' At one point the police had to surround the Port of London Authority command headquarters, near Tower Bridge, to protect staff from the crowds. A PLA spokesman said: 'It looked like a riot was going off at one point.' Shortly before midnight, the police urged people to leave the Thames foreshore at Lambeth and Waterloo, fearing hundreds might end up in the river. The worst problems came at the end of the firework display. Around the South Bank as party-goers tried to make their way towards Waterloo station at 12.30am, many found themselves unable to move for more than an hour due to the sheer weight of numbers. Hundreds of families and babies in pushchairs were caught. Outside London, a large presence of families and a softy-softly policing style ensured few arrests. Only 200 were made in the whole of Wales, significantly fewer than in previous years. Police in Greater Manchester arrested about 100 people - a typical figure for any Friday night. There were just 24 arrests in Edinburgh, and 48 in the Strathclyde region, covering Glasgow. Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston of the Metropolitan police claimed the capital's low arrest figures were proof that the Met's approach had been correct. Despite evidence of illegal drug use on a wide scale, only three arrests were made in London for drugs offences. There were 99 arrests in total, 5 per cent fewer than last year.",

And so it was, though not perhaps in the way anticipated by the spin doctors of the New Millennium Experience Company. For many of the 10,000 'ordinary people' (raffle-winners, zone-sponsor employees, New Labour stooges, mediacrats) who had submitted their personal details to the 'stringent security measures' we heard so much about as we lined up at Stratford tube, the Party of the Millennium was preceded by the Queue of the Apocalypse. As a party venue for 10,000, the Dome has a number of disadvantages. You cannot drive to it. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's as intimate as a diner-a-deux at Wembley Stadium (actually, it's two or three times the size). And in winter, it's freezing cold. The Dome is barely a bomb's throw from the East End that was flattened by the Luftwaffe, and on millennium night it was the spirit of the Blitz that got us all through. 'Let's all start singing \"Why Are We Waiting\",' said the woman behind me after two or three aeons of futile queueing. 'Well, I really do hope it's going to be worth the wait,' observed another, sourly. Pity the poor old Dome. It has, like the Government that ordered it into being, been abused, patronised, sneered at, and disparaged by the standing army of British bien pensants. From afar, and from the outside, it is a surprisingly British structure, not elegant or uplifting, but not unimpressive either. At night, it looks like a kind of intergalactic son et lumi\u00e8re, certainly not the Bilbao Guggenheim nor the Pompidou Centre, nor the renovated Reichstag, but with a comfortingly homemade British feel to it. I suspect that quite a few of the 10,000 who eventually filtered into the dark, draughty vastness of this cathedral of materialism for the first time were secretly proud of the place. Add to this the thought that, three years ago, when the incoming New Labour administration gave the project the green light, many people doubted that it could be completed on time (or on budget), and you have a typically British success-story: a compromise snatched from the jaws of indifference. Like it or loathe it, the Dome perfectly reflects our society. The party itself, 'one amazing night', also turned out to be as British as the Blitz. Packaged airline canapes and screw-top airline champagne were distributed, from 'hospitality points' to the guests as they made their way into the central arena. There was a scattering of celebrities, actors, historians, radio reporters, Cabinet Ministers and newspaper editors. Andrew Motion, the Poet Laureate, was there. So was Salman Rushdie, with Martin Amis. Among the many television executives scurrying about with mobile phones, the outgoing Director-General of the BBC, John Birt, rubbed shoulders with his successor, Greg Dyke. The presence of TV people was apt. The millennium show was Channel 5 meets BBC2. It was partly London Palladium (Stephen Fry), partly Butlins (Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra), and partly the Last Night of the Proms (Holst's Planets and massed millennium choirs). It was blander and more stage managed than a lifetime subscription to New Labour. It had everything a Millbank spin-doctor could wish for, even a gay choir. There was something English (Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra), something Welsh ('Cymru Fach') something old ('Amazing Grace') and something fairly new ('All You Need Is Love'). There was Handel's Let the Bright Seraphim, beautifully performed by Rosemary Joshua, and John Tavener's A New Beginning, brilliantly sung by David Wigram and Sumudu Jayatilaka. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, recited 'The Lord's Prayer', flanked by teenagers of different ethnic persuasions. As the new millennium dawned, Big Ben bonged the 10,000 into the New Era. The Queen joined in 'Auld Lang Syne' and (almost) linked hands with the Prime Minister. The organisers let off a lot of fireworks, and then the hordes of Peter Gabriel's Millennium Show swept across the central arena in a swirl of silks and banners. There is, I happen to know, a carefully worked out narrative to this show, but to the great majority of the 10,000 it was probably just an awesome display of aerial acrobatics and gymno-balletic synchronised movement. After this display of multi-cultural diversity, the national agenda reasserted itself and the 10,000, now acting as one, sang 'God Save The Queen'. Then the object of this homage gave quite a jolly millennial wave and the royal party left the party. After that the 10,000 hurried for the Stratford tube. If they got home before daybreak there'd be a good chance they could enjoy the whole event on television.</p>",

Home Secretary Jack Straw revealed in a congratulatory letter to the head of the Metropolitian police, Sir Paul Condon that there had been \"a series of bomb threats\" on millennium night and the days leading up to it.</p> <p>Sources said that one threat was at the Dome itself on Millennium night, though Blair was kept in the dark about it until yesterday.</p> <p>The north bank of the Thames around Big Ben had to be closed off for three hours because of the size of the crowd. Last night the Port of London Authority admitted that one man was missing after falling or jumping off Lambeth Bridge.</p> <p>A spokesman for the authority said last night: 'We are unlikely to recover him for some time. In such cases it usually takes 10 days for the river to return the body.'</p> <p>There were at least another four 'jumpers' during the celebrations. Three were pulled from the water and a fourth swam to shore, where he evaded the police by running into the crowd.</p> <p>But fears of a one-night crime wave proved to be unfounded. Crime was down 5 per cent on the previous New Year's Eve. There were only 99 arrests in central London. Along the Thames, 37 tons of explosives were safely detonated in Britain's biggest firework display.</p> <p>At about 3am yesterday Tony Blair and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, visited London Bridge fire station to praise the emergency services.</p> <p>In the morning Blair emerged from Downing Street to watch 12,000 marchers parade past a crowd of 1m through Whitehall and talk to members of the public.</p> <p>He told them: 'There was a fantastic atmosphere everywhere you went. You can still feel that this morning.</p> <p>'I have always been confident the Dome would be a success and last night really was breathtaking. I really do recommend you go and have a look.</p> <p>'It lived up to its billing and the fantastic thing is that millennium celebrations in this country go on for a year and not just today.</p> <p>'The easy thing to do would have been to scrap it [the Dome] when we came to power, but I really felt that would be a terrible missed opportunity. Greenwich Mean Time is known throughout the world as the home of time, so I really felt it was important to do something special and, believe me, if you go there it really is.</p> <p>'It is going to be great for tourism, jobs and help show Britain as a country confident about the future.</p> <p>'What struck me both last night and again today is this real sense of confidence and optimism. You just want to bottle it and keep it.'</p> <p>But not everyone was so happy. Fred Cutler from Plymouth waited more than four hours at a Tube station. Once in the Dome he said: 'This was the most disappointing night of my life. We have worked for years for a children's family charity, which is why we are here tonight, but what they don't realise is that we have given up a millennium night with our families, children and loved ones to be stuck in a queue for four hours and then told that we could not have a drink.'</p> <p>Dome organiser Jennie Page promised an investigation, but insisted the evening had been a success. She said: 'Yes, of course, I was getting information about the problems all through the night and various calls were made. We will analyse it all later today, but even for those people who were delayed they said they felt it was a fantastic success when they got there.'</p> <p>She said her team decided to continue serving food and drink after the show and to stay open until 4am - two hours longer than planned - because people had missed part of the evening.</p> <p>Michael Grade, the Chairman of the Creative Review Group for the Dome, also played down the problem. He said: 'This was a one off and we did get 12,500 people in and out of here safely. It was not something that you could rehearse. There is no comparative event.'</p>",

Home Secretary Jack Straw revealed in a congratulatory letter to the head of the Metropolitian police, Sir Paul Condon that there had been \"a series of bomb threats\" on millennium night and the days leading up to it. Sources said that one threat was at the Dome itself on Millennium night, though Blair was kept in the dark about it until yesterday. The north bank of the Thames around Big Ben had to be closed off for three hours because of the size of the crowd. Last night the Port of London Authority admitted that one man was missing after falling or jumping off Lambeth Bridge. A spokesman for the authority said last night: 'We are unlikely to recover him for some time. In such cases it usually takes 10 days for the river to return the body.' There were at least another four 'jumpers' during the celebrations. Three were pulled from the water and a fourth swam to shore, where he evaded the police by running into the crowd. But fears of a one-night crime wave proved to be unfounded. Crime was down 5 per cent on the previous New Year's Eve. There were only 99 arrests in central London. Along the Thames, 37 tons of explosives were safely detonated in Britain's biggest firework display. At about 3am yesterday Tony Blair and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, visited London Bridge fire station to praise the emergency services. In the morning Blair emerged from Downing Street to watch 12,000 marchers parade past a crowd of 1m through Whitehall and talk to members of the public. He told them: 'There was a fantastic atmosphere everywhere you went. You can still feel that this morning. 'I have always been confident the Dome would be a success and last night really was breathtaking. I really do recommend you go and have a look. 'It lived up to its billing and the fantastic thing is that millennium celebrations in this country go on for a year and not just today. 'The easy thing to do would have been to scrap it [the Dome] when we came to power, but I really felt that would be a terrible missed opportunity. Greenwich Mean Time is known throughout the world as the home of time, so I really felt it was important to do something special and, believe me, if you go there it really is. 'It is going to be great for tourism, jobs and help show Britain as a country confident about the future. 'What struck me both last night and again today is this real sense of confidence and optimism. You just want to bottle it and keep it.' But not everyone was so happy. Fred Cutler from Plymouth waited more than four hours at a Tube station. Once in the Dome he said: 'This was the most disappointing night of my life. We have worked for years for a children's family charity, which is why we are here tonight, but what they don't realise is that we have given up a millennium night with our families, children and loved ones to be stuck in a queue for four hours and then told that we could not have a drink.' Dome organiser Jennie Page promised an investigation, but insisted the evening had been a success. She said: 'Yes, of course, I was getting information about the problems all through the night and various calls were made. We will analyse it all later today, but even for those people who were delayed they said they felt it was a fantastic success when they got there.' She said her team decided to continue serving food and drink after the show and to stay open until 4am - two hours longer than planned - because people had missed part of the evening. Michael Grade, the Chairman of the Creative Review Group for the Dome, also played down the problem. He said: 'This was a one off and we did get 12,500 people in and out of here safely. It was not something that you could rehearse. There is no comparative event.'",

No Queen, no Prime Minister Superstar, no suits, no Janus-faces jostling for power and position, only a press of ordinary Londoners relishing and fearing the bitter-sweet cut of time - of where were you? Licensed madness was in the air. A woman in a nightie had her picture taken cuddling a policeman in his dayglo livery. A clamper lorry seeped by, attracting a vortex of boos, until someone brave enough went over and kissed the driver. How much are you being paid? 'Thirty pounds an hour,' said the poor wretch, 'and it's not enough.' Everyone started loving him. Time accelerated and, with a great orgasmic shout, the crowd roared out that the M-spot had been hit and the two hands of Big Ben were as one. A black guy fizzed up his bottle of champagne and sprayed his kids, his wife, the party of Spaniards squashed against the bridge balustrade, the Kiwi opera singer, the former Page Three star - was it Jilly Johnson? Gosh! - the beautiful French woman, the GMTV presenter, the spectacularly crude Australian, the senior press officer for the Department of Health and the psycho-neurotic drunk who kept on chewing broken glass bottles - ordinary Londoners every one - and the fireworks began. Guy Fawkes would have loved them. At one moment Big Ben disappeared in a cloud of red fire, and one saw London as it must have been during the Blitz, buildings emerging from flickering flames. The smoke, the repeated booms, punched away at the senses like heavy artillery having a good time. The final flourish was the blue stars dropping down from a Blair heaven: subliminal Europhilia? Or pretty blue stars? No one cared. It was a brilliant moment to be alive, and in the world's most exciting city. Opera singer Paul Whelan sang 'Auld Lang Syne' in a fine baritone, but with so many complete strangers - especially the psychopath - the critical mass of hand-wringing did not take off. GMTV reporter Penny Smith and the vulgar Australian competed for the perfect metaphor. Penny: 'The earth definitely moved \u0085 even if the River of Fire didn't show me just how fast it was moving.' The Ozzie replied: 'The millennium? Like sex for an Australian, it was over in a second.' He then started filling my plastic cup with Sauterne, which was totally disgusting. But what about the cock-ups? The River of Fire? Impossible to see from where I was in the sardine tin. The Dons were closest to the Thames. Was the River of Fire any good? 'Que?' asked a Spaniard. Speaking my best Basil Fawlty Spanish, I bawled: 'Rivieria del fuelgo?' 'Que?' 'Donda est rivieriar \u0085 sorry \u0085 rio del fuego?' 'Que?' This went on for about half an hour and eventually it came out that he hadn't seen it. The unmoving Eye? Blame the French. It was their pods that buggered up. I launched into an Edward Heath-style interrogation of the beautiful Frenchwoman, who treated me with Gallic disdain, before declaring: 'Zee wheel was bughreded oop on porpoise.' Later inquiries have shown that the offending piece of machinery was a clutch, one made in Germany. Sounds like a case for Biggles, if you ask me. Then the police started shooing us off the bridge with a sweet patience which was rewarded, too often, with moronic abuse. The psychopath gobbled up the last of his bottle. One should not play down the bitter-sweetness of it all. Some loved ones were missing at that cruel knife-slash of time; one woman close by the James Bond building, the headquarters of MI6 at Vauxhall Cross, sobbed uncontrollably into a mobile phone. Children looked, more often than not, scared rather than happy. One poor soul leapt off Lambeth Bridge at some point in the night, and is still missing. Others had little time to celebrate and were getting on with the job of making London tick. Like the police. Like the health workers. Like the public transport workers. The noble sadness of not being in the right place at the right time when God - or whoever - wound our sundials into the third millennium was most beautifully expressed for ordinary people by a Tube driver on the Bakerloo Line, running from Oxford Circus to Lambeth North on millennium night. 'When I was seven or eight I remember looking forward to the millennium and thinking how far away it was and here it is tonight. I wanted to be a pilot. I ended up as a Tube driver. But it's a good job. And London Underground's a good company to work for. Even if I never did make it as a pilot. More a submarine pilot. 'Happy new millennium.'</p>",

Extra volunteers are on call to listen to those who have found themselves unable to cope with the celebration imperative. 'We will get a lot of calls from people who have had huge expectations of having the night of their life and they won't have done,' said Alison Weisselberg, the national co-ordinator for youth and a volunteer working on New Year's Eve.</p> <p>'They'll have had a row or broken up - all those things that happen at these crucial times. A lot of young people will be affected by that. The expectations have been greater than usual because of the millennium. The despair afterwards, when people realise their problems have not gone away, will be greater.'</p> <p>A mobile Samaritan unit offered help to all comers throughout Millennium Eve, from police officers seeking paracetamol to young people mourning lost loves.</p> <p>During the worst of the crush the Samaritans unit also fielded inquiries for practical help to those seeking first-aid centres or means of taking their young child-ren away from the crowds. 'There was never a moment without a caller,' said Lois, a volunteer.

      "bodyText": "This weekend will be one of the busiest ever for Britain's Samaritans. Extra volunteers are on call to listen to those who have found themselves unable to cope with the celebration imperative. 'We will get a lot of calls from people who have had huge expectations of having the night of their life and they won't have done,' said Alison Weisselberg, the national co-ordinator for youth and a volunteer working on New Year's Eve. 'They'll have had a row or broken up - all those things that happen at these crucial times. A lot of young people will be affected by that. The expectations have been greater than usual because of the millennium. The despair afterwards, when people realise their problems have not gone away, will be greater.' A mobile Samaritan unit offered help to all comers throughout Millennium Eve, from police officers seeking paracetamol to young people mourning lost loves. During the worst of the crush the Samaritans unit also fielded inquiries for practical help to those seeking first-aid centres or means of taking their young child-ren away from the crowds. 'There was never a moment without a caller,' said Lois, a volunteer. 'Some had histories of mental ill-health, others needed to know they were not alone. 'But we will be even busier over the weekend and tomorrow when people wake up realising they have to go back to work and that it hasn't really been a great, new dawn.' The Samaritans expect people to divide into two groups: those now so relieved to have survived all their millennium fears intact that they are enjoying a kind of euphoria, and those - mostly young - who expected wonderful things and are now disillusioned.

Trent ambulance service reported its busiest night since records began, while London Ambulance Service responded to 2,500 calls. At St Thomas's, London, Steve from Acton, supported by his friend, defiantly limped off to take a champagne break from queuing, returning crestfallen after Steve fell over and saw his precious bottle explode on the tarmac. Between midnight and 8am St Thomas's A&amp;E had seen 300 patients. The 21 nurses and nine doctors worked under intense pressure and for far longer than their usual 10-hour shifts.

      "bodyText": "Ann Pettifor, Director of Jubilee 2000, which campaigns for an end to Third World debt My fervent hope is for a Copernican shift: from a money-centred world to a human-centred world. For the subordination of money values to human and environmental values. For people and planet to enjoy the awe and respect now accorded to wealth. Craig Raine, Poet I hope to have more meals in the River Caf\u00e9 and for an improvement in my skiing and to live to read T.S. Eliot's correspondence with Emily Hale, which is embargoed until 2015. I also hope that Richard Holmes's biography of Coleridge is the last time that biography is turned into criminography. Tom Paulin, Poet and broadcaster I just hope that the peace process in Northern Ireland keeps working. Professor Richard Dawkins, Oxford University The five millennia of recorded history have been darkened by supernaturalism and irrational superstition. I hope, but do not expect, that during the coming millennium reason's sun will rise. Sir George Young, Former Transport Secretary I hope someone will reinvent shoe-laces that stay tied; car side-lights that don't blow once a quarter; telephones that are answered by a real person; newsprint that doesn't come off on your hand and bank statements that show where you spent your cheques. Lord Peter Melchett, Executive director of Greenpeace We have to meet our needs without poisoning, eroding, burning and destroying the systems that support all life on earth. At least the millennium will start with the renewable energy century, as clean wind, wave and solar power take over from polluting oil and coal, and nuclear comes to an unlamented and overdue death. Lembit Opik, MP for Montgomeryshire, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Ulster I'm glad to say 'bye' to the Black Death, most slavery, the Troubles (c 1540-1999), some famine, some war, Krakatoa and the Bay City Rollers. Next millennium, I hope we say 'yes' to colonising the solar system, a Grand Unified Theory of Physics, a better sense of what God's all about, less war, and at a personal level, better health for my mother. Stelios Haji-Ioannou, Chairman of EasyJet I wish for health, peace and prosperity for all people. I hope to continue doing my bit in reducing the cost of goods and services to consumers. Sir John Drummond, Former controller of Radio 3 My hope is for a world without management consultants, public relations firms, focus groups or strategies. And an enthusiastic farewell to John Birt. Darcus Howe, Broadcaster I hope for absolute equality and a revitalisation of English cricket. Chris Holmes, Director of Shelter The millennium marks 2000 years from the day when the Christian Church remembers the birth of Jesus in a stable - because there was 'no room in the inn'. It is a scandal that in a society as rich as Britain today, more than 2,000 homeless people sleep on the streets every night, and almost 7,000 homeless families will spend this Christmas in bed and breakfast hotels. My hope is that we will enable everyone to live in a decent, safe and affordable home - and that we make a commitment for that to be possible for people throughout the world. Mark Thomas, Broadcaster and comedian I would like Cherie Blair to give birth to a black baby. I also hope there will be an anarcho-zen transfer of power from those that have it to those that don't. I would like to see the back of everything to do with Chris Tarrant and Christianity. There should be a rehabilitation scheme for priests to help them pack it in and the empty churches should be turned into theme pubs. All the gold crucifixes and rings could be melted into a huge block, reading 'Sorry - we were wrong'. Jo Hamilton, Member of environmental pressure group Genetix Snowball My hopes: people co-operating to take positive action to create a just and diverse world; an end to cynicism, isolation and the mono-culture of global capitalism. The Dalai Lama, Religious leader The most important thing is transforming our minds, so that we have a new way of thinking and a new outlook. We should make an effort to develop a new inner world. For centuries, and for generations, humanity has invested all its effort into developing society in terms of material facilities, on the basis of science and technology. The world at large, and particularly the Western nations, have achieved very high living standards, yet a lot of problems remain. Barbara Follett,MP for Stevenage New ways of thinking and new ways of doing are my hopes. Out with the old 'this is how we have always done it' dogma and in with the 'let's try it this way' approach. Adrian Noble, Artistic director, Royal Shakespeare Company As the new technology and digitalisation transform our society, I would like to see a recognition of the increasingly important role of live performance. Theatre can be a spiritually revitalising, politically alert and exhilarating medium, but we need to safeguard the future by securing the training of our young artists, properly rewarding our writers, and accepting once and for all that subsidy can directly contribute to our democracy, in a civilising as well as pecuniary way.

Martin Bell, MP for Tatton I hope for a more peaceful future in which civilians aren't targeted in warfare, the Geneva Convention is observed and children can live their childhood in peace and freedom. Luciana Morad, Mother of the latest addition to Mick Jagger's growing family, Lucas. I am looking forward to seeing my son's first steps and a happier and more sincere world. Helen Carey,Chairman of the Women's Institutes We all need to have an understanding of our world, the countryside, the environment and the part we can play in it. This is why I believe so strongly in Agenda 21- the action plan for a sustainable way of life that involves and empowers people to make decisions for their own communities. Alan Bleasdale, Playwright I would wish for the defeat of racism and nationalism; for the ending of Third World debt; for advances in medicine that save people's lives rather than enhance the prospects of longevity for the rich. On a personal level, I would like a teddy bear to go with those childish hopes and dreams. Glenda Jackson, MP for Hampstead and Highgate There is one thing I would like to see finally arrive: women are half the population of the world and should be sitting in half the legislative seats in the world. Paul Thompson, Director of the Design Museum At a local level I look forward to the introduction of decent bus and cycle lanes within our city centres; a greater understanding of the significance of design and technology within the National Curriculum; and a secure future for our green belts, underpinned by EU support for organic farming. At a global level: an end to the nineteenth-century concept of the nation-state and the consequent ethnic cleansing. John Humphrys, Presenter, Radio 4 My hope: that politicians of all hues will finally realise we have only one countryside and if they screw it up any more it will be past recovery. That's nothing to do with fox-hunting and everything to do with trees and hedges and chemical pollution. Michael Dibdin, Author Welcome to an integrated European Union containing over 500 million of the brightest and best people on earth, each speaking two other EU languages and understanding at least three others. Farewell to the horrors which made this both possible and necessary. Ben Gill, President of the National Farmers' Union My wish is for a new-found return of optimism to British farmers based on sustainable farm incomes to secure the core maintenance of our rural communities and our beautiful British countryside.

I hope that the combination of movies, mating, matches and much more continues to bring commercial success for our shareholders and that I remain working with the most talented team in broadcasting. Mariella Frostrup, Broadcaster I'd like to see the Internet - a medium that was supposed to enfranchise everyone and usher in a utopia of information and education, and has so far only created a few young millionaires - actually make good on its potential and create the global village we were all expecting. Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate My hopes are all wearied by repetition - wearied but undaunted: peacefulness; greater equality; mutual respect and understanding; a curb to global capitalism; the cancellation of Third World Debt. John Simpson, BBC world affairs editor What would give me the greatest pleasure to report on in the next two or three years is an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Angola. These wars are entirely unnecessary and could be stopped within a week with a minimum of diplomatic effort and money from Western governments. John Monks, General secretary, TUC Over the next century I want to see trade unionism as relevant to millions more workers as it has been in the past century. This means in the UK trade unions penetrating IT, call centre, leisure and hospitality industries. Worldwide, it means recognising that globalisation must be accompanied by the spread of decent environmental, labour and social standards - not as an afterthought but as a condition. James Boyle, Controller, Radio 4 We should all hope for an end to the poison of racism which has blighted the last 2000 years.

I'm looking forward to a Bladerunner-style future, all noodle bars and giant adverts so I can replace my friends with replicants that look like Rutger Hauer and who'll be nice to me.

Through Friday and Saturday, some 28 hours of television took the viewer on an awesome, globe-shrinking journey - a technological hand-across-the-water and a fitting end to a century of bombastic imagery.</p> <p>There were glitches, but remarkably few. The triumphs tended to be quiet, if only because silence and space are such precious commodities in a medium that necessarily abhors a vacuum; while the big bangs were markedly less successful - fireworks do not, on the whole, make great TV. And there were a lot of fireworks.</p> <p>After what sounded like a miserable five days on a tramp steamer travelling to Kiribati from Christmas Island, John Simpson pitched up on a coral beach under the stars and gave us the first midnight, in the South Pacific, at 10am. The region's President, Simpson told us, had come to power on the promise that he would reorganise the international dateline so that the islands were no longer divided by time; while Tonga had allocated themselves another hour of daylight saving just so that it could become the first inhabited place to usher in all our tomorrows.</p> <p>Back in the fussy, over-designed BBC studio - Was that a Charlie Dimmock water feature? Why the gauche rune-style 2000 logo? - anchors Michael Parkinson and Gaby Roslin proved a surprisingly successful combination. Gaby wore five different outfits, gushed and was regularly, if mostly just professionally, 'moved'; while Parky kicked off just this side of businesslike and ended up, rather deliciously, quite excited.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Peter Snow struggled with a sore throat as he kept a weather eye for potential millennium buggery, and Peter Sissons reminded us, if we cared, that there was some other news in the world out there - Yeltsin's resignation, the end of the Indian Airline hostage crisis, George Harrison's party-pooping partially collapsed lung.</p> <p>Messy lives apparently continued to unfold even as we marked time, waiting for something bigger.</p> <p>Then it was Britain's midday: 'The next time it strikes 12 after this it will be the start of the millennial year. Gosh, we're full of trivial information here!' said Sissons, cheerily.</p> <p>Gaby was moved by the idea of the last midday, but Parky was non-plussed.</p> <p>A sudden spate of firsts: weddings, bungee jumps and babies in New Zealand.</p> <p>And no millennial meltdown. Yet. 'How is your throat, Peter?' Gaby asked Snow. 'Quite interesting,' he replied before telling that, having come through Red Alert (high risk), Amber (a bit of risk) we were now on a Blue millennium bug alert. Barely any risk at all, apparently.</p> <p>At a Sikh temple in Leicester we learnt that it was 2056 in the Hindu calendar. And that Lerwick has more musicians per head of the population than anywhere other than Nashville. Lots of people were getting married in Beijing, and there were police boats breathalysing revellers on the water in Sydney Harbour. The world was shrinking so fast we needed more and more on-screen information about where we were.</p> <p>I cried when it was Sydney's turn - my mother and brother live nearby. But Sydney threw down the pyrotechnological gauntlet and looked stunning. Hours later, on ITV, Bob Geldof told Trevor McDonald, 'Ours will be bigger than Sid's'. Had I misheard? No, it turned out that Sid was, fittingly, the pyrotechnician in charge of lighting Sydney. Not that this was meant to be a competition, surely?</p> <p>Gloom in Muckle Flugga, Britain's first sunset ('When you see that, you think there might be another world,' said Peter Sissons, caught up in it now), acts of remembrance in Nottingham, sunset-chasing in Tornado jets.</p> <p>Michael Palin, OBE, turned up to show us Bj\u00f6rk in Reykjavik, Inca ceremonies at Macchu Pichu, stiltwalkers at Uluru, a German boys choir at sunset in Nazareth, while at 4.16pm Gaby told us, 'Now it's time to beat the retreat in Plymouth with Angela Rippon.'</p> <p>I was getting a bit dizzy, teary.</p> <p>Two thousand voices sang Danny Boy in Ulster and people were starting to cheer in the street outside my flat. The big quiz, 2000 to One, turned out to be a damp squib because Duncan, the bearded man who looked exactly like Jesus, was beaten by John, who wore a sensible sweater. John was a 'personal empowerment coach'. How very 1999.</p> <p>According to presenter Tim Vincent, 'the greatest party the world has ever seen' was in Cardiff. I doubted that. 'It's beginning to build up to something now, isn't it?' admitted Parky at 9pm - midnight in Moscow.</p> <p>There was another picture of the Auckland baby, born at 12.01 NZ time, but we still didn't know what gender it was, though it was obviously more of a metaphor than a baby.</p> <p>Then we were in South Africa. Michael Buerk couldn't stop himself from talking, non-stop and knowledgeably, but I wished he'd shut up because this was one of those quiet, understated moments that really could have moved both me and Gaby. No fireworks, just Nelson Mandela returning to his old cell at Robben Island to light a candle.</p> <p>It was in stark contrast to the Queen's efforts to light a Thames-side fuse a little later. Lighters and candles tend to do the job, but London was in danger of getting caught out by the grand, empty gesture.</p> <p>It may be the year 5760 for Jews, but over in Bethlehem they played Also Sprach Zarathustra - the theme from 2001 - so it still felt like the wrong year; while Jean Michel Jarre was doing a big and pompous son et lumi\u00e8re at the Pyramids, so it felt a bit like 1980.</p> <p>At 11pm, I switched over to ITN and Trevor McDonald. As The Bay City Rollers sang 'I Only Want To Be With You' in Edinburgh, in Paris the Eiffel Tower was giving off white sparks. We could do better than that, surely?</p> <p>Inside the Dome with the Queen and Tony Blair, the atmosphere never looked very merry and a phone call from a Dome-bound friend - 'The bar is shut already!' - seemed to confirm it. No, the River looked the place to be, though John Suchet told us there were worries about crowd safety.</p> <p>Midnight. I wanted to feel something more than I felt, but I was tired with anticipation. ITV hedged its bets by splitting the screen three ways: Bongs from Big Ben, the River of Fire and a tiny McDonald in the top right-hand corner. Less would have been more, but I think Geldof was right, we did beat Sydney - not that it was ever a competition, surely?</p> <p>And then, shockingly suddenly, I realised I had been taken into tomorrow and that there was probably never going to be an antidote to the sense of anti-climax because I hadn't looked that far ahead. The only response was to hit the Off button and sleep while somewhere else celebrated because, of course, it really didn't matter anymore. Wherever you were at the beginning of the 21st century - even in front of the TV - you were there.</p>",

Gaby wore five different outfits, gushed and was regularly, if mostly just professionally, 'moved'; while Parky kicked off just this side of businesslike and ended up, rather deliciously, quite excited. Meanwhile, Peter Snow struggled with a sore throat as he kept a weather eye for potential millennium buggery, and Peter Sissons reminded us, if we cared, that there was some other news in the world out there - Yeltsin's resignation, the end of the Indian Airline hostage crisis, George Harrison's party-pooping partially collapsed lung. Messy lives apparently continued to unfold even as we marked time, waiting for something bigger. Then it was Britain's midday: 'The next time it strikes 12 after this it will be the start of the millennial year. Gosh, we're full of trivial information here!' said Sissons, cheerily. Gaby was moved by the idea of the last midday, but Parky was non-plussed. A sudden spate of firsts: weddings, bungee jumps and babies in New Zealand. And no millennial meltdown. Yet. 'How is your throat, Peter?' Gaby asked Snow. 'Quite interesting,' he replied before telling that, having come through Red Alert (high risk), Amber (a bit of risk) we were now on a Blue millennium bug alert. Barely any risk at all, apparently. At a Sikh temple in Leicester we learnt that it was 2056 in the Hindu calendar. And that Lerwick has more musicians per head of the population than anywhere other than Nashville. Lots of people were getting married in Beijing, and there were police boats breathalysing revellers on the water in Sydney Harbour. The world was shrinking so fast we needed more and more on-screen information about where we were. I cried when it was Sydney's turn - my mother and brother live nearby. But Sydney threw down the pyrotechnological gauntlet and looked stunning. Hours later, on ITV, Bob Geldof told Trevor McDonald, 'Ours will be bigger than Sid's'. Had I misheard? No, it turned out that Sid was, fittingly, the pyrotechnician in charge of lighting Sydney. Not that this was meant to be a competition, surely? Gloom in Muckle Flugga, Britain's first sunset ('When you see that, you think there might be another world,' said Peter Sissons, caught up in it now), acts of remembrance in Nottingham, sunset-chasing in Tornado jets. Michael Palin, OBE, turned up to show us Bj\u00f6rk in Reykjavik, Inca ceremonies at Macchu Pichu, stiltwalkers at Uluru, a German boys choir at sunset in Nazareth, while at 4.16pm Gaby told us, 'Now it's time to beat the retreat in Plymouth with Angela Rippon.' I was getting a bit dizzy, teary. Two thousand voices sang Danny Boy in Ulster and people were starting to cheer in the street outside my flat. The big quiz, 2000 to One, turned out to be a damp squib because Duncan, the bearded man who looked exactly like Jesus, was beaten by John, who wore a sensible sweater. John was a 'personal empowerment coach'. How very 1999. According to presenter Tim Vincent, 'the greatest party the world has ever seen' was in Cardiff. I doubted that. 'It's beginning to build up to something now, isn't it?' admitted Parky at 9pm - midnight in Moscow. There was another picture of the Auckland baby, born at 12.01 NZ time, but we still didn't know what gender it was, though it was obviously more of a metaphor than a baby. Then we were in South Africa. Michael Buerk couldn't stop himself from talking, non-stop and knowledgeably, but I wished he'd shut up because this was one of those quiet, understated moments that really could have moved both me and Gaby. No fireworks, just Nelson Mandela returning to his old cell at Robben Island to light a candle. It was in stark contrast to the Queen's efforts to light a Thames-side fuse a little later. Lighters and candles tend to do the job, but London was in danger of getting caught out by the grand, empty gesture. It may be the year 5760 for Jews, but over in Bethlehem they played Also Sprach Zarathustra - the theme from 2001 - so it still felt like the wrong year; while Jean Michel Jarre was doing a big and pompous son et lumi\u00e8re at the Pyramids, so it felt a bit like 1980. At 11pm, I switched over to ITN and Trevor McDonald. As The Bay City Rollers sang 'I Only Want To Be With You' in Edinburgh, in Paris the Eiffel Tower was giving off white sparks. We could do better than that, surely? Inside the Dome with the Queen and Tony Blair, the atmosphere never looked very merry and a phone call from a Dome-bound friend - 'The bar is shut already!' - seemed to confirm it. No, the River looked the place to be, though John Suchet told us there were worries about crowd safety. Midnight. I wanted to feel something more than I felt, but I was tired with anticipation. ITV hedged its bets by splitting the screen three ways: Bongs from Big Ben, the River of Fire and a tiny McDonald in the top right-hand corner. Less would have been more, but I think Geldof was right, we did beat Sydney - not that it was ever a competition, surely? And then, shockingly suddenly, I realised I had been taken into tomorrow and that there was probably never going to be an antidote to the sense of anti-climax because I hadn't looked that far ahead. The only response was to hit the Off button and sleep while somewhere else celebrated because, of course, it really didn't matter anymore. Wherever you were at the beginning of the 21st century - even in front of the TV - you were there.",

They are an attractive couple - a boy emperor and his old teacher, the intellectual pope. Together they decided to bring back the Christian empire that Charlemagne had tried to create among the warring tribes of Western Europe.</p> <p>If Charlemagne was the Jean Monnet of the 800s, Otto III was the Romano Prodi of the 900s. Otto was only 14 when he became king of Germany. From boyhood, he took very seriously the idea of a united Christendom, a Holy Roman Empire. Like so many over-active, over-educated boys of that period, he was a natural general, winning battles in a Germany that rather resembled the China of Confucius's era, a time known as that of 'the warring duchies'.</p> <p>By 16, King Otto was crowned Emperor of the West. An intellectual snob, he despised what he called 'Saxon rusticity' and he favoured what he termed Greek or Byzantine 'subtlety'. He even dreamed of sailing to Byzantium to bring together all Christendom under his rule, which was, in turn, under that of God. In this sublime enterprise, he was guided by his old tutor, a French scholar named Gerbert.</p> <p>As a sign of solidarity - not to mention morbidity - Otto even opened up the tomb of Charlemagne and paid his great predecessor a visit. The dead emperor was seated on a throne. According to an eyewitness, only a bit of his nose had fallen off but his fingernails had grown through his gloves and so, reverently, Otto pared them and otherwise tidied him up. Can one imagine Prodi - or even Schr\u00f6der - doing as much for the corpse of Monnet?</p> <p>Now we approach the fateful year 999. Otto is 19. He is obsessed with Italy. With Rome. With empire. In that year, he sees to it that Gerbert is elected pope, taking the name Sylvester. Now emperor and pope move south to the decaying small town of Rome, where Otto builds himself a palace on the Aventine, a bad luck hill, as Cicero could have testified.</p> <p>Together, Otto and Sylvester lavished their love and their ambition upon the Romans, who hated both of them with a passion. In the year that our millennium properly began, 1001, the Romans drove emperor and pope out of the city. Otto died at 22, near Viterbo, of smallpox. A year later, Sylvester was dead, having first, it is said, invented the organ. Thus, the dream of a European union ended in disaster for the two dreamers.</p> <p>I will not go so far as to say that the 1,000 years since Otto's death have been a total waste of time. Certainly, other dreamers have had similar centripetal dreams. But those centrifugal forces that hold us in permanent thrall invariably undo the various confederacies, leagues, empires, 1,000-year reichs that the centripetalists would impose upon us from the top down.</p> <p>Recently, the literary critic Harold Bloom, in the somewhat quixotic course of trying to establish a Western literary canon, divided human history into phases that cyclically repeat. First, he says, there is a theocratic age, next an aristocratic age, followed by a democratic age, which degenerates into chaos, out of which some new idea of divinity will emerge to unite us all in a new theocratic age, and the cycle begins again.</p> <p>Bloom rather dreads the coming theocratic age, but since he - and I - will never see it, we can settle comfortably into the current chaos where the meaning of meaning is an endlessly cozy subject and Heisenberg's principle is the undisputed law of the land, at least from where each of us is situated.</p> <p>As we ponder the adventures of Otto and Sylvester, we must note the cyclic nature of the way human society evolves as originally posited by Plato in the eighth book of the Republic and further developed by Giovanni Battista Vico in his Scienza Nuova. Professor Bloom goes straight to Vico, an early-eighteenth-century Neapolitan scholar who became interested in the origins of Roman law.</p> <p>The deeper Vico got into the subject, the further back in time he was obliged to go, specifically, to Greece. Then he got interested in how the human race was able to create an image of itself for itself. At the beginning, there appears to have been an animistic belief in the magic of places and in the personification of the elements as gods. To Vico, these legends, rooted in prehistory, were innate wisdom. But then the age of the gods was challenged by the rise of individual men. Suddenly, kings and heroes are on the scene. They give birth to oligarchies, to an aristocratic society where patricians battle for first place in the state.</p> <p>In time, the always exciting game of who will be king of the castle creates a tyranny that will inspire the people at large to rebel against the tyrants and establish republics that, thanks to man's nature, tend to imperial acquisitiveness. In due course, these empire-republics meet their natural terminus in, let us say, the jungles of Vietnam.</p> <p>What happens next? Vico calls the next stage Chaos, to be followed by a new theocratic age. This process is, of course, pure Hinduism, which was never to stop leaking into Greek thought from Pythagoras to the Neo-Platonists and even now into the collective consciousness of California surfers and ceramicists as well as disciples of the good Allen Ginsberg. Birth, death, chaos, then rebirth and so on and on and on.</p> <p>But though Vico's mind was brilliant and intuitive, the history that he had to deal with necessarily left out science as we know it and he did not. Now we must ponder how chaos may yet organise itself through technology as the means of ultimate control over everyone, even as it seems, currently, to serve China's lively millions as a step toward liberation. Chaos - our current condition - may prove to be too interesting to make order of.</p> <p>Will the next god be a computer? In which case, a tyrant god for those of us who dwell in computer-challenged darkness. A characteristic of our present chaos is the dramatic migration of tribes. They are on the move from East to West, from South to North. Liberal tradition requires that borders must always be open for those in search of safety or even the pursuit of happiness. In the case of the United States, the acquisition of new citizens from all the tribes of Earth has always been thought to be a very good thing. But with so many billions of people on the move, even the great-hearted may well become edgy once we have gobbled up all the computer-proficient immigrants.</p> <p>As we start the third millennium of what we in our Western section of the globe are amused to call the Christian era, we should be aware that most of the world's tribes are, happily for them, not Christian at all. Also, most of us who are classified as Christians and live in nations where this form of monotheism was once all-powerful now live in a secular world.</p> <p>So chaos does have its pleasures. But then as Christian presuppositions do not mean anything to others (as Buddhists reminded the current pope when on holiday in Sri Lanka), so, too, finally, Plato and his perennially interesting worldview don't make much sense when applied to societies such as ours.

For the centripetally minded - theocratic or imperial or both - the mosaic of different tribes that will occupy Europe, let us say, from homely Bantry to glittering Vladivostok, are eventually bound to come together in the interest of mundane trade.

Instead, we were going to make this the greatest weekend of all time \u0085</p> <p><b>Thursday </b> <br>3pm We are ready. We have consulted all the lists of the best things of the millennium and made the ultimate selection. We've rented the best film: Citizen Kane. 'Stairway To Heaven' is in the glove box. We've bought the best invention: a zip. It's all going swimmingly. Anglesey here we come! <br>11.32pm We arrive at our cottage and unpack the Fiat. Peter drops Hamlet in a puddle, then puts Only Fools and Horses in the VCR: the episode containing the greatest TV moment of the past 1,000 years. Peter goes to sleep on the sofa with a knife under his pillow. After all, this is Wales and you can't take chances.</p> <p><b>Friday </b> <br>9.04am The Sanyo booms. 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085' Peter sits bolt upright and hurls a knife at the wall. We nod in appreciation of the best song of the millennium, and fill a pot with its greatest food: beans. From here on, everything we do, eat, read or see has been voted the very best of the millennium. Peter reads from If while Charlie dishes up the Heinz. Charlie salutes the greatest breakfast of the millennium with a swig of Coke and a toke on a Lambert and Butler. <br>9.55am Kane time! We close the curtains, and switch on the greatest movie of all time. Orson Welles, newspapers: it's got it all. The credits roll\u0085 Fuck, it's in black and white! We hit eject and slap in Fools and Horses. Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! <br>12.15pm Time for millennium roleplay. We draw names from a bowler hat. Charlie gets Muhammad Ali, strips down to his boxers and thumps Peter on the arm. Peter was hoping for Ali G, but gets Galileo. In tribute to the great Italian astronomer, Peter heads upstairs with a pair of binoculars and trains them on the cottage across the marsh. He's in need of company, and the figures moving in the upstairs window look like girls. <br>2.30pm Peter turns on the three-bar fire and we settle down on the sofa with Hamlet: the greatest literary achievement of the millennium. We're so engrossed in this masterpiece that we lose all track of time. <br>2.37pm Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! <br>4.45pm Charlie spends some time contemplating the best picture of the millennium. It's an extraordinary portrait: the enigmatic smile, the eyes which seem to follow you around the room. Mystery surrounds the identity of the model. Chances are Athena found him in a gay bar and paid him a tenner to cradle the baby with his top off. <br>11.57pm To avoid having to use the phrase 'Happy Y2K', Charlie goes to bed with Dickens. Peter raises a glass of Coca-Cola to the contraceptive pill, and washes down a month's supply. He's asleep and dribbling before the countdown begins.</p> <p><b>Saturday</b> <br>9.40am A new era. Charlie comes downstairs to find Peter in the kitchen, hunched over a saucepan, ragging down his breasts with warm milk. 'They've swollen,' sobs Peter. 'Don't worry,' says Charlie, 'we packed a Wonderbra.' <br>2.55pm Peter is on the sofa, playing with a zip. He seems content. 'This revolutionised the button.' Charlie nods then somersaults across the lounge, into some golf clubs. 'No time for that now - we've got a moon landing to recreate.' <br>3.20pm 'Moon to Earth,' calls Charlie from the garden, recreating the greatest achievement of mankind, 'can you hear me loud and clear?' Peter can't. He's caught his nipple in the zip, and the pain has made him deaf. Charlie leaps from the wheelbarrow, plants a flag, wees into the air and takes a soil sample. 'Holyhead, we have a problem.' <br>10.16pm Newport Pagnell service station. We fill the Fiat and split the first Ginsters of the new millennium. We rejoin the M1 and head south. There's no question: this has been the best weekend of all time. Peter turns up the stereo. We hear a familiar tune. 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085 ' We clip the central reservation and ping across the lanes into some scrub. We sob. A trembling hand reaches across and cups Peter's breast. Somehow it makes us both feel better.</p>",

'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085' Peter sits bolt upright and hurls a knife at the wall. We nod in appreciation of the best song of the millennium, and fill a pot with its greatest food: beans. From here on, everything we do, eat, read or see has been voted the very best of the millennium. Peter reads from If while Charlie dishes up the Heinz. Charlie salutes the greatest breakfast of the millennium with a swig of Coke and a toke on a Lambert and Butler. 9.55am Kane time! We close the curtains, and switch on the greatest movie of all time. Orson Welles, newspapers: it's got it all. The credits roll\u0085 Fuck, it's in black and white! We hit eject and slap in Fools and Horses. Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! 12.15pm Time for millennium roleplay. We draw names from a bowler hat. Charlie gets Muhammad Ali, strips down to his boxers and thumps Peter on the arm. Peter was hoping for Ali G, but gets Galileo. In tribute to the great Italian astronomer, Peter heads upstairs with a pair of binoculars and trains them on the cottage across the marsh. He's in need of company, and the figures moving in the upstairs window look like girls. 2.30pm Peter turns on the three-bar fire and we settle down on the sofa with Hamlet: the greatest literary achievement of the millennium. We're so engrossed in this masterpiece that we lose all track of time. 2.37pm Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! 4.45pm Charlie spends some time contemplating the best picture of the millennium. It's an extraordinary portrait: the enigmatic smile, the eyes which seem to follow you around the room. Mystery surrounds the identity of the model. Chances are Athena found him in a gay bar and paid him a tenner to cradle the baby with his top off. 11.57pm To avoid having to use the phrase 'Happy Y2K', Charlie goes to bed with Dickens. Peter raises a glass of Coca-Cola to the contraceptive pill, and washes down a month's supply. He's asleep and dribbling before the countdown begins. Saturday 9.40am A new era. Charlie comes downstairs to find Peter in the kitchen, hunched over a saucepan, ragging down his breasts with warm milk. 'They've swollen,' sobs Peter. 'Don't worry,' says Charlie, 'we packed a Wonderbra.' 2.55pm Peter is on the sofa, playing with a zip. He seems content. 'This revolutionised the button.' Charlie nods then somersaults across the lounge, into some golf clubs. 'No time for that now - we've got a moon landing to recreate.' 3.20pm 'Moon to Earth,' calls Charlie from the garden, recreating the greatest achievement of mankind, 'can you hear me loud and clear?' Peter can't. He's caught his nipple in the zip, and the pain has made him deaf. Charlie leaps from the wheelbarrow, plants a flag, wees into the air and takes a soil sample. 'Holyhead, we have a problem.' 10.16pm Newport Pagnell service station. We fill the Fiat and split the first Ginsters of the new millennium. We rejoin the M1 and head south. There's no question: this has been the best weekend of all time. Peter turns up the stereo. We hear a familiar tune. 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085 ' We clip the central reservation and ping across the lanes into some scrub. We sob. A trembling hand reaches across and cups Peter's breast. Somehow it makes us both feel better.",

But at least one British bible scholar, Ormond Edwards, believes the celebrations in Bethlehem's Manger Square yesterday, which made up in fierce joy what they lacked in numbers or multi-million pound pyro-technics, were, after all, the right rites at the right time. In his new book, Dating the Millennium, the product of years poring over the differences between the gospels of Luke and Matthew and trying to fix the crucial date of King Herod's death, he concludes that Jesus was, after all, born in 1BC. It was debatable how much accuracy mattered to the tens of thousands of Christians - pilgrims, tourists, priests and members of the ancient Palestinian Christian community - who thronged the little Manger Square, its millennium makeover not quite finished, to cheer in the new year. Even Muslims, for whom Friday was the last day of Ramadan, a great holiday, were drawn into the festivities. 'The Christians and Muslims have been here in Bethlehem for centuries and centuries. We're brothers. There's no difference between us,' said Fathi Kanan, a bank worker sitting in the shade on the edge of the square yesterday, watching a stream of tourists coming and going from the Church of the Nativity, said to be built over the spot where Jesus was born. 'It was great fun. Fantastic. Everyone was dancing and laughing. I was dancing, and so was all my family.' For Bethlehem, now under the control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, the millennium celebrations were, its people hope, a prelude to the even bigger party due to follow later this year when an independent Palestine emerges. The Palestinian national flag hung from lampposts on the road leading into Bethlehem, alongside symbols and coloured lights with a religious theme. The traffic lights weren't working yesterday morning, but it wasn't because of the phantom menace of the millennium bug: they hadn't worked before, either. The Palestinians have a lot of work to do, and hoped the media attention on the New Year's Eve Bethlehem party would encourage the donors to keep on giving. Arafat himself saw in the new year in Gaza City, confirming to the largest rally since his return from exile in 1994 that Palestine would be independent this year. Elsewhere, the Israelis' massive security operation at sensitive sites such as Temple Mount, in the Old City, the Mount of Olives - where the Second Coming of Christ is supposed to occur - and Megiddo, the Biblical Armageddon, paid off. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims came and went from the renowned Al-Aqsa mosque for Ramadan prayers on New Year's Eve without a single incident. For Israel's Jewish majority, it was the Sabbath, which runs from dusk on Friday to dusk on Saturday. In religiously observant Jewish west Jerusalem, bars and restaurants were eerily shuttered and dark, and hotels were forbidden to have parties with music or freshly cooked food on pain of losing their kosher certificates. But in hedonistic Tel Aviv, the Big Orange as the Israelis like to call it, secular Jews joined in the party. Standing eating a stuffed pitta bread at an outdoor millennium party close to the Mount of Olives, Father Maroun Lahham, rector of a Catholic seminary in Jerusalem, said this year might be 1420 for Muslims and 5760 for Jews, but in reality, they used the Western calendar. 'Today, when the Chief Rabbi writes his first letter, he'll date it 1 January 2000, and the Great Mufti of Jerusalem will date his 1 January 2000. So practically everybody is starting a new millennium. But for that very reason, it does have pretty much a purely social meaning.' The feared outrages or mass suicides by exalted Christians seduced by Jerusalem's atmosphere and history into making a new Bible story, with themselves as leading players, did not materialise. On the Mount of Olives, thick with Israeli police officers, an American man was jumped on and led away when he proclaimed himself at midnight to be God's messenger, and two British pilgrims were detained near the Golden Gate - where the returned Messiah will supposedly enter Jerusalem - when they began behaving erratically. One started to fulminate about how bar codes on people's shopping were the mark of the beast. A prayer vigil was held in the Basilica of Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives, where according to the Bible Jesus waited to be betrayed by Judas. Afterwards, thousands of Christians, led by a police van and flanked by heavily armed Israeli troops, formed a ragged column and marched, carrying candles and a large wooden cross, to the garden of a Christian guesthouse for a millennium party. Franciscan friars in rough brown habits sang in Latin as the cross swung through the warm night, smelling of dust and leaves. In the garden, the cross was set erect, hymns were sung, and there was a countdown to midnight. Stuffing himself with his falafel-filled pitta, Father Maroun seemed quite relieved that Jesus had not, as a few fervent Christians hoped, decided to join the party. 'Now we are in the year 2000 and nothing has happened. I really hope everybody will be reasonable,' he said, looking into the dark groves around him, where light glinted off the eyes and time-worn gun barrels of watchful Israeli soldiers. 'I believe He will come again, and I believe nobody knows the hour. It could be now. It could be in a million years. I don't see any link between 2000 and Jesus Christ.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Things looked really bad at 11.30. The 150 middle-aged Italians and French who had jetted in on a last-minute package tour were as glum as leftover Christmas puddings. Here they were at the end of the mapped universe with a Malian dressed like a Kosovan refugee singing in a language they did not understand about a country of which they knew nothing with musicians who smoked continuously and sat on the floor... Twenty minutes later, the band were looking desperate. 'Are you 'appeee?' shouted one of the backing singers. The audience remained as impassive as judges at a British horse show. The singer tried again. 'Are you appee? Etes-vous contents?' The 60 or so Malians who by now had infiltrated the room were swaying, but the great rump of middle Euroland was still not impressed. It was all too much for one elderly French couple who got up and left, saying they thought the music was too loud. Then a girl in a red dress began to dance with the band. The Malians began to bop. Others, emboldened, started to shout at the Euroblobs to get up or get out. They finally got the message and most filtered into the night. In a few minutes the room had been taken over by the Malians and the new year was greeted with an ecstasy of arm-wavings, tears of joy and Bonnes Ann\u00e9es. Mali, as always, had retained its dignity, but it was a close shave. The band leader was Ali Farka Tour\u00e9, Mali's most celebrated musician, a man who packs giant dance halls in the US, France and Britain. 'I have come back to my land for the year 2000. Once I went to the people around the world. Now they can come and see me.' Tour\u00e9 was everywhere on Friday night; in the desert playing to a crowd as the sun set, in the hotels, and then at dawn back in the desert, ripped but still fervently hoping the millennium would turn round the fortunes of his country. How many people will trek to Timbuktu to see him or the narrow sandy streets of the city built 1,000 years ago, which reached its apogee as a centre of world learning and religion before the British empire was even conceived, remains unclear. Poor Mali. Poor Timbuktu. So far from anywhere, so beautiful, but so unappreciated. Last year fewer than 50,000 tourists came, and the landlocked country remains one of the three poorest in the world. Most people earn less than a dollar a day. The mayor, who likes to personally stamp the passports of every visitor, had given up and closed shop. The three hotel keepers were booked out, tents were being set up in the desert outside town, a new hotel had opened in record time and people were throwing open their doors to the estimated 350 foreigners in town. 'Tourism may be the only way to survive,' said Jiddou ag Almoustapha, president of the the town's Tuareg association. Many of these nomads still refuse to settle or to do manual work, but hiring out camels, selling cheap knives and singing for tourists is one of the few options they now have for survival. They recognise that there is good money to be mined from the whites just as salt has for centuries been mined from the desert. For the vast majority of Timbuktu's citizens, millennium night was as any other, with no clocks sounding, bells or fireworks at midnight. The streets were quiet and black. This is Ramadan and the pressure from mosques and Koranic schools to be indoors with the family has been great.</p>",

Twenty minutes later, the band were looking desperate. 'Are you 'appeee?' shouted one of the backing singers. The audience remained as impassive as judges at a British horse show. The singer tried again. 'Are you appee? Etes-vous contents?' The 60 or so Malians who by now had infiltrated the room were swaying, but the great rump of middle Euroland was still not impressed. It was all too much for one elderly French couple who got up and left, saying they thought the music was too loud. Then a girl in a red dress began to dance with the band. The Malians began to bop. Others, emboldened, started to shout at the Euroblobs to get up or get out. They finally got the message and most filtered into the night. In a few minutes the room had been taken over by the Malians and the new year was greeted with an ecstasy of arm-wavings, tears of joy and Bonnes Ann\u00e9es. Mali, as always, had retained its dignity, but it was a close shave. The band leader was Ali Farka Tour\u00e9, Mali's most celebrated musician, a man who packs giant dance halls in the US, France and Britain. 'I have come back to my land for the year 2000. Once I went to the people around the world. Now they can come and see me.' Tour\u00e9 was everywhere on Friday night; in the desert playing to a crowd as the sun set, in the hotels, and then at dawn back in the desert, ripped but still fervently hoping the millennium would turn round the fortunes of his country. How many people will trek to Timbuktu to see him or the narrow sandy streets of the city built 1,000 years ago, which reached its apogee as a centre of world learning and religion before the British empire was even conceived, remains unclear. Poor Mali. Poor Timbuktu. So far from anywhere, so beautiful, but so unappreciated. Last year fewer than 50,000 tourists came, and the landlocked country remains one of the three poorest in the world. Most people earn less than a dollar a day. The mayor, who likes to personally stamp the passports of every visitor, had given up and closed shop. The three hotel keepers were booked out, tents were being set up in the desert outside town, a new hotel had opened in record time and people were throwing open their doors to the estimated 350 foreigners in town. 'Tourism may be the only way to survive,' said Jiddou ag Almoustapha, president of the the town's Tuareg association. Many of these nomads still refuse to settle or to do manual work, but hiring out camels, selling cheap knives and singing for tourists is one of the few options they now have for survival. They recognise that there is good money to be mined from the whites just as salt has for centuries been mined from the desert. For the vast majority of Timbuktu's citizens, millennium night was as any other, with no clocks sounding, bells or fireworks at midnight. The streets were quiet and black. This is Ramadan and the pressure from mosques and Koranic schools to be indoors with the family has been great.",

'This is still the most beautiful city in the world,' said Jane Miller from Tucson, Arizona. 'Where else would I be on such a night? And what's more, you can overeat to your heart's content.' Food was, inevitably, at the centre of the capital's celebrations.

Lobster in salted butter was followed by turbot in caviar and watercress. The hub of the feast was lamb, served with truffle flakes in a delicate pastry crust.

At the Lido, the famous high-kicking cabaret on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, a full house in evening dresses and dinner jackets had forked out \u00a3550 each for the floorshow and a six-course menu. Guest of honour was a 92-year-old grandmother who had blown most of her savings on inviting 16 members of her family. Outside, security was tight as the police feared revellers might turn nasty in the crush, as some did after France's World Cup victory. The entire city force of 10,000 was on duty and in evidence, as well as 40 units of riot police and roving officers drafted in from other regions. A hundred supervisors gathered in an underground bunker to watch tapes from 350 video surveillance cameras around the city. In the event, the atmosphere on the Champs was joyous, not threatening. 'Bonne ann\u00e9e, bonne ann\u00e9e,' was the cry. The Interior Ministry reported just 40 arrests for minor offences and some 230 slight injuries. Outside the capital, villages across France deprived of electricity did their best with salmon, cold cuts and candles. 'It's a bit dismal, but at least everyone's alive,' said Maryvonne Sauveur from Surg\u00e8res in Charente-Maritime, the d\u00e9partement that suffered most from last week's vicious storms.

      "body": "<p>Just for a moment, it was possible to believe.</p> <p>With all the best parties there comes that one sublime moment, stranded in time, when all things seem possible. When our human frailty and the infinite sadnesses it engenders can be set aside for a few seconds. When all that counts is, simply, that we will remember, with a happy little shock, that we are alive. Before the comedown, before the hangover. When the simple fact that we can breathe, and think, on a blue planet warmed by one of the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way seems the most joyous accident of all eternity. And so it was with the biggest party on the planet, when most of its 600 billion souls stopped, if for one second, to remember that they were alive together, on Earth, the beautiful accident.</p> <p>The hangover has come, as it always does. Already, we have started to kill each other again. Yesterday's dawn brought neither Armageddon nor Paradise. We ate. It rained. Boring things happened, and pompous things happened. The Chinese tried to boast that 'their' millennium had been more significant than any other, coming at the end of 5,000, not 2,000, years of history. London tried to congratulate itself on having hosted the finest party on the globe, when in fact what it had hosted was one expensive, vaguely pleasant, aimless, passion-free crush.</p> <p>But there had been a moment - a minute, five minutes, an hour - when, while celebrating and watching the rest of our planet celebrate, the togetherness was there, and, as we moved together into 1.1.00, there was hope. In this new beginning was the word, but the word was no longer God. It was peace.</p> <p>Peace, on the lips and banners of the millions lining Tiananmen Square; and despite the history, we could, for a moment, believe. Peace, from the tens of thousands at Bombay's Gateway of India monument, as exhausted hostages returned to their families; and we could believe. Peace, from the lips of Moscow, as Grozny further collapsed under a new barrage, and we tried to believe. Peace from America, the land where hundreds spent the night holed up in survivalist boltholes in fear of a UN 'invasion', but still the land where they are outnumbered by the clever and the sane, a million of whom gathered in Times Square; and we could believe.</p> <p>What could we believe? We could believe that, for one moment, all of them at least meant it. And for this, we have to thank television. This is why it was a party like no other; for it was the first time the world could watch itself, as dawn raced across it at 740 miles an hour, and remember how alone on this rock we all are; how dependent on each other for love, or life, or unity, or death; and for a moment we took joy from watching others' celebrations.</p> <p>The technology that gave us TV is, of course, a double-edged sword: its culture both unites and divides us. This was a filmic party, designed for the lens.

      "bodyText": "Just for a moment, it was possible to believe. With all the best parties there comes that one sublime moment, stranded in time, when all things seem possible. When our human frailty and the infinite sadnesses it engenders can be set aside for a few seconds. When all that counts is, simply, that we will remember, with a happy little shock, that we are alive. Before the comedown, before the hangover. When the simple fact that we can breathe, and think, on a blue planet warmed by one of the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way seems the most joyous accident of all eternity. And so it was with the biggest party on the planet, when most of its 600 billion souls stopped, if for one second, to remember that they were alive together, on Earth, the beautiful accident. The hangover has come, as it always does. Already, we have started to kill each other again. Yesterday's dawn brought neither Armageddon nor Paradise. We ate. It rained. Boring things happened, and pompous things happened. The Chinese tried to boast that 'their' millennium had been more significant than any other, coming at the end of 5,000, not 2,000, years of history. London tried to congratulate itself on having hosted the finest party on the globe, when in fact what it had hosted was one expensive, vaguely pleasant, aimless, passion-free crush. But there had been a moment - a minute, five minutes, an hour - when, while celebrating and watching the rest of our planet celebrate, the togetherness was there, and, as we moved together into 1.1.00, there was hope. In this new beginning was the word, but the word was no longer God. It was peace. Peace, on the lips and banners of the millions lining Tiananmen Square; and despite the history, we could, for a moment, believe. Peace, from the tens of thousands at Bombay's Gateway of India monument, as exhausted hostages returned to their families; and we could believe. Peace, from the lips of Moscow, as Grozny further collapsed under a new barrage, and we tried to believe. Peace from America, the land where hundreds spent the night holed up in survivalist boltholes in fear of a UN 'invasion', but still the land where they are outnumbered by the clever and the sane, a million of whom gathered in Times Square; and we could believe. What could we believe? We could believe that, for one moment, all of them at least meant it. And for this, we have to thank television. This is why it was a party like no other; for it was the first time the world could watch itself, as dawn raced across it at 740 miles an hour, and remember how alone on this rock we all are; how dependent on each other for love, or life, or unity, or death; and for a moment we took joy from watching others' celebrations. The technology that gave us TV is, of course, a double-edged sword: its culture both unites and divides us. This was a filmic party, designed for the lens. Thus, while we had that undeniable frisson of shared joy from the other side of the world, it was joy for a people, for a mass of humanity; the individual was mostly forgotten. Thus we had the Moriori natives dancing for eight hours for us on Millennium Island as that first dawn approached. And, as an image, it worked perfectly, and united us with a sense of wonder; but we thought little of the people there; of the fact the race has been invaded and slaughtered with unceasing routine down the centuries; of the women having to strap themselves, for the benefit of Western sensibilities, into what looked like canvas bras from the time of the Naafi demob, of the dozens of camera crews perched, smoking, higher up the beach.

Aircraft stayed in the skies, water, electricity and gas supplies were not disrupted. From Moldova to Mauritius, the bug was a conspicuous no-show. Apart from a small glitch in nuclear monitoring systems in Japan, some 'minor problems' for French manufacturers, temporary delays in Gambia's tax offices and a handful of non-functioning video recorders, 'war rooms' around the globe enjoyed a mercifully peaceful new year. But Government and industry specialists are warning that when business resumes on Tuesday, new glitches could emerge. In Whitehall's 'blue room', all remained 'boringly quiet', according to one jaded official. Poor Peter Snow, on the BBC's Bug Watch, stood forlornly in front of a back-projected giant cockroach with absolutely nothing to report. Across the globe, the story was the same. By the small hours of yesterday morning, the worldwide Y2K nerve centre in Washington had given the all-clear in more than half of the 170 countries it monitors. In a sea of green lights, only Gambia's 'Government Services' failed a clean bill of health with a problem relating to its tax office which was, apparently, 'not entirely due to Y2K problems'. The Foreign Office was taking hourly updates from 76 embassies around the world, starting with Tonga, farthest east, and ending with the Solomon Islands, the last place to see in the millennium. Foreign Office Minister John Battle said: 'All these initial reports, one hour after the event, showed no major Y2K related problems.' He claimed that Britain had played an international role in averting the bug, through the 58 international seminars with computer scientists organised by the British Council, and the Government's website which gave details of every country's progress in combating the threat. 'We have been seen to be a leader. Other countries are coming to us to say: \"Can you give us advice?\"' Cabinet Office Minister Paddy Tipping dismissed the failure of a tide gauge in Portsmouth harbour and a PC in a weather station in Aberdeen as 'too trivial to mention'. The Government spent \u00a3420m ensuring its own systems were bug free. Half the critical systems are in the Armed Forces. Tipping said: 'Getting senior generals and people high up in the military to take computer issues seriously has been very, very difficult indeed. They had their own problems. They had wars to fight.' He added: 'Some of the worst fears were either designed out or over-hyped. It is still early days and there could be some embedded chips which could cause a problem working their way through the system.' The worst problems may emerge when small businesses reopen on Tuesday. So has the world been caught by a massive Y2K bug con? A job creation scheme for computer consultants, some of whom were on millennium stand-by for as much as \u00a310,000 a day. 'Not at all,' said a Government spokesman yesterday. 'Our banks have spent \u00a31 billion, utilities have spent \u00a3170m and telecoms have spent \u00a3500m on millennium compliance. This was necessary expenditure, not money wasted. The Government did its job in raising the profile of the problem and getting the key industries to clear the hurdle.' According to American technology consultancy the Gartner Group, worldwide governments have spent up to \u00a3375bn worldwide on updating old technology to cope with Y2K. Gartner analyst Andy Kyte had some words of comfort for disappointed doom-mongers: 'Who could have predicted so few problems? But closer analysis will show that so many businesses had shut down for two or three days that really the world's computer systems had been deactivated and will be reactivated in the year 2000 and we still have to wait and see whether under full load, doing all of their transactions, they can cope with normal business.' The advice to all banks and other businesses this weekend was that the as yet untroubled 'war rooms' should not disband but continue monitoring the situation into the week ahead.</p>",

He is known to share Major's anger at the way both former Prime Ministers were airbrushed out of party history during its autumn conference, when Margaret Thatcher was given great prominence and allowed to promote her campaign to free the former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet. Speaking from his Salisbury home, and sounding cheerful, Heath said: 'Those boys have been going into it with such enthusiasm that it would look like an organised crime if I joined in.' But he added: 'For some people to go on saying there has been no movement of the party to the right is absolute nonsense.' Publicly, Hague responded to Major's attack by denying that he had taken the party to the right. In private his aides suggested the former Prime Minister was motivated by pique. One said: 'John Major resents the way his premiership has been criticised. He resents the way he is held responsible for what went wrong. The bad blood between him and Thatcher is obviously quite acute.' Tory MP Julian Lewis, who resigned from his post at Tory Central Office in 1996 in protest at Major's 'weak' leadership, said sarcastically: 'If the party under the leadership of John Major with Ken Clarke holding a gun to his head had led us to stunning victory, I might think their advice worth taking.' The Observer has learnt that Major wrote his broadside a fortnight ago, at about the time Witney MP Shaun Woodward announced his defection to Labour. David Curry, who resigned from the Shadow Cabinet two years ago in protest at Hague's hard line on Europe, said: 'John told me before Christmas that he had written this piece, so I have been waiting for this Exocet to go off.'",

      "body": "<p>I met a man just before the eve of 2000, a busy and successful actor who had suffered a lot in the last decade. He told me he would spend the millennial evening alone, looking at the stars, thinking, dreaming. He wanted to garner some meaning, as one century ratcheted into another; he wanted to let his mind settle, expand. We used to call this prayer.</p> <p>When religion fades, many rituals fade with it, leaving behind a few husks which we fill with our own meanings. Until very recently, the year was measured out in rituals, hundreds of them to take you step by tiny, certain step from New Year's Day to Christmas Eve. Look at your diary and you may still see the names of religious festivals which for many of us are incomprehensible. What are Palm Sunday and Ember Day, not to mention Septuagesima Sunday and the Golden Number and Rogation Sunday? There were particular prayers for particular events - prayers for rainy days, prayers to ward off the plague, prayers for the sick and the suffering and the negligent and the faithful. The rosary. The bell, book and candle. These were ways of marking out each stage of life, from birth to old age: christening, confirmation, coming of age, marriage. People still marry in church, even when they have no belief, but how many non-believers christen their child now - stand up and speak the centuries-old words that have lost their meaning? Of course, I write of Christianity, having been bought up in a vaguely Christian way (church on Christmas Day and Easter, a few prayers off by heart, a dim knowledge of the Bible, especially the Gospels and the Psalms). Each religion has its own rituals, its calendar and its schedule: candles in the window, stones on the grave, prayers facing east, the fasts and the feasts. Formal incantations, spoken together, making up a community: a chant, a spectacle, a piece of magic which everyone believed in that gave shape to shapeless time and order to the random, often brutal age.</p> <p>Having a life ruled and ordered by rituals is like stepping on the cracks. Pace by pace, you may live your life according to your culture. Now we plummet through the year. Christmas, Easter, school terms and school holidays: giant leaps across sickening furls of racing time. Like many people, I adore and need rituals and yet have no religion, possess few given rites of passage to help me from month to month. I make them up, fanatically dividing time into manageable segments, each solemnised by rituals. Birthdays, anniversaries, the beginning of terms, the beginning of holidays, Sunday suppers: each become something freighted with my desire to make them mean more than they do. I think a lot of us do this, seeking private ways of filling the spaces left behind by faith.</p> <p>How do we think of ourselves now? As individuals, who chose our own lives; as self-inventors; as radically uncertain and subjective; as people who can begin again, any time we want to, as modern and rational beings in an increasingly Godless world; above all, as free, unchained from the patterns of the tyrannical past, unwilling and unable to give up our individuality to any higher power. We are modern, and modernism necessarily endangers rituals, which are about tradition and a kind of conservatism, and about the possibility of losing ourselves, surrendering ourselves to the ritual. (Graham Greene said that even when a corrupt, non-believing Catholic priest held communion, it did not lose its meaning; the individual is irrelevant within the transcendent ceremony.) When belief withers, material objects tend to flood in to the emptied-out symbols that used to house faith.</p> <p>Rituals are created by repetition, but they need belief if they are to keep their resonance - and belief does not necessarily need to imply religion. Many rituals are secular: the wigs and gowns of the court; the ceremonies of Parliament; the military rituals which keep an individual firmly lashed to the rules of the Army. Without our belief, they gradually turn into something else - a spectacle, a charade, a piece of theatre, a custom. They may remain outwardly the same, but their meaning changes; what was once an assertion of faith becomes an expression of nostalgia and longing, or of conformity. They may still be powerful, but they no longer have the same function, which is to connect the individual with community; the present moment with the past; the living with the dead; the faithful with the officiating; the earthly with the transcendent.</p> <p>In many instances, the public and coherent meaning of rituals have become a set of fragmented, private traditions. It is too easy to say that Christmas has lost its meaning and moan about consumerism and the facile materialism of modern life. It's rather that the collective has dissolved into separate, individual ones. Those family customs acquire potent significance over the years - what goes on top of the tree, what time you open your presents, whether you play Monopoly or charades; the whole hidden history of a family that gets played out each year.</p> <p>It's similar to when people marry in church, even if they no longer believe in God. It is not just because they want to dress in white and be a bride and never mind the religious bits; for this one moment, they want to experience the solemnity that a church and a church wed ding offers. Churches, as Philip Larkin said, are places to be serious in, places where you go with your freight of pain and your misdeeds and are absolved. And in a church, even when God is absent, you are surrounded by all the dead, with their ancient thoughts and their urgent prayers. Old and new merge. I am an atheist who married in a register office, but I can sympathise with those who don't want the clerkish atmosphere of the civic ceremony, the threadbare, legalistic words. The most unbelieving heart throbs to the words of the church wedding, or to the words of the Book of Common Prayer.</p> <p>I have the book beside me now, beautifully reissued by Everyman. Reading it, I understand that until our modern age it wasn't really a book at all, not in the sense we understand it. It was a ceremony, liturgical and ritualistic. In the introduction, it is described as a 'piece of theatre, designed to be performed by an entire people, week by week, day by day _ a drama of human life and destiny where all those present have a speaking part' - 'Lift up your hearts'; 'We lift them up unto the Lord.'</p> <p>The rites inscribed in its pages mark the stages of human life, from birth to death. Baptism, confirmation, marriage, childbirth, sickness, sorrow and death. It is a treasure-house of English literature and a book of myths. Now most of us, if we read it at all, read it privately, alone, in our heads. We are estranged from its old meaning and have nothing to replace it.</p> <p>Rituals - rites of passage - take you from one state to another. The birth, the christening or its cultural equivalent, the coming of age, the wedding, the death, the funeral. They are vital in a community. They offer us continuity and coherence; they give us meaning. They offer us the chance to look at ourselves, examine what we have become and where we want to go. So, in the absence of plausible rituals, we make up our own. Do-it-yourself marriages, in a place which has particular meaning for you (underwater, on a hill, soon on the London Eye ...), with words you chose for yourself. Naming ceremonies in place of christenings, because we want to welcome solemnly the new child but we don't want to promise to bring them up as strict Christians or whatever. I once went to a naming ceremony in the wilds of the Peak District. It was raining and the wind took away the words, and the grandmother, in her brimmed church-hat, looked distressed and embarrassed.</p> <p>We have secular funerals, which Jonathan Miller once described as 'scraps and anthologies of poems and bits of music that he or she might have liked, and they sound like benefits for a theatrical charity _ a scrappy, suburban business'. Yet we still need to find a way to say goodbye and to start the process of healing. Even the act of dying used to be ritualised. Kings would do it in public, surrounded by their courtiers who were there to witness their crossing of the threshold. Their last words would be prepared in advance, rehearsed. Now, most people die alone, in a hospital room, unwitnessed. And how could you have a ritual for it, anyhow, when there is, for most of us, no sense of transition, just an ending, a miserable full stop where we had wanted the sentence to continue?</p> <p>And private rituals tend to get a bad name, become strange rumours - Satanic rituals, Masonic rituals. Yet we want them, we want our secular myths, for there is always a tension between our modern, fresh, liberated selves and our yearning for the old and for continuity with our past. There's something dreary about momentous events that are not publicly and ritualistically marked, divorce, for instance, which you get in the post, like a reminder to pay your TV licence or collect from the court as if you are buying a second-class stamp. It's a furtive and ignominious business, and entirely bureau cratic, nothing to do with all that clashing pain. How do you invent a ritual for failure? But I'm sure we will, just as May Day or Hallowe'en were invented. We tend to think of rituals as good, ennobling, lifting us momentarily outside ourselves. They can be repressive and brutal and farcical too; conservative and perverse, tying us into a past from which we want to escape. Fox-hunting is a ritual.</p> <p>The monarchy is rich in ritual and degraded of meaning - all the ermine and the jewels, the carriages and the absurd, fetishistic ceremonies that symbolise a power they no longer have. Rituals can be a way of hanging on to a past which we have outgrown: the hanging-out of the sheet on the wedding night, to see the drops of virgin blood. As Eric Hobsbawm points out in The Invention of Tradition , a society will most cling to rituals as it is changing. The last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth were cluttered with invented rituals, as the old world and its values slid away.</p> <p>It's a paradoxical task - to hold on to the past and to move into the future; to be tied by the bonds which you sever. And here we stand, in the first days of 2000, looking backwards, looking forwards, looking for meaning.</p>",

It was taken from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford at 1.30am yesterday and represents the first big heist of 2000. Police said the thieves appeared to have broken in through the main gallery's glass roof as thousands of revellers were celebrating on the city's streets.</p> <p>The thieves seem to have gained access from the adjoining Oxford University Library, which is undergoing building work, before clambering over rooftops to reach the museum itself. Forensic officers were yesterday searching the area for clues.</p> <p>At a conference at the museum yesterday, Superintendent John Carr of Oxford Police, who is leading the hunt for the thieves, said he believed the painting had been stolen to order. 'Whoever has taken this painting has given it some thought in relation to the manner the painting has been stolen.

The Ashmolean is home to one of Britain's finest art collections, which includes works by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, Van Gogh and Michelangelo. It also features a lantern that belonged to a justice of the peace present at the arrest of Guy Fawkes.</p> <p>It is not the first time the Ashmolean, the world's oldest public museum, has been targeted by thieves. In 1997 a gang tried to steal a 1,100-year-old jewel made for Alfred the Great, gaining entry via scaffolding put up during a \u00a33m refurbishment. The three-strong gang attacked the glass encasing the centrepiece without success and set off the alarm system.</p> <p>The previous year, two seventeenth-century bottles made in France were stolen from the museum. In 1992 security measures were stepped up after Greek vases, paintings, silverware and a sixteenth-century painting were stolen by a visitor under his coat and a collection of jewellery worth \u00a350,000 was taken.</p> <p>However, former Detective Inspector Charles Hill - the man behind the 1994 recovery of Munch's The Scream - last week dismissed the idea that art theft was still a gentleman's crime. In fact, increasingly often it is carried out by gangs with links to drugs and arms dealing. The Sicilian Mafia have for years used the art market to launder millions of pounds of drug money. Items are smuggled out of the country and sold on the black market.</p> <p>Museums are often reluctant to publicise thefts for fear of attracting more problems. As a result most other major European countries have built up their own national art crimes squad. Scotland Yard employs only two detective constables.</p> <p><b>Great art thefts</b></p> <p>At the Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990, robbers dressed as police took seven paintings worth a total of \u00a3130m, including Vermeer's The Concert and Rembrandt's Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It was the biggest art raid of all time.</p> <p>In May 1998 thieves crept barefoot through Rome's National Museum of Modern Art and took two Van Goghs and a Cezanne.</p> <p>In 1994, two robbers escaped with two Turners valued at more than \u00a320 million from Frankfurt's Schirn Gallery. The paintings were on loan from the Tate.</p> <p>In Britain, in January 1995, a man stole a Picasso worth \u00a3650,000 in 35 seconds from the Lefevre Gallery in London's West End and made his getaway in a waiting taxi.</p> <p>In May 1996 a painting attributed to Constable and valued at several million pounds was stolen from the office of the Assistant Commissioner of City of London police.</p> <p>In 1994, Edvard Munch's most famous painting, The Scream, was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo. It was eventually recovered by Scotland Yard.</p> <p>In May 1999, a haul stolen four months earlier from the York City gallery, including a Turner watercolour worth \u00a3500,000, was found in the boot of a car 60 miles away.</p>",

In 1997 a gang tried to steal a 1,100-year-old jewel made for Alfred the Great, gaining entry via scaffolding put up during a \u00a33m refurbishment. The three-strong gang attacked the glass encasing the centrepiece without success and set off the alarm system. The previous year, two seventeenth-century bottles made in France were stolen from the museum. In 1992 security measures were stepped up after Greek vases, paintings, silverware and a sixteenth-century painting were stolen by a visitor under his coat and a collection of jewellery worth \u00a350,000 was taken. However, former Detective Inspector Charles Hill - the man behind the 1994 recovery of Munch's The Scream - last week dismissed the idea that art theft was still a gentleman's crime. In fact, increasingly often it is carried out by gangs with links to drugs and arms dealing. The Sicilian Mafia have for years used the art market to launder millions of pounds of drug money. Items are smuggled out of the country and sold on the black market. Museums are often reluctant to publicise thefts for fear of attracting more problems. As a result most other major European countries have built up their own national art crimes squad. Scotland Yard employs only two detective constables. Great art thefts At the Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990, robbers dressed as police took seven paintings worth a total of \u00a3130m, including Vermeer's The Concert and Rembrandt's Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It was the biggest art raid of all time. In May 1998 thieves crept barefoot through Rome's National Museum of Modern Art and took two Van Goghs and a Cezanne. In 1994, two robbers escaped with two Turners valued at more than \u00a320 million from Frankfurt's Schirn Gallery. The paintings were on loan from the Tate. In Britain, in January 1995, a man stole a Picasso worth \u00a3650,000 in 35 seconds from the Lefevre Gallery in London's West End and made his getaway in a waiting taxi. In May 1996 a painting attributed to Constable and valued at several million pounds was stolen from the office of the Assistant Commissioner of City of London police. In 1994, Edvard Munch's most famous painting, The Scream, was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo. It was eventually recovered by Scotland Yard. In May 1999, a haul stolen four months earlier from the York City gallery, including a Turner watercolour worth \u00a3500,000, was found in the boot of a car 60 miles away.",

The Reverend Prebendary Edward 'Chad' Varah - one of three Companions of Honour in the New Year's Honours List - said it was one of the great disappointments to him that the support network he began in a City of London church almost 50 years ago has abandoned one of its founding principles: to befriend all who called. Volunteers are trained to terminate 'masturbation calls' on the grounds that they are an abuse of the service and 'not appropriate or beneficial to the caller'. But Varah, 88, wants to reinstate a special division, known as the Brendas, which he established in 1958 in response to a question left by volunteers in the log books: 'What to do with obscene calls?' 'I wrote: \"Befriend them, of course\",' said Varah, who divided his volunteers into those prepared to listen to 'pornographic' callers, on the basis that they were not personally the target of the fantasies, and those who were not. That division was abandoned in 1987. Varah now wants it restored - at least in one branch in each of the 14 Samaritan regions across the country. Simon Armson, chief executive of the Samaritans, said: 'We are unable to help some people who may want to maintain contact with us inappropriately when they should be moving on and finding a sustainable relationship in their own life. 'But we are trying to keep in touch with society and we will never shut the door on anything.' The ruling body turned down Varah's proposals to reintroduce the Brenda line three years ago.

      "body": "<p>On a trip back home to New York, I visit my hi-tech eye doctor with a condition dating back almost 30 years: severe short-sightedness and eyes that are tired and scratchy and red from the strain of wearing contact lenses. It's the same old story. Without my contacts, I can't read any of the letters on the eye chart. I can't see that there are actual letters on the eye chart. To tell you the truth, I can't even see that there is an eye chart.</p> <p>For years, we've been discussing laser surgery, and for years Dr C has been saying that it's too experimental, that he doesn't trust the technology. But he's changed his mind. There's a new procedure, with better lasers, and and he's so enthusiastic about it that he's doing five or six operations a week, without any complications (yet). He does some tests which involve sticking various things into my eyes and shining lights into their inner recesses and says that if I want it, I'm ready.</p> <p><b> September 1999</b></p> <p>Do I really want this operation? I've needed glasses since I was seven and, according to family legend, dramatically failed to see the beautiful wild goat silhouetted against the sunset in the distance while on holiday in Greece. 'I can't see him!' I cried (apparently). I've heard about the goat so much that I think of him as a Dr Seuss character: 'I could not see him from the boat/ I could not see that big, huge goat.'</p> <p>It was the start of a long period of bad eyesight and bad eyeglasses: bulbous tortoiseshell ones in the Seventies; bulbous silver ones during the Eighties, and horrible little round ones in later years. I got contact lenses when I was 12 and spent the next 20 years putting them in and taking them out, cleaning them, soaking them and watching them drift away into the netherworld that is the bathroom floor, never to be seen again. I lost the first one in a hurricane on Long Island in 1978. I lost the last one in my house in London in 1999.</p> <p>But I'm used to being nearly blind. (This is how nearly blind I am: my eyesight is roughly 20-2,000, meaning that what a perfectly sighted person can see from 2,000 feet - ie, blobs of grey - I can see from 20 feet.) I'm used to the morning ritual of running my hand across the bedside table to 'look' for my glasses. I'm used to the non-lens-magnified world, a wash of muted colours and bleeding lights.</p> <p>I enjoy long, maudlin reveries about how if I lived in the Dark Ages, I would be one of the blind people in the village, begging for scraps of food by the side of the road as citizens kicked me and laughed at the rags hanging pathetically from my gaunt body. I've always blamed a number of my most glaring problems on poor eyesight, including a fear of heights; an inability to remember what people look like, even ones I met five minutes earlier; and a tendency to drive erratically, sometimes like a little old lady, and sometimes as if there is a fire on the road behind me. What will happen, I wonder, when I lose the ability to not see?</p> <p><b> 25 October</b></p> <p>The doctor has ordered me not to wear contacts or eye make-up for 10 days before the surgery, at a key time when I have to go to a lot of parties, including the Booker Prize. This period of hell, in which I am forced to wear my highly unflattering glasses publicly (latest pair: tiny, little wire frames, like those of a mole) without benefit of cosmetic enhancement, reminds me why I want the surgery so badly.</p> <p><b> 26 October</b></p> <p>I present myself at Dr C's office, pleased with the drugs I have been prescribed: Valium for nerves and Percocet for pain. I took Percocet recreationally in the Eighties! This should be fun. I throw back a Valium, under orders, so that I will be 'compliant' during the surgery. I take my place in the waiting-room of the laser lab, with a number of other patients, all of them men in their thirties who have brought their wives. I have brought my mother.</p> <p>I sit down in the laser room, surrounded by nurses whose job is to grip my hands in order to prevent me from leaping, screaming, from the chair. I am not going to give full details of the surgery - the clamping of the lid, the minute cut to the eye with some sort of implement, the lasering of the inside - because they are not for the squeamish (if you want a grislier description, you can e-mail me, lyall@nytimes.com, but I have to warn you that I do not understand exactly what happened). 'It's such a pleasure to operate on blue eyes!' Dr C says, by way of making me stop whimpering.</p> <p>It only takes a couple of minutes per eye and, weirdly, there's no pain at all. But it's very, very strange and uncomfortable. I have been instructed to stare directly at a blinking red light. 'Whatever you do, DON'T LOOK AWAY,' the doctor repeatedly warns - and all I want to do is look away, just to see what would happen. But I don't. I can't even smell burning eyeball, which some people have warned me about.</p> <p>Afterwards, my eyes feel dry and scratchy and I don't want to open them ever again. But when I do, it's clear that my vision has already dramatically improved. I go home and take a long sleep, fortified by my nice tablets.</p> <p><b> 27 October</b></p> <p>As instructed, I'm putting in eyedrops every hour, three different kinds, and my eyes are so dry that the obvious result of the surgery - that I can see just about perfectly - doesn't fill me with the kind of joy you might expect.</p> <p>But I manage to read the paper, take the subway to my newspaper's office in Times Square, recognise most of my colleagues and have lunch with the entire New York Times foreign desk without spilling any food. I drop in at Dr C's. He does some tests and then afterwards says something that I never expected to hear in this lifetime: 'Your vision is 20-20.'</p> <p>I pay him. The operation is costing me a month's salary, but with these results, it certainly seems worth it.</p> <p><b> Week 1</b></p> <p>My eyesight seems to be getting worse. I think of Flowers for Algernon , a story I read a long time ago that was (and I may be getting this wrong) about a happy, retarded person who takes drugs that make him smart, and who gradually becomes retarded again as the drugs stop working. And he's never happy again, because somewhere in the depths of his simple mind he remembers what it was like to be smart. What if I'm going blind, after my brief flirtation with perfect eyesight?</p> <p>The truth is that I can function well enough in the world, but I feel tired and spaced out and off-balance. All I want to do, really, is stay in bed and read, but my eyes are so dry and irritated that I can't read for long. I panic, of course. I am stupid and vain and impetuous and I have made a dreadful mistake. You should never trust technology, because as much as you try to control it, it will always end up controlling you.</p> <p>The flight back to London is terrible. Whatever it is - the air pressure, the dryness of the cabin, my general hysteria - conspires to make my eyes feel like someone is blowing sand into them through a straw. I have to put drops in every five minutes. It's like being 18 and stoned and addicted to Visine.</p> <p><b> Week 2</b></p> <p>This week isn't so great, either. My eyes don't hurt, but the vision in my left eye seems markedly worse than that in my right eye, and I seem to need the eyedrops more than ever. What's this all about? I phone Dr C in panic, but he tells me not to worry.</p> <p>I send a distressed e-mail to my colleague Maureen in Washington, who had the surgery some months ago and is as happy as an eagle now. 'You don't remember the blurriness,' she says.</p> <p><b> Weeks 3-5</b></p> <p>Maureen is right. As each day improves a little bit, I'm starting to forget how uneasy I felt before. And I'm starting to take seeing for granted, the way other people do.</p> <p>I'm not sure what the epiphanal moment is. Maybe it's when I wake up with a start in a hotel room, start to grope for my glasses and then realise that I can read the time on the clock, flashing red across the room. Maybe it's when I'm dozing off in bed with my seven-month-old baby and find that I don't have to get up and take out my contacts, because I'm not wearing any. Or maybe it's when I finally chuck the whole expensive lot - lenses, cases, cleaning supplies, vials for soaking and storing and enzymatically scrubbing - into the garbage bin, like someone discarding an unwanted old skin.</p> <p>Of course, it isn't as if I can suddenly see after never been able to see before. People whose short-sightedness is correctable, as mine was, are hardly in the same category as people who are blind. But I can't believe how much this has meant to me. I never trusted my eyes before. I always felt I had the ability to see only on sufferance, as an ephemeral privilege that had been granted to me but that could vanish in a moment.</p> <p>And, of course, there was all that worrying that my contact lenses would tear or shred or melt or fly out of my eyes, that my glasses would break, that I would be in a storm, lose my contacts, fall on my glasses, and then die of exposure when I couldn't find my way out of the woods.</p> <p>There is none of that now. There is just me and a pair of eyes which are facing the world without any help, and which feel better and brighter and more acute than they ever have before.</p>",

It was the start of a long period of bad eyesight and bad eyeglasses: bulbous tortoiseshell ones in the Seventies; bulbous silver ones during the Eighties, and horrible little round ones in later years. I got contact lenses when I was 12 and spent the next 20 years putting them in and taking them out, cleaning them, soaking them and watching them drift away into the netherworld that is the bathroom floor, never to be seen again. I lost the first one in a hurricane on Long Island in 1978. I lost the last one in my house in London in 1999. But I'm used to being nearly blind. (This is how nearly blind I am: my eyesight is roughly 20-2,000, meaning that what a perfectly sighted person can see from 2,000 feet - ie, blobs of grey - I can see from 20 feet.) I'm used to the morning ritual of running my hand across the bedside table to 'look' for my glasses. I'm used to the non-lens-magnified world, a wash of muted colours and bleeding lights. I enjoy long, maudlin reveries about how if I lived in the Dark Ages, I would be one of the blind people in the village, begging for scraps of food by the side of the road as citizens kicked me and laughed at the rags hanging pathetically from my gaunt body. I've always blamed a number of my most glaring problems on poor eyesight, including a fear of heights; an inability to remember what people look like, even ones I met five minutes earlier; and a tendency to drive erratically, sometimes like a little old lady, and sometimes as if there is a fire on the road behind me. What will happen, I wonder, when I lose the ability to not see? 25 October The doctor has ordered me not to wear contacts or eye make-up for 10 days before the surgery, at a key time when I have to go to a lot of parties, including the Booker Prize. This period of hell, in which I am forced to wear my highly unflattering glasses publicly (latest pair: tiny, little wire frames, like those of a mole) without benefit of cosmetic enhancement, reminds me why I want the surgery so badly. 26 October I present myself at Dr C's office, pleased with the drugs I have been prescribed: Valium for nerves and Percocet for pain. I took Percocet recreationally in the Eighties! This should be fun. I throw back a Valium, under orders, so that I will be 'compliant' during the surgery. I take my place in the waiting-room of the laser lab, with a number of other patients, all of them men in their thirties who have brought their wives. I have brought my mother. I sit down in the laser room, surrounded by nurses whose job is to grip my hands in order to prevent me from leaping, screaming, from the chair. I am not going to give full details of the surgery - the clamping of the lid, the minute cut to the eye with some sort of implement, the lasering of the inside - because they are not for the squeamish (if you want a grislier description, you can e-mail me, lyall@nytimes.com, but I have to warn you that I do not understand exactly what happened). 'It's such a pleasure to operate on blue eyes!' Dr C says, by way of making me stop whimpering. It only takes a couple of minutes per eye and, weirdly, there's no pain at all. But it's very, very strange and uncomfortable. I have been instructed to stare directly at a blinking red light. 'Whatever you do, DON'T LOOK AWAY,' the doctor repeatedly warns - and all I want to do is look away, just to see what would happen. But I don't. I can't even smell burning eyeball, which some people have warned me about. Afterwards, my eyes feel dry and scratchy and I don't want to open them ever again. But when I do, it's clear that my vision has already dramatically improved. I go home and take a long sleep, fortified by my nice tablets. 27 October As instructed, I'm putting in eyedrops every hour, three different kinds, and my eyes are so dry that the obvious result of the surgery - that I can see just about perfectly - doesn't fill me with the kind of joy you might expect. But I manage to read the paper, take the subway to my newspaper's office in Times Square, recognise most of my colleagues and have lunch with the entire New York Times foreign desk without spilling any food. I drop in at Dr C's. He does some tests and then afterwards says something that I never expected to hear in this lifetime: 'Your vision is 20-20.' I pay him. The operation is costing me a month's salary, but with these results, it certainly seems worth it. Week 1 My eyesight seems to be getting worse. I think of Flowers for Algernon , a story I read a long time ago that was (and I may be getting this wrong) about a happy, retarded person who takes drugs that make him smart, and who gradually becomes retarded again as the drugs stop working. And he's never happy again, because somewhere in the depths of his simple mind he remembers what it was like to be smart. What if I'm going blind, after my brief flirtation with perfect eyesight? The truth is that I can function well enough in the world, but I feel tired and spaced out and off-balance. All I want to do, really, is stay in bed and read, but my eyes are so dry and irritated that I can't read for long. I panic, of course. I am stupid and vain and impetuous and I have made a dreadful mistake. You should never trust technology, because as much as you try to control it, it will always end up controlling you. The flight back to London is terrible. Whatever it is - the air pressure, the dryness of the cabin, my general hysteria - conspires to make my eyes feel like someone is blowing sand into them through a straw. I have to put drops in every five minutes. It's like being 18 and stoned and addicted to Visine. Week 2 This week isn't so great, either. My eyes don't hurt, but the vision in my left eye seems markedly worse than that in my right eye, and I seem to need the eyedrops more than ever. What's this all about? I phone Dr C in panic, but he tells me not to worry. I send a distressed e-mail to my colleague Maureen in Washington, who had the surgery some months ago and is as happy as an eagle now. 'You don't remember the blurriness,' she says. Weeks 3-5 Maureen is right. As each day improves a little bit, I'm starting to forget how uneasy I felt before. And I'm starting to take seeing for granted, the way other people do. I'm not sure what the epiphanal moment is. Maybe it's when I wake up with a start in a hotel room, start to grope for my glasses and then realise that I can read the time on the clock, flashing red across the room. Maybe it's when I'm dozing off in bed with my seven-month-old baby and find that I don't have to get up and take out my contacts, because I'm not wearing any. Or maybe it's when I finally chuck the whole expensive lot - lenses, cases, cleaning supplies, vials for soaking and storing and enzymatically scrubbing - into the garbage bin, like someone discarding an unwanted old skin. Of course, it isn't as if I can suddenly see after never been able to see before. People whose short-sightedness is correctable, as mine was, are hardly in the same category as people who are blind. But I can't believe how much this has meant to me. I never trusted my eyes before. I always felt I had the ability to see only on sufferance, as an ephemeral privilege that had been granted to me but that could vanish in a moment. And, of course, there was all that worrying that my contact lenses would tear or shred or melt or fly out of my eyes, that my glasses would break, that I would be in a storm, lose my contacts, fall on my glasses, and then die of exposure when I couldn't find my way out of the woods. There is none of that now. There is just me and a pair of eyes which are facing the world without any help, and which feel better and brighter and more acute than they ever have before.",

Yet that said, from these fetid slums would emerge the new working-class heroes, the singers and dancers who were to be the stars of the brightly lit boulevards. In any case, so successful had Haussmann been in concentrating the shanty towns and crumbling tenements at the city's outer rim that most visitors to Paris had no idea of what lay beyond the sparkling new department stores and fashionable restaurants.</p> <p>The city went to considerable lengths to promote its role as the centre of all that was new and exciting, holding a series of universal exhibitions to showcase the best in art and commerce. Held at regular intervals throughout the nineteenth century, these were self-contained cities within the greater metropolis, each an experimental environment where the new could be unveiled in an atmosphere that was part scientific demonstration, part funfair.

But to most visitors, the biggest attractions were not the formal displays of new industrial products but thrilling spectacles like the Cineorama, prefiguring the first Zeppelin flight later that year.</p> <p>Clearly, most people viewed technological advance as just another form of entertainment, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the most important element in big city life was less the new drains and street-lights and more the rise of the new showbusiness, a world of professional performers, some of whom became the first 'stars', worshipped by an adoring public - for a time at least. Much of the credit for this must go to an extraordinary Spaniard, Joseph Oller, who has some claim to be the father of modern showbusiness. He owned a swimming pool, an aquarium and the Nouveau Cirque on the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 that featured the first tip-up chairs, an Oller invention which soon spread to virtually every modern theatre on the planet.</p> <p>Oller quickly realised that when the Parisians abandoned their city in the hot summer months, his audience was largely made up of foreign visitors eager to sample the sort of amusements unknown to less fun-loving capital cities. Thus the canny showman began to frequent the working-class dance halls where he saw how supposedly respectable bourgeois folk were attracted to an atmosphere of risk and sensuality, provided things did not get out of hand. What they wanted was the sight of La Goulue kicking her feet so high it might just be possible to imagine you had seen something utterly forbidden. What they did not like were fights and pickpockets. Having reached this conclusion, Oller decided to give them what he guessed they wanted. When the Moulin Rouge opened its doors on Sunday 6 October 1889, so much anticipation had built up that the place was crammed with people of all kinds, from the fashionable to the merely curious, with a sufficient sprinkling of the rough to convince the rest that the place was nicely naughty.</p> <p>The greatest draw was certainly the place itself - a cavernous dance hall lit by newly-fangled electric lights that added sparkle to the crowded scene, which was whipped into a frenzy when the line of shrieking dancers dashed on to the floor and began their synchronised, high-kicking can-can.</p> <p>From the start, the Moulin Rouge was a succ\u00e8s de scandale , for there was, of course, another equally blatant side to the club's activities - it was quite simply the biggest open market for sex in the capital, though this was only the latest manifestation of what was probably the most extraordinary by-product of the new city - the plentiful provision of all manner of sexual distractions for the male population. This was a growth industry that was itself an offshoot of the startling changes that urban existence had brought to the lives of many men during the fin de si\u00e8cle.</p> <p>We can see something of this in the art of Degas who was obsessed by that curious mirror-image to all those sparkling new restaurants and dance halls, the dimly-lit world of the brothel. In the main, Degas avoided the most clich\u00e9d aspects of bought love, which was often glossed as a merry romp in the glittering crystal-lit salons of the capital, though he stops short of exposing the maisons de tol\u00e9rance, the licensed brothels, as the places of exploitation they clearly were. In some of his prints he appears to be taking much the same line as Guy de Maupassant did in his short stories, where the local brothel is a sort of jolly cat house, with saucy women who are inclined to jump into bed with each other or to cuddle up to the madame on her name-day.</p> <p>Like Maupassant, Degas shows the humble, side-street maison-close, the cheap, plain establishment frequented by increasing numbers of unattached males, a result of the shift in population from village and town to city that so fractured nineteenth-century existence. Similar concerns can be detected in some of Degas's paintings of young women at work in the city and the studies of ballet dancers that are among his best-known pictures. To those who have derived much innocent pleasure from these apparently innocuous works, the idea that there is a link with the brothel will seem preposterous, until you accept that they contain coded messages about a role forced on many women at the time.</p> <p>Rapid urbanisation and the consequent weakening of family and marriage ties, from the middle of the century on, had radically altered women's lives, throwing many into low-paid employment as shop assistants, waitresses, seamstresses, laundresses, hairdressers, servants and milliners. Insecure and unprotected, many saw no alternative to accepting the advances of any man willing to offer a 'present' for their services.</p> <p>At two to four francs a day, a Parisian milliner could not have survived without some form of additional income, and a contemporary study of registered prostitutes reveals that 75 per cent of the filles inscrites had migrated from the provinces to Paris where they initially worked in drink shops, laundries and sewing studios until financial reality forced them to become sex-workers.</p> <p>All this would have been well enough known to anyone looking at a Degas painting of a millinery shop at the time. Likewise, the young girls training to be ballet dancers, whom Degas shows practising at the barre or slumped in repose. These unsmiling figures are slaving to liberate themselves from the marginal world of their mothers, those seamstresses and laundresses, sometimes glimpsed in the background, dressed in prim black bonnet and clutching a formidable handbag in an attempt to generate an air of bourgeois respectability. In reality, the ballet was a brothel by other means, and the men who hung around the opera house were as often found backstage in the rehearsal studios or corridors, rather than front of house engrossed by the performance.</p> <p>There was another side to this dismal picture. A few women found that the breakdown of the restrictive moral and legal code that had dominated the century offered them the chance to free themselves from the constraints of marriage and child-rearing. It is this that the art of Toulouse-Lautrec often reveals in his studies of the new stars like the dancers Jane Avril and La Goulue and the singer Yvette Guilbert, who chose to have lesbian relationships rather than tie themselves to a man who would almost certainly have tried to control their careers. Inevitably perhaps, many men felt threatened by these 'new-women'; hence all the sinful Eves and seductive Salom\u00e9s - woman as temptress, woman as destroyer - that turn up so often in fin-de-si\u00e8cle art.</p> <p>Many paid a heavy price for trying to go it alone. La Goulue ended up a hopeless drunk, eking out her last years in the filthy shanty town on the northern slope of Montmartre, so different from the glittering world on the opposite side, where she had been the greatest of all the new stars. But that was another of the contradictions inherent in the new urban jungle - La Goulue began as a poor laundress, rocketed to showbusiness heaven, then plunged back to finish among rag pickers and petty thieves on the very edge of city life.

The twentieth century began with the paper assessing the risk of Germany declaring war to take advantage of the setbacks of the Boer War. Third time lucky.</p> <p>This time round, our first editorial of the century - and of the millennium - does not have to fear Britain suffering invasion, war and conquest. There are local wars and barbarisms - events in Chechnya and Kosovo this year have been a salutary reminder. Human rights are disregarded too frequently and by too many.</p> <p>But the world's Great Powers are no longer dancing a diplomatic minuet in which war is part of the armoury of statecraft and the acquisition of territory, raw materials, booty and Empire is the intent. In this respect, the first 45 years of the last century represented a continuum with the past; the last 55 years, in which most of today's population were born, represent a remarkable era of prosperity, technological progress and emancipation - and a discontinuity with what has happened before.</p> <p>It is a period during which the position of women has been transformed, the European colonial empires have been dismantled and the dictatorial rule of communism found wanting. Science and technology have transformed our lives, now driving forward with the human genome project and the mobile phone in the way they have done with penicillin and the motor car. Life expectancy has jumped even in the less developed world; illiteracy and innumeracy have fallen; the range of opportunity and lifestyle for ordinary men and women in the advanced democracies is unequalled in richness and diversity. For most people in the West and a growing proportion in the rest of the globe, it is better to be alive in 2000 than in any year before.</p> <p>But the open question is whether this peace and prosperity will last. For example, a fervent Russian nationalist, bent on maintaining the Russian empire, has this weekend succeeded Boris Yeltsin as Russian President and now directs the still formidable Russian military machine, complete with its nuclear arsenal. China retains imperial ambitions. Both could menace global peace. As fundamental, at a time when capitalism is unchallenged as the organising principle of the global economy, is whether we are any nearer to solving the perennial problem about how to marry its dynamic properties with social justice, community and individual well-being.</p> <p>What are the boundaries of the market and market values? How are values like trust, friendship, altruism and respect for the obligations of family to co-exist with the maximisation of profit and the reduction of every relationship to a commodity to be bought and sold? How do societies alleviate the inequality that capitalism brings? And as each individual country wrestles with the issues, how are they to be prevented from exporting their problems to others and so precipitating trade and military rivalry? At a minimum, the tensions can provoke financial collapses and runs on currencies and stock markets; at worst, as we have witnessed over the last century, the consequences are war and mayhem.</p> <p><b>New barbarism</b></p> <p>The honest answer is that we are no nearer to solving these problems than our forebears. It is just as plausible to argue that we stand on the verge of a new barbarism, in which the economic and social gains we enjoy disappear in a welter of nationalism, local wars, financial crises and trade protection, as it is to argue that the decades ahead will build and extend the progress we have experienced over the last 55 years. Hence the fevered nature of millennium debate, increasingly polarised between optimists and pessimists.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, nobody would have predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-emergence of American economic hegemony; whatever happens in 20 years time we can be sure that it will not have been predicted today. But there are some broad grounds for optimism. In economic terms, inflation has subsided and the new information technologies promise to unleash a surge in productivity, the underlying driver of economic growth. If capitalism is broadly accepted worldwide as the least bad way of organising economic activity - the explicit coda of globalisation - there is a parallel recognition that the circumstances of the poor and disadvantaged have to be underwritten by welfare systems. Health and education have to be provided by the state. In social terms, sexual and racial discrimination are in retreat, although nothing like as rapidly as they should be.</p> <p>There is a growing, if reluctant, recognition that environmental risk must be taken seriously. The advantage of information technology is that it forces transparency and accountability on everyone; the reaction to injustice, bad practice and incompetence in the public and private spheres has to be faster because the dissemination of information is faster. More than that, as economies grow ever more interdependent as a result of the vast new flows of trade and finance, there is a global interest in managing the global economy in a global interest. Even in Russia and China, there is a recognition of the pivotal role of markets, of the role of democracy and the rule of law, of the advantages of being open rather than closed to trade.</p> <p>The optimists can argue that the advantages of globalisation, along with the need to ease society through the sometimes painful social transition, are broadly accepted; the gains from science and technology will become globally disseminated and ever cheaper. The world, in short, is becoming a better place. But there is an equally strong case for pessimism. Everywhere, the new openness is matched by a growth of xenophobia and nationalism, counter the pessimists. Capitalism brings wealth, but it also brings economic and social dislocation, generally created by foreign corporations, foreign workers and foreign products. The natural response of every community is to husband the advantages of the trade and to blame the disadvantages on dastardly foreigners, especially if they are the lodebearers of another culture and its values.</p> <p>This was always true, but it is truer still with the new 'turbo-capitalism', as US economist Edward Luttwak calls its, propelled by mega corporations, embodying dramatic revolutionary changes in technology and more ruthlessly profit-seeking and global in its reach than ever before. The collapse of the communist bloc, the implosion of socialism as an idea, the decline in organised labour and the weakness of public institutions everywhere before the advance of the market has meant the opposing forces to capitalism have never been more feeble.</p> <p>Governments' capacity to ease the transitional costs and growing inequalities are increasingly inadequate. More than that, the contemporary global capitalist system is built on sand. International finance has ruptured national boundaries and has gone global with a capacity to speculate feverishly on a scale never witnessed before. Currencies of the world's largest economies - the US and Japan - can swing violently over months; for small economies, the movements are even more vicious.</p> <p>The warnings that Wall Street is a bubble stock market, with hugely inflated prices and prone to excessive speculation, may have become routine but they are no less serious; the contagion, via the speculation in loss-making Internet companies, is spreading to London. It will only take one overstretched bank or one unexpected economic calamity to knock the whole house of cards sideways and, given the international linkages, for the entire financial system to be sent reeling. International regulation is absent, domestic regulation weak and the capacity of the world's central banks and international monetary authorities to mobilise the scale of countervailing financial support wholly inadequate. An accident is waiting to happen.</p> <p>But, continue the pessimists, that is not all. The protests at the World Trade Organisation's meeting in Seattle, the co-ordinated protests by J18 centred in the City of London, and the assertiveness of the environmentalists are part of a wider movement in which society wants to assert other values and principles besides those of the maximisation of profits. In this sense, religious fundamentalism, whether Christian or Muslim, shares common ground with the green movement, the anti-capitalists and nationalists everywhere.</p> <p><b>Capitalism alone does not work</b></p> <p>The cold economic rationality of capitalism, in which every institution is subordinated to the calculus of profit and loss, does not answer the question posed to every human being and every society - that there is more to life than the pursuit of economic efficiency. We are social as well as economic beings.</p> <p>This question can be sidestepped when times are good; prosperity, spending and jobs are a remarkable economic and social lubricant. But if the system starts to falter or malfunction then the wider issues open up immediately. And the great Achilles' Heel of contemporary capitalism, even amid so much plenty, is that it is disfigured and pockmarked by inequality. The gap between the incomes of the rich and poor in the advanced democracies is widening and the disparity of wealth is extraordinary.</p> <p>As information technology drills deep into the make-up of our economy and society, so the capacity and access to the new technology is creating another layer of inequality. And if inequality between the top and bottom is widening, it is also widening within every sub-group of society; it is not only winners at the top who are paid disproportionately well, but at every level. Nor is that all. The disparity of income and wealth between countries is also becoming insupportable. More than a billion people live in abject poverty, their collective income no more than 600 of the richest men and women on Earth.</p> <p>This is the great truth about globalisation and the global business civilisation that is being built in its wake, but it remains the truth that dare not speak its name. The new intellectual fashion is not to worry about the so-called gap between rich and poor; the incomes of those at the top or who have done well are no longer of legitimate concern it is argued by the economic and political establishment; what matters is that there is a minimum safety net for those at the bottom, a tight labour market and the chance for everyone to acquire a vital minimum of educational and training skills. No wider effort at taming capitalism or reducing the scale of inequality can be attempted.</p> <p>The only realistic policy option is to do what can be done - run conservative economic policies and try to sustain an infrastructure of support for the poorest while turning a blind eye to the excesses of the rich. They and the markets and corporations they run will move elsewhere if regulation, taxation or public initiative are attempted. Less developed countries are seized by the same philosophy. If they want to grow, then they must accept the terms dictated by the West. They must deregulate, privatise, liberalise, roll back the public sector and give up on attempts to equalise income and wealth.</p> <p>Once they accept this agenda, then they can expect the great Western corporations to locate production there and bring with them technology, skills and employment. For the developed world, this means that, with even China now trying to join the WTO, there is the prospect of a genuine world labour market, in which their own working class is competing for jobs, with unskilled labour in the Third World prepared to work for as little as a dollar a day. If we think inequality now is becoming unacceptable, then what promises to unfold in the years ahead will take us into new realms.</p> <p>Yet the insouciance bordering on nonchalance with which this prospect is greeted by both the private- and public-sector proponents of globalisation promises to be a calamitous misjudgment, and in this respect the pessimists are right. We only need to look back to the beginning of the century to realise how in very similar circumstances - an emerging global market, an era of immense technological innovation and the creation of a world financial system - that the resulting inequalities had consequences that proved ungovernable and were the underlying driver of war and depression.</p> <p>It was the profound anger at economic and social inequality that underpinned the growth of socialism and communism in the first 40 years of the century, and it was the need to provide a counterbalancing force that fostered the fascist response. American isolation, then as now, meant that formal international co-operation in the League of Nations was a dead letter from the start. When the US stock market crashed, there were no financial firebreaks to stop the flames from spreading to the rest of the US and then the world's financial system.</p> <p><b>A real chance</b></p> <p>In short, the clash between inequality and the prevailing consensus that laissez-faire and free markets must remain untouched proved a disaster. Capitalism must be governed if its worst excesses are to be avoided, but when it slips its national moorings and goes global, as it did before 1914 and is doing now, then if the governing structures do not follow, society is exposed to the mercies of volatile markets and the quest for economic efficiencies. Society, one way or another, hits back.</p> <p>So as the century and millennium opens, the challenge could hardly be clearer, but economic and political leadership never more wanting. The United States has emerged as the world's unchallenged power, but it has become ever more brazen in its attempt to run the globe only according to its own interests, whether over defence or the role of the dollar. The European Union, which could be an effective compensating force, lacks confidence, cohesion or direction. The capacity to establish and assert a global interest, the over-riding need of our times, is thus gravely enfeebled.</p> <p>Yet the technologies and wealth that the optimists point to as the harbingers of better times do offer great possibilities. We can reinvent our cities and our societies. We can live better than ever and longer than ever. There are widening and wonderful choices open to us about how we live our lives. But to win those great prizes, we must do more than abdicate responsibility to markets and private corporations, as the new consensus is close to advocating. Instead, we must insist that the wealth they create be put to civic and social purpose, and that requires that we limit inequality, assert the case for justice and make our voice heard nationally and internationally through the only means open to us - democratic governance.</p> <p>Every tool at hand must be exploited, notably the EU. There is no choice in the matter. If we shrink from our responsibility, then this century could hold terrors more serious than the last. If we meet them, then we have a real chance to build an enduring and just civilisation. The great game begins.</p>",

The natural response of every community is to husband the advantages of the trade and to blame the disadvantages on dastardly foreigners, especially if they are the lodebearers of another culture and its values. This was always true, but it is truer still with the new 'turbo-capitalism', as US economist Edward Luttwak calls its, propelled by mega corporations, embodying dramatic revolutionary changes in technology and more ruthlessly profit-seeking and global in its reach than ever before. The collapse of the communist bloc, the implosion of socialism as an idea, the decline in organised labour and the weakness of public institutions everywhere before the advance of the market has meant the opposing forces to capitalism have never been more feeble. Governments' capacity to ease the transitional costs and growing inequalities are increasingly inadequate. More than that, the contemporary global capitalist system is built on sand. International finance has ruptured national boundaries and has gone global with a capacity to speculate feverishly on a scale never witnessed before. Currencies of the world's largest economies - the US and Japan - can swing violently over months; for small economies, the movements are even more vicious. The warnings that Wall Street is a bubble stock market, with hugely inflated prices and prone to excessive speculation, may have become routine but they are no less serious; the contagion, via the speculation in loss-making Internet companies, is spreading to London. It will only take one overstretched bank or one unexpected economic calamity to knock the whole house of cards sideways and, given the international linkages, for the entire financial system to be sent reeling. International regulation is absent, domestic regulation weak and the capacity of the world's central banks and international monetary authorities to mobilise the scale of countervailing financial support wholly inadequate. An accident is waiting to happen. But, continue the pessimists, that is not all. The protests at the World Trade Organisation's meeting in Seattle, the co-ordinated protests by J18 centred in the City of London, and the assertiveness of the environmentalists are part of a wider movement in which society wants to assert other values and principles besides those of the maximisation of profits. In this sense, religious fundamentalism, whether Christian or Muslim, shares common ground with the green movement, the anti-capitalists and nationalists everywhere. Capitalism alone does not work The cold economic rationality of capitalism, in which every institution is subordinated to the calculus of profit and loss, does not answer the question posed to every human being and every society - that there is more to life than the pursuit of economic efficiency. We are social as well as economic beings. This question can be sidestepped when times are good; prosperity, spending and jobs are a remarkable economic and social lubricant. But if the system starts to falter or malfunction then the wider issues open up immediately. And the great Achilles' Heel of contemporary capitalism, even amid so much plenty, is that it is disfigured and pockmarked by inequality. The gap between the incomes of the rich and poor in the advanced democracies is widening and the disparity of wealth is extraordinary. As information technology drills deep into the make-up of our economy and society, so the capacity and access to the new technology is creating another layer of inequality. And if inequality between the top and bottom is widening, it is also widening within every sub-group of society; it is not only winners at the top who are paid disproportionately well, but at every level. Nor is that all. The disparity of income and wealth between countries is also becoming insupportable. More than a billion people live in abject poverty, their collective income no more than 600 of the richest men and women on Earth. This is the great truth about globalisation and the global business civilisation that is being built in its wake, but it remains the truth that dare not speak its name. The new intellectual fashion is not to worry about the so-called gap between rich and poor; the incomes of those at the top or who have done well are no longer of legitimate concern it is argued by the economic and political establishment; what matters is that there is a minimum safety net for those at the bottom, a tight labour market and the chance for everyone to acquire a vital minimum of educational and training skills. No wider effort at taming capitalism or reducing the scale of inequality can be attempted. The only realistic policy option is to do what can be done - run conservative economic policies and try to sustain an infrastructure of support for the poorest while turning a blind eye to the excesses of the rich. They and the markets and corporations they run will move elsewhere if regulation, taxation or public initiative are attempted. Less developed countries are seized by the same philosophy. If they want to grow, then they must accept the terms dictated by the West. They must deregulate, privatise, liberalise, roll back the public sector and give up on attempts to equalise income and wealth. Once they accept this agenda, then they can expect the great Western corporations to locate production there and bring with them technology, skills and employment. For the developed world, this means that, with even China now trying to join the WTO, there is the prospect of a genuine world labour market, in which their own working class is competing for jobs, with unskilled labour in the Third World prepared to work for as little as a dollar a day. If we think inequality now is becoming unacceptable, then what promises to unfold in the years ahead will take us into new realms. Yet the insouciance bordering on nonchalance with which this prospect is greeted by both the private- and public-sector proponents of globalisation promises to be a calamitous misjudgment, and in this respect the pessimists are right. We only need to look back to the beginning of the century to realise how in very similar circumstances - an emerging global market, an era of immense technological innovation and the creation of a world financial system - that the resulting inequalities had consequences that proved ungovernable and were the underlying driver of war and depression. It was the profound anger at economic and social inequality that underpinned the growth of socialism and communism in the first 40 years of the century, and it was the need to provide a counterbalancing force that fostered the fascist response. American isolation, then as now, meant that formal international co-operation in the League of Nations was a dead letter from the start. When the US stock market crashed, there were no financial firebreaks to stop the flames from spreading to the rest of the US and then the world's financial system. A real chance In short, the clash between inequality and the prevailing consensus that laissez-faire and free markets must remain untouched proved a disaster. Capitalism must be governed if its worst excesses are to be avoided, but when it slips its national moorings and goes global, as it did before 1914 and is doing now, then if the governing structures do not follow, society is exposed to the mercies of volatile markets and the quest for economic efficiencies. Society, one way or another, hits back. So as the century and millennium opens, the challenge could hardly be clearer, but economic and political leadership never more wanting. The United States has emerged as the world's unchallenged power, but it has become ever more brazen in its attempt to run the globe only according to its own interests, whether over defence or the role of the dollar. The European Union, which could be an effective compensating force, lacks confidence, cohesion or direction. The capacity to establish and assert a global interest, the over-riding need of our times, is thus gravely enfeebled. Yet the technologies and wealth that the optimists point to as the harbingers of better times do offer great possibilities. We can reinvent our cities and our societies. We can live better than ever and longer than ever. There are widening and wonderful choices open to us about how we live our lives. But to win those great prizes, we must do more than abdicate responsibility to markets and private corporations, as the new consensus is close to advocating. Instead, we must insist that the wealth they create be put to civic and social purpose, and that requires that we limit inequality, assert the case for justice and make our voice heard nationally and internationally through the only means open to us - democratic governance. Every tool at hand must be exploited, notably the EU. There is no choice in the matter. If we shrink from our responsibility, then this century could hold terrors more serious than the last. If we meet them, then we have a real chance to build an enduring and just civilisation. The great game begins.",

      "body": "<p>It has been hyped as our saviour, the panacea that will rid mankind of disease. But gene therapy - the use of genetic engineering technology to alter patients' DNA - is giving its practitioners a sudden crisis of confidence. The cause lies with a simple mystery: why did a relatively fit 18-year-old drop dead four days after a genetically altered virus was injected into his liver? The aim was to introduce genes to rectify an enzyme deficiency that Arizona-born Jesse Gelsinger had inherited. The effect was to trigger 'a systemic inflammatory response'. Gelsinger's temperature soared to 104\u00b0F, he slumped into a coma, his lungs filled with fluid, and within four days he had died, on 17 September, in the University of Pennsylvania hospital in Philadelphia. His death has baffled gene therapists already beset by accusations that their technique has failed to live up to the hype surrounding its introduction 10 years ago. Now they face a new problem: perhaps the very basis of their technology poses dangers to patients, a prospect sufficiently worrying to lead to the temporary suspension of many US gene therapy trials after Gelsinger's death. Understanding why he became the first person to die directly as a result of gene therapy has therefore assumed considerable medical importance, as well as being a family tragedy. 'I lost a hero,' Paul Gelsinger said of his son, who fought a long, debilitating battle against the metabolic disease for which he was being treated. Gene therapy for humans began in 1990, when US researchers exploited science's burgeoning knowledge of human genetics to treat Cynthia Cutshall and Ashanthi Desilva, two youngsters who suffered from the same severe immune disorder that plagued John Travolta's character in the 1976 TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. First, cancer specialists led by French Anderson and based in Bethesda, outside Washington, isolated the gene missing from the girls' complement of DNA, inserted it into a virus and used this to infect their cells - the aim being to add the missing gene to their genetic make-up. The experiment was successful, though the effect was not permanent and has to be repeated every few months. Nevertheless, the girls were transformed from sickly, housebound toddlers into exuberant, lively youngsters, and the team's triumph led to a massive hype for gene therapy with Anderson being ranked by Time magazine beside Hippocrates and Pasteur as one of history's most important physicians. However, 10 years later, the case of Cynthia and Ashanthi remains a rare success, one of the field's notable exceptions. Three hundred clinical gene therapy trials on about 3,000 patients - involving dozens of different diseases, from brain tumours to cystic fibrosis to inherited heart conditions - have improved the lives of only a handful of people, and have yet to bring about a full cure of a single patient. Now the therapy has killed one of them. 'There has been a massive amount of hype about gene therapy,' said Oxford geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer. 'And while it may seem a good idea to introduce missing genes into patients to cure their illnesses, there is a real problem of how you do that. Most techniques involve the use of genetically engineered viruses. And that is where the problems begin. The viruses have to be neutralised in some way, and there is no effective way they can be guided so that they insert missing genes into the right place in patients' chromosomes.' Researchers have struggled to improve their accuracy at gene insertion but have yet to report significant breakthroughs. In addition, they have faced the constant problem of ensuring their virus vectors are safe - and it is here that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy appear to have come unstuck. A total of 18 patients suffering from the same enzyme deficiency were treated with an adenovirus - a class of virus that causes colds and other conditions. The virus had been altered to carry a gene that would control their ailment but had also been crippled so as not to cause illness on its own. But the team had to give a massive dose to try to get enough of the missing gene into their patients, and Gelsinger received the biggest of all: 38 trillion particles of virus. The group still failed to get the new gene to express itself in any patients and, in Gelsinger's case, appears to have triggered a deadly reaction, though exactly how remains a mystery. At a recent public meeting at the US National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, the leader of the Penn team, Dr James Wilson, spent two days answering scientists' questions about Gelsinger's death to try to find the answer. Many argued that the young man's response was unusual; others suggested such a fatality was waiting to happen. 'You don't need to evoke anything weird,' Art Beaudet, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told the journal Science. The publication also quotes a federal official who admitted that the case had done 'damage to gene therapy', and reports that the US Food and Drug Administration has found 'deviations' from trial protocols that may lead to a reprimand for the project leaders. The decision will be a blow to the Pennsylvania team but, far more important, it will underline the stark dilemmas that now beset this 'wonder science'. Either the researchers do not use enough virus and therefore find they cannot get enough life-saving genes into patients' cells or they run the risk of using too much, thus triggering an abnormal, possibly fatal, reaction. 'Gene therapy will have its uses,' said Bodmer. 'It has great potential for attacking cancer, for example. However, as a cure-all, as a panacea, it clearly has limitations. It is far more likely that the knowledge that is now pouring from laboratories round the world about our genes will be exploited to create better and better pharmaceuticals, rather than directly tinkering with our genetic make-up. That is where the real future of medicine lies.'</p>",

And the final doll? A son of Mother Russia, a patriot, yes, and one, thank God, whose impetuousness stopped short of hitting the nuclear button in the middle of some wild vodka binge.</p> <p>But Boris Yeltsin will go down in history as the man who launched a New Russia, which had hoped to be democratic and free and not mired in poverty, and then drank himself into a stupor as the whole glorious adventure went rotten from the core. Yeltsin turned out to be too drunk, too sick, too choleric, too greedy and too corrupt to make old Russia embrace the open society. His chosen successor, Vladimir Putin, is a thin-lipped, near-silent ex-spy, an old KGB man with all the hallmarks of an assassin. Not much of a result for democracy, then; still less a legacy for his country.</p> <p>There is no doubting Yeltsin's guts, or that he has always been a proper Russian. In 1930, Ignaty Yeltsin, a well-off peasant of Butka village, in the Urals' main town of Sverdlovsk, was declared a kulak - a land-owning peasant - all but a death sentence under Stalin's rolling terror. His house, mill, farm animals were confiscated by order of the State. His grandfather fled. On 1 February, 1931, a grandson was born to the disgraced family, Boris Nikolayevich. Soon afterwards the family moved to Kazan, in the land of the Tartars.</p> <p>When young Boris was only three, his father, Nikolai Yeltsin, was arrested and convicted of 'anti-Soviet agitation'. He served three years in Stalin's notorious gulag, and Boris's mother made ends meet by working as a seamstress. The young Yeltsin was never a quiet stay-at-home. He blew off two fingers on his left hand while playing with a live grenade. Boris played volleyball and graduated in construction at the Ural Polytechnic in Sverdlovsk. In 1956, three years after Stalin's death, Yeltsin married his college sweetheart, Naina Iosifovna Girina. They have two daughters, Yelena and Tatiana, born in 1957 and 1959 respectively.</p> <p>Yeltsin drank and worked and drank and played tennis and ground his up way through the stultified hierarchy of the old Soviet Union. He joined the Communist Party in 1961, and from then on he was firmly planted on the up escalator of power. A seemingly boring list of job promotions forms the official history. The real one is more Kafkaesque. In 1977 Yeltsin received an order from the Kremlin to destroy the beautiful and historic Ipatyev House, the site of the Bolsheviks' killing of the last Tsar, Nicholas II, and his family in 1918. Yeltsin obeyed. By morning every brick, including the foundations, had been taken to the city dump and the site was paved with the smoothest asphalt.</p> <p>In 1985, Yeltsin was moved to Moscow. He was a construction boss, brilliant at energising workers and getting the factories and houses up. In late 1985, as the torpor and decay of the old Soviet Union seemed ever more obvious, Yeltsin was made city boss of Moscow.</p> <p>But Yeltin's impetuousness got the better of him. In October 1987 he lashed out at his fellow party bosses, condemning the slow pace of reform. The knives were out for him and he fell from power. Heart trouble followed. Two years later he came powering back, elected to the old Soviet parliament as member for Moscow. In 1990 he was elected Speaker, recognised as the most reform-minded politician in the country. He scented the change in the air which the leadership, under Mikhail Gorbachev, feared to act on. In July, Yeltsin left the party that had broken his grandfather. The Soviet Union started to splinter. A year later, Yeltsin was elected President of the Russian Federation. The old, neo-Stalinist guard struck on 20 August, 1991, seizing Gorbachev in the Crimea and seeking Yeltsin's resignation.</p> <p>Instead Yeltsin drove down to the centre of Moscow, stepped on tank number 110, and told the coup plotters to get stuffed - or words to that effect. The coup crumbled, but Gorbachev was finished too. Yeltsin stepped smartly into the power vacuum and created the new Russia. As was his right, he became its first President, but the economy, freed from the grip of dirigisme, all but collapsed. Crime grew rampant and Yeltsin signally failed to get a grip on the State's finances. The wags called the first stage of his economic reforms 'shock without therapy'.</p> <p>Worse was to follow. But the old guard had not had their final say. They seized the White House of Russia. Yeltsin called in the army and the building was shelled with tanks and set on fire.

      "body": "<p><strong>THE YEAR FOR EVERYONE</strong></p> <p>May 2000 sees no fewer than six planets clustered in the sign of Taurus. Two of these, Jupiter and Saturn, form a conjunction every 20 years: the ebb and flow of this Jupiter-Saturn cycle marks changes in social and economic behaviour.</p> <p>The May 2000 cycle is particularly special as it occurs within days of turning points being reached in other major cycles. As the planets involved are slow-moving, some dramas are already unfolding. Taurus is associated with the farming industry, where radical change and reform are becoming necessary. The construction industry is also likely to be affected. </p> <p>But the greatest effect is probably to be felt by the banks. Their problems seem centred on dealing with electronic fraud, with the danger of some banks collapsing. Property prices in the UK are also likely to be affected by this rare planetary line-up, with some properties in the South East scaling dizzier heights. However it may be far more common for properties to lose value.</p> <p>Interest rate rises form only part of the story. A shifting water table, combined with disturbed weather patterns, looks set to bring subsidence problems. Anyone living near water or at the foot of hills should be especially vigilant and prepare for possible flooding. It is also possible that 2000 will see a rise in negative equity. As the summer passes, Jupiter and Pluto move to oppose one another, and this sets the stage for tension in the travel and communications industries. Anticipate mergers in these fields as smaller companies find themselves unable to compete in global price wars. </p> <p>Four solar eclipses take place in 2000. Between them they affect more than half the FTSE 250 companies. As eclipses mark endings and beginnings, anticipate a bumpy ride on the markets in 2000, especially around 5 February and 1 and 31 July.</p> <p><strong>AND SIGN BY SIGN</strong></p> <p><strong>Aries</strong><br> 21 March - 20 April<br> With so many planets focused in a prominently financial area of your solar chart, May promises to be an exciting month. This is the time to invest in the local small craftsman and/or to do some self-investment. But cashflow problems could stunt fast growth if your business plan is unsound. July could be especially difficult. New strategies have to be implemented in August. Investments bring gains in the autumn, when a proposed merger increases the value of your portfolio. As the year closes, changes in your domestic circumstances release capital for yet another venture.</p> <p><strong>Taurus</strong><br> 21 April - 20 May<br> You could be both shocked and disillusioned by events in the first six months of 2000. It is clear that major changes have to be made both to your lifestyle and to your investment strategy. You may resist change, but it is inevitable. The 31 July solar eclipse marks the end of one financial phase. Making the most of new opportunities requires that you develop new information sources. Put energy into this and check the integrity of all information. There is potential for real gains in the latter half of the year - especially if commodities are involved. November offers gains through overseas investment.</p> <p><strong>Gemini</strong><br> 21 May - 20 June<br> During the first few months of the year you are reminded of the need to consider making provision for care in your old age. This means reviewing pensions, insurance policies and healthcare cover. Tackle these issues before the solar eclipse of 1 July, which sees a fresh start in your financial affairs. Increased responsibility at work brings some cash reward by September. The extra income is swallowed up by a new investment programme recommended to you in late July. This new financial regime ensures that you conclude 2000 in a better state of financial health than you began it.</p> <p> <strong>Cancer</strong><br> 21 June - 22 July<br> The solar eclipse of 5 February marks the end of a financial partnership. This is not bad news and heralds a new start. The planetary line-up for May brings cash-related fireworks that threaten to unsettle you. You find yourself undertaking major financial reconstruction in July. This could involve remortgaging or even a house move. During the summer you are advised to pay closer attention to long-term savings schemes. By early October you open yet another account. The solar eclipse of 25 December marks yet another financial gear change. This could be the start of more property or business investing.</p> <p> <strong>Leo</strong><br> 23 July - 22 August<br> Keep a tight rein on your money during January if you want to avoid a financial crash of one kind or another in February or again late in May. The year is not all bad news, and financial gain is probable. An eclipse in your sign on 31 July heralds a new financial partnership. The two great wealth-giving planets, Jupiter and Pluto, could leave you walking a financial tightrope during the early autumn. You can limit high drama by listening to advice from your partner. Moderate your speculative tendencies and invest in well- established companies to ensure a safe ending to the year.</p> <p> <strong>Virgo</strong><br> 23 August - 22 September <br> Finances receive a boost in February. But by March you find that the extra income is being eaten up by increased expenditure. Cost pruning is necessary in April. There are further shocks in the early part of May, but the last week of that month brings a reversal in your fortunes. You find yourself on the ground floor of a new business venture. Growth will be slow but sure. All your resources are stretched to the limits in September, but by mid-October you sense that rewards are on the way. Financial rewards reach you by early December and ensure a good ending to the year.</p> <p> <strong>Libra</strong><br> 23 September - 22 October<br> Embarking on a financial fitness programme gets 2000 off to a good start for you. By the 5 February eclipse, you need to have a clear idea of your goals. This could require pruning costs in March and April. In May you are asked to consider a new financial partnership. Throughout June and July you make good gains. Budget for increased costs in August. Financial restructuring is again necessary in September. The reward is reduced tax liability. A money crisis in October finds you temporarily at odds with a partner. Investing in a new property is under discussion as the year closes. </p> <p><strong>Scorpio</strong><br> 23 October - 22 November <br> It may not be until 2001 that you are finally free of one financial obligation. But it seems less of a burden in 2000 than it has been. From February onward you are aware of improvements in your financial affairs. New developments in May find you seizing opportunities that others overlook. But these stretch your cashflow to the limit through to mid-October. A turning point is reached then. Others look to you to resolve a financial dilemma in November. This earns you more respect and could lead to a lucrative offer being made in early December.</p> <p><strong>Sagittarius</strong><br> 22 November - 22 December <br> Your financial fortunes could change dramatically in 2000. Facts and figures demand your attention from the first few days of the year. By February the ebb and flow of your bank account is changing pattern. Meetings with accountants and financial advisers take extra time that month. Extra work in May and June increases income. The extra cash could boost a pension. More income can be generated at the start of the next academic year, when others offer to pay you for demonstrating your skills. This second source of income develops quickly and could even change your tax status before the end of the year. </p> <p><strong>Capricorn</strong><br> 23 December - 19 January<br> The year 2000 promises to be one of steady growth for you. That does not mean it is boring. In February you decide to pull out of one financial partnership. This releases cash and energy for work in new areas. Your attention is drawn to overseas investments in April and May. Tax problems demand attention from late August. A financial adviser plays an important role in September. Christmas finds you considering a new financial partnership. During the last few days of the year you consider making a large investment. Once again your adviser plays a key role.</p> <p><strong>Aquarius</strong><br> 20 January - 18 February<br> The solar eclipses of 5 February and 31 July signal dramatic changes in your fortunes. View these as the endings of chapters. The new chapters beginning offer greater financial security. You could feel unsettled during the last few days of May, when others seek your long-term commitment to a new project. Once you have made appropriate adjustments, you find that your cashflow improves during late August and the early autumn. A review of your savings is necessary in early December. Realising a dream could be more expensive than you think. Depleting earlier gains may not be wise.</p> <p><strong>Pisces</strong><br> 19 February - 20 March<br> The financial affairs of those closest to you have a dramatic impact on your life this year. Six weeks into the start of the year you sense that you need to make your own needs known. By May you are ready for a new beginning and in June you find the commercial opportunity that has been eluding you for some time. A new product or business venture brings fast rewards during the summer, but there are difficulties from mid-October. Others run themselves short of capital. It may prove difficult to balance the books as the year draws to a close.</p> <p><em> Christeen Skinner is an astrologist who specialises in economic, social and political affairs</em></p>",

Property prices in the UK are also likely to be affected by this rare planetary line-up, with some properties in the South East scaling dizzier heights. However it may be far more common for properties to lose value. Interest rate rises form only part of the story. A shifting water table, combined with disturbed weather patterns, looks set to bring subsidence problems. Anyone living near water or at the foot of hills should be especially vigilant and prepare for possible flooding. It is also possible that 2000 will see a rise in negative equity. As the summer passes, Jupiter and Pluto move to oppose one another, and this sets the stage for tension in the travel and communications industries. Anticipate mergers in these fields as smaller companies find themselves unable to compete in global price wars. Four solar eclipses take place in 2000. Between them they affect more than half the FTSE 250 companies. As eclipses mark endings and beginnings, anticipate a bumpy ride on the markets in 2000, especially around 5 February and 1 and 31 July. AND SIGN BY SIGN Aries 21 March - 20 April With so many planets focused in a prominently financial area of your solar chart, May promises to be an exciting month. This is the time to invest in the local small craftsman and/or to do some self-investment. But cashflow problems could stunt fast growth if your business plan is unsound. July could be especially difficult. New strategies have to be implemented in August. Investments bring gains in the autumn, when a proposed merger increases the value of your portfolio. As the year closes, changes in your domestic circumstances release capital for yet another venture. Taurus 21 April - 20 May You could be both shocked and disillusioned by events in the first six months of 2000. It is clear that major changes have to be made both to your lifestyle and to your investment strategy. You may resist change, but it is inevitable. The 31 July solar eclipse marks the end of one financial phase. Making the most of new opportunities requires that you develop new information sources. Put energy into this and check the integrity of all information. There is potential for real gains in the latter half of the year - especially if commodities are involved. November offers gains through overseas investment. Gemini 21 May - 20 June During the first few months of the year you are reminded of the need to consider making provision for care in your old age. This means reviewing pensions, insurance policies and healthcare cover. Tackle these issues before the solar eclipse of 1 July, which sees a fresh start in your financial affairs. Increased responsibility at work brings some cash reward by September. The extra income is swallowed up by a new investment programme recommended to you in late July. This new financial regime ensures that you conclude 2000 in a better state of financial health than you began it. Cancer 21 June - 22 July The solar eclipse of 5 February marks the end of a financial partnership. This is not bad news and heralds a new start. The planetary line-up for May brings cash-related fireworks that threaten to unsettle you. You find yourself undertaking major financial reconstruction in July. This could involve remortgaging or even a house move. During the summer you are advised to pay closer attention to long-term savings schemes. By early October you open yet another account. The solar eclipse of 25 December marks yet another financial gear change. This could be the start of more property or business investing. Leo 23 July - 22 August Keep a tight rein on your money during January if you want to avoid a financial crash of one kind or another in February or again late in May. The year is not all bad news, and financial gain is probable. An eclipse in your sign on 31 July heralds a new financial partnership. The two great wealth-giving planets, Jupiter and Pluto, could leave you walking a financial tightrope during the early autumn. You can limit high drama by listening to advice from your partner. Moderate your speculative tendencies and invest in well- established companies to ensure a safe ending to the year. Virgo 23 August - 22 September Finances receive a boost in February. But by March you find that the extra income is being eaten up by increased expenditure. Cost pruning is necessary in April. There are further shocks in the early part of May, but the last week of that month brings a reversal in your fortunes. You find yourself on the ground floor of a new business venture. Growth will be slow but sure. All your resources are stretched to the limits in September, but by mid-October you sense that rewards are on the way. Financial rewards reach you by early December and ensure a good ending to the year. Libra 23 September - 22 October Embarking on a financial fitness programme gets 2000 off to a good start for you. By the 5 February eclipse, you need to have a clear idea of your goals. This could require pruning costs in March and April. In May you are asked to consider a new financial partnership. Throughout June and July you make good gains. Budget for increased costs in August. Financial restructuring is again necessary in September. The reward is reduced tax liability. A money crisis in October finds you temporarily at odds with a partner. Investing in a new property is under discussion as the year closes. Scorpio 23 October - 22 November It may not be until 2001 that you are finally free of one financial obligation. But it seems less of a burden in 2000 than it has been. From February onward you are aware of improvements in your financial affairs. New developments in May find you seizing opportunities that others overlook. But these stretch your cashflow to the limit through to mid-October. A turning point is reached then. Others look to you to resolve a financial dilemma in November. This earns you more respect and could lead to a lucrative offer being made in early December. Sagittarius 22 November - 22 December Your financial fortunes could change dramatically in 2000. Facts and figures demand your attention from the first few days of the year. By February the ebb and flow of your bank account is changing pattern. Meetings with accountants and financial advisers take extra time that month. Extra work in May and June increases income. The extra cash could boost a pension. More income can be generated at the start of the next academic year, when others offer to pay you for demonstrating your skills. This second source of income develops quickly and could even change your tax status before the end of the year. Capricorn 23 December - 19 January The year 2000 promises to be one of steady growth for you. That does not mean it is boring. In February you decide to pull out of one financial partnership. This releases cash and energy for work in new areas. Your attention is drawn to overseas investments in April and May. Tax problems demand attention from late August. A financial adviser plays an important role in September. Christmas finds you considering a new financial partnership. During the last few days of the year you consider making a large investment. Once again your adviser plays a key role. Aquarius 20 January - 18 February The solar eclipses of 5 February and 31 July signal dramatic changes in your fortunes. View these as the endings of chapters. The new chapters beginning offer greater financial security. You could feel unsettled during the last few days of May, when others seek your long-term commitment to a new project. Once you have made appropriate adjustments, you find that your cashflow improves during late August and the early autumn. A review of your savings is necessary in early December. Realising a dream could be more expensive than you think. Depleting earlier gains may not be wise. Pisces 19 February - 20 March The financial affairs of those closest to you have a dramatic impact on your life this year. Six weeks into the start of the year you sense that you need to make your own needs known. By May you are ready for a new beginning and in June you find the commercial opportunity that has been eluding you for some time. A new product or business venture brings fast rewards during the summer, but there are difficulties from mid-October. Others run themselves short of capital. It may prove difficult to balance the books as the year draws to a close. Christeen Skinner is an astrologist who specialises in economic, social and political affairs",

      "body": "<p>The performance of our experts' share tips mirrored the stock market as a whole last year. The technology share chosen by Fleming Investment Management's Andrew Spencer, ARM Holdings, rose more than tenfold. However, those who picked companies which looked cheap on traditional valuation methods often found that their shares just got cheaper. The eclectic selection in The Observer's own portfolio was picked three years ago by secretaries throwing darts at the prices page of the Financial Times in an experiment to test whether successful investment owed more to luck than judgment. It includes a tea and coffee importer and the owner of the Hilton hotels. The experts won easily.

Even without the spectacular ARM, the professionals would have scored a 32 per cent rise. The darts portfolio does not look too bad over a year: up 22 per cent. But it failed to show that, over the long term, random selections can do as well as carefully researched ones. Anyone who put \u00a31,000 into each share in December 1996 would now have just \u00a37,700, having completely missed the stock market surge.</p> <p>Verdict on the experts For the professional investors, ARM Holdings was the runaway winner in 1999. Andrew Spencer of Fleming Investment Management chose the company because of the prospects for growth in microprocessors for computers and mobile phones, but even he must be surprised at how quickly the technology - and ARM's share price - have taken off. Even after a four-for-one split the shares stand at more than \u00a330, and each new deal - Intel and Microsoft are among its partners - pushed them higher. The runner-up was David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial, who chose Computacenter. Floated in 1998, its shares have more than doubled as investors chased technology growth. In any normal year, a 136 per cent rise would have been enough to take the top slot, but Peter Knapton of Legal &amp; General, manages only third place with his selection of Marconi, as GEC is now called. Knapton's prediction that the new team of Lord Simpson, managing director, and finance director John Mayo would transform the group was borne out when it took the dramatic step of selling its defence business to British Aerospace. The remaining telecoms equipment business has been strengthened by acquisitions, and the shares have been comprehensively rerated. Two of the experts' choices could have become one as Airtours, picked by Kate Murphy of Henderson Investors, bid for First Choice, the selection of M &amp; G's John Hatherly. Both rose strongly in the first six months, lifted by the bid and by the realisation that Britain was not plunging into recession, only to drop back sharply as the European Commission blocked the deal and travel firms overestimated demand for millennium holidays. First Choice, buoyed by continued bid speculation, recovered while Airtours dropped. Waste management group Shanks, put Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management into fifth place, with a 10 per cent rise. The market has still to be convinced that it is worth McLean's target of 350p. In seventh place is Nick Mustoe of Prudential who chose Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Despite respectable results the market refuses to see value in the shares. He just pipped Graham Wood of Standard Life who also found himself out of step with the market as Stagecoach dropped nearly 39 per cent. It did carry on making acquisitions, as Wood had predicted, and sales and profits rose, but that was not enough to calm market jitters.</p> <p>...and how the darts fared STAR of the darts portfolio was Aberdeen Asian Smaller Companies investment trust, where a recovery in the tiger economies helped its shares rise almost 80 per cent, although that puts it only just ahead of the 79p price when our secretaries' dart hit it. The next best was gas supplier International Energy Group, whose efforts at building its business continue to pay off. A 60 per cent rise during the year confirms it as the best performer over the three years of our experiment, in which time it has more than doubled in price. The 35 per cent rise in the shares of Capital Corporation was less exciting than it seems. The 85p price was the value of the offer from Stanley Leisure which finally put its shareholders out of their misery - when The Observer picked it, the price was 159p. Bid interest also played a part in the rise in shares of business travel group Hogg Robinson. UK Active Value, which targets underperforming companies, made a bid approach although, so far, there has been no other action. Midlands metal basher Ferrum Holdings had an eventful year. Dissident shareholders forced it to abandon an acquisition which it had hoped would transform the group, it had to fight off nominations to its board, and it returned to profit. Its shares did rise by 50 per cent although, at 3p, they are still firmly in the speculative camp. Intermediate Capital Group, which specialises in financing buy-outs and buy-ins, sought \u00a354 million in a rights issue to finance further expansion. Profits rose a healthy 14 per cent and the shares gained more than 8 per cent this year and almost two-thirds over the last three years. The portfolio had only two fallers this year, and both have dropped consistently since they were selected. Ladbroke renamed itself Hilton Group and formalised ties with its US counterpart. But it is still dogged by investors' belief that the hotel market is ripe for a recession, and its shares dropped by almost a fifth. Coffee and tea importer Langdons Foods was firmly in the doghouse. In a precarious financial position last year, it was rescued by Konrad Legg, who organised a \u00a31.35 million rights issue, consolidated its shares and changed its name to Coburg Group. Despite all that, the shares were still worth less than a quarter of their value at the start of the year. Having been trounced by the experts over three years, we have now decided to call a halt to the experiment.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Emily Bell<br>Business Editor</strong><br>On day two of the new millennium, the temptation is to advise everyone to avoid the stock market in the next 12 months because It Can't Go On. But forecasters who have stuck to this entirely rational line of reasoning for the past three years have missed one of the great bull runs this - sorry, last - century. Retreating from cowardice, a more canny approach is to tip one relatively safe stock and one more risky one. In the blue-chip corner we have Granada. The leisure services and media company will have a very active year. A high share value is attached to strength of management - Granada's top two, Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen, are exemplars. It will be looking to sort itself into a fit state for demerger, with a major leisure acquisition and at least one other major media acquisition or partnership. The shares, which underperformed in the last three months, should be a buy at their year-end level of 624p. Point a gun in a crowded room of dot.com initial public offerings, and you would hit the jackpot. That was the rule for 1999. Picking any technology stocks for 2000 is fraught with the knowledge that some will, again, see spectacular gains, but that many will fall to earth with a sickening thud. But a punter with surplus cash might do worse than look at Axon. This company does the dull bits of e-commerce, consulting on the implementation of the weightless economy. It doubled in value last year - only a modest gain for this sector. But as real companies need the nuts and bolts for e-business, firms such as Axon - current price, 592p - should prosper.</p> <p><strong>Heather Connon Investment Editor</strong> A series of profit warnings, a management in limbo and fears of the threat - not the opportunity - of the Internet meant that Reed Elsevier (465p) missed out on the boom in media stocks late last year. That will all change in 2000. New chief executive Crispin Davis made it clear in the December trading statement that Reed must catch up on the Internet boom and will spend freely to do so. More flesh will be put on that strategy in February, which should be the catalyst for a thorough rerating. Housebuilders had a brief flurry of excitement at the start of 1999 but reverted to a depressed state as interest rates rose. The depression is excessive: housebuilding shares are now discounting a bloodbath worse than that seen after the late Eighties boom. Yet there are no signs that the market is overheating, and interest rates are likely to peak at less than 8 per cent, just half the level they reached after the last boom. Many housebuilders look attractive, and McCarthy &amp; Stone, which specialises in sheltered housing for older people, is more so than most. Its shares, at 247p, stand at less than 10 times next year's expected earnings, earnings growth of at least 10 per cent is expected in the next three years and its big land bank is relatively cheap.</p> <p><strong>Paul Farrelly City Editor</strong> Diageo, the world's largest spirits firm created from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, was one of the FTSE-100 index's biggest disappointments in 1999. Its shares defied pundits' predictions of a rally by plumbing new depths from the spring onwards. Fears of overstocking for the millennium, particularly in Diageo's key US market, have done much of the damage. Analysts' profit downgrades, however, have been modest and Diageo's focus on shareholder value may yet see a demerger of Pillsbury, Burger King or even brewing. We are in good company in rating Diageo, now hovering around \u00a35, as a recovery buy. In the banking sector, Alliance &amp; Leicester has been through turbulent times. And there will be fun and games in the new year if ousted chief executive Peter White washes its dirty linen before an industrial tribunal. At \u00a38 now, A&amp;L shares have lost all the bid premium at the time of White's removal. The former building society is up for sale, however, and is certainly a buy. Our favourite, though, is one of banking's jewels, Abbey National, which - at below \u00a310 - has lost more than 40 per cent of its value since May. The bidding frenzy for NatWest aside, Abbey is one of the sector's great prizes. <strong>Ben Laurance Contributing Editor</strong> Engineering shares have taken a battering over the past two years, but started to recover recently. At current levels they continue to offer good value, measured by likely earnings and yield. If you are looking for a company which is sensibly managed with a good spread of businesses and which could benefit if the value of sterling falls, go for TI Group. At 460p, the shares represent secure value which should hold up reasonably well if the price of more fashionable stocks tumble. The takeover of Asda by Wal-Mart had a major impact on retail share valuations in the latter half of last year. The market was panicked into believing that profit margins across the sector were about to be slashed. If you believe these fears are overdone, look at Boots. The shares topped \u00a310.50 in the second half of 1998. That was unjustifiably high. But at around 600p now, the price has fallen too far. Watch out for Boots' trading statement this month. That should underpin the prediction that profits will hold up far better than the current share price reflects. Unless you believe that the established retail industry is about to collapse, Boot shares offer little downside and plenty of scope for appreciation.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Morgan Industrial Correspondent</strong> If you think the market's on the verge of another crash, there's nothing as defensive as utilities. Scottish &amp; Southern is viewed by many as the pick of the sector. With the shares at 493p now, the City is looking for an end year target of 730p. Attractions include: further cost cutting, possible growth of Scottish Hydro's 25 per cent and 6 per cent market shares in Scotland, and England and Wales respectively and sales opportunities from Southern Electricity's 2.5m customer base. S&amp;S's management is highly regarded and well up to coping with the relatively benign review meted out by regulator Callum McCarthy. For a more bullish growth stock, try Marconi, the renamed GEC. The telecoms equipment group's shares may have surged 80 per cent recently to 1094p now, but it still offers a chance of further gains from the fad for technology without the volatility of a dot.com company.</p> <p> And what do the professionals predict this time? For the experts, new technology and the Internet are a common theme - so much so that David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial has even managed to cite it in choosing one of our most traditional companies, Great Universal Stores (343p). Manning believes the Net will revolutionise business but he is deterred by the high valuations of the new technology stocks. Instead, he plumps for mail order giant Gus which 'already has the skillset and structure to reap great benefits from the e-commerce revolution'. He admits that the task of turning it around is great, but says its mail order business is already adept at sorting and distributing goods, and its Experian information division is the world's largest credit assessor. Graham Wood of Standard Life also looks for a technology stock going cheap, and alights on Cable &amp; Wireless (1047p), one of the few telecoms operators not to go through the roof last year. Wood believes 2000 could be different. He thinks it will sell its Hong Kong Telecom stake, focusing attention on the low valuation of the remainder, and thinks it could be a bid target. Andrew Spencer, of Fleming Investment Management, who ran away with the prize last year with his choice of ARM Holdings, is sticking with the winning formula of technology stocks. This time, he plumps for Autonomy ($48.70), a British company quoted on Easdaq, the European high-tech market. Floated only six months ago, its knowledge management software is aimed at saving time and money by analysing documents and picking out the most important facts. Autonomy's shares have already risen almost twentyfold since its debut. Kate Murphy of Henderson Investors and John Hatherly of M &amp; G both chose travel companies last year, and this year they both plump for biotech firms. Murphy's choice is Phytopharm (435p), a leader in producing cures for serious diseases using botanicals, or extracts from medicinal plants. Murphy believes it will produce remedies for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, eczema and hepatitis in coming years, in partnership with pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer. Hatherly opts for Celltech Chiroscience (529p), the newly-merged biotechnology company. Hatherly believes the fashion for high-tech companies will spill over into the biotech sector, and thinks Celltech's combination of 'a string portfolio of products, strong management and a well-financed business' will make it a winner. Max Ward, who retires as head of the UK desk at Baillie Gifford in April, chooses as his valedictory share Bovis, the housebuilder (308p). He expects its performance to be dull in the first half of the year but, as it becomes clear that interest rates will not have to rise to usurious levels, profits will rise faster than expected and shares could enjoy a dramatic re-rating. Jim Wood-Smith of broker Greig Middleton is in the unusual position of not now knowing whether his selection will by March have more than doubled its size. He opts for Bank of Scotland (719p), which is bidding \u00a325 billion for NatWest in competition with its Scottish neighbour, Royal Bank of Scotland. Wood-Smith thinks that, if it wins at that price, the deal will be very good for BoS shareholders. And if it loses, it can go back to being a very good bank - or an attractive takeover target for someone else. Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management plumps for Cordiant Communications, the advertising group (291p), which he thinks is benefiting from a pick-up in advertising activity. A large portion of money raised by new Internet companies in the US has been spent on awareness advertising.

      "bodyText": "Emily Bell Business Editor On day two of the new millennium, the temptation is to advise everyone to avoid the stock market in the next 12 months because It Can't Go On. But forecasters who have stuck to this entirely rational line of reasoning for the past three years have missed one of the great bull runs this - sorry, last - century. Retreating from cowardice, a more canny approach is to tip one relatively safe stock and one more risky one. In the blue-chip corner we have Granada. The leisure services and media company will have a very active year. A high share value is attached to strength of management - Granada's top two, Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen, are exemplars. It will be looking to sort itself into a fit state for demerger, with a major leisure acquisition and at least one other major media acquisition or partnership. The shares, which underperformed in the last three months, should be a buy at their year-end level of 624p. Point a gun in a crowded room of dot.com initial public offerings, and you would hit the jackpot. That was the rule for 1999. Picking any technology stocks for 2000 is fraught with the knowledge that some will, again, see spectacular gains, but that many will fall to earth with a sickening thud. But a punter with surplus cash might do worse than look at Axon. This company does the dull bits of e-commerce, consulting on the implementation of the weightless economy. It doubled in value last year - only a modest gain for this sector. But as real companies need the nuts and bolts for e-business, firms such as Axon - current price, 592p - should prosper. Heather Connon Investment Editor A series of profit warnings, a management in limbo and fears of the threat - not the opportunity - of the Internet meant that Reed Elsevier (465p) missed out on the boom in media stocks late last year. That will all change in 2000. New chief executive Crispin Davis made it clear in the December trading statement that Reed must catch up on the Internet boom and will spend freely to do so. More flesh will be put on that strategy in February, which should be the catalyst for a thorough rerating. Housebuilders had a brief flurry of excitement at the start of 1999 but reverted to a depressed state as interest rates rose. The depression is excessive: housebuilding shares are now discounting a bloodbath worse than that seen after the late Eighties boom. Yet there are no signs that the market is overheating, and interest rates are likely to peak at less than 8 per cent, just half the level they reached after the last boom. Many housebuilders look attractive, and McCarthy &amp; Stone, which specialises in sheltered housing for older people, is more so than most. Its shares, at 247p, stand at less than 10 times next year's expected earnings, earnings growth of at least 10 per cent is expected in the next three years and its big land bank is relatively cheap. Paul Farrelly City Editor Diageo, the world's largest spirits firm created from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, was one of the FTSE-100 index's biggest disappointments in 1999. Its shares defied pundits' predictions of a rally by plumbing new depths from the spring onwards. Fears of overstocking for the millennium, particularly in Diageo's key US market, have done much of the damage. Analysts' profit downgrades, however, have been modest and Diageo's focus on shareholder value may yet see a demerger of Pillsbury, Burger King or even brewing. We are in good company in rating Diageo, now hovering around \u00a35, as a recovery buy. In the banking sector, Alliance &amp; Leicester has been through turbulent times. And there will be fun and games in the new year if ousted chief executive Peter White washes its dirty linen before an industrial tribunal. At \u00a38 now, A&amp;L shares have lost all the bid premium at the time of White's removal. The former building society is up for sale, however, and is certainly a buy. Our favourite, though, is one of banking's jewels, Abbey National, which - at below \u00a310 - has lost more than 40 per cent of its value since May. The bidding frenzy for NatWest aside, Abbey is one of the sector's great prizes. Ben Laurance Contributing Editor Engineering shares have taken a battering over the past two years, but started to recover recently. At current levels they continue to offer good value, measured by likely earnings and yield. If you are looking for a company which is sensibly managed with a good spread of businesses and which could benefit if the value of sterling falls, go for TI Group. At 460p, the shares represent secure value which should hold up reasonably well if the price of more fashionable stocks tumble. The takeover of Asda by Wal-Mart had a major impact on retail share valuations in the latter half of last year. The market was panicked into believing that profit margins across the sector were about to be slashed. If you believe these fears are overdone, look at Boots. The shares topped \u00a310.50 in the second half of 1998. That was unjustifiably high. But at around 600p now, the price has fallen too far. Watch out for Boots' trading statement this month. That should underpin the prediction that profits will hold up far better than the current share price reflects. Unless you believe that the established retail industry is about to collapse, Boot shares offer little downside and plenty of scope for appreciation. Oliver Morgan Industrial Correspondent If you think the market's on the verge of another crash, there's nothing as defensive as utilities. Scottish &amp; Southern is viewed by many as the pick of the sector. With the shares at 493p now, the City is looking for an end year target of 730p. Attractions include: further cost cutting, possible growth of Scottish Hydro's 25 per cent and 6 per cent market shares in Scotland, and England and Wales respectively and sales opportunities from Southern Electricity's 2.5m customer base. S&amp;S's management is highly regarded and well up to coping with the relatively benign review meted out by regulator Callum McCarthy. For a more bullish growth stock, try Marconi, the renamed GEC. The telecoms equipment group's shares may have surged 80 per cent recently to 1094p now, but it still offers a chance of further gains from the fad for technology without the volatility of a dot.com company. And what do the professionals predict this time? For the experts, new technology and the Internet are a common theme - so much so that David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial has even managed to cite it in choosing one of our most traditional companies, Great Universal Stores (343p). Manning believes the Net will revolutionise business but he is deterred by the high valuations of the new technology stocks. Instead, he plumps for mail order giant Gus which 'already has the skillset and structure to reap great benefits from the e-commerce revolution'. He admits that the task of turning it around is great, but says its mail order business is already adept at sorting and distributing goods, and its Experian information division is the world's largest credit assessor. Graham Wood of Standard Life also looks for a technology stock going cheap, and alights on Cable &amp; Wireless (1047p), one of the few telecoms operators not to go through the roof last year. Wood believes 2000 could be different. He thinks it will sell its Hong Kong Telecom stake, focusing attention on the low valuation of the remainder, and thinks it could be a bid target. Andrew Spencer, of Fleming Investment Management, who ran away with the prize last year with his choice of ARM Holdings, is sticking with the winning formula of technology stocks. This time, he plumps for Autonomy ($48.70), a British company quoted on Easdaq, the European high-tech market. Floated only six months ago, its knowledge management software is aimed at saving time and money by analysing documents and picking out the most important facts. Autonomy's shares have already risen almost twentyfold since its debut. Kate Murphy of Henderson Investors and John Hatherly of M &amp; G both chose travel companies last year, and this year they both plump for biotech firms. Murphy's choice is Phytopharm (435p), a leader in producing cures for serious diseases using botanicals, or extracts from medicinal plants. Murphy believes it will produce remedies for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, eczema and hepatitis in coming years, in partnership with pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer. Hatherly opts for Celltech Chiroscience (529p), the newly-merged biotechnology company. Hatherly believes the fashion for high-tech companies will spill over into the biotech sector, and thinks Celltech's combination of 'a string portfolio of products, strong management and a well-financed business' will make it a winner. Max Ward, who retires as head of the UK desk at Baillie Gifford in April, chooses as his valedictory share Bovis, the housebuilder (308p). He expects its performance to be dull in the first half of the year but, as it becomes clear that interest rates will not have to rise to usurious levels, profits will rise faster than expected and shares could enjoy a dramatic re-rating. Jim Wood-Smith of broker Greig Middleton is in the unusual position of not now knowing whether his selection will by March have more than doubled its size. He opts for Bank of Scotland (719p), which is bidding \u00a325 billion for NatWest in competition with its Scottish neighbour, Royal Bank of Scotland. Wood-Smith thinks that, if it wins at that price, the deal will be very good for BoS shareholders. And if it loses, it can go back to being a very good bank - or an attractive takeover target for someone else. Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management plumps for Cordiant Communications, the advertising group (291p), which he thinks is benefiting from a pick-up in advertising activity. A large portion of money raised by new Internet companies in the US has been spent on awareness advertising. Europe is now joining that trend and Cordiant is in a prime position to reap rewards.",

But the degree to which the gap between climbers and fallers has opened up over the past 12 months is unprecedented.</p> <p>A handful of stock market stars saw their prices soar, but the share prices of most companies actually went down. Amid all the gleeful reporting of stock market records over the past few weeks, this elementary fact is worth repeating and holding on to: for virtually all of 1999, the majority of share prices were lower than they had been at the start of the year.</p> <p>But the sheer scale of the increase in prices of those shares that rose was enormous - so enormous that the indices of stock market prices as a whole were hauled upwards. The figures for the three best-performing sectors are staggering: between the end of 1998 and 21 December 1999, the value of the IT hardware sector rose by 654 per cent. Over the same period, the rise in information technology stocks was 184 per cent; software and computer services increased 144 per cent. Three further sectors - steel and metals, mining, and electronic and electrical equipment - managed increases of 100 per cent or more. </p> <p>But at the other end of the scale, tobacco and water companies fell by more than a third. Food producers, electricity companies and household products were all down by a fifth or more. Analysis by Legal &amp; General showed dramatically how the spread of price performances has been stretched over 1999. Look at all companies worth more than \u00a32 billion at the beginning of December 1999. Then plot how their prices have moved since the start of that year. In this league table, the top quarter of shares rose 28 per cent or more; the bottom quarter fell 33 per cent or more. So the spread between these two landmarks - the least successful winners and the most successful losers - was 61 per cent. Compare that with 1998: the figure then was a more modest 42 per cent; in 1994, it was just 21 per cent.</p> <p>The league table for the share price performances of individual FTSE 100 constituents reflects perfectly the pattern of the year: at the top are companies such as ARM Holdings, Sage Group and Colt Telecom. (ARM's value multiplied twelvefold between 1 January and 22 December. On Christmas Eve alone, it went up by more than \u00a33 to \u00a340.50 and as soon as the markets reopened after Christmas, it jumped a further 114p.) At the bottom are the likes of Boots, Great Universal Stores, Rentokil and Associated British Foods. </p> <p>Does this give any clues about investment strategy in 2000? Very little. No one knows when the technology bubble will burst. But just as the stellar performance of a few stocks lifted market indices in 1999, indices could fall in 2000 but leave share prices of more stolid companies unscathed. In a crash, it may be only a minority of stock prices that suffer. Investing in companies that have been eclipsed over the past 12 months might appear rather clever.</p>",

Amid all the gleeful reporting of stock market records over the past few weeks, this elementary fact is worth repeating and holding on to: for virtually all of 1999, the majority of share prices were lower than they had been at the start of the year. But the sheer scale of the increase in prices of those shares that rose was enormous - so enormous that the indices of stock market prices as a whole were hauled upwards. The figures for the three best-performing sectors are staggering: between the end of 1998 and 21 December 1999, the value of the IT hardware sector rose by 654 per cent. Over the same period, the rise in information technology stocks was 184 per cent; software and computer services increased 144 per cent. Three further sectors - steel and metals, mining, and electronic and electrical equipment - managed increases of 100 per cent or more. But at the other end of the scale, tobacco and water companies fell by more than a third. Food producers, electricity companies and household products were all down by a fifth or more. Analysis by Legal &amp; General showed dramatically how the spread of price performances has been stretched over 1999. Look at all companies worth more than \u00a32 billion at the beginning of December 1999. Then plot how their prices have moved since the start of that year. In this league table, the top quarter of shares rose 28 per cent or more; the bottom quarter fell 33 per cent or more. So the spread between these two landmarks - the least successful winners and the most successful losers - was 61 per cent. Compare that with 1998: the figure then was a more modest 42 per cent; in 1994, it was just 21 per cent. The league table for the share price performances of individual FTSE 100 constituents reflects perfectly the pattern of the year: at the top are companies such as ARM Holdings, Sage Group and Colt Telecom. (ARM's value multiplied twelvefold between 1 January and 22 December. On Christmas Eve alone, it went up by more than \u00a33 to \u00a340.50 and as soon as the markets reopened after Christmas, it jumped a further 114p.) At the bottom are the likes of Boots, Great Universal Stores, Rentokil and Associated British Foods. Does this give any clues about investment strategy in 2000? Very little. No one knows when the technology bubble will burst. But just as the stellar performance of a few stocks lifted market indices in 1999, indices could fall in 2000 but leave share prices of more stolid companies unscathed. In a crash, it may be only a minority of stock prices that suffer. Investing in companies that have been eclipsed over the past 12 months might appear rather clever.",
