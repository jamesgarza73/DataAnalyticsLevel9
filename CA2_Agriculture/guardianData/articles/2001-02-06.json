Barak had offered Palestinians a state encompassing most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, together with a share of the contested city.</p> <p>Palestinians had said beforehand they would work with whomever Israel elected, and repeated that after the exit polls were released.</p> <p>\"We respect the Israeli people's choice and we hope the peace process will continue,\" Nabil Abourdeneh, a top aide to Yasser Arafat, quoted the Palestinian leader as saying. However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned that Sharon's hardline views were a \"recipe for war.\" For many Israelis, neither candidate was a satisfactory choice - and the depth of that frustration was driven home by what election officials called a historically low turnout, 62 percent. Traditionally, Israel's voting average is close to 80 percent, among the democratic world's highest.</p> <p>Israeli Arabs, who account for 12.5 percent of the electorate and were a key source of support for Barak in 1999 elections, stayed home in droves.

He had hoped to the end for a turnabout. \"We're busy winning!\" he told supporters in Tel Aviv as evening fell.</p> <p>Israel clamped an election-day closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have already been under tight travel restrictions since the start of ferocious clashes that are now in their fifth month.</p> <p>Palestinians declared a \"day of rage\" to coincide with the Israeli voting. Dozens of Palestinians were hurt in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, Palestinians said.</p> <p>For many Israelis, the driving force behind the choice was a sense of insecurity spawned by months of fighting. Although the great majority of the nearly 400 people killed have been Palestinians, Israelis have been badly rattled by bombings, drive-by shootings, abductions and ambushes that are seen as making increasing inroads into daily life.</p> <p>And many Israelis simply could not stomach the fact that the outbreak of violence came on the heels of the most sweeping concessions offered the Palestinians by any Israeli leader: a state in 95 percent of the West Bank and virtually all of Gaza, and control of Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital.</p> <p>During the brief campaign - begun after Barak resigned eight weeks ago - the prime minister warned again and again that Sharon could plunge Israel into all-out war with the Palestinians, or even ignite a regional conflagration.</p> <p>Sharon countered by saying that calm must be restored before any meaningful dialogue could occur, and that Barak's proffered concessions on territory and Jerusalem went too far.</p> <p>For the first time in Israel's history, voters were choosing only a prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Ariel Sharon has secured a projected landslide win over Ehud Barak, the prime minister whose peace hopes were dashed by some of the worst Israeli-Palestinian bloodletting in decades. Exit polls commissioned by Israel's two main TV channels both projected a Sharon win by an overwhelming margin of 59.5 percent to 40.5 percent - about the same margin predicted in public opinion polls in the days and weeks before the vote. Jubilation broke out at Sharon's headquarters in Tel Aviv, with supporters jumping and dancing with joy, waving Israeli flags as they awaited his triumphant arrival. \"The end of Oslo!\" some shouted, referring to the interim peace accord that Sharon had always opposed. Barak supporters were plunged into gloom. \"It's a disaster for Israeli democracy and the Israeli people, because they totally want something Sharon is unable to deliver,\" said parliament member Yael Dayan. At Barak headquarters, a few downcast young campaigners softly sang a line from the national anthem: \"We have not yet given up hope.\" Charting a new road map for Mideast peacemaking, Israelis appeared to have picked Sharon - a veteran hawk who refuses to cede the Palestinians more territory or a foothold in Jerusalem - over Barak, who offered Palestinians a state encompassing most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, together with a share of the contested city. Sharon says he does want to negotiate peace - but only after calm has been restored. For many Israelis, neither candidate was a satisfactory choice - and the depth of that frustration was driven home by what election officials called a historically low turnout, just over 60 percent. Traditionally, Israel's voting average is close to 80 percent, among the democratic world's highest. Israeli Arabs, who were a key source of support for Barak in 1999 elections, stayed home in droves, dealing a final blow to the prime minister's already slim chances for pulling out a last-minute victory. The 72-year-old Sharon, whose admirers regard him as a war hero and whose detractors fear him as a reckless military adventurist, had been overwhelmingly favored in pre-election opinion polls. But Barak, forced into early elections after 19 turbulent months at the helm of an ever-fraying governing coalition, had hoped to the end for a turnabout. \"We're busy winning!\" he told supporters in Tel Aviv as night fell. Israel clamped an election-day closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have already been under tight travel restrictions since the start of ferocious clashes that are now in their fifth month. Palestinians declared a \"day of rage\" to coincide with the Israeli voting, but the violence - by recent standards - was relatively muted. At least 43 Palestinians were hurt in clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank. For many Israelis, the driving force behind the choice was a sense of insecurity spawned by months of fighting. Although the great majority of the nearly 400 people killed have been Palestinians, Israelis have been badly rattled by bombings, drive-by shootings, abductions and ambushes that are seen as making increasing inroads into daily life. And many Israelis simply could not stomach the fact that the outbreak of violence came on the heels of the most sweeping concessions offered the Palestinians by any Israeli leader: a state in 95 percent of the West Bank and virtually all of Gaza, and control of Arab neighborhoods of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their capital. In the course of the short campaign - triggered when Barak resigned eight weeks ago - the prime minister warned again and again that Sharon could plunge Israel into all-out war with the Palestinians, or even ignite a regional conflagration. But Sharon countered by saying that calm must be restored before any meaningful dialogue can occur, and that Barak's proffered concessions on territory and Jerusalem went too far. \"To those who want security for the citizens of Israel - I will bring it,\" he told supporters Tuesday in the northern town of Kiryat Shemona, on the Lebanese border. For the first time in Israel's history, voters were choosing only a prime minister, not a parliament. Because no lawmakers' seats were at stake, the winner in Tuesday's ballot inherits the same sharply divided Knesset, or parliament. Many analysts predicted it would be just as difficult for Sharon to form a stable government as it has been for Barak - and that his term in office could be even shorter. Sharon has said - and repeated Tuesday - that he wanted a broad-based coalition that could embrace Barak's Labor Party. It was not clear whether such an alliance could be forged, since Barak's and Sharon's positions on the Palestinians are so far apart. Officially, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority says it will work with any Israeli prime minister. But some of his top associates expressed deep misgivings. \"There's a lot of anger and bad memories among our people about Sharon,\" said top Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath. An Israeli commission found Sharon indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Beirut in 1982. In the West Bank town of Ramallah, demonstrators burned pictures of both Israeli candidates, but the harshest words were reserved for Sharon.

      "body": "<p>An Effective Protection Regime for the Twenty-first Century </p> <p>Speech to IPPR, 6 February 2001</p> <p>By the Home Secretary, Rt Hon Jack Straw MP</p> <p>1.Ten days ago, I sat in Westminster Central Hall with the Prime Minister, the Prince of Wales and hundreds of others to mark the first UK Holocaust Memorial Day. On the fifty-sixth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, it gave us cause to remember Europe's efforts in the war's aftermath to make sure that such suffering never took place again.</p> <p>2.Those post-war efforts culminated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including a right to seek political asylum. The 1951 UN Convention on Refugees gave that right legal statement.</p> <p>3.In this, the Convention's fiftieth anniversary year, we celebrate the right to asylum. The UK has a proud history of offering shelter to those fleeing persecution. We, the whole of the EU, USA and Canada, and many other countries around the world, are committed to maintaining that tradition and to meeting our obligations under the Convention.</p> <p>4.Yet the Convention is no longer working as its framers intended.</p> <p>5.The environment in which it is applied today is one that has changed almost out of all recognition from that of 1951. Numbers of asylum seekers have vastly increased.</p> <p>6.As a result, the current system is failing many refugees, while at the same time putting huge pressure on receiving nations - not just Western states, but also developing countries which host large numbers of the world's displaced persons.</p> <p>7.The time has therefore come for the Convention's signatories to re-examine its operation, with a view to making it work as it was intended - to relieve the suffering of genuine refugees.</p> <p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>8.The Convention was designed for an era when international flows of people were on a much smaller scale than they are today. Intercontinental travel was rare, difficult and expensive.</p> <p>9.Fifty years on, the world has been transformed. New technology, global communications and cheap international travel have all contributed to a world where rapid, long-distance migration is a realistic option - and a widespread aspiration.</p> <p>10.This is creating new pressures on every part of our immigration system - not least that part which deals with claims for asylum. In particular, thousands of would-be migrants are taking advantage of one aspect of the Convention - namely, that it places an obligation on States to consider any application for asylum made on their territory, however ill-founded.</p> <p>11.The statistics speak for themselves. Whilst the potential for large-scale economic migration has expanded, so too the number of people affected by political upheaval has risen. Civil war and internal oppression continue to make conditions difficult in many countries. As a consequence, the number of displaced persons has increased massively.</p> <p>12. Up until 1988, the UK received around 4,000 asylum applications a year. With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the Iron Curtain, the imploding of the economies of Eastern Europe, and civil and cross border wars in the Balkans, Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and elsewhere, numbers rose ten fold in the space of three years. However, investment in staff and IT in the Home Office lagged badly behind this surge for a decade. In 2000, 76,000 applications were made and the majority of initial decisions taken during the year resulted in refusals of both asylum and exceptional leave. About 80% of appeals are unsuccessful. Other EU countries have also seen large increases in asylum applicants, many of whom do not qualify for any form of protection. Despite our increases, we remain 7th in the per capita league table.</p> <p>13. And, since the Convention places no obligation on states to facilitate access to their territory for those in need of protection, many well founded refugees as well as those with no serious claim resort to people-smuggling and other methods of illegal entry in order to access the protection that they need. </p> <p>14. Taken together, these two trends - of increasing economic migration, and increasing numbers of displaced persons - mean that we are faced with a situation where too much effort and resources are being expended on dealing with unfounded claims for asylum, and not enough on helping those in need of protection.</p> <p><strong>A way forward?</strong></p> <p>15. So how can we make the international protection regime work better?</p> <p>16. First, let me repeat that the UK - and all other signatory States - must meet their basic obligations under the 1951 Convention. That obviously includes giving sanctuary to Convention refugees who arrive at our shores.</p> <p>17. But our obligations go beyond that.</p> <p>18. Refugees have a right to expect that their claims will be assessed quickly and fairly; and that they will be integrated into our society.</p> <p>19. But refugees and the public also have a right to expect that there will be a quick and effective process in place for identifying those who make unfounded claims for asylum.</p> <p>20. We have achieved a good deal in the last 12 months in striving to reach these goals. The backlog is down. Decisions are up. Applications are being processed more swiftly. We are taking positive action to help recognised refugees feel that they belong in their new home. All of us I hope recognise and appreciate the contribution which many refugees are making to our society, through their work and their culture.</p> <p>21. We have worked hard to improve on our domestic processes over the last three and a half years. But we have also helped to lead a much more active European Union wide agenda, for what is a shared European problem. At the European Union Heads of State meeting in Tampere in 1999, the Member States committed themselves to building a Common European Asylum System.</p> <p>22. The UK is at the forefront in driving forward European action in this area. Later this week, Barbara Roche and I will be in Stockholm for the informal meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers. We will be focussing on asylum and on combating people smuggling and trafficking. I will use the meeting to call for real results by the end of this year on some of the key measures which will set up a Common European Asylum System - on asylum procedures, reception conditions for asylum seekers, and the replacement of the Dublin Convention.</p> <p>23. We will also emphasise the importance of tackling people smuggling and trafficking particularly through the Western Balkans. The Prime Minister and the Italian Prime Minister (Amato) wrote jointly in the Observer and Corriera della Sera this weekend of the need for strong action against traffickers. Our EU partners are fully signed up to working with us to combat trafficking through the Western Balkans. We expect most of them to attend a planning meeting we are hosting in London next Monday.</p> <p>24. And on Friday, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and I will be meeting our French opposite numbers in Cahors in France at the Franco-British Summit. We will use this meeting to press the case for enhanced co-operation between us to combat the problem of illegal immigration from France to the UK, including problems associated with the Eurostar service.</p> <p>25. All this shows how we are working actively with our European partners to find solutions to the challenges we face.</p> <p>26. Important however as our domestic procedures are and important as consistent standards in EU Member States are, they are not enough by themselves to resolve the difficulties we face. To do that we need to take a step back and look at the wider picture.</p> <p>27. That is what I began to do in my speech in Lisbon last June, when I set out some ideas for creating a more rational and effective protection regime. Today I want to develop my thinking a little further.</p> <p>28. It seems to me that the international community must, collectively, do at least three things better than it is doing now:</p> <p>29. First, we must help the countries concerned to make conditions in the regions of origin better;</p> <p>30. Second, we must make it easier for genuine refugees to access the protection regimes of Europe and other Western States, for example by making their journeys less hazardous;</p> <p>31. Third, we must ensure that those who are not refugees are dissuaded from seeking to benefit unjustly from the terms of the 1951 Convention. </p> <p> 32. Let me take each of these briefly in turn.</p> <p><strong>Conditions in regions of origin</strong></p> <p>33. The great majority of the world's refugees are forced to live in areas neighbouring their homeland. It follows that the main focus of the international community's protection efforts should be on these areas. </p> <p> 34. Most refugees want nothing more than to return safely to their own country. They have the best chance of doing that if they are able to stay in safety and dignity in a place as close as possible to home, until such time as it is safe to go back.</p> <p>35. This was the principle behind the concerted EU effort to help refugees from the Kosovan conflict. The overwhelming majority of displaced people were looked after across the border in neighbouring Macedonia. Those in particularly need were given temporary protection in the UK and other EU member states as apart of the Kosovo Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Co-ordinated joint action between EU Member States, UNHCR and other agencies meant that many evacuees did not have to flee hundreds of miles to find safety. They were able to return home when it was safe for them to do so and did not have to get embroiled with the criminal traffickers.</p> <p>36. Yet current spending patterns do not seem to reflect the priority of protection in the regions. On one estimate, about $10 billion is spent annually by developed countries in assessing claims for refugee status, most of which are rejected. But those same countries give only $1 billion a year to UNHCR, the main provider of protection to the millions of displaced persons in the regions of origin.</p> <p>37. Money is not a panacea, and I am not saying that more money spent in these areas would provide a miracle cure. But I am saying that the balance of effort is wrong.</p> <p>38. The international community now needs to get together and consider what might be done to redress this imbalance. This is not something the UK can do alone. It is not even something which the EU can do by itself. Instead it requires both the funders and the funded to come together to discuss a way forward.</p> <p>39. Action in the regions of origin will reduce the pressure on refugees to travel further afield in search of protection.</p> <p>40. But I do not pretend that all such movement can be brought to an end. There remains the question of how refugees can reach safety in the developed world if help cannot be provided more locally. </p> <p><strong>Resettlement programme?</strong></p> <p>41. Some may say that the increased use of visas and the imposition of penalties on carriers is the main barrier preventing refugees from reaching safety, and that the answer is therefore to end these policies. I disagree.</p> <p>42. Remove measures such as these and we risk an unacceptable rise in uncontrolled economic migration of people seeking to gain entry by making unfounded asylum claims. That would put intolerable pressure on our assessment processes and risk bringing the Convention into dispute.</p> <p>43. Neither governments nor their publics within Europe and beyond would find this acceptable. We are all committed to the Convention and all wish to see it operate effectively. At the same time, we have a duty to operate immigration policies for the benefit of our communities.</p> <p>44. So we need other ideas - ideas which enable us to consider asylum claims in the region of origin.</p> <p>45. One option would be for the EU to set up a resettlement programme, under which an agreed number of refugees - and possibly others in need of protection - would be identified in their own regions and brought to the EU for resettlement. The European Commission has stated, in its November paper on a common EU asylum system, that it will be carrying out feasibility studies on such a programme. </p> <p>46. I can see potential advantages in such a scheme. The Humanitarian Evacuation Programme from Kosovo I referred to earlier showed how a proactive and co-ordinated EU response could help address a serious protection crisis. That Programme provided temporary protection and gives some useful pointers as to how other programmes for resettlement could contribute to a more orderly and effective international protection system.</p> <p>47. Equally, there are serious issues to consider such as the cost and scale of any programme, how those selected for resettlement would be allocated to individual Member States, and what the criteria for selection would be. In assessing this, the Commission can draw on the experiences of countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia. The UK will play a constructive part in the Commission's work.</p> <p>48. It will also be necessary for the EU to fit any procedures for assessing asylum claims overseas into the wider picture. We need to ensure that such external procedures are matched by domestic EU procedures which deal with unfounded asylum claims more speedily than is the case at present. We would also want to see more applications lodged from overseas leading to fewer claims being made within the EU. </p> <p>49. The aim of my speech in Lisbon was to highlight the inconsistencies and illogicalities in the current global system for the protection of refugees. The Commission Communication on Asylum rightly seeks to look at the asylum system as a whole. The UK will want to play a full part in the developing debate on all these ideas but it is clear that completing the reform of the domestic system will provide the essential platform from which more radical longer term ideas can be considered. Any moves towards the implementation of ideas for processing of claims overseas or substantial resettlement programmes will have to be in parallel with driving down the numbers of unfounded applications.</p> <p><strong>More effective domestic procedures for weak claims</strong></p> <p>50. This leads onto my third area: devising better ways of dealing with those who are not in need of protection but who seek to shelter under the umbrella of the Convention. </p> <p>51. In so doing, these individuals do great damage to asylum systems. They overload the elaborate procedures we have for assessing asylum claims. They cause vast quantities of money to be expended on assessing unfounded claims which might be better spent in the regions of origin. And they can turn the public against genuine refugees.</p> <p>52. There are two main ways of deterring misuse of this kind. The first is to process claims quickly. There is a range of measures which states can implement domestically to address this. However, there are collective measures which I believe could help.</p> <p>53. For example, an EU or internationally-agreed list of safe countries or groups from which asylum applications would be ruled inadmissible or considered under a greatly accelerated process. More generally, the EU's development of common asylum policies should reduce the attractions of so-called \"asylum shopping\".</p> <p>54. The second aspect of deterring unfounded claims is the prompt return of those found not to need protection. The integrity of any asylum process will be undermined if those who make unfounded claims are able to stay.</p> <p>55. I therefore make no apology in highlighting this as a fundamental issue for any protection regime. Everyone who is concerned about the need for international protection should be in favour of an effective system for returning those who do not have such a need. One aspect of this is that countries must document and accept back their nationals who do not qualify for protection elsewhere. We are already working with our European partners to conclude Community readmission agreements with third countries.</p> <p>56. EU States have their particular set of interests on protection issues. Other countries, many of whom provide shelter for the millions of displaced people, have their own set of interests, which might not all be the same as ours. But nor need they be incompatible - all countries have their part to play in meeting the burden of supporting refugees.</p> <p>57. We need to get together so that we can understand each other's perspectives, and move on from there to identifying collective actions which will deliver the effective protection system we all want. UNHCR's global consultations provide us with an excellent opportunity for such a debate.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>58. Most of us can agree that the international protection regime is not operating as well as it should. We need some radical thinking if we are to ensure that the principles of the 1951 Convention are to be applied effectively in the modern age.</p> <p>59. With the EU looking to move towards a common asylum system, and with UNHCR holding its global consultations exercise, now is the time to have that debate and to find solutions.</p> <p>60. Asylum is an international issue which requires an international response. And the UK is dedicated to playing its full part in trying to develop a better system of protection.</p>",

Civil war and internal oppression continue to make conditions difficult in many countries. As a consequence, the number of displaced persons has increased massively. 12. Up until 1988, the UK received around 4,000 asylum applications a year. With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the Iron Curtain, the imploding of the economies of Eastern Europe, and civil and cross border wars in the Balkans, Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and elsewhere, numbers rose ten fold in the space of three years. However, investment in staff and IT in the Home Office lagged badly behind this surge for a decade. In 2000, 76,000 applications were made and the majority of initial decisions taken during the year resulted in refusals of both asylum and exceptional leave. About 80% of appeals are unsuccessful. Other EU countries have also seen large increases in asylum applicants, many of whom do not qualify for any form of protection. Despite our increases, we remain 7th in the per capita league table. 13. And, since the Convention places no obligation on states to facilitate access to their territory for those in need of protection, many well founded refugees as well as those with no serious claim resort to people-smuggling and other methods of illegal entry in order to access the protection that they need. 14. Taken together, these two trends - of increasing economic migration, and increasing numbers of displaced persons - mean that we are faced with a situation where too much effort and resources are being expended on dealing with unfounded claims for asylum, and not enough on helping those in need of protection. A way forward? 15. So how can we make the international protection regime work better? 16. First, let me repeat that the UK - and all other signatory States - must meet their basic obligations under the 1951 Convention. That obviously includes giving sanctuary to Convention refugees who arrive at our shores. 17. But our obligations go beyond that. 18. Refugees have a right to expect that their claims will be assessed quickly and fairly; and that they will be integrated into our society. 19. But refugees and the public also have a right to expect that there will be a quick and effective process in place for identifying those who make unfounded claims for asylum. 20. We have achieved a good deal in the last 12 months in striving to reach these goals. The backlog is down. Decisions are up. Applications are being processed more swiftly. We are taking positive action to help recognised refugees feel that they belong in their new home. All of us I hope recognise and appreciate the contribution which many refugees are making to our society, through their work and their culture. 21. We have worked hard to improve on our domestic processes over the last three and a half years. But we have also helped to lead a much more active European Union wide agenda, for what is a shared European problem. At the European Union Heads of State meeting in Tampere in 1999, the Member States committed themselves to building a Common European Asylum System. 22. The UK is at the forefront in driving forward European action in this area. Later this week, Barbara Roche and I will be in Stockholm for the informal meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers. We will be focussing on asylum and on combating people smuggling and trafficking. I will use the meeting to call for real results by the end of this year on some of the key measures which will set up a Common European Asylum System - on asylum procedures, reception conditions for asylum seekers, and the replacement of the Dublin Convention. 23. We will also emphasise the importance of tackling people smuggling and trafficking particularly through the Western Balkans. The Prime Minister and the Italian Prime Minister (Amato) wrote jointly in the Observer and Corriera della Sera this weekend of the need for strong action against traffickers. Our EU partners are fully signed up to working with us to combat trafficking through the Western Balkans. We expect most of them to attend a planning meeting we are hosting in London next Monday. 24. And on Friday, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and I will be meeting our French opposite numbers in Cahors in France at the Franco-British Summit. We will use this meeting to press the case for enhanced co-operation between us to combat the problem of illegal immigration from France to the UK, including problems associated with the Eurostar service. 25. All this shows how we are working actively with our European partners to find solutions to the challenges we face. 26. Important however as our domestic procedures are and important as consistent standards in EU Member States are, they are not enough by themselves to resolve the difficulties we face. To do that we need to take a step back and look at the wider picture. 27. That is what I began to do in my speech in Lisbon last June, when I set out some ideas for creating a more rational and effective protection regime. Today I want to develop my thinking a little further. 28. It seems to me that the international community must, collectively, do at least three things better than it is doing now: 29. First, we must help the countries concerned to make conditions in the regions of origin better; 30. Second, we must make it easier for genuine refugees to access the protection regimes of Europe and other Western States, for example by making their journeys less hazardous; 31. Third, we must ensure that those who are not refugees are dissuaded from seeking to benefit unjustly from the terms of the 1951 Convention. 32. Let me take each of these briefly in turn. Conditions in regions of origin 33. The great majority of the world's refugees are forced to live in areas neighbouring their homeland. It follows that the main focus of the international community's protection efforts should be on these areas. 34. Most refugees want nothing more than to return safely to their own country. They have the best chance of doing that if they are able to stay in safety and dignity in a place as close as possible to home, until such time as it is safe to go back. 35. This was the principle behind the concerted EU effort to help refugees from the Kosovan conflict. The overwhelming majority of displaced people were looked after across the border in neighbouring Macedonia. Those in particularly need were given temporary protection in the UK and other EU member states as apart of the Kosovo Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Co-ordinated joint action between EU Member States, UNHCR and other agencies meant that many evacuees did not have to flee hundreds of miles to find safety. They were able to return home when it was safe for them to do so and did not have to get embroiled with the criminal traffickers. 36. Yet current spending patterns do not seem to reflect the priority of protection in the regions. On one estimate, about $10 billion is spent annually by developed countries in assessing claims for refugee status, most of which are rejected. But those same countries give only $1 billion a year to UNHCR, the main provider of protection to the millions of displaced persons in the regions of origin. 37. Money is not a panacea, and I am not saying that more money spent in these areas would provide a miracle cure. But I am saying that the balance of effort is wrong. 38. The international community now needs to get together and consider what might be done to redress this imbalance. This is not something the UK can do alone. It is not even something which the EU can do by itself. Instead it requires both the funders and the funded to come together to discuss a way forward. 39. Action in the regions of origin will reduce the pressure on refugees to travel further afield in search of protection. 40. But I do not pretend that all such movement can be brought to an end. There remains the question of how refugees can reach safety in the developed world if help cannot be provided more locally. Resettlement programme? 41. Some may say that the increased use of visas and the imposition of penalties on carriers is the main barrier preventing refugees from reaching safety, and that the answer is therefore to end these policies. I disagree. 42. Remove measures such as these and we risk an unacceptable rise in uncontrolled economic migration of people seeking to gain entry by making unfounded asylum claims. That would put intolerable pressure on our assessment processes and risk bringing the Convention into dispute. 43. Neither governments nor their publics within Europe and beyond would find this acceptable. We are all committed to the Convention and all wish to see it operate effectively. At the same time, we have a duty to operate immigration policies for the benefit of our communities. 44. So we need other ideas - ideas which enable us to consider asylum claims in the region of origin. 45. One option would be for the EU to set up a resettlement programme, under which an agreed number of refugees - and possibly others in need of protection - would be identified in their own regions and brought to the EU for resettlement. The European Commission has stated, in its November paper on a common EU asylum system, that it will be carrying out feasibility studies on such a programme. 46. I can see potential advantages in such a scheme. The Humanitarian Evacuation Programme from Kosovo I referred to earlier showed how a proactive and co-ordinated EU response could help address a serious protection crisis. That Programme provided temporary protection and gives some useful pointers as to how other programmes for resettlement could contribute to a more orderly and effective international protection system. 47. Equally, there are serious issues to consider such as the cost and scale of any programme, how those selected for resettlement would be allocated to individual Member States, and what the criteria for selection would be. In assessing this, the Commission can draw on the experiences of countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia. The UK will play a constructive part in the Commission's work. 48. It will also be necessary for the EU to fit any procedures for assessing asylum claims overseas into the wider picture. We need to ensure that such external procedures are matched by domestic EU procedures which deal with unfounded asylum claims more speedily than is the case at present. We would also want to see more applications lodged from overseas leading to fewer claims being made within the EU. 49. The aim of my speech in Lisbon was to highlight the inconsistencies and illogicalities in the current global system for the protection of refugees. The Commission Communication on Asylum rightly seeks to look at the asylum system as a whole. The UK will want to play a full part in the developing debate on all these ideas but it is clear that completing the reform of the domestic system will provide the essential platform from which more radical longer term ideas can be considered. Any moves towards the implementation of ideas for processing of claims overseas or substantial resettlement programmes will have to be in parallel with driving down the numbers of unfounded applications. More effective domestic procedures for weak claims 50. This leads onto my third area: devising better ways of dealing with those who are not in need of protection but who seek to shelter under the umbrella of the Convention. 51. In so doing, these individuals do great damage to asylum systems. They overload the elaborate procedures we have for assessing asylum claims. They cause vast quantities of money to be expended on assessing unfounded claims which might be better spent in the regions of origin. And they can turn the public against genuine refugees. 52. There are two main ways of deterring misuse of this kind. The first is to process claims quickly. There is a range of measures which states can implement domestically to address this. However, there are collective measures which I believe could help. 53. For example, an EU or internationally-agreed list of safe countries or groups from which asylum applications would be ruled inadmissible or considered under a greatly accelerated process. More generally, the EU's development of common asylum policies should reduce the attractions of so-called \"asylum shopping\". 54. The second aspect of deterring unfounded claims is the prompt return of those found not to need protection. The integrity of any asylum process will be undermined if those who make unfounded claims are able to stay. 55. I therefore make no apology in highlighting this as a fundamental issue for any protection regime. Everyone who is concerned about the need for international protection should be in favour of an effective system for returning those who do not have such a need. One aspect of this is that countries must document and accept back their nationals who do not qualify for protection elsewhere. We are already working with our European partners to conclude Community readmission agreements with third countries. 56. EU States have their particular set of interests on protection issues. Other countries, many of whom provide shelter for the millions of displaced people, have their own set of interests, which might not all be the same as ours. But nor need they be incompatible - all countries have their part to play in meeting the burden of supporting refugees. 57. We need to get together so that we can understand each other's perspectives, and move on from there to identifying collective actions which will deliver the effective protection system we all want. UNHCR's global consultations provide us with an excellent opportunity for such a debate. Conclusion 58. Most of us can agree that the international protection regime is not operating as well as it should. We need some radical thinking if we are to ensure that the principles of the 1951 Convention are to be applied effectively in the modern age. 59. With the EU looking to move towards a common asylum system, and with UNHCR holding its global consultations exercise, now is the time to have that debate and to find solutions. 60. Asylum is an international issue which requires an international response. And the UK is dedicated to playing its full part in trying to develop a better system of protection.",

After a long winter of floods and railway chaos, many Britons will feel citizens of the capital have got off pretty lightly with a mere 12 hours of standstill on the underground. All the same, when London grinds to a halt the economy of the entire country is affected, so the frustrations of the capital are not completely parochial.</p> <p>Who will those frustrations be directed towards? Who will drivers stuck on the M25 and commuters sardined into buses blame for their ordeal? And who will they curse when the rail unions strike again, on February 12 and 19?</p> <p>The most obvious target might seem to be the unions themselves. But many passengers dislike the planned partial privatisation of the tube just as much as the protesters: few will damn the strikers when they share their grievance.</p> <p>Perhaps Ken Livingstone will be next in line for blame: in any American city, it is the mayor who is first to feel the heat. But here too the usual rule does not quite apply. For most Londoners currently see the mayor as a champion on the same side as both commuters and the unions - pitted against a government bent on privatisation. For the moment that leaves Ken safe from attack. Few Londoners yesterday even demanded he work to ease the road congestion that inevitably comes when the tube shuts down - understanding, perhaps, that the mayor has all too little power to do anything.</p> <p>That leaves the government.

      "bodyText": "Londoners will not expect too much sympathy from their fellow Britons as they complain of their \"day of commuter hell\" yesterday. After a long winter of floods and railway chaos, many Britons will feel citizens of the capital have got off pretty lightly with a mere 12 hours of standstill on the underground. All the same, when London grinds to a halt the economy of the entire country is affected, so the frustrations of the capital are not completely parochial. Who will those frustrations be directed towards? Who will drivers stuck on the M25 and commuters sardined into buses blame for their ordeal? And who will they curse when the rail unions strike again, on February 12 and 19? The most obvious target might seem to be the unions themselves. But many passengers dislike the planned partial privatisation of the tube just as much as the protesters: few will damn the strikers when they share their grievance. Perhaps Ken Livingstone will be next in line for blame: in any American city, it is the mayor who is first to feel the heat. But here too the usual rule does not quite apply. For most Londoners currently see the mayor as a champion on the same side as both commuters and the unions - pitted against a government bent on privatisation. For the moment that leaves Ken safe from attack. Few Londoners yesterday even demanded he work to ease the road congestion that inevitably comes when the tube shuts down - understanding, perhaps, that the mayor has all too little power to do anything. That leaves the government. Despite John Prescott's admirable shift towards compromise on privatisation last week, it is Labour's policy which is still seen as the threat to the tube. As long as that continues, Mr Livingstone will be able to cast himself as solution rather than problem. But that cannot last forever: eventually Londoners will hold Ken responsible for what happens in the city - and blame him when things go wrong.

The proposals are likely to infuriate Oxbridge and lead to MPs being accused of unfair \"positive discrimination\". The report recommends getting rid of the separate application form which applicants to Oxford and Cambridge are required to fill in. \"Why should we signal in the 21st century that these universities should be different?\" one source supportive of the committee report said. The report warns Oxbridge: \"The college system should not be used as an excuse for inaction.\" Some MPs believe collegiate independence has enabled the universities to shirk their responsibilities to encourage more applications from state schools. The universities flatly reject the claim. The select committee began its controversial inquiry in the wake of the Laura Spence affair, when the chancellor, Gordon Brown, strongly criticised Magdalen College, Oxford, for refusing to select the state school student. Miss Spence was rejected before she got the results of her A-levels in which she was awarded five As. Barry Sheerman, chairman of the select committee, angered opposition MPs by refusing to allow specific reference to the Spence case. The majority report does not criticise Mr Brown - one of the main reasons why the two Tory members of the committee, Nick St Aubyn and Stephen O'Brien, have opposed it. Last week Oxford University released figures showing it had accepted 42.2% of applicants from state schools and 41.7% of those from private schools. Liberal Democrat Evan Harris, whose Oxford West and Abingdon seat includes the university, claimed this showed that it was leading the way on university access. But the select committee has taken more account of figures produced by the millionaire philanthropist Peter Lampl that showed that more than 1,000 students from poorer areas were not winning the places at top universities to which their grades entitled them. Mr Lampl, now an unpaid adviser to the HEFCE, supports delaying applications until results are known - as do the Local Government Association and the teaching unions. The committee heard from Gerard McCrum, a former don at Hertford College, Oxford, who said that many students who narrowly missed the grades they were required to achieve were often given places anyway. \"If someone has not missed their target by too much they will say, 'Don't worry about that, you can come up anyway...' It is a black art.\" Dr McCrum told the committee: \"The head of college and the admissions tutor usually do it themselves. \"It all has to be done very quickly within hours in the middle of the long vacation so the people who are there - and it is usually the admissions tutor and the head of the college - usually decide that.\"",

Sadly, last week's broadside from the protesting professors serves only to show that economists can be as economical with the actualit\u00e9 as any politician. It's easy to set up a caricature and knock it down, to ignore inconvenient facts, and to clothe rhetoric in emotional language. But it is not best academic practice. </p> <p>First, the caricature: \u00a3200,000 worth of staff time was claimed to have been expended. But on what? On demonstrating that the curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment were fit for their purpose. Any university that cares about its academic standards uses staff time constantly to monitor these things for itself, and should have little difficulty in satisfying Quality Assurance Agency reviewers that all is well. Surely we are not asked to believe that Warwick only worries about them when QAA comes visiting? </p> <p>Then the facts ignored. \"Nobody explains\" that universities are judged against their own objectives, claimed the article. Oh yes we do! In Guardian Higher and the Sunday Times in 1999, in a paper sent to all universities, and in our evidence to the Education Select Committee, to name but a few. </p> <p>The rhetoric of slander may spice up a story, but it misleads. A review is not an accusation of failure, but an opportunity to demonstrate success. </p> <p>On one thing I can agree. The process of review they experienced is far from perfect. It is a process the QAA inherited from its predecessors. Because we know its limitations, we have been working with the academic community to design a better process, which is operating in Scotland now, and will be used throughout the UK from later this year. It will be less intrusive, and will not require a mountain of paper. It is based on clear standards, to aid comparability. A Warwick economist is amongst those who drafted the standard for economics. </p> <p>What will not change is the need for independent verification of claims to provide a high quality service. As students and parents are asked to pay directly for higher education, they will want to know they are getting value for their money. The higher the fees, the greater will be the demand for impartial evidence of high standards. </p> <p>The public is sceptical, and understandably so, about professional services of all kinds. They have been let down by medical experts, financial experts and safety experts. Working together, all of us in higher education must ensure they are not let down by academic experts. That means we must strive constantly to enhance the quality of provision and the standards of academic awards. Dissemination of good practice, through the review process, is an important part of this. </p> <p>Enhancement alone is not enough. The Bristol surgeons, many financial advisers and the Railtrack safety engineers lost public confidence. Their professional reputations, and the standing of their institutions suffered. The Warwick professors are wrong to dismiss the promotion of public confidence as an expensive public relations exercise. Universities must maintain high standards, and the public must be confident they are doing so. Those who spend the public's money must retain the public's confidence. Write that down in your notebook, professor. </p> <p>John Randall is chief executive at the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</p>",

First, the caricature: \u00a3200,000 worth of staff time was claimed to have been expended. But on what? On demonstrating that the curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment were fit for their purpose. Any university that cares about its academic standards uses staff time constantly to monitor these things for itself, and should have little difficulty in satisfying Quality Assurance Agency reviewers that all is well. Surely we are not asked to believe that Warwick only worries about them when QAA comes visiting? Then the facts ignored. \"Nobody explains\" that universities are judged against their own objectives, claimed the article. Oh yes we do! In Guardian Higher and the Sunday Times in 1999, in a paper sent to all universities, and in our evidence to the Education Select Committee, to name but a few. The rhetoric of slander may spice up a story, but it misleads. A review is not an accusation of failure, but an opportunity to demonstrate success. On one thing I can agree. The process of review they experienced is far from perfect. It is a process the QAA inherited from its predecessors. Because we know its limitations, we have been working with the academic community to design a better process, which is operating in Scotland now, and will be used throughout the UK from later this year. It will be less intrusive, and will not require a mountain of paper. It is based on clear standards, to aid comparability. A Warwick economist is amongst those who drafted the standard for economics. What will not change is the need for independent verification of claims to provide a high quality service. As students and parents are asked to pay directly for higher education, they will want to know they are getting value for their money. The higher the fees, the greater will be the demand for impartial evidence of high standards. The public is sceptical, and understandably so, about professional services of all kinds. They have been let down by medical experts, financial experts and safety experts. Working together, all of us in higher education must ensure they are not let down by academic experts. That means we must strive constantly to enhance the quality of provision and the standards of academic awards. Dissemination of good practice, through the review process, is an important part of this. Enhancement alone is not enough. The Bristol surgeons, many financial advisers and the Railtrack safety engineers lost public confidence. Their professional reputations, and the standing of their institutions suffered. The Warwick professors are wrong to dismiss the promotion of public confidence as an expensive public relations exercise. Universities must maintain high standards, and the public must be confident they are doing so. Those who spend the public's money must retain the public's confidence. Write that down in your notebook, professor. John Randall is chief executive at the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education",

      "body": "<p>The past 15 years or so have seen a sustained assault on the discipline of history. It has been mounted by poststructuralists who take their cue from linguistic theories that proclaim there is no consistent or logical relationship between language and the concepts to which it refers. Language, to quote one of them, is \"an infinite play of significations\". Moreover, we can only apprehend the world through language. Thus, in effect, nothing exists outside language. </p> <p>Taken together these two theories imply that knowledge is created, not discovered. Every time we read a text, we reinvent it. Nobody who writes a text has a hope of controlling the ways in which it is read. Meaning is put into it by the reader, not by the writer. </p> <p>In the face of such theories, the commonsense reaction is to kick a chair, or indeed kick a poststructuralist, and take the physical sensation as proof that something exists outside language. But - whatever the merits of this procedure - you can't do it in history, which no longer exists in a physical sense at all. What happened has to be reconstructed from the remains it has left behind, and most of these are texts of one kind or another. </p> <p>A string of writers on the study of history has concluded that we can never know anything for sure about the past. The meaning of the historical documents we all rely on cannot be fixed by their authors. </p> <p>Historians reinvent documents every time they read them. So we can't penetrate the veil of the document to any past reality behind it. </p> <p>In the second half of the 1990s, the flaws in the poststructuralist position became apparent. I identified some in my book In Defence of History, published in 1997; others, such as Raymond Tallis, identified the theoretical illogicalities behind them. The self-contradictory nature of the poststructuralists' position became apparent when they launched a series of fierce attacks on my book. Many accused me of misreading or distorting what they had said. But how could such an accusation hold water if meaning was put into a text only by its reader and not by its writer? </p> <p>In the end, poststructuralists appeared to believe in their ability to write texts in such a way as to impose strict limits on their interpretation. Moreover, they must also have believed that what they were saying was true, or why would they have said it? Yet their theories denied the existence of any kind of truth at all. </p> <p>Language does bear some relation, however complex and mediated, to what it refers to - that, surely, was why it was invented. You can interpret texts in different ways, but the number of ways is restricted by the words that are in them. This point emerged with clarity in last year's libel action by David Irving against American historian Deborah Lipstadt, who had accused him of falsifying and distorting the historical record. </p> <p>The High Court's judgment, delivered last April, found that Irving had indeed done this. He had added words to documents when he quoted them in his books. He had taken out sentences and paragraphs from sources he cited. He had transposed sentences in other sources so as to change their meaning. He had presented mistranslations of the original German in order to support his arguments. He had used at least one source he knew to be a forgery. He had failed to take a sufficiently critical attitude to some evidence and adopted an implausibly over-sceptical attitude to other evidence. </p> <p>The High Court judgment was careful to point out that historians disagree widely on many matters of interpretation of issues such as the Holocaust. What was at issue was historians' ability to reconstruct past events, not the interpretations they put on them. </p> <p>The task of reconstruction is difficult, and can only ever be carried out partially. We are dealing with matters of probability. In the case of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, whose existence Irving denied, the probability is overwhelming; in other matters less so. Historians have always admitted that we can only see the past \"through a glass, darkly\". </p> <p>Most poststructuralists appear to think of themselves as on the left. But as the Irving case showed, the belief that all representations of the past are equally valid and equally unprovable does not just subvert comfortable \"bourgeois\" certainties. It can also disarm any attempt to criticise as untruthful the misrepresentation of past reality in the service of racist and anti-semitic ideology. </p> <p><strong>Richard J Evans</strong> is professor of modern history at Cambridge University. His book, In Defence of History, has been reissued by Granta with a lengthy, new afterword replying to his critics. His new book, Telling Lies About Hitler: History, the Holocaust and the David Irving Trial, will be published by Heinemann in March.</p> <p>Over the years the practice of history has witnessed a good many shifts and turns. Since the 1960s, for example, the discipline has experienced a social science turn, a cliometric or statistics turn, a women's history turn, a cultural history turn and so on. These are not fads. Each has developed and still remains a vibrant way in which historians elect to study and write about change over time. </p> <p>But, in this \"history of history\" one thing has apparently not changed. That is its epistemology. In other words, despite all these methodological developments and thematic innovations, the basic way historians \"know\" has remained fixed. </p> <p>Despite the use of statistics and the new themes (society, women, gender, culture) there remain two immovable points in the historian's universe: empiricism and analysis. By empiricism is meant knowledge gained through the senses as we observe and experience life. </p> <p>In the case of historians the assumption is that the reality of the past can be discovered through the observation of its traces - the evidence. By analysis is meant inference - the reasoned drawing of conclusions. As the product of the Enlightenment, the empirical-analytical model has become the epistemology for doing history. </p> <p>However, since the 1960s, doubts about the empirical-analytical paradigm as the privileged route to knowing have emerged. This has not happened in history alone but in all the arts, humanities, social sciences and even the physical and life sciences. How can we be sure that the data and inference really do get us close to true meaning? How can we trust our sources - not because they are false or forgeries or missing, but because of the larger claims empiricism makes about our powers to find and represent their meaning accurately? </p> <p>It is no abstract philosophical point: where does meaning come from in history? Is it the past itself or the historian as s/he narrates it, or both? This is the essence of the postmodern challenge, the turn toward the narrative-linguistic. </p> <p>The narrative-linguistic turn in history continues to deploy the empirical-analytical model. But it does so self-consciously and in ways which, without denying the reality of the past or brushing aside the desire to get at meaning, extends the knowing process to include its representation, and the cognitive form we give to the past within our texts. The narrative-linguistic turn recognises that history, a literary activity, is self-consciously (and self-evidently) authored. </p> <p>Postmodern historians thus ask many fresh questions. Is there only one story to the past, or several, and is it the past or the historian who provides them? Is history what happened or what historians tell us happened? If the latter, we must understand the telling process which is so essential to knowing. All these questions have to be addressed when we do history: to ignore them is to do only half the job. </p> <p>The emphasis now is less on history as a process of objective discovery and report and instead more on more of an acceptance of its unavoidably fictive nature - that is, its literary constructedness. </p> <p>By this I mean recognising the assumptions that underpin authorial activity in creating the text and which are already (in a pre-empirical sense) and necessarily brought to the historical field, often determining the selection of evidence and its most likely meaning. None of this is to deny the reality of the past or to become amoral or relativist or to slip into the denial of the data. It is, rather, to recognise that history is a complex linguistic process, and that the truth of the past cannot be revealed by the analysis of its traces alone. </p> <p>In other words, the postmodern challenge extends the remit of history to include the historian's pre-narrative and pre-figurative assumptions and how we weave those assumptions into forms or strategies of narrative explanation. </p> <p>In a very real sense the postmodern challenge forces us to face up to the highly complex question of how we can know truthful things about the past and what we, as moral beings, do as a result. </p> <p><strong>Alun Munslow</strong> is professor of history and historical theory at Staffordshire University and is UK editor of Rethinking History: The Journal of Theory and Practice.</p> <p><strong> Links</strong><br></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/alun.htm\">www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/alun.htm</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/pob.htm\">www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/pob.htm</a><br> <a href=\"http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/jeffreyhearn/home~1htm\">ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/jeffreyhearn/home~1htm</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/discourse1.htm\">www.ihr.sas.ac.uk/ihr/reviews/discourse1.htm</a> </p>",

Language does bear some relation, however complex and mediated, to what it refers to - that, surely, was why it was invented. You can interpret texts in different ways, but the number of ways is restricted by the words that are in them. This point emerged with clarity in last year's libel action by David Irving against American historian Deborah Lipstadt, who had accused him of falsifying and distorting the historical record. The High Court's judgment, delivered last April, found that Irving had indeed done this. He had added words to documents when he quoted them in his books. He had taken out sentences and paragraphs from sources he cited. He had transposed sentences in other sources so as to change their meaning. He had presented mistranslations of the original German in order to support his arguments. He had used at least one source he knew to be a forgery. He had failed to take a sufficiently critical attitude to some evidence and adopted an implausibly over-sceptical attitude to other evidence. The High Court judgment was careful to point out that historians disagree widely on many matters of interpretation of issues such as the Holocaust. What was at issue was historians' ability to reconstruct past events, not the interpretations they put on them. The task of reconstruction is difficult, and can only ever be carried out partially. We are dealing with matters of probability. In the case of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, whose existence Irving denied, the probability is overwhelming; in other matters less so. Historians have always admitted that we can only see the past \"through a glass, darkly\". Most poststructuralists appear to think of themselves as on the left. But as the Irving case showed, the belief that all representations of the past are equally valid and equally unprovable does not just subvert comfortable \"bourgeois\" certainties. It can also disarm any attempt to criticise as untruthful the misrepresentation of past reality in the service of racist and anti-semitic ideology. Richard J Evans is professor of modern history at Cambridge University. His book, In Defence of History, has been reissued by Granta with a lengthy, new afterword replying to his critics. His new book, Telling Lies About Hitler: History, the Holocaust and the David Irving Trial, will be published by Heinemann in March. Over the years the practice of history has witnessed a good many shifts and turns. Since the 1960s, for example, the discipline has experienced a social science turn, a cliometric or statistics turn, a women's history turn, a cultural history turn and so on. These are not fads. Each has developed and still remains a vibrant way in which historians elect to study and write about change over time. But, in this \"history of history\" one thing has apparently not changed. That is its epistemology. In other words, despite all these methodological developments and thematic innovations, the basic way historians \"know\" has remained fixed. Despite the use of statistics and the new themes (society, women, gender, culture) there remain two immovable points in the historian's universe: empiricism and analysis. By empiricism is meant knowledge gained through the senses as we observe and experience life. In the case of historians the assumption is that the reality of the past can be discovered through the observation of its traces - the evidence. By analysis is meant inference - the reasoned drawing of conclusions. As the product of the Enlightenment, the empirical-analytical model has become the epistemology for doing history. However, since the 1960s, doubts about the empirical-analytical paradigm as the privileged route to knowing have emerged. This has not happened in history alone but in all the arts, humanities, social sciences and even the physical and life sciences. How can we be sure that the data and inference really do get us close to true meaning? How can we trust our sources - not because they are false or forgeries or missing, but because of the larger claims empiricism makes about our powers to find and represent their meaning accurately? It is no abstract philosophical point: where does meaning come from in history? Is it the past itself or the historian as s/he narrates it, or both? This is the essence of the postmodern challenge, the turn toward the narrative-linguistic. The narrative-linguistic turn in history continues to deploy the empirical-analytical model. But it does so self-consciously and in ways which, without denying the reality of the past or brushing aside the desire to get at meaning, extends the knowing process to include its representation, and the cognitive form we give to the past within our texts. The narrative-linguistic turn recognises that history, a literary activity, is self-consciously (and self-evidently) authored. Postmodern historians thus ask many fresh questions. Is there only one story to the past, or several, and is it the past or the historian who provides them? Is history what happened or what historians tell us happened? If the latter, we must understand the telling process which is so essential to knowing. All these questions have to be addressed when we do history: to ignore them is to do only half the job. The emphasis now is less on history as a process of objective discovery and report and instead more on more of an acceptance of its unavoidably fictive nature - that is, its literary constructedness. By this I mean recognising the assumptions that underpin authorial activity in creating the text and which are already (in a pre-empirical sense) and necessarily brought to the historical field, often determining the selection of evidence and its most likely meaning. None of this is to deny the reality of the past or to become amoral or relativist or to slip into the denial of the data. It is, rather, to recognise that history is a complex linguistic process, and that the truth of the past cannot be revealed by the analysis of its traces alone. In other words, the postmodern challenge extends the remit of history to include the historian's pre-narrative and pre-figurative assumptions and how we weave those assumptions into forms or strategies of narrative explanation. In a very real sense the postmodern challenge forces us to face up to the highly complex question of how we can know truthful things about the past and what we, as moral beings, do as a result.

      "bodyText": "Birmingham city council has drawn up plans for its pupils to receive lessons via internet video links as a way of coping with the teacher shortage. The council hopes that existing hi-tech video conference equipment can be used to allow more than one class to be taught at a time. The council stressed yesterday that that none of its schools was operating on a reduced working week, but timetables were being squeezed, and local agencies for temporary staff were clearly stretched. It aims to ensure that no children have to be sent home, as has happened at three schools in other midlands authorities. The authority is to issue guidance to schools, including instructions on setting up internet links between two classrooms fitted with cameras and microphones, so one teacher can cover both. \"This is not a question of replacing teachers,\" a council spokeswoman said. \"It is a matter of using existing technology to maximum advantage.\" She said the new technology was particularly appropriate for teaching languages and for activities such as debates. The council is also urging former teachers to rejoin the profession. The government yesterday announced the next step towards the classroom of the future, naming 12 local education authorities in England that have been awarded \u00a310m to deliver education using state-of-the-art facilities in more than 30 pilot schemes. In Cornwall, for example, a space-age mission control centre is being built in partnership with the National Space and Science Centre. Students will be able to learn how to fly a space mission using remote control, video conferencing and remote sensing. Local authorities were invited to put forward their ideas after a discussion paper on the classroom of the future was published last June. They were asked to take account of future developments in education, such as longer working days, and the huge projected increase in internet use.",

For someone who already speaks Spanish, there are some useful revision aids. But it's not user-friendly - you'd need a lot of patience to navigate with any ease. Quia www.quia.com/index.html Suitable for: KS3 pupils &amp; teachers An excellent US site recommended by Edexcel exam board. Interactive exercises designed by teachers in many languages provide templates for designing your own exercises. For beginners.

Avenging Angel www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk Suitable for: KS2 pupils &amp; teachers A useful site based on a book of the same title. Select \"Florence's Statistics\" to see a pie chart which Florence drew up to indicate the main causes of death in the military hospital (she is credited with inventing the pie chart). Country Joe McDonald www.countryjoe.com/nightingale Suitable for: KS2 pupils &amp; teachers This unlikely source - Country Joe McDonald's tribute to Florence Nightingale - is one of the best sites on the subject, with well illustrated chronological details of Nightingale's life.

But mention \"Ofsted inspection\" to the school's headteacher, Evelyn Pittman, and you'll have her quaking in her boots. </p> <p>\"Teaching is a very intimate process,\" she explains, \"and it can be hard to be observed. On weekdays during term-time primary teachers see the children in their class for more hours a day than their parents do. It's like a family.\" </p> <p>Tetherdown received one of Ofsted's new two-day inspections for schools deemed to be performing well last September, just 15 months after Pittman had undergone a full Ofsted inspection at her previous school where she was acting head. Although the two-day inspection is less stressful for teachers than a full five-day one, she says, the burden on the head is the same. </p> <p>\"If the head does not have a clear and realistic view of the school and of how to address any weaknesses the whole thing goes down the pan. </p> <p>\"I was lucky both times with the team of inspectors the schools had; they were excoriatingly thorough but there was no other agenda and the inspections were clear and fair. </p> <p>\"The first report highlighted a couple of problems the school had but was very positive for me. They felt I had done very well as acting head at addressing those problems. </p> <p>\"The second inspection report commended the school and focused on a couple of areas we were already addressing, such as assessments. But it was harder to get a handle on than the first; the guidance about what to expect was vaguer about what was required.\" </p> <p>The prospect of an inspection does provide a deadline for the school to get things done, and while the inspectors are on site everyone performs to the very best of their ability, but Pittman says it is impossible to suddenly paper over the cracks of a problem school with industrial quantities of educational Polyfilla and hope the inspectors won't notice. \"That sort of poor leadership just gets found out,\" she says. When the inspectors finally left, the staff felt a sense of collective euphoria, but this high was closely followed by what Pittman calls POTS - Post-Ofsted Traumatic Syndrome. </p> <p>\"It's very stressful to go through all that and after the initial euphoria I hit rock bottom for a week or two. Other heads I've spoken to who also had good reports felt exactly the same. I keep saying I'll get out of teaching before the next one comes around, but who knows? </p> <p>\"On balance I would say that Ofsteds are a bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut if a school is already genuinely self-evaluating. </p> <p>\"I think that the important thing for a school to do is to take charge of their own Ofsted. In the end Ofsted is what you make of it.\" </p> <p><strong> The verdict</strong> </p> <p><strong>Behaviour of the inspectors:</strong> Knowledgeable, shrewd, rigorous. </p> <p><strong> Quality of the written report:</strong> A fairly accurate picture, but raised no new, major issues. </p> <p><strong>Higher Side Community Comprehensive, Knowsley</strong><br> </p> <p>\"It's very stressful,\" says Chris Wilkinson, headteacher of Higher Side, which was inspected last February. \"And it doesn't help schools with their overall development. The process is judgmental rather than developmental.\" While Wilkinson says that the process isn't all bad - his school's last two Ofsted reports have been good and have included constructive suggestions - he believes that there must be a better way of ensuring that schools run well and can keep on improving. </p> <p>\"The way schools are inspected at the moment is both cumbersome and very expensive. While it's nice to bask in the glory when you get a positive report, it doesn't actually help the school that much. The inspectors come, they inspect and then they go. Schools have that empty feeling of being left on their own. To be inspected and to be judged isn't really what schools need. Staff always look ill in the build-up to Ofsted.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson suggests that an alternative model would be that used by Investors in People initiatives where people and organisations are assessed and supported on an ongoing basis. He believes that it is important for schools to receive support in the post-Ofsted period when they are implementing changes to the school as flagged up by the inspectors. </p> <p>There are techniques that schools can use to make an Ofsted inspection a more positive experience than it might otherwise be, he says. \"The trick is to work with the inspectors and use the process and the report as a tool for the school. And it's also important as a head to make sure that your staff don't peak too soon because the waiting part is often the worst.\" </p> <p>Inspectors don't really see the school functioning as it normally does, believes Wilkinson. \"It takes the first half of the week for everyone's nerves to settle down. And the absence of one or two key people at a crucial time can make an organisation very vulnerable.\" </p> <p>But one group who seem to positively enjoy the experience are the pupils, says Wilkinson. \"It's always amazed me how relaxed the children are,\" he says. \"They like to show the inspectors what they can do, they tell the truth about the school and you see them having some quite animated conversations with the inspectors.\" </p> <p> <strong> The verdict</strong></p> <p><strong>Behaviour of the inspectors:</strong> Professional. We were lucky with the ones we got. </p> <p><strong> Quality of the written repor:t</strong> Constructive. Thorough.</p>",

But it was harder to get a handle on than the first; the guidance about what to expect was vaguer about what was required.\" The prospect of an inspection does provide a deadline for the school to get things done, and while the inspectors are on site everyone performs to the very best of their ability, but Pittman says it is impossible to suddenly paper over the cracks of a problem school with industrial quantities of educational Polyfilla and hope the inspectors won't notice. \"That sort of poor leadership just gets found out,\" she says. When the inspectors finally left, the staff felt a sense of collective euphoria, but this high was closely followed by what Pittman calls POTS - Post-Ofsted Traumatic Syndrome. \"It's very stressful to go through all that and after the initial euphoria I hit rock bottom for a week or two. Other heads I've spoken to who also had good reports felt exactly the same. I keep saying I'll get out of teaching before the next one comes around, but who knows? \"On balance I would say that Ofsteds are a bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut if a school is already genuinely self-evaluating. \"I think that the important thing for a school to do is to take charge of their own Ofsted. In the end Ofsted is what you make of it.\" The verdict Behaviour of the inspectors: Knowledgeable, shrewd, rigorous. Quality of the written report: A fairly accurate picture, but raised no new, major issues. Higher Side Community Comprehensive, Knowsley \"It's very stressful,\" says Chris Wilkinson, headteacher of Higher Side, which was inspected last February. \"And it doesn't help schools with their overall development. The process is judgmental rather than developmental.\" While Wilkinson says that the process isn't all bad - his school's last two Ofsted reports have been good and have included constructive suggestions - he believes that there must be a better way of ensuring that schools run well and can keep on improving. \"The way schools are inspected at the moment is both cumbersome and very expensive. While it's nice to bask in the glory when you get a positive report, it doesn't actually help the school that much. The inspectors come, they inspect and then they go. Schools have that empty feeling of being left on their own. To be inspected and to be judged isn't really what schools need. Staff always look ill in the build-up to Ofsted.\" Wilkinson suggests that an alternative model would be that used by Investors in People initiatives where people and organisations are assessed and supported on an ongoing basis. He believes that it is important for schools to receive support in the post-Ofsted period when they are implementing changes to the school as flagged up by the inspectors. There are techniques that schools can use to make an Ofsted inspection a more positive experience than it might otherwise be, he says. \"The trick is to work with the inspectors and use the process and the report as a tool for the school. And it's also important as a head to make sure that your staff don't peak too soon because the waiting part is often the worst.\" Inspectors don't really see the school functioning as it normally does, believes Wilkinson. \"It takes the first half of the week for everyone's nerves to settle down. And the absence of one or two key people at a crucial time can make an organisation very vulnerable.\" But one group who seem to positively enjoy the experience are the pupils, says Wilkinson. \"It's always amazed me how relaxed the children are,\" he says. \"They like to show the inspectors what they can do, they tell the truth about the school and you see them having some quite animated conversations with the inspectors.\" The verdict Behaviour of the inspectors: Professional. We were lucky with the ones we got. Quality of the written repor:t Constructive. Thorough.",

      "body": "<p>When is a blue not a blue? When it's a Levi's blue. The clothing manufacturer, Levi Strauss, is currently involved in a lengthy court case at the European Court of Justice in Brussels to prevent Tesco from selling its jeans. The problem, Levi insists, is not that the supermarket undercuts the normal high street retail price by up to \u00a320, but that Tesco's staff aren't trained to sell their products properly. So what training do sales assistants need to sell jeans, and how does it differ from normal retail training? </p> <p>\"Staff have to explain how one blue is different from another blue,\" said Mark Elliott, a Levi Strauss &amp; Co's spokesman. \"These things are important to jeans aficionados. Customers need advice on what's on offer and the difference between loose and baggy, straight and slim. We're not saying you need a university degree to sell jeans but if a person is cutting bacon and filling shelves one minute, it's not possible for them to sell jeans as well.\" </p> <p>This will come as something of a surprise to anyone who has ever bought a pair of jeans from a clothes shop, where the prime qualification for a sales assistant often seems to be terminal and monosyllabic cool, and the specialist knowledge is limited to differentiating between flares and straight leg, zip or button fly, and waist size. </p> <p>Mark Elliott's remarks may also come as a surprise to some of his own sales staff. A phone call to one of Levi's central London stores last week produced the following response. \"We look to recruit people with some sales experience,\" said a member of staff, \"but we do offer our own training in product knowledge and operating the till.\" So, is this product knowledge particularly demanding? \"To be honest, no. We have about four or five concepts which shouldn't take anyone very long to get to grips with.\" </p> <p>While each retail organisation may offer its own staff training, there is a national qualification - the Retail Operations NVQ level 2 - for sales assistants. The qualification, which is divided into 25 modules - varying from health and safety to display and product information - of which candidates are assessed on at least eight, is usually completed within six months. Staff are normally given two months to become acquainted with the products and then assessed in store over the next four. </p> <p>\"The NVQ level 2 is generic across the sector,\" says Margaret Barkway, City &amp; Guilds chief verifier for distributive industries, \"and is used in all types of retail environment. The specialised knowledge for someone selling jeans would centre around fit, fabric, leg-length and what age groups the particular styles are aimed at. It's hardly rocket science, but it is detailed.\" </p> <p>A lecturer in retail at a further education college in the south of England, who prefers to remain anonymous, acknowledges that retail staff training does raise various issues. \"For the NVQ level 2, staff are generally trained on the specific goods which they are selling by their line managers,\" she says, \"and one could argue that if Tesco managers haven't themselves been trained on a particular product range then they won't have the necessary experience to train their staff. Levi is likely to have based their argument on issues such as displaying stock to attract customer interest and meeting customers needs for information and advice, as Tesco staff may not have the same levels of knowledge on product information and labelling as specialist clothing retailers and therefore may not be able to ask customers the right questions to ensure they go away with exactly what they want.\" </p> <p>However, she concedes \"When it comes to jeans, most people have a fair idea of what brand, style, fit and size they are looking for,\" she says, \"so the role of the sales assistant may be less important than in other sectors.\" </p> <p>For its part, Tesco is sure that it is more than capable of flogging Levi's. The company boasts a great record on staff training and has instituted its own gold, silver and bronze awards that it regards as an improvement on the NVQ level 2. It clearly regards Levi's court action as a smoke screen for price protection. \"We don't think five minutes more training than our staff get justifies an extra \u00a320 on the price and neither do our customers,\" said Simon Soffe, a Tesco spokesman.</p>",

When David Blunkett met the newly appointed Fryer committee, not long after the last general election, he discussed the things he would like to be judged by at the end of the parliament. He made clear that he intended to make a difference to adult education - not just the kind of adult studies that lead to a qualification, or to promotion at work, but the kind that people do for pleasure, to add dignity and stimulus to life. In short, he was talking about the kind of adult education for which the local education authorities were responsible. </p> <p>He said, memorably, that it takes a long time to turn round an oil tanker. You need patience, but above all you need a sense of where you want to go. It was a welcome message. </p> <p>And, after a long wait, it seems to me that we now have the tanker pointing in the right direction, with three related government announcements on a single day last week. The first promised a 9% increase in local authority-secured adult education in 2002/3, building on an increase of more than 5% in the year about to start. </p> <p>Second, the first ever national capital building programme for local authority adult education has been established for 2002/3. The \u00a316m on offer won't build people's palaces of culture in every local community, but it is an important first step. It recognises that adults benefit from learning accommodation suited to their own needs. The third sum available this year makes up the losses in this year's standard spending allowance for those authorities that lost out in the transfer of local authority adult education budgets to the new Learning and Skills Council. </p> <p>At first sight this may look like modest growth, but it comes at the end of a bleak decade for community-based adult learning. In the run-up to the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act Sheila Lawlor, the Tory pamphleteer, argued that all money spent by local authorities on adult education was money stolen from schools, and should be outlawed; except in areas of disadvantage, where any spending should be met by social services. Otherwise, she argued, if people want opportunities they can go to the market for them. These ideas survived into a white paper, but were seen off by an alliance led by the National Federation of Women's Institutes. </p> <p>Nevertheless, budgets for uncertificated adult education were remorselessly squeezed through the 1990s, as local authorities found it harder to balance the books, and devolve budgets to the schools. Many tutors accelerated the flight away from learning for pleasure by changing modest French conversation classes to credit-bearing qualifications courses, which attracted better funding. The result was that participation among people over 60 plummeted by 40% between 1990 and 1994. It looked as though public funding for such work was on the way out. </p> <p>Despite David Blunkett's enthusiasm, anxieties continued in the debates leading to the Learning and Skills Act. Would adult education be swallowed up by reconfigured Training and Enterprise Councils? Would local authorities take their bats home once \"their\" budgets were transferred to the new Learning and Skills Council? How would voluntary sector providers fit in? A step at a time, the questions are being answered. There is a two-year transitional guarantee for local authority providers to maintain provision. The Learning and Skills Council has been given a strong priority to expand adult community learning, particularly in the poorest communities. And now there is firm cash to back the expansion - for basic skills, for credit-bearing courses, for new forms of higher education, for further education, which is mainly for adults, and for the modest evening class. </p> <p>So is everything in the garden rosy? Not quite. The new law still gives young learners entitlements, and adults get what is left over. Fine, whilst we have the current ministers. But how will adults fare under a different, perhaps less enlightened and inspiring secretary of state? </p> <p>Alan Tuckett is director of the National Institution of Adult Continuing Education</p>",

      "body": "<p>The lecture hall is packed with students staring at a large screen. The best bloodsport on telly is playing. Like the rest of the nation these students are hooked on Popstars, ITV's update of the Circus Maximus. </p> <p>But it is not for pleasure that they are watching Nigel Lythgoe, LWT's Caesar of light entertainment, and his two co-judges give the thumbs down to hordes of aspiring Britneys and Robbies. </p> <p>It is part of their education. They are watching the video clips to learn. These youngsters, mostly aged 16 to 18, are at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM), which bills itself Europe's leading school for rock and pop musicians. </p> <p>Like the hopefuls in Popstars, many of them will soon be going in for auditions. Many have been blooded by the process already. </p> <p>They are focusing on the juiciest clips from the series to date, including Lythgoe's franker comments on some of the dire performances, which have inevitably earned him a \"Nasty Nigel\" tag in the tabloids. </p> <p>\"I put it down to their ears. They must be hearing something different from us,\" he says after a song has been murdered for the umpteenth time. </p> <p>One bruised hopeful fatuously reported Lythgoe to the Broadcasting Standards Council for mocking his performance of Robbie Williams' hit Angels. But such whining is the last thing the students are being told they should do. </p> <p>\"Nigel is a hero,\" is the message they are getting from their lecturer, Bruce Dickinson. </p> <p>\"Your friends in the music industry are the people who tell you the truth, not the people who tell you you're brilliant and going to be a star.\" </p> <p>A failed audition like a bad gig must be learned from, he says. </p> <p>\"Rejections at auditions are hugely positive experiences.\" </p> <p>So, what are the lessons from the rejections on Popstars? </p> <p>\"Not enough preparation in many cases. </p> <p>\"Flawed attitudes in others.\" </p> <p>The students watch one young woman arguing with the judges. She is insisting on singing the \"bridge\" passage from a number. They want her to sing something else. </p> <p>\"Most of the time you've got to work out what the people holding the audition want,\" Dickinson says. \"It's not what you want.\" </p> <p>Teaching rock and pop is a growth industry, says Phil Brookes, 31, MD and co-founder of the academy. </p> <p>The further education sector has a long and honourable history of teaching performing art, but there hasn't been much that has focused exclusively on the needs of future pop and rock musicians, he says. </p> <p>He says that the academy scores because all its teachers are seasoned pop and rock professionals and because it has very good contacts in the industry. </p> <p>\"We are always looking at what skills the industry requires.\" </p> <p>The academy began in the finest tradition of rock ventures. </p> <p>\"I started it seven years ago in my mum's garage in Guildford,\" Brookes says. </p> <p>He was a guitar tutor who realised that there was nothing structured for kids learning the instrument with a view to a pop career. </p> <p>\"We started with guitar, drums and vocal part-time course. There were 40 students.\" </p> <p> <strong> A</strong> year later full-time courses validated by Edexel were launched. The student roll soared to 120. In 1998 the fledgling academy moved into premises in the centre of Guildford and added a music production course. </p> <p>Then came the big break. The academy set up home next door in a handsome building, which in 1901 housed Dennis Brothers, Europe's first custom-built car industry. </p> <p>Its 22 studios and theatre were officially opened last year by the heritage secretary Chris Smith. </p> <p>There are now 420 full-time students and twice as many part-timers. A tenth of the students come from the EU, notably Germany and Italy. A further 5% come from other coun tries overseas. </p> <p>The ACM, a company limited by guarantee, is affiliated to Guildford College. It offers a level three diploma and a level four higher diploma. From next year it will also run a degree in contemporary music, a BA for pop singers validated by Middlesex university. </p> <p>Another new venture it is launching in September is the Pop Academy, aimed at 12-year-olds. In an industry seemingly getting younger by the minute, that is the age for catching tomorrow's pop stars. </p> <p>For four hours on Saturday mornings these teenies will be taught voice, choreography, video performance and . . . image. </p> <p>The academy is not as rigidly selective as some performing arts institutions, but does not run an absolutely open door. There were 600 applicants for the full-time places this year. Everybody is auditioned. </p> <p>\"If you came here wanting a guitar place and you couldn't play the guitar, we wouldn't be able to offer you a place,\" explains Ian Edwards, who teaches guitar. </p> <p>About 80% of the students on the guitar and drums courses are male. The majority on the vocal courses is female. In every case the aim over the year is to produce well-rounded professionals who will slot into the pop and rock industry. </p> <p>\"We don't tell people they'll be the next Ronan Keating,\" says Edwards. \"But Ronan Keating has sound and lighting engineers, a record company, a publishing company - all these areas are legitimate jobs for our students.\" </p> <p>Every Thursday, all students must attend three lectures on various aspects of the business of pop music. </p> <p>In its short existence the academy has groomed some promising performers. A recent student landed three world tours on guitar with Boyzone. </p> <p>Lucy Randell, 18, who completed her course in the summer, is in the final four candidates to perform Britain's entry in the Eurovision song contest with a song called Just Another Rainbow. </p> <p>She switched to the academy three months into a Btec in performing arts at Barking College. \"I didn't really click at that.\" </p> <p>Like other students she wanted a course focused on pop. </p> <p>Bruce Dickinson reckons that parents these days are more prepared to countenance pop and rock training as a viable career path for their children. </p> <p>\"We've now got a generation of young people whose parents have got Never Mind The Bollocks by the Sex Pistols in their collections. </p> <p>\"They don't think their kids are aliens for thinking seriously of pop music education.\" </p> <p>There is one problem. </p> <p>\"One of the functions of pop music is to piss off your parents. </p> <p>\"That's difficult for these youngsters with parents listening to the Sex Pistols.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The lecture hall is packed with students staring at a large screen. The best bloodsport on telly is playing. Like the rest of the nation these students are hooked on Popstars, ITV's update of the Circus Maximus. But it is not for pleasure that they are watching Nigel Lythgoe, LWT's Caesar of light entertainment, and his two co-judges give the thumbs down to hordes of aspiring Britneys and Robbies. It is part of their education. They are watching the video clips to learn. These youngsters, mostly aged 16 to 18, are at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM), which bills itself Europe's leading school for rock and pop musicians. Like the hopefuls in Popstars, many of them will soon be going in for auditions. Many have been blooded by the process already. They are focusing on the juiciest clips from the series to date, including Lythgoe's franker comments on some of the dire performances, which have inevitably earned him a \"Nasty Nigel\" tag in the tabloids. \"I put it down to their ears. They must be hearing something different from us,\" he says after a song has been murdered for the umpteenth time. One bruised hopeful fatuously reported Lythgoe to the Broadcasting Standards Council for mocking his performance of Robbie Williams' hit Angels. But such whining is the last thing the students are being told they should do. \"Nigel is a hero,\" is the message they are getting from their lecturer, Bruce Dickinson. \"Your friends in the music industry are the people who tell you the truth, not the people who tell you you're brilliant and going to be a star.\" A failed audition like a bad gig must be learned from, he says. \"Rejections at auditions are hugely positive experiences.\" So, what are the lessons from the rejections on Popstars? \"Not enough preparation in many cases. \"Flawed attitudes in others.\" The students watch one young woman arguing with the judges. She is insisting on singing the \"bridge\" passage from a number. They want her to sing something else. \"Most of the time you've got to work out what the people holding the audition want,\" Dickinson says. \"It's not what you want.\" Teaching rock and pop is a growth industry, says Phil Brookes, 31, MD and co-founder of the academy. The further education sector has a long and honourable history of teaching performing art, but there hasn't been much that has focused exclusively on the needs of future pop and rock musicians, he says. He says that the academy scores because all its teachers are seasoned pop and rock professionals and because it has very good contacts in the industry. \"We are always looking at what skills the industry requires.\" The academy began in the finest tradition of rock ventures. \"I started it seven years ago in my mum's garage in Guildford,\" Brookes says. He was a guitar tutor who realised that there was nothing structured for kids learning the instrument with a view to a pop career. \"We started with guitar, drums and vocal part-time course. There were 40 students.\" A year later full-time courses validated by Edexel were launched. The student roll soared to 120. In 1998 the fledgling academy moved into premises in the centre of Guildford and added a music production course. Then came the big break. The academy set up home next door in a handsome building, which in 1901 housed Dennis Brothers, Europe's first custom-built car industry. Its 22 studios and theatre were officially opened last year by the heritage secretary Chris Smith. There are now 420 full-time students and twice as many part-timers. A tenth of the students come from the EU, notably Germany and Italy. A further 5% come from other coun tries overseas. The ACM, a company limited by guarantee, is affiliated to Guildford College. It offers a level three diploma and a level four higher diploma. From next year it will also run a degree in contemporary music, a BA for pop singers validated by Middlesex university. Another new venture it is launching in September is the Pop Academy, aimed at 12-year-olds. In an industry seemingly getting younger by the minute, that is the age for catching tomorrow's pop stars. For four hours on Saturday mornings these teenies will be taught voice, choreography, video performance and . . . image. The academy is not as rigidly selective as some performing arts institutions, but does not run an absolutely open door. There were 600 applicants for the full-time places this year. Everybody is auditioned. \"If you came here wanting a guitar place and you couldn't play the guitar, we wouldn't be able to offer you a place,\" explains Ian Edwards, who teaches guitar. About 80% of the students on the guitar and drums courses are male. The majority on the vocal courses is female. In every case the aim over the year is to produce well-rounded professionals who will slot into the pop and rock industry. \"We don't tell people they'll be the next Ronan Keating,\" says Edwards. \"But Ronan Keating has sound and lighting engineers, a record company, a publishing company - all these areas are legitimate jobs for our students.\" Every Thursday, all students must attend three lectures on various aspects of the business of pop music. In its short existence the academy has groomed some promising performers. A recent student landed three world tours on guitar with Boyzone. Lucy Randell, 18, who completed her course in the summer, is in the final four candidates to perform Britain's entry in the Eurovision song contest with a song called Just Another Rainbow. She switched to the academy three months into a Btec in performing arts at Barking College. \"I didn't really click at that.\" Like other students she wanted a course focused on pop. Bruce Dickinson reckons that parents these days are more prepared to countenance pop and rock training as a viable career path for their children. \"We've now got a generation of young people whose parents have got Never Mind The Bollocks by the Sex Pistols in their collections. \"They don't think their kids are aliens for thinking seriously of pop music education.\" There is one problem. \"One of the functions of pop music is to piss off your parents. \"That's difficult for these youngsters with parents listening to the Sex Pistols.\"",

The \u00a32.3bn cost (plus \u00a3680m to abolish dividend taxes) would be found from \u00a38bn savings on public spending, Mr Portillo said.</p> <p>Though the Tory proposal would retain the 40% tax rate on savings, the effect of abolishing both the 22% standard rate of tax and the 10% starter rate for all savers would unavoidably mean larger net benefits to those with a high proportion of savings income.</p> <p>They are typically self-employed people who have retired on capital assets rather than a conventional occupational pension. Around 16m of the likely beneficiaries of the Tory scheme are non-pensioners, mostly on modest incomes. Around 4.7m are re tired, mainly the better off.</p> <p>The move, which the Conservative leader billed as a blow for \"individual independence, institutional freedom and social responsibility\", was endorsed as feasible by analysts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who have been critical of both sides' figures during pre-election skirmishes. The plans reflect Tory attempts to win back older voters - who tend to vote in above-average numbers - and to encourage savings which have slipped by two-thirds as a share of national income since 1997.</p> <p>The Tory plan would also end what Mr Portillo denounced as \"one of the greatest injustices of the tax system\" - that people who have saved out of taxed income are then taxed a second time on the income generated by their savings, which have also been subjected to corporation tax.</p> <p>The proposal would create a tax revolution in \"a Britain where the overwhelming majority of people who have already paid tax on the income they earn, do not then have to pay tax again when they save that income and earn interest on it\", Mr Hague said.</p> <p>Under the Tory scheme, a pensioner on the basic rate of tax with \u00a310,000 invested in an ordinary building society account would benefit by \u00a3120 in the first year, rising to \u00a3740 if they kept their money in for five years. For someone with \u00a320,000 in the bank, the gains would be \u00a3240 and \u00a31,481 respectively.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservatives stepped up the pressure on Gordon Brown to woo the \"grey power\" electorate in next month's Budget when they announced plans to scrap all income tax on the savings and dividends of 20m mainly older voters. Labour immediately claimed the Tory plans would give only around \u00a3100 a year to most people affected, but would disproportionately benefit the better off, giving an average \u00a31,500 to the top 10%, those with the biggest savings. William Hague and Michael Portillo joined forces to unveil the \u00a33bn proposal, which went further than expected in exempting not just pensioners' savings and dividends but all such savings for lower and middle income groups. It would leave only higher rate taxpayers - with incomes above \u00a332,785- paying income tax on savings. The \u00a32.3bn cost (plus \u00a3680m to abolish dividend taxes) would be found from \u00a38bn savings on public spending, Mr Portillo said. Though the Tory proposal would retain the 40% tax rate on savings, the effect of abolishing both the 22% standard rate of tax and the 10% starter rate for all savers would unavoidably mean larger net benefits to those with a high proportion of savings income. They are typically self-employed people who have retired on capital assets rather than a conventional occupational pension. Around 16m of the likely beneficiaries of the Tory scheme are non-pensioners, mostly on modest incomes. Around 4.7m are re tired, mainly the better off. The move, which the Conservative leader billed as a blow for \"individual independence, institutional freedom and social responsibility\", was endorsed as feasible by analysts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, who have been critical of both sides' figures during pre-election skirmishes. The plans reflect Tory attempts to win back older voters - who tend to vote in above-average numbers - and to encourage savings which have slipped by two-thirds as a share of national income since 1997. The Tory plan would also end what Mr Portillo denounced as \"one of the greatest injustices of the tax system\" - that people who have saved out of taxed income are then taxed a second time on the income generated by their savings, which have also been subjected to corporation tax. The proposal would create a tax revolution in \"a Britain where the overwhelming majority of people who have already paid tax on the income they earn, do not then have to pay tax again when they save that income and earn interest on it\", Mr Hague said. Under the Tory scheme, a pensioner on the basic rate of tax with \u00a310,000 invested in an ordinary building society account would benefit by \u00a3120 in the first year, rising to \u00a3740 if they kept their money in for five years. For someone with \u00a320,000 in the bank, the gains would be \u00a3240 and \u00a31,481 respectively.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>TO HULL AND BACK</strong></p> <p>At 6.30 this morning, two white vans with Mul-T-Lock emblazoned on their flanks pulled up outside Hull City's Boothferry Park ground. Doing, we presume, what Mul-T-Lock does best, the van drivers then shut up the ground with padlocks, preventing anyone from getting in until the landlord, former Davis Cup captain David Lloyd, gets the \u00a345,000 he's owed in rent. This would be a bit of a bind, even if Hull weren't 24 hours away from facing a winding-up order for \u00a3230,000 of unpaid taxes. Which, of course, they are.</p> <p>Hull's current chairman is a Mr Nick Buchanan, and he was not impressed by this morning's activities. \"I think someone is running to a personal agenda here and I don't think they realise they are not hurting Nick Buchanan,\" said Nick Buchanan. \"They are hurting Hull City FC.\" However, debate rages (does it ever do anything else?) as to who exactly is hurting the club. After all, in his two years in charge of Hull, Mr Buchanan has presided over an increase in the club's debt from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a31.5m, despite the club turning an operating profit in the year 1998-99, and despite healthy average crowds of around 6,000.</p> <p>While the fraud squad conducts an inquiry into off-the-field activities at the club, rumours abound as to where the money's gone. Buchanan claims it's all down to a \"top-heavy\" wage structure. Most fans, meanwhile, prefer to blame Mr Buchanan and former vice-chairman Stephen Hinchliffe (who, after resigning his post at the club, turned out to be banned by the DTI from holding a company directorship). When he can't afford to pay his VAT or his rent, they wonder, how can Mr Buchanan afford to run up a club tab of \u00a35,000 at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant? We phoned Boothferry Park for comment, but there was nobody in the office.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>BLAB DE BILDE</strong></p> <p>Bob the Builder, cartoon star and cash cow of popular north London gadabout Neil Morrissey, is famous for preaching the virtues of \"working together\" to \"get the job done\". But his irritating little brother, Sheffield Wednesday striker Gilles, takes a more self-centred approach. Unhappy with \"deplorable\" First Division football, the fist-happy Belgian wants to leave struggling Wednesday immediately, and finds it unacceptable that the club are holding out for some of the \u00a33m they wasted on an international striker who has managed one lower-league goal all season.</p> <p>\"I reached an agreement with Las Palmas but Wednesday wanted too much money,\" whined poor helpless little Gilles, who once attacked Alost defender Krist Porte with his fist, smashing his nose and eye socket into variously sized bits. \"They are destroying me,\" Mr the Builder grizzled on. \"I am not surprised we're bottom. All the players who have left have been replaced by reserves. As a result I can't motivate myself. If they hold me to my contract, I don't know whether I could cope with that.\"</p> <p>The Fiver can only imagine how hard it must be to pick up a fat cheque every week for not being able to hit a cow door from ten yards with an arse banjo. However, club chairman Howard Culley doesn't sympathise. \"The comments beggar belief,\" spluttered Culley this afternoon. \"We had interest from both Aston Villa and Las Palmas - and it is nothing to do with the club's financial demands that they fell through. We want him to be a success and to prejudice that just wouldn't be sensible.\" And as if to prove Wednesday's commitment to their Belgian star's career, Culley then pointed to the latest league tables. Well, it's so much easier to score goals in the Second, isn't it?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Because of all the financial interests at stake, the sport is turning into a mafia.

Hull's current chairman is a Mr Nick Buchanan, and he was not impressed by this morning's activities. \"I think someone is running to a personal agenda here and I don't think they realise they are not hurting Nick Buchanan,\" said Nick Buchanan. \"They are hurting Hull City FC.\" However, debate rages (does it ever do anything else?) as to who exactly is hurting the club. After all, in his two years in charge of Hull, Mr Buchanan has presided over an increase in the club's debt from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a31.5m, despite the club turning an operating profit in the year 1998-99, and despite healthy average crowds of around 6,000. While the fraud squad conducts an inquiry into off-the-field activities at the club, rumours abound as to where the money's gone. Buchanan claims it's all down to a \"top-heavy\" wage structure. Most fans, meanwhile, prefer to blame Mr Buchanan and former vice-chairman Stephen Hinchliffe (who, after resigning his post at the club, turned out to be banned by the DTI from holding a company directorship). When he can't afford to pay his VAT or his rent, they wonder, how can Mr Buchanan afford to run up a club tab of \u00a35,000 at Mr Chu's Chinese restaurant? We phoned Boothferry Park for comment, but there was nobody in the office. * * * * * * * * * * * * * BLAB DE BILDE Bob the Builder, cartoon star and cash cow of popular north London gadabout Neil Morrissey, is famous for preaching the virtues of \"working together\" to \"get the job done\". But his irritating little brother, Sheffield Wednesday striker Gilles, takes a more self-centred approach. Unhappy with \"deplorable\" First Division football, the fist-happy Belgian wants to leave struggling Wednesday immediately, and finds it unacceptable that the club are holding out for some of the \u00a33m they wasted on an international striker who has managed one lower-league goal all season. \"I reached an agreement with Las Palmas but Wednesday wanted too much money,\" whined poor helpless little Gilles, who once attacked Alost defender Krist Porte with his fist, smashing his nose and eye socket into variously sized bits. \"They are destroying me,\" Mr the Builder grizzled on. \"I am not surprised we're bottom. All the players who have left have been replaced by reserves. As a result I can't motivate myself. If they hold me to my contract, I don't know whether I could cope with that.\" The Fiver can only imagine how hard it must be to pick up a fat cheque every week for not being able to hit a cow door from ten yards with an arse banjo. However, club chairman Howard Culley doesn't sympathise. \"The comments beggar belief,\" spluttered Culley this afternoon. \"We had interest from both Aston Villa and Las Palmas - and it is nothing to do with the club's financial demands that they fell through. We want him to be a success and to prejudice that just wouldn't be sensible.\" And as if to prove Wednesday's commitment to their Belgian star's career, Culley then pointed to the latest league tables. Well, it's so much easier to score goals in the Second, isn't it? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Because of all the financial interests at stake, the sport is turning into a mafia. Like all soccer lovers, it makes me sorry\" - Manchester United godfather Eric Cantona stuffs two cotton-wool balls in each cheek and explains why he has turned his back on football. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE DIARY OF ARSENAL'S GEORGE GRAHAM: SECRET AGENT 5am: Awoke from bad dream which involved a ball hitting the back of a net. Twitched uncontrollably. 8.30am: Finally recovered from spasm. Inserted secret transmitter into ear, which allows subliminal pro-Arsenal messages to be received in AM or FM frequencies. 9am: On way to work, noticed thousands of Spurs fans sobbing into their papers. Heh! Realised they'd been reading my Sun interview, where I tell Pat Sheehan: \"I won't walk away from Tottenham.\" Cackle loudly at my warped genius. 12pm: Training. Berated team for making last Saturday's 0-0 draw against Charlton too exciting. Thought about the practicalities of introducing a 9-1-0 formation, until HQ warned me it might blow my cover. Consider appointing Stefan Freund club captain instead. 12.01pm: Given the Heinlich manoeuvre by office staff after suffering laughing fit. 2pm: Phoned Norris McWhirter to ask whether a fifth consecutive 0-0 draw would make the Guinness Book of Records. Got over disappointing news by shouting at Ian Walker during a crisis meeting at the club's Chigwell training ground. He's now thinking of leaving. Not for Highbury, I hope. 4pm: Prepared supporters for inevitable defeat against Charlton in FA Cup tomorrow. \"There are other clubs as big as Tottenham who can't win the championship, can't qualify for [Big Cup] and who are not in either cup,\" I smiled, while cleverly blaming my long injury list for Spurs' poor run of form. 5pm: Noticed that everybody's morale is at rock bottom. Left the ground contemplating a job well done. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Everton have confirmed reports that they will be taking Argentinian defender Pablo Paz on trial, with a view to a permanent move. \"He is still coming over for a few days training, where we will have a look at him and see where we go from there,\" said manager Walter Smith. Sol Campbell tops Bayern Munich's summer shopping list, according to reports in Germany. Bayer Leverkusen are tracking Arsenal goalkeeper Alex Manninger. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Fifa and Uefa have repeated their demand that players should only be allowed to move once a year if the EU decide to scrap the current transfer system. At a joint meeting today, Fifa head Sepp Blatter and Uefa president Lennart Johansson also agreed to present a united front at meetings with the EU commission on February 14 and 16. Paul Taylor, the referee accused of making insulting remarks towards Notts County's Sean Farrell, has been \"completely exonerated\" by the FA, according to Premier League referees' spokesman Keith Cooper. Cooper's comments followed a four-hour FA hearing today, which found the misconduct charge against Taylor had been \"not proven\". Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has called for a smaller Big Cup with only one group stage instead of two. \"Thirteen games instead of 17 would be enough,\" said Beckenbauer. \"After the first group stage we should go straight into the knockout phase with the round of eight.\" Leicester City have paid Altrincham \u00a350,000 for winger Kevin Ellison. Burnley have made an enquiry about Coventry striker John Aloisi. Manager Stan Ternent told Burnley's official website: \"If we can afford him then I will speak to the player to see if he fancies the move. He will definitely strengthen the squad.\" Jaap Stam could sign a new contract at Manchester United within the next few weeks, according to his agent Ton van Dalen. St Mirren have signed French striker Moussa Dagnogo in time for tonight's CIS Insurance Cup semi-final against Kilmarnock. The following matches have been called off due to bad weather: Northampton Town v Swansea, Rochdale v Brighton, Cheltenham v York, Shrewsbury v Kidderminster, Aberdeen v Dundee United, Queen of the South v Airdrie, Dunfermline v St Johnstone, and Falkirk v Dundee. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Scottish and Grampian: Live Scotsport Special - St Mirren v Kilmarnock (7.30pm) \"Allo, guv'nor!

      "bodyText": "Waiting lists for NHS hospital treatment increased by more than 13,000 patients in December despite unprecedented government planning to deal with winter pressures, official figures showed today. The number of people waiting for in-patient hospital treatment in England rose by 13,200 to stand at 1,034,400 in the final month of 2000, the Department of Health said. But there was some good news for the government, with a dramatic fall in the number of people waiting for an out-patient appointment. The Tories have claimed that the government's obsession with reducing in-patient numbers has driven more people on to the so-called \"waiting list for the waiting list\". Ministers described the increase as expected and said the winter planning had kept the rise to a \"minimum\". And numbers still remain in line with the government pledge of keeping waiting lists to 100,000 below the 1997 figure they inherited from the Tories. Health minister John Denham said: \"Waiting lists always go up in winter, but this year better planning and more investment have kept increases to a minimum. \"The small rise in the NHS waiting list was expected, and will probably have risen again during January.\" Unprecedented planning and investment went into avoiding another winter crisis in the health service after the crippling problems of the previous year. Every NHS trust was ordered to come up with a plan for easing pressures on hospitals during the winter months. But in December, 10 patients had still been waiting longer than the maximum 18-month target set by the government. And 48,400 had waited more than a year - a rise of more than 600 on the previous month. Ministers have pledged that by 2005, no patient will wait longer than six months, with an eventual three-month maximum by 2008. Labour pledged in its last election manifesto to reduce waiting lists by 100,000 from the figure it inherited from the Conservatives - a target achieved amid much fanfare last year. Despite the December rise, waiting numbers are still 23,623 below that, with ministers hoping that expected rises for January will not jeopardise their success. But many hospitals might have cancelled routine elective surgery to deal with winter problems, meaning waiting lists could increase in the coming months. The shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said: \"This is yet further evidence, if any were needed, that Alan Milburn is incapable of managing even his own flawed policy with any competence.\" \"We now have first-class staff in a second-class service run by third-rate ministers.\" Meanwhile, the number of people waiting more than 13 weeks for an out-patient's appointment - what the Conservatives have called the waiting list for the waiting list - fell by more than 30,000 in the three months to December from 435,768 to 399,137. This fall will be seen as a victory by ministers who have repeatedly faced criticism that the waiting list initiative has distorted clinical priorities and not changed the number of patients actually waiting for treatment.",

The performance of BBC1's much-promoted police drama Second Sight continued to be solid rather than spectacular with an average viewing figure of 5.6m for its 50-minute slot. Elsewhere, Channel 5 got its best viewing figures of the day with its 10pm broadcast of Goodfellas.

Sources at Northern &amp; Shell revealed that Hollinger has already made an offer for the plant and arbitrators could be called in. Hollinger wants to buy Mr Desmond's 50% stake in the lucrative plant, but it has balked at the \u00a380m fee demanded by the OK! publisher's advisers. But insiders at the Express reveal that the \u00a380m-plus valuation was based on a complex financial arrangement agreed by Hollinger and previous Express owner Lord Hollick. The valuation was set down in a pre-determined formula that was agreed between Hollick and Hollinger. And that valuation was north of \u00a380m,\" said one source close to the negotiations. Mr Desmond has taken advice from his solicitors who say the valuation is legally correct. If the price cannot be determined through arbitration, then the sale will have to be settled in court. It is understood that Hollinger, which already owns 50% of Westferry, made an offer to Mr Desmond's Northern &amp; Shell company before Christmas last year. Another offer was made last month which the Express proprietor rejected. Although both sides are keen to resolve the deadlock outside of the courtroom, Mr Desmond is said to be relaxed. \"He is no hurry and will take his time,\" said a source. However, Hollinger vice-chairman Dan Colson has already said that his company is in no hurry to sell the stake and it will take its time before completing a deal.

      "bodyText": "A list of countries and groups from which asylum applications would be \"ruled inadmissible\" should be drawn up to combat Europe's huge influx of refugees, the home secretary, Jack Straw, said today. Giving a key speech on the future of asylum policy, Mr Straw said that certain refugees could either be pushed through a quicker asylum process to save money or excluded from applying altogether, provided the international community could agree to rewrite the 1951 UN convention of refugees. Mr Straw said: \"An EU or internationally agreed list of safe countries or groups from which asylum applications would be ruled inadmissible or considered under a greatly accelerated process ought to be on the agenda.\" He set out the blueprint of an asylum system where people must apply for refugee status while they are still abroad, rather than after travelling to the UK. Such a set-up could counter the problems of illegal immigration and people trafficking, but will cause an outcry from human rights groups who fearthat genuine refugees fleeing persecution could be denied their only chance of safety. The proposals in Mr Straw's speech were immediately condemned as \"dangerous\" by some audience members at a left-wing think-tank conference on the future of asylum. The home secretary added: \"The UK will want to play a full part in the developing debate on all these ideas, but it is clear that completing the reform of the domestic system will provide the essential platform from which more radical longer-term ideas can be considered. \"Any moves towards the implementation of ideas for processing of claims overseas or substantial resettlement programmes will have to be in parallel with driving down the numbers of unfounded applications.\" The toughening stance on asylum - part of a multi-pronged attack on the issue by the government this week - signals the important role the issue will play in the forthcoming general election. Asylum applications reached an all-time high of more than 76,000 last year. Mr Straw called for a wide-ranging revamp of the convention, which governs countries' responsibilities to asylum seekers. He said: \"Would-be migrants are taking advantage of one aspect of the convention - namely that it places an obligation on states to consider any application for asylum made on their territory, however ill-founded.\" He continued: \"The UK has a proud history of offering shelter to those fleeing persecution. Yet the convention is no longer working as its framers intended.\" Addressing the conference called Modernising Asylum organised by the Institute for Public Policy Research at Lincoln's Inn Fields, central London, Mr Straw also backed the idea of a resettlement programme for refugees who would be identified in their own regions before being brought back to the EU and divided among member states by a quota system. Elaborating on how the list of \"safe countries\" would be devised, he said it would be broken into three categories. The first would include countries like the US or Canada, from where \"no applications for asylum should be entertained\", while the final category would feature oppressive states where asylum seekers would be considered automatically. In the middle would be a group of countries - which he did not define but said would include China - where, \"by agreed criteria, the presumption is that the application would be unfounded\" if it was made in the receiving state. Sarah Spencer, of the IPPR, said: \"This proposal alarms me the most and I think it could be very dangerous. \"The volatility of a political situation on the ground can change so quickly, an EU list of so-called safe countries would always be out of date. The chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, Gurbux Singh, said: \"I did not get the impression that the issues had been fully thought through and there were some real question marks about the practicality of what he was proposing. \"For example, I do not know whether the proposal to make assessments of asylum seekers in their own countries is actually workable.\" Related articles How to claim asylum An A-Z of asylum seekers The main parties' positions on asylum seekers 06.02.2001: Straw wants to toughen asylum rules 04.02.2001: Tony Blair and Italian counterpart Guiliano Amato write for the Observer 06.02.2001: Asylum seekers to be 'sent back' 05.02.2001: Grim war on human traffickers 28.01.2001: Bosnia's corrupt elite grow fat on human cargo smuggled to West 28.01.2001: People trade makes Bosnia rich Interactive guide Seeking asylum: who, where and why?

They are that all four defendants entered into an illegal agreement with Bin Laden to kill Americans anywhere in the world. Each helped the best they could, and 224 men, women and children lost their lives.\"</p> <p>The four men, two of whom face the death penalty if convicted of direct involvement in the bombings of the embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in August 1998, were led into court with their hands cuffed behind their backs and their feet shackled.</p> <p>Outside, a fork-lift truck rearranged blocks of concrete in front of metal barriers at the entrance to the the old federal courthouse in Manhattan. Two hydraulically operated steel barricades were placed across a road running alongside, designed to halt a truck travelling at 50mph. Cameras with night vision and capable of reading a newspaper a block away monitored the area.</p> <p>Inside courtroom 318, where the trial of those accused of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre was also held, sniffer dogs searched for explosives. Those attending the trial had to pass two sets of metal detectors.</p> <p>\"The bombings were neither the beginning nor the end of a terrorist plot to kill Americans,\" Mr Butler said.\"In the blink of an eye everything changed. What [the bombings] did to human beings that day defies description. Words and numbers cannot describe the horror.\"</p> <p>Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian, is accused of being in the vehicle that carried the Nairobi bomb, and 27-year-old Khalfan Khamis Mohammed, from Tanzania, is accused of being in the truck that contained the explosives in Dar es Salaam.</p> <p>The other two, said to have been involved in the wider conspiracy, face life in jail if convicted. They are Wadih el-Hage, a 40-year-old American citizen born in the Lebanon and said to have been Mr Bin Laden's personal secretary, and MohamedSaddiq Odeh, a Jordanian, 35, who is accused of running a fishing business to support the group in Kenya. They plead not guilty.</p> <p>The prosecution is expected to use contested confessions, and computer and telephone records in the course of the trial, which could last up to a year. Whittling down the jury to 12 members and six alternates from a pool of 1,300 took a month in itself.</p> <p>In all, 22 men have been charged with involvement in the conspiracy to kill Americans: the four on trial in Manhattan, another who will face the court later, one who has pleaded guilty and is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution, three who are fighting extradition from the United Kingdom, and 13 who remain at large, including Mr Bin Laden. He is believed to be in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Ali Mohammed, a naturalised American from Egypt who has admitted taking part in the plot, told an earlier hearing that he had been sent by Mr Bin Laden to scout the US embassy in Nairobi. \"Bin Laden looked at the picture of the embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,\" he said.</p> <p>Another man who will testify against the four is known only as CS-1. The man, believed to be a convicted terrorist, says he worked for Mr Bin Laden until five years ago.</p> <p>Robert Precht, who was a lawyer for one of the defendants in the World Trade Centre trial, said outside the court yesterday: \"In this trial the mastermind [of the plot] has already been manufactured by the extensive press coverage, the attacks by politicians on Bin Laden, and even the public statements and military actions of former President [Bill] Clinton.</p> <p>\"To the extent that Bin Laden has become a focal point, he becomes a ready-made mastermind for the defence,\" he said.</p> <p><b>In the dock: the accused</b></p> <p><b> Khalfan Khamis Mohammed</b><br> <b> Age 27, from Tanzania</b></p> <p>Sometimes called \"KK\", he is accused of riding in the bomb-laden truck to the embassy in Tanzania. He was detained in South Africa in October 1999, and faces the death penalty. He allegedly rented a house as the bomb factory.</p> <p><b> Wahid el-Hage </b><br> <b> Age 40, from Texas</b></p> <p>Born in Lebanon, said to be Osama bin Laden's former secretary. Raised a Roman Catholic, he converted to Islam. In the late 70s he attended the University of South-western Louisiana. In 1992 he went to work for Bin Laden in Sudan and Kenya. The father of seven, he was back in Texas by 199. He now says he is a college freshman living in the 70s and can't remember his family.</p> <p><b> Mohamed Saddiq Odeh</b><br> <b> Age 35, from Jordan</b></p> <p>Arrested days after the Nairobi bombing when he tried to enter Pakistan. Alleged to have said he went to Kenya for five days before the attacks and met an explosives expert who led the Kenyan terrorism cell. Prosecutors say he stayed with other group members at the Hilltop Hotel in Kenya, before travelling on August 5 to meet Osama bin Laden. They said he told them that all the plotters except one had left Kenya a day before the attack, shaving their beards to avoid suspicion. He has a wife and child in Jordan.</p> <p><b> Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali </b><br> <b> Age 24, from Saudi Arabia</b></p> <p>Arrested five days after the bombing in Nairobi, he was interviewed extensively by the FBI. Prosecutors say he denied having a role but changed his story, saying he rode in the truck and threw a stun grenade at guards. Allegedly he discarded two keys to the padlock of the vehicle at a hospital. He says his confession was coerced. If convicted he could be executed.</p>",

Outside, a fork-lift truck rearranged blocks of concrete in front of metal barriers at the entrance to the the old federal courthouse in Manhattan. Two hydraulically operated steel barricades were placed across a road running alongside, designed to halt a truck travelling at 50mph. Cameras with night vision and capable of reading a newspaper a block away monitored the area. Inside courtroom 318, where the trial of those accused of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre was also held, sniffer dogs searched for explosives. Those attending the trial had to pass two sets of metal detectors. \"The bombings were neither the beginning nor the end of a terrorist plot to kill Americans,\" Mr Butler said.\"In the blink of an eye everything changed. What [the bombings] did to human beings that day defies description. Words and numbers cannot describe the horror.\" Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, a 24-year-old Saudi Arabian, is accused of being in the vehicle that carried the Nairobi bomb, and 27-year-old Khalfan Khamis Mohammed, from Tanzania, is accused of being in the truck that contained the explosives in Dar es Salaam. The other two, said to have been involved in the wider conspiracy, face life in jail if convicted. They are Wadih el-Hage, a 40-year-old American citizen born in the Lebanon and said to have been Mr Bin Laden's personal secretary, and MohamedSaddiq Odeh, a Jordanian, 35, who is accused of running a fishing business to support the group in Kenya. They plead not guilty. The prosecution is expected to use contested confessions, and computer and telephone records in the course of the trial, which could last up to a year. Whittling down the jury to 12 members and six alternates from a pool of 1,300 took a month in itself. In all, 22 men have been charged with involvement in the conspiracy to kill Americans: the four on trial in Manhattan, another who will face the court later, one who has pleaded guilty and is expected to be a star witness for the prosecution, three who are fighting extradition from the United Kingdom, and 13 who remain at large, including Mr Bin Laden. He is believed to be in Afghanistan. Ali Mohammed, a naturalised American from Egypt who has admitted taking part in the plot, told an earlier hearing that he had been sent by Mr Bin Laden to scout the US embassy in Nairobi. \"Bin Laden looked at the picture of the embassy and pointed to where a truck could go as a suicide bomber,\" he said. Another man who will testify against the four is known only as CS-1. The man, believed to be a convicted terrorist, says he worked for Mr Bin Laden until five years ago. Robert Precht, who was a lawyer for one of the defendants in the World Trade Centre trial, said outside the court yesterday: \"In this trial the mastermind [of the plot] has already been manufactured by the extensive press coverage, the attacks by politicians on Bin Laden, and even the public statements and military actions of former President [Bill] Clinton. \"To the extent that Bin Laden has become a focal point, he becomes a ready-made mastermind for the defence,\" he said. In the dock: the accused Khalfan Khamis Mohammed Age 27, from Tanzania Sometimes called \"KK\", he is accused of riding in the bomb-laden truck to the embassy in Tanzania. He was detained in South Africa in October 1999, and faces the death penalty. He allegedly rented a house as the bomb factory. Wahid el-Hage Age 40, from Texas Born in Lebanon, said to be Osama bin Laden's former secretary. Raised a Roman Catholic, he converted to Islam. In the late 70s he attended the University of South-western Louisiana. In 1992 he went to work for Bin Laden in Sudan and Kenya. The father of seven, he was back in Texas by 199. He now says he is a college freshman living in the 70s and can't remember his family. Mohamed Saddiq Odeh Age 35, from Jordan Arrested days after the Nairobi bombing when he tried to enter Pakistan. Alleged to have said he went to Kenya for five days before the attacks and met an explosives expert who led the Kenyan terrorism cell. Prosecutors say he stayed with other group members at the Hilltop Hotel in Kenya, before travelling on August 5 to meet Osama bin Laden. They said he told them that all the plotters except one had left Kenya a day before the attack, shaving their beards to avoid suspicion. He has a wife and child in Jordan. Mohammed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali Age 24, from Saudi Arabia Arrested five days after the bombing in Nairobi, he was interviewed extensively by the FBI. Prosecutors say he denied having a role but changed his story, saying he rode in the truck and threw a stun grenade at guards. Allegedly he discarded two keys to the padlock of the vehicle at a hospital. He says his confession was coerced. If convicted he could be executed.",

He also denied that the shift to BBC2 signalled a further marginalisation of BBC arts programming. \"I would say we are putting arts closer to the centre of the BBC's activities than it has been for several years,\" Mr Keating said. \"There will be more investment and more output that will be better scheduled and promoted more heavily. \"It means Omnibus can tackle a richer range of subjects than has been possible on BBC1.\" Mr Keating said this week's BBC1 Omnibus on Nancy Mitford, accompanying the new BBC1 adaptation of her comic novels, was a good example of the kind of documentary that would continue to go out on the mass audience channel. By contrast, upcoming BBC2 editions of Omnibus will cover subjects including Italian painter Botticelli. In the next run of the documentary strand, two episodes would go out on BBC1 and six on BBC2, Mr Keating said. \"I don't know what the exact split will be in future - my view is you've got to be pragmatic.\" Mr Keating said the new Saturday night arts slot between 7 and 9pm \"was the best place to get viewers coming to these kind of programmes\". He added: \"We're going from an intermittent 90-minute slot on Sunday to a 40-week a year commitment to two hours on Saturday.\" The move follows criticism that heavyweight programmes such as Panorama and arts shows were being pushed out of primetime on BBC1 to enable the station compete better with ITV. Last year culture secretary Chris Smith expressed concern at plans to switch current affairs and arts programmes such as Panorama and Omnibus from BBC1 to other channels. He was also alarmed at plans by the BBC to \"undermine the rich mix\" of shows on BBC1 by switching some of its long-running programmes to BBC2. Relevant story Feb 6: BBC2 slot for Omnibus",

Driving home after dining out with friends, he'd seen the burning car surrounded by onlookers, fire fighters and police, but could never have imagined what the scene signified. \"I just thought there'd been an accident,\" he says. \"Then I realised I was seeing exactly the same thing on my television screen, with Jeremy Paxman explaining what was really going on - almost literally on my doorstep.\" </p> <p>From Father Gary's garden gate you get a view of where the paedophile-purgers of the Paulsgrove estate got into their stride. A municipal green slopes down from the front of St Michael and All Angels church until it meets Allaway Avenue, with its promenade of shops and the local housing office of Portsmouth city council. Facing this stands the second-floor flat where Victor Burnett, 55, used to live, and which he had vacated only hours before a group of his neighbours wanted him out. </p> <p>There'd been mutterings about Burnett since he'd moved in two years ago. But after he became one of the convicted child sex offenders \"named and shamed\" by the News of the World following the death of Sarah Payne, and after further coverage in the local press, the mutterings turned into howls of hate. Placards were brandished, missiles thrown and a police officer injured. At one point a woman, thought to have been Burnett's sister, came on the scene. Her car was turned over and torched. </p> <p>On the same day, August 3, that the News of the World bowed to pressure to stop naming and shaming, the paedophile story got fresh legs. Paulsgrove was the place where it ran. Seven months later it is still running. It took a week for Paulsgrove's dispensers of unofficial justice to extend it to a dozen or so other residents of their own or the adjoining Wymering estate, and, in the process, get the media goggling, the politicians flapping and parents everywhere worrying about predatory \"perverts\" lurking down their way. </p> <p>By contrast, the forces of conventional authority have had a lengthier task. The wheels of law and order are still turning. Fifty people were arrested during the period of the protests, 39 of whom were charged. Most of these have come before magistrates in recent weeks: the minor cases have been dealt with, the more serious will go to crown court later in the year. Meanwhile, at ground level, fears have had to be stilled and scars healed. </p> <p>\"It could have happened anywhere,\" Father Gary says as he takes me on a tour through Paulsgrove. It's not urban unrest country. Paulsgrove does not bloom with affluence, but nor does it reek of decay. Sixty per cent of its properties are owner-occupied and early residents, called \"Grovers\", maintain a pioneering spirit. Theirs, though, was not the sort of solidarity paraded by the \"perv-hunters\". </p> <p>Councillor David Horne, a resident of Paulsgrove for 36 years, describes how \"the whole estate was touched by it. If they didn't see it for themselves, they saw it on the news every night. There were lots of terrified people asking each other 'are they going to come down my street next?' Most people look on the protesters with nothing but contempt. You could say the community has united against them. Most of all, they would just like to forget.\" </p> <p>The council remains engaged in social fabric surgery. Rob Hutchinson, director of Portsmouth social services, says: \"We've got into a closer dialogue with the community; a respectable community which is articulating itself in a way that it hasn't done before. The established local groups like the tenants associations, and more recently the protesters, have been contributing in a responsible and sensible way.\" </p> <p>But getting to this stage has not been easy. The problem was establishing a dialogue with the protest organisers - Residents Against Paedophiles, as they are known - with their mobile-phone networks, business cards and mob which trailed in their wake. And once the protests were called off came the long slog of reconstruction. A \"Keep Safe\" programme has been running in the schools, and last month a Paulsgrove primary hosted the launch of council-funded child protection awareness sessions. </p> <p>Hutchinson and others have also offered reassurance that the system designed to protect the public against paedophiles works. He stresses that following previous expressions of concern, Burnett had been the subject of two public protection conferences involving social services, probation staff and the police - the standard procedure. The conclusion of both assessments was that, despite his previous record, there was no evidence that Burnett was going back to his old ways. As for the others who attracted Rap's attentions, the authorities are certain that none posed a threat. Up to 20 people were screened by social services, the probation service and the police. Of these, some had no criminal record, no charges pending, nor even any previously recorded allegation of criminal activity. Others did have convictions, of which some were for sexual offences. But these were not against young children and, in one case, had been committed many years ago with no subsequent reoffending. </p> <p>In short, all the protesters' targets subsequent to Burnett were victims of rumour, gossip and, in some cases, sheer spite. Nor were those besieged and terrorised inside their homes the only victims, according to Superintendent Bob Golding who was in charge of policing: \"There are the children who witnessed the demos or took part; some of them were only four or five years old. Then there were others in the area, intimidated by what was happening and too scared to speak out.\" </p> <p>The legacy of bloodlust may be hardest to erase. Most of those who had their collars felt were just boy rowdies, out for fun. But it's the images of women and their children marching through the night that stick most in the mind: infants toting cardboard coffins, mothers chanting hate. It may have been triggered by a combination of local circumstances and national news events. But Paulsgrove still came to represent with terrible vividness a mood of fear and loathing in the national psyche. </p> <p>If the leading lights of Rap are anything to go by, that mood may rise again. Among the most vocal was Katrina Kessell, 33-year-old lone mother of five, and a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Her credentials as a mother took a knock at the height of the protests when her three-year-old son was found wandering alone while she was off venting her ire. Kessell, though, is undaunted. \"My mum was looking after him, and she's disabled. He hadn't gone very far; he was looking for the policeman he'd met the night before who'd shown him how to use a camcorder.\" She regrets the violence, but not being fined \u00a360 last Monday for, as she puts it, \"shouting me mouth off in the street\". </p> <p>She sticks by her assertion that only the undeserving got the doorstep treatment: \"We checked them all out properly, we had people down the library looking back through the newspapers.\" She says the longer-term benefits are clear.

      "body": "<p>An Effective Protection Regime for the Twenty-first Century</p> <p>Speech to IPPR, 6 February 2001</p> <p>By the Home Secretary, Rt Hon Jack Straw MP</p> <p>1.Ten days ago, I sat in Westminster Central Hall with the Prime Minister, the Prince of Wales and hundreds of others to mark the first UK Holocaust Memorial Day. On the fifty-sixth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, it gave us cause to remember Europe's efforts in the war's aftermath to make sure that such suffering never took place again.</p> <p>2.Those post-war efforts culminated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including a right to seek political asylum. The 1951 UN Convention on Refugees gave that right legal statement.</p> <p>3.In this, the Convention's fiftieth anniversary year, we celebrate the right to asylum. The UK has a proud history of offering shelter to those fleeing persecution. We, the whole of the EU, USA and Canada, and many other countries around the world, are committed to maintaining that tradition and to meeting our obligations under the Convention.</p> <p>4.Yet the Convention is no longer working as its framers intended.</p> <p>5.The environment in which it is applied today is one that has changed almost out of all recognition from that of 1951. Numbers of asylum seekers have vastly increased.</p> <p>6.As a result, the current system is failing many refugees, while at the same time putting huge pressure on receiving nations - not just Western states, but also developing countries which host large numbers of the world's displaced persons.</p> <p>7.The time has therefore come for the Convention's signatories to re-examine its operation, with a view to making it work as it was intended - to relieve the suffering of genuine refugees.</p> <p><b>The problem</b></p> <p>8.The Convention was designed for an era when international flows of people were on a much smaller scale than they are today. Intercontinental travel was rare, difficult and expensive.</p> <p>9.Fifty years on, the world has been transformed. New technology, global communications and cheap international travel have all contributed to a world where rapid, long-distance migration is a realistic option - and a widespread aspiration.</p> <p>10.This is creating new pressures on every part of our immigration system - not least that part which deals with claims for asylum. In particular, thousands of would-be migrants are taking advantage of one aspect of the Convention - namely, that it places an obligation on States to consider any application for asylum made on their territory, however ill-founded.</p> <p>11.The statistics speak for themselves. Whilst the potential for large-scale economic migration has expanded, so too the number of people affected by political upheaval has risen. Civil war and internal oppression continue to make conditions difficult in many countries. As a consequence, the number of displaced persons has increased massively.</p> <p>12. Up until 1988, the UK received around 4,000 asylum applications a year. With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the Iron Curtain, the imploding of the economies of Eastern Europe, and civil and cross border wars in the Balkans, Iraq and Iran, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and elsewhere, numbers rose ten fold in the space of three years. However, investment in staff and IT in the Home Office lagged badly behind this surge for a decade. In 2000, 76,000 applications were made and the majority of initial decisions taken during the year resulted in refusals of both asylum and exceptional leave. About 80% of appeals are unsuccessful. Other EU countries have also seen large increases in asylum applicants, many of whom do not qualify for any form of protection. Despite our increases, we remain 7th in the per capita league table.</p> <p>13. And, since the Convention places no obligation on states to facilitate access to their territory for those in need of protection, many well founded refugees as well as those with no serious claim resort to people-smuggling and other methods of illegal entry in order to access the protection that they need.</p> <p>14. Taken together, these two trends - of increasing economic migration, and increasing numbers of displaced persons - mean that we are faced with a situation where too much effort and resources are being expended on dealing with unfounded claims for asylum, and not enough on helping those in need of protection.</p> <p><b>A way forward?</b></p> <p>15. So how can we make the international protection regime work better?</p> <p>16. First, let me repeat that the UK - and all other signatory States - must meet their basic obligations under the 1951 Convention. That obviously includes giving sanctuary to Convention refugees who arrive at our shores.</p> <p>17. But our obligations go beyond that.</p> <p>18. Refugees have a right to expect that their claims will be assessed quickly and fairly; and that they will be integrated into our society.</p> <p>19. But refugees and the public also have a right to expect that there will be a quick and effective process in place for identifying those who make unfounded claims for asylum.</p> <p>20. We have achieved a good deal in the last 12 months in striving to reach these goals. The backlog is down. Decisions are up. Applications are being processed more swiftly. We are taking positive action to help recognised refugees feel that they belong in their new home. All of us I hope recognise and appreciate the contribution which many refugees are making to our society, through their work and their culture.</p> <p>21. We have worked hard to improve on our domestic processes over the last three and a half years. But we have also helped to lead a much more active European Union wide agenda, for what is a shared European problem. At the European Union Heads of State meeting in Tampere in 1999, the Member States committed themselves to building a Common European Asylum System.</p> <p>22. The UK is at the forefront in driving forward European action in this area. Later this week, Barbara Roche and I will be in Stockholm for the informal meeting of EU justice and home affairs ministers. We will be focussing on asylum and on combating people smuggling and trafficking. I will use the meeting to call for real results by the end of this year on some of the key measures which will set up a Common European Asylum System - on asylum procedures, reception conditions for asylum seekers, and the replacement of the Dublin Convention.</p> <p>23. We will also emphasise the importance of tackling people smuggling and trafficking particularly through the Western Balkans. The Prime Minister and the Italian Prime Minister (Amato) wrote jointly in the Observer and Corriera della Sera this weekend of the need for strong action against traffickers. Our EU partners are fully signed up to working with us to combat trafficking through the Western Balkans. We expect most of them to attend a planning meeting we are hosting in London next Monday.</p> <p>24. And on Friday, the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and I will be meeting our French opposite numbers in Cahors in France at the Franco-British Summit. We will use this meeting to press the case for enhanced co-operation between us to combat the problem of illegal immigration from France to the UK, including problems associated with the Eurostar service.</p> <p>25. All this shows how we are working actively with our European partners to find solutions to the challenges we face.</p> <p>26. Important however as our domestic procedures are and important as consistent standards in EU Member States are, they are not enough by themselves to resolve the difficulties we face. To do that we need to take a step back and look at the wider picture.</p> <p>27. That is what I began to do in my speech in Lisbon last June, when I set out some ideas for creating a more rational and effective protection regime. Today I want to develop my thinking a little further.</p> <p>28. It seems to me that the international community must, collectively, do at least three things better than it is doing now:</p> <p>29. First, we must help the countries concerned to make conditions in the regions of origin better;</p> <p>30. Second, we must make it easier for genuine refugees to access the protection regimes of Europe and other Western States, for example by making their journeys less hazardous;</p> <p>31. Third, we must ensure that those who are not refugees are dissuaded from seeking to benefit unjustly from the terms of the 1951 Convention.</p> <p>32. Let me take each of these briefly in turn.</p> <p><b>Conditions in regions of origin</b></p> <p>33. The great majority of the world's refugees are forced to live in areas neighbouring their homeland. It follows that the main focus of the international community's protection efforts should be on these areas.</p> <p>34. Most refugees want nothing more than to return safely to their own country. They have the best chance of doing that if they are able to stay in safety and dignity in a place as close as possible to home, until such time as it is safe to go back.</p> <p>35. This was the principle behind the concerted EU effort to help refugees from the Kosovan conflict. The overwhelming majority of displaced people were looked after across the border in neighbouring Macedonia. Those in particularly need were given temporary protection in the UK and other EU member states as apart of the Kosovo Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Co-ordinated joint action between EU Member States, UNHCR and other agencies meant that many evacuees did not have to flee hundreds of miles to find safety. They were able to return home when it was safe for them to do so and did not have to get embroiled with the criminal traffickers.</p> <p>36. Yet current spending patterns do not seem to reflect the priority of protection in the regions. On one estimate, about $10 billion is spent annually by developed countries in assessing claims for refugee status, most of which are rejected. But those same countries give only $1 billion a year to UNHCR, the main provider of protection to the millions of displaced persons in the regions of origin.</p> <p>37. Money is not a panacea, and I am not saying that more money spent in these areas would provide a miracle cure. But I am saying that the balance of effort is wrong.</p> <p>38. The international community now needs to get together and consider what might be done to redress this imbalance. This is not something the UK can do alone. It is not even something which the EU can do by itself. Instead it requires both the funders and the funded to come together to discuss a way forward.</p> <p>39. Action in the regions of origin will reduce the pressure on refugees to travel further afield in search of protection.</p> <p>40. But I do not pretend that all such movement can be brought to an end. There remains the question of how refugees can reach safety in the developed world if help cannot be provided more locally.</p> <p><b>Resettlement programme?</b></p> <p>41. Some may say that the increased use of visas and the imposition of penalties on carriers is the main barrier preventing refugees from reaching safety, and that the answer is therefore to end these policies. I disagree.</p> <p>42. Remove measures such as these and we risk an unacceptable rise in uncontrolled economic migration of people seeking to gain entry by making unfounded asylum claims. That would put intolerable pressure on our assessment processes and risk bringing the Convention into dispute.</p> <p>43. Neither governments nor their publics within Europe and beyond would find this acceptable. We are all committed to the Convention and all wish to see it operate effectively. At the same time, we have a duty to operate immigration policies for the benefit of our communities.</p> <p>44. So we need other ideas - ideas which enable us to consider asylum claims in the region of origin.</p> <p>45. One option would be for the EU to set up a resettlement programme, under which an agreed number of refugees - and possibly others in need of protection - would be identified in their own regions and brought to the EU for resettlement. The European Commission has stated, in its November paper on a common EU asylum system, that it will be carrying out feasibility studies on such a programme.</p> <p>46. I can see potential advantages in such a scheme. The Humanitarian Evacuation Programme from Kosovo I referred to earlier showed how a proactive and co-ordinated EU response could help address a serious protection crisis. That Programme provided temporary protection and gives some useful pointers as to how other programmes for resettlement could contribute to a more orderly and effective international protection system.</p> <p>47. Equally, there are serious issues to consider such as the cost and scale of any programme, how those selected for resettlement would be allocated to individual Member States, and what the criteria for selection would be. In assessing this, the Commission can draw on the experiences of countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia. The UK will play a constructive part in the Commission's work.</p> <p>48. It will also be necessary for the EU to fit any procedures for assessing asylum claims overseas into the wider picture. We need to ensure that such external procedures are matched by domestic EU procedures which deal with unfounded asylum claims more speedily than is the case at present. We would also want to see more applications lodged from overseas leading to fewer claims being made within the EU.</p> <p>49. The aim of my speech in Lisbon was to highlight the inconsistencies and illogicalities in the current global system for the protection of refugees. The Commission Communication on Asylum rightly seeks to look at the asylum system as a whole. The UK will want to play a full part in the developing debate on all these ideas but it is clear that completing the reform of the domestic system will provide the essential platform from which more radical longer term ideas can be considered. Any moves towards the implementation of ideas for processing of claims overseas or substantial resettlement programmes will have to be in parallel with driving down the numbers of unfounded applications.</p> <p><b>More effective domestic procedures for weak claims</b></p> <p>50. This leads onto my third area: devising better ways of dealing with those who are not in need of protection but who seek to shelter under the umbrella of the Convention.</p> <p>51. In so doing, these individuals do great damage to asylum systems. They overload the elaborate procedures we have for assessing asylum claims. They cause vast quantities of money to be expended on assessing unfounded claims which might be better spent in the regions of origin. And they can turn the public against genuine refugees.</p> <p>52. There are two main ways of deterring misuse of this kind. The first is to process claims quickly. There is a range of measures which states can implement domestically to address this. However, there are collective measures which I believe could help.</p> <p>53. For example, an EU or internationally-agreed list of safe countries or groups from which asylum applications would be ruled inadmissible or considered under a greatly accelerated process. More generally, the EU's development of common asylum policies should reduce the attractions of so-called \"asylum shopping\".</p> <p>54. The second aspect of deterring unfounded claims is the prompt return of those found not to need protection. The integrity of any asylum process will be undermined if those who make unfounded claims are able to stay.</p> <p>55. I therefore make no apology in highlighting this as a fundamental issue for any protection regime. Everyone who is concerned about the need for international protection should be in favour of an effective system for returning those who do not have such a need. One aspect of this is that countries must document and accept back their nationals who do not qualify for protection elsewhere. We are already working with our European partners to conclude Community readmission agreements with third countries.</p> <p>56. EU States have their particular set of interests on protection issues. Other countries, many of whom provide shelter for the millions of displaced people, have their own set of interests, which might not all be the same as ours. But nor need they be incompatible - all countries have their part to play in meeting the burden of supporting refugees.</p> <p>57. We need to get together so that we can understand each other's perspectives, and move on from there to identifying collective actions which will deliver the effective protection system we all want. UNHCR's global consultations provide us with an excellent opportunity for such a debate.</p> <p><b>Conclusion</b></p> <p>58. Most of us can agree that the international protection regime is not operating as well as it should. We need some radical thinking if we are to ensure that the principles of the 1951 Convention are to be applied effectively in the modern age.</p> <p>59. With the EU looking to move towards a common asylum system, and with UNHCR holding its global consultations exercise, now is the time to have that debate and to find solutions.</p> <p>60. Asylum is an international issue which requires an international response. And the UK is dedicated to playing its full part in trying to develop a better system of protection.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,184656,00.html\">How to claim asylum</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,212675,00.html\">An A-Z of asylum seekers</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,211609,00.html\">The main parties' positions on asylum seekers</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,434185,00.html\">06.02.2001: Straw wants to toughen asylum rules</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,434184,00.html\">04.02.2001: Tony Blair and Italian counterpart Guiliano Amato write for the Observer</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,434169,00.html\">06.02.2001: Asylum seekers to be 'sent back'</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,433627,00.html\">05.02.2001: Grim war on human traffickers</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,430019,00.html\">28.01.2001: Bosnia's corrupt elite grow fat on human cargo smuggled to West</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,430044,00.html\">28.01.2001: People trade makes Bosnia rich</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,5860,334788,00.html\">Seeking asylum: who, where and why?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.ippr.org.uk/ \" target=\"_new\">The Institute for Public Policy Research</a><br><a href=\"http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/o_c_ref.htm\" target=\"_new\">Source document: 1951 UN convention on refugees</a><br><a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The Refugee Council</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jcwi.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.ch/\" target=\"_new\">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hrweb.org/legal/undocs.html\" target=\"_new\">UN human rights declarations: including the Geneva Convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Immigration and Nationality Directorate</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldbills/091/1999091.htm\" target=\"_new\">The immigration and asylum bill</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ukpa.gov.uk/ukpass.htm\" target=\"_new\">UK passports agency</a></p>",

Important however as our domestic procedures are and important as consistent standards in EU Member States are, they are not enough by themselves to resolve the difficulties we face. To do that we need to take a step back and look at the wider picture. 27. That is what I began to do in my speech in Lisbon last June, when I set out some ideas for creating a more rational and effective protection regime. Today I want to develop my thinking a little further. 28. It seems to me that the international community must, collectively, do at least three things better than it is doing now: 29. First, we must help the countries concerned to make conditions in the regions of origin better; 30. Second, we must make it easier for genuine refugees to access the protection regimes of Europe and other Western States, for example by making their journeys less hazardous; 31. Third, we must ensure that those who are not refugees are dissuaded from seeking to benefit unjustly from the terms of the 1951 Convention. 32. Let me take each of these briefly in turn. Conditions in regions of origin 33. The great majority of the world's refugees are forced to live in areas neighbouring their homeland. It follows that the main focus of the international community's protection efforts should be on these areas. 34. Most refugees want nothing more than to return safely to their own country. They have the best chance of doing that if they are able to stay in safety and dignity in a place as close as possible to home, until such time as it is safe to go back. 35. This was the principle behind the concerted EU effort to help refugees from the Kosovan conflict. The overwhelming majority of displaced people were looked after across the border in neighbouring Macedonia. Those in particularly need were given temporary protection in the UK and other EU member states as apart of the Kosovo Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Co-ordinated joint action between EU Member States, UNHCR and other agencies meant that many evacuees did not have to flee hundreds of miles to find safety. They were able to return home when it was safe for them to do so and did not have to get embroiled with the criminal traffickers. 36. Yet current spending patterns do not seem to reflect the priority of protection in the regions. On one estimate, about $10 billion is spent annually by developed countries in assessing claims for refugee status, most of which are rejected. But those same countries give only $1 billion a year to UNHCR, the main provider of protection to the millions of displaced persons in the regions of origin. 37. Money is not a panacea, and I am not saying that more money spent in these areas would provide a miracle cure. But I am saying that the balance of effort is wrong. 38. The international community now needs to get together and consider what might be done to redress this imbalance. This is not something the UK can do alone. It is not even something which the EU can do by itself. Instead it requires both the funders and the funded to come together to discuss a way forward. 39. Action in the regions of origin will reduce the pressure on refugees to travel further afield in search of protection. 40. But I do not pretend that all such movement can be brought to an end. There remains the question of how refugees can reach safety in the developed world if help cannot be provided more locally. Resettlement programme? 41. Some may say that the increased use of visas and the imposition of penalties on carriers is the main barrier preventing refugees from reaching safety, and that the answer is therefore to end these policies. I disagree. 42. Remove measures such as these and we risk an unacceptable rise in uncontrolled economic migration of people seeking to gain entry by making unfounded asylum claims. That would put intolerable pressure on our assessment processes and risk bringing the Convention into dispute. 43. Neither governments nor their publics within Europe and beyond would find this acceptable. We are all committed to the Convention and all wish to see it operate effectively. At the same time, we have a duty to operate immigration policies for the benefit of our communities. 44. So we need other ideas - ideas which enable us to consider asylum claims in the region of origin. 45. One option would be for the EU to set up a resettlement programme, under which an agreed number of refugees - and possibly others in need of protection - would be identified in their own regions and brought to the EU for resettlement. The European Commission has stated, in its November paper on a common EU asylum system, that it will be carrying out feasibility studies on such a programme. 46. I can see potential advantages in such a scheme. The Humanitarian Evacuation Programme from Kosovo I referred to earlier showed how a proactive and co-ordinated EU response could help address a serious protection crisis. That Programme provided temporary protection and gives some useful pointers as to how other programmes for resettlement could contribute to a more orderly and effective international protection system. 47. Equally, there are serious issues to consider such as the cost and scale of any programme, how those selected for resettlement would be allocated to individual Member States, and what the criteria for selection would be. In assessing this, the Commission can draw on the experiences of countries such as the USA, Canada and Australia. The UK will play a constructive part in the Commission's work. 48. It will also be necessary for the EU to fit any procedures for assessing asylum claims overseas into the wider picture. We need to ensure that such external procedures are matched by domestic EU procedures which deal with unfounded asylum claims more speedily than is the case at present. We would also want to see more applications lodged from overseas leading to fewer claims being made within the EU. 49. The aim of my speech in Lisbon was to highlight the inconsistencies and illogicalities in the current global system for the protection of refugees. The Commission Communication on Asylum rightly seeks to look at the asylum system as a whole. The UK will want to play a full part in the developing debate on all these ideas but it is clear that completing the reform of the domestic system will provide the essential platform from which more radical longer term ideas can be considered. Any moves towards the implementation of ideas for processing of claims overseas or substantial resettlement programmes will have to be in parallel with driving down the numbers of unfounded applications. More effective domestic procedures for weak claims 50. This leads onto my third area: devising better ways of dealing with those who are not in need of protection but who seek to shelter under the umbrella of the Convention. 51. In so doing, these individuals do great damage to asylum systems. They overload the elaborate procedures we have for assessing asylum claims. They cause vast quantities of money to be expended on assessing unfounded claims which might be better spent in the regions of origin. And they can turn the public against genuine refugees. 52. There are two main ways of deterring misuse of this kind. The first is to process claims quickly. There is a range of measures which states can implement domestically to address this. However, there are collective measures which I believe could help. 53. For example, an EU or internationally-agreed list of safe countries or groups from which asylum applications would be ruled inadmissible or considered under a greatly accelerated process. More generally, the EU's development of common asylum policies should reduce the attractions of so-called \"asylum shopping\". 54. The second aspect of deterring unfounded claims is the prompt return of those found not to need protection. The integrity of any asylum process will be undermined if those who make unfounded claims are able to stay. 55. I therefore make no apology in highlighting this as a fundamental issue for any protection regime. Everyone who is concerned about the need for international protection should be in favour of an effective system for returning those who do not have such a need. One aspect of this is that countries must document and accept back their nationals who do not qualify for protection elsewhere. We are already working with our European partners to conclude Community readmission agreements with third countries. 56. EU States have their particular set of interests on protection issues. Other countries, many of whom provide shelter for the millions of displaced people, have their own set of interests, which might not all be the same as ours. But nor need they be incompatible - all countries have their part to play in meeting the burden of supporting refugees. 57. We need to get together so that we can understand each other's perspectives, and move on from there to identifying collective actions which will deliver the effective protection system we all want. UNHCR's global consultations provide us with an excellent opportunity for such a debate. Conclusion 58. Most of us can agree that the international protection regime is not operating as well as it should. We need some radical thinking if we are to ensure that the principles of the 1951 Convention are to be applied effectively in the modern age. 59. With the EU looking to move towards a common asylum system, and with UNHCR holding its global consultations exercise, now is the time to have that debate and to find solutions. 60. Asylum is an international issue which requires an international response. And the UK is dedicated to playing its full part in trying to develop a better system of protection.

      "body": "<p>Israelis have gone to the polls today after Ehud Barak's government, elected just 21 months ago, lost majority support in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.</p> <p><b>Why did Barak lose support?</b><br>Presiding over a coalition government, support for Barak was always whimiscal. Elected on a peace platform, he carried out his manifesto pledge to withdraw Israeli troops from Lebanon within his first year of office and also pursued peace with Syria. But support for his government was damaged when his attempts at a peace deal with the Palestinians failed.</p> <p><b>So what went wrong?</b><br>Barak lost support from the Knesset because Jewish Israelis were angered by his pursuit of peace in spite of the increasingly violent intifada. Arab Israelis were also angered by his use of troops to quell the uprising - a decision later condemned by the United Nations. Additionally, his offer to share sovereignty of Jerusalem with the Palestinians annoyed Israeli rightwingers, and ended in failure when it was rejected by Yasser Arafat. Despite winning a confidence vote in the Knesset, Barak called a new election to renew his mandate for peace.</p> <p><b>Who's going to win?</b><br>Barak is expected to be on the end of the heaviest political defeat in Israel's history as Ariel Sharon, leader of the hard right Likud party, and champion of Jewish settlements, is 22 points ahead in the polls. Arab Israelis, who would usually support Barak, are boycotting the election in protest at the killing of 13 young, unarmed Arab Israeli demonstrators by police last year.</p> <p><b>What are the differences in manifestos?</b><br>Both Barak and Sharon are fighting the election on security issues. Barak told voters that they should choose between \"Barak or war\", while at the start of his campaign, Sharon pledged: \"Only I can bring you peace and security and protect Jerusalem. Because I know the Arabs and the Arabs know me.\"</p> <p><b>Where does Sharon's core support come from?</b><br>The religious right backs his Likud party, but Sharon is also expected to receive massive support from the 1m Russian immigrants who now live in Israel. They form 18% of the electorate and their importance has been shown by Sharon's attempts at speeches in Russian. They have also been targeted by TV adverts in Russian. It was this section of the electorate that was credited with bringing Barak to power in 1999, but they have now turned their backs on him. A Russian was the first Israeli citizen killed by the intifada.</p> <p><b>Will a Sharon victory help revive the peace process?</b><br>Probably not. Sharon is hated by the Palestinians due to his past exploits in the army and as defence secretary. In 1953, he led a massacre on Qibya, a Palestinian village, which left 69 villagers dead. Under his command, Israeli troops crossed into Lebanon in 1982 and this led to the massacre of more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees living in Beirut by pro-Israeli Lebanese militia. An Israeli report later found Sharon indirectly responsible for the massacre and recommended that he never be allowed to hold the position of defence secretary again. Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian cabinet minister and senior peace negiotiator, said: \"It does not look like he is the man who would push the peace process forward. He might - and in fact he looks like the man who is going to - destabilise our area.\" The isolationist policy of the new US government also means prospects for peace are bleak.</p> <p><b>What effect will it really have?</b><br>Little effect is expected in the Knesset, as a coalition government will still be required. But in such a volatile political situation, the prime minister's actions can have a serious effect on the region. For example, Sharon's visit to the al-Asqa mosque in East Jerusalem sparked the four-month long intifada that has claimed hundreds of lives. Sharon insists that all of Jerusalem must remain in Israeli hands and that Palestinians must not be given more than the 42% of the West Bank they already have. This could mean the intifada being prolonged - especially as candidates hoping to replace Arafat vie for position.</p> <p><b>What about Yasser Arafat?</b><br>Arafat is struggling to keep control of the Palestinian Fatah party due to his age. During the intifada, new leaders have appeared, although Arafat continues to be an important figurehead. If and when Sharon replaces Barak, Arafat will probably have lost his best chance of winning a peace deal and a Palestinian homeland.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,434299,00.html\">06.02.2001: Disillusioned Israelis go to the polls</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html\">Timeline</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434007,00.html\">06.02.2001: Fear spurs voters into the arms of Sharon</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434013,00.html\">06.02.2001: Make or break vote lies with Russians</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433356,00.html\">06.02.2001, Neal Ascherson: So close to peace, so far away</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,430759,00.html\">30.01.2001, Matthew Engel: Sorry world, I'm going under cover</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edcc\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"  http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0112goldenberg2.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35)</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to prime minister of Israel</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br><a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br><a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br><a href=\"http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br><a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br><a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

Barak lost support from the Knesset because Jewish Israelis were angered by his pursuit of peace in spite of the increasingly violent intifada. Arab Israelis were also angered by his use of troops to quell the uprising - a decision later condemned by the United Nations. Additionally, his offer to share sovereignty of Jerusalem with the Palestinians annoyed Israeli rightwingers, and ended in failure when it was rejected by Yasser Arafat. Despite winning a confidence vote in the Knesset, Barak called a new election to renew his mandate for peace. Who's going to win? Barak is expected to be on the end of the heaviest political defeat in Israel's history as Ariel Sharon, leader of the hard right Likud party, and champion of Jewish settlements, is 22 points ahead in the polls. Arab Israelis, who would usually support Barak, are boycotting the election in protest at the killing of 13 young, unarmed Arab Israeli demonstrators by police last year. What are the differences in manifestos? Both Barak and Sharon are fighting the election on security issues. Barak told voters that they should choose between \"Barak or war\", while at the start of his campaign, Sharon pledged: \"Only I can bring you peace and security and protect Jerusalem. Because I know the Arabs and the Arabs know me.\" Where does Sharon's core support come from? The religious right backs his Likud party, but Sharon is also expected to receive massive support from the 1m Russian immigrants who now live in Israel. They form 18% of the electorate and their importance has been shown by Sharon's attempts at speeches in Russian. They have also been targeted by TV adverts in Russian. It was this section of the electorate that was credited with bringing Barak to power in 1999, but they have now turned their backs on him. A Russian was the first Israeli citizen killed by the intifada. Will a Sharon victory help revive the peace process? Probably not. Sharon is hated by the Palestinians due to his past exploits in the army and as defence secretary. In 1953, he led a massacre on Qibya, a Palestinian village, which left 69 villagers dead. Under his command, Israeli troops crossed into Lebanon in 1982 and this led to the massacre of more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees living in Beirut by pro-Israeli Lebanese militia. An Israeli report later found Sharon indirectly responsible for the massacre and recommended that he never be allowed to hold the position of defence secretary again. Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian cabinet minister and senior peace negiotiator, said: \"It does not look like he is the man who would push the peace process forward. He might - and in fact he looks like the man who is going to - destabilise our area.\" The isolationist policy of the new US government also means prospects for peace are bleak. What effect will it really have? Little effect is expected in the Knesset, as a coalition government will still be required. But in such a volatile political situation, the prime minister's actions can have a serious effect on the region. For example, Sharon's visit to the al-Asqa mosque in East Jerusalem sparked the four-month long intifada that has claimed hundreds of lives. Sharon insists that all of Jerusalem must remain in Israeli hands and that Palestinians must not be given more than the 42% of the West Bank they already have. This could mean the intifada being prolonged - especially as candidates hoping to replace Arafat vie for position. What about Yasser Arafat? Arafat is struggling to keep control of the Palestinian Fatah party due to his age. During the intifada, new leaders have appeared, although Arafat continues to be an important figurehead. If and when Sharon replaces Barak, Arafat will probably have lost his best chance of winning a peace deal and a Palestinian homeland.

      "bodyText": "Lord Wakeham, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, today claimed the regulator had \"changed the entire culture of British newspapers and magazines\". In a report marking the body's 10th anniversary, Lord Wakeham said: \"Ten years ago, I doubt there were very many editors who stopped themselves to ask 'Can we get away with it?' - because they knew they could. \"Today, the application and observance of the code are very much a part of the culture of every newsroom and editorial office.\" The code of practice was tightened after the death of Princess Diana three-and-a- half years ago. Guidelines on long-lens photography banned the paparazzi from private property, including restaurants and churches. New controls on doorstepping were also introduced, stopping hordes of journalists (and particularly TV cameras) camping at private addresses in the hope of getting an interview. Lord Wakeham said in his report that \"huge advances\" had been made in the protection of privacy. He claimed the PCC had proved \"self regulation is a key manifestation of freedom of expression\" and put paid to clamours for statutory regulation of the press. He added: \"There are no serious commentators now who believe statutory controls are either desirable or practical.\" Lord Wakeham contrasted the perception of the press and regulation today with the controversial situation at the beginning of the 1990s. At that time, David Mellor claimed the popular press were \"drinking in the last chance saloon\". Mr Mellor, then the \"minister of fun\" at the Department of Heritage, made the remarks following a report in 1993 carried out by Sir David Calcutt. He threatened to introduce a statutory body if press self-regulation did not lead to a marked improvement in standards of accuracy and privacy. Lord Wakeham's remarks come the day before the PCC throws a party for newspaper executives and hundreds of celebrities the press has clashed with over the last 10 years. Prince William will be the star turn at the bash, accompanied by his father and Camilla Parker Bowles. It will be the young prince's first official engagement since he turned 18. At the party, he will be seen in the company of Mrs Parker Bowles in public for the first time - a measure of the power of the PCC.

      "body": "<p>The struggle between the Chinese government and the banned Falun Gong (FLG) sect may seem far removed from the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. Yet it continues to be waged in the residential areas away from the downtown shopping malls and high-rise office blocks. Every city district has been holding meetings to convince ordinary citizens that the FLG is an \"evil cult\" and that the attempted suicides in Tiananmen Square last month are the final proof. In at least one district, the meeting was designed for the \"family members\" of FLG adherents - an indication that they still exist in sufficient numbers to be taken seriously. A mobile library has been cruising around local housing estates with a display of \"anti-heresy\" books. After a year and a half, the crackdown ordered personally by President Jiang Zemin still seems far from succeeding.</p> <p>The outside world is still a long way from forming a balanced view of this movement. The task has been immensely complicated by Beijing's punitive reaction, which violates the ordinary human rights of thousands of Chinese. We do not have to believe every report of deaths and torture in prisons: the rough handling of FLG protesters in Tiananmen Square gives a good guide to the authorities' ruthlessness.</p> <p>Yet while the sight of rank and file FLG members quietly risking their lives is impressive, it also raises questions about why they are doing so. These have been sharpened by the suicide attempt, in which one of the group actually died. (While FLG spokespeople insist that the incident was a frame-up, it is extremely hard to see how this could have been staged.) The most serious questions concern the role of the movement's master, Li Hongzhi, and the pronouncements he has issued from the safety of his US exile.</p> <p>Some analysts point to the increasingly apocalyptic tone of the master's messages, which may have encouraged his followers to go to such extreme lengths. For several years he has talked in vague terms about a coming \"catastrophe\" which will eliminate the \"bad people\" while allowing those who have followed his path to achieve salvation. Last year Mr Li went further, claiming that a dire prophecy by the 16th century French soothsayer Nostradamus referred to the current situation in China. He said that a reference in the prophecy to the Roman god Mars really indicated Marx -- or the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>In several messages last autumn, Mr Li denounced those of his followers who were forced to recant their faith, saying that they were serving the evil purposes of the regime. There seems no doubt that many practitioners headed for Tiananmen Square to face the regime's wrath, believing this was what the master required them to do.</p> <p>This was made very clear in an article, supposedly written by an anonymous practitioner, which the FLG circulated in December. The writer urged his fellow practitioners \"not to cover up yourself with excuses anymore. Teacher (the master) and yourself know your thoughts the best. The only thing left is whether or not you are willing to step forward and/or are capable of doing so.\"</p> <p>In a New Year's Day message, Mr Li carried his exhortation a stage further, arguing that \"forbearance\" had its limits when faced with evil. \"If the evil has already reached the point where it is unsaveable and unkeepable, then various measures at different levels can be used to stop it and eradicate it.\" Although vaguely worded, the message appears to have been interpreted by some followers as an instruction to abandon non-violence. Ten days later another message was posted to correct the misunderstanding.</p> <p>Falun Gong spokespeople have stressed that Mr Li continues to preach non-violence and that suicide is specifically excluded. But they also offer conflicting interpretations of his new year message: in one version, he was simply saying it was time \"to step forward and inform the public of the truth\". In another interpretation, he was predicting that the \"evil forces\" opposed to the FLG would meet disaster by supernatural means.</p> <p>Some experts who have studied the FLG closely feel that the net effect of Mr Li's exhortations has been to ratchet up the psychological pressure on his supporters to take extreme measures, including the suicide attempts.</p> <p>Other observers reject this view, arguing that FLG statements have also urged moderation. One from the master in August explicitly told followers that getting themselves jailed was not the only way of achieving merit, reportedly prompting some adherents to avoid active protest.</p> <p>At the very least the master has caused considerable confusion among his followers, in circumstances that for them (but not for him) may mean the difference between life and death.</p> <p>Sharper questions are also being asked about the master's past, his spiritual claims, his sources of income, and his motives for taking on the Chinese government. Although some of these were raised when he first emerged into the limelight, attention since then has focused understandably upon Beijing's savage treatment of his followers. Most western media have refrained from describing the Falun Gong as a cult, perhaps partly because the word was appropriated by Beijing.</p> <p>One of the few analysts to take a more critical look, the well-known Chinese intellectual Dai Qing, made a prescient forecast last year in a postscript to a speech she had given at Harvard.</p> <p>\"As long as the Communist party unreasonably insists that it is the only organisation to be respected, and FLG followers blindly worship and unconditionally follow their master\", she wrote, \"many frightful scenarios can still occur.\"</p> <p>Ms Dai describes Mr Li as \"capable yet immoral, ambitious yet irresponsible\". She points out the obvious fact that until April 1999, when Mr Li arranged a provocative demonstration in Beijing (and immediately left the country for the US), his followers were left alone to practise their beliefs.</p> <p>Ms Dai concludes that the unequal struggle between the FLG and Beijing has become the largest conflict in China's transition towards modernity - and that the behaviour of both sides is still rooted in the past.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.gittings@theguardian.com\">john.gittings@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4126173,00.html\">29.01.2001: China prepares for new offensive against 'dangerous' sect</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4122509,00.html\">24.01.2001: Suicide bids mar China's new year festivities</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4104486,00.html\">13.12.2000: China jails US-based sect members</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4043167,00.html\">22.07.2000: Illegal sect keeps needling Beijing</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28john+gittings%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=john+gittings&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by John Gittings</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~asiactr/haq/200003/0003a005.htm\">Dai Qing's article</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.clearwisdom.net\">Falun Gong site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/\" target=\"_new\">China Briefing</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/\" target=\"_new\">Chinese government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.peopledaily.com.cn/english/\" target=\"_new\">People's Daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sinopolis.com\" target=\"_new\">Sinopolis.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html\" target=\"_new\">US Library of Congress Country Study: China</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The struggle between the Chinese government and the banned Falun Gong (FLG) sect may seem far removed from the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. Yet it continues to be waged in the residential areas away from the downtown shopping malls and high-rise office blocks. Every city district has been holding meetings to convince ordinary citizens that the FLG is an \"evil cult\" and that the attempted suicides in Tiananmen Square last month are the final proof. In at least one district, the meeting was designed for the \"family members\" of FLG adherents - an indication that they still exist in sufficient numbers to be taken seriously. A mobile library has been cruising around local housing estates with a display of \"anti-heresy\" books. After a year and a half, the crackdown ordered personally by President Jiang Zemin still seems far from succeeding. The outside world is still a long way from forming a balanced view of this movement. The task has been immensely complicated by Beijing's punitive reaction, which violates the ordinary human rights of thousands of Chinese. We do not have to believe every report of deaths and torture in prisons: the rough handling of FLG protesters in Tiananmen Square gives a good guide to the authorities' ruthlessness. Yet while the sight of rank and file FLG members quietly risking their lives is impressive, it also raises questions about why they are doing so. These have been sharpened by the suicide attempt, in which one of the group actually died. (While FLG spokespeople insist that the incident was a frame-up, it is extremely hard to see how this could have been staged.) The most serious questions concern the role of the movement's master, Li Hongzhi, and the pronouncements he has issued from the safety of his US exile. Some analysts point to the increasingly apocalyptic tone of the master's messages, which may have encouraged his followers to go to such extreme lengths. For several years he has talked in vague terms about a coming \"catastrophe\" which will eliminate the \"bad people\" while allowing those who have followed his path to achieve salvation. Last year Mr Li went further, claiming that a dire prophecy by the 16th century French soothsayer Nostradamus referred to the current situation in China. He said that a reference in the prophecy to the Roman god Mars really indicated Marx -- or the Chinese Communist party. In several messages last autumn, Mr Li denounced those of his followers who were forced to recant their faith, saying that they were serving the evil purposes of the regime. There seems no doubt that many practitioners headed for Tiananmen Square to face the regime's wrath, believing this was what the master required them to do. This was made very clear in an article, supposedly written by an anonymous practitioner, which the FLG circulated in December. The writer urged his fellow practitioners \"not to cover up yourself with excuses anymore. Teacher (the master) and yourself know your thoughts the best. The only thing left is whether or not you are willing to step forward and/or are capable of doing so.\" In a New Year's Day message, Mr Li carried his exhortation a stage further, arguing that \"forbearance\" had its limits when faced with evil. \"If the evil has already reached the point where it is unsaveable and unkeepable, then various measures at different levels can be used to stop it and eradicate it.\" Although vaguely worded, the message appears to have been interpreted by some followers as an instruction to abandon non-violence. Ten days later another message was posted to correct the misunderstanding. Falun Gong spokespeople have stressed that Mr Li continues to preach non-violence and that suicide is specifically excluded. But they also offer conflicting interpretations of his new year message: in one version, he was simply saying it was time \"to step forward and inform the public of the truth\". In another interpretation, he was predicting that the \"evil forces\" opposed to the FLG would meet disaster by supernatural means. Some experts who have studied the FLG closely feel that the net effect of Mr Li's exhortations has been to ratchet up the psychological pressure on his supporters to take extreme measures, including the suicide attempts. Other observers reject this view, arguing that FLG statements have also urged moderation. One from the master in August explicitly told followers that getting themselves jailed was not the only way of achieving merit, reportedly prompting some adherents to avoid active protest. At the very least the master has caused considerable confusion among his followers, in circumstances that for them (but not for him) may mean the difference between life and death. Sharper questions are also being asked about the master's past, his spiritual claims, his sources of income, and his motives for taking on the Chinese government. Although some of these were raised when he first emerged into the limelight, attention since then has focused understandably upon Beijing's savage treatment of his followers. Most western media have refrained from describing the Falun Gong as a cult, perhaps partly because the word was appropriated by Beijing. One of the few analysts to take a more critical look, the well-known Chinese intellectual Dai Qing, made a prescient forecast last year in a postscript to a speech she had given at Harvard. \"As long as the Communist party unreasonably insists that it is the only organisation to be respected, and FLG followers blindly worship and unconditionally follow their master\", she wrote, \"many frightful scenarios can still occur.\" Ms Dai describes Mr Li as \"capable yet immoral, ambitious yet irresponsible\". She points out the obvious fact that until April 1999, when Mr Li arranged a provocative demonstration in Beijing (and immediately left the country for the US), his followers were left alone to practise their beliefs. Ms Dai concludes that the unequal struggle between the FLG and Beijing has become the largest conflict in China's transition towards modernity - and that the behaviour of both sides is still rooted in the past.

Representatives of his Northern &amp; Shell company are meeting senior managers at Daily Telegraph publisher Hollinger, which owns 50% of the money-spinning plant and has exercised an option to buy out the rest of the operation. A deal with the Telegraph will ease the cashflow situation at Mr Desmond's publishing empire, which paid \u00a3125m for the Express newspapers and the Westferry holding in November last year. \"Once an agreement takes place, there will not be much to be seen to, as the deal has to be done through an arranged formula,\" said a spokeswoman for Northern &amp; Shell. Sheadded that the stake should fetch \u00a380m, which would go some way to paying back the \u00a397m loan which Mr Desmond took out to fund the controversial acquisition. Sources say a more realistic price is between \u00a350m and \u00a360m. Northern &amp; Shell has only held preliminary discussions with Hollinger over the plant, which prints the southern editions of the Telegraph papers, the Guardian and the Financial Times, as well as the Express which pays \u00a390m a year for its papers to be printed. \"There were preliminary meetings with the Daily Telegraph management, at which Hollinger said it was interested in buying the stake,\" said the spokeswoman. The Docklands-based Westferry plant is understood to contribute a substantial amount to the balance sheet at the Daily Express, the Sunday Express and the Daily Star. Under the terms of the sale, Mr Desmond will still be able to print the Express at Westferry. Northern &amp; Shell senior executives are also set to make large-scale redundancies at the papers, which employ a total of 580 journalists. Several high-profile writers have already left the Daily Express in protest at Mr Desmond's background as a publisher of pornographic magazines.",

Where better to launch a massive tribute to one of the greatest and most reserved Irish playwrights of the last century, Samuel Beckett? Nineteen directors were let loose on the entire Beckett theatrical canon, from Oscar-winners (Anthony Minghella) to Turner prize-winners (Damien Hirst). </p> <p>Gravity, restraint . . . well, perhaps not. We stood in our hundreds in the great hall, shoulder to shoulder, glasses in our fists, as the president of Ireland, Mary McAleese, told a joke about Beckett; and then Michael Colgan of the Gate theatre, one of the inspirational figures behind this extraordinary event, delivered his peroration on the triumph of art and Irishmen and women. </p> <p>Then on we went towards the tom-toms of the city's trendiest nightclub. This is the way the Irish celebrate the Wittgenstein of literature: without inhibition; always referring to him possessively by his first name, no obligation to read or see the work before joining the parade. </p> <p>Beckett's plays have been filmed before, but the Beckett estate was persuaded by people such as Colgan and Joe Mulholland of RTE (Irish state television) to allow the full canon to go before the cameras. The first game, then, was to detect which of the 19 directors had got away with taking what liberties. Who had used close-ups to chop up a work? Who intruded with nosy zooms? </p> <p>Before the screenings there were alarmist rumours that the director of The English Patient, Anthony Minghella, who had taken on Play, had sacrilegiously pitched the stage work's three figures, who are stranded up to their necks in urns, into a teeming landscape of endless figures in urns; there was also indignation that Patricia Rozema had transported Happy Days to sunny Tenerife. Had they all been properly briefed on the difference between a Beckettian \"stop\" and \"pause\"? </p> <p>But after I had seen 14 of the 19 works an extraordinary phenomenon became clear: the spectacle of a man from the grave gently taming 19 of the world's most individual directors, among them Neil Jordan, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, David Mamet, Atom Egoyan, Richard Eyre. Damien Hirst was thrown a small bone (virtually openly acknowledged as a necessary publicity stunt); he was prudently only allowed the 45 seconds of Breath. This was the piece written for Oh! Calcutta! - \"On a set full of rubbish a person cries out and breathes in again.\" Kenneth Tynan enraged Beckett by adding \"and naked bodies\". Beckett withdrew the sketch. Hirst dutifully came up with unpopulated rubbish. </p> <p>The most poignant work was Catastrophe, the last screen appearance of John Gielgud. He died a few weeks after shooting. Catastrophe was the one politically overt play Beckett ever wrote; it was dedicated to Vaclav Havel in 1982 when Havel was still a persecuted writer. Harold Pinter was offered the direction but instead chose to act in it; David Mamet took over. Gielgud, mute throughout, plays the Protagonist, standing on a black box submitting to the Director's callous, humiliating direction. </p> <p>It was rather touching that the majority of the egos involved quickly acknowledged that no one knew better than Beckett how the works should be performed and made no serious at tempts to impose their will. Many of them were chosen because of a lifelong, if not publicly apparent, admiration for the work. Minghella said that, as an impressionable 20-year-old student, he spent so much time poring over the Master's collection in Reading university that briefly his handwriting began to resemble Beckett's. </p> <p>Richard Eyre came to do Rockaby (an elderly woman sits in a rocking chair and listens to her own recorded voice) for more personal reasons. Not only has he been working on a film about Iris Murdoch's last years with Alzheimer's, but his mother died with the same condition. \"So early dementia,\" he said, \"was a resonant theme for me.\" Eyre feels that far from being unsuitable for film, \"in fact, the very precise directions about light and coming in and out of shadow makes the work much easier to achieve on film. The transition is seamless.\" </p> <p>Eyre said he felt no constraints working to Beckett's restrictions. \"I wanted to start the film outside the window, and was allowed to open it out that much. You have to suggest the room and window without being too specific. I did want to shoot from the back of the head to emphasise the void but I was not allowed. But it was not necessary. I was allowed to end with a top shot.\" </p> <p>Minghella said: \"You discover there is a kind of inexorability about the text. There is only one way to do it. Play is as close to being perfectly written as any play can be.\" There was no difficulty about the final scene in which the figures in urns are repeated ad infinitum. This simply underlines the point that this is not just a particular trio suffering; their banal suffering is repeated across the universe. </p> <p>The sculptor Charles Garrad (That Time) came by an appro priate route. His work, he said, increasingly began to resemble unpopulated film sets. His elaborate set for Lindsay-Hogg's Waiting for Godot involved filling a shed in Monaghan with 1,000 tons of shale. But when he made That Time - a lank grey-haired man sits in a void and is bombarded by voices - there was no decor. \"I would have liked to have had some colours and shapes reflected in his eyes - nothing concrete - but it was not allowed,\" he said. \"I soon realised that the way he put it together is the best way for it to work. It was not that I was forbidden by a higher authority.\" </p> <p>It was appropriate that it was the youngest director, Enda Hughes, representing in a way the 21st century, who found the trick for breaking free of the restraints without betraying Beckett's intention. He achieved it with a brilliant, simple leap of the imagination. In the original of Act Without Words II the stage is divided precisely into three squares. Hughes simply transferred it to celluloid. What we see now is not an empty stage but a screen split into three separate frames, making the divisions more plausible, and in these frames the characters cavort in a manner that recalls those old music hall acts on silent film that so fascinated Beckett. </p> <p>Dublin-born Conor McPherson was given one of the plums, Endgame. With the powerful assistance of two splendid actors, Michael Gambon and David Thewlis, and a good director of photography, Donal Gilligan, the result is quite adequate. But McPherson stumbled out of this experience with this insight: \"Beckett thought people were stupid.\" He also declared that Endgame was full of rubbish. You'd have to stand on your head with your eyes shut to miss the extraordinary compassion Beckett has for us poor unfortunates so pluckily struggling to survive in an absurd life. </p> <p>\u0095 Channel 4 will begin screening the Beckett films in the summer.</p>",

But after I had seen 14 of the 19 works an extraordinary phenomenon became clear: the spectacle of a man from the grave gently taming 19 of the world's most individual directors, among them Neil Jordan, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, David Mamet, Atom Egoyan, Richard Eyre. Damien Hirst was thrown a small bone (virtually openly acknowledged as a necessary publicity stunt); he was prudently only allowed the 45 seconds of Breath. This was the piece written for Oh! Calcutta! - \"On a set full of rubbish a person cries out and breathes in again.\" Kenneth Tynan enraged Beckett by adding \"and naked bodies\". Beckett withdrew the sketch. Hirst dutifully came up with unpopulated rubbish. The most poignant work was Catastrophe, the last screen appearance of John Gielgud. He died a few weeks after shooting. Catastrophe was the one politically overt play Beckett ever wrote; it was dedicated to Vaclav Havel in 1982 when Havel was still a persecuted writer. Harold Pinter was offered the direction but instead chose to act in it; David Mamet took over. Gielgud, mute throughout, plays the Protagonist, standing on a black box submitting to the Director's callous, humiliating direction. It was rather touching that the majority of the egos involved quickly acknowledged that no one knew better than Beckett how the works should be performed and made no serious at tempts to impose their will. Many of them were chosen because of a lifelong, if not publicly apparent, admiration for the work. Minghella said that, as an impressionable 20-year-old student, he spent so much time poring over the Master's collection in Reading university that briefly his handwriting began to resemble Beckett's. Richard Eyre came to do Rockaby (an elderly woman sits in a rocking chair and listens to her own recorded voice) for more personal reasons. Not only has he been working on a film about Iris Murdoch's last years with Alzheimer's, but his mother died with the same condition. \"So early dementia,\" he said, \"was a resonant theme for me.\" Eyre feels that far from being unsuitable for film, \"in fact, the very precise directions about light and coming in and out of shadow makes the work much easier to achieve on film. The transition is seamless.\" Eyre said he felt no constraints working to Beckett's restrictions. \"I wanted to start the film outside the window, and was allowed to open it out that much. You have to suggest the room and window without being too specific. I did want to shoot from the back of the head to emphasise the void but I was not allowed. But it was not necessary. I was allowed to end with a top shot.\" Minghella said: \"You discover there is a kind of inexorability about the text. There is only one way to do it. Play is as close to being perfectly written as any play can be.\" There was no difficulty about the final scene in which the figures in urns are repeated ad infinitum. This simply underlines the point that this is not just a particular trio suffering; their banal suffering is repeated across the universe. The sculptor Charles Garrad (That Time) came by an appro priate route. His work, he said, increasingly began to resemble unpopulated film sets. His elaborate set for Lindsay-Hogg's Waiting for Godot involved filling a shed in Monaghan with 1,000 tons of shale. But when he made That Time - a lank grey-haired man sits in a void and is bombarded by voices - there was no decor. \"I would have liked to have had some colours and shapes reflected in his eyes - nothing concrete - but it was not allowed,\" he said. \"I soon realised that the way he put it together is the best way for it to work. It was not that I was forbidden by a higher authority.\" It was appropriate that it was the youngest director, Enda Hughes, representing in a way the 21st century, who found the trick for breaking free of the restraints without betraying Beckett's intention. He achieved it with a brilliant, simple leap of the imagination. In the original of Act Without Words II the stage is divided precisely into three squares. Hughes simply transferred it to celluloid. What we see now is not an empty stage but a screen split into three separate frames, making the divisions more plausible, and in these frames the characters cavort in a manner that recalls those old music hall acts on silent film that so fascinated Beckett. Dublin-born Conor McPherson was given one of the plums, Endgame. With the powerful assistance of two splendid actors, Michael Gambon and David Thewlis, and a good director of photography, Donal Gilligan, the result is quite adequate. But McPherson stumbled out of this experience with this insight: \"Beckett thought people were stupid.\" He also declared that Endgame was full of rubbish. You'd have to stand on your head with your eyes shut to miss the extraordinary compassion Beckett has for us poor unfortunates so pluckily struggling to survive in an absurd life. \u0095 Channel 4 will begin screening the Beckett films in the summer.",

      "bodyText": "Flagship BBC1 documentary strand Omnibus is being shunted to BBC2 for most of its run, confirming fears that arts would be marginalised in the BBC1 schedules. Controller of arts commissioning Roly Keating has revealed it will appear more often on BBC2 in future in a shake-up of arts programming. The current Sunday night BBC2 arts programming block is also to move to Saturday evening and lose its Art Zone branding, as part of the changes planned by Mr Keating. In addition, cult music show Later with Jools Holland is to move from Saturday to Friday night, where it will be scheduled at 11.30pm after Late Review. As revealed in November, the Mark Lawson-fronted arts review show is also moving, from the Sunday Art Zone to a new Friday berth following Newsnight. Mr Keating, in an interview with the Independent, said that from now on Omnibus documentaries \"would have to have a sense of the scale and excitement to feel like a national event\" to make it onto BBC1. Otherwise, they will feature in the Saturday night BBC2 arts block, between 7 and 9pm. Mr Keating said he was scrapping the Art Zone brand because \"it may have put off as many people as it brought in\". \"Now from 7 to 9 on Saturday nights we can have two long-form arts pieces, maybe an Omnibus documentary followed by a concert performance,\" he added.",

Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki are \"kaffirs\", he sings in Afrikaans, and kaffirs had better beware because they rape white women and children. Then he gets to the point. The president should just \"fuck off\" and Mandela \"spyker sy ma\" (sleeps with his mother). There is nothing much unusual about such sentiments in certain sections of South Africa, even today. But it is rare that they are recorded and distributed on a CD. Now the man who wrote and sang the songs, Shane McCallaghan, finds himself threatened with prosecution and hailed as a defender of free speech when he says it was all a joke. The CD was recorded three years ago, copied from a tape made at a party, but it only got its first public airing on a Johannesburg radio station last month. Most who heard it were shocked, if not at the offensiveness of suggesting Nelson Mandela had sex with his mother, then the daring - or stupidity, depending how you look at it - of recording such a thing in modern South Africa. Amid a barrage of denunciations, the statutory human rights commission asked the director of public prosecutions to charge Mr McCallaghan with promoting racial hatred - a crime in South Africa. The commission said that the CD \"clearly constitutes a violation of the right to dignity of millions of South Africans\". \"It remains a matter of deep concern to the commission that, six years after the establishment of a democratic order, there remain people who continue to engage in the business of race hate in the most vile and repugnant form, as some of the material on the CD demonstrates,\" the commission said. The ruling African National Congress went so far as to describe the recording as a \"threat to the stability of the country\", although few others see it as that serious. Others say it is a matter of free speech, and note that the human rights commission has not demanded the prosecution of a number of black politicians who might be accused of promoting racial hatred - including a member of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature who held his nose and said that white legislators stank. Mr McCallaghan, who describes himself as a professional comedian, was full of apologies.

I want to apologise for them.\" Mr McCallaghan's claim does not quite gel. He was, presumably, sober when the original recording was transferred to several hundred CDs and sold to clubs and individuals who thought it was great entertainment for their own parties. But it has forced a broader debate about the impact of aggressive song lyrics so popular among young South Africans. Mr McCallaghan's deeply offensive, if somewhat ludicrous, CD reached only a few hundred generally like-minded people. But some of the biggest stars of rap and kwaito - a South African sound modelled on hip-hop - glorify rape in a country where rape is not only common but viewed as a rite of passage by some young men, murder where murder is sadly routine, and racial conflict when racial divisions are still wide. The deeply controversial American white rap singer, Eninem, who quite freely sings about \"niggaz\", is hugely popular in South Africa. Another performer, Nastradamus, sings about the \"muthafuckin president\". He is, presumably, talking about the man in the White House, but the sentiment is much the same as Mr McCallaghan's. The human rights commission has no plans to try and ban such music in South Africa. The freedom of speech guarantees in the constitution would probably make it impossible to do so.

      "bodyText": "Michael Stone today won his court of appeal challenge to his convictions for the murders of Lin and Megan Russell. Three judges in London indicated that they would \"allow the appeal\" on the basis of the unreliability of key witness Barry Thompson's evidence, given at Stone's trail. Stone, 40, of Gillingham, Kent, will remain in custody pending deliberation by the court on Thursday on the issue of a possible retrial. Today's drama unfolded on the second day of Stone's appeal before Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Maurice Kay and Mrs Justice Hallett at London's law courts. Stone was given three life sentences at Maidstone crown court in 1998 for the two murders, and the attempted murder of Megan's sister, Josie, near their home at Chillenden, Kent in 1996. He was in court for the announcement. Sitting in the dock, flanked by security officers, Stone turned to his sister Barbara and smiled, and she then punched the air in delight. He could be free later this week if the court does not order a re-trial. The appeal court's decision followed the revelation that the prosecution could no longer rely on one of its key witness, Mr Thompson, as a \"witness of truth\". Stone's counsel, Mr William Clegg QC, told the three judges that just \"moments ago\" he was handed a document by the crown. Mr Clegg read out from the document. The prosecution stated in the document that having considered all the material now before the court for the purpose of the appeal, the crown \"cannot seek to rely on Barry Thompson as a witness of truth\". Thompson, who told the jury that Stone had confessed to the killings while in prison, reportedly said just days after the conviction that he had told the jury \"a pack of lies\" when he claimed Stone had threatened him and referred to the murders. He has claimed in newspaper articles that he and another key witness against Stone at his trial were \"paid police informants\". It was shortly after this announcement that Lord Justice Kennedy said the court was \"minded\" to allow the appeal. The court has not formally quashed the conviction and Lord Justice Kennedy warned that the proceedings were still \"live\" and there was a realistic possibility of an order for a re-trial and that therefore nothing to Stone's detriment may be published in the interim. Yesterday, Mr Clegg said that Mr Thompson had now changed his story. \"What he says is completely contrary to the evidence he gave at the trial,\" Mr Clegg said. He now says Stone made no confession of any kind to him and that his evidence at Maidstone was untruthful.\" Another prosecution witness, Damien Daley, also gave evidence that Stone had confessed to the killings in prison. Stone, who has spent much of his life in prison and institutions and has had addictions to heroin and alcohol, has steadfastly denied any involvement in the killings.

      "body": "<p>New Year's Day 2000 at the Heavenly Valley ski resort in Nevada and the pupils of Hayle Community School were enjoying the first day of the new millennium on the Big Dipper, a ski run graded \"blue\". At first, 15-year-old Rachel Williams appeared to be doing fine, but seconds later she lost control and careered off the marked slope into a tree. She was killed instantly. It was no one's fault. </p> <p>\"I thought that it must have been a coach crash,\" said Rachel's mother Helen. \"I couldn't believe the accident had happened whilst she was skiing. I thought they would be on the nursery slopes.\" </p> <p>Over the next few weeks thousands of children will travel out on a school trip to Europe's ski slopes. The vast majority will have a great time, but skiing is potentially very dangerous and parents sometimes learn too late that the phrase \"holiday of a lifetime\" can turn out to have far too literal a meaning. </p> <p>Despite the popularity of the sport, few of the parents sending children on these trips are aware what is involved. Parents who ski are only too aware: \"I would never send my children on one of these trips,\" one parent told the Guardian. \"I've seen what happens when they get out there.\" </p> <p>Hayle Community School runs a regular ski trip abroad led by geography teacher Phil Allen. He organised the year 2000 trip to Heavenly Valley. At an information evening Allen showed parents slides he'd taken on a taster visit to the area and teenagers started saving the \u00a3765 the trip was going to cost. </p> <p>The first disappointment was the accommodation. \"We were disgusted,\" said one of Rachel's roommates. \"It looked really seedy, a grotty hotel.\" Students were in pairs with double beds, which they had to share. Rooms opened directly onto verandas open to the public walking by. Rachel and her roommates were disappointed - and a little frightened. Evening activities promised in the brochure failed to materialise and one of the adults with the trip described the organisation as a \"real shambles\". </p> <p>This contrasted with the mornings spent skiing with the Heavenly Valley ski school. In groups of eight or nine students were given professional tuition by qualified instructors. The instruction was \"very good . . . brilliant\". </p> <p>\"It all progressed very quickly,\" said one student. \"Everyone seemed to get much better.\" Rachel was a natural, who always chose to ski. </p> <p>In the afternoons, Hayle's teachers would take the students back out onto the slopes to practise their skills. \"One afternoon we went right to the top,\" recalled a student. \"It was the third day. He [Allen] took us onto a blue slope: it was very busy and really steep, lots of people were falling over and getting stuck.\" </p> <p>Ski runs are graded green, blue, red and black. Green is the easiest. Blue is more difficult, but skiers would expect most beginners to attempt a blue run on this kind of trip. But, for most experts, the caveat would be \"under instruction\". By the end of the week nearly all the students had covered the skills necessary to attempt a blue slope with the ski school and Phil Allen was leading the group once again when the accident happened. </p> <p>Allen was operating within Cornwall Education Authority guidelines and an inquest found that he was not responsible for Rachel's death. There was no evidence that she would still be alive if the trip had been organised differently, but the accident highlights areas of concern about the way school skiing trips are run. Ski experts are uncomfortable about a system which allows teachers with minimal skiing qualifications to lead groups. </p> <p>British ski professionals need a British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI) award, which takes between two and four years to achieve. Allen, who had been skiing for more than 30 years, holds the much less stringent Ski Course Organisers (SCO) award. This is an English Ski Council qualification to prepare party leaders to take groups of young people skiing. It is achieved after a one-week course. Cornwall LEA is happy to allow teachers holding this qualification to lead groups. </p> <p>Freddie Foxon is an ESC coach and the editor of the handbook for the SCO programme. He is worried about the size of the groups that teachers sometimes take out onto the slopes. In this case there were 16 in the party - no problem, according to Cornwall LEA, but double the number the American instructors were taking in the morning. However, as Allen himself told the inquest, it is \"normal\" to see such large groups in Europe. </p> <p>There is no suggestion from any of these experts that Phil Allen was responsible for Rachel Williams' death. Students who were with the party that day said his instructions were clear. He told them to ski at a speed they were comfortable with. On ski slopes, accidents will happen. But there are doubts about the system, which allows teachers to take children out onto the slopes without having a ski instructor's qualification. </p> <p>In the Alps, skiers are used to encountering school parties led by teachers who may have the ESC award or no qualifications whatsoever. Commercial school tour operators routinely offer just two hours of professional ski tuition in the morning, leaving groups to make their own arrangements in the afternoon. </p> <p>Many schools choose to pay for extra professional instruction. \"One of the great dangers with good recreational skiers is that they forget what it was like to be beginners,\" says Peter Kuwall, BASI's technical development manager. </p> <p>At Shropshire's William Brookes School, Dave Riley has been organising ski trips for many years. One of his sixth-formers is Arabella Ashfield, currently a member of the English junior ski squad. \"My personal view is that there is no way the teacher should be teaching or instructing the group in the afternoon,\" says Riley. \"Teachers should focus on the pastoral management of the group.\" </p> <p>Riley books with Interski, a commercial operator which includes morning and afternoon instruction as part of the basic package. Riley buys additional time to allow instructors to stay with their groups throughout the day. </p> <p>Riley's checklist could be seen as a model for schools and will be of intrest to any parent whose child is clamouring to go on a trip. He tries to get sole occupancy of the hotel and he ensures that parents are fully informed about all aspects of the trip. That includes being clear about the risks children will face. Before they leave he insists that all the children learn basic skills at the local dry ski slope. </p> <p>\"Its very important that the kids are well prepared,\" he says. \"I want them to be able to ski from the top of our local dry ski slope before they go. This isn't a holiday, it's a learning experience.\" Cornwall LEA does not accept there was anything wrong with the way the Hayle trip was organised. In a statement, a spokesperson for the authority said: \"A number of concerns have been raised by Rachel's parents, all of which we have carefully investigated. The coroner's verdict is clear and lays no blame on any adult members of the party . . . Our investigations have not led me to recommend any changes of procedure.\" </p> <p>Different LEAs have different policies. But Shropshire LEA would not allow teachers with an SCO award to lead groups and their recommended tutor:pupil ratio is 1:10. </p> <p>Every death on a school trip sends a chill through parents, who have no way of checking whether the holiday they are paying for is safe. </p> <p>Outdoor activity trips within the UK are inspected by the Adventurous Activities Licensing Authority (AALA). All centres and individual instructors offering sailing, canoeing, climbing, trekking or skiing are inspected and licensed. AALA has no control over trips abroad and no remit to inspect schools. But there is nothing to stop schools and local authorities requesting their expert assistance. \"We would be happy to advise or to be part of an inquiry team,\" says Marcus Baillie, AALA's chief inspector. \"We already assist local authorities, the marine investigation branch and the police.\" </p> <p>He makes the point that a common knee-jerk reaction to accidents is to simply ban further activities. Some activities will always involve a certain level of risk, but a proper inquiry system would, he argues, allow lessons to be learned. </p> <p>Local authority guidelines on how these trips are run are not backed up by clear government advice, despite some excellent general guidance. One way round this problem would be for the government to require LEAs to invite third parties to investigate serious incidents on school trips. But the DfEE has \"no plans\" to change the current system. <br></p> <p><strong>What should parents demand?</strong></p> <p>\u0095 An information evening with a slide/video presentation of the resort. </p> <p>\u0095 Advance tuition at a local dry ski slope (schools may have to organise this). </p> <p>\u0095 Professional tuition by BASI (or European equivalent) qualified instructors at ratios of 1:10 or less. </p> <p>\u0095 Lift passes and ski equipment, though most operators charge extra to hire ski clothing. </p> <p>\u0095 Quality hotel accommodation close to ski lifts. Shared rooms with single beds are normal, but parents should expect no more than three children per room. No additional meal or lunch costs at the resort. </p> <p>\u0095 An evening programme - skating, swimming, pizza evening, prizes - at no extra cost. </p> <p>\u0095 Total financial protection. Fully-bonded ABTA membership and AITO membership should be standard. Comprehensive insurance with no excess clauses. </p> <p>\u0095 School ski operators in Europe should be able to offer the above for less than \u00a3500 per child.</p>",

      "bodyText": "New Year's Day 2000 at the Heavenly Valley ski resort in Nevada and the pupils of Hayle Community School were enjoying the first day of the new millennium on the Big Dipper, a ski run graded \"blue\". At first, 15-year-old Rachel Williams appeared to be doing fine, but seconds later she lost control and careered off the marked slope into a tree. She was killed instantly. It was no one's fault. \"I thought that it must have been a coach crash,\" said Rachel's mother Helen. \"I couldn't believe the accident had happened whilst she was skiing. I thought they would be on the nursery slopes.\" Over the next few weeks thousands of children will travel out on a school trip to Europe's ski slopes. The vast majority will have a great time, but skiing is potentially very dangerous and parents sometimes learn too late that the phrase \"holiday of a lifetime\" can turn out to have far too literal a meaning. Despite the popularity of the sport, few of the parents sending children on these trips are aware what is involved. Parents who ski are only too aware: \"I would never send my children on one of these trips,\" one parent told the Guardian. \"I've seen what happens when they get out there.\" Hayle Community School runs a regular ski trip abroad led by geography teacher Phil Allen. He organised the year 2000 trip to Heavenly Valley. At an information evening Allen showed parents slides he'd taken on a taster visit to the area and teenagers started saving the \u00a3765 the trip was going to cost. The first disappointment was the accommodation. \"We were disgusted,\" said one of Rachel's roommates. \"It looked really seedy, a grotty hotel.\" Students were in pairs with double beds, which they had to share. Rooms opened directly onto verandas open to the public walking by. Rachel and her roommates were disappointed - and a little frightened. Evening activities promised in the brochure failed to materialise and one of the adults with the trip described the organisation as a \"real shambles\". This contrasted with the mornings spent skiing with the Heavenly Valley ski school. In groups of eight or nine students were given professional tuition by qualified instructors. The instruction was \"very good . . . brilliant\". \"It all progressed very quickly,\" said one student. \"Everyone seemed to get much better.\" Rachel was a natural, who always chose to ski. In the afternoons, Hayle's teachers would take the students back out onto the slopes to practise their skills. \"One afternoon we went right to the top,\" recalled a student. \"It was the third day. He [Allen] took us onto a blue slope: it was very busy and really steep, lots of people were falling over and getting stuck.\" Ski runs are graded green, blue, red and black. Green is the easiest. Blue is more difficult, but skiers would expect most beginners to attempt a blue run on this kind of trip. But, for most experts, the caveat would be \"under instruction\". By the end of the week nearly all the students had covered the skills necessary to attempt a blue slope with the ski school and Phil Allen was leading the group once again when the accident happened. Allen was operating within Cornwall Education Authority guidelines and an inquest found that he was not responsible for Rachel's death. There was no evidence that she would still be alive if the trip had been organised differently, but the accident highlights areas of concern about the way school skiing trips are run. Ski experts are uncomfortable about a system which allows teachers with minimal skiing qualifications to lead groups. British ski professionals need a British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI) award, which takes between two and four years to achieve. Allen, who had been skiing for more than 30 years, holds the much less stringent Ski Course Organisers (SCO) award. This is an English Ski Council qualification to prepare party leaders to take groups of young people skiing. It is achieved after a one-week course. Cornwall LEA is happy to allow teachers holding this qualification to lead groups. Freddie Foxon is an ESC coach and the editor of the handbook for the SCO programme. He is worried about the size of the groups that teachers sometimes take out onto the slopes. In this case there were 16 in the party - no problem, according to Cornwall LEA, but double the number the American instructors were taking in the morning. However, as Allen himself told the inquest, it is \"normal\" to see such large groups in Europe. There is no suggestion from any of these experts that Phil Allen was responsible for Rachel Williams' death. Students who were with the party that day said his instructions were clear. He told them to ski at a speed they were comfortable with. On ski slopes, accidents will happen. But there are doubts about the system, which allows teachers to take children out onto the slopes without having a ski instructor's qualification. In the Alps, skiers are used to encountering school parties led by teachers who may have the ESC award or no qualifications whatsoever. Commercial school tour operators routinely offer just two hours of professional ski tuition in the morning, leaving groups to make their own arrangements in the afternoon. Many schools choose to pay for extra professional instruction. \"One of the great dangers with good recreational skiers is that they forget what it was like to be beginners,\" says Peter Kuwall, BASI's technical development manager. At Shropshire's William Brookes School, Dave Riley has been organising ski trips for many years. One of his sixth-formers is Arabella Ashfield, currently a member of the English junior ski squad. \"My personal view is that there is no way the teacher should be teaching or instructing the group in the afternoon,\" says Riley. \"Teachers should focus on the pastoral management of the group.\" Riley books with Interski, a commercial operator which includes morning and afternoon instruction as part of the basic package. Riley buys additional time to allow instructors to stay with their groups throughout the day. Riley's checklist could be seen as a model for schools and will be of intrest to any parent whose child is clamouring to go on a trip. He tries to get sole occupancy of the hotel and he ensures that parents are fully informed about all aspects of the trip. That includes being clear about the risks children will face. Before they leave he insists that all the children learn basic skills at the local dry ski slope. \"Its very important that the kids are well prepared,\" he says. \"I want them to be able to ski from the top of our local dry ski slope before they go. This isn't a holiday, it's a learning experience.\" Cornwall LEA does not accept there was anything wrong with the way the Hayle trip was organised. In a statement, a spokesperson for the authority said: \"A number of concerns have been raised by Rachel's parents, all of which we have carefully investigated. The coroner's verdict is clear and lays no blame on any adult members of the party . . . Our investigations have not led me to recommend any changes of procedure.\" Different LEAs have different policies. But Shropshire LEA would not allow teachers with an SCO award to lead groups and their recommended tutor:pupil ratio is 1:10. Every death on a school trip sends a chill through parents, who have no way of checking whether the holiday they are paying for is safe. Outdoor activity trips within the UK are inspected by the Adventurous Activities Licensing Authority (AALA). All centres and individual instructors offering sailing, canoeing, climbing, trekking or skiing are inspected and licensed. AALA has no control over trips abroad and no remit to inspect schools. But there is nothing to stop schools and local authorities requesting their expert assistance. \"We would be happy to advise or to be part of an inquiry team,\" says Marcus Baillie, AALA's chief inspector. \"We already assist local authorities, the marine investigation branch and the police.\" He makes the point that a common knee-jerk reaction to accidents is to simply ban further activities. Some activities will always involve a certain level of risk, but a proper inquiry system would, he argues, allow lessons to be learned. Local authority guidelines on how these trips are run are not backed up by clear government advice, despite some excellent general guidance. One way round this problem would be for the government to require LEAs to invite third parties to investigate serious incidents on school trips. But the DfEE has \"no plans\" to change the current system. What should parents demand? \u0095 An information evening with a slide/video presentation of the resort. \u0095 Advance tuition at a local dry ski slope (schools may have to organise this). \u0095 Professional tuition by BASI (or European equivalent) qualified instructors at ratios of 1:10 or less. \u0095 Lift passes and ski equipment, though most operators charge extra to hire ski clothing. \u0095 Quality hotel accommodation close to ski lifts. Shared rooms with single beds are normal, but parents should expect no more than three children per room. No additional meal or lunch costs at the resort. \u0095 An evening programme - skating, swimming, pizza evening, prizes - at no extra cost. \u0095 Total financial protection. Fully-bonded ABTA membership and AITO membership should be standard. Comprehensive insurance with no excess clauses. \u0095 School ski operators in Europe should be able to offer the above for less than \u00a3500 per child.",

Investigators have even found dual passports for four players that belong to indignant Mr Capello's Roma. Their Brazilian wing-back Cafu is now a naturalised Italian citizen himself because of his wife's southern Italian ancestry. Don't try that one at your local consulate. Some cheat better than others as the authorities here know full well, and as soon as they get a chance to forget all about it they will, big names or no.",

      "body": "<p>It's a bold move, and they know it. When the people at the small but studiously trendy Edinburgh publishing house Canongate accepted an anecdotal memoir by an unknown first-time writer, they must have wondered quite what they were letting themselves in for. The Misadventures of Sylvia Smith has nothing of the current bestseller lists to recommend it - no far-flung locations, no life-or-death struggles with illness, abuse or tragic romance, no celebrity, no razzmatazz whatsoever.</p> <p>Instead, Sylvia Smith has chosen to chronicle the first 50 years of her life; an ordinary woman living an unremarkable life in a resolutely unglamorous location. It is a story of a postwar upbringing in working-class east London, of countless low status administrative and secretarial posts, of a series of cheap rented flats, all told in a collection of affectless vignettes that most resemble a kind of disjointed oral history.</p> <p>Her life and times are recounted in all their trivial detail. The effect, depending on your taste, is either cumulatively hypnotic or agonisingly anti-climactic. The sheer banality of the episodes that Smith recounts makes Misadventures feel entirely without literary forebears, but it is a strange, unsettling and oddly moving read. If the book succeeds, it will be because it gives voice to one ordinary woman's life, of the kind rarely commemorated in autobiographical writing.</p> <p>Sylvia Smith herself also cuts an unusual literary figure, not least because she claims to be talentless. She reckons her book appeals not only because it's \"hysterically funny\" but also because she's used \"good English all the way through\". She repeatedly asserts: \"I'm a lousy writer. I'm sure I am\" - and there is no hint that she might be angling for contradiction.</p> <p>Now 55, Smith has no literary training. She simply started writing at top speed one day, she says,when illness brought a halt to a long succession of temping jobs.</p> <p>Her writing is evidently more than a hobby, but something less than a vocation - she has to fit it around her daily excursions in an old banger, and time spent caring for her elderly mother.</p> <p>But while lacking writerly self-regard, Smith is not so disingenuous as to believe her work uninteresting. She has an unshakeable conviction that her material, while not essentially dramatic, is utterly fascinating.

      "bodyText": "It's a bold move, and they know it. When the people at the small but studiously trendy Edinburgh publishing house Canongate accepted an anecdotal memoir by an unknown first-time writer, they must have wondered quite what they were letting themselves in for. The Misadventures of Sylvia Smith has nothing of the current bestseller lists to recommend it - no far-flung locations, no life-or-death struggles with illness, abuse or tragic romance, no celebrity, no razzmatazz whatsoever. Instead, Sylvia Smith has chosen to chronicle the first 50 years of her life; an ordinary woman living an unremarkable life in a resolutely unglamorous location. It is a story of a postwar upbringing in working-class east London, of countless low status administrative and secretarial posts, of a series of cheap rented flats, all told in a collection of affectless vignettes that most resemble a kind of disjointed oral history. Her life and times are recounted in all their trivial detail. The effect, depending on your taste, is either cumulatively hypnotic or agonisingly anti-climactic. The sheer banality of the episodes that Smith recounts makes Misadventures feel entirely without literary forebears, but it is a strange, unsettling and oddly moving read. If the book succeeds, it will be because it gives voice to one ordinary woman's life, of the kind rarely commemorated in autobiographical writing. Sylvia Smith herself also cuts an unusual literary figure, not least because she claims to be talentless. She reckons her book appeals not only because it's \"hysterically funny\" but also because she's used \"good English all the way through\". She repeatedly asserts: \"I'm a lousy writer. I'm sure I am\" - and there is no hint that she might be angling for contradiction. Now 55, Smith has no literary training. She simply started writing at top speed one day, she says,when illness brought a halt to a long succession of temping jobs. Her writing is evidently more than a hobby, but something less than a vocation - she has to fit it around her daily excursions in an old banger, and time spent caring for her elderly mother. But while lacking writerly self-regard, Smith is not so disingenuous as to believe her work uninteresting. She has an unshakeable conviction that her material, while not essentially dramatic, is utterly fascinating. Having never come into contact with the literary world, she had no reason to be intimidated by it, but neither was she inclined to preciousness: when the first agent she approached told her she wrote very badly indeed, she could only agree. Nonetheless, it is her own style, and she is sticking to it. \"I don't like the way other people write, they go into great detail and weave a story,\" she says. \"I much prefer to get to the point.\" And get to the point she does. Apart from a handful of slightly lengthier pieces about her childhood and her family life, very few of Smith's vignettes extend to more than one page.

She had lived with her family until marrying at the age of 22 and then my father had taken charge. I was her only child and the last of her family as she had outlived her brothers and sisters.</p> <p>I visited her twice a week and I quickly discovered that old age had set in and she wasn't good at anything. Important letters would drop on her doormat. She would open them, totally misread them, panic, and then telephone me in my furnished flatlet some two towns away, telling me disaster was imminient.</p> <p>She usually phoned around 7pm when I was cooking my evening meal. As she worried me, I would switch off the oven, remove my partly cooked dinner, jump into my car and drive to her as quickly as I possibly could, only to find there was nothing wrong and the letters did not mention the disaster she had related. After several panic-stricken calls from Mother, resulting in several of my dinners being ruined, I told her she was not to open the post any more but to save it until I came round to see her and I would deal with it.</p> <p>As I was unemployed but had some savings and was able to run a car, I would collect Mother's pension once a fortnight and then take her shopping in a nearby supermarket. We would have lunch in the cafe, then buy a beautiful bunch of flowers and place them on Father's grave in Chingford cemetery. As the notorious Kray family's graves were only 50 yards away, Mother and I would stop at their tombstones. We frequently saw fresh flowers in their pots beneath their headstones. Mother would say: \"What evil men they were,\" then laugh, and add: \"If they could hear me, they'd follow us home, wouldn't they?\"</p> <p>Mother suffered from severe tinnitus which made her very deaf. The telephone was in the hall and Mother could not hear it if it rang while she was watching television in her parlour. She asked me if I would phone British Telecom and arrange for a bell to be fitted within the room.</p> <p>I phoned BT to discover that Father had rented the same telephone for the previous 32 years, at a cost of over \u00a3300. After discussion with BT's executive, I cancelled the rented telephone and purchased a modern one for the small sum of \u00a320, thereby reducing the quarterly bill, and the bell was installed free of charge.</p> <p>As I didn't possess a washing machine, I would take my weekly wash to Mother and leave her to put it in her automatic machine and get it dry for me. For several months, I wondered why my bath towels and sweaters were rock hard. A friend told me too much detergent was being used.</p> <p>As Mother's washing was in the same condition, I realised my friend was right. I advised Mother not to put any more soap in the wash. After several weeks of soap-free washes, the bath towels and sweaters became soft again. Mother switched to detergent tablets which she found not so confusing as the concentrated liquid she had been using.</p> <p>Mother decided she would like new casement curtains for the bathroom. We went down her local high street and chose the material. As I had a brand new sewing machine, it was decided I should be the one to make them. The following day, I found I had mislaid my note telling me the length of the bathroom window. I phoned Mother and asked her to quickly measure it. She returned to the phone and said: \"The window measures 3ft 15in.\" I thanked her and said no more. I measured the window on my next visit.</p> <p>On one trip to Mother, she told me the electric kettle wasn't working. I filled it up and pushed the plug into the socket on the wall and found she was right. \"You're right,\" I said. \"It isn't working.\" Mother said: \"The fridge light is out as well.\" As we had two old electric kettles stored away, I took them both out of the cupboard and filled them with water, only to discover they didn't work either.

Mr Hampton was part of the team that performed radical surgery on British Gas - spinning off BG, the oil and gas exploration unit, leaving the consumer services company Centrica. </p> <p>Many are looking for the first signs of how he will revitalise BT. </p> <p>The company has told the City that there will be no unwelcome surprises in store, and is expected to report pretax profits of about \u00a31bn, compared with \u00a3652m for the same period last year. </p> <p>A spokesman for the company said that only a progress report should be expected on the restructuring plan that was laid out last April - in which the wireless, internet, directories, and fixed line wholesale and retail businesses become separate entities. </p> <p>BT will, for the first time, provide a limited breakdown of the earnings and debt of its various divisions. </p> <p>When it launched its plan last year the corporate world was gripped by internet fervour. That sentiment has since evaporated and it is no surprise that BT's plan has been radically changed. The company had hoped to float 25% of Yell, its directories business, and a portion of BT Wireless. With the downward trend of telecoms share prices, investors are worried those floats may be halted. </p> <p>Without the promise of income from floating those companies, Mr Hampton has had to reassess how BT will reduce its \u00a330bn debt by a third this year - a promise made in November when the last earnings were released. </p> <p>Debt levels have rocketed from \u00a38.7bn at the time of the March 2000 balance sheet to an expected \u00a331bn by the end of next month. </p> <p>BT insiders complain that too much is being made of the group's gearing. \"We got into debt on purpose,\" said one. \"But we're being treated as though we're students with an overdraft.\" </p> <p>When the company had limited borrowings, it was lambasted for not investing in future technologies, the same source said. Now the company has - with money ploughed into the new generation of mobile phones - and the debt is significant, it is being cast as \"profligate\". </p> <p>Analysts are curious to see how Mr Hampton will distribute the debt among BT's divisions. Most of the debt was acquired by the mobile arm through the acquisition of the German mobile operator Viag Interkom, along with the purchase of licences to run the new, next generation mobile networks. </p> <p>Swapping BT's group borrowings among the new businesses is made more difficult by regulator Oftel, which has to give the green light to any debt redistribution. </p> <p>What might be viewed as prudent by the regulator is often seen as heavyhanded by BT. \"It's difficult to be entrepreneurial when you're regulated,\" said one insider. </p> <p>Despite the obstacles in BT's way, there is hope among financial institutions that Mr Hampton's experience with British Gas will prove useful for negotiating with the regulator. </p> <p>Mr Hampton, 48, has a background over which the finance world can enthuse. He came to British Gas from British Steel, where he served as finance director between 1991 and 1996. This followed 15 years of international accountancy work with London-based Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Lazard Brothers. </p> <p>\"He is certainly seen as the magic healer for BT's problems and he does have a good track record,\" said Hannes Wittig, research analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. \"But one person cannot change this around. He's not in charge of the company, he's in charge of solving a problem he inherited.\" </p> <p>While shareholders are pushing for an answer regarding Yell and BT Wireless's fate, the telecoms industry and Oftel are hammering BT on how slowly it is opening up access to local exchanges - a move seen as essential for allowing rivals to offer high speed internet access. </p> <p>BT has had weeks of bad publicity as competing operators claim it is stonewalling their attempts to use local exchanges, a process known as \"unbundling the local loop\". Rivals are rolling back ambitious projects that the government and others had hoped would make Britain a high speed internet mecca. </p> <p>BT denies any foot-dragging and insists it is being made a scapegoat by companies who, thanks to antipathy in the capital markets, can no longer raise the money to fund those ambitious projects. </p> <p>The timidity of the markets has also cast a pall of uncertainty over BT's own valuation, particularly as it has not yet separated accounting for its various divisions. While the share price has ranged from \u00a315 to 650p over the last year, most analysts think it should be valued at between 750p and 850p. </p> <p>\"The situation is obscured,\" said Mr Wittig. \"Even people close to the company don't know what it's worth any more. I think this obscurity is to BT's advantage.\" </p> <p> Additional reporting by Richard Thurston</p>",

Debt levels have rocketed from \u00a38.7bn at the time of the March 2000 balance sheet to an expected \u00a331bn by the end of next month. BT insiders complain that too much is being made of the group's gearing. \"We got into debt on purpose,\" said one. \"But we're being treated as though we're students with an overdraft.\" When the company had limited borrowings, it was lambasted for not investing in future technologies, the same source said. Now the company has - with money ploughed into the new generation of mobile phones - and the debt is significant, it is being cast as \"profligate\". Analysts are curious to see how Mr Hampton will distribute the debt among BT's divisions. Most of the debt was acquired by the mobile arm through the acquisition of the German mobile operator Viag Interkom, along with the purchase of licences to run the new, next generation mobile networks. Swapping BT's group borrowings among the new businesses is made more difficult by regulator Oftel, which has to give the green light to any debt redistribution. What might be viewed as prudent by the regulator is often seen as heavyhanded by BT. \"It's difficult to be entrepreneurial when you're regulated,\" said one insider. Despite the obstacles in BT's way, there is hope among financial institutions that Mr Hampton's experience with British Gas will prove useful for negotiating with the regulator. Mr Hampton, 48, has a background over which the finance world can enthuse. He came to British Gas from British Steel, where he served as finance director between 1991 and 1996. This followed 15 years of international accountancy work with London-based Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Lazard Brothers. \"He is certainly seen as the magic healer for BT's problems and he does have a good track record,\" said Hannes Wittig, research analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. \"But one person cannot change this around. He's not in charge of the company, he's in charge of solving a problem he inherited.\" While shareholders are pushing for an answer regarding Yell and BT Wireless's fate, the telecoms industry and Oftel are hammering BT on how slowly it is opening up access to local exchanges - a move seen as essential for allowing rivals to offer high speed internet access. BT has had weeks of bad publicity as competing operators claim it is stonewalling their attempts to use local exchanges, a process known as \"unbundling the local loop\". Rivals are rolling back ambitious projects that the government and others had hoped would make Britain a high speed internet mecca. BT denies any foot-dragging and insists it is being made a scapegoat by companies who, thanks to antipathy in the capital markets, can no longer raise the money to fund those ambitious projects. The timidity of the markets has also cast a pall of uncertainty over BT's own valuation, particularly as it has not yet separated accounting for its various divisions. While the share price has ranged from \u00a315 to 650p over the last year, most analysts think it should be valued at between 750p and 850p. \"The situation is obscured,\" said Mr Wittig. \"Even people close to the company don't know what it's worth any more. I think this obscurity is to BT's advantage.\" Additional reporting by Richard Thurston",

The cash-strapped company last night said it had secured \u00a333m from existing and new investors, despite widespread concerns over the strength of Letsbuyit's business model. It is believed Kim Schmitz, the flamboyant German who was expected to ride to the company's rescue, is not one of the financiers. Letsbuyit allows consumers to group together and buy goods over the net, but the idea did not generate enough sales and the company was forced to seek court protection from its creditors. However, the UK-based firm said it expects to make a profit in November 2002 and has enough cash to survive beyond that date. \"The lawyers of the company jointly with management are currently preparing a request for withdrawal of the debt moratorium at the earliest possible date,\" Letsbuyit said in a statement. Letsbuyit will attempt to hit its targets by undergoing a radical restructuring of the company, which will include laying off 200 of its 350 staff and shutting down several foreign units. The revamp will be led by founder John Palmer, who became chief executive following the departure of Letsbuyit's senior management team. So far, the company's rescuers have been reluctant to come forward, although German venture capital firm Kimvestor admitted it has invested \u00a3760,000 and was willing to contribute more. Letsbuyit's shares, which floated at 223p, rose a staggering 112% to 70p in early trading on the German Neuer Markt index.",

      "bodyText": "Palestinian militants said last night that they were poised to attack targets in Israel on the eve of today's election, which is expected to make Ariel Sharon the country's next prime minister. The warning came as Israeli soldiers tried to tighten their grip on the West Bank and Gaza Strip before the \"day of rage\" which leaders of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement say marks the start of an intensification of the four-month uprising. The army fired rocket-propelled grenades into the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah, on the border between Gaza and Egypt, after an Israeli soldier on his way to vote in the early ballot staged for the army was killed by a bullet fired from the camp. Israel also shut down the Palestinian airport in Gaza and the Rafah crossing to Egypt. Police reinforcements were moved to the northern towns in Galilee, where a call for Israeli Arabs to boycott the election could lead to clashes. With yesterday's opinion polls showing him leading the incumbent prime minister, Ehud Barak, by as much as 22 points, Mr Sharon could be stepping into a ready-made confrontation. Yesterday he was challenged not only by the Fatah militias, which have led the protests in the West Bank and Gaza, but also by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which has claimed responsibility for at least two car bombings in Israel in the past four months. \"Our operations will continue and increase. We will carry out powerful blows against the criminal entity within the coming few days,\" Islamic Jihad said in a statement delivered before yesterday's funeral of a bomber who was shot dead trying to scale the fence sealing off Gaza. \"No barriers, wire fences, or security measures will prevent us from carrying out painful strikes against the enemy.\" In the West Bank city of Ramallah, meanwhile, an important Fatah leader declared that the Palestinians would give no quarter to Mr Sharon. Hussein Sheikh, who commands Fatah's militiamen in the West Bank, said: \"The next days and weeks are going to be hard, and the area will witness an escalation in the field. \"We have declared a general state of emergency and we have orders to escalate the intifada.\" Mr Barak spent the final moments of his campaign yesterday warning Israelis that the former general Sharon could lead them into a war. \"The Middle East is a powder keg,\" he wrote in the Yediot Ahronoth, Israel's best-selling paper. \"We are being called to decide whether to give the match to extremists, people who are too extreme for Israel. We are being called to decide whether between us and peace lies another bloody war.\" But Israelis seemed to be in no mood to listen. After four months of bloodshed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, people have lost faith not only in Mr Barak but in the entire seven years of negotiations started by the assassinated prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, according to research published yesterday by the Israel Democracy Institute. An opinion survey carried out last month found that only 22% of Israelis believed that a peace deal with the Palestinians would end nearly 53 years of violence. Two years ago the figure was 67%. \"Israelis feel that the track Rabin, and especially Barak, took was leading to an agreement having many concessions but no end of conflict, and no solution to problems of personal security,\" said Ruth Gavison, from the institute. \"Many Israelis feel that what we now have is not a full war, but it is definitely not peace, and the way Barak is leading could lead into a worse war.\" In his place Israelis are expected to choose a man who says he has no intention of negotiating with the Palestinians for years, and who last year called on Mr Barak to crush the uprising by assassinating Gaza's security chief. How big the turnout will be is another question, however. In Ramallah Mr Sheikh declared: \"If the choice is war, it is better for Palestinians to deal with Sharon .Sharon has a clear vision. It is better for us to deal with someone who clearly wants to fight us and have war rather than deal with someone who raises flag of peace and then wages war.\" Related articles Timeline 06.02.2001: Fear spurs voters into the arms of Sharon 06.02.2001: Make or break vote lies with Russians 06.02.2001, Neal Ascherson: So close to peace, so far away 30.01.2001, Matthew Engel: Sorry world, I'm going under cover Talk about it Interactive guide An interactive history of Israel Audio Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35) Key players Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Barak: the main loser Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine' From the Guardian archive 15.05.1948: Jewish state is born 19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation Useful links Office of the Israeli Prime Minister Peace process: reference documents in full Israeli Knesset Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat Jerusalem Post Palestine Times",

The payments were declared in the register of MPs' interests, but the money was not passed onto the local party. </p> <p> Defence: The current local party treasurer, Piara Singh Clair, who made the allegation in the Sunday Telegraph, did not have access to the local election fund books, adminstered by party agent Keith Bennett. Mr Bennett has insisted all the money has been properly accounted. </p> <p> Analysis: The election expenses officially returned by the Leicester East local party show that Mr Vaz's party was entitled to spend \u00a37,678.54 and in fact submitted an expenses return of \u00a36,521. This would imply that Mr Vaz should have passed on just under \u00a38,500 to the local party. The party now claims the surplus cash is set aside for use in the coming election, which is why it never appeared to the normal local party accounts. Alternative explanations are that Mr Clair is mistaken about the records, or Mr Vaz overspent, or the money went elsewhere, possibly because it was spent before the election expenses limit came into force. </p> <p> <b> The proposed \u00a3900,000 house purchase</b> </p> <p> Allegation: Mr Vaz made an offer on a \u00a3900,000 London house when he himself could claim very limited funds from his role as an MP and treasurer. Mr Vaz is unlikely to be able to draw on extensive personal funds as he started employment as a humble council solicitor. </p> <p> Defence: The money for this propery came not just from Mr Vaz, but also from his successful wife who is a solicitor and from his mother and sister. His mother and his wife run Mapesbury Communication Ltd, which made a \u00a348,000 profit in 1998 and a \u00a312,000 profit in 1999. Mr Vaz's own property is worth around \u00a3400,000. </p> <p> Analysis: Three to four people with regular incomes purchasing a house together can raise substantial sums. </p> <p> <b> The Hindujas</b> </p> <p> Allegation: Mr Vaz offered to top and tail letters on behalf of the billionaire Hinduja brothers, including lobbying on their behalf for a passport. He met the brothers, who are not his constituents, very soon after they were named as suspects in an illegal arms deal, over which they faced extradition to India. </p> <p> Defence: He has accepted that he did seek information from the Home Office about the Hindujas' passport applications and knew the brothers well. He says he had a duty to support and represent all Asians, not just his constituents. He says no money was exchanged in return for favours.</p> <p> Analysis: Some former ministers have claimed that it was normal practice for MPs to lobby for passports on behalf of individuals who were not their constituents. No clear rule exists in the MPs' code of conduct, but senior Labour MPs claim it is legitimate for MPs to seek information on behalf of someone if they are not their constituent, so long as they are not lobbying or financially indebted. Mr Vaz's wife at the very least has received money from the Hindujas and Mr Vaz may not have made this point clear at the relevant times. SP Hinduja said he consulted Mr Vaz as to what protection from extradition British citizenship would provide. </p> <p> Allegation: Mr Vaz used his premises in the Foreign Office to host a meeting between a Labour supporting Asian restauranteur and an insurance firm over a fire claim. </p> <p> Defence: Ministerial code of conduct only states that ministers should not \"generally\" use ministerial offices for party or constituency business </p> <p> Analysis: The code clearly does allow exemptions in times of necessity. Changes to Mr Vaz's diary required the meeting to be held in his office. </p> <p><b> Intimidation of party members</b> </p> <p> Allegation: Mr Vaz had a hand in seeking to suppress allegations passed by local party members against him to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Elizabeth Filkin. This is part of a pattern of intimidation in his local party. On May 8 2000 local party chairman Colin Hall wrote to Mustafa Kamal, a local party member, warning him that unless he substantiated or withdrew his allegations, he would be subject to disciplininary action. </p> <p> Defence: There is no clear evidence that Mr Vaz referred the allegations to the local party. Mr Kamal had erred in that his complaints concerned the local party, and not Mr Vaz's role as an MP. </p> <p> Analysis: No one making allegations to Ms Filkin should be subjected to such threats since they are covered by parliamentary privilege. Allegations that the local party was improperly run by Mr Vaz were never substantiated in a party report prepared in 1996, but some claim that inquiry ended prematurely. </p> <p><b> Undeclared cash payments</b> </p> <p> Allegation: Lawyer Sarosh Zaiwalla has told the Commons standards and privileges committee that he gave Mr Vaz over \u00a32,000 in cash which was never declared. He insists details of the cash paid to Mr Vaz are in his accounts. </p> <p> Defence: Mr Vaz has not denied the cash was passed to his associates, but insists that it never went to him personally, but instead to charities. </p> <p> Analysis: Probably the single biggest issue to be investigated by Ms Filkin and may not be decided for many months. </p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,434086,00.html\">06.02.2001: MPs may delay Vaz report until after election</a><br> <a href=\"\u0094http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,433608,00.html&quot;\">05.02.2001: Media hounding Vaz, says Cook</a><br> <a href=\"\u0094http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,432928,00.html&quot;\">03.02.2001: Blair backs Vaz over latest sleaze allegation</a><br> <a href=\"\u0094http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,428626,00.html\u0094\"> 26.01.20001: Passport row: net spreads</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429192,00.html\u0094\">Profile: Keith Vaz</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,428644,00.html\">26.01.20001: The hospitable Hindujas and the wooing of the Westminster classes</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.fco.gov.uk/directory/dynpage.asp?Page=221\u0094\" target=\"\u0094_new\u0094\"> Keith Vaz \u0096 Foreign Office</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "CNN's coverage of George Bush's rise to power has been branded \"a debacle\" by three academics it hired to investigate how it got it so wrong on the election night. The station has unveiled a major overhaul of its presidential election exit poll procedures following the damning report into the mistaken calls made by the news network and other broadcasters in November. But CNN was by no means the only US broadcaster to come in for criticism. \"Television interfered with the electoral process and the election result,\" said the independent report written by three respected academics for CNN. \"In our opinion, that constitutes an abuse of power, if unintentionally so, by CNN and by all the mainstream television news operations,\" it added. Voters' News Service, the body set up by ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and AP to provide exit poll data for projections and analysis, was singled out in for particular criticism. The report said the decision to set up VNS as a cost-cutting measure that created a single source of exit poll information for all the broadcasters was \"questionable\". The academics - Jim Risser, a former director of the Knight Fellowship, Joan Konner, a professor at Columbia University's school of journalism, and Ben Wattenberg, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute - took two months to complete their report. \"It eliminates the possibility of a second source for validating key and possibly conflicting information,\" they said. In addition, all the networks were competing to be the first to \"call\" different states for Republican George Bush or his Democrat opponent Al Gore using VNS data. In these circumstances, the report concluded that Florida, which the US networks called wrongly twice - first for Mr Gore and then for Mr Bush - when the result was still so close, \"was a disaster waiting to happen\". It said: \"In sum, the mistaken calls made television in election 2000 look foolish\". The report concluded: \"It also threw one state and the nation and the campaigns themselves into confusion and helped lead one candidate into prematurely conceding to the other.\" CNN said it would remain in VNS \"only if significant changes are made to assure that the errors that plagued election night coverage do not recur\". The news broadcaster has also pledged to fund a second source of exit poll data, to cross-check with VNS statistics. It will no longer call the presidential winner of a state until all polls have closed in that state and will also avoid making any exit poll projections in states which are statistically - a margin of less than 1% - too close to call. CNN is also planning to provide more coverage of the mechanics of how exit poll calls are arrived at and be clearer about how it labels unconfirmed projections on air. \"Despite the best intentions and weeks of news department preparations prior to the election, for a variety of reasons, CNN and the other networks fell short in their coverage of election night,\" CNN said. \"We do not intend to let that happen again.\"",

      "bodyText": "Former Castaway Ben Fogle is to join Hello! as a roving travel reporter. The signing of the former Tatler picture editor, who won over viewers' hearts on the BBC's reality show, ends weeks of speculation about his career. It is the first major coup for former News of the World editor Phil Hall, who has taken the helm as editor-in chief at the magazine. Mr Fogle, with his blue-blood credentials, is seen as an essential part of the drive to make Hello! more upmarket and hip. Mr Hall told MediaGuardian.co.uk that Mr Fogle was \"popular and glamorous - everything we need\". He added: \"He's adventurous, he's done a lot of travelling and he's interested in environmental issues.\" Mr Hall said he was discussing sending Mr Fogle to the Galapagos islands. Bringing his years of experience as a hard-nosed reporter to the sycophantic publication, Mr Hall told a newspaper today he wanted to make Hello! more glamorous and hip: \"The suck-up stuff has become too cheesy. \"It is embarrassing to see see questions like, 'Leo, your hair is looking great, where did you get it done?'. What I want to know is why Leo hasn't spoken to his brother in four months. We don't want to turn celebrities over, but we can't keep on asking embarrassing questions like that.\" Mr Hall also confirmed the magazine's \"special relationship\" with the Daily Mail in the wake of OK! publisher Richard Desmond's tie-up with the Express. \"We want to build up relationships with all the national newspapers,\" he said. \"But the Mail does make a lot of sense, in particular. [Mail owner] Lord Rothermere has met [Hello! owner] Eduardo [Sanchez Junco] in Spain - they went shooting together - and they are meeting again in the next few weeks. \"It's a non-exclusive relationship, but it is very important to us,\" he said. Mr Hall added that he would approach the Mail to share the costs of buying certain stories which could then be cross-promoted. He has also revealed that he is working on plans to develop a television show based on the Hello! brand. He was unwiling to reveal too much detail about plans for the show, but said he had been approached by one independent producer interested in making a fly-on-the-wall about life inside the celebrity glossy. But he said there were \"contractual\" problems with this.",

      "bodyText": "Greg Dyke has told BBC staff he plans to up the programming budget by 24% by the end of 2002/3. In an address to staff yesterday, BBC director general reiterated his pledge to boost BBC1 and BBC 2 schedules with an extra \u00a3131m for the two stations next year. But he told staff the extra money could only come from further cost-cutting which will inevitably mean redundancies. Mr Dyke said he still had to cut a further \u00a328m in running costs by the end of the year 2001/2002 to achieve targets. In a broad-ranging speech, the director general said the BBC has trimmed \u00a34m more from its operations than was planned when his One BBC strategy was announced last year. The BBC has to make overall savings of \u00a3146m a year by the end of 2003/4. Cost-cutting under the plan has cut \u00a35m, and an additional \u00a320m has been cut from different parts of the organisation. Mr Dyke also announced he had cut the amount of money spent on management consultants by 85%. And he reviewed other changes made over the course of the year, including the BBC's planned new digital services, and new targets for ethnic representation among staff. But BBC staff were underwhelmed by the director-general's first year anniversary speech. One insider said most staff, jaded by problems on the London Underground, had been too busy \"getting on with their jobs\" to pay too much attention to the address.

      "bodyText": "Ministers have come under renewed pressure to abandon their policy on long term care for the elderly after the Liberal Democrats pledged to make it an election issue. The government wants free nursing care for the elderly in residential homes, but has rejected calls to make personal care - help with washing, eating and dressing, for example - available for free. MPs will today debate the issue at the parliamentary standing committee scrutinising the health and social care bill. The Liberal Democrats are expected to press for an amendment to the bill to enable free personal care, although it is unlikely to succeed given Labour's inbuilt majority on the committee. The government's own royal commission on long term care headed by Sir Stewart Sutherland recommended that personal care should be funded by the taxpayer. But ministers refused to support this proposal, arguing that it would not be cost effective. Yesterday the government defended its stance on long term care in a Commons debate called by the Liberal Democrats. Health minister Gisele Stuart said its policy would lead to better services for old people. The Conservatives supported the government, saying the cost of free care would be better spent elsewhere in the NHS, even though the Tories in Scotland have backed the Liberal Democrats in campaining for free personal care north of the border Last month the Scottish executive provoked the wrath of the UK government after it pushed ahead with proposals to accept the Sutherland report recommendations in full, after coming under pressure from the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party in the Scottish parliament. The Liberal Democrats said yesterday that free personal care for the elderly would be a central plank of the party's health policy in its manifesto for the general election. Party leader Charles Kennedy called for a UK wide debate on \"delivering a care system fair and fit for all\" and warned that Labour's policy would not lift the pressure on elderly people forced to sell their homes to pay for their care.",

      "bodyText": "Sue Farr, the BBC's former director of public service marketing, has finally signed up for a new job with the PR giant responsible for promoting McDonald's, Lloyds bank and Daimler cars. Seven months after she quit the BBC, Ms Farr has landed a job as regional managing director for US PR firm Golin Harris. At Golin Harris she will oversee operations in Europe, the middle east and Africa with effect from tomorrow. She replaces Mary Bartholomew who retired at the end of last year. \"After seven tremendous years at the BBC, I am delighted to have been offered this fantastic opportunity,\" said Ms Farr. Golin Harris is a class act. I look forward to continuing the firm's success and helping to build the Golin Harris brand in London and the rest of the Europe.\" Ms Farr left the BBC after Greg Dyke overlooked her for the job of marketing director in charge of the corporation's \u00a373m marketing budget. Mr Dyke appointed Matthew Bannister instead, but Mr Bannister quit the \u00a3180,000 job, and the BBC, in October after only six months in the role. At the time of Mr Bannister's appointment to the top marketing job, many within the marketing, advertising and media industries expressed surprise that Mr Dyke had not handed the post to Ms Farr, not least because Bannister had no direct experience of marketing. Ms Farr will preside over offices in London, Frankfurt and Madrid and will be responsible for opening new offices across the region. Golin Harris' client list includes McDonald's, DaimlerChrysler, pharmaceutical company Bayer Corporation, Lloyds TSB, Bass Brewers and Samsung. Prior to her tenure with the BBC, Ms Farr held several marketing and communications positions with Thames Television and ad agencies WCRS, Bates Dorland and CDP. She is chairman of the Marketing Group of Great Britain and is also a member of Forum UK, the Women's Advertising Club of London, the Royal Television Society and the Institute of Directors. Julia Thorn, chief executive of Golin Harris' London office is to retire on March 31 after more than 25 years in the PR business.",

      "bodyText": "Fat Friends and Playing the Field scriptwriter Kay Mellor is graduating from TV and moving to the big screen. She is making a feature-length film of her West End play A Passionate Woman, a romantic comedy about a woman's mid-life crisis. It is the second feature film by Ms Mellor, who made her name with the ITV drama Band of Gold starring Cathy Tyson and Geraldine James. And it explains why ITV has not been able to persuade her to do another Fat Friends and why the hit BBC drama Playing the Field is also coming to an end. She is working on the feature with the Scala Productions, the company which produced her 1999 directorial debut Fanny and Elvis, which starred Ray Winstone and Kerry Fox. The big-screen version of A Passionate Woman will see Mellor back in Yorkshire, where Fanny and Elvis was shot. Production will begin late this summer and the film is due for a 2002 release. The story centres on a post-menopausal woman, Betty Stephenson, and her relationship with a man called Craze. The action opens in 1990s Yorkshire with Betty reminiscing about how she met Craze. Much of the movie is taken up with a series of flashbacks to the 1950s showing Betty as a young woman and charting her relationship with Craze. Talks are underway with several British actors about taking the lead parts, but names remain under wraps. Fanny and Elvis, a classic will-they-won't-they comedy, centred on a romantic novelist in a desperate search for a man to father her child. Jennifer Saunders and Ms Mellor's youngest daughter Gaynor Faye, better known as Coronation Street's Judy Mallett, also appeared in the film. Ms Mellor, famed for her gritty but humorous tales of northern folk, wrote A Passionate Woman in 1993 for the West Yorkshire Playhouse inspired by her mother's extramarital affair. The play transferred to the West End where it ran for more than a year. The author is also in talks with Tiger Aspect Productions about another feature film project.",

      "body": "<p>Alder Hey children's hospital yesterday dismissed claims by a disgraced pathologist that he never knowingly took body parts from babies without their parents' consent.</p> <p>Dick van Velzen was found by an independent inquiry last week to have illegally stripped body parts from hundreds of children who had died at the Liverpool hospital between 1988 and 1995. He had falsified reports and removed medical records while the organs lay in jars in dusty storerooms.</p> <p>The Dutch pathologist, who is under police protection in Amsterdam, broke his silence this weekend to tell the BBC that the hospital was to blame for not telling parents what would happen to their children's bodies.</p> <p>He said he removed organs in postmortems performed with parental consent and followed international protocol. He said problems had only arisen because the hospital had forgotten to explain to parents what a post-mortem was. \"It is terrible,\" he said. \"It is not my fault.\"</p> <p>Tony Bell, acting chief executive of Alder Hey hospital, responded yesterday: \"I do not believe that Professor van Velzen thought that he had consent. He claimed he was adopting international protocols in taking the entire organs system. But if that was the case he should have communicated it to the staff involved in obtaining consent.\"</p> <p>Mr Bell brushed aside the pathologist's threats to name 40 members of hospital staff allegedly involved in concealing the organ stockpile.</p> <p>\"There are many names in the Redfern report. There is no secrecy. But if the professor has any new names, we would welcome any new evidence.\"</p> <p>James Underwood, vice-president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said he found Prof van Velzen's line of defence \"surprising\".</p> <p>He said the pathologist had failed to address the most serious findings of the official inquiry report that he had taken material specifically against parental wishes and falsified autopsy reports.</p> <p>\"What happened at Alder Hey, particularly under the direction of Prof van Velzen, was unacceptable and very different in nature and scale from postmortem practises in the rest of the UK. He had ample time to respond to the report's findings before they were published. If he wishes to challenge the findings now he will have to produce fresh evidence.\"</p> <p>Ed Bradley, chairman of the Alder Hey parents support group, said Prof van Velzen's comments were arrogant. \"I think in his interview he has been extremely patronising, saying that parents didn't know what taking tissue meant.

      "bodyText": "Alder Hey children's hospital yesterday dismissed claims by a disgraced pathologist that he never knowingly took body parts from babies without their parents' consent. Dick van Velzen was found by an independent inquiry last week to have illegally stripped body parts from hundreds of children who had died at the Liverpool hospital between 1988 and 1995. He had falsified reports and removed medical records while the organs lay in jars in dusty storerooms. The Dutch pathologist, who is under police protection in Amsterdam, broke his silence this weekend to tell the BBC that the hospital was to blame for not telling parents what would happen to their children's bodies. He said he removed organs in postmortems performed with parental consent and followed international protocol. He said problems had only arisen because the hospital had forgotten to explain to parents what a post-mortem was. \"It is terrible,\" he said. \"It is not my fault.\" Tony Bell, acting chief executive of Alder Hey hospital, responded yesterday: \"I do not believe that Professor van Velzen thought that he had consent. He claimed he was adopting international protocols in taking the entire organs system. But if that was the case he should have communicated it to the staff involved in obtaining consent.\" Mr Bell brushed aside the pathologist's threats to name 40 members of hospital staff allegedly involved in concealing the organ stockpile. \"There are many names in the Redfern report. There is no secrecy. But if the professor has any new names, we would welcome any new evidence.\" James Underwood, vice-president of the Royal College of Pathologists, said he found Prof van Velzen's line of defence \"surprising\". He said the pathologist had failed to address the most serious findings of the official inquiry report that he had taken material specifically against parental wishes and falsified autopsy reports. \"What happened at Alder Hey, particularly under the direction of Prof van Velzen, was unacceptable and very different in nature and scale from postmortem practises in the rest of the UK. He had ample time to respond to the report's findings before they were published. If he wishes to challenge the findings now he will have to produce fresh evidence.\" Ed Bradley, chairman of the Alder Hey parents support group, said Prof van Velzen's comments were arrogant. \"I think in his interview he has been extremely patronising, saying that parents didn't know what taking tissue meant. It goes back to the paternalism in the health service.\" But Mr Bradley said that while he rejected Prof van Velzen's defence, others should share the blame. \"They should have had the courage, conscience and professionalism to come forward and say what we are doing here is unethical and unlawful.\" Talk about it Health minister live online John Hutton was live online today.

Although Welsh rockers the Stereophonics are proud to be MU members - they even make an appearance on the union's website - rock and pop performers have long since lost touch with whatever it is the union is supposed to do for its rank and file. </p> <p>\"A long time ago, all the artists that this office represented left the union,\" says former Dire Straits manager Ed Bicknell. \"People used to say to me, 'What does the union do?' I couldn't answer them because I didn't know. Certainly for people working in contemporary music, as opposed to maybe people in dance bands or pit orchestras, there was no perceptible benefit that they could see.\" </p> <p>The Musicians' Union has long held a reputation as a left-wing, doctrinaire organisation as secretive and tight-lipped as the KGB. If it's widely known for anything, it's for imposing a labyrinth of infuriating bureaucratic restrictions on the performance or recording of music. Meanwhile, it has tended to miss the bigger picture. Bicknell remembers asking the MU what its line was on artists playing in South Africa's Sun City during the apartheid era, and getting the response that \"our members never play there\". As it happened, a major British act was playing in Sun City that very week. \"I said, 'Your members play in Sun City all the time', and he said, 'No they don't!' It was absurd; it was like they were wearing blinkers.\" </p> <p>This week the MU is getting some of the splashiest publicity in its 108-year history, but for all the wrong reasons. Yesterday 72-year-old trumpeter and MU member Freddie Staff took the union to the High Court in a an attempt to find out whether the union has failed to pay out millions of pounds owed to session musicians over a period stretching back 55 years. Staff's action comes in the wake of an EC di rective that stipulated that what used to be ex-gratia payments to musicians have now become legal entitlements. </p> <p>Bicknell explains: \"People like Freddie Staff, and maybe lots of string players who might have played on The Beatles' A Day in the Life or a Walker Brothers record, have stuck their hands in the air and said, 'Where's my money? This money was supposed to come from the MU and I haven't had any.' \" </p> <p>Not everyone agrees that the MU is the last bastion of restrictive practices. According to the London Symphony Orchestra's managing director, Clive Gillinson, \"the union is much more flexible and aware of how entrepreneurial everybody has to be now\". Pete King, who helped Ronnie Scott found his Soho jazz club in 1959, comments that \"many years ago, the club went through a very difficult financial period, and the MU assisted us financially. Generally they tried to look after their members pretty well, I think.\" </p> <p>But if the Musicians' Union had adhered to its original rigorous stance, Beatlemania would never have crossed the Atlantic. Until the end of the 1950s the MU prohibited American musicians from performing in Britain, on the grounds that they would be taking work from British musicians. The American Federation of Musicians reciprocated by keeping British artists out of the US. It was largely because of Pete King and Ronnie Scott, who wanted to bring over American jazz musicians to play in their new club, that the Union's diktat was modified. </p> <p>Bicknell worked as a booking agent in the late 1960s, and remembers how he had to manipulate the exchange system. \"Pete and Ronnie worked out an exchange system with the guy who ran the AFM in America - his name was James Petrillo and he was known as Little Caesar - and it meant that if an American musician played one gig in Britain, then a British musician would have to play one gig in America. They were called Man Days. I always used to bring in big bands because they had the most number of Man Days. For instance, if a 16-piece band like Buddy Rich's played 12 nights at Ronnie Scott's, that gave me 192 Man Days. If I had a rock trio going to America, they could play a lot longer over there.\" </p> <p>The speed of technological change has helped to leave the MU and its \"Spanish practices\" behind. It was set up to protect the rights of individual players in an age of big bands and large orchestras, when sampling and electronics hadn't been invented. The union's response to the synthesiser was to try to ban it, because it put string players out of work. </p> <p>One of the union's most celebrated absurdities was its demand that artists appearing on Top of the Pops had to re-record the backing track of their hit song in an afternoon, when they might have spent weeks in a studio creating the original recording. In practice, artists pretended to re-record the song, then used their original tapes. \"It happened to Dire Straits,\" says Bicknell. \"They sat around in the studio and drank tea, didn't do any re-recording at all, then used the studio tapes. The union's attitude was: 'This never happens.' \"</p>",

      "body": "<p>If, despite the Labour party's problems with Peter Mandelson and Keith Vaz, the Tories are still doing badly in the polls in England in advance of a general election, spare a thought for Scottish Conservatism. Its fortunes show very little sign of recovery.</p> <p>Since the 1997 general election, support for the Tories in opinion polls asking about elections for Westminster peaked at 17% in Mori polls in April 2000 and 22% in ICM polls in September 2000. In surveys of voting intentions for Scotland-only elections, the Tories did even worse, with a peak of 14% in System 3's polls in April and May 2000 and 16% in ICM's poll in September 2000. These are not figures to inspire confidence about the party's electoral prospects, especially when there are now no Scottish Tory MPs at Westminster.</p> <p>The most worrying thing for the Tory party in Scotland is that the seats it lost as long ago as 1987 were not recovered by the party come 1992, 1997 and 1999. The fear must be that the 11 seats lost in 1997 follow exactly the same pattern - lost for evermore.</p> <p>Though the elections to the new Scottish parliament in 1999 delivered 18 seats for the Tories, none of these members was elected from first past the post. All succeeded on the back of proportional representation thanks to regional party lists.

Its fortunes show very little sign of recovery. Since the 1997 general election, support for the Tories in opinion polls asking about elections for Westminster peaked at 17% in Mori polls in April 2000 and 22% in ICM polls in September 2000. In surveys of voting intentions for Scotland-only elections, the Tories did even worse, with a peak of 14% in System 3's polls in April and May 2000 and 16% in ICM's poll in September 2000. These are not figures to inspire confidence about the party's electoral prospects, especially when there are now no Scottish Tory MPs at Westminster. The most worrying thing for the Tory party in Scotland is that the seats it lost as long ago as 1987 were not recovered by the party come 1992, 1997 and 1999. The fear must be that the 11 seats lost in 1997 follow exactly the same pattern - lost for evermore. Though the elections to the new Scottish parliament in 1999 delivered 18 seats for the Tories, none of these members was elected from first past the post. All succeeded on the back of proportional representation thanks to regional party lists. Also, support for the Tories fell by 2% in 1999 compared with 1997, to a new low of 15.6% - the falling red line on the chart kept going south.

Driving home after dining out with friends, he'd seen the burning car surrounded by onlookers, fire fighters and police, but could never have imagined what the scene signified. \"I just thought there'd been an accident,\" he says. \"Then I realised I was seeing exactly the same thing on my television screen, with Jeremy Paxman explaining what was really going on - almost literally on my doorstep.\"</p> <p>From Father Gary's garden gate you get a view of where the paedophile-purgers of the Paulsgrove estate got into their stride. A municipal green slopes down from the front of St Michael and All Angels church until it meets Allaway Avenue, with its promenade of shops and the local housing office of Portsmouth city council. Facing this stands the second-floor flat where Victor Burnett, 55, used to live, and which he had vacated only hours before a group of his neighbours wanted him out.</p> <p>There'd been mutterings about Burnett since he'd moved in two years ago. But after he became one of the convicted child sex offenders \"named and shamed\" by the News of the World following the death of Sarah Payne, and after further coverage in the local press, the mutterings turned into howls of hate. Placards were brandished, missiles thrown and a police officer injured. At one point a woman, thought to have been Burnett's sister, came on the scene. Her car was turned over and torched.</p> <p>On the same day, August 3, that the News of the World bowed to pressure to stop naming and shaming, the paedophile story got fresh legs. Paulsgrove was the place where it ran. Seven months later it is still running. It took a week for Paulsgrove's dispensers of unofficial justice to extend it to a dozen or so other residents of their own or the adjoining Wymering estate, and, in the process, get the media goggling, the politicians flapping and parents everywhere worrying about predatory \"perverts\" lurking down their way.</p> <p>By contrast, the forces of conventional authority have had a lengthier task. The wheels of law and order are still turning. Fifty people were arrested during the period of the protests, 39 of whom were charged. Most of these have come before magistrates in recent weeks: the minor cases have been dealt with, the more serious will go to crown court later in the year. Meanwhile, at ground level, fears have had to be stilled and scars healed.</p> <p>\"It could have happened anywhere,\" Father Gary says as he takes me on a tour through Paulsgrove. It's not urban unrest country. Paulsgrove does not bloom with affluence, but nor does it reek of decay. Sixty per cent of its properties are owner-occupied and early residents, called \"Grovers\", maintain a pioneering spirit. Theirs, though, was not the sort of solidarity paraded by the \"perv-hunters\".</p> <p>Councillor David Horne, a resident of Paulsgrove for 36 years, describes how \"the whole estate was touched by it. If they didn't see it for themselves, they saw it on the news every night. There were lots of terrified people asking each other 'are they going to come down my street next?' Most people look on the protesters with nothing but contempt. You could say the community has united against them. Most of all, they would just like to forget.\"</p> <p>The council remains engaged in social fabric surgery. Rob Hutchinson, director of Portsmouth social services, says: \"We've got into a closer dialogue with the community; a respectable community which is articulating itself in a way that it hasn't done before. The established local groups like the tenants associations, and more recently the protesters, have been contributing in a responsible and sensible way.\"</p> <p>But getting to this stage has not been easy. The problem was establishing a dialogue with the protest organisers - Residents Against Paedophiles, as they are known - with their mobile-phone networks, business cards and mob which trailed in their wake. And once the protests were called off came the long slog of reconstruction. A \"Keep Safe\" programme has been running in the schools, and last month a Paulsgrove primary hosted the launch of council-funded child protection awareness sessions.</p> <p>Hutchinson and others have also offered reassurance that the system designed to protect the public against paedophiles works. He stresses that following previous expressions of concern, Burnett had been the subject of two public protection conferences involving social services, probation staff and the police - the standard procedure. The conclusion of both assessments was that, despite his previous record, there was no evidence that Burnett was going back to his old ways. As for the others who attracted Rap's attentions, the authorities are certain that none posed a threat. Up to 20 people were screened by social services, the probation service and the police. Of these, some had no criminal record, no charges pending, nor even any previously recorded allegation of criminal activity. Others did have convictions, of which some were for sexual offences. But these were not against young children and, in one case, had been committed many years ago with no subsequent reoffending.</p> <p>In short, all the protesters' targets subsequent to Burnett were victims of rumour, gossip and, in some cases, sheer spite. Nor were those besieged and terrorised inside their homes the only victims, according to Superintendent Bob Golding who was in charge of policing: \"There are the children who witnessed the demos or took part; some of them were only four or five years old. Then there were others in the area, intimidated by what was happening and too scared to speak out.\"</p> <p>The legacy of bloodlust may be hardest to erase. Most of those who had their collars felt were just boy rowdies, out for fun. But it's the images of women and their children marching through the night that stick most in the mind: infants toting cardboard coffins, mothers chanting hate. It may have been triggered by a combination of local circumstances and national news events. But Paulsgrove still came to represent with terrible vividness a mood of fear and loathing in the national psyche.</p> <p>If the leading lights of Rap are anything to go by, that mood may rise again. Among the most vocal was Katrina Kessell, 33-year-old lone mother of five, and a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Her credentials as a mother took a knock at the height of the protests when her three-year-old son was found wandering alone while she was off venting her ire. Kessell, though, is undaunted. \"My mum was looking after him, and she's disabled. He hadn't gone very far; he was looking for the policeman he'd met the night before who'd shown him how to use a camcorder.\" She regrets the violence, but not being fined \u00a360 last Monday for, as she puts it, \"shouting me mouth off in the street\".</p> <p>She sticks by her assertion that only the undeserving got the doorstep treatment: \"We checked them all out properly, we had people down the library looking back through the newspapers.\" She says the longer-term benefits are clear. By Kessell's reckoning, all but two paedophiles now remain to pose a threat to children, and they at least, she says, are being \"properly monitored\" by the police: \"It's a lot better round here now they've gone.\"</p> <p>Moreover, she explains, seeing off the paedo-menace has yielded other improvements: the child protection sessions are part of a council drive to assuage community fears that has been careful to take grass-roots sentiment on board. Plus, she says, there's been a healthy growth of public spirit: \"A lot of us are closer than we were. Looking out for our kids has helped bring people together.\"</p> <p>Not everyone agrees, and not everyone on Paulsgrove is as content to talk to the media: for example, established residents groups have declined to cooperate with a planned Channel 4 Dispatches programme. Yet even some of those with grave misgivings about the protests believe - or, at least, hope - that some good may have come from them.</p> <p>Father Gary recalls that \"the more obvious it became that completely innocent citizens were being driven from their homes, the more people started to think about the problem of paedophiles a bit more deeply. They began to ask well, if we don't have these people here, where else will they go? Or, just because we haven't got them living in our streets, does that mean they stop being a danger to our children?\" But as Father Gary also said: \"It was a pretty frightening way to start up a debate.\"</p>",

Meanwhile, at ground level, fears have had to be stilled and scars healed. \"It could have happened anywhere,\" Father Gary says as he takes me on a tour through Paulsgrove. It's not urban unrest country. Paulsgrove does not bloom with affluence, but nor does it reek of decay. Sixty per cent of its properties are owner-occupied and early residents, called \"Grovers\", maintain a pioneering spirit. Theirs, though, was not the sort of solidarity paraded by the \"perv-hunters\". Councillor David Horne, a resident of Paulsgrove for 36 years, describes how \"the whole estate was touched by it. If they didn't see it for themselves, they saw it on the news every night. There were lots of terrified people asking each other 'are they going to come down my street next?' Most people look on the protesters with nothing but contempt. You could say the community has united against them. Most of all, they would just like to forget.\" The council remains engaged in social fabric surgery. Rob Hutchinson, director of Portsmouth social services, says: \"We've got into a closer dialogue with the community; a respectable community which is articulating itself in a way that it hasn't done before. The established local groups like the tenants associations, and more recently the protesters, have been contributing in a responsible and sensible way.\" But getting to this stage has not been easy. The problem was establishing a dialogue with the protest organisers - Residents Against Paedophiles, as they are known - with their mobile-phone networks, business cards and mob which trailed in their wake. And once the protests were called off came the long slog of reconstruction. A \"Keep Safe\" programme has been running in the schools, and last month a Paulsgrove primary hosted the launch of council-funded child protection awareness sessions. Hutchinson and others have also offered reassurance that the system designed to protect the public against paedophiles works. He stresses that following previous expressions of concern, Burnett had been the subject of two public protection conferences involving social services, probation staff and the police - the standard procedure. The conclusion of both assessments was that, despite his previous record, there was no evidence that Burnett was going back to his old ways. As for the others who attracted Rap's attentions, the authorities are certain that none posed a threat. Up to 20 people were screened by social services, the probation service and the police. Of these, some had no criminal record, no charges pending, nor even any previously recorded allegation of criminal activity. Others did have convictions, of which some were for sexual offences. But these were not against young children and, in one case, had been committed many years ago with no subsequent reoffending. In short, all the protesters' targets subsequent to Burnett were victims of rumour, gossip and, in some cases, sheer spite. Nor were those besieged and terrorised inside their homes the only victims, according to Superintendent Bob Golding who was in charge of policing: \"There are the children who witnessed the demos or took part; some of them were only four or five years old. Then there were others in the area, intimidated by what was happening and too scared to speak out.\" The legacy of bloodlust may be hardest to erase. Most of those who had their collars felt were just boy rowdies, out for fun. But it's the images of women and their children marching through the night that stick most in the mind: infants toting cardboard coffins, mothers chanting hate. It may have been triggered by a combination of local circumstances and national news events. But Paulsgrove still came to represent with terrible vividness a mood of fear and loathing in the national psyche. If the leading lights of Rap are anything to go by, that mood may rise again. Among the most vocal was Katrina Kessell, 33-year-old lone mother of five, and a victim of sexual abuse as a child. Her credentials as a mother took a knock at the height of the protests when her three-year-old son was found wandering alone while she was off venting her ire. Kessell, though, is undaunted. \"My mum was looking after him, and she's disabled. He hadn't gone very far; he was looking for the policeman he'd met the night before who'd shown him how to use a camcorder.\" She regrets the violence, but not being fined \u00a360 last Monday for, as she puts it, \"shouting me mouth off in the street\". She sticks by her assertion that only the undeserving got the doorstep treatment: \"We checked them all out properly, we had people down the library looking back through the newspapers.\" She says the longer-term benefits are clear. By Kessell's reckoning, all but two paedophiles now remain to pose a threat to children, and they at least, she says, are being \"properly monitored\" by the police: \"It's a lot better round here now they've gone.\" Moreover, she explains, seeing off the paedo-menace has yielded other improvements: the child protection sessions are part of a council drive to assuage community fears that has been careful to take grass-roots sentiment on board. Plus, she says, there's been a healthy growth of public spirit: \"A lot of us are closer than we were. Looking out for our kids has helped bring people together.\" Not everyone agrees, and not everyone on Paulsgrove is as content to talk to the media: for example, established residents groups have declined to cooperate with a planned Channel 4 Dispatches programme. Yet even some of those with grave misgivings about the protests believe - or, at least, hope - that some good may have come from them. Father Gary recalls that \"the more obvious it became that completely innocent citizens were being driven from their homes, the more people started to think about the problem of paedophiles a bit more deeply. They began to ask well, if we don't have these people here, where else will they go? Or, just because we haven't got them living in our streets, does that mean they stop being a danger to our children?\" But as Father Gary also said: \"It was a pretty frightening way to start up a debate.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence came under fire at a ceremony to reward upholders of free speech last night. The department was handed a gong \"for services to censorship\" at the inaugural Index on Censorship awards, held in London. Judges said the MoD had made it \"virtually impossible for anyone to expose malpractice within the armed or intelligence services\" by pursuing a number of prosecutions under the Official Secrets Act. A jailed Iranian editor, Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, received the award for most courageous defence of free speech. Mr Shamsolvaezin, former editor in chief of a now-banned newspaper, Neshat, was found guilty of \"hurting Islam\" and placed in solitary confinement. International whistleblower of the year was Gregory Pasko, a former officer in the Russian navy, who was jailed in November 1997 after revealing how military vessels were dumping radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan. The awards were announced at a dinner hosted by television presenter Jon Snow.",

      "bodyText": "A law intended to protect women accusers in rape trials from questioning about their sex lives is to be challenged in the House of Lords next month, as being a breach of a defendant's right to a fair trial. Section 41 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, which came into force last December, faces a challenge under the Human Rights Act before it has been applied in a trial. Three appeal court judges concluded provisionally last month that the provision would \"unfairly distort the trial process\" if a jury could not be told that the accuser, whom the defendant alleges consented to sex, had willingly had sex with him not long before. Last week they gave leave to take the case to the Lords, which will hold an expedited hearing on March 26. Other pending cases are awaiting the law lords' ruling, which could alter the provision or even hold it incompatible with the European convention on human rights, putting pressure on the government to amend it. Lawyers for the accused, who was due to stand trial the day after the act came into effect, argued that it prevented him having a fair trial. The ban was introduced after lobbying by women's groups, who said that past occasions were not relevant in deciding whether a woman consented on the occasion in question. Previous attempts to restrict questioning about sexual history were frustrated because judges were left a discretion, which they freely exercised. Section 41 removed the discretion, and laid down that, where the issue was consent, questioning would be permitted only in extremely limited circumstances. Evidence of previous sexual encounters with the accused could be given only if they happened \"at or about the same time\" as the alleged rape. The judge due to preside last December ruled that the law barred him from allowing evidence, but he gave permission \"with enthusiasm\" to take the case to the court of appeal, adding: \"The sooner this is looked at, the better. This problem is likely to arise in many, many cases before crown courts.\" No details about the case can be reported because the man is due to stand trial after the judgment. The court of appeal provisionally concluded that \"the trial process would be unfairly distorted if a jury were precluded from knowing that the complainant and the defendant had recently engaged in consensual sexual activity\". The judges confirmed that section 41 barred evidence of previous sexual encounters between the woman and the man where the issue was whether she consented or not, but was admissible where the man's defence was not that the woman consented, but that he believed she was consenting. It is a defence under English law if the man can convince the jury that he honestly believed the woman was consenting, however unreasonable the belief might seem. If he raises the defence of \"mistaken belief\", the onus is on the prosecution to disprove it. This \"Morgan defence\", named after a case in which a husband invited three men to have sex with his wife, telling them she was \"kinky\" and was likely to struggle to get \"turned on\", has been much criticised but mistaken belief in consent remains a defence. The appeal court judges said the result of the legislation was that the trial judge would have to direct the jury to take account of the evidence that the couple had a previous sexual relationship in assessing the defendant's state of mind, but to disregard it in assessing the woman's. \"It might be thought that a summing up in such terms would owe more to Lewis Carroll than to sensible jurisprudence,\" said Lord Justice Rose, who headed the panel. Martin Bowley QC, an experienced criminal barrister, described the law as a shambles. He said: \"I think Alice in Wonderland is putting it mildly.\"",

The paratroopers were given it only 11 hours before they arrived in West Africa last May, yet they were told they were going 36 hours before they left the UK. The ministry yesterday admitted responsibility for one paratrooper who contracted malaria. He was not provided with drugs until five days after he arrived in Sierra Leone. However, it rejected claims by the 14 others, who include sergeants, other non-commissioned officers, and privates. They had all received Mefloquine before departure, a spokeswoman said. \"The ministry's medical advice is that if taken within 24 hours of arrival [in malarial regions] you will be protected,\" she added. Asked to comment on this disagreement, Mr Woolf said: \"My clients were trustworthy and honest men in the eyes of the MoD ... it seems their word is no longer taken.\" He described the response to the soldiers' claims as outrageous, saying their careers had been blighted for ever. Some 200 soldiers arrived in Sierra Leone without anti-malaria tablets because of a shortage of Mefloquine. The issue was first raised last summer by the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, Paul Keetch. He was told by Geoff Hoon, defence secretary, that \"the number of cases confirmed are within medically expected numbers\". Of the personnel who served there, 112 have contracted malaria, and there are three other suspected cases. Yet between 1995 and 2000 only 47 armed forces personnel contracted malaria. The ministry had \"a duty to ensure that our armed forces are given the best protection we can afford\", Mr Keetch said. \"The MoD must be prepared to make a full and frank disclosure - this is not a matter of vital national security. A first step would be to publish the full text of the tri-service board of inquiry set up in June 2000.\"",

      "bodyText": "Legacy is under government pressure to seek new partners to develop the Millennium Dome ahead of a make-or-break meeting of ministers next week. Ministers handling the sale have made clear to Legacy that they believe the group's prospects of making a success of the Greenwich complex would be strengthened if other companies joined the bid team. The pressure on Legacy to widen its share base reflects Whitehall concern about handing the dome to the consortium dominated by Irish-based Treasury Holdings and fronted by the British property developer Robert Bourne. Doubts have been raised about Legacy's ability to sign up enough tenants to transform the dome into a hi-tech Knowledge City surrounded by pubs, restaurants, shops and houses. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, and the dome minister, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, are to decide next Monday whether to accept Legacy's offer or throw open the sale and invite fresh bids. Tony Blair is understood to have privately reassured Legacy that the government hopes to complete the deal next week after Mr Prescott admitted there were \"problems\" with the negotiations. A Legacy source said: \"If it's off, it's off next week,\" but insisted that an agreement was close and that the construction giant Sir Robert McAlpine, which declined to join the consortium last month, was now prepared to do so. Ministers, however, are keen for Legacy to sign up other partners in a move that would inevitably reduce Treasury Holding's 80% stake in the group. \"If there is a situation where the government suggests we bring in a third party, because it might be beneficial, we are not short of offers,\" said the Legacy source. \"That only works if the deal is right for everyone... it still has to be financially worth doing.\" Ministers and Legacy had set next Wednesday, St Valentine's Day, as the deadline for the deal to be struck and the government will only extend the period if the agreement is close to completion. The Legacy source admitted the consortium was \"pretty battered\" and \"battle weary\" after growing speculation that it would fail to buy the dome. Legacy director Richard Barrett, co-owner of Treasury Holdings, insisted at the weekend no \"deal breaker\" issues were outstanding though the group's spokesmen on both sides of the Irish sea yesterday sounded less optimistic than they did last week. The Tories have stepped up attacks on the proposed sale, questioning Legacy's ability to handle the project and calling for the sale to be reopened. Legacy was made \"preferred bidder\" last autumn when Nomura, the Japanese merchant bank, dropped out. The consortium is likely to seek compensation for the \u00a37m cost of the bid if it is unsuccessful. Though other potential bidders are waiting in the wings, the government is keen to sell the dome before the election to blunt Conservative attempts to make it a campaign issue.",

      "body": "<p>It was unlikely, given the conditions created on the London underground yesterday by the one-day strike, that any passenger lucky enough to get on a train had room to open a newspaper. That was probably a good thing. News of the leaked Railtrack report on the safety of the overground network and the catalogue of Railtrack's \"gross inefficiencies\" and \"negligence\" make gloomy reading for passengers crammed into carriages with oxygen levels that feel as though they compare unfavourably with Mars.</p> <p>Until last Friday, it seemed that the London underground was headed for the same chaos that privatisation has produced in the railway system. Now there is some hope that this grotesque situation might be avoided, but the game is far from over.</p> <p>Last Friday, John Prescott agreed to hand over the negotiations that will determine the future of London Underground to Ken Livingstone's appointee as transport commissioner, Bob Kiley. The agreement was hailed as a breakthrough and it is certainly a significant step towards reason from a government allergic to Livingstone and all he represents. But it remains to be seen whether Kiley can devise a scheme acceptable to the contractors, Ken Livingstone, John Prescott and, most challenging of all, a Treasury that seems wedded to the mistakes of the past. Kiley will have to accomplish this formidable task against the clock.</p> <p>Kiley's critique of the terms that the government had set for the initial private-public partnership plan was devastating. The scheme was set to follow the John Major manual on How To Privatise a Railway in all but name. It repeated the folly of separating the wheels from the track - three subterranean Railtracks would have been created; it did nothing to meet the government's aim of developing an integrated transport policy for the capital; the initial targets for service delivery were set to lower standards even further; and the structure of the contracts gave every incentive for the consortia to deliver a poor and expensive service and few levers that the transport authority could pull to ensure a cheap and efficient one.</p> <p>In his first report to Ken Livingstone on the PPP proposal, Kiley observed, with admirable self-restraint, that it seemed to be based on the idea that privatisation automatically produced efficiency because the profit motive ensured that it did. Not so, he said. It is competition, not privatisation per se that produces efficiency.</p> <p>There was, of course, no more element of competition in the PPP proposals for the London underground than there had been in the overground railway. Under the original PPP proposals, the contracts would hand over 30-year private monopolies on everything bar the actual operation of the trains and the staffing of the stations. It would have created a system under which, as Kiley put it, the profit motive dictated that contractors offer \"the least expensive product or service at the highest price\" - a prescription for private profit and public squalor.</p> <p>Having created the monster, the government would hand it over to Ken Livingstone's transport authority to run. But that authority would have to try, as the railway companies are doing today, to run trains on a system over which it had no control beyond compensatory payments for disruption to services that could be blamed on the infrastructure. Just as in the railway system, such an arrangement risked becoming a disincentive to pre-emptive maintenance, precisely because maintenance disrupts services and would trigger penalties.</p> <p>It might have been more reassuring had any party to the proposed agreement had a clear idea of what the London underground needed. But beyond the observation, available to passengers on a daily basis, that the system is in deep trouble, there was no inventory of the state of the physical structure, which should have been the starting point of any negotiations. It was, a recipe, Kiley concluded, for worse service at higher public cost.</p> <p>There were two important concessions last Friday: Kiley, who has an admirable record in salvaging New York's and Boston's underground systems, will have the opportunity to begin negotiations again. The second concession springs from the first - it is fundamental to Kiley's approach that the management of the system remain unified; in other words, that there will be no Railtrack-operator divide. The challenge will be to come up with a scheme that satisfies the Treasury's demand for PPP with a degree of management control of the private operators' activities that Kiley will want.</p> <p>That is a difficult circle to square. Even if he squares it to his own satisfaction, the prospective bidders - and the Treasury - will be hard to convince. The Treasury position appears to start from a rigid commitment to private finance and go from there to the running of the underground. Kiley, on the other hand, begins with how to achieve the best management of the underground and displays an open mind on how to fund it. As a mere passenger, I know which approach I prefer.</p> <p>In New York, Kiley largely financed the rescue of the subway system through bonds. Last week, the admirable French railway system, which is most things the British railway system is not - efficient clean, reliable, rapid and reasonably priced - went to the London bond market to raise finance for the next phase of its high speed network. Despite this offence to Treasury orthodoxy, the sun did not freeze in the heavens and Paris still seems to be standing.</p> <p>The privatisation of the British rail network took one of the most cost-efficient rail networks in the world (although one of the worst funded in Europe) and turned it into a passenger's nightmare. It created a complicated system that is perfect for passing the buck and a nightmare to run. It has cost money and lives. Compared to that, issuing bonds to finance a system that remains in public ownership with democratic accountability seems a rather lesser evil.</p> <p>Unlike his boss, Kiley is not a man with a track record of populism to whom the government could attribute political motives. He is an expert from an entrepreneurial culture of the kind that the Treasury likes, who is putting forward the modest proposition that a capital city depends on its public infrastructure and that it should be financed in the most cost-efficient way.</p> <p>Long before Kiley got involved, the companies that were interested in the London Underground PPP warned the government that the price they were willing to pay would come down sharply if Livingstone became mayor. The consortia seemed well able to put a price on the conflict between a politician who wants to win popularity by delivering a better service and their own desire to benefit from the huge contracts.</p> <p>Labour had hoped, of course, that this would be a done deal long before the election was called. There are a lot of votes to lose in the part-privatisation of the underground. We shall soon know whether Kiley can square the circle, using PPP, but there could be another - perhaps we could call it a third - way. If the benefits of PPP are so great, why not test them against a real alternative?

      "bodyText": "It was unlikely, given the conditions created on the London underground yesterday by the one-day strike, that any passenger lucky enough to get on a train had room to open a newspaper. That was probably a good thing. News of the leaked Railtrack report on the safety of the overground network and the catalogue of Railtrack's \"gross inefficiencies\" and \"negligence\" make gloomy reading for passengers crammed into carriages with oxygen levels that feel as though they compare unfavourably with Mars. Until last Friday, it seemed that the London underground was headed for the same chaos that privatisation has produced in the railway system. Now there is some hope that this grotesque situation might be avoided, but the game is far from over. Last Friday, John Prescott agreed to hand over the negotiations that will determine the future of London Underground to Ken Livingstone's appointee as transport commissioner, Bob Kiley. The agreement was hailed as a breakthrough and it is certainly a significant step towards reason from a government allergic to Livingstone and all he represents. But it remains to be seen whether Kiley can devise a scheme acceptable to the contractors, Ken Livingstone, John Prescott and, most challenging of all, a Treasury that seems wedded to the mistakes of the past. Kiley will have to accomplish this formidable task against the clock. Kiley's critique of the terms that the government had set for the initial private-public partnership plan was devastating. The scheme was set to follow the John Major manual on How To Privatise a Railway in all but name. It repeated the folly of separating the wheels from the track - three subterranean Railtracks would have been created; it did nothing to meet the government's aim of developing an integrated transport policy for the capital; the initial targets for service delivery were set to lower standards even further; and the structure of the contracts gave every incentive for the consortia to deliver a poor and expensive service and few levers that the transport authority could pull to ensure a cheap and efficient one. In his first report to Ken Livingstone on the PPP proposal, Kiley observed, with admirable self-restraint, that it seemed to be based on the idea that privatisation automatically produced efficiency because the profit motive ensured that it did. Not so, he said. It is competition, not privatisation per se that produces efficiency. There was, of course, no more element of competition in the PPP proposals for the London underground than there had been in the overground railway. Under the original PPP proposals, the contracts would hand over 30-year private monopolies on everything bar the actual operation of the trains and the staffing of the stations. It would have created a system under which, as Kiley put it, the profit motive dictated that contractors offer \"the least expensive product or service at the highest price\" - a prescription for private profit and public squalor. Having created the monster, the government would hand it over to Ken Livingstone's transport authority to run. But that authority would have to try, as the railway companies are doing today, to run trains on a system over which it had no control beyond compensatory payments for disruption to services that could be blamed on the infrastructure. Just as in the railway system, such an arrangement risked becoming a disincentive to pre-emptive maintenance, precisely because maintenance disrupts services and would trigger penalties. It might have been more reassuring had any party to the proposed agreement had a clear idea of what the London underground needed. But beyond the observation, available to passengers on a daily basis, that the system is in deep trouble, there was no inventory of the state of the physical structure, which should have been the starting point of any negotiations. It was, a recipe, Kiley concluded, for worse service at higher public cost. There were two important concessions last Friday: Kiley, who has an admirable record in salvaging New York's and Boston's underground systems, will have the opportunity to begin negotiations again. The second concession springs from the first - it is fundamental to Kiley's approach that the management of the system remain unified; in other words, that there will be no Railtrack-operator divide. The challenge will be to come up with a scheme that satisfies the Treasury's demand for PPP with a degree of management control of the private operators' activities that Kiley will want. That is a difficult circle to square. Even if he squares it to his own satisfaction, the prospective bidders - and the Treasury - will be hard to convince. The Treasury position appears to start from a rigid commitment to private finance and go from there to the running of the underground. Kiley, on the other hand, begins with how to achieve the best management of the underground and displays an open mind on how to fund it. As a mere passenger, I know which approach I prefer. In New York, Kiley largely financed the rescue of the subway system through bonds. Last week, the admirable French railway system, which is most things the British railway system is not - efficient clean, reliable, rapid and reasonably priced - went to the London bond market to raise finance for the next phase of its high speed network. Despite this offence to Treasury orthodoxy, the sun did not freeze in the heavens and Paris still seems to be standing. The privatisation of the British rail network took one of the most cost-efficient rail networks in the world (although one of the worst funded in Europe) and turned it into a passenger's nightmare. It created a complicated system that is perfect for passing the buck and a nightmare to run. It has cost money and lives. Compared to that, issuing bonds to finance a system that remains in public ownership with democratic accountability seems a rather lesser evil. Unlike his boss, Kiley is not a man with a track record of populism to whom the government could attribute political motives. He is an expert from an entrepreneurial culture of the kind that the Treasury likes, who is putting forward the modest proposition that a capital city depends on its public infrastructure and that it should be financed in the most cost-efficient way. Long before Kiley got involved, the companies that were interested in the London Underground PPP warned the government that the price they were willing to pay would come down sharply if Livingstone became mayor. The consortia seemed well able to put a price on the conflict between a politician who wants to win popularity by delivering a better service and their own desire to benefit from the huge contracts. Labour had hoped, of course, that this would be a done deal long before the election was called. There are a lot of votes to lose in the part-privatisation of the underground. We shall soon know whether Kiley can square the circle, using PPP, but there could be another - perhaps we could call it a third - way. If the benefits of PPP are so great, why not test them against a real alternative? Let Kiley devise a bid for London Underground to run itself, financed with public borrowing and let us compare it with the PPP proposals. And let the judgment be made on the basis of cost and quality of service, not on ideology. comment@theguardian.com Related articles 05.02.2001: Tube services crippled by drivers' strike 05.02.2001: Commuters face chaos on tube strike London Underground: the issue explained 04.02.2001: Legal threat to Kiley tube deal 02.02.2001: Tube boss wins privatisation victory 02.02.2001: Drivers go ahead with tube strike Useful links Aslef Transport for London The Tube Greater London Authority Department of Transport's plans for London",

      "bodyText": "Plaice your bets now - bookies William Hill are to take bets on goldfish racing on the internet. Six fish of different colours will compete in each race. They will line up at one end of a tank, behind a barrier to prevent flying starts, and then swim around the tank until one slips under a bridge at the bottom and becomes the winner. William Hill hopes to have the first of its fish stable under starter's orders by April 7, Grand National day. A spokesman, Graham Sharpe, said: \"It's not a joke. All you need is a spacious tank, a few fish and a few cameras and you're away. \"We will be using fish like the chocolate oranda with red pom-poms, the black and white lion head and the brown telescope eye. We don't want to be accused of cruelty by painting numbers on them. \"The only danger is that it might take them hours to complete the race. We will experiment with different-sized tanks and different-coloured bridges, and we will be taking advice from relevant goldfish experts. \"The goldfish won't realise there are lots of people watching them, so it won't be stressful for them.\" In the first race the contestants will all start with the same odds, 5-1; later a form guide and differing odds will be established. But goldfish have notoriously short memories, which could throw the form book out of the window. And victorious fish may get to bask in their glory in a luxury \"winner's bowl\". Press Association",

      "body": "<p>There was an unusual photo session at Labour party headquarters last week. One after another, members of the party staff lined up to have their pictures taken alongside the prime minister, all of them no doubt smiling proudly for posterity and their mothers' mantelpieces. Progress towards a general election on May 3 is proceeding almost exactly according to schedule at Millbank Tower and, as it happens, they are getting the souvenirs organised early this time round.</p> <p>The photo shoot was probably Peter Mandelson's idea. It is the sort of thing he would have planned. He would have seen it as part of the programme to psych up the party staff for the election campaign over which he was, until so recently, in almost complete control. Since the campaign team was put in place last summer, there has been a slow and steady turn of the ratchet to prepare them all for what lies ahead. Now the sense of excited expectancy has already heightened, the tempo is quickening, the number of meetings is increasing and people keep looking at their watches to convey the message that every minute matters.</p> <p>But it is also as if, isolated as they are, they haven't noticed what is going on in the world and on the front pages of the tabloid newspapers. The eerie reality is that the political turbulence within the government has apparently done little to disrupt this atmosphere. It doesn't even seem to matter much to the \"new\" Labour apparatchik that the man who was in charge of the campaign to which they are so single-mindedly committed is no longer there. It is one of the dubious, unremarked successes of Tony Blair's new model Labour party that he and his lieutenants have managed to depoliticise the party's staff.</p> <p>In the past few days, however, the gulf between an efficient party machine and a government in trouble has become only too evident. While the party has been busy preparing for an election that it looks as if it cannot lose, the parliamentary press has been engaged with a political story that could change everything.</p> <p>In all of this, Mandelson's own role is very odd. The one person who knows how individual politicians should respond to any given crisis has been shown to be supremely incompetent at handling one that involves his own career. Blair is said to have lamented this fact, saying that \"what Peter needs is a Peter\" - a comment which should rank alongside Thatcher's tribute to the late Lord Whitelaw that \"every prime minister needs a Willie\". A recognition of the problem does not provide a solution, however.</p> <p>Some of Mandelson's real friends - a notoriously limited number - have advised the former Northern Ireland Secretary to lower his profile in the wake of his resignation. He has nevertheless appeared determined to do exactly the opposite. It seems as if not a day has gone by without another newspaper claiming an exclusive insight into the man's thought processes, or boasting of a late-night phone call from abroad. All of them have offered increasingly irrelevant analyses of the motivation for a single telephone call to the home office minister, Mike O'Brien, which may or may not have taken place and about which nobody much cares any more anyway.</p> <p>It seems pitifully evident that a man whose political career was spent attempting to manipulate the newspapers is unable to resist the temptation of trying to continue to do so, despite the fact that every interview he gives, every late-night phone call he makes to yet another journalist is destined to diminish further his standing and that of the government he still purports to serve.</p> <p>And to what end? Even the man himself, even in his current state, knows that he cannot hope to be restored to the government in any circumstance. He may have a point about being forced to resign as a matter of political expediency which, untypically, did not put the career of Peter Mandelson first - but then that's politics.</p> <p>He has two further problems. He does not have a political base, either inside parliament or outside it, something which weakens his political standing the moment he is out of office, and at a personal level he is also a curiously vulnerable individual. \"There's a flaw in his character,\" one senior party figure murmured yesterday, unconsciously echoing the now infamous, anonymous description of the chancellor, Gordon Brown, as being \"psychologically flawed\".</p> <p>According to this theory, none of Mr Mandelson's current problems need have occurred if he had handled the situation better. And he need not make a difficult situation worse for the government if, as he suggested in his interview in yesterday's Guardian, he confines himself to a low-profile discussion via his lawyers with the inquiry set up into the circumstances of his resignation and the passport applications of the Hinduja brothers.</p> <p>All might then be well, but for what Mr Mandelson's resignation has brought in its wake. There are two aspects to this. One is specific and relates to the case of his troubled former ministerial colleague, Keith Vaz, whose existing difficulties were dragged into the light of closer public scrutiny by the connecting theme of his friends, the Hindujas. His financial and political affairs have since been subject to an apparently endless series of alarming allegations. The other aspect is the more insidious problem of the attachment of that nasty word \"sleaze\" to the Labour party.</p> <p>The opinion polls of the past week have demonstrated that there is still a comfortable lead for Labour, but that the perception of the party has changed. The squeaky-clean image has gone. It may well be gone for good. But it is still a problem that needs serious attention and quickly.</p> <p>This is what seems to lie behind the suggestion that Mr Vaz, the minister for Europe, has been told to justify himself - or just go. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and the prime minister's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, have both been strident in their defence of Mr Vaz in the past couple of days but that may well not have been enough.</p> <p>There was a sense at Westminster yesterday that there were too many problems here, that the financial and business complications produced by Mr Vaz amounted to a political embarrassment that was unlikely to go away and that the best thing would be if he were to resign as quickly as possible before anything worse was revealed. The suggestion that Mr Vaz was the subject of a racist vendetta or, even more improbably, the target of Euro-sceptics is not taken seriously.</p> <p>The committee on standards which is considering a report from the parliamentary commissioner, Elizabeth Filkin, on circumstances in Mr Vaz's constituency of Leicester East is due to meet today. That could provide an answer about what Mr Vaz should do next. It might also have an impact on public opinion - if not on the uncritical Labour party staff.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:julialangdon@compuserve.com\">julialangdon@compuserve.com</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,430876,00.html\">30.01.2001: Steve Bell on Labour's reaction to Mandelson's resignation</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430740,00.html\">30.01.2001: It was Alastair Campbell who led an iniquitous panic</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430828,00.html\">30.01.2001: MI6 drawn into Hinduja passport row</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430669,00.html\">30.01.2001: A Whitehall farce </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,430305,00.html\">29.01.2001: Cabinet cuts off Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430253,00.html\">29.01.2001: Brother deals new blow to Vaz</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

Natural justice at its perfidious Albion best. Old Skippy came over all Greta Garbo at the weekend, saying that all he wants is to be left alone to get on with the job. The job? What, you mean signing whatever Jack, Ali and Mr T put in front of you? Mind you, nothing wrong with a bit of a rest. Put another bar on the fire, help yourself to tea and biscuits (it's Hob-Nobs at the Home Office on Tuesdays), get out the Times crossword. You take it easy, Skippy. You're home now, son.</p> <p>There is also no news, due to a mixture of the tube strike and sheer indolence, of the fuse crisis at the Times, where person or persons unnamed have been removing fuses from various plugs and even snipping those plugs off the microwave oven. We hope to have further discussions on the matter tomorrow with managing editor George Brock, a living example to us all that it is possible to go about one's business while wearing a tank top and without any semblance of pomposity.</p> <p>A brief word of acknowledgment to two recent correspondents. To the west London estate agent who sent the \"Dear Homeowner\" letter that began \"This is NOT a circular\", you're very kind. Sincere thanks also to Adrian Steele. \"I'm sure you will agree,\" Adrian's missive begins, \"that it's the most natural thing in the world to ...\" But what can it be? A bodily function? Falling in love? Being born or dying? What, man, what? \" ... it's the most natural thing in the world to combine the prestige and status of a Platinum card with some of the lowest rates around.\" Of course, of course.

As secretary of Labour's international department, I suppose it's unfair to expect him to follow these things closely enough to know that we now want to be friends with North Korea. Still, perhaps someone might fill him in before he makes such an arse of himself again. There is no news from the kangaroo court of Hinduja whitewash man Sir Anthony \"Skippy\" Hammond, who has returned to the Home Office, where he worked for 24 years, to size up Mandy Mandelson in a fiercely independent inquiry already pre-empted by his host, the home secretary, and his accusation that Mandy lied. Natural justice at its perfidious Albion best. Old Skippy came over all Greta Garbo at the weekend, saying that all he wants is to be left alone to get on with the job. The job? What, you mean signing whatever Jack, Ali and Mr T put in front of you? Mind you, nothing wrong with a bit of a rest. Put another bar on the fire, help yourself to tea and biscuits (it's Hob-Nobs at the Home Office on Tuesdays), get out the Times crossword. You take it easy, Skippy. You're home now, son. There is also no news, due to a mixture of the tube strike and sheer indolence, of the fuse crisis at the Times, where person or persons unnamed have been removing fuses from various plugs and even snipping those plugs off the microwave oven. We hope to have further discussions on the matter tomorrow with managing editor George Brock, a living example to us all that it is possible to go about one's business while wearing a tank top and without any semblance of pomposity. A brief word of acknowledgment to two recent correspondents. To the west London estate agent who sent the \"Dear Homeowner\" letter that began \"This is NOT a circular\", you're very kind. Sincere thanks also to Adrian Steele. \"I'm sure you will agree,\" Adrian's missive begins, \"that it's the most natural thing in the world to ...\" But what can it be? A bodily function? Falling in love? Being born or dying? What, man, what? \" ... it's the most natural thing in the world to combine the prestige and status of a Platinum card with some of the lowest rates around.\" Of course, of course. Well done, MBNA Platinum Plus credit card, for that! Would the general manager of Rybridge Audi, an \"approved\" Audi dealership in Stoke-on-Trent, please contact the Diary at once. diary@theguardian.com",

Following the Alder Hey report, health secretary Alan Milburn said the new law would ensure that no organs or tissues would be removed without the informed consent of close relatives. Fair enough. But he then said there would be criminal sanctions if such informed consent was not obtained. Does he really envisage that a doctor or hospital official who doesn't provide enough detailed information will be hauled up before the courts and possibly be sent to prison? Are we going to have incessant legal arguments between a doctor in the dock saying he did sufficiently inform and the prosecution saying he didn't?

The three judges of the appeal court which decided the appeal last month were all men. The five law lords who will finally decide the issue will all be men, because there are no women in the highest court in the land.

What my questioners have in mind is, of course, the article in the European Convention on Human Rights which states: \"Every politician has the right to be treated with the utmost courtesy, respect and honesty. No politician shall be unfairly disparaged in the media or be shafted by his political colleagues. All government ministers shall have full lifetime security of tenure.\" I believe that Mr Mandelson would have a strong case under this article. Unfortunately, it does not exist. But he could try claiming that he had been subject to \"inhuman or degrading treatment\" under article 3 of the convention, or that he failed to get a \"fair hearing by an impartial tribunal\" under article 6 - a kangaroo court, sitting privately, made up of the Lord Chancellor, the permanent secretary to the Cabinet and the prime minister's chief of staff, and not hearing any evidence from the accused, is not, on the surface, a guarantee of independence.

      "body": "<p>Let's face it, doctors and lawyers have never enjoyed the most cordial of relationships, particularly in the current post-Shipman, post-Alder Hey climate of mistrust. Doctors are fond of telling the joke about a lawyer who is hoping to win a particularly gruesome medical negligence case. Clutching at straws, the lawyer cross-examines the doctor who signed the death certificate. \"Why didn't you make any attempt to revive the patient?\" The doctor explains that it had been too late. \"Aha, so then the patient might have been alive How do you know he wasn't?\" \"Well,\" replies the doctor, \"his brain was already in a jar, but I suppose the rest of him could still have gone out and practised law.\"</p> <p>Against this backdrop, it is all the more surprising to learn that the legal profession is receiving an unlikely influx of new recruits - disillusioned doctors seeking a more rewarding job. Hilary Barsey, 34, is one. She qualified as a doctor but worked for just a year before deciding to study for the CPE examinations - the conversion course for non-law graduates - and then taking the one-year solicitors' training course.</p> <p>She says, \"It wasn't that I hated being a doctor, I didn't. But London medical schools are very narrow places. I found I was spending all my time with other medics, and the actual job involved going through the same boring procedures over and over. I had always been interested in medical ethics, and I could see that the legal profession was beginning to impact on medicine to a far greater degree.\"</p> <p>Barsey now works for Field Fisher Waterhouse, a City firm where she specialises in acting for patients who are suing their doctors. \"I use my medical knowledge as a matter of routine. It's very helpful in initial case analysis. As a doctor, I have an immediate grasp of surgical procedures and areas where things can go wrong. I know if a patient is telling me details which sound out of the ordinary, and I'm also better placed to ask difficult questions when the medical specialists are brought into a case.\"</p> <p>Not all Barsey's former colleagues in the medical profession support her change of career. \"Some have commented about my joining the enemy and going off and suing doctors. If I win a big settlement for a client, there are always some doctors I know who will say 'Oh, bang goes our new incubator', but for the most part it's just light-hearted banter.\"</p> <p>To some extent, the two professions are not dissimilar. Both thrive on high levels of adrenalin and drama, surely the reason why they have provided such rich material for TV shows. But in other regards, law seems at odds with the traditional altruistic calling of the professional healer.</p> <p>Barsey sees things in common. \"I work very closely with distressed clients, not so far removed from being a doctor. There's the same satisfaction involved of having made a real difference to someone's life, too. If a family has a brain-damaged child, then it's vitally important that they get the best possible settlement - that's really going to make a difference to them, and as their solicitor I do make a considerable emo tional investment on their behalf.\"</p> <p>So what does it feel like to be on the other side of the fence; does she experience the occasional pang of guilt? \"Well I do feel a bit sorry for doctors these days. They never used to be the subject of criticism, it simply wasn't done.\"</p> <p>Like Barsey, Simon Joyston-Bechal, 37, worked as a doctor for only a year after qualifying. He now works at the big City firm Clifford Chance, where his specialist areas are pharmaceuticals and product liability. \"I loved studying medicine, but I did not enjoy working as a doctor,\" he confides. \"When I told my friends at the hospital what I was thinking of doing, none of them was the least bit surprised. Many said they might do the same thing.</p> <p>\"Those who had had a hard slog to get through medical school couldn't understand why I would want to go through all that [studying] again. But I never had a problem with the exams, the problem was with the work.</p> <p>\"I've met several ex-doctors in the law profession. It's worth pointing out that we're not people who couldn't cope with the stress of being a junior doctor and so had to run away and do something else. Rather, we're people who have had the confidence to see that there is more to life than medicine. It takes a considerable amount of independence of thought to walk away from being a doctor, it's a very defining career.\"</p> <p>He claims that he works just as hard now as he did as a doctor, although he doesn't have to be on call, but that the working environment is much better: \"Medicine is a hostile professional environment; everyone has to make such an effort being nice to the patients that they tend to take their aggression out on their colleagues.\"</p> <p>However, he does concede that a medical training can be ideal for becoming a lawyer. \"Many of the skills required are the same, such as dealing with distressed people, and also absorbing large amounts of complex information. Medicine gives a good grounding for court; if you've gone on ward rounds with the professor picking apart your words in front of everyone, then you can survive going to trial. When winning or losing a case hangs in the balance, that's stressful, but if you've faced life-and- death situations every day then it puts things into perspective.\"</p> <p>For some, the move to law is more empowering than battling with the vagaries of human illness. Ranald Davidson trained as a doctor in Edinburgh and worked as a doctor for a short time before deciding to become a barrister. Now 32, he specialises in medical negligence cases at 3 Serjeants' Inn in London.</p> <p>\"I think part of the excitement about law is that it's adversarial, there really is an element of you against them,\" he says. \"You're pitting your wits against an opponent, which gives a tremendous adrenalin rush. With medicine the adversary is not another barrister or another team, but nature, which is like fighting against fate.</p> <p>\"From the moment you leave medical school you're on a conveyor belt. I realised that I was going to be very unhappy doing the job for the rest of my life so I decided to get out while I was still young enough to take a risk. Now I look at former colleagues who might be tempted to do what I've done, but now they've got children and mortgages the decision will be more difficult.\"</p> <p>Some might assume that his move to the Bar was motivated by money, but Davidson laughs at this. \"There is this illusion that barristers make fortunes. The reality is that I had to start from scratch and work my way up the ladder again - I've only just about caught up with my colleagues in the medical profession. Obviously longer-term there is money to be made, but consultants who take on private patients can make just as much.\"</p> <p>Not all those doctors becoming lawyers are necessarily using their previous backgrounds as a specialism. Patrick Beale, 34, works in the commercial disputes division of Richards Butler. Shortly after qualifying in London, he decided he had had enough. \"Something more commercial had always interested me. In the NHS I felt that I wasn't valued by anyone and I didn't like changing jobs every six months during training. You don't get to build up a rapport with a team. So I chose law, but I didn't want to be be pigeonholed by immediately going into medical law.\"</p> <p>He finds he still uses his medical training, even in the world of corporate litigation. \"You're often dealing with people who find themselves in very stressful situations - if a company director loses a case, for example, it could mean people's jobs are on the line. In medicine I was always very conscious of having to give explanations in lay terms, demystify the jargon. That's also certainly true of being a lawyer.\"</p> <p>Beale says he hasn't noticed much shift in his public status since making the job change. \"Being a lawyer used to have certain connotations, but you only really notice that when you go to America.\"</p> <p>Is being a lawyer easier than being a junior doctor?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't say so. Sometimes I might be in the office from eight in the morning till 10 at night, but at least I go back to my own home and my own bed as opposed to sleeping in hospital.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Let's face it, doctors and lawyers have never enjoyed the most cordial of relationships, particularly in the current post-Shipman, post-Alder Hey climate of mistrust. Doctors are fond of telling the joke about a lawyer who is hoping to win a particularly gruesome medical negligence case. Clutching at straws, the lawyer cross-examines the doctor who signed the death certificate. \"Why didn't you make any attempt to revive the patient?\" The doctor explains that it had been too late. \"Aha, so then the patient might have been alive How do you know he wasn't?\" \"Well,\" replies the doctor, \"his brain was already in a jar, but I suppose the rest of him could still have gone out and practised law.\" Against this backdrop, it is all the more surprising to learn that the legal profession is receiving an unlikely influx of new recruits - disillusioned doctors seeking a more rewarding job. Hilary Barsey, 34, is one. She qualified as a doctor but worked for just a year before deciding to study for the CPE examinations - the conversion course for non-law graduates - and then taking the one-year solicitors' training course. She says, \"It wasn't that I hated being a doctor, I didn't. But London medical schools are very narrow places. I found I was spending all my time with other medics, and the actual job involved going through the same boring procedures over and over. I had always been interested in medical ethics, and I could see that the legal profession was beginning to impact on medicine to a far greater degree.\" Barsey now works for Field Fisher Waterhouse, a City firm where she specialises in acting for patients who are suing their doctors. \"I use my medical knowledge as a matter of routine. It's very helpful in initial case analysis. As a doctor, I have an immediate grasp of surgical procedures and areas where things can go wrong. I know if a patient is telling me details which sound out of the ordinary, and I'm also better placed to ask difficult questions when the medical specialists are brought into a case.\" Not all Barsey's former colleagues in the medical profession support her change of career. \"Some have commented about my joining the enemy and going off and suing doctors. If I win a big settlement for a client, there are always some doctors I know who will say 'Oh, bang goes our new incubator', but for the most part it's just light-hearted banter.\" To some extent, the two professions are not dissimilar. Both thrive on high levels of adrenalin and drama, surely the reason why they have provided such rich material for TV shows. But in other regards, law seems at odds with the traditional altruistic calling of the professional healer. Barsey sees things in common. \"I work very closely with distressed clients, not so far removed from being a doctor. There's the same satisfaction involved of having made a real difference to someone's life, too. If a family has a brain-damaged child, then it's vitally important that they get the best possible settlement - that's really going to make a difference to them, and as their solicitor I do make a considerable emo tional investment on their behalf.\" So what does it feel like to be on the other side of the fence; does she experience the occasional pang of guilt? \"Well I do feel a bit sorry for doctors these days. They never used to be the subject of criticism, it simply wasn't done.\" Like Barsey, Simon Joyston-Bechal, 37, worked as a doctor for only a year after qualifying. He now works at the big City firm Clifford Chance, where his specialist areas are pharmaceuticals and product liability. \"I loved studying medicine, but I did not enjoy working as a doctor,\" he confides. \"When I told my friends at the hospital what I was thinking of doing, none of them was the least bit surprised. Many said they might do the same thing. \"Those who had had a hard slog to get through medical school couldn't understand why I would want to go through all that [studying] again. But I never had a problem with the exams, the problem was with the work. \"I've met several ex-doctors in the law profession. It's worth pointing out that we're not people who couldn't cope with the stress of being a junior doctor and so had to run away and do something else. Rather, we're people who have had the confidence to see that there is more to life than medicine. It takes a considerable amount of independence of thought to walk away from being a doctor, it's a very defining career.\" He claims that he works just as hard now as he did as a doctor, although he doesn't have to be on call, but that the working environment is much better: \"Medicine is a hostile professional environment; everyone has to make such an effort being nice to the patients that they tend to take their aggression out on their colleagues.\" However, he does concede that a medical training can be ideal for becoming a lawyer. \"Many of the skills required are the same, such as dealing with distressed people, and also absorbing large amounts of complex information. Medicine gives a good grounding for court; if you've gone on ward rounds with the professor picking apart your words in front of everyone, then you can survive going to trial. When winning or losing a case hangs in the balance, that's stressful, but if you've faced life-and- death situations every day then it puts things into perspective.\" For some, the move to law is more empowering than battling with the vagaries of human illness. Ranald Davidson trained as a doctor in Edinburgh and worked as a doctor for a short time before deciding to become a barrister. Now 32, he specialises in medical negligence cases at 3 Serjeants' Inn in London. \"I think part of the excitement about law is that it's adversarial, there really is an element of you against them,\" he says. \"You're pitting your wits against an opponent, which gives a tremendous adrenalin rush. With medicine the adversary is not another barrister or another team, but nature, which is like fighting against fate. \"From the moment you leave medical school you're on a conveyor belt. I realised that I was going to be very unhappy doing the job for the rest of my life so I decided to get out while I was still young enough to take a risk. Now I look at former colleagues who might be tempted to do what I've done, but now they've got children and mortgages the decision will be more difficult.\" Some might assume that his move to the Bar was motivated by money, but Davidson laughs at this. \"There is this illusion that barristers make fortunes. The reality is that I had to start from scratch and work my way up the ladder again - I've only just about caught up with my colleagues in the medical profession. Obviously longer-term there is money to be made, but consultants who take on private patients can make just as much.\" Not all those doctors becoming lawyers are necessarily using their previous backgrounds as a specialism. Patrick Beale, 34, works in the commercial disputes division of Richards Butler. Shortly after qualifying in London, he decided he had had enough. \"Something more commercial had always interested me. In the NHS I felt that I wasn't valued by anyone and I didn't like changing jobs every six months during training. You don't get to build up a rapport with a team. So I chose law, but I didn't want to be be pigeonholed by immediately going into medical law.\" He finds he still uses his medical training, even in the world of corporate litigation. \"You're often dealing with people who find themselves in very stressful situations - if a company director loses a case, for example, it could mean people's jobs are on the line. In medicine I was always very conscious of having to give explanations in lay terms, demystify the jargon. That's also certainly true of being a lawyer.\" Beale says he hasn't noticed much shift in his public status since making the job change. \"Being a lawyer used to have certain connotations, but you only really notice that when you go to America.\" Is being a lawyer easier than being a junior doctor? \"I wouldn't say so. Sometimes I might be in the office from eight in the morning till 10 at night, but at least I go back to my own home and my own bed as opposed to sleeping in hospital.\"",

      "body": "<p>The European commission, attacked the government yesterday, questioning its commitment to open up the postal sector to competition and abolish the Post Office's monopoly. </p> <p>Frits Bolkestein, the EU commissioner for the internal market, in a speech in London, claimed that the government said one thing in public but did the opposite when it came to negotiating behind closed doors. </p> <p>The EC wants the Post Office and its European counterparts to lose their monopoly in 2003 on the delivery of all letters weighing more than 50 grams. </p> <p>It has run into opposition from the European parliament and countries such as Britain which favour a more gradual liberalisation. </p> <p>Mr Bolkestein, increasingly frustrated at the pace of progress, yesterday cited a recent newspaper interview in which Gordon Brown stated that postal services were an area where the EU should \"keep up pressure for reform\". </p> <p>\"But, when the commission's proposal for what amounted to not more than a partial opening of the postal markets was discussed in the council of ministers recently, the UK offered little support,\" the Dutchman told an audience at Mansion House last night. \"It was a disappointment to me not to find the UK taking the commission's side.\" </p> <p>In a warning to the government not to go its own way on the issue when Graham Corbett, chairman of the UK Postal Services Commission, delivers his recommendations for reform this summer, Mr Bolkestein demanded EU-wide rules for the sector. </p> <p>\"I am aware of the importance the UK government attaches to the views of Mr Corbett, who is due to report shortly on the issue of liberalisation of postal services. I am interested in what Mr Corbett has to say but there cannot be one rule for the UK and another for the rest of the EU.\" </p> <p>In private, EU officials claim that Tony Blair is reluctant to act on the matter before the general election for fear of alienating the postal unions. The unions say that the EC's proposals would result in up to 50,000 job losses while the Post Office has warned that it would lose \u00a3400m a year in revenues and would no longer be able to provide a nationwide service. </p> <p>A spokesman last night argued that the government was still committed to liberalisation but \"it has to take into account the different circumstances in different countries\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European commission, attacked the government yesterday, questioning its commitment to open up the postal sector to competition and abolish the Post Office's monopoly. Frits Bolkestein, the EU commissioner for the internal market, in a speech in London, claimed that the government said one thing in public but did the opposite when it came to negotiating behind closed doors. The EC wants the Post Office and its European counterparts to lose their monopoly in 2003 on the delivery of all letters weighing more than 50 grams. It has run into opposition from the European parliament and countries such as Britain which favour a more gradual liberalisation. Mr Bolkestein, increasingly frustrated at the pace of progress, yesterday cited a recent newspaper interview in which Gordon Brown stated that postal services were an area where the EU should \"keep up pressure for reform\". \"But, when the commission's proposal for what amounted to not more than a partial opening of the postal markets was discussed in the council of ministers recently, the UK offered little support,\" the Dutchman told an audience at Mansion House last night. \"It was a disappointment to me not to find the UK taking the commission's side.\" In a warning to the government not to go its own way on the issue when Graham Corbett, chairman of the UK Postal Services Commission, delivers his recommendations for reform this summer, Mr Bolkestein demanded EU-wide rules for the sector. \"I am aware of the importance the UK government attaches to the views of Mr Corbett, who is due to report shortly on the issue of liberalisation of postal services. I am interested in what Mr Corbett has to say but there cannot be one rule for the UK and another for the rest of the EU.\" In private, EU officials claim that Tony Blair is reluctant to act on the matter before the general election for fear of alienating the postal unions. The unions say that the EC's proposals would result in up to 50,000 job losses while the Post Office has warned that it would lose \u00a3400m a year in revenues and would no longer be able to provide a nationwide service. A spokesman last night argued that the government was still committed to liberalisation but \"it has to take into account the different circumstances in different countries\".",

      "bodyText": "Harland &amp; Wolff put its 500 staff on a three-day week yesterday as work dried up and the Belfast shipbuilder said it lost \u00a326m last year. The yard is waiting for the Ministry of Defence to give a start date for building two roll-on, roll-off ships but the company's main shareholder, Fred Olsen Energy, warned that delays would mean further job cuts. The bulk of the \u00a326m deficit came from redundancy payments to 1,000 of the 1,500 staff who have been forced to leave the yard, which built the liner Titanic. Fred Olsen said it had pumped in \u00a390m over the past few years and believed it was time for Harland to become self-sufficient. The Oslo-based group said the Belfast yard's future should be secured by the British government's decision in October to build two of a six-ship fleet in Northern Ireland. Harland is preparing to go to the Court of Appeal in London in its fight with an American company over a drilling ship contract. Global Marine refused to pay the final \u00a323m instalment for the second vessel claiming it was not finished on time or to order last summer. A Harland spokesman said it was still chasing other work opportunities and this summer it will seek planning permission to create a \u00a3400m science and leisure park on a third of the land it leases and will redevelop it over 10 years under the Titanic Quarter banner.",

      "body": "<p>Coherence is not the most important thing if you do something that is really wide,\" says Lars Nittve, the director of Tate Modern. He's talking about Century City, Tate Modern's huge new exhibition about creativity in the 20th-century metropolis - a tour of nine world cities at key artistic moments, the museum's first loan exhibition. \"I think that, when you do something that is seemingly coherent, you cover up different possibilities and different voices and different perspectives. I think we were quite keen on keeping curatorial voices visible. I almost have a dream that someone will sit down and actually study, maybe as an academic study, the different curatorial approaches that you find in Century City.\" </p> <p>Perhaps one day, but first there are the reviews. Century City has attracted some stinkers. It has been described as an \"appalling start to Tate Modern's exhibition programme\" and \"a joyless stew\". The reviews are consistent in what they damn. This is the difference between the sniping Nittve feels is inevitable when an institution has been as successful as Tate Modern, and a really mistaken show. The exhibition does not establish a consistent argument; what does come through is a bizarre mixture of the patronising - unconvincing visits to Lagos and Bombay - and the complacent, with London in the 1990s given pride of place in the Turbine Hall. Other criticisms? The selection of times and places makes no historical sense: for example, New York is represented by conceptual art from the early 1970s, when the city's eminence as art capital stretches from Pollock to Warhol and beyond. It's about fashion rather than curiosity. And the admission price is a shock at \u00a38.50. </p> <p>Tate Modern has delighted its enemies and disappointed its friends with this show, which stretches from Paris in the age of cubism to London in the age of Gary Hume, and implies they are really quite similar. How was this monster created? </p> <p>When it came to the museum's first exhibition, the Tate team wanted a curatorial carnival, a state-of-the-art exercise in interpretation. As Nittve explains, it's not simply that the nine sections of Century City have been organised by a curator each. \"Then there were the team curators who oversaw three cities each from a Tate perspective. Then above that, Iwona Blazwick oversaw the whole process, and then I oversaw even more.\" There were seminars to share ideas, but the cities were treated separately and in different styles. You begin to see what went wrong. </p> <p>Century City takes the same revisionist approach to 20th-century art as Tate Modern's opening displays, with their rejection of \"isms\" - but this time with more curators and fewer ideas. \"We wanted to do something that continued the discussion about curatorial practices that had started with how we install the collection,\" Nittve explains. The surveys of visitors conducted by Tate Modern have found that around a third are critical of the thematically arranged displays. Nittve believes these people come with a prior understanding of what they think is modern art. People who don't have any assumptions don't mind if Richard Long is next to Monet. He has a Rousseau-esque idea of the perfectly open-minded Tate Modern visitor, and it's this untutored savage that Century City targets. </p> <p>But doesn't the success of Tate Modern change the nature of its responsibility? The vast visitor figures - expected to hit 5m by the end of the first year - mean that the radical curating by which Nittve sets such store is irrelevant to many people. We might like a rigorous story of modern art, one in which Picasso's Paris is related to our own time historically. </p> <p>Nittve believes the modern art museum \"is about memory and history, and representing history, and at the same time it's an arena for contemporary discourse, for contemporary art. That tension between having a Picasso retrospective and at the same time showing contemporary artists gives the museum its energy. Of course, you also put contemporary artists at risk by comparison with the classics.\" The danger, as Century City illustrates, is that you simplify the past without helping the present. </p> <p>Tate Modern's forthcoming attractions include a survey of the Italian 1960s movement Arte Povera, a surrealism show, and a Matisse/Picasso exhibition curated by John Golding, the eminent historian of modernism. All of these sound like substantial shows worthy of this great museum. Century City deserves to be just a blip. </p> <p>\u0095 Century City is at Tate Modern, London SE1 (020-7887 8008), until April 29.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Cliches abound about the photographer Brassa\u00ef. He found his profession while wandering through Paris after dark. He sucked the streets into his camera, then rushed home with his haul before dawn. He was a creature of the night . . . There's a marvellous snapshot of Brassa\u00ef as a society photographer for a costume ball in the early 1930s. His gaze meets and confounds yours, his dress suit black and white, his shirt overstarched. He looks as if he has stumbled out of a German expressionist film, a sinister dark lord with dark brows and dark rings around his eyes. </p> <p>And what could be more cliched than Brassa\u00ef's stock in trade: photographs of Paris in black and white? We all know Robert Doisneau's Ur-romantic Le Baiser de l'Htel de Ville - he a tousled-haired Tom Waits, she a Celia Johnston with her right arm dangling passively, the gooseberry in beret approaching behind them. Paris is too iconic, too pretty for us to see it afresh in black and white. And we know a little about Henri Cartier-Bresson and his \"decisive moment\". The photographer must wait and wait until the right moment. And then he must pounce. </p> <p>So the problem when we look at Brassa\u00ef's photographs of Paris in the early 1930s is to really see them. But an exhibition of 250 of his photos (as well as sculptures and drawings) at London's Hayward Gallery will soon give us another chance - and Brassa\u00ef is worth the effort. </p> <p>Occasionally Brassa\u00ef seems to have found that photographic holy grail, the decisive moment. His Lovers in a Small Cafe, Near the Place d'Italie (1932) seems just that, a pendant to Doisneau's kissing couple. Here the lovers seated in a booth are poised to embrace. Her head is tilted back, the fingers of her right hand fanned in parallel to her face. Her painted smile, her painted nails are perfect. She is a study in abandon. And what of him? He is pressing her to the back of the booth and we see his hair, slicked back. The photographer has pounced and the moment has been seized. </p> <p>But this is no decisive moment captured from the flow of reality. The image is too constructed for that. Behind the woman's simulacrum of an ardent face is a reflection of the man's approaching head, the lips cut off, so that we see lazily calculating eyes descending on their quarry. We see what she sees. The romance dissolves in his sleepy predator's advance. Behind them too is a reflection of the woman's profile, which tells another story of what she is feeling. There are other reflections that make us realise that the photographer has sliced up reality and pasted it together in a much more interesting way. </p> <p>After looking closely at this photograph, it's no surprise to learn that Brassa\u00ef would stage-manage his images. Elsewhere, the flower seller's customer was a friend of his, as was at least one of the lovers on a bench. In the sequence at a brothel called Suzy's, the prostitutes look so natural that their client must be real. But no: the client was a stand-in (apparently for legal reasons, but there were also aesthetic imperatives). So, are Kiki, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Treize and Lilly really dozing prostitutes, with their rhyming eyebrows and Clara Bow lips, or were they stand-ins? It's hard to be certain. Still less, ultimately, to care. </p> <p>Brassa\u00ef (1899-1984) was born in Hungary and arrived in France in 1924. His home town was called Brasso, hence the name Brassa\u00ef (his original name was Gyula Halesz). At first he worked as a journalist, then he took up photography so that he could sell German newspapers both the text and pictures. But the photography, as well as being more lucrative, became more interesting. He wanted \"to capture the beauty of the streets and gardens in the rain and fog and to capture Paris by night\". </p> <p>He didn't have much enthusiasm for snatching pictures. He preferred composing his im ages, and then retreating to the studio where he would do a great deal of his creative work. \"A negative means nothing for my kind of photographer,\" he wrote. \"It's the artist's print that counts.\" </p> <p>Unlike his contemporaries, the Englishman Tony Ray-Jones or the American Lee Friedlander, Brassa\u00ef never wanted to become what they called a \"pickpocket\" photographer, nimbly stealing people's images. He couldn't be like them, because he used cumbersome equipment that required lengthy exposure. He used a tripod and a magnesium flash, which were hardly inconspicuous. </p> <p>One can understand why he didn't want to be a pickpocket photographer. One day in 1944 he leaned out of his window to take a picture of the troops come to liberate Paris. He was mistaken for a sniper and a few bullets whistled over his head. </p> <p>And he had a higher calling. \"The meaning of art is not authenticity, but the expression of authenticity,\" wrote Brassa\u00ef. He also cited Baudelaire, that wanderer of city streets, who, though suspicious of photography, would have seen Brassa\u00ef as a painter of modern life \"drawing out the eternal from the ordinary\". Indeed, Brassa\u00ef located himself in a line that started with Rembrandt (\"The ancestor of all us reporters of life\") and Goya (\"He, too, loves the street with its crowded life\") before reaching the Paris of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec. </p> <p>What eternity can we see in the quotidian that Brassa\u00ef photographs? In The Baker (1930-32), Brassa\u00ef has photographed a bare-backed baker through the shadows of a barred window. He holds a pole so he can shove the dough into the oven. The light comes from offstage, as does the heat that we can almost feel from the unseen oven. In Paris, there could be nothing more eternal or nocturnal than the baking of bread. </p> <p>But nothing quite prepares you for Brassa\u00ef on the prowl at night. He's so sinister! Very little of his work would find its way on to a chocolate box. That said, my calendar of Parisian photographic scenes does include two by Brassa\u00ef. January is the Eiffel Tower shot from the Trocadero in 1931. One huge wrought iron gate is closed, the other open, and through the latter we see the tower with its neon stars. It is too pretty to have much more than documentary value. </p> <p>For the sinister Brassa\u00ef, you should look at his picture of Notre Dame at night as seen from the Isle Saint-Louis. Nobody had really photographed Paris after dark until then; looking at this picture, we sense that he has the city to himself. There isn't a soul in the picture. But beyond that uncanniness is the puffed-up bulk of the cathedral's flying buttresses, huge and upsetting in the dark. </p> <p>Or consider another soulless photograph, this time of the Luxembourg Gardens. The gates are locked, so Brassa\u00ef shoots through them to the virgin snow and the frightening branches of an avenue of trees. At the end of that dark avenue is a tiny but intense burst of light from the palace. There's an extraordinary mood of menace here - a whole code of horror movies in a single image. </p> <p>The surrealists loved Brassa\u00ef. They liked his foggy shots of Paris, particularly his silhouetted statue of Marshall Ney, sword aloft against a sea of fog and neon, particularly. But Brassa\u00ef, while producing a lot of work for their reviews and getting a nice poem written about him by Jacques Pr\u00e9vert, didn't dig their philosophy: \"I never sought to express anything but reality itself, than which there is nothing more surreal.\" </p> <p>In his drawings and sculptures of the 1940s and 1950s he was expressionist. Almost too much so: here his work seems derivative, his drawings borrowing from prevailing trends, his sculptures owing too much to his friend Picasso. His photographs of his art chums are chiefly of historical interest. They aren't the best of Brassa\u00ef. For that, let's go back to his Paris of the early 1930s. A magnesium flash of light reaches up the scaffolding around the Tour Saint-Jacques, a spectral stump with underlit gargoyles flying off into the dark. Brassa\u00ef is on the prowl once more.

      "bodyText": "Cliches abound about the photographer Brassa\u00ef. He found his profession while wandering through Paris after dark. He sucked the streets into his camera, then rushed home with his haul before dawn. He was a creature of the night . . . There's a marvellous snapshot of Brassa\u00ef as a society photographer for a costume ball in the early 1930s. His gaze meets and confounds yours, his dress suit black and white, his shirt overstarched. He looks as if he has stumbled out of a German expressionist film, a sinister dark lord with dark brows and dark rings around his eyes. And what could be more cliched than Brassa\u00ef's stock in trade: photographs of Paris in black and white? We all know Robert Doisneau's Ur-romantic Le Baiser de l'Htel de Ville - he a tousled-haired Tom Waits, she a Celia Johnston with her right arm dangling passively, the gooseberry in beret approaching behind them. Paris is too iconic, too pretty for us to see it afresh in black and white. And we know a little about Henri Cartier-Bresson and his \"decisive moment\". The photographer must wait and wait until the right moment. And then he must pounce. So the problem when we look at Brassa\u00ef's photographs of Paris in the early 1930s is to really see them. But an exhibition of 250 of his photos (as well as sculptures and drawings) at London's Hayward Gallery will soon give us another chance - and Brassa\u00ef is worth the effort. Occasionally Brassa\u00ef seems to have found that photographic holy grail, the decisive moment. His Lovers in a Small Cafe, Near the Place d'Italie (1932) seems just that, a pendant to Doisneau's kissing couple. Here the lovers seated in a booth are poised to embrace. Her head is tilted back, the fingers of her right hand fanned in parallel to her face. Her painted smile, her painted nails are perfect. She is a study in abandon. And what of him? He is pressing her to the back of the booth and we see his hair, slicked back. The photographer has pounced and the moment has been seized. But this is no decisive moment captured from the flow of reality. The image is too constructed for that. Behind the woman's simulacrum of an ardent face is a reflection of the man's approaching head, the lips cut off, so that we see lazily calculating eyes descending on their quarry. We see what she sees. The romance dissolves in his sleepy predator's advance. Behind them too is a reflection of the woman's profile, which tells another story of what she is feeling. There are other reflections that make us realise that the photographer has sliced up reality and pasted it together in a much more interesting way. After looking closely at this photograph, it's no surprise to learn that Brassa\u00ef would stage-manage his images. Elsewhere, the flower seller's customer was a friend of his, as was at least one of the lovers on a bench. In the sequence at a brothel called Suzy's, the prostitutes look so natural that their client must be real. But no: the client was a stand-in (apparently for legal reasons, but there were also aesthetic imperatives). So, are Kiki, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Treize and Lilly really dozing prostitutes, with their rhyming eyebrows and Clara Bow lips, or were they stand-ins? It's hard to be certain. Still less, ultimately, to care. Brassa\u00ef (1899-1984) was born in Hungary and arrived in France in 1924.

      "body": "<p>In a courtroom in the town of Kaluga, south-west of Moscow, later this month, a Russian academic and security affairs specialist will stand trial for espionage. Igor Sutyagin, 35, who collates and analyses information from Russian newspapers and periodicals for the prestigious US-Canada Institute in Moscow, is accused of passing state secrets to the old cold war enemy.</p> <p>Human rights activists denounce the case as the latest evidence of the \"spy-mania\" gripping Russia under President Vladimir Putin, and point to a series of alarming signals suggesting that the secret police are clawing back power and influence after a decade of disgrace and demoralisation.</p> <p>\"There's a new fear. It's a new situation,\" a former KGB general now in banking said. \"There's a sense of the KGB's return. For 10 years those guys were sitting around silent. Now they see their chance.\"</p> <p>Under Mr Putin, who served in the KGB for 16 years, former KGB officers and military men are playing a bigger role in politics than at any time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Sergei Ivanov, a career KGB officer, heads Mr Putin's security council and is increasingly seen as the unofficial and unelected vice-president. A former KGB colleague, Viktor Ivanov, runs the Kremlin personnel department. Nikolai Patrushev, another former colleague of Mr Putin's and head of the KGB's main successor, the FSB, has just been put in charge of the war in Chechnya.</p> <p>\"It's unprecedented that the army and the interior ministry troops are put under the secret police. That's a new direction for Russia,\" Sergei Grigoryants, a leading human rights activist and head of the Glasnost Foundation, said.</p> <p><b> Outsiders</b><br> Of 18 new regional governors elected in the 13 months since Mr Putin became president, four are army or navy officers. Of the seven presidential envoys Mr Putin has appointed to run \"super-regions\", five are army or ex-KGB officers.</p> <p>\"They're incompetent,\" the ex-KGB general said. \"They don't know economics, they can't pay salaries, and they're outsiders in the regions they're supposed to be running.\"</p> <p>Last week the liberals' leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, said that Mr Putin was building a police state. The former prime minister and fellow liberal Yegor Gaidar told a conference in Washington that the jury was still out on whether Mr Putin's government was committed to democracy. He noted \"a very serious increase of the role of the secret service\", and \"selective pressure\" on the free media. \"All this shows that the Russian leadership at least is not very decided on the issue of democracy being necessary.\"</p> <p>The Sutyagin case follows the sentencing in December of Edmund Pope, a retired US naval officer, to 20 years for spying. Mr Pope was the first American to be sentenced for espionage in Russia for 40 years, though Mr Putin promptly displayed magnanimity and pardoned him.</p> <p><b> Pollution</b><br> That case was preceded by the high-profile trials of environmentalists and ex-military whistleblowers charged with treason for publicising nuclear pollution in Russia's far north and far east. The point, critics say, is to intimidate the independent-minded and discourage opposition.</p> <p>For example, Mr Sutyagin's employer, the US-Canada Institute, is highly influential with the Moscow foreign policy elite, while being seen as liberal and pro-western.</p> <p>\"The effect of putting Sutyagin on trial is to create a climate of fear,\" said Valery Borshev, who runs the human rights section of the parliamentary legislation committee. \"Yet again, the hunt is on for enemies of the state.\"</p> <p>The arrests and trials have prompted a tug-of-war between the security services on the one hand, and civil organisations and the media. Human rights groups have just held the biggest ever conference of its type in Moscow in response to the encroachment on civil liberties. That the conference took place at all is a measure of how Russia's fledgling civil society is developing, indicating resistance to the Kremlin and suggesting that Mr Putin's authoritarian instincts are less than total.</p> <p>But for the past year reports have been circulating in Moscow that the president is bent on restoring the all-powerful KGB under a new name, and making it answerable to himself. It is thought, however, that he wants it to exercise a selective control, recognising that he cannot restore the sweeping surveillance of the Soviet era.</p> <p>After the abortive KGB-led putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, President Boris Yeltsin set about destroying the KGB. He dissolved its huge bureaucracy and broke down its 16 directorates into five separate agencies, to prevent power being concentrated.</p> <p>Many of the most able secret policemen left to make money in the new private sector or to run the burgeoning private armies and security services of the big banks and companies. The FSB went through eight chiefs in as many years.</p> <p>But Mr Putin has ended that disarray and rehabilitated the KGB as the embodiment of the ascetic, incorruptible public service. The Kremlin spin doctors have been assiduously cultivating the image of the secret policeman as modern hero.</p> <p>In December secret policemen spent the evening carousing with Mr Putin, not at their Lubyanka headquarters in Moscow but in the Kremlin, to celebrate the foundation in December 1917 of the Cheka, the Bolshevik forerunner of the KGB which developed into the key instrument of the Great Terror.</p> <p>\"The history of the Lubyanka in the last century is our history,\" Mr Patrushev declared. \"We should retain and increase everything in that history which worked for the benefit of Russia.\"</p> <p>Such remarks chill democrats.

      "bodyText": "In a courtroom in the town of Kaluga, south-west of Moscow, later this month, a Russian academic and security affairs specialist will stand trial for espionage. Igor Sutyagin, 35, who collates and analyses information from Russian newspapers and periodicals for the prestigious US-Canada Institute in Moscow, is accused of passing state secrets to the old cold war enemy. Human rights activists denounce the case as the latest evidence of the \"spy-mania\" gripping Russia under President Vladimir Putin, and point to a series of alarming signals suggesting that the secret police are clawing back power and influence after a decade of disgrace and demoralisation. \"There's a new fear. It's a new situation,\" a former KGB general now in banking said. \"There's a sense of the KGB's return. For 10 years those guys were sitting around silent. Now they see their chance.\" Under Mr Putin, who served in the KGB for 16 years, former KGB officers and military men are playing a bigger role in politics than at any time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Sergei Ivanov, a career KGB officer, heads Mr Putin's security council and is increasingly seen as the unofficial and unelected vice-president. A former KGB colleague, Viktor Ivanov, runs the Kremlin personnel department. Nikolai Patrushev, another former colleague of Mr Putin's and head of the KGB's main successor, the FSB, has just been put in charge of the war in Chechnya. \"It's unprecedented that the army and the interior ministry troops are put under the secret police. That's a new direction for Russia,\" Sergei Grigoryants, a leading human rights activist and head of the Glasnost Foundation, said. Outsiders Of 18 new regional governors elected in the 13 months since Mr Putin became president, four are army or navy officers. Of the seven presidential envoys Mr Putin has appointed to run \"super-regions\", five are army or ex-KGB officers. \"They're incompetent,\" the ex-KGB general said. \"They don't know economics, they can't pay salaries, and they're outsiders in the regions they're supposed to be running.\" Last week the liberals' leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, said that Mr Putin was building a police state. The former prime minister and fellow liberal Yegor Gaidar told a conference in Washington that the jury was still out on whether Mr Putin's government was committed to democracy. He noted \"a very serious increase of the role of the secret service\", and \"selective pressure\" on the free media. \"All this shows that the Russian leadership at least is not very decided on the issue of democracy being necessary.\" The Sutyagin case follows the sentencing in December of Edmund Pope, a retired US naval officer, to 20 years for spying. Mr Pope was the first American to be sentenced for espionage in Russia for 40 years, though Mr Putin promptly displayed magnanimity and pardoned him. Pollution That case was preceded by the high-profile trials of environmentalists and ex-military whistleblowers charged with treason for publicising nuclear pollution in Russia's far north and far east. The point, critics say, is to intimidate the independent-minded and discourage opposition. For example, Mr Sutyagin's employer, the US-Canada Institute, is highly influential with the Moscow foreign policy elite, while being seen as liberal and pro-western. \"The effect of putting Sutyagin on trial is to create a climate of fear,\" said Valery Borshev, who runs the human rights section of the parliamentary legislation committee. \"Yet again, the hunt is on for enemies of the state.\" The arrests and trials have prompted a tug-of-war between the security services on the one hand, and civil organisations and the media. Human rights groups have just held the biggest ever conference of its type in Moscow in response to the encroachment on civil liberties. That the conference took place at all is a measure of how Russia's fledgling civil society is developing, indicating resistance to the Kremlin and suggesting that Mr Putin's authoritarian instincts are less than total. But for the past year reports have been circulating in Moscow that the president is bent on restoring the all-powerful KGB under a new name, and making it answerable to himself. It is thought, however, that he wants it to exercise a selective control, recognising that he cannot restore the sweeping surveillance of the Soviet era. After the abortive KGB-led putsch against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, President Boris Yeltsin set about destroying the KGB. He dissolved its huge bureaucracy and broke down its 16 directorates into five separate agencies, to prevent power being concentrated. Many of the most able secret policemen left to make money in the new private sector or to run the burgeoning private armies and security services of the big banks and companies. The FSB went through eight chiefs in as many years. But Mr Putin has ended that disarray and rehabilitated the KGB as the embodiment of the ascetic, incorruptible public service. The Kremlin spin doctors have been assiduously cultivating the image of the secret policeman as modern hero. In December secret policemen spent the evening carousing with Mr Putin, not at their Lubyanka headquarters in Moscow but in the Kremlin, to celebrate the foundation in December 1917 of the Cheka, the Bolshevik forerunner of the KGB which developed into the key instrument of the Great Terror. \"The history of the Lubyanka in the last century is our history,\" Mr Patrushev declared. \"We should retain and increase everything in that history which worked for the benefit of Russia.\" Such remarks chill democrats. Mr Borshev said that during the Yeltsin years he, and various non-governmental organisations, had a dialogue with the Kremlin and were consulted by the security council. \"That's all gone now,\" he said. \"They don't want contact with public bodies. It's closed analysis, closed decisions and closed actions. There's no information and no control. The problem is that the public is now receptive - it is looking to the secret police to solve its problems - while the FSB takes that as a licence to renew the old KGB methods.\" Mr Grigoryants said a Russian diplomat had told him that the FSB had installed a \"telephone trust-line\" at the foreign ministry for staff to denounce colleagues. \"They're promised anonymity.\" Ministry staff had been told to meet foreigners only in pairs, one to keep an eye on the other. Mr Grigoryants was at a meeting in Brussels with European officials and lobbyists last month to plan a Paris conference. Out of courtesy, he said, he had informed the Russian embassy about the meeting. \"Two Russian diplomats showed up. They were very unconstructive and tried to disrupt the meeting.\" In an rare interview with a Moscow newspaper in December, Sergei Lebedev, the foreign intelligence chief, waxed sentimental about spies and secret police. \"Being an agent means being reliable,\" he said. \"It means dedication to the homeland, to comrades, it means being noble.\"",

      "bodyText": "Three million London commuters faced a rain-sodden struggle to and from work yesterday as the most effective strike on the London Underground for a decade rammed home the seriousness of the continuing conflict over the future of the tube. The chaos was not only confined to the south: transport was disrupted and tens of thousands of homes were left in freezing darkness as blizzards caused havoc in the north of England and Scotland. In London the walkout by more than 2,000 members of the train drivers' union Aslef, called over fears about safety under the government's plans to part-privatise the underground, all but shut down the network, leaving fewer than 10% of trains running. With only 40 out of the usual 476 trains in service, the disruption sharply increased traffic congestion and overcrowding on bus and rail services, with City of London police calling in extra officers to patrol bus queues after scuffles broke out between stranded passengers. London Underground, which was accused of provoking the strike by the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, agreed to meet both main rail unions this morning at the conciliation service Acas in an attempt to avoid the next two stoppages, planned for Monday and Monday week. Yesterday's strike went ahead despite last Friday's agreement by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, to give Mr Livingstone's transport commissioner, Bob Kiley, a free hand to draw up \"modifications\" to the government's partial selloff plans to avoid the fragmentation of the tube. The unions have welcomed the move, but all sides concede that there is still no agreed compromise formula and Aslef and the Rail Maritime and Transport union - whose own strike vote was overturned by the High Court last week - are determined to secure safety guarantees from tube managers. Mr Livingstone laid the blame for yesterday's disruption at the door of \"senior London Underground management\", who he said had provoked the strike and \"been consistently unconvincing about safety on the tube, both to myself and the trade unions\". Mick Rix, general secretary of Aslef, which represents around three-quarters of tube drivers, said the union regretted the inconvenience. \"But this is a dispute about safety and we believe most commuters realise that a small inconvenience today is far better than a big accident tomorrow.\" Steve Norris, Transport for London board member, described the strike as a \"cynical waste of time\", and said it had nothing to do with safety and a lot to do with job preservation. Another board member, Susan Kramer, said: \"I'm really sad that the mayor has not had big enough shoulders to accept that he has supported the trade unions to strike and blaming it on London Underground management. \"I do not think that anyone in the real world is convinced that this will make the government more sensitive to the misery of travel in London.\" The weather was the cause of further misery in the north as around 20 inches of snow blanketed Northumberland, cutting power supplies and forcing schools to turn children away.

British officials believe that the plan would end any idea among asylum seekers that Britain is a soft touch, an accusation made forcefully by the Conservatives. A Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed last night that the idea would be on the agenda for the Anglo-French summit in Cahors on Friday. \"This will be one of about half a dozen ideas on the agenda,\" the spokeswoman said. \"They will look at issues which effect ports in both countries.\"</p> <p>The Tories are likely to seize on the Anglo-French scheme as a sign of panic in Downing Street over asylum, an issue which William Hague has exploited over the past year. Downing Street will be hoping that introducing such a tough measure will take the heat out of the asylum issue ahead of the election.</p> <p>British officials have drawn up the deportation scheme because of fears that the EU's Dublin convention on asylum, which Britain implemented in 1997, has failed to curb illegal immigrants. Under the convention, asylum seekers can be returned to the country which first cleared them to enter the EU. Asylum seekers who cross the channel usually enter the EU from countries such as Italy which have borders with non-EU states. This makes deportation more difficult.</p> <p>The French have yet to respond to the British proposal. However, Mr Blair will tell Mr Chirac that the scheme would benefit France by discouraging migrants entering France en route to Britain.</p> <p>The disclosure of the British plan comes amid cross-channel tensions. It is understood that Britain was irritated last month when officials learnt through the media that the French authorities were reducing border security at smaller channel ports such as Dieppe. There are reports that so called \"people-smuggling gangs\" are using smaller ports to avoid tighter controls in larger ports such as Calais.</p> <p>The prime minister underlined his determination over the weekend to stem the flow of illegal entrants when he outlined plans with the Italian prime minister Guiliano Amato to block the \"Sarajevo route\" from the Balkans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of asylum seekers could be forced back across the channel to France under a radical scheme with Paris to curb the flow of illegal immigrants to Britain. In a sign of pre-election jitters over asylum, Tony Blair will discuss the idea of summary deportations with the French president Jacques Chirac at an Anglo-French summit on Friday. The initiative follows an Anglo-Italian scheme, launched over the weekend by the prime minister and his Italian counterpart, to crack down on up to 50,000 illegal immigrants through Bosnia and the western Balkans into Europe. Mr Blair is now hoping to persuade M Chirac to sign up to a \"bilateral repatriation\" accord which would see illegal cross-channel immigrants being deported back to France immediately. British officials believe that the plan would end any idea among asylum seekers that Britain is a soft touch, an accusation made forcefully by the Conservatives. A Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed last night that the idea would be on the agenda for the Anglo-French summit in Cahors on Friday. \"This will be one of about half a dozen ideas on the agenda,\" the spokeswoman said. \"They will look at issues which effect ports in both countries.\" The Tories are likely to seize on the Anglo-French scheme as a sign of panic in Downing Street over asylum, an issue which William Hague has exploited over the past year. Downing Street will be hoping that introducing such a tough measure will take the heat out of the asylum issue ahead of the election. British officials have drawn up the deportation scheme because of fears that the EU's Dublin convention on asylum, which Britain implemented in 1997, has failed to curb illegal immigrants. Under the convention, asylum seekers can be returned to the country which first cleared them to enter the EU. Asylum seekers who cross the channel usually enter the EU from countries such as Italy which have borders with non-EU states. This makes deportation more difficult. The French have yet to respond to the British proposal. However, Mr Blair will tell Mr Chirac that the scheme would benefit France by discouraging migrants entering France en route to Britain. The disclosure of the British plan comes amid cross-channel tensions. It is understood that Britain was irritated last month when officials learnt through the media that the French authorities were reducing border security at smaller channel ports such as Dieppe. There are reports that so called \"people-smuggling gangs\" are using smaller ports to avoid tighter controls in larger ports such as Calais. The prime minister underlined his determination over the weekend to stem the flow of illegal entrants when he outlined plans with the Italian prime minister Guiliano Amato to block the \"Sarajevo route\" from the Balkans.",

The fox - nicknamed Basil - sparked a 15-minute alert during which eight security guards and policemen gave chase across three floors after spotting him early yesterday morning. He was finally cornered in the peers' wing of the Houses of Parliament, sitting on a cabinet next to a division bell, the bell used to summon MPs to vote, in third floor offices where the official Hansard records of parliamentary business are kept. The police officers named him Basil after a two-hour stand-off during which the urban fox refused to get down from the cabinet. When RSPCA officers arrived they released Basil back on to the street, unhurt after his brush with the law. A police spokesman said that Basil had delayed the morning testing of the division bell but had not otherwise disrupted parliamentary business. \"Foxes are sometimes seen in the courtyards because of the closeness of Victoria Gardens, but this is the first occasion one has been seen on the premises,\" said the police spokesman. \"It is a bit of a debate as to how Basil got in without being spotted, but he was taken away before most of the peers arrived.\" It is thought Basil is the same fox that has been seen near the parliament on several other occasions, including the morning of January 17, when MPs voted to ban hunting with dogs. Basil's latest appearance yesterday could not have been better timed for anti-hunt campaigners who are preparing to lobby peers over the hunting bill. The bill completes its committee stage this week and will receive a third reading in the Commons later this month before being voted on by the Lords.

Let's hope it reverses all these trends before some of these common birds become virtually extinct.\" The report said the most worrying aspect was that eight species had declined in monitoring sites by more than 25% in the last five years. They are grey partridge, lesser spotted woodpecker, tree pipit, yellow wagtail, willow tit, starling, tree sparrow. Other \"common\" birds in heavy decline are spotted flycatcher, pied wagtail, song thrush, mistle thrush and bullfinch. Increasing species collared dove, buzzard, mute swan, sparrowhawk, mallard and tufted duck.",

Despite concerns about attacks on children, like the killing of Anna Climbie by her aunt and the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne, such events are rarer than in many other industrialised countries. But the authors of the first league table of children's deaths by injury in the world's 26 richest countries said that, in some cases, the success of reducing numbers being killed in road accidents, drownings, fires, falls and deliberate injury, might be bought at a price. On the whole children were no longer being allowed to explore their boundaries and develop their own sense of risk and danger, said the report. The authors, a Florence-based research centre for Unicef, examined the deaths of children aged one to 14. This revealed that the UK's injury death record, 6.1 per 100,000 children in the age group each year, was better than in any other country except Sweden. The figure is a quarter of that in Korea and less than half that in the United States.

Britain's death rate from intentional injury of 0.8 per 100,000, compared with 2.74 in the US, and 1.58 in France. In most industrialised nations \"parents are increasingly worried about the threats to children, whether from traffic accidents or predatory paedophiles,\" said the report. \"In response to high profile media treatment of selected cases, and more generalised warning from public organisations that have to compete for public attention and public funds, it is natural for parents to increase the level of protection.\" It added: \"In practice this has meant that millions of parents now drive or accompany their children on journeys, prevent them from playing outside or exploring independently, and feel that every activity has to be supervised.\" The report referred to one study in the UK which suggested the proportion of children aged seven and eight who travelled to school without adult supervision fell from 80% to 10% between 1970 and 1990.

Nuala O'Loan's current powers of retrospective inquiry cover only 12 months, but legislation coming into effect next month extends this to 24 months and gives her authority where there is new evidence or serious public interest. The killing of Mr Finucane, who had represented several leading republicans and was shot dead in front of his family in their north Belfast home in 1989, would be an obvious choice for her to investigate. His wife, Geraldine, and nationalist and republican campaigners, who want a full, independent inquiry into the murder, are convinced that army intelligence and RUC special branch knew loyalist gunmen were targeting the high-profile lawyer. The Ulster Defence Association terrorist Brian Nelson, an agent for the military's force research unit, was jailed for conspiracy to murder him in 1992, and the RUC informer William Stobie, also a UDA member, has been charged in connection with the killing. The case is political dynamite because of claims that the security forces deflected paramilitaries involved in the Finucane murder from killing a top IRA member who was the army double agent known as \"Steak Knife\", leading them to kill innocent Catholics instead. Mrs O'Loan said:\"I will be reflecting on which cases to look at, but the Finucane murder is a matter of concern.\" The ombudsman's office would probably spend some months reviewing existing information and talking to a police inquiry team, headed by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, which is looking at allegations of widespread security force collusion with loyalist terrorists in the 1980s and 1990s. But Mrs O'Loan's investigators could then interrogate RUC officers and seize weapons, documents, vehicles and other relevant material. If this uncovered evidence of wrongdoing she could recommend prosecutions. Mrs O'Loan is already involved in aspects of the inquiries into the murders of the Lurgan human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson, blown up by a loyalist car bomb in 1999, and the Portadown Catholic Robert Hamill, kicked to death by a loyalist mob in 1997. Although these happened before her allotted 12-month time span, she has inherited the police inquiry into claims that RUC officers sat by in a Land Rover a few yards from where Mr Hamill was attacked, and she is examining allegations that RUC officers had threatened Mrs Nelson. Mrs O'Loan is adamant that her office, which has received 950 complaints against the RUC in 11 weeks, is politically impartial and fully independent from police and government interference. The origins of the complaints have not yet been analysed, but they are believed to have come from Protestants and Catholics throughout the province, and range from issues such as rudeness to serious physical assault. Her 33 investigators, recruited from 500 applicants worldwide, hail from as far afield as Australia, Hong Kong and the US, and include lawyers, customs and excise officials and former police. Taking responsibility for complaints out of police hands is unprecedented in the UK, and Mrs O'Loan insists the new system can work to the benefit of both police and public. \"We don't have an agenda against the police,\" she said. \"Our work is totally factual and can help prove officers innocent as well as guilty.

Overall, though, the logo does feel rather undistinguished. </p> <p><b> Rupert Howell, chief executive of Chime Communications</b> </p> <p>Firstly, I do think it's slightly strange to have a separate official logo and then an unofficial motif. I actually think the red rose is a pretty good logo for them, so it's ever so slightly weird to want to add to that.

Parachuting out of the spiralling plane that is the Labour party, perhaps. But I'm not sure that's the image they're going for. It's one of those things that when you read how they got to it, or how they post-rationalised it, it's jolly sensible. But it's not a great design. If they'd come to me I would have certainly tried to see if there was a way of doing a variation of the rose without weakening the main logo itself. But it does classically look like it has been designed by a committee with certain objectives - like voting - in mind. It's not ghastly, it's not dreadful, it's just pretty uninspiring. I've seen worse, but I've sure as hell seen better. </p> <p><b> Dan Bobby, senior consultant at brand consultancy Wolff Olins</b> </p> <p>My first reaction was that this is inappropriate. Not because of the way the logo looks, it's just that this approach seems all wrong at the moment. At a time when Labour is experiencing such great difficulties this logo just doesn't seem significant. It doesn't resonate. As symbols go, the red rose seems like a pretty good one to me. People like it and they know what it means. This feels like it should be for an NGO. I don't know where they're coming from with that, and I suspect not many other people will either. </p> <p><b> John Mathers, managing director of Fitch</b> </p> <p>It's an interesting and bold design move but I'm just not sure everyone is going to get it. I got sent a copy of the logo on fax. It came in on its side and in black and white and it looked the mathematical symbol for greater than and less than three [&gt; &lt; 3]. So I think somebody should have looked a bit more closely at in black and white before they developed the colour version. I can see what they're trying to do but unfortunately the papers at the moment are full of Labour's woes in other directions with Mandelson and Vaz, so I hope this isn't similar to the British Airways relaunch of an identity at the same time the cabin crew go on strike. </p> <p><b> Michael Peters, chairman of Identica</b> </p> <p>It only serves to demonstrate why the Labour party is in such turmoil. It's a joke. It's so reminiscent of so many other things. I'm all for change but why do something that is so derivative of other people. It's got so many different shapes and ideas in it. At the end of the day I think an identity should stand on its own, which this doesn't. It's an indication that people at the communications end of the Labour party are not thinking clearly enough because it's too complicated. And I think that if they're trying to unite people the worst thing to do is have two logos. It makes Labour seem like it's in two minds. I think if one is trying to extend a hand to existing supporters or new supporters of the Labour party they should at least come up with something which is new and innovative and dynamic and futuristic. But the way this has been crafted it looks just like one of a million things. I would have designed a rose with a knot in its stalk - as a way of saying \"don't forget us\". </p> <p><b> Chris Powell, chairman of BMP, New Labour's former ad agency </b> </p> <p>It's not really a logo because it's not replacing the rose. It's just trying to distinguish their merchandise from one year from the next. But I think whatever it's trying to imply is all in the mind of the person who designed it. I don't think anyone else can perceive those things. I'm constantly amazed by designers who think that the people see designs and read them as if they've got subtitles on. You'd know what it was if someone told you, but you don't naturally see it as a heart or a cross. Only if I see the explanation underneath do I see what it's meant to be. </p> <p><b> Michael Wolff, partner at brand consultancy The Fourth Room and creator of Labour's red rose</b> </p> <p>It's a brutish-looking logo and that is exactly why Labour get criticised as a triumph for style over substance. I know that being English we immediately look for bad things to say about everything, and I wish I could say this is a joy of a design but it's not. It falls into a category where things need to be given an explanation for why they're there because it isn't self-evident. There's a heart there, and a \"V\" shape and something that looks quite like a fried egg. But people will probably see this as a running man, and they're not going to look at the explanation underneath and and see it as an individual voting with their head and their heart. </p> <p>Labour is one of the strongest brands around at the moment and you have to ask yourself do they need a second logo as well as the rose? To sign Labour off with something that isn't the rose implies that you're changing something about Labour. But nothing has really changed within the party to warrant a different logo. The rose is real. When we designed it it had some sort of generosity of spirit. Everybody knew what it was. You give somebody a rose because you care for them. It had something both brave and ordinary about it. Whereas this comes from the land of graphic design and has no recognisable meaning. Especially if they're keeping the rose as well. To have two symbols is ridiculous. They should just have refreshed the rose and the typeface instead.</p>",

I think if one is trying to extend a hand to existing supporters or new supporters of the Labour party they should at least come up with something which is new and innovative and dynamic and futuristic. But the way this has been crafted it looks just like one of a million things. I would have designed a rose with a knot in its stalk - as a way of saying \"don't forget us\". Chris Powell, chairman of BMP, New Labour's former ad agency It's not really a logo because it's not replacing the rose. It's just trying to distinguish their merchandise from one year from the next. But I think whatever it's trying to imply is all in the mind of the person who designed it. I don't think anyone else can perceive those things. I'm constantly amazed by designers who think that the people see designs and read them as if they've got subtitles on. You'd know what it was if someone told you, but you don't naturally see it as a heart or a cross. Only if I see the explanation underneath do I see what it's meant to be. Michael Wolff, partner at brand consultancy The Fourth Room and creator of Labour's red rose It's a brutish-looking logo and that is exactly why Labour get criticised as a triumph for style over substance. I know that being English we immediately look for bad things to say about everything, and I wish I could say this is a joy of a design but it's not. It falls into a category where things need to be given an explanation for why they're there because it isn't self-evident. There's a heart there, and a \"V\" shape and something that looks quite like a fried egg. But people will probably see this as a running man, and they're not going to look at the explanation underneath and and see it as an individual voting with their head and their heart. Labour is one of the strongest brands around at the moment and you have to ask yourself do they need a second logo as well as the rose? To sign Labour off with something that isn't the rose implies that you're changing something about Labour. But nothing has really changed within the party to warrant a different logo. The rose is real. When we designed it it had some sort of generosity of spirit. Everybody knew what it was. You give somebody a rose because you care for them. It had something both brave and ordinary about it. Whereas this comes from the land of graphic design and has no recognisable meaning. Especially if they're keeping the rose as well. To have two symbols is ridiculous. They should just have refreshed the rose and the typeface instead.",

The spotlight fell on Schlumberger after reports that it has been lining up a $3bn loan ahead of a formal cash bid. Sema, whose main areas of expertise are telecoms and financial services, has been moving into Schlumberger's central energy and utility sectors. The American group would have no financial problems digesting its prey - it is around nine times larger than Sema by market capitalisation and has been profiting from higher oil prices. Schlumberger reported a 61% rise in income from continuing operations in 2000 of $735m compared with the previous year. Yesterday it declined to comment on the Sema announcement - a spokeswoman said: \"It is not our policy to comment on rumours. If there is something to say we will issue a press release.\" Finlay Thomson, an analyst at WestLB Panmure, sees Schlumberger as a likely first mover but believes a bidding war is almost inevitable. \"If the troubled LHS business within Sema is ditched, the rest of the group looks very cheap. Rivals within the sector are aware of this,\" he said. The LHS mobile phone billing firm of America, bought for $3.3bn last summer, had an adverse impact on Sema's previously strong telecoms division. By November, Sema was forced into a profit warning that triggered a 44% slump in the share price. LHS's founder and a Sema non-executive, Hartmut Lademacher, was forced out after the disclosure that he sold \u00a324m worth of Sema shares days before the warning. The financial services authority is investigating. A second profit warning followed in January and even a decision by the chief executive, Pierre Bonelli, to step down failed to halt a further 12% slide in the share price. After weeks of rumours about takeover talks, Sema yesterday formally stated: \"The board confirms that it has received preliminary approaches from certain parties which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company. Shareholders will be kept informed of any relevant developments.\" Analysts thought a firm deal was the best investors could hope for - Sema had sown the seeds of its own demise through its failure to rapidly integrate LHS and poor communications with the City.",

According to Alan Siegel: \"In 1955, O Winston Link was in Taunton, Virginia. This was the beginning of his love affair with the steam engines of the Norfolk and Western Railways. Using patches of brilliant artificial light, Link evokes a sense of the supernatural in his night-time images, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.\"</p> <p>Link's discovery of what he called the \"magic and mystery of the train at night\" led to an obsession. By 1960, he had taken nearly 2,500 shots of steam passenger and freight trains. His was already the pursuit of a myth, for the great American railway age was giving way to those of the aeroplane and automobile. As if in recognition of this, his most famous single image not focused on a train, dated 1956, is entitled Hot Shot East Bound At Lager, West Virginia. At an outdoor drive-in cinema, couples smooch in their convertibles before a screen on to which a jet fighter has been subsequently burned in. In the background is the real personalised hero of the action - the trail from a steam train, illuminated like summertime clouds against the black sky.

In other respects, his affairs of the heart were less successful. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1948. In 1984, after a long period of ill health, he married Conchita Mendoza. A decade later she was indicted for grand larceny after the disappearance of more than 1,400 of Link's prints, and for forcible imprisonment following his incarceration in their basement.

      "body": "<p>When Fred Lawton was appointed to the high court bench in 1961, he was one of the few leading QCs who stood out against the largely featureless and grey landscape that was the judiciary in those days. Unlike most appointed to the bench, he had pursued a practice at the bar that had included a substantial amount of crime.</p> <p>Fred probably knew more about the underworld than any of his brethren, since he had grown up in the shadow of the prisons in which - his father had served as the first prison officer ever to be promoted to the governor grade. The Krays, Richardson and Bertie Smalls - he had seen their like before. He was perhaps one of the first judges to have grown up in a world which was not refracted through social privilege. He was certainly the first to visit a mental hospital housing mentally disordered offenders.</p> <p>When in the 1960s the academic discipline of criminology began to expand in Britain, Fred was among the first judges not only to support it, but by his active participation in seminars to give it a wider legitimacy from which many in the profession of the law drew back. Although he presented a conservative face to the world, he did energetic work on the Criminal Law Revision Committee, and when it came to judging human behaviour, he was both radical and visionary in understanding that for the criminal law to remain a vibrant source of justice it must be ever subject to reform and innovation.</p> <p>There were those who remembered Fred having had a youthful dalliance with fascism, though he was not alone among the brightest of his generation in having been seduced, however briefly, by Mosley. When Dering, the Auschwitz camp doctor, sued Leon Uris, the author of Exodus, for libel, some in Israel doubted the propriety of his trying the case. They need not have worried: Dering emerged a pathetic and Pyrrhic victor.</p> <p>In 1958, Fred went on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists to South Africa to observe the opening of the so-called treason trial at Pretoria. At this first sight of apartheid he had been utterly sickened and became its passionate opponent ever after.</p> <p>Fred was not a man to be trifled with: when a noisy group of Welsh nationalist demonstrators attempted to break up the court during the libel action brought by the captain of Convoy PQ17 against a historian - they had apparently no idea what the case was about - by the end of the afternoon they found themselves in Brixton prison serving three months (later reduced on appeal) for contempt. In 1968, when the London School of Economics was occupied by students, and he heard that their cause was apparently championed by academics including teachers of law, Fred suggested that, like a farm infected with foot and mouth disease, it ought to be closed down for a while before being \"restocked\".</p> <p>But perhaps above all, he was a lawyer passionate for justice and concerned that miscarriages of it should be remedied. In 1953, Iain Hay Gordon (aged 19) was charged with murder of a judge's daughter in Belfast and found \"guilty but insane\" - a verdict against which there was then no appeal. Fred travelled to Belfast in 1959 to make representations to the Stormont administration on his behalf, and the following year Gordon was paroled. It was his delight in the last weeks of his life to know that not only had Gordon's case been referred to the Northern Ireland court of appeal, but that after almost 50 years a gross injustice had at last been righted.</p> <p>Though age wearied Fred's body, and cruelly, his wisdom never ceased to flourish. He saw no merit in the mandatory life sentence for murder; nor did he accept the propriety of a \"whole life\" tariff imposed by a home secretary.</p> <p>For all that he could be at times severe, his was a warm and generous nature. Drafts sent to him came back marked with the constructive erudition of a caring tutor. He always encouraged, not least by the fact that his mind was always at the cutting edge of change. By comparison with 1961, when he became a judge, the higher judiciary now rightly deserves respect for its quality and intellectual integrity. It is hard not to believe that it was men like Fred Lawton who helped bring this about.</p>",

When in the 1960s the academic discipline of criminology began to expand in Britain, Fred was among the first judges not only to support it, but by his active participation in seminars to give it a wider legitimacy from which many in the profession of the law drew back. Although he presented a conservative face to the world, he did energetic work on the Criminal Law Revision Committee, and when it came to judging human behaviour, he was both radical and visionary in understanding that for the criminal law to remain a vibrant source of justice it must be ever subject to reform and innovation. There were those who remembered Fred having had a youthful dalliance with fascism, though he was not alone among the brightest of his generation in having been seduced, however briefly, by Mosley. When Dering, the Auschwitz camp doctor, sued Leon Uris, the author of Exodus, for libel, some in Israel doubted the propriety of his trying the case. They need not have worried: Dering emerged a pathetic and Pyrrhic victor. In 1958, Fred went on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists to South Africa to observe the opening of the so-called treason trial at Pretoria. At this first sight of apartheid he had been utterly sickened and became its passionate opponent ever after. Fred was not a man to be trifled with: when a noisy group of Welsh nationalist demonstrators attempted to break up the court during the libel action brought by the captain of Convoy PQ17 against a historian - they had apparently no idea what the case was about - by the end of the afternoon they found themselves in Brixton prison serving three months (later reduced on appeal) for contempt. In 1968, when the London School of Economics was occupied by students, and he heard that their cause was apparently championed by academics including teachers of law, Fred suggested that, like a farm infected with foot and mouth disease, it ought to be closed down for a while before being \"restocked\". But perhaps above all, he was a lawyer passionate for justice and concerned that miscarriages of it should be remedied. In 1953, Iain Hay Gordon (aged 19) was charged with murder of a judge's daughter in Belfast and found \"guilty but insane\" - a verdict against which there was then no appeal. Fred travelled to Belfast in 1959 to make representations to the Stormont administration on his behalf, and the following year Gordon was paroled. It was his delight in the last weeks of his life to know that not only had Gordon's case been referred to the Northern Ireland court of appeal, but that after almost 50 years a gross injustice had at last been righted. Though age wearied Fred's body, and cruelly, his wisdom never ceased to flourish. He saw no merit in the mandatory life sentence for murder; nor did he accept the propriety of a \"whole life\" tariff imposed by a home secretary. For all that he could be at times severe, his was a warm and generous nature. Drafts sent to him came back marked with the constructive erudition of a caring tutor. He always encouraged, not least by the fact that his mind was always at the cutting edge of change. By comparison with 1961, when he became a judge, the higher judiciary now rightly deserves respect for its quality and intellectual integrity. It is hard not to believe that it was men like Fred Lawton who helped bring this about.",

      "body": "<p>A British hospital worker was last night facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia after he appeared on television in Riyadh and admitted planting a car bomb which killed a fellow Briton in November last year.</p> <p>Alexander \"Sandy\" Mitchell, a former soldier employed as an anaesthetics technician at King Fahd hospital, Riyadh, made the dramatic confession in a stage-managed television appearance on Sunday evening. Looking pale and reading haltingly from a script, Mr Mitchell, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, claimed to have planted a bomb under a car owned by Christopher Rodway. Mr Rodway, 47, was killed and four others, including his wife, were injured in the blast last year.</p> <p>Human rights groups condemned the parading on television of Mr Mitchell and two other men, a Belgian and a Canadian who also claimed to have been involved, and questioned the methods by which the confessions had been reached. A friend of Mr Mitchell's said he looked like was under the influence of drugs.</p> <p>William Sampson, a Canadian, also confessed to involvement in the explosion, and Raaf Skivens, a Belgian, claimed he had planted a second device which injured six people five days later.</p> <p>British consular officials in Riyadh were last night seeking clarification of Mr Mitchell's situation. He is understood not to have been charged with any offence, though he was originally arrested on December 17 last year in connection with an inquiry into alcohol smuggling. The consulate was not told and only became aware of the arrest when Mr Mitchell's wife, thought to be Thai, visited on January 6 to enquire after her husband.</p> <p>A British consular official visited Mr Mitchell on January 28 and according to a Foreign Office spokesman \"he seemed well\". Mr Mitchell also requested that no details of his background or circumstances be released.</p> <p>Consular officials received no forewarning of the television appearance and for some time were denied consular access to Mr Mitchell and four other Britons arrested at the end of last year as part of the alcohol inquiry. Kelvin Hawkins and his son-in-law David Marin from Greenock, Paul Moss of Merseyside, Ken Hartley and Ron Yates from Bolton are all being held in the kingdom.</p> <p>Amnesty International condemned the display and accused Saudi Arabia of widespread human rights abuses. \"We are always suspicious of any confession obtained by the Saudi Arabian justice system, which routinely uses trickery, torture and deception to obtain them,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>\"It is disturbing to see these men paraded on TV in this fashion. Reading a statement is no substitute for a proper trial. In most cases in Saudi Arabia you are unlikely even to get a proper lawyer.\"</p> <p>Stephen Jakobi, director of campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said the accused men had lost all chance of a fair trial.</p> <p>\"From experience we know the Saudis regularly abuse prisoners, torturing them or 'relay interrogating' them for 12 to 14 hours at a time, day after day until they don't know which way is up, and then saying 'sign this'.</p> <p>\"There may be some approximation of truth in these statements, but the trial is already over.

      "bodyText": "A British hospital worker was last night facing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia after he appeared on television in Riyadh and admitted planting a car bomb which killed a fellow Briton in November last year. Alexander \"Sandy\" Mitchell, a former soldier employed as an anaesthetics technician at King Fahd hospital, Riyadh, made the dramatic confession in a stage-managed television appearance on Sunday evening. Looking pale and reading haltingly from a script, Mr Mitchell, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, claimed to have planted a bomb under a car owned by Christopher Rodway. Mr Rodway, 47, was killed and four others, including his wife, were injured in the blast last year. Human rights groups condemned the parading on television of Mr Mitchell and two other men, a Belgian and a Canadian who also claimed to have been involved, and questioned the methods by which the confessions had been reached. A friend of Mr Mitchell's said he looked like was under the influence of drugs. William Sampson, a Canadian, also confessed to involvement in the explosion, and Raaf Skivens, a Belgian, claimed he had planted a second device which injured six people five days later. British consular officials in Riyadh were last night seeking clarification of Mr Mitchell's situation. He is understood not to have been charged with any offence, though he was originally arrested on December 17 last year in connection with an inquiry into alcohol smuggling. The consulate was not told and only became aware of the arrest when Mr Mitchell's wife, thought to be Thai, visited on January 6 to enquire after her husband. A British consular official visited Mr Mitchell on January 28 and according to a Foreign Office spokesman \"he seemed well\". Mr Mitchell also requested that no details of his background or circumstances be released. Consular officials received no forewarning of the television appearance and for some time were denied consular access to Mr Mitchell and four other Britons arrested at the end of last year as part of the alcohol inquiry. Kelvin Hawkins and his son-in-law David Marin from Greenock, Paul Moss of Merseyside, Ken Hartley and Ron Yates from Bolton are all being held in the kingdom. Amnesty International condemned the display and accused Saudi Arabia of widespread human rights abuses. \"We are always suspicious of any confession obtained by the Saudi Arabian justice system, which routinely uses trickery, torture and deception to obtain them,\" said a spokesman. \"It is disturbing to see these men paraded on TV in this fashion. Reading a statement is no substitute for a proper trial. In most cases in Saudi Arabia you are unlikely even to get a proper lawyer.\" Stephen Jakobi, director of campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said the accused men had lost all chance of a fair trial. \"From experience we know the Saudis regularly abuse prisoners, torturing them or 'relay interrogating' them for 12 to 14 hours at a time, day after day until they don't know which way is up, and then saying 'sign this'. \"There may be some approximation of truth in these statements, but the trial is already over. Whatever happens from now on is simply going through the motions - all the rules of fair trial have been broken and what we have to do now is hope that nothing awful happens.\" Mr Jakobi said he hoped the incident would spark a concerted campaign by the international community against summary justice in the kingdom, and said he would be petitioning the European parliament to make representations against Saudi Arabia. The extraordinary TV appearance follows a spate of bombings against westerners in Saudi Arabia since November last year. In addition to the two explosions the men claimed responsibility for, there were further explosions at a Euromarche supermarket in Riyadh and an the eastern city of Al Khobar in December. Forbidden Alcohol is strictly forbidden in Saudi Arabia but there is no mandatory death sentence for alcohol offences unless they are interpreted as \"corruption on earth\" under the kingdom's sharia law. Execution is by public beheading. There were 123 executions in the kingdom last year, for offences including murder, drug use, apostasy and witchcraft. There have been 17 so far this year. No westerner has ever been beheaded in the kingdom. In the expatriate community of Riyadh, Alexander Mitchell - \"Sandy\" to his friends - is known as an affable fellow, a man with good connections who can, if the need arises, pull a few strings. Among his Saudi acquaintances are interior minister Prince Nayef and Riyadh's chief of police. To those who know him, it was therefore all the more amazing when he appeared on Saudi television, apparently confessing to the bombing. \"It's totally bizarre,\" one long-standing friend, who asked not to be named, said yesterday. \"In the pictures of his confession he looks like he's under the influence of drugs. I know this man very very well. He's a very pleasant man.\" Prince Nayef, in an interview published yesterday, confirmed that Mr Mitchell, together with a Canadian and a Belgian, will be tried under sharia law which stipulates execution for convicted murderers. Murderers can sometimes avoid execution if relatives of the victim accept blood money in compensation, but Prince Nayef hinted that this might not be applicable. Under Saudi law, he said, there are \"the rights of the families of the dead man and those injured and then there is the public right, which is up to the government\". Saudi television showed the three accused separately as they confessed to planting the explosives in two cars in the Saudi capital last November and detonating them by remote control. Mr Mitchell, who is in his 40s, met Prince Nayef when the minister had an operation at the hospital. Like many other Britons in the kingdom, Mr Mitchell, became caught up in the illicit drinking activities that keep foreigners entertained, usually with the connivance of the Saudi authorities. \"Three years ago, one of the watering holes was raided by mutawwa [religious police] and a woman was arrested,\" a friend recalls. \"Sandy negotiated with the chief of police and helped to get her released six months later.\" Mr Mitchell appears to have dived into the world of drink more deeply than most. Busy \"He rented a complete compound of six villas,\" a friend recalls. \"He sublet five of them to expats and ran one villa as a pub. It was directly next to an American military installation, and was as busy as any pub in London.\" But it casts little light on why Mr Mitchell and two others now face murder charges. In any case, Mr Mitchell was no longer involved in the drinking den. \"He sold the business last year. As far as I know he wasn't directly involved in selling alcohol that way any more,\" a friend said. There are suggestions that the accused, and Christopher Rodway, the dead Briton who also worked at a hospital in Riyadh, had become entangled in an alcohol turf war. In their televised statements, the three men said they had been \"ordered\" to carry out the bombings - though they did not say who gave the order. Prince Nayef said last night that the kingdom knew who \"the source\" for the explosives was but \"in the interest of the investigation\" could not give more details now.

      "body": "<p>Strong performances from oil companies <strong> BP</strong> and <strong> Shell</strong> and a late cameo from <strong> BT</strong> were just enough to push leading shares higher yesterday. </p> <p>But while the final reading may have showed the FTSE 100 index 12.8 points ahead at 6,269.2, there was no hiding from the fact that the market remained in a fragile state. </p> <p>Once again, institutions were reluctant to take any decisions, preferring to wait on the sidelines ahead of this week's deluge of corporate results, and more importantly, the Bank of England meeting. </p> <p>Most economists expect the Bank's monetary policy committee to cut rates by 25 basis points this week. If it does, this would be the first cut since September 1999. But doubts persist. Domestic demand remains very strong, and the MPC may decide against moving before the Budget in March. </p> <p>Market turnover was weak, reaching just 1.7bn shares, leaving traders who had battled to work through the Tube strike wondering why they had bothered. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 index fell back 26.03 points to 2,706.19, dragged down by the Nasdaq, which failed to rally after a mauling on Friday, and a switch into defensive stocks ahead of today's results from networking company Cisco. </p> <p>If the figures from Cisco come up short - and given recent negative comments from chief executive John Chambers they could - sector watchers expect a rough ride for technology stocks. </p> <p>A sharp spike in the crude price at the back of end last week - the price of Brent rose almost $3 on Thursday and Friday as traders rushed to cover short positions - supported both BP, 11p better at 598p and Shell, 17p stronger 574p. But traders said both stocks could move lower today. </p> <p>After the markets' close Saudi Arabia's oil minister said no further Opec productions cuts were needed to support the oil price. </p> <p>Market gossip that the flotation of Orange, the mobile phone company controlled by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, will prove a success helped BT progress 28p to 729p. BT is planing to float its wireless unit in the second half of the year to help cut its debt. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>, off 2p to 238p, gave back some of Friday's gains as analysts delivered their verdict of the company's \"arrangement\" with fashion guru George Davies. Although there were some positive voices - Schroder Salomon Smith Barney upgraded its rating - the sceptics triumphed. Deutsche Bank reckons that there is still no evidence that the business has stabilised. </p> <p>In the meantime, a ruling in north America helped <strong> ScottishPower</strong> produce a gain of 16.5p to 480p. The Utah public service commission, which fixes retail power prices in the state, is going to allow ScottishPower to charge its customers 9.5% more for their electricity to compensate for rising power costs. </p> <p>Industrial gases group <strong> BOC</strong>, off 35p to 990p, was hit by selling pressure ahead of today's first quarter results, which are unexpected to make unpleasant reading. According to reports circulating the Square Mile yesterday, BOC's earnings growth in the first quarter is likely to be only half that analysts had expected. </p> <p>With the exception of <strong> Sema</strong> - up 54p to 449p after confirming takeover approaches - it was a pretty lacklustre affair lower down the corporate ladder. The FTSE Mid 250 index closed 10.7 points lower at 6,746.8. </p> <p>That said, <strong> Arena Leisure</strong>, the racecourse owner, advanced 16.5p to 104.5p on hopes its Go Racing consortium will shortly secure the rights to broadcast British horse racing. </p> <p>Insurance broker <strong> Jardine Lloyd Thompson</strong> perked up, rising 12.5p to 442.5p on the back of reports that Willis, the privately owned broker, is considering a merger. </p> <p>On the Alternative Investment Market <strong> Carbo</strong>, the metal grinding tools maker, was a strong performer, adding 1.5p to 10p on news that Peter Gyllenhammar, the active Swedish value investor, has built a 3.65% stake.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strong performances from oil companies BP and Shell and a late cameo from BT were just enough to push leading shares higher yesterday. But while the final reading may have showed the FTSE 100 index 12.8 points ahead at 6,269.2, there was no hiding from the fact that the market remained in a fragile state. Once again, institutions were reluctant to take any decisions, preferring to wait on the sidelines ahead of this week's deluge of corporate results, and more importantly, the Bank of England meeting. Most economists expect the Bank's monetary policy committee to cut rates by 25 basis points this week. If it does, this would be the first cut since September 1999. But doubts persist. Domestic demand remains very strong, and the MPC may decide against moving before the Budget in March. Market turnover was weak, reaching just 1.7bn shares, leaving traders who had battled to work through the Tube strike wondering why they had bothered. Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 index fell back 26.03 points to 2,706.19, dragged down by the Nasdaq, which failed to rally after a mauling on Friday, and a switch into defensive stocks ahead of today's results from networking company Cisco. If the figures from Cisco come up short - and given recent negative comments from chief executive John Chambers they could - sector watchers expect a rough ride for technology stocks. A sharp spike in the crude price at the back of end last week - the price of Brent rose almost $3 on Thursday and Friday as traders rushed to cover short positions - supported both BP, 11p better at 598p and Shell, 17p stronger 574p. But traders said both stocks could move lower today. After the markets' close Saudi Arabia's oil minister said no further Opec productions cuts were needed to support the oil price. Market gossip that the flotation of Orange, the mobile phone company controlled by France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, will prove a success helped BT progress 28p to 729p. BT is planing to float its wireless unit in the second half of the year to help cut its debt. Marks &amp; Spencer, off 2p to 238p, gave back some of Friday's gains as analysts delivered their verdict of the company's \"arrangement\" with fashion guru George Davies. Although there were some positive voices - Schroder Salomon Smith Barney upgraded its rating - the sceptics triumphed. Deutsche Bank reckons that there is still no evidence that the business has stabilised. In the meantime, a ruling in north America helped ScottishPower produce a gain of 16.5p to 480p. The Utah public service commission, which fixes retail power prices in the state, is going to allow ScottishPower to charge its customers 9.5% more for their electricity to compensate for rising power costs. Industrial gases group BOC, off 35p to 990p, was hit by selling pressure ahead of today's first quarter results, which are unexpected to make unpleasant reading. According to reports circulating the Square Mile yesterday, BOC's earnings growth in the first quarter is likely to be only half that analysts had expected. With the exception of Sema - up 54p to 449p after confirming takeover approaches - it was a pretty lacklustre affair lower down the corporate ladder. The FTSE Mid 250 index closed 10.7 points lower at 6,746.8. That said, Arena Leisure, the racecourse owner, advanced 16.5p to 104.5p on hopes its Go Racing consortium will shortly secure the rights to broadcast British horse racing. Insurance broker Jardine Lloyd Thompson perked up, rising 12.5p to 442.5p on the back of reports that Willis, the privately owned broker, is considering a merger. On the Alternative Investment Market Carbo, the metal grinding tools maker, was a strong performer, adding 1.5p to 10p on news that Peter Gyllenhammar, the active Swedish value investor, has built a 3.65% stake.",

There is no such list. Asylum seekers are free to purchase anything which is for sale in shops which accept the Buy-pass vouchers we issue to asylum seekers. Tesco head office is investigating this issue and if necessary will take action to ensure that the details of the voucher scheme are fully understood. Details of the store where the incident took place would be helpful. If your correspondent will provide this information I will see that it is immediately passed on. Barbara Roche MP Home Office minister Jill Allbrooke (Letters, February 2) made an apt feminist comment on David Lacey's football report, but I would rather bring attention to the wit of the evocative last words in his report of a disappointing game: \"even the lady streaker kept her knickers on\". It certainly warmed up a wintry morning for this male chauvinist. Kenneth Clark London It is indeed remarkable that wild boars have made such a comeback in the British Isles, especially since, according to your report, (Tusk force, G2, February 5), they appear to have achieved this feat without any wild sows. Simon Fisher Bradford-on-Avon, Wilts srfisher@onetel.net.uk I fail to see how a photograph of a full house at Cheltenham 11 months ago (Safe bet, Finance, February 5) is a relevant indicator of the Coral Group's financial position, good, bad or indifferent. Still, whatever their position, I'm sure I will continue my own crusade to improve it. Mike Bell Ashford, Kent",

      "body": "<p>The man is in town this week, and on the Nokia message board they're asking, \"Does anyone know how to get Stan as a ringer tone?\" Which is all very postmodern and interesting, since the hit song overtly references the brave new world of telecommunications: \"Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin' / I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom . . .\" </p> <p>The variety of possible ways in which the singer can get in touch with his doomed fan are appropriately overspecified, considering Slim (Eminem's persona) at first doesn't reply to his fan's obsessive letter. Eventually he does get round to writing back: \"Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy . . .\" He continues: \"I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you. / Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you.\" </p> <p>The irony in these lines is delicious, but just how good are Eminem's lyrics? Is all the fuss about him justified, or is it a case of hype over substance? In fact, a brief examination of Stan reveals it to have all the depth and texture of the greatest examples of English verse. To use the singer's own language, it's as \"fat\" as Robert Browning - and it is with the Victorian master of sly irony that Eminem's true \"underground\" work is done, just as much as with Scam and Ruckus, the bands noticed in the song. </p> <p>Of course, it's nothing new to make great claims for song lyrics. The work listed in The Poetry of Rock'n'Roll, a 1970s anthology, might seem banal (Donovan?), but it has long been the habit of the more flamboyant Cambridge English dons to put popular music under the full glare of hermeneutic inquiry. It was Christopher Ricks who started it off, writing about Dylan from the 1970s onwards. This Sunday, Ricks gives a talk on the subject on Radio 3. In Bob Dylan Among the Poets, he attacks the tired Keats v Dylan argument that his original pieces gave rise to. It was David Hare who set up the opposition, one that Ricks (quoting the recent Dylan song Not Dark Yet alongside Keats's Ode to a Nightingale) says is actually a unity. </p> <p>Other dons have followed suit: Eric Griffiths juxtaposing Talking Heads with William Empson in Cambridge lectures during the late 1980s. But it is rare for a singer to combine public outrage and textual richness in quite the way Eminem does. </p> <p>But who is he, really? Like the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, with his quiverful of pseudonyms, like the coy Eliot of Prufrock, or Walt Whitman's Song of Myself - \"Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes)\", Eminem is a multiple, elusive experience, one that folds about itself like his near-palindromic name (from Marshall Mathers: M 'n' M). </p> <p>Who the \"real Slim Shady\" is, in other words, is hard to say. As TS Eliot put it: \"The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, / It isn't just one of your holiday games; / You may think I'm as mad as a hatter / When I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.\" </p> <p>Like Macavity, Eminem always has an alibi, and one or two to spare. It is as if there were always someone else walking beside him. The mistake his critics make is to see the songs as direct statements by the singer rather than discrete aesthetic objects. Is it inconceivable that the man who wrote Stan should also want to stab you in the head \"if you're a fag or a les\"? Not necessarily, but Eminem's critics should \"relax a little\" as he advises Stan - should consider that this might be an artist toying with the place where celebrity and palatability meet, by passing deliberately inflammatory statements and by parodying less thoughtful rappers. </p> <p>The \"I\" voice has long been subject to modulation in English and American poetry. Browning's great dramatic monologues, such as My Last Duchess or Porphyria's Lover, are the classic examples of this. Other poets, including Tennyson, Hardy, Kipling, Frost, Pound and Eliot himself, also mastered the form. </p> <p>According to the Handbook to Literature, a dramatic monologue is a poem \"that reveals a 'soul in action' through the speech of one character in a dramatic situation. The character is speaking to an identifiable but silent listener at a dramatic moment in the speaker's life. The circumstances surrounding the conversation, one side of which we 'hear' . . . are made clear by implication, and an insight into the character of the speaker may result.\" </p> <p>In My Last Duchess, the speaker is an Italian duke who has had his flirtatious wife murdered, and is showing her portrait to (probably) an envoy from his next father-in-law. A \"picture on the wall\", as in the chorus to Stan, furnishes the occasion for the poem. </p> <p>Where Stan differs, and is in some respects more sophisticated - although it is a sophistication only possible in a mass-media, celebrity-driven world - is that both addressee and addresser speak in it. There is a further sophistication in so far as all listeners are in some sense co-opted into the Stan role. </p> <p>By ironically dramatising two sets of letters, Stan also fits snugly into the tradition of the verse epistle out of which the dramatic monologue developed. It shares, too, some qualities of unreliable narration with Porphyria's Lover, in which another murderer speaks. As with Stan (\"the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all\"), the weather fits the lunatic's mood: \"The rain set in early tonight, / The sullen wind was soon awake, / It tore the elm-tops down for spite.\" </p> <p>The speaker in Porphyria's Lover goes on to reveal how much Porphyria loved him - so much that to enable them to be together \"her hair / In one long yellow string I wound / Three times her little throat around, / And strangled her. No pain felt she . . .\" </p> <p>If we don't accuse Browning of misogyny and incitement to violence here, we should extend Eminem the same courtesy. We shouldn't fall into the trap of Stan himself, who tells Slim: \"See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it.\" </p> <p>It's clever that \"see\" - as if you might hear, behind the layers of impersonation, an authentic voice saying \"Can't you see ? This is a story, stupid\". It also has a touch of the bardic \"lo!\": the poet saying hey, look what I have made. </p> <p>Yet neither that voice nor even the one telling Stan that he's \"got some issues\" (you bet) and that he needs counselling and that he and his girlfriend need each other, can be said to be \"the true voice of Marshall Mathers\" any more than the incitements to sexual violence can. The younger fans who buy Eminem's albums probably understand this instinctively. Just as today's cinema-goers are more adept with movie conventions than their parents, so Eminem's youthful fans can see between the lines, and the publicity stunts, that the tabloids lap up so eagerly. The joke is on the editors, in fact. </p> <p>But what about those kids who do take it for real? As Mathers himself put it in an interview (sounding more like Paul Johnson than Public Enemy), \"There are kids out there who, believe it or not, want to be the have-nots.\" The question of how much sympathy or disdain Mathers has for them, for the Stans of the world, adds another dimension to the song. </p> <p>As does the question of how much he can be said to encourage them. To what extent, actually, can artists be held responsible for their works? This is a question poets have asked themselves for centuries, especially when dealing with tragic material. \"Go litel bok, go, litel myn tragedye\", said Chaucer, sending Troilus and Criseyde out into the world like a paper boat. He knew it wasn't as simple as that - though it isn't just a question of words being akin to deeds either. \"Did that play of mine send out / Certain men the English shot?\", Yeats asks, looking back on the Easter Rising in The Man and the Echo (Last Poems: 1936-39). Eminem's talent lies in his turning of these issues into the material of both his work and his personae. \"You could have rescued me from drowning,\" Stan writes; \"Why are you so mad?\" Slim replies, \"Try to understand . . .\" </p> <p>Try indeed. Stan, and much else in Eminem's oeuvre, explores humanity's most profound experience: not just madness, but also terror, melancholy and (not least) laughter. In this view Eminem is neither the \"authentic voice of disaffected working class youth\" (Independent on Sunday), nor \"a nasty little yob\"(ditto), but a rapper whose genius is, principally, poetic. </p> <p>You can hear that genius in the disposition of poetic stress in that opening verse of Stan - \"my cell, my pager and my home phone\". The pick-up of metre and sense between \"cell\" and \"phone\" puts a lot of weight on \"cell\" - making us think, perhaps, of the other type of cell might be in order for Stan. </p> <p>And of the phone tones themselves of course.

      "bodyText": "The man is in town this week, and on the Nokia message board they're asking, \"Does anyone know how to get Stan as a ringer tone?\" Which is all very postmodern and interesting, since the hit song overtly references the brave new world of telecommunications: \"Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin' / I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom . . .\" The variety of possible ways in which the singer can get in touch with his doomed fan are appropriately overspecified, considering Slim (Eminem's persona) at first doesn't reply to his fan's obsessive letter. Eventually he does get round to writing back: \"Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy . . .\" He continues: \"I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you. / Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you.\" The irony in these lines is delicious, but just how good are Eminem's lyrics? Is all the fuss about him justified, or is it a case of hype over substance? In fact, a brief examination of Stan reveals it to have all the depth and texture of the greatest examples of English verse. To use the singer's own language, it's as \"fat\" as Robert Browning - and it is with the Victorian master of sly irony that Eminem's true \"underground\" work is done, just as much as with Scam and Ruckus, the bands noticed in the song. Of course, it's nothing new to make great claims for song lyrics. The work listed in The Poetry of Rock'n'Roll, a 1970s anthology, might seem banal (Donovan?), but it has long been the habit of the more flamboyant Cambridge English dons to put popular music under the full glare of hermeneutic inquiry. It was Christopher Ricks who started it off, writing about Dylan from the 1970s onwards. This Sunday, Ricks gives a talk on the subject on Radio 3. In Bob Dylan Among the Poets, he attacks the tired Keats v Dylan argument that his original pieces gave rise to. It was David Hare who set up the opposition, one that Ricks (quoting the recent Dylan song Not Dark Yet alongside Keats's Ode to a Nightingale) says is actually a unity. Other dons have followed suit: Eric Griffiths juxtaposing Talking Heads with William Empson in Cambridge lectures during the late 1980s. But it is rare for a singer to combine public outrage and textual richness in quite the way Eminem does. But who is he, really? Like the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, with his quiverful of pseudonyms, like the coy Eliot of Prufrock, or Walt Whitman's Song of Myself - \"Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes)\", Eminem is a multiple, elusive experience, one that folds about itself like his near-palindromic name (from Marshall Mathers: M 'n' M). Who the \"real Slim Shady\" is, in other words, is hard to say. As TS Eliot put it: \"The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter, / It isn't just one of your holiday games; / You may think I'm as mad as a hatter / When I tell you a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES.\" Like Macavity, Eminem always has an alibi, and one or two to spare. It is as if there were always someone else walking beside him. The mistake his critics make is to see the songs as direct statements by the singer rather than discrete aesthetic objects. Is it inconceivable that the man who wrote Stan should also want to stab you in the head \"if you're a fag or a les\"? Not necessarily, but Eminem's critics should \"relax a little\" as he advises Stan - should consider that this might be an artist toying with the place where celebrity and palatability meet, by passing deliberately inflammatory statements and by parodying less thoughtful rappers. The \"I\" voice has long been subject to modulation in English and American poetry.

      "body": "<p>The Roman emperor Vespasian, while rebuilding his fire-ruined capital, was presented with a design for a lifting machine that would replace unskilled labourers. He prohibited its production, explaining: \"I must feed my poor.\" </p> <p>Technological advances have always threatened jobs: just look at what the combine did to agricultural employment. A Luddite before Ludd, Vespasian put the short-term protection of lower-paid workers before \"progress\". Today, of course, computers are held responsible for the loss of jobs. Jeremy Rifkin, in his book, The End of Work, warned that information technology could create massive joblessness. While former farm workers could go to the factory, and displaced factory workers could find a home in the office, there is nowhere, Rifkin reckoned, for displaced service-sector workers to go. </p> <p>With US employment levels at a record high, the inaccuracy of Rifkin's forecast, made just six years ago, seems clear. Capitalism stands accused of many crimes, but its capacity to keep creating demand, which people have to be employed to meet, seems limitless. </p> <p>The real question is not whether computers will end work - but how they will change it. Do they really make us more efficient? The blistering pace of productivity growth has been attributed to the widespread use of computer technology. Even Alan Greenspan says this, so it must be true. But new analysis of the effect of computers on productivity in 400 large US companies shows that is only half the story. </p> <p>Firms which introduced computerised systems alongside opportunities for employees to get involved - self-managing teams, devolved decision-making - ended up with a sharp rise in output per head. But the ones which simply stuck computers on desktops, with no change in organisational structure, were, on average, less productive than firms which hadn't installed computers at all. Bosses would have been economically better off standing in the car park, tearing up \u00a350 notes. The study proves the old truth about technology: it's what you do with it that counts. </p> <p>In one recent global survey, three-quarters of respondents said computers had made their lives better, with just 4% believing they had made them worse. But in the same survey, one in 10 said that advances in computer and internet technology had enabled them \"to work more\". This is a concern for many people - laptops, the internet and mobile phones have the potential to become the electronic tags of the modern employee. Joanne Ciulla, author of The Working Life, warns that information technology \"potentially makes us 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year employees\". </p> <p>Well, yes, it does. But it also makes us, potentially, 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year non-employees, too. It allows us to work as we wish. Perhaps at a steady pace, perhaps in intense bursts followed by long walks in the park. We can use our desktop or laptop computers as much for leisure as for work: the great thing about post-industrial skiving is that it looks exactly the same as post-industrial working. </p> <p>Smart companies have realised this and stopped trying to control computer use. There is no point banning personal emailing. Staff are increasingly expected to work outside \"normal\" hours, and they should be allowed to play within them in exchange. When computers are used creatively, they can loosen up rusting systems and allow all of us to work more flexibly and humanely. But it's not up to the computer. It is up to us. </p> <p>Networks are the production lines of the new economy. Keeping in touch with people is mission-critical.

      "bodyText": "The Roman emperor Vespasian, while rebuilding his fire-ruined capital, was presented with a design for a lifting machine that would replace unskilled labourers. He prohibited its production, explaining: \"I must feed my poor.\" Technological advances have always threatened jobs: just look at what the combine did to agricultural employment. A Luddite before Ludd, Vespasian put the short-term protection of lower-paid workers before \"progress\". Today, of course, computers are held responsible for the loss of jobs. Jeremy Rifkin, in his book, The End of Work, warned that information technology could create massive joblessness. While former farm workers could go to the factory, and displaced factory workers could find a home in the office, there is nowhere, Rifkin reckoned, for displaced service-sector workers to go. With US employment levels at a record high, the inaccuracy of Rifkin's forecast, made just six years ago, seems clear. Capitalism stands accused of many crimes, but its capacity to keep creating demand, which people have to be employed to meet, seems limitless. The real question is not whether computers will end work - but how they will change it. Do they really make us more efficient? The blistering pace of productivity growth has been attributed to the widespread use of computer technology. Even Alan Greenspan says this, so it must be true. But new analysis of the effect of computers on productivity in 400 large US companies shows that is only half the story. Firms which introduced computerised systems alongside opportunities for employees to get involved - self-managing teams, devolved decision-making - ended up with a sharp rise in output per head. But the ones which simply stuck computers on desktops, with no change in organisational structure, were, on average, less productive than firms which hadn't installed computers at all. Bosses would have been economically better off standing in the car park, tearing up \u00a350 notes. The study proves the old truth about technology: it's what you do with it that counts. In one recent global survey, three-quarters of respondents said computers had made their lives better, with just 4% believing they had made them worse. But in the same survey, one in 10 said that advances in computer and internet technology had enabled them \"to work more\". This is a concern for many people - laptops, the internet and mobile phones have the potential to become the electronic tags of the modern employee. Joanne Ciulla, author of The Working Life, warns that information technology \"potentially makes us 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year employees\". Well, yes, it does. But it also makes us, potentially, 24-hours-a-day, 365-days-a-year non-employees, too. It allows us to work as we wish. Perhaps at a steady pace, perhaps in intense bursts followed by long walks in the park. We can use our desktop or laptop computers as much for leisure as for work: the great thing about post-industrial skiving is that it looks exactly the same as post-industrial working. Smart companies have realised this and stopped trying to control computer use. There is no point banning personal emailing. Staff are increasingly expected to work outside \"normal\" hours, and they should be allowed to play within them in exchange. When computers are used creatively, they can loosen up rusting systems and allow all of us to work more flexibly and humanely. But it's not up to the computer. It is up to us. Networks are the production lines of the new economy. Keeping in touch with people is mission-critical. But there are only so many hours in the day, so new forms of meeting are being invented - and the latest is the Lunch That Is Never Eaten. It works like this: two people agree to have lunch and set a date. They then take it in turns to cancel - by email, of course - and the lunch is indefinitely pushed back. (A fair score on cancellations is vital.) If the two meet at a social function, they can say, honestly: \"Don't we have a date for lunch soon?

      "body": "<p>In her 1961 masterpiece, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs described Hudson Street, where she lived in Greenwich Village, New York. She loved it. There was Mr Slube at the cigar store and Mr Lacey, the locksmith, and Bernie, the sweetshop owner, who, during a typical day, supervised the children crossing the street, lent an umbrella or a dollar to a customer and \"lectured two youngsters who asked for cigarettes\". The street had \"bundles and packages, zigzagging from the drug store to the fruit stand and back over to the butcher's,\" and \"teenagers, all dressed up, are pausing to ask if their slips show or their collars look right\". It was, she said, an urban ballet. </p> <p>The miracle of Hudson Street, according to Jacobs, was created by the particular configuration of the streets and buildings. She argued that when a neighbourhood is oriented toward the street, when pavements are used for socialising and play and commerce, the users of that street are transformed by the resulting stimulation: they form relationships and casual contacts they would never have otherwise. </p> <p>But to reread Death and Life today is to be struck by how the intervening years have given her arguments a new relevance. Who, after all, has a direct interest in creating diverse, vital spaces that foster creativity and serendipity? Employers do. Forty years after its publication, Death and Life has been reborn as a primer on workplace design. </p> <p>Today, if you visit the technology companies of Silicon Valley, or the media companies of Manhattan, you'll find that secluded private offices have been replaced by busy public spaces, open-plan areas without walls, executives next to the newest arrivals. The hush of the traditional office has been supplanted by something much closer to the noisy, bustling ballet of Hudson Street. </p> <p>When employees sit chained to their desks, an office is not functioning as it should. As one study after another has demonstrated, the best ideas in any workplace arise out of casual contacts among different groups within the same company. If you are designing widgets for Acme.com, the most useful insights are likely to come from someone in customer service, who hears firsthand what customers have to say about them, or from someone in marketing, who has wrestled with the problem of how to explain widgets to new users. </p> <p>The catch is that getting people in an office to bump into people from another department is not that easy. As Thomas Allen, a researcher at MIT, concluded after a decade-long study, the likelihood of any two people communicating drops off dramatically as the distance between their desks increases: we are four times as likely to communicate with someone 6ft away as with someone 60ft away. And people seated more than 75ft apart hardly talk at all. </p> <p>The task of the office, then, is to invite a particular kind of social interaction - the casual, non-threatening encounter that makes it easy for relative strangers to talk to each other: in short, the sort of social milieu Jacobs found in Greenwich Village. </p> <p>Imagine a classic big-city office tower. The centre part of every floor is given over to the guts of the building: lifts, bathrooms, electrical and plumbing systems. Around the core are cubicles and interior offices, for support staff and lower management. And around the edges, against the windows, are rows of offices for senior staff. </p> <p>Research into office communication tells us there is almost no worse way to lay out an office. The executives in corner offices will seldom bump into each other. Indeed, stringing the exterior offices out along the windows guarantees very few people are within the critical 60ft radius of those offices. You need to put the most valuable staff members in the centre, or, even better, put all places where people congregate in the centre, so they can draw from as many disparate parts of the company as possible. </p> <p>Two years ago, the advertising agency TBWA/Chiat/Day moved into new offices in Los Angeles, creating an almost perfect embodiment of Jacobsian principles of community. The agency is in a huge old warehouse, three storeys high and the size of three football fields. It is informally known as Advertising City, and that is what it is: a kind of artfully constructed urban neighbourhood. The floor is bisected by a central corridor called Main Street, and in the centre of the room is an open space, with cafe tables and a stand of ficus trees, called Central Park. There's a basketball court, a games room and a bar. Most of the employees are in snug workstations known as nests, and the nests are grouped together in areas that radiate from Main Street like Paris arrondissements. </p> <p>The top executives are situated in the middle of the room. The desk of the chairman and creative director of the company looks out on Central Park. Sprinkled throughout the building are meeting rooms and project areas and nooks where employees can closet themselves. Part of the building is elevated above the main floor on a mezzanine, and if you stand there and watch the people wander about with their portable phones, sit and chat in Central Park, and play basketball in the gym, and you feel on your shoulders the sun from the skylights and listen to the gentle buzz of human activity, it is quite possible to forget that you are looking at an office. </p> <p>A vital community, in Jacobs's view, also needs a certain kind of person who can bind together the varied elements of street life. Offices are no different. In fact, office designers have become increasingly interested in identifying and encouraging public characters. One of the pioneers of this approach is Karen Stephenson, who runs a New York-based consulting company called Netform. She goes into a company - her clients include JP Morgan, the LA police department and IBM - and distributes a questionnaire asking employees about the people they have contact with. Whom do you like to spend time with? Whom do you talk to about new ideas? Every name in the company becomes a dot on a graph, and Stephenson draws lines between all those who have regular contact with each other. </p> <p>She likens her graphs to x-rays, and her role to that of a radiologist. What she's depicting is the firm's invisible inner mechanisms, the relationships, networks and patterns of trust that arise as people work together over time, and that are hidden beneath the organisation chart. </p> <p>Once, for example, Stephenson was doing an \"x-ray\" of an agency that was mostly female, and found that new staffers and male staffers were profoundly isolated, communicating with the rest of the organisation through only a handful of women. </p> <p>\"I couldn't see what tied the women together, and why the men were talking only to these women,\" Stephenson recalls. \"Nor could the president of the organisation. But finally, she asked me to read the names again, and I could hear her stop, and she said, 'My God, I know what it is. All those women are smokers'.\" The x- ray revealed that the men were trying to gain access and influence by hanging out in the smoking area with some of the more senior women. </p> <p>What Stephenson's x-rays do best, though, is tell you who the public characters are. In every network there are always one or two people with connections to many more people than anyone else. Stephenson calls them \"hubs\", and on her charts lines radiate out from them like spokes on a wheel. A few others are what Stephenson calls \"gatekeepers\": they control access to critical people, and link together a strategic few disparate groups. Finally, there are people with lots of indirect links to other people - who are part of all sorts of networks without necessarily being in the centre of them. Stephenson calls those people \"pulsetakers\". </p> <p>\"You want to place hubs at the centre,\" says Joyce Bromberg, the director of space planning at Steelcase, the giant manufacturer of office equipment. Stephenson is helping redesign its headquarters in Michigan. \"These are the ones other people go to in order to get information. Give them an environment that allows access. Gatekeepers represent the fit between groups. They transmit ideas. They are brokers, so you might want to put them at the perimeter and give them front porches [areas adjoining the workspace where you might put tables and chairs]. As for pulsetakers, they are the roamers. Rather than give them one fixed work location, give them a series of touchdown spots where you want them to stop and talk, so enabling their meandering.\" </p> <p>The point of the new offices is to compel us to behave and socialise in ways that we otherwise would not - to overcome our initial inclination to be office suburbanites. But, in all the studies of the new workplaces, the reservations that employees have about a more social environment tend to diminish once they try it. Jacobs knew the virtues of Greenwich Village because she lived there. What she couldn't know was that her ideas about community would ultimately make more sense in the workplace. </p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this article appeared in the New Yorker.</p>",

Byron, a black 17-year-old, is accused, on the basis of a suspiciously full confession, of murdering his mother's lover. Meanwhile three High Court judges - the staid Keith, the frisky Elspeth and the amiably liberal Fred - are confined together in a safe provincial house while they execute the local law. Byron's case is being tried before the stern, unbending, Angelo-like Keith. But when Elspeth invites an accountant back to dinner one night, it transpires that he has a blackmailing stranglehold over this most upright judge. </p> <p>Mortimer understands well the nooks and crannies of the law and the gap between its presumed impartiality and the fallibility of its executants. He not only shows Byron's odious prosecutor making a clumsy pass at his female opponent over a chummy, eve-of-case dinner; he also, in the play's best scenes, shows the well-intentioned Fred putting the screws on the supposedly incorruptible Keith in the interests of natural justice. The law, Mortimer implies, will always be an imperfect instrument as long as it is in the hands of flawed, susceptible human beings. </p> <p>This humane and sympathetic play is also, however, flawed. We never learn enough about the circumstantial details of Byron's alleged crime to make up our minds about his innocence or guilt; you feel Mortimer possibly knows less about black teenagers than he does about High Court judges. His admirable desire to entertain also overcomes his representation of the sometimes wearisome legal process. Revealingly, he remarks in the programme: \"You can't afford to have a second of boredom in thetheatre or the whole thing collapses\". But Hamlet, Faust, Peer Gynt, all great plays, have their moments of ennui: boredom is the price you pay for excavation of the truth. </p> <p>No danger of boredom here, however. Certainly not while Leslie Phillips as the bumbling Fred is putting the case for judicial lenience. Phillips fluffs his lines and flirts with the audience but he has the instinctive timing of the born comic and can even get a huge laugh from the word \"blimey\", which, according to Ackroyd's London, is \"fading out of discourse\". Nicholas Jones as the hollow pillar of the law, Anna Carteret as the sex-hungry Elspeth and Geraldine Alexander as the harrassed defence counsel for Byron lend firm support in Christopher Morahan's well-drilled production . </p> <p>And if the play appeals to our own sense of tolerance, it is because Mortimer himself is clearly on the side of the angels and against the judicial Angelos. </p> <p> Until February 24.

But it is the one work of his that has remained consistently in the repertory from the day it was first performed. </p> <p>Composed by Haydn in the astonishing last decade of his life, when he threw most of his energy into choral music, it glows from end to end with a serene optimism about the beauty of the world and the glory of human life. </p> <p>Although John Milton's Paradise Lost was among his literary sources, Adam and Eve are portrayed without the slightest hint of the fall that is to come. </p> <p>None of Haydn's operas has ever made it to the repertory, partly because none of them contains the musically fuelled dramatic tension that opera needs.

      "bodyText": "The Creation is heard and recorded less often today than some of Haydn's symphonies, quartets and concertos. But it is the one work of his that has remained consistently in the repertory from the day it was first performed. Composed by Haydn in the astonishing last decade of his life, when he threw most of his energy into choral music, it glows from end to end with a serene optimism about the beauty of the world and the glory of human life. Although John Milton's Paradise Lost was among his literary sources, Adam and Eve are portrayed without the slightest hint of the fall that is to come. None of Haydn's operas has ever made it to the repertory, partly because none of them contains the musically fuelled dramatic tension that opera needs. So The Creation was the perfect medium for him: all narrative, interspersed with stirring choruses that see humanity in the unshadowed positive light of the late 18th century. The difficulty in a performance is to find some way of giving shape and tension to almost two hours of this optimism. Allow it to become unremitting prettiness and you are sunk.

After the focused, arresting anger of Der Atlas, pianist Wolfram Rieger changed the mood to one of absolute stillness for Ihr Bild, while in Das Fischerm\u00e4dchen Hampson proved, with his agile and surprisingly delicate ornamentation, that his voice is not too cumbersome an instrument for Schubert's lighter Lieder.

He began with five settings of poetry by Walt Whitman. The martial piano music of Henry T Burleigh's Ethiopia, saluting the colours, took us briefly back to the world of the more substantial Mahler songs. But the most effective setting was not by a native American; Hindemith's version of Sing On There in the Swamp, with its atmospheric, chiming accompaniment and sinuous vocal lines, was written after he emigrated from war-torn Germany. </p> <p>The art and folk songs that finished the concert were more pared down, with the exception of Stephen White's overblown arrangment of Shenandoah.
